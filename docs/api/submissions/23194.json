I get it, \"age is just a number\" but if you were a man and your partner was a woman everyone would be screaming about how she's too young for you. Twenty-four is super young, especially when you have a 13 year old. It's probably really tough for her to watch her mom have a relationship with someone who's only ten years older than her.

You chose this, she didn't, and she is lashing out. Reason why I know this, is because I was at one point in the same shoes as your daughter, and it took me literally getting into a physical fight with my dad for him to see things from my point of view. I'm now on great terms with my dad, but I will always have those memories in the back of my mind, telling me to keep an eye out for some deja moo(\"smelled this BS before\", for those interested in the definition).

And expecting them to be cool with a partner who is closer in age to the kid than the parent is a BIG ask, that very few children (kids or adults) are ok with. Much less in the turbulent teen years.\n\nAlso, he is almost young enough to be your kid. (I mean, if you were a teen mom, he IS young enough to be your kid). As long as all parties are consenting, that's not inherently a problem, but... it is always gonna skeeve out your kid, imo. (and you see it plenty with kids where dads are dating a much younger girlfriend too.

And why is he visiting? This is not a serious stepdad situation, this is a fling. So yes, it is your daughter's business.\n\nI seriously hope you're not in America, because this sort of thing can lose you custody over your kid.

That her comfort is second to your feelings and the feelings of men you date and 2. That you don\u2019t consider her concerns to have merit. The age concern does have merit. It does. The brain is fully developed somewhere near 25 years of age. It can vary person to person, but it is reasonable to exercise caution or decline to engage sexually and romantically with someone under that age, if you yourself are well above that age.

It is not good to dismiss valid concerns and discomfort in her home. Take her seriously, compromise.

In spite of the age gap, I feel like this is the best relationship I've been in in years, as me and Jack click on essentially every level, sharing several common interests and enjoying each other's company immensely. Plus, the sex is probably the best I've ever had. After a long dry spell since me and my daughter's father got divorced, I needed this.\n\nThe problem is, my daughter Nandini (F13) doesn't approve of Jack at all. The main reasons she lists for disapproving are the age difference as well as the fact that we're Indian and Jack is white (Nandini was born here while I immigrated in '05). Thus, she refuses to speak or even acknowledge Jack when he visits, even though Jack's been nothing but nice to her. \n\nRecently, I overheard Nandini on the phone with her father complaining about Jack, referring to him as \"Mom's man whore\" and railing against both him and me for being together. I waited for her to hang up and then started scolding her for insulting my relationship, to which she responded that what I was doing was unnatural, that while I was entitled to move on from her father, my relationship was completely inappropriate. I then told her that what I choose to do with my love life is none of her business and that she'd just have to deal with it. We haven't spoken for the last few days over this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Stop this \"oh boo hoo poor me\" bullshit, you were the one that chose to have a child. Grow the fuck up! \n\nYou need to figure out a way to date that doesn't ruin your relationship with your only daughter. Millions of parents figure it out - you can too. But first you need to stop with the entitled attitude and take responsibility for your choices.", "You date in a way that she's not involved in it.", "You date without involving your daughter. Dude stays away when she\u2019s around. Trying to live with him? forget about it, you see your daughter is in distress over it? she\u2019s a teen and should be your priority until she\u2019s an ADULT.", "\n\n>So I should just hold off from dating until she's in college? \n\nyou could always try dating someone age appropriate", "To balance out the scales.", "if you need a 20 year younger boy toy to be happy, you have other problems", "Edited to clarify. OP is TA and seems like a narcissist.", "Then that culture needs to change, the mom is not an AH for not being in a traditional relationship.\n\nAnd nowhere in the post does it say that the daughter is catching grief from it at school.", "*riding", "You have 20 years more experience in relationships and life in general. That is a power imbalance even if it isn\u2019t being exploited intentionally. \n\nThat age gap is literally the age gap between myself and my older brother. The only time I don\u2019t see relationships like this as gross, is when the youngest is your age or older.\n\nEdit: the age between the boyfriend and the daughter is the gap between my brother and me. Not the gap between OP and the boyfriend.", "The something is very wrong with you. You shouldn't be at the same maturity level as a 24 year old.", "you\u2019re not tho, not when you\u2019re almost twice his age", "No you aren\u2019t.", "There is always a power imbalance in massive age gap relationships", "does he have his own place? does he make as much as you? do you share expenses equally?", "It's still weird as hell. Legal? Yes. Morally right? No.", "Just because it's legal, doesn't make it morally right.", "It's fine from a legal sense. It's still icky IMO from a power dynamic sense. In my experience, 24yos are still extremely na\u00efve. So while it might seem cool to be dating someone twice your age, you don't have the life experience to understand when you're being taken advantage of. I'm not saying that's what OP is doing, but people in their 40s don't tend to have a lot in common with people in their early-20s, and therefore usually aren't interested in dating them unless it's to exploit them.", "Yeah I was shocked to see the YTA so high. He's a grown ass man.", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one! Still missing how long it took mother of the year to introduce this dude to her child tho\u2026", "You are the one that made it sound as if that relationship is only so \"mommy wants to get laid\"", "24 is far enough from 13 that if you hear about that age difference (assuming the girl is older than 13 of course) you will not feel okay with it either. \n\nWhile the mom describes that her daughter doesn't want to interact with him, I don't see anything that says she forced her to be nicer or anything. In fact, the confrontation came when the daughter was dissing them on the phone with the ex. \n\nIs their relationship really \"unnatural\"? I don't think so and if it was an older man nobody would have bat an eye here.", "your boy toy is young enough to be her brother. she absolutely is allowed to mad about it.", "It doesn\u2019t. But did you ever ask yourself if your new boyfriend being in your home makes her uncomfortable? If that might present an issue? Because it is not only your home, it\u2019s hers as well and if she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with him being there, he shouldn\u2019t be. Especially since you mentioned the sexual aspect several times and how important that is to you.", "The fact that OP knows of the two concerns (age and race) tells me that she has attempted to talk to her daughter about the issues with the bf and that's all the daughter will disclose. Of course they should keep lines of communication open and she needs to keep checking with her daughter to make sure nothing goes sideways. All that being said, I think it's perfectly normal for a 13 year old to be freaked out with her mother dating someone closer to her age instead of theirs so OP should show some grace in that regard. The racism needs to be a hard stop and doesn't need to be validated.", "Nope mom needs to help her with her feelings first. Getting dick shpuldnt be a priority. She can buy a toy.", "I would disagree with that. As I've been growing up most of my friends have always been taught that we need to be respectful to whoever our parents date. If she wants to respectfully disapprove that's fine, but calling the man a w**** without knowing him and knowing his level of seriousness is not acceptable. I would have been expected to treat my elders with respect especially those who have been kind to me, and as her mother I would expect it to. If he does something bad then we can talk about it but nothing bad has happened here.", "Having a partner closer to your child\u2019s age than your own is almost always inappropriate. It\u2019s also inappropriate when your child has expressed concern and instead of being parent, says too bad, I value sex with a hot young guy instead of your feelings. It\u2019s also inappropriate to even considering moving in a man that your daughter does not like and has only met 2-3 times especially when they have known each other for less than a year.", "just because its legal does make it appropriate. he's young enough to be her son, and closer in age to her daughters than her.", "Having a partner closer to your child\u2019s age than your own is almost always inappropriate.

That\u2019s not an inherent issue. But if it\u2019s too often then yeah there\u2019s a level of emotional negligence", "It\u2019s completely normal and ok to be home alone at 13.

I have zero problem with a parent leaving their teenager at home while they go on a date.", "If he's not doing anything to actually hurt the child or the mother, then you have no leg to stand on so you don't. The ages are uncommon but that's it. That doesn't give her the right to call her mother's boyfriend disrespectful names nor does it give her the right to treat him with disrespect. Any guest in her home for any reason should be treated with respect and the girl needs to learn how to behave. The real reason she's having a tantrum is because she wants her mother to get back with her father and it's obviously not going to happen.", "Can you explain how it\u2019s a power imbalance? I just don\u2019t understand that.", "Theres a reas9n she probly wont date people her age...", "That doesn\u2019t answer my question. And honestly fail to see where the morally wrong part is.", "nah, just let people fuck. There is no power dynamic here. When I was in my early 20s I slept with women in their late 30s early 40s and I knew exactly what I was doing.   \n\n\nAt 24 I ran a business, I went where I wanted to go, I did what I wanted to do, I had all the life experiences I needed to navigate every encounter I had.  \n\n\nStop infantilizing people.", "For sure, in general - but there are exceptions and sometimes people click in a way that surprises then despite a considerable gap. (I say this as someone in their 20s dating someone in their 30s). I get your points, I'm just surprised to see so many people saying it's automatically icky without more information", "To me it\u2019s not the age that makes OP YTA. Who cares about their age gap when hes 24. It\u2019s OP telling her daughter that her opinion does not matter and not discussing or having a serious discussion about how her daughters feelings.\n\nEdit. Spelling", "I mean, I still think OP needs to examine what this relationship means to her daughter and handle it in a better way, but she can sleep with anyone of any legal consenting age without judgement on my part.", "Shes not TA just because of the age gap, she's TA for parading it in front of her daughter and not caring about her feelings on it.", "Young teenagers are not the best at verbalizing their emotions and justifying them. There is likely something deeper going on. If OP can't figure out what it is, she can go to therapy with her daughter or keep her SO at arm's length. Whether or not the concerns are \"valid\", the daughter should be the first priority.", "you are not inherently owed respect for being older or being a parent. given ops immature reaction, it's not a surprise her daughter is not respectful of her.", "It sounds like it's not just sex it's a relationship. If he treats it as a relationship and he's behaving in a mature fashion then he's proven he's enough of a grown up to be her partner. His age is none of the daughter's business.", "really depends on the maturity of the 13yo though.", "When one party has a lot more experience than another, in this case by 20+ years, it can leave the younger party with a harder time identifying problematic behavior, especially if they\u2019ve never had other relationships or serious relationships. It can lead to abuse in many different forms. A lot of 24 year olds are going to be barely out of college/just graduating college, which is a very different situation from someone who would be well established in work and having a family. The woman\u2019s daughter will have been starting to prepare for college exams like SATs. It\u2019s like watching your parent date your brother with that age gap, so there\u2019s that as well. \n\nIt isn\u2019t always something that is exploited, but it is a risk with age gaps like this. The older the younger party is, the less likely this is to be a problem because they have more life experience. I won\u2019t date someone more than 10-13 years older than me for this reason and even that\u2019s a pretty significant gap depending on my age vs theirs at the time.", "What the hell does a 40+ year old have in common with a 20+ year old? Absolutely nothing. OP is being selfish in her decisions and inappropriate, completely disregarding her daughter's feelings and has the intent on making a 24 year old her 13 year old daughter's STEPFATHER.\n\nIt's incredibly bizarre and borders on midlife crisis.", "If this was just a physical thing, then yeah. Have at it. But OP mentioned maybe marrying him someday. This sounds more like a mid-life crisis than good judgement.", "If the younger person is younger than 30, I use the 'half your age plus 7' rule to determine if this relationship is questionable. If the younger person is older than 30, I say do what you want because at that point everyone should be experienced enough to know what they're getting into. \n\nCould he be incredibly mature, completely self-sufficient, and very experienced in the dating world? Sure. Is it likely? No. That's all I'm saying.", "With you 100%.", "he's young enough to be her brother, and she has to live with him if he moves in. it absolutely is her business", "Being older doesn\u2019t always equate to more experience. \n\nAnd everyone in life are in different situations not every 20 year old is the same. This honestly just seems like a extremely generalized view of things. \n\nLike yeah they could be taken advantage of a 20 year can take advantage of a 20 year. Shit 20 year olds can take advantage of 80 year olds.", "To say a 40 year old and a 20 have absolutely nothing in common is genuinely a brain dead statement. \n\nAs for the stuff about about the dynamics with the daughter yes you are correct.", "It's her business in the sense that she has the right to know but she does not have any right to police it. If the 24-year-old was a girl and the 42-year-old was the father we wouldn't be talking about this at all. And he seems like an older 24-year-old, so he might be from somewhere where people get married by 25 to 30 and thinks nothing of this. At the end of the day it's her mom's relationship. As long as he behaves well as a grown up, there's nothing really to complain about.", "I never said it always did. I specifically mentioned things like more relationship experience and such. I know the younger party can take advantage of the old. However, it is often the younger party who doesn\u2019t know what the hell they are doing. \n\nMy mother is dating someone 20 years older right now. Healthiest relationship she\u2019s ever had. But she is also almost 50 and has had way more experience than me for example if I were to date someone her age. \n\nI also mentioned how it\u2019s not always exploited, yet you seemed to ignore this.", "Sure, have the same music taste, have the same likes in TV shows, hobbies, etc. But mentally, two very different ages, two very different stages in life, stay in your own lane/age region.\n\nThe whole situation is weird.", "\n\n>If the 24-year-old was a girl and the 42-year-old was the father we wouldn't be talking about this at all. \n\nI abso-fucking-luttly would. I would be saying the same exact thing if op was a guy. date people your own fucking age.", "So are you saying all 20 year olds are of the same mentality, stages in life? People are incredibly variant creatures it\u2019s probably best not to assume you know where everyone is at. \n\nDo agree the situation is weird though."]}
