We dated for almost two years. He had a roommate Shane (32m) and I thought Shane and Tammy would be a good match. I set up a double date with the four of us and Tammy and Shane hit it off and have been dating ever since. They recently got engaged and are planning their wedding. \n\nSome necessary context before I continue: Nick was an alcoholic and abusive. He cheated on me with multiple other women. He eventually turned to drugs, and I managed to escape after almost a year of psychological abuse that had turned physical. Tammy and Shane knew this but still, Nick and Shane remain good friends to this day. \n\nMoving on to present day.\n\nTammy asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding (her sister is her maid of honor) and I found out Nick was also going to be a groomsman. Granted, I was aware that Nick and Shane were friendly this whole time, but I didn\u2019t know they remained this close. \n\nI decided to talk to my therapist about it first before I confronted Tammy. My therapist recommended I set some boundaries, because I really didn\u2019t want to miss my best friend\u2019s wedding and have my ex take yet another moment from my life. \n\nI told Tammy I was feeling really nervous about having to see Nick. Initially, she didn\u2019t understand because it\u2019s been ten years since I\u2019ve last seen or spoken to him, and I\u2019m married now. I agreed that Nick is in my past and I\u2019ve processed it, but that I don\u2019t know what it will feel like to see him again and set these boundaries:\n\n1. Sit us at different tables. \n2. Let me walk down the aisle with another groomsman.\n3. If there are moments when the bridal party is hanging out together, like to take pictures, etc., let me husband be there. \n4. Don\u2019t make me stand next to him or touch him in photos.\n\nTammy\u2019s response was awful. She kicked me out of the wedding, and said no matter what, she was now going to have anxiety about me and Nick at her wedding and she shouldn\u2019t have any more stress on that day. I even reassured her I was working with my therapist, but she didn\u2019t care. When I confronted her about having Nick at her wedding at all, she snapped at me and said she\u2019s not going to tell Shane what to do and can\u2019t control his friends. \n\nTammy hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. She unfollowed me on social media and it\u2019s been months now. I don\u2019t want to reach out first, because I feel like this isn\u2019t my fault, but it\u2019s hard to believe this is just the end?

I confronted my best friend about having my abusive ex as a groomsman in her bridal party, which she felt added stress to an already stressful experience. Now we are no longer speaking, and I don\u2019t think I have to reach out to her or owe her an apology. \n\n2. This might have made me the asshole because I burdened her by telling her this before her wedding day, and because I knew her fianc\u00e9 and my ex were friends for years. If someone were to deem me the asshole, it could be justified, as I burdened my friend and could have declined being in the bridal party up front, rather than accepting and then confronting my friend. I also could be seen as the asshole as this a personal problem that I could have dealt with on my own or with my therapist, rather than burdening or telling my friend at all. Finally, me choosing not to reach out could make me the asshole, and maybe I should be the one reaching out and trying to remedy the situation.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n# [Check out our upcoming Reddit Talk With John Hodgman on January 18th @ 7pm EST](https://redd.it/109b8y5)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Having him at his wedding, in the wedding party, where the woman he abused is despicable.\n\nBut, what really baffles me is that your ***best friend*** is totally cool with your abuser being at her wedding, in the wedding party, and then wanted you to be in her wedding party and act like everything's cool. This is, of course, not even getting started on her tantrum over you (rightfully) not wanting to be around your abuser.\n\nI would never have been in the wedding party. I would not have attended the wedding. And even before her reaction to you, I would have ended this relationship and cut ties as soon as she made it clear she cared more about keeping the peace with my abuser than she did me.\n\nBut the good news is...This insufferable asshole beat you to it and decided to remove you from this entire mess of a situation. And while I'm genuinely sorry you are hurting and that this happened, I think it's a good thing that you have an excuse to cut all future attempts at contact. She wasn't a friend to you, and clearly didn't care at all about how any of this made you feel.\n\nJust so we're clear though, you're literally the only person in this entire situation that isn't an asshole.", "NTA. Your friend is though. You asked for help in managing your anxiety about being in a wedding party with your physically, emotionally and psychologically abusive ex and she blew up? Nope. Nope. Nope. Not a good friend.", "NTA at all. You deserve better. You deserved better than a friend who would let your abuser stay in their life as a friend, even if just a casual one through her bf. \n\nYou were willing to put yourself in an uncomfortable and possibly traumatic situation for her and she wasn't willing to give a few small concessions or even compassionately let you know she couldn't accommodate you. She is a bad friend. You are a good one.", "NTA - The boundaries you asked /set are not unrealistic.  This guy was abusive to you.  My ex was the same way.  I dealt with 12 yrs of his abuse.  If my best friend was getting married and wanted me to stand in her wedding but told me my ex was also going to be in the wedding I'd feel the same way.  With that being said, my true friends would never put me in that situation.  I'm sorry but if she's cut you off over something like this, she was never really a friend.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to set up boundaries concerning Nick. I can understand that wedding planning is difficult, but Tammy's reaction is extreme and pretty inexcusable. Good luck!", "NTA.\n\n>Nick was an alcoholic and abusive. He cheated on me with multiple other women. He eventually turned to drugs, and I managed to escape after almost a year of psychological abuse that had turned physical. Tammy and Shane knew this\n\nIt doesn't matter how long ago this was. I wouldn't do this to you and I'm a stranger - she's supposed to be your friend.", "Ummm excuse me, your best friend is hanging out with your abuser and having him as a groomsman? Lady, can you take a step back and see how fucked up this is? She is not your friend, be grateful you do not have any contact anymore. NTA", "NTA Look, my abusive ex got the majority of our friend group and the whole freaking province in the divorce. It sucks. It sucks when you are told that YOU are the problem when you nicely explain your boundaries and feelings. Sucks even more when people dismiss your abuse because they 'never saw him do it' (yes, I am projecting lol).\n\nI occasionally miss my 'friends' and the events that I used to be able to attend. But nowadays I have a whole friend group who love me and support me, new things to do, including things he never allowed me to do. I am overall happy and if I regret anything its the 8 miserable years I allowed him to tear me down.\n\nStay strong. Believe in yourself and your ability to move forward with true friends. Lean on your husband and those who have been there and understood your trauma. Do not allow someone like her to affect all these years of recovering, she does not deserve the person you are today.", "NTA. She's an absolutely shifty friend. She cares more about her finances abusive friend than you who has been in her life longer. You deserve better", "NTA.  If Tammy knows what Nick did to you and doesn't care, she's either not your friend, or Shane's doing the same stuff to her.", "NTA, but unfortunately it is Tammy's wedding so she is allowed to make those choices.  I'm sorry this is happening, but I do wonder if Nick hasn't spent time telling her, and her fiance a pack of lies to make it look like he never did anything wrong.  That's a classic move for abusers.  Her reaction tells me that's what he's done.", "NTA. I wouldn't have blamed you for straight up saying you won't even be present at the wedding as a guest, let alone won't be in the same wedding party. The fact that you were still willing to be in the same party as your abuser but just wanted some basic steps taken to limit your interactions is pretty incredible to me. She has the option of saying we can't accommodate these things and then you would have had a decision to make. Her response took that off the table and if she can't see why you wouldn't want to interact with your abuser, no matter how much time has elapsed, she and the groom are most definitely TAH.", "NTA but I\u2019d just plan on not going to the wedding and send your best wishes. She (selfishly) doesn\u2019t want to deal with all of this on her day. Your requests were not unreasonable. It sounds like her mind is made up though.", "This person is not your bezt friend. NTA.", "NTA Friends don't hang out with abusers of other friends. That's a really HARD LINE that should have been considered. I feel like it's the abuser that should be ostracized from the group, but, humans are human, and do messed up stuff.  I am really sorry your friend can't see this.", "NTA.   You\u2019re still young and I\u2019d let this friendship go if your friend\u2019s partner is still friends with your abuser knowing what he did to you.   Make a clean break.", "NTA\n\nShe's not your friend. I genuinely hope you find people who care about you more than she does soon.", "NTA. Tammy showed you who she is. She chose your abuser over you. That is what she thinks of your friendship. Move on and don't look back.", "NTA.  Tammy, however, is being an AH.  You really aren't asking for much.  You just don't want to be shoulder to shoulder with a man who was abusive to you. That is not much effort for your friend of 15+ years to make.

Good people don't want to associate with abusers, and both Tammy and Shane stayed friends with him *and* got mad when OP had very reasonable requests. \n\nIt made me so sad when I read in another comment that OP thinks it's reasonable for Tammy to have forgotten it. That's not normal. When you're friend is hurt, especially that type of hurt, you don't forget it. And while it's true she can't control who her partner is friends with, she chose to continue dating him.

I will say this though, if I was dating a guy who I found out had a best friend who physically abused his girlfriend in the past, I'd stop dating them. Though I can understand your perspective, and I can see why you figured it was just in the past.\n\nBut, yes, them allowing your abuser to be in the wedding party and then expecting you to be cool with it is absolutely unforgivable in my opinion. And, as harsh as it may sound, I think she just did you the biggest favor of your life removing you from this situation.\n\nAnd, yes, please talk to your therapist about all of this for closure. And please be sure to block her EVERYWHERE, I truly believe she just thinks you're going to cave and reach out to apologize and that she's just gaslighting you to try and get her way without having to acknowledge how wrong she is for this mess.", "OP, would you be this close with a guy who abused your friend? Would you want them around in such an important event? Would you behave like your \"friend\" if it was your wedding and this girl had been abused by your husband's friend?

Your \"friends\" don't think about you the same way you think about them, so don't cave in. Don't reach out.

You'll see how you will have more space in your life for friendships that truly go both ways and where you will feel respected.", "Understandable.

You did not deserve to be treated so horribly. \n\nHowever, be grateful Tammy has kicked you out of the wedding and has literally unfriended you. \n\nShe does not value or your friendship. \n\nBy inviting Nick over you she has shown you that you don\u2019t matter. Or more likely that she takes you for granted and expects you to be waiting for her to circle round on the merry go round called life to pick up the friendship. \n\nMove on. \n\nMake new friends. \n\nEnjoy your life.\n\nBe happy with your husband.\n\nThat will be the best gift to yourself", "I 100% guarantee that she has been convinced that he never abused you and you're just being dramatic.

There's something about weddings where you get to see your friends true colors.", "NTA- You have a really resilient and sweet soul and i say this gently but Tammy doesn't deserve you and isn't really a good friend for you.\n\nTammy and Shane are a couple and she was bound to know how close Shane and Nick are. She is staying with a guy who knows about the abuse you went through and is willing to sweep it aside.", "NTA. The fact that Nick and Shane remained friends is pretty disgusting. Tammy completely refusing to take any action regarding an ex who abused you, and then kicking you from the bridal party + blocking you\u2026 well, maybe that\u2019s a sign that your friendship didn\u2019t mean as much to her as it does to you. I would never accept an abuser into my friend circle, regardless of whether it was through myself or my partner.", "NTA. You set out some very reasonable boundaries to make yourself feels safe. As your \"best friend\" she should understand this. The fact that it's been 10 years doesn't matter, there is no time limit for trauma.", "[removed]", "NTA. Please know this deep in your heart and release yourself from the pain of this entire situation. \n\nI am so disappointed that your friend was so blinded by her own wedding that she couldn't understand the situation she was putting you in. You were beyond reasonable. \n\nI wonder if Nick is in recovery and this is contributing to Tammy's reaction. I also wonder if your reasonable, measured and thoughtful response is triggering to her because she's concerned about Shane's friendship with Nick, after all Nick has revealed himself to be and done to you. \n\nRegardless, you have done what you can. I'm glad you have a supportive husband and a capable therapist. I'm sorry you no longer have Tammy because of your shared history, but I'm not sorry you no longer have a friend who doesn't have your best interests at heart. \n\nLastly, if you're looking for any measure of satisfaction (if you can call it that) going forward, if anyone mentions you not being in Tammy's wedding or not being a part of it, simply say you decided not to be in the presence of your abuser. And his participation in the wedding was chosen above yours. Let that simmer in the social networks. \n\nBest of luck.", "NTA. You did what you had to do to protect yourself from your former abuser. Even if it\u2019s 10 years in the past, It does not change the fact that he\u2019s your abuser and that he could still verbally or physically abuse you again if the opportunity presents itself. He may or may not, and it\u2019s the fear that\u2019s present that\u2019s causing your anxiety. That\u2019s a natural reaction to abuse. \n\nYou took the proactive and responsible approach to discuss it with your therapist and try to be mature about it. You set more or less reasonable boundaries for the wedding. Though, I do think sitting at an entirely different table wasn\u2019t necessary. Especially if you\u2019re on opposite ends of a rectangle table with the bride and groom center. You would not have been near him. \n\nIf there\u2019s any assholery to be had in this scenario , it\u2019s that Tammy coldly demonstrated that your friendship is not as important to her as it is to you. If kicking you out wasn\u2019t enough, she completely ghosted you and dropped you as a friend. She\u2019s indicated that she\u2019s not interested in the relationship anymore. She didn\u2019t have the decency to tell you she felt it was best to cut ties or even to take a break. \n\nStill Tammy has every right to not want to have you in the bridal party under the boundaries you set. It is her wedding and her choice. She\u2019s not an AH because she made the decision not to accommodate or accept your boundaries because it will cause her undue stress. Not to mention it does cause her extra inconvenience to have to babysit Nick and his whereabouts to keep him away from you. It\u2019s understandable why she\u2019d find this difficult and frustrating.  She\u2019s right that she cannot and should not be controlling Shane or telling him who he can be friends with or who he can have as his groomsmen.

While I had friends who remained friends with us both, they never expected me to go near him again.  Aside from simply wanting to keep those friends, part of why I was comfortable with them hanging out with him was that they would give me a heads-up on when we might cross paths, and help keep him away from me.  None of them would have expected me to be in the same room as him, nevermind be in a wedding party with him.  Also, as they matured over the years, they dropped him as a friend.\n\nWhen I found out what had happened to my friend, months after he had happened to her, I immediately warned the rest of my female friends.  I would never have brought him near any of us, at least partially because my own experiences have resulted in a more Scorched Earth policy.  At the time, my boyfriend was quite close to him, and tried to have an intervention about his behavior.  When that failed, he cut all ties with the guy, and we are all better off (I'm also better off without the boyfriend, but that's another can of worms).\n\nGood friends do not try to force you into a situation like this, or ghost you over setting reasonable boundaries.  Tammy is treating this like a drama-llama highschool breakup, not an abusive asshole who wrecked your life and still clearly haunts you.  Some people can't or won't understand until it happens to them; and some people will also put their fancy marriage party, or their fiance's preference in awful friends, over the mental well-being of their loved ones.  I'm sorry, but right now you might be better off without this friendship.  If your therapist hasn't already suggested it, maybe make a pros and cons list of this friendship, one for back then and one for now.  This may be wedding fog, this may be pressure from her own fiance, but please don't let her convince you that you are the asshole for protecting yourself.  Do not take her back as a friend until she apologizes for expecting you to be in the same wedding party as your abuser (potentially endangering you in the process), and then ghosting you for trying to compromise on your own damn well-being.

I never mentioned to her that I was anxious about seeing them, but she sat us at separate tables, made sure she introduced me to other friends of hers she knew I would get on with, and we all had a great time. These are not people who physically abused me, these are people who have been slightly mean to me in the past and who we agreed she will remain friends with and I will not. She thought about my comfort without me asking her to, while planning and executing her wedding. This is what best friends do.
