He coughed without covering his mouth and coughed all over. My sister (14F) and I told him to cover his mouth,  but he never did and my parents told us to stop harassing him. I was the main caretaker for both my siblings, with my parents just kind of going to work and coming home. I have very sensitive tonsils, so anytime I get any sort of throat infection, they get inflamed and I get tonsilitis secondary to whatever throat infection I have at the time. I was trying to take care of my siblings while still sick. My tonsils were the size of ping pong balls, touching in the back of my throat, and oozing pus. I couldn't swallow, I was having some mild difficulty breathing, my fever was 104\u00b0F (\\~40\u00b0C), and I sweat through my clothes while still freezing. I was like that for 4 days on the couch, begging my parents to take me to at least Urgent Care (we lived right down the road and had excellent health insurance that they accepted). They refused and even accused me of faking. 4 days later, I managed to get my tonsilitis under control enough to be able to breathe comfortably and swallow (though it was excruciating), so to get up and take care of my sick siblings/do some chores that began piling up. I had lost 5lbs in 4 days from the toll the fever took on my body and I was still weak, but at least I wouldn't get in trouble for letting dishes sit in the sink. 2 weeks after the first onset of symptoms, I was better.\n\nA month ago:Our dad called me and had my brother explain his symptoms to me (I'm a nurse), saying he was trying to fake being sick. I said it sounds like the start of the flu and he even looked flushed/feverish. He got mad at me and accused my brother of lying again. I told him he needs to believe him and brought up the story I wrote out above. Instant karma must have been on my brother's side that day, because I heard him projectile vomit on our dad. I said, \"he seems pretty sick to me.\", told my brother I love him and to feel better soon, and hung up.Our dad texted me later, saying I shouldn't have brought it up in front of my brother because it would undermine his authority to send him to school if he wasn't really sick. I told him that clearly my brother is sick, and my story to now proves he hasn't learned from his mistake. He's still mad at me and keeps making passive agressive posts on facebook about disrespectful/disobedient kids. \n\nIt's been a month and now our family is in on it, telling me that I should respect and obey my parents; and now he has no authority with my brother because of me. I just ignore them right now, but I'm really starting to wonder if I'm in the wrong.So....
