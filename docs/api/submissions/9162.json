She ignored my pleas, and forced fed me grilled cheese on the couch while she talked on the phone to someone. I ended up throwing up all over me, her, the phone, and the couch. We literally had to get a new phone because it stopped working afterwards.\n\nShe never forced me to eat if I said I wasn't hungry ever again.

When I was little, my dad regularly tried to force me to eat adult portions, and one night he got real bad about it. Just a mountain of spaghetti. I told him I was cool and wasn't feeling good, but he forced me to eat the whole thing. The result? My room looked like someone tried to recreate The Exorcist with a family size pot of noodles. Guess who not only had to clean all that up but also never made me over eat again? \ud83d\ude08 If it works, it works.", "NTA\n\nHonestly the fact that it was intentional does kinda suck (though I needed that laugh), however she kinda deserved it. I also had a mom that made me finish everything on my plate before I could leave the table (so i just fell asleep at the tablle til she gave up). I have always had a small appetite like you and when you eat too much you want to hurl.  So maybe explain this too her again (with the memory fresh in her mind) and let her know you want little portions of things so you can enjoy without feeling sick. Good Luck!", "NTA.  They were forcing you to eat more than you physically could.  That is abuse.  Puking on your mom is way better than puking all over the table (I've puked all over the table, when forced to eat stewed tomatoes).  I told my mom they would make me puke, but she didn't believe me, so I took one bite, and it hit the back of my throat and all the other food I had just eaten was all over the table).    Mom never even made stewed tomatoes again in my presence.

Can\u2019t believe all the seYTA comments. You told her you couldn\u2019t eat anymore. Your mom kept pressuring you to eat. You said you felt sick and she said to keep eating.

Its her fault, she should have to deal with the consequences.", "Kind of tough I've been puked on by my adult boyfriend once but it was an accident. However my mom had tonworry if inwas gonna stop eating because even though I was small i could eat. I've never seen a mom force feed her child to the point of nausea. Hmm alot of these comments saying Y-T-A or E-S-H probably didn't have a parent rule their lives this way. I wonder what other thing contribute to a possible controlling environment.

Anyone forcing you to ignore your body's messages is abusing you and deserving what they get . Your mother values some vague notion of honoring family gluttony above her daughter's well-being.", "NTA, I like all te people here being all like OMG, u shuda lieeke saayyyyy something!!! Did the story not say they said so twice. Like wow. Words literally did nothing for OP so the retaliated in a manner that was enough to make the parents listen, kinda.

Bet she never tells you to keep eating again though..", "I mean if you didn't do it on purpose it'd be gross but not malicious but puking on someone to get back at them on purpose instead of just refusing to eat is ridiculous and concerning behavior.", "NTA.

She brought this on herself.", "How old are you?", "[deleted]", "YTA- no excuse to intentionally vomit on anyone\u2026 grow up! Have a voice and say no more food please!", "YTA. Don't throw up on people on purpose buddy that's super gross.", "YTA for intentionally throwing up on your mom rather than just saying no. You know your body\u2019s limits and you need to communicate that rather than taking revenge on your mom with vomit. That\u2019s beyond disgusting.", "ESH, you didn't need to aim your vomit at someone but they also shouldn't be pressuring you to over eat.", "YTA - For intentionally throwing up on mom, but not for throwing up.  Really, just throwing up on the floor would have been a sufficient statement.", "Esh but you moreso than them.  You never ever throw up on someone on purpose. Disgusting.", "YTA massively without question.\n\nYou deliberately vomit on someone and no other judgment is possible.", "ESH, I can understand that it's annoying as hell when family members force you to eat more but personally I don't think you should have vomited on your mom. But then again why couldn't the other 20-30 people there finish the rest of the food themselves?? Sure, they might be full as well but that isn't your priority.", "ESH, but yours is a much more sympathetic sucking. While your response was a little much, your mother was definitely in the wrong for forcing you to eat against your protests. It's near universally a shitty thing to do to bully someone into eating more than they want to or are comfortable with, and is made worse when the person doing the bullying is doing so from a position of parental authority.\n\nIntentionally aiming the vomit at your mother was taking things too far, but at your age occasionally acting like an AH and taking things too far and learning from it is just part of life. I can definitely understand the temptation to make the results of her choices *her* problem more than yours, but you could have accomplished that just as easily by calling her out and embarrassing her in front of everyone at the party.", "YTA. \n\nYeah, your parents suck for encouraging you to eat more, but it\u2019s up to you to put your foot down and make better choices for yourself. \n\nIf you wanted to visualize the effects of overeating you could have done so without vomiting on your mom. That\u2019s just an awful mess for everyone (you, your mom, your hosts).", "NTA your mom reaped what she sowed!", "YTA because you chose to vomit on your mother, you could\u2019ve avoided being sick ON her", "Whut?

That being said, while I am twisted enough to enjoy going nuclear at times I have a very sympathetic stomach so is my kid who is 20 now but at 15 had done that to me she would have had to sleep with one eye open for years\u2026.years. I barely survived her childhood when she was sick so we are talking airhorns for alarms, shutting off hot water when in shower, glitter bombs on dates everything.

Vomiting on someone to prove a point is most definitely an asshole move and if you can't see that your parents have failed you.", "Also Queen rules!", "I'll be perfectly honest, OP's mom most likely would've stopped forcing them to eat more if OP vomited somewhere else (not on someone else).", "So being  nauseous automatically means you will puke no matter what? I call BS as I have get really nauseous in the mornings like can't thi k can't eat can't move, but I only throw up 1 of 10 times. So to be fair no they probably wasn't going to puke till eating more. Did they have too, no. But with the moms initial reaction I believe she is always blowing OP off and never listens to them. There for chances are this is the only way to show them how they feel. Because I wouldn't doubt for a second that the parents would be almost as upset about them refusing to eat a relatives dish.they would have been told how rude it is to not eat something. If this was a stranger they puked on it would be disgusting but it was there overbearing mom.", "OP must be like 6 years old", "Lol, really. The said they couldn't eat any more. I failed English twice, but you take the cake for reading.", "Agreed. She did speak up. She was ignored, and she had to vomit. I hardly think she is TA simply for choosing to aim her vomit at the very cause of her nausea \ud83e\udd37", "We'll have to agree to disagree on how this sort of dynamic works. To me, this feels a lot like blaming any victim that was *physically* forced but was forced through manipulation, gaslighting, guilt-tripping, or taking advantage of power balance in a relationship. To me, this is the latter; parents are in a position of authority of minor children, and when they force stuff like this, they are essentially taking advantage of that dynamic, throwing their weight around. For a lot of kids, obeying is the norm, and it is hard and scary for them to break free of that, even when their parents are making unreasonable demands.", "I think parents should know better than to force their kid to eat. Thank god Op didn\u2019t puke all over the rest of the food and instead on their ass mom", "Op didn\u2019t barf on her mom because her mom took away her phone privileges. Her mother, someone with power over her, was forcing her to eat despite repeated pleas of being sick. She used a weapon to fend off someone who was harming her. That weapon was vomit.", "All I'm saying is the parents would've still gotten the message if OP just threw up on the floor instead of being mad gross", "That makes total sense, I didn\u2019t think of it like that. I don\u2019t have a hard time standing up for myself to my mom. Does OP say how old she/ he is? I envisioned them as an adult when I read this.", "OP is 15", "Yeah, neither do I, but I've seen some of my peers with very controlling, strict parents struggle with this even into adulthood. It's the sort of dynamic that often leads to kids going LC or NC later on."]}
