Nobody really asked for an update, but I wanted to offer one for those who helped me originally. \n\n[OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15blqfw/aita_for_asking_my_mom_to_make_me_dinner/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)\n\nEverything kinda ended in a blow out fight. Both my mom and I were yelling at each other and I tried to practice driving despite my foot, and let\u2019s just say there was a lot of crying on my end. I barely got out the driveway. \n\nWhen I came back into the house I barricaded myself in my room and tried to calm down. Maybe an hour or so later, my mom came upstairs much calmer than before. She apologized saying she\u2019s used to having to push people to go above and beyond and thought I was \u2018making it worse than it was for sympathy\u2019 but later said she misspoke. \n\nI plan to study abroad and she kept saying that if I were on my study abroad, i wouldn\u2019t be able to ask for help and she was trying to help me get in that mindset. I listened to what you guys said about being a mature adult is asking for help when you need it and said this. She apologized again.\n\nI ended up showing her the post. She spent a long time reading it. I explained that I felt that no matter how hard I tried I was never able to be enough for her. That I\u2019d reach her goal and she\u2019d make a new one further down a road. And that yes, I\u2019m legally an adult, but for all intents and purposes I\u2019m just a kid. I have a disorder that puts my mental development 2 years behind my peers + covid during my school has really set me back. \n\nShe said she really is proud of me and she recognizes that she pushes me more than she needs to. She wants me to come to her for help, and she\u2019s really struggling with letting my sister and I grow up.  I told her that I can still grow up and need help from my mom once in a while. \n\nI love my mom dearly. She\u2019s done her best despite some unlucky odds, and I think (though I may be biased) that she\u2019s raised me well. \n\nShe made me dinner that night, too, and gave me a hug. \n\nThank you guys for helping me organize my thoughts so I could properly explain how I felt.", "created_utc": 1691251744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15izkf1/update_aita_for_asking_my_mom_to_make_me_dinner/", "score": 273, "replies": ["Even though I haven\u2019t replied to the original post, I\u2018m so happy the replies of others helped you and especially your mom to understand your point and feelings.", "You said parents in one of your responses. Where was your other parent while this was unfolding?", "This reminds me of Netflix's The Good Bad Mother (Korean drama).  First few episodes are brutal but warm....", "You\u2019re very brave", "I'm glad she apologized. No, she wasn't obligated to make you anything when you asked, but it was an AH move of her to refuse, and I'm glad that she recognized that. I'm sorry it took a fight to make this conversation happen, but it sounds like it was one you guys have been needing to have for a while. It's great that you guys were able to understand each other better by the end of it.", "I\u2019m sitting here with a broken foot and my kids are being more helpful than your mom was. Bah!\n\nI get where your mom is coming from. Learning to push past adversity IS an important skill. But evaluating what is pushing past reasonable adversity and what is pushing into pathological independence is not healthy. \n\nHumans have evolved to have some inter-dependence on each other. A famous archeologist marks the beginning of civilization in areas by when the first healed femur fracture can be found in the fossil record, because it shows humans caring for another human who cannot (for a time) care for themselves.\n\nLearning how to support ourselves AND ask for support (and take that support) is a life long practice to learn, but it\u2019s important, and I hope that she can learn that. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s learned enough to apologize to you and discuss with you.", "Just saw this sorry -\n\nI was really scared making the OP. I was kinda convinced it\u2019d be a resounding YTA and I\u2019d get bashed on but there were a lot of really helpful things said. It was nice to get out of my head and have a third party kinda help me sort through my thoughts.", "Sleeping, haha.", "Oh I\u2019ve heard of that (I think). Would say I\u2019d check it out but now I\u2019m nervous it\u2019ll unearth some feelings lol", "My moms amazing in many, many ways. She\u2019s just afraid that my sister and I will enter the world and be unprepared for the adversity she\u2019s tried to shield us from as children. Do I agree with her sudden 180? Not really. Do I get where she\u2019s coming from? Yeah. \n\nBut she DID have one point. I did end up making dinner that night, and I was a bit proud of myself. I still don\u2019t think I should\u2019ve HAD to, but I know that I CAN. \n\nThere\u2019s also I can\u2019t like accurately portray the complexity of my relationship with my mom in a single Reddit post, lol. Im not sure why im typing this all out in response to this comment but it just happened lol. \n\n(Also - the femur thing always makes me tear up. Humans are much more intertwined and loving than we give ourselves credit for.)", "You sound very mature, and kind, and just a great person. I really hope your mother opens her eyes and treats you like the mature young adult that you are. \n\nI really like your phrase that you can grow up and still be allowed to need your mother. And that is so true.", "For future reference- if you wish for a meal to be available to you outside normal eating times. Just ask that a plate of food be set aside for you. Your mother is not a mind reader. If your injury is causing your sleep cycle to overlap their waking hours be preemptive in asking in advance instead of when you wake up and they\u2019re going to bed. By chance is it your mom driving you to all your dr appts?", "Oh only first few episodes focus on son's feelings and mother's ways.  Later episodes are not related to you and your mom incident.  Nothing serious. ;P", "Thank you! I try my hardest to be kind because when I was at my worst moments, I never forgot the small kindnesses I received. \n\nWith my mom it\u2019s kinda complicated. It\u2019s like part of her wants me to be her little baby forever, and another part of her wants me to be an adult who won\u2019t need her. But the fact of the matter is I\u2019m neither of those things - I am young, struggling with things normal at my age, and doing my best. I have been unlucky with certain things in my life which have slowed me down significantly, but I\u2019m nowhere near the point she\u2019s afraid I\u2019m at. Or, I think so, at least. Maybe I\u2019ll look back in 5 years and be like \u2018wow I was being dumb, lol\u2019", "Oop sorry just saw this lol.\n\nI\u2019m off crutches now and before we knew what it was, I forced myself to drive. She drove me to one appt, and then after the fight took me to a club event. I also got a Partial ride back from said event to not put her out.", "I\u2019ve got some friends super into K-Dramas it might be fun to hang out and watch it together then :) TYSM for the recommendation!!", "If you were on study abroad you wouldn't be able to ask for help - wtf?\n\nWhen I was on study abroad, I got a text late at night from someone in my program saying she'd broken her ankle and was at the ER. So I got on the metro and went over and kept her company and helped her go get her crutches, and a few days later I went grocery shopping for her. And we weren't even really friends, but we were part of the same little study abroad community and she'd had a crappy thing happen to her and obviously I was going to try to help. You're not completely isolated just because you're in another country; you've got people around, and if they're not complete AHs like OP's mom, they'll help out.", "Even some animal species help each other :) cooperation is very important to many forms of life.\n\nOfc if she completely sheltered you before that wasn't helpful either. But it would be good for her to realise doing a 180 is equally as damaging to you. A healthy balance is key. And if she isn't sure which is which in a given situation - you guys can just openly communicate about it! It would be fine for her to e.g. say \"I am afraid of coddling you too much so that you're unable to cope if you are injured and alone\" and then perhaps you could compromise by e.g. her saying \"tell me what you would do if I was not there\" and discuss what you come up with and ALSO her help you in this instance as another commenter correctly identified that asking for help in appropriate situations IS a valuable life skill.", "I'm nearly 30 and I've been lucky that nothing has really held me back. \n\nTechnically I am completely self sufficient. But I still ask my parents for help. And sometimes they ask me for help. I feel like practically I don't necessarily NEED need them but so often it is so nice that they are there to help. And if I ever thought of them dying then I think nooo they cant, I need them. But I guess just as in I want them in my life forever.\n\nIdk what this ramble meant, maybe just that it's not bad to ask for help. Its not bad not to need your parents and its not bad TO need your parents. \n\nAnd your mum was weird. If someone is injured and you could easily help, and they ask politely you 100% help them - it has nothing to do with being an adult. It's not like if she helped you when injured you'd magically not be able to make your own dinner when healed. And sure with much difficulty and risk you could've done it yourself but what on earth does that teach? Struggle without my help in case you don't have my help and you need to struggle? \n\nAnyway, I am glad she apologised. Parents are only people, who of course are flawed.\n\nIt sounds like you are a kind person, which is the best sort of person. I like you and I wish you the best", "If you ever feel like something on family dynamics & communication (& various other struggles of life) I always recommend This Is Us. Its also very wholesome.\n\nIt helped my fiance confront feelings he'd kept shut away for decades and learn how to talk to his parents. I'm sure much won't be relevant to you but it's still a lovely show.", ">She wants me to come to her for help, and she\u2019s really struggling with letting my sister and I grow up.\n\nShe said all this but passed on an opportunity to fill you up with warm soups and baby you while injured. I'd be side-eyeing her. Sounds like a load of bull to me.", "Thanks for the update. I think your mum was being unreasonable. But pretty much everyone has had an unreasonable moment some times in their lives. You're NTA. She's NTA either if this is out of character. For me he apology redeems her considerably. \nI think you could have also been more understanding of your mums needs. If you knew she was going to be up early it would have been far better if you had of asked earlier in the evening.", "OP clarified that their mom is currently struggling to find a balance between babying her kids and pushing them too hard towards independence. So it\u2019s not really shocking that she\u2019s over-compensating for her lingering impulse to coddle by completely withdrawing all assistance, no matter how much it\u2019s legitimately needed. She hasn\u2019t yet figured out how to split the difference.", "I don't get the down votes for your post, it was a good suggestion", "When I was on study abroad, I got stranded traveling in a nearby country because of a natural disaster. The only reason it didn't ruin the entire trip or go dangerously bad was because people helped me--this was pre-smartphones, and multiple friends and acquaintances helped me plan and book a new route to get where I needed to go. The only part of the trip that got dire vs just uncomfortable and costly was when the family member I urgently asked to help me figure out one leg decided they had better things to do. A few years later, I was subletting abroad and locked myself and a friend out of my apartment, and we only weren't totally screwed because my sublettor's neighbors and friends (she was on vacation in another country) jumped in to help. Humans are social creatures and interdependent.", "MA! THE MEAT LOAF!", "That\u2019s fair. I hadn\u2019t really mentioned in the OP that I\u2019d been sleeping the whole day and to my family \u2018up early\u2019 tends to mean something like 1pm. This wasn\u2019t the case that day, but I hadn\u2019t known that at the time, if I had I never would\u2019ve asked to begin with.", "You should feel proud of yourself for making your needs and perspective heard in this way while still being sensitive to your mum\u2019s circumstances. You were kind but stood firm and that\u2019s a tough thing to do. I\u2019m well into my 30s and only managing to learn this now!\n\nNice one OP, this way of communicating is going to serve you well in the future so keep at it!", "OP, I went on a research trip to England and Wales for my dissertation to just a couple of months ago; this was the first time I'd ever left the southern US. I had never used public transit before, my phone refused to work at all, and I took forever trying to count out money. And people were so kind. I ended up stranded in a village in Wales and sat at the bus stop without a bus coming for over an hour and a half. I walked into the local pub, and an entire room of people explained to me that the posted schedule was wrong and told me exactly when the next bus would come and how to flag it down. When I didn't understand how to use the London tube, people explained it to me. Sometimes, people even told me, 'hey, don't travel that way; this way will save you so much money.' I had someone look at my hand and very gently say, 'you're going to have to card this purchase; you don't have enough,' while I was just staring at these coins in my hand and trying to read them. And I'm 30!\n\nIt's okay to ask help, and if you are going to learn anything from this experience, it should be that. My experience is that people were generally happy to help me out--especially if I told them I was a student who came to study something in their country. And if you study abroad through a university, college, or other academic program, you will have people whose job it is to help you if you encounter issues! You'll make friends! It's true that you might not be able to always ask someone you know well for help, but that doesn't mean you're going to be abandoned with no one. \n\nI think this is more about your mother worrying about you being an adult and going off on your own; she worries that she won't be there to help you if you study abroad. And hopefully, she will come to realize that she has to let you be an adult, even if it means that you may make mistakes and have to figure out how to fix them. My parents went through this same thing; they were worried because I'm depressed and anxious and also had a very sheltered upbringing. And I turned out fine! So will you.", "This makes me feel a lot better. I don\u2019t know how to properly say what I\u2019m thinking as it\u2019s real early where I\u2019m at, but thank you."]}
