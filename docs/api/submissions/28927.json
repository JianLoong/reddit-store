He\u2019s a great husband overall, but his relationship with his mom and one particular cousin makes me so uncomfortable. \n\nCousin (27F) and him grew up together, were best friends since childhood, went through a horrible tragedy together etc. I took a glance at his phone screen a few days ago and saw his message to her that read \u201cdo you understand just how attractive you are?\u201d She sent him pictures of her \u201cbody transformation\u201d and he replied \u201cyou put on an insane amount of muscle\u201d. His type is muscular women with tattoos and piercings. I\u2019m a small woman with no muscles, one small tattoo and piercings on my ears and nostril, so basically not his type. This further added to the discomfort. I\u2019ve expressed to him previously how I don\u2019t like him making comments about other women\u2019s bodies and he took me seriously, but maybe he thinks his cousin is not included in that? \n\nHis mom is also a major factor behind this. She loves to talk about how she was a single mom raising him and she and him basically \u201cgrew up together\u201d. In my opinion, that\u2019s a bit strange. She also loves telling me how close they are and how they discuss everything under the sun. He and I have had discussions about this when I found out she had inquired about our sex life and he had divulged information regarding my birth control. I do not share this information with anyone, not even with my own mother. Moreover, MIL pries a lot. She is comfortable asking him anything and everything and he doesn\u2019t stop her. He made me very uncomfortable when he changed in front of his mom and walked around the house in underwear while she was there. All of this comes off as extremely emotionally incestuous to me. \n\nI talked to him about his mom and his lack of boundaries with her. He countered with \u201cno this is normal. It\u2019s probably just your upbringing and your relationship with your family that makes you feel this way\u201d. For context, I grew up in a small South Asian country in a Muslim household. I\u2019m very close to my parents, but I have pretty solid boundaries with them due to my upbringing. We were never the type to walk around in underwear in the house. My parents also do not pry and I have never thought of my cousins as \u201cattractive\u201d. He definitely did not like that I insinuated emotional incest and an inappropriate relationship between him and his mom. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019ve began to feel a form of disgust and resentment towards him. AITA here? If I am, what should my next steps be? Please help me.\n\nEdit - Answering some FAQs. \n\nCousin was okay at first but then started getting weird because she planned a trip to come visit us after her break up. It\u2019s clear she wanted it to be just him and her. He and I both proposed I tag along and she was absolutely not okay with that. So she canceled her trip. While on the phone discussing the trip, my husband did say some things that I consider inappropriate, such as \u201cdon\u2019t worry, bring a dress and I\u2019ll take you out to dinner somewhere nice\u201d. Now you might say that I\u2019m being daft, but to me, this is definitely not okay. Leaving your wife behind to go on a two week long trip with your cousin that just broke up and seeming all couply is extremely weird to me. \n\nThe birth control conversation was not like \u201chey when are y\u2019all having grand kids?\u201d And my husband simply replying \u201cshe\u2019s on birth control so not any time soon\u201d. She inquired about our sex life, wanted to know what kind of birth control we were using, my husband called her on our honeymoon several times because he wanted to show his mom everything etc. I feel on edge sharing anything with him because I feel like it will get back to my MIL. She wants to know a lot of personal information that I believe should be between husband and wife.", "created_utc": 1697312533, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177xbuq/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_his_relationship/", "score": 197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you do about them might be.  The assumption that your family dynamic is the correct one is erroneous at best.

Unfortunately, we lost him to a brain tumor & I miss him terribly. \nBeing close to your child doesn\u2019t make it ugly. \nYou should talk to him about what is or is not ok to share with her.

I wouldn't worry about that (unless they start wanting to hang out alone together). You have more of an issue with his relationship with his mother.

The reason it is this and not that there are no assholes is because you want him to change, to fall in with your ways and even refer to his relationship with his mother as incestuous because he walks around in his underpants. Which is ludicrous. \n\nHis cousin is more like his sister in closeness, he is building her up and trying to increase her self confined e by the sound of it.  He has a strong, open relationship with his mum - it\u2019s great he can talk to her openly esp about stuff like birth control. \n\nYou had the option not to talk to her about those things, but did and now want him to restrict his relationships rather than working on your boundaries. \n\nStop making him out to be the weird one and go to couples counselling. You need some help. It is entirely unfair to expect him to pander to your inhibitions and moralistic views.\n\nActually after re-reading your post and the last couple of lines, you should break up.

Is that less weird because they\u2019re both female? \n\nIf his mom was young when she had him then they did grow up together.

It seems like your husband has a really amazing relationship with his mother and she did a hell of a job raising him to talk this openly with her about sensitive topics. You should appreciate it rather than dislike it. \n\nFairly saying though that it\u2019s fine for you to tell him not to discuss your very personal issues with her, if it makes you feel uncomfortable. \n\nAbout the cousin\u2026 honestly, he just seems really close to his family.

His comment to his cousin may seem weird to you but it\u2019s probably him just being super supportive. They\u2019re close and have a bond.

It's quite irrelevant that you happen to be from an Asian country Muslim household. you could hail from any country or religion and what he's doing would still be disrespectful towards you.   I can see there's a potential 1 in a million chance of a type of 'sisterhood' with the cousin. The issues between him and your mother in law, however are 100% indefensible. I  completely understand your disgust over such  highly inappropriate behaviors. OP, it concerns me that he is so completely uncaring of your feelings. Has she been pressuring him to make grandchildren by chance? Even if she has been that doesn't excuse her behavior. He sounds quite immature.", "YTA. You have described a perfectly normal family dynamic. Yes, plenty of families are comfortable around each other in their under clothes. It's not incestuous. There is no sexual element. It is just family. \nThe only wrong thing here is your husband sharing personal information that you did not want shared.

I've had a friend who in their family it was normal - I found it really uncomfortable then too (and to be honest, her mother had huge boundary issues, so I don't know what to make of that). I think, just like it may feel bizarre but that's normal for some families and it's not actually an indication of anything incestuous, if it happened in my family, it would feel kind of incestuous. Basically, I feel like neither of you are wrong, as others have said, but I wanted to be at least one voice saying it who identifies primarily with your side.\n\nThat said, you're definitely still right to want privacy, and it's fair to ask for the two of you to establish boundaries between what you keep between yourselves as a couple and what sort of information it's appropriate to share with extended family such as his mother. It's not healthy in the long term for him to have no filter on what he shares with her. It makes sense that he didn't think about it this time cause it sounds like you hadn't really had some explicit conversations about it, but at least you two can be intentional about it now.\n\nGood luck. :)", "That\u2019s cultural.

It\u2019s fine to have a close relationship with your mom. There\u2019s a point where it can become too close, however. It crosses a boundary when either party\u2019s sex lives are discussed. The fact that he told her about your birth control was a major overstep that falls under that category. \n\nThe stuff with his cousin is weird. I have a ton of cousins (29 first cousins on my mom\u2019s side alone) and I grew up with two in particular.

These behaviors are most likely not sexualized in any way for him. Further, I am extremely close with my daughter because she is my only child. We tell each other pretty much everything now that she's 21. We're best friends. Again, this is just a familial difference that is not shared by either of our spouses. \n\nYou need to just talk through these differences with him so you can better understand each other's familial past. Best to do this before you have any children, so you're on the same page for your shared family.\n\nEdit: grammar", "I mean it\u2019s really not strange.

I'll be honest - we eventually broke up over it. \n\nYou were brought up differently true, but your body is your body. If he is sharing personal information that you did not consent to, he is crossing major boundaries. If he cannot see that, I do not see how the relationship can grow.\n\nEdit: I see in the comments that he did eventually come around but there needs to be a major conversation about this.

My parents would never ask about my sex life, that is a private matter and that boundary is respected. My MIL made a remark about mine and my husband's sex life and it was really uncomfortable, my husband and his sister bold told her she was being weird. \nI would expect that he knows how you were raised and he should respect you by asking, is it OK for me to talk about xyz personal thing with my mother.\nThe comment about his cousin makes me a little creeped out. There are different ways to compliment family vs other people.

Attractive is pretty tame. He could be trying to be nice and boost her confidence. I have attractive people in my family. But I don't find them sexy or hot. Finding someone attractive isn't an issue.\n\nIt sounds like you need to sit down and have a heart to heart. Don't attack, just be calm but firm. It might help if you used an example with him.

What you are describing doesn\u2019t scream red flags or weird to me, nor does it sound particularly intrusive (in this isolated instance, there may be others that are,). By your own admission you grew up in a very conservative environment, for me, sex, nudity, etc were all normal discussions. \n\nOne of my favorite family debates was at Christmas with my grandparents discussing if you had two penises (or your partner did) what would be the preferred configuration? (I brought it up and was the youngest in attendance as a 22 year old). It was a hilarious discussion, with no embarrassment or shame. Day after I lost my virginity to my ex, it was a breakfast table discussion with my mum as though talking about the weather. I didn\u2019t feel forced to have that discussion, we just have a very open and trusting relationship and it was completely my choice. \n\nI know my upbringing is different to most, but it is not uncommon for only children and single parents to have a relationship where it\u2019s not strictly parent/child. My mum and I range from parent/child to financial partners, to friends and sibling style depending on the setting. As a result boundaries are a little blurry. They exist, but only if it\u2019s made known. If the other party doesn\u2019t say anything or object then it\u2019s assumed all is fine.\n\nKnowing your partner has this relationship with his mum you need to make it known to him at the time if something is just between you. If no topics have ever been off limit with his mum before, he\u2019s not going to think or assume they are for you until you\u2019ve effectively trained him that your boundaries are different to his. \n\nIf he\u2019s respectful of your boundaries when you make them known, then there is no problem. If his mother tries to get him to talk about things after he\u2019s said no, then there is a problem, and again, that might just be a case of her needing to learn that you have different boundaries than her son. As long as she is trying to be respectful of your boundaries, you\u2019re okay. The other factor for me is motivation. If she wants to know because she genuinely cares or worries about you that to me is different than just being nosy looking for gossip/ammunition to use against you.\n\nFinally cousin, look it\u2019s odd, but I have a cousin I talk to/about like that. Purely platonic and just close. More like friends than being defined as relatives, but the odds of there being anything more than just playful/friendly banter is incredibly slim. Don\u2019t get me wrong, my cousin is hot as hell objectively, and he knows it, but even though he\u2019s not a first cousin the thought of actually doing anything with him is seriously gross. \n\nNAH.

They have a only parent only child relationship - that is a very different parent/child relationship and it does come with more flexible boundaries and expectations. Through our his childhood he would have taken on discussions and decisions in a adult partner role (not romantically speaking) to her for example in discussing planning, organizing, finances etc. as a result these topics are naturally more fluid with single parent/only child pairs. \n\nTherapy is also a good idea for your partner and yourself. You have a difference in boundaries and what you both consider normal and appropriate. For what it\u2019s worth, I naturally started pulling back from my mum over time (my partner filled role of sounding board for planning/organizing and financial discussions I would share with her and she got a partner who did the same for her), but it did take therapy to see that the relationship we had, while not toxic, wasn\u2019t the healthiest either based on the developed co-dependence we shared based on the nature of my upbringing. My mum is amazing, loves my partner to the ends of the earth, and yes early on, sometimes we accidentally crossed his boundaries. But it\u2019s something we are conscious of and work on to ensure doesn\u2019t happen again. That said, over the years he\u2019s actually transitioned to our side and has a closer relationship with my mum than his own, and really enjoys the closeness and trust of being able to be completely honest and transparent about what/how he\u2019s feeling. But this comes from him being able to trust my mum and was completely his choice.", "My cousin, who is 12 years  older than  me, said virtually these exact words to me.\n\nThere was no flirtation. \n\nI was going thru a body transformation and hated myself, even though I was healthier, I couldn't see that I looked better. I could never \"objectively\" look at myself in a mirror (still can't tbh).\n\nMy cousin simply told me that I didn't know how attractive I was. No ulterior motive than attempting to help me when I was struggling and in a difficult place", "To me it is. Calling someone attractive isn't the same as saying \"I wanna fuck you,\" and to me it's weird that people are sexualizing this.", "Yes,...why wouldnt it be? You tell they are smart, too...\n\nWhy is that weird to you?", "If you're Charles Darwin or Alois Hitler yes absolutely. \ud83d\ude05", "Maybe!", "YTA. So he wanted to go on a trip with a family member and you wanted to isolate him from that? This is not emotional incest (not a thing) it\u2019s you being controlling and insecure.", "It might be good to dig into why you feel uncomfortable and if you want to change that feeling? It sounds like you\u2019re happy staying uncomfortable and feel very justified in that feeling\u2026Which doesn\u2019t really lend itself well to compromise (a very important aspect of any relationship).", ">But divulging my private health information is a lot more than just slightly wrong. It\u2019s a massive violation of privacy. \n\nIt's not though. It's very minor that he shared that information. It is absolutely relevant to him too and not an uncommon thing to discuss with his family what your birth control situation is as a couple/unit. We are constantly trying to get men to have more of a presence of mind and stake in birth control, don't vilify him for actually being actively aware of what you two are using! It's a minor thing because it's not just your personal health information, he had no reason to presume he couldn't share it without you expressing that. It's fine for you to want that private, it's not okay to treat him like he's betrayed you because he is closer to his family than you are to yours.", "Your repulsion is pretty unquestionably extreme. Don\u2019t deny that part. It\u2019s crazy weird that you\u2019re mine goes to incest just because you came from a more uptight family.\n\nAlso, what was the extent of the birth control conversion. \u201cAre you two planning for kids?\u201d \u201cNah, she\u2019s on birth control until we\u2019re ready\u201d for instance is a perfectly normal conversation.", "you are quite controlling and insecure. Honestly he doesnt need permission to talk to his mother about anything. That woman gave him his life and raised him. They have a strong and unique bond, maybe even stronger than yours, which makes you insecure.\n\nInstead of celebrating that, you call it incestuous, which is insulting. not to him, but to you. You reduce a mother-son relationship to incest?!?! because he talked to his mother and walked around the house in underwear.\n\nYou need therapy. Honestly, you sound like an entitled self-obsessed bitch.", "Not a thing for you, doesn't mean not a thing for everyone.", "well, just because you are distant with your own family, it doesnt mean others are like that.", "The other day I said to someone \u201cGod you are a sexy man, I could just cover you in whipped cream and lick every ounce of it off of you\u201d. \n\nIn the context of the conversation, literally no person in the group considered it to be flirtatious. Not even my partner. Context is everything and we simply don\u2019t have it", "Is her prying coming from a place of genuine interest, love, and concern for you, or is it something you feel she weaponize s or uses against you? The situation changes how you handle it.\n\nIf she\u2019s coming from a place of genuine love, she\u2019s likely to feel bad about breaching your boundaries and isn\u2019t actively trying to do so. A gentle reminder that you understand she has a very close relationship with her son, but that you grew up very differently, and aren\u2019t comfortable with these sorts of questions, and requesting that she respect when you withhold information or don\u2019t answer certain questions to not pry further should be enough. It might take some reminding, but if she\u2019s genuine you should notice a very quick change and only the occasional slip up. \n\nIf it\u2019s intentional and malicious. That is where it gets really sticky and you have to grey rock her. It\u2019s also where you have to get your partner on board for doing the same. It will probably involve therapy on his part. \n\nThat said, couples therapy is probably a good idea to help you and your partner navigate a happy medium of expectation and compromise. Your wants and expectations with regards to what he discusses with his mum is not absolute - you grew up differently so have different expectations. You both have to be willing to compromise otherwise it will foster bitterness in your relationship. If you as a couple can\u2019t agree on a compromise, the painful reality is that your social expectations as a couple aren\u2019t compatible. Either you are going to feel he\u2019s overly involving his Mum, or he will feel like you are excessively excluding her. If/ when kids enter the picture it\u2019s just going to get worse.", "It\u2019s fairly normal for a mom to ask her kid if they\u2019re practicing safe sex. It doesn\u2019t make her son an asshole to say \u201cwe\u2019ve been tested and she\u2019s on the pill.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what happened, we didn\u2019t get enough details. My point is, unless she\u2019s previously told him not to share that info, it doesn\u2019t make him an asshole to say that. Yes, he should apologize, but we don\u2019t know if he did or didn\u2019t. So I can\u2019t definitively call him an asshole.", "No. This is sim0ly not appropriate adult behavior.", "I have a relationship with my family like this. I always could talk to my mom and my sister and cousins and aunts about super intimate stuff and it was just normal. We tell each other everything and it would never occur to me not to talk about birth control or sex. I would and definitely have told my cousins how attractive they are (we like to soup each other up)", "This was such a nice way to say this!! I love it!", "My family is totally comfortable with nudity. Even to this day when I\u2019m visiting my mum unless her partner (who came into the picture after I was an adult) is around I\u2019ll happily start eating breakfast around her in the buff. Hot day? If she\u2019s visiting and my partners at work she\u2019ll strip her bra off or ask me to get him to call before he comes home so she can be in her undies. \n\nMy grandfather- bless him, was very much of the opinion his house his rules, if he wanted to be naked no one had to look. If guests arrived early they knew full well he wasn\u2019t going to change how he got ready because they were there early, and were likely going to cop an eyeful. My poor grandmother had to practically dive her dad with a towel when he started stripping at the beach one visit because \u201cthey don\u2019t do that here!\u201d Followed by him complaining about getting sand stuck in his undies. \n\nBut we know we live in a country where it\u2019s not the norm and we aren\u2019t going to inflict it on those around us unless they expressly state they don\u2019t mind and are okay with it. My friends all know it isn\u2019t anything sexual, exhibitionist or voyeuristic, just a comfort and culturally normal thing for us. \n\nTo me it\u2019s weird that my best friend had never seen a man naked till she got with her partner despite having 2 brothers and her father living in the same house and had no point of reference beyond biology books. The fact that many of my friends didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking to their own mothers about sex and straight up asked to talk to mine was mind boggling. I can\u2019t imagine not being comfortable taking to any of my relatives- including my grandparents- about sex. I\u2019m really worried that in living here my kids might develop this idea that parents aren\u2019t approachable to talk to about those sorts of topics.", "It's his MOTHER! She's seen everything there is to see, actually she created it! It's not gross to walk around like that. Now if he was naked I would say, ok that's a bit far. \nIf you feel grossed out by all this, it's time to split. Don't change his relationship with his family if you are going to leave. If his family treats you right and it's a loving environment then let that be.", "I\u2019m with op on this one.   I would walk by my mother no problem in my underwear in her house, or on vacation or something.   And I walk around in my own house with my wife in my underwear all the time.   But if my mom was staying with us, I would put on pants because I think it would be weird for my wife otherwise!   It\u2019s like our thing in our house.", "Are you a man? It\u2019s prescription medication that changes your hormones and comes with a myriad of serious side effects at the very least and at the most it\u2019s an (often very painful) invasive procedure involving putting a foreign object up her vagina, through her cervix, and into her uterus. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to mention to your parents that you use protection/ aren\u2019t trying to have children at the moment if it comes up, but it\u2019s absolutely OPs private health information that is weird to talk about with someone.", "You sound like a child. State your opinion if you can be polite.", "Are you attracted to men?", "I have yet for my bf to say this stuff in front of his mom with me around \ud83d\ude2d This has not been a norm for me at all, this has always been a conversation between the child & parents without me involved in my cultures. To some people it can be seen as rather absurd", "Huh?\n\nSeeing an adult male in his undies? Is terrible. Hahahah\n\nDon\u2019t go to a beach or pool!", "That\u2019s an opinion not a fact. Frankly the only thing that I\u2019ve seen her write that struck me as remotely inappropriate was her reading his messages. \n\nTelling someone they are attractive, particularly a relative, does not automatically mean they want to jump the other parties bones. Out of context maybe her husband has been having some self esteem issues lately and she\u2019s trying to help him build some confidence? Maybe cousin had a seriously shit date and is appreciating how great her cousin is as a person? There are any number of platonic and innocent reasons a relative might tell another that they\u2019re attractive. \n\nAnd it is completely normal for different people to have different boundaries. There is nothing described as malicious on MILs part, and sharing that OP is on birth control could have simply played out as \u201cyou\u2019ve been married several years now and still no children - is everything okay?\u201d In the sense of legitimate concern \u201cno, everything is fine, we just aren\u2019t ready and using birth control.\u201d From there the discussion could very logically just turn into a discussion about birth control in general \u201cI hated birth control, made my hormones go ballistic\u201d \u201cyeah wife had issues with the pill and took xyz instead which worked much better,\u201d most discussions are very innocent and rarely intentional/consciously breach privacy or confidentiality. For most people the above conversation would be completely normal.", "If you\u2019re this insecure about your husband\u2019s cousins, you should probably talk to a therapist. Your husband\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t going to fix your self-esteem. Only you can do that.", "Thinking someone is attractive isn't the same as being attracted to someone. \n\nI know my brother is an attractive man. \n\nI am not attracted to him tho  \n\nThere is a difference. I can absolutely acknowledge that someone is handsome, pretty, attractive, etc but not have any attraction to them.", "Sounds like you have a lot of cousin fucking in your family and are afraid of crossing a line. You can literally tell anyone that they\u2019re attractive without it being weird.", "I hate this take \u2018she\u2019s seen everything there is to see\u2019. Yeah she saw them as a kid, not as an adult. Parents bathe with their kids but it would be very weird to bathe with them as adults. \nit doesn\u2019t mean I agree with OPs take - I just disagree with the first part of your reaction", "Nope I'm a woman, I've experienced all the pain and frustration that comes with birth control options currently available. I'm saying that op is convoluting the severity of this disclosure immensely. Yes it's ops private health information, and it is ALSO relevant for him. It's not like he's her doctor. It would not be a second thought of anyone in my circle to casually mention 'oh yes, she's on the pill' or something similar when having a conversation about life. Op doesn't give enough detail to make it seem like it's anything more than that as opposed to some elaborate disclosure about her health. She needs to stop acting like this was a major betrayal and simply an error in communication that can be easily healed if she wants this relationship to work.", "U ok ?", "I want to know the whole conversation before that sentence to understand the context. She could have been down on herself because someone made a comment about her body building and putting on muscle and he was counter acting the negative comment. By reminding her she is attractive. How much muscle did she put on. Some guys don\u2019t find overly muscular women attractive and some men aren\u2019t very tactful with comments.\n\nI have jack asses ding my confidence with their comments.", "Telling a cousin \" you don't realize how pretty you are\" or \"you've put on a lot of muscle\" is NOT flirting by any stretch of the imagination, I've similarly complimented my female cousins, in front of my wife, without negative reaction, but then we both grew up knowing our cousins weren't for dating. And being comfortable around your mother in your boxers isn't incestuous, any more than being close to her is emotional incest. If you grew up in a home that didn't emphasize shame of self, it's not uncommon in the least.\n\nOP obviously comes from an ultra conservative upbringing, one that would be seen as extreme in the minds of most.   And is making mountains out of molehills. \n\nOP, Grow up and quit looking for problems, enough real ones will crop up without you adding to them.", "Take out attractive and add funny, smart, badass or any other word and it isn\u2019t necessarily inappropriate. Make it the same genders for cousins and it isn\u2019t necessarily inappropriate. But commenting on someone\u2019s looks is inappropriate? I guess I just disagree as I think there are circumstances where family can be insecure and that kind of statement is more of a \u201cstop being a dumb ass, of course your gorgeous\u201d type statement as opposed to a \u201cI am into incest and flirting with you\u201d statement.", "What.\n\nI'll give you a protip. It's perfectly normal to compliment someone's looks, even family members, if they seem like they're having a moment of insecurity. Especially if it's in relation to fitness.\n\nStraight up, where do you live that incest is so common you have to worry your partner might try to fuck their cousin?", "See, that was flirting. Reign it in big boy.", "I'm sorry but I don't agree with you. But that's OK. LOL!!", "I agreed as well about you being his type. Regarding the family dynamics speak to him about it. Communication is key. He is just really close with his mom and his cousin. You two grew up differently that\u2019s all. NTA but do speak to him about the things that make you uncomfortable. He changed his behavior when you said something before in his mind his cousin was not included. It sounds more like a sibling relationship than anything else.", "It's gross to say a parent can never see there grown child in undergarments with out making it sexual. He was in clothing, there was no harm. But let's look at it another way, as we get older, our children will sadly have to help us in situations where they see more then ever, is that not right? If our children have an accident or need assistance in changing, bathing or bathroom needs, is that not right? There is no shame in a parent being around their kid in boxers. Don't we see them in bathing suits? It's only gross if one makes an issue where there isn't one. There's no need to sexualize something that isn't. The guy was in underwear, not NAKED! She didn't see him naked, there is nothing wrong with it! As parents sometimes it happens, not a big deal, it's our kid, there's nothing wrong with it. Now if he's naked walking around mom like that all the time, and they are hanging out naked, ok that is a bit much.", "People are allowed to have boundaries about their medical choices that aren\u2019t the same as yours. That doesn\u2019t make them unreasonable and it doesn\u2019t make them the minority.", "I have no problem with his giving a compliment. Its the way he gave it. There a problem it more a flirty one.", "Well yes commenting in someone personality is different. Its one if those that relationship are different based on genders and who attracted to what gender. Whether it is friends or family. I would have the same opinion if it was a friend.", "I don\u2019t worry about that. I don\u2019t have problems with compliments it\u2019s about being an appropriate one. Also I didn\u2019t say it was incest so you are jumping to conclusions. I find that phrase to be flirty and wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with my partner saying it to family or friends. I don\u2019t care if he gives out a compliment just be appropriate.", "That\u2019s kind of absurd reasoning though\u2026 When has anyone ever used the phrase \u201cyou\u2019re objectively attractive\u201d to boost someone\u2019s ego? It\u2019s just not something you say.", "I, too, find writing the words, \u201cDo you understand just how attractive you are?\u201d to your cousin a bit weird. I'm from anything but a conservative background, and I read it as being somewhat equivalent to, \"Do you know how hot you are?\" As OP notes, the question, vs what I would say to a friend, feels to me like the difference between expressing personal sexual interest to someone and objectively commenting to someone that s/he looks great. Like, \"I find you hot,\" vs \"You look beautiful.\" Not to say that the comment has to be interpreted sexually, but my first reaction to it, as written, was to view it that way.", "Yes? I'm literally just commenting on the severity level which op needs to be more realistic about. She never communicated this boundary, and it is reasonable for her husband to not automatically assume it would be one in this case and thus she needs to reevaluate how she's framing this to herself. \n\nIt can be a reasonable boundary if communicated. Not sure why you're assuming it's a majority/minority thing at all? Or how that's relevant. \n\nWe don't need to act like birth control is some shameful secret thing to avoid in conversation and I think it's wrong to vilify her husband for treating it in a progressive way and being proactively involved in birth control as it's relevant to him as well. It's a minor thing he's done wrong here, which again I agree that it was a mistake on his end to not have communicated prior to any conversations, just not a massive betrayal.", "It that was the only sentence he sent yes. It sounds weird and inappropriate. But if it was a sentence of a bigger conversation. The topic may make the comment make sense", "Ok. But not everyone has that same opinion, and  to expect otherwise is going to be exhausting. \n\nThey grew up together and likely don\u2019t think of the statement in a sexual way. \u201cDo you know how attractive you are?\u201d Could have been in response to comments the cousin made denigrating herself. I think not everyone reads the same sexualized connotation that you and the OP do. I know I didn\u2019t read it to the question. In fact, I initially read sarcasm and/or disbelief into it.", "Yeah, sure, bud.\n\nFlirting is entirely context dependent. \nFamily? >\"You don't know how attractive you are!\"= Trying to pump up someone's low self esteem.\n\nClose Friend? \"You don't know how attractive you are!\" Can go either way, but there needs to be some actual context for the rest of the conversation and the tone it was said in.", "Yeah the actual verbiage op shared that he wrote 'you don't know how attractive you are' can absolutely be super normal conversationally if they were talking about her insecurities in any way. Op is just choosing to read in a way that makes it sound bad. It's his close family member, not creepy", "Honestly I'm pretty sure I've said that kind of things when trying to hype my friends lol, as a way of saying \"it's not even I that think that, it's just an established fact, so please stop going against The Truth\". But obviously I wouldn't assume that anyone not saying it that way has genuine, personnal physical attraction towards the person they are talking to.", "You don't understand. None of us are acting like other people knowing that we are on birth control is a big deal. None of us are trying to make it something shameful. However, to divulge someone else's health information is not right in any level, even if you are the spouse. You need the owner of the body's permission. And OP's husband could just say that they are not trying for a baby instead of laying it out in the open. And since OP did mention she pries a lot, the rest is history.", "I don\u2019t expect everyone to agree with me. Everyone has their own comfort levels. Like i dont like to kiss my family members on the lips and dont like the idea of my partner either for germs. However some are fine with it and dont care. \n\nYou can\u2019t expect your partner to have the same comfort levels so either ask or expect it to be expressed for they didn\u2019t grow up in the same family.", "Ok - I hadn't read it that way but you make a good point.", "No you don't seem to understand anything I've said {edit: just realized you weren't the other person commenting, and I also want to acknowledge that text communication is difficult so it's easy to see how you might not be understanding me/i might not be expressing this the best way}. \n\nI am not arguing that he couldn't have said something more vague nor that it wasn't a mistake on his end, I'm simply advocating for op to deescalate how intensely severe she seems to be trying to make that mistake. Ops husband could have said something like that, yes (tbf all op has actually said is that he discussed birth control with his mother so neither you nor I know how much he actually revealed nor if op would not consider your suggestion just as bad). But he didn't, he clearly was framing it from a relationship perspective/seeing himself as part of a unit and not as a disclosure of her medical information (which again, I want op to recognize that not everyone has the auto template to consider things that way). \n\nThis isn't some betrayal of his that they can't recover from, but it is if op continues like she has in this post and comments. I hope her the best in processing and adapting to her current situation or making whatever decision is best for her."]}
