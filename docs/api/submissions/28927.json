He\u2019s a great husband overall, but his relationship with his mom and one particular cousin makes me so uncomfortable. \n\nCousin (27F) and him grew up together, were best friends since childhood, went through a horrible tragedy together etc. I took a glance at his phone screen a few days ago and saw his message to her that read \u201cdo you understand just how attractive you are?\u201d She sent him pictures of her \u201cbody transformation\u201d and he replied \u201cyou put on an insane amount of muscle\u201d. His type is muscular women with tattoos and piercings. I\u2019m a small woman with no muscles, one small tattoo and piercings on my ears and nostril, so basically not his type. This further added to the discomfort. I\u2019ve expressed to him previously how I don\u2019t like him making comments about other women\u2019s bodies and he took me seriously, but maybe he thinks his cousin is not included in that? \n\nHis mom is also a major factor behind this. She loves to talk about how she was a single mom raising him and she and him basically \u201cgrew up together\u201d. In my opinion, that\u2019s a bit strange. She also loves telling me how close they are and how they discuss everything under the sun. He and I have had discussions about this when I found out she had inquired about our sex life and he had divulged information regarding my birth control. I do not share this information with anyone, not even with my own mother. Moreover, MIL pries a lot. She is comfortable asking him anything and everything and he doesn\u2019t stop her. He made me very uncomfortable when he changed in front of his mom and walked around the house in underwear while she was there. All of this comes off as extremely emotionally incestuous to me. \n\nI talked to him about his mom and his lack of boundaries with her. He countered with \u201cno this is normal. It\u2019s probably just your upbringing and your relationship with your family that makes you feel this way\u201d. For context, I grew up in a small South Asian country in a Muslim household. I\u2019m very close to my parents, but I have pretty solid boundaries with them due to my upbringing. We were never the type to walk around in underwear in the house. My parents also do not pry and I have never thought of my cousins as \u201cattractive\u201d. He definitely did not like that I insinuated emotional incest and an inappropriate relationship between him and his mom. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019ve began to feel a form of disgust and resentment towards him.

That's a little weird.   \nHis upbringing is different from yours. That doesn't make either one of them bad.", "NTA. Feeling uncomfortable and having opinions is not asshole worthy.  What you do about them might be.  The assumption that your family dynamic is the correct one is erroneous at best.  The assumption that you are not the body type that he prefers begs the question ... why did he marry you?  The initial attraction for most pairings is visual.  From that beginning all else grows.  You need to rethink things and try to find a compromise with your husband.", "He is close to his family, he\u2019s supporting his cousin & that is a good thing. If you continue down this road, you will drive him away. As far as the mother, I was that woman. I had my child at 18, so yes, we grew up together, & I made a lot of mistakes because I was immature. We were very close & I loved him more than anything. I wanted to see him married & happy, and I got that chance. Unfortunately, we lost him to a brain tumor & I miss him terribly. \nBeing close to your child doesn\u2019t make it ugly. \nYou should talk to him about what is or is not ok to share with her.

I wouldn't worry about that (unless they start wanting to hang out alone together). You have more of an issue with his relationship with his mother. He needs to understand that she is not a part of your marriage, and more boundaries are appropriate now (like not sharing details about you to her). \n\nCan you get him to go with you to a counselor for mediated discussion?

The reason it is this and not that there are no assholes is because you want him to change, to fall in with your ways and even refer to his relationship with his mother as incestuous because he walks around in his underpants. Which is ludicrous. \n\nHis cousin is more like his sister in closeness, he is building her up and trying to increase her self confined e by the sound of it.  He has a strong, open relationship with his mum - it\u2019s great he can talk to her openly esp about stuff like birth control. \n\nYou had the option not to talk to her about those things, but did and now want him to restrict his relationships rather than working on your boundaries. \n\nStop making him out to be the weird one and go to couples counselling. You need some help. It is entirely unfair to expect him to pander to your inhibitions and moralistic views.\n\nActually after re-reading your post and the last couple of lines, you should break up. Your repulsion for him is so extreme.

Was she downing herself or telling him about negative comments she\u2019s been hearing and he was boosting her up? \n\nFemales tell their sisters and female friends that they are drop dead gorgeous all the time. Is that less weird because they\u2019re both female? \n\nIf his mom was young when she had him then they did grow up together. I find that often times in situations like that the parent and child are more friends than anything. \n\nThe fact that you feel threatened by his relationships with his female family members says more about you than him.", "YTA.\n\nFor making assumptions that do not seem to have a strong footing. \nIn some families it is totally normal to walk around in underwear or even naked. It seems like your husband has a really amazing relationship with his mother and she did a hell of a job raising him to talk this openly with her about sensitive topics. You should appreciate it rather than dislike it. \n\nFairly saying though that it\u2019s fine for you to tell him not to discuss your very personal issues with her, if it makes you feel uncomfortable. \n\nAbout the cousin\u2026 honestly, he just seems really close to his family.

His comment to his cousin may seem weird to you but it\u2019s probably him just being super supportive. They\u2019re close and have a bond. It seems like your sexualising him being undressed around his mother.", "YTA. You expect him to change for you \u2026 he\u2019s doing nothing that sounds out of line, this is a \u201cyou\u201d problem.", "NTA and this is NOT normal. I would never say that about my cousins and honestly it\u2019s feeling a bit too Alabama for me.", "NTA. To me it seems like a boundary issue with both his mom and cousin. I would sit down and really have a long talk with them about it. If that doesn't work maybe counseling.", "NTA! It's quite irrelevant that you happen to be from an Asian country Muslim household. you could hail from any country or religion and what he's doing would still be disrespectful towards you.   I can see there's a potential 1 in a million chance of a type of 'sisterhood' with the cousin. The issues between him and your mother in law, however are 100% indefensible. I  completely understand your disgust over such  highly inappropriate behaviors. OP, it concerns me that he is so completely uncaring of your feelings. Has she been pressuring him to make grandchildren by chance? Even if she has been that doesn't excuse her behavior. He sounds quite immature.", "YTA. You have described a perfectly normal family dynamic. Yes, plenty of families are comfortable around each other in their under clothes. It's not incestuous. There is no sexual element. It is just family. \nThe only wrong thing here is your husband sharing personal information that you did not want shared.

We weren't even allowed to wear sweatpants at home because being family doesn't mean that your siblings need to see you in ugly appearance and we were always supposed to be dressed nicely (and yes I am talking about alywas wearing ironed clothes even at home). I am also not allowed to talk about the birth of my son because that is bringing thoughts into her head that she doesn't want to think about.

Everyone is walking around in underwear and they don't even lock their bathroom doors (wish I would have known that before I walked in on my fil). I mean once while we were sleeping at their place I considered taking a bath and my mil actually suggested to just leave the door open so my younger bil could brush his teeth. \n\nWe had to find a compromise. I can't change the rules at his parents home but I asked him to close the door when using the toilet, to not come into the bathroom while I am on the toilet and now that we have son to please wear pants at home and not just underwear.

It is extreme that you find him repulsive and yet continue to stay with him. \n\nThe only thing I can agree with you at all about is that he shouldn't have discussed your sex life, but I don't think just saying you're on birth control is an issue unless you've clearly stated you don't want that kind of information divulged.

It could be someone self conscious being boosted by a loved one, or it could be a bit creepy. I do feel that OP violated her husband's privacy by reading his private communications though.\n\nHonestly, OP, if you have husband problems, you should be talking with your husband.

Make sure you tell him why you feel a certain way- people tend to be more agreeable if they understand reasoning behind it :) \n\nBut hope you can resolve it!", "I just want to support you by saying, I would also find being in his underwear in front of family deeply uncomfortable. I've had a friend who in their family it was normal - I found it really uncomfortable then too (and to be honest, her mother had huge boundary issues, so I don't know what to make of that). I think, just like it may feel bizarre but that's normal for some families and it's not actually an indication of anything incestuous, if it happened in my family, it would feel kind of incestuous. Basically, I feel like neither of you are wrong, as others have said, but I wanted to be at least one voice saying it who identifies primarily with your side.\n\nThat said, you're definitely still right to want privacy, and it's fair to ask for the two of you to establish boundaries between what you keep between yourselves as a couple and what sort of information it's appropriate to share with extended family such as his mother. It's not healthy in the long term for him to have no filter on what he shares with her. It makes sense that he didn't think about it this time cause it sounds like you hadn't really had some explicit conversations about it, but at least you two can be intentional about it now.\n\nGood luck. :)", "That\u2019s cultural.

It\u2019s fine to have a close relationship with your mom. There\u2019s a point where it can become too close, however. It crosses a boundary when either party\u2019s sex lives are discussed. The fact that he told her about your birth control was a major overstep that falls under that category. \n\nThe stuff with his cousin is weird. I have a ton of cousins (29 first cousins on my mom\u2019s side alone) and I grew up with two in particular. I would never, ever make a remark like the one he made to his. \n\nIt\u2019s a good sign that he\u2019s taken some of your concerns seriously, but his argument that having inappropriate conversations with his mom is \u201cnormal\u201d is concerning.

We know it means a lot to her, and we want to acknowledge her accomplishments. \n\nI think NAH. These are cultural and familial differences, no more. These behaviors are most likely not sexualized in any way for him. Further, I am extremely close with my daughter because she is my only child. We tell each other pretty much everything now that she's 21. We're best friends. Again, this is just a familial difference that is not shared by either of our spouses. \n\nYou need to just talk through these differences with him so you can better understand each other's familial past.

That\u2019s something he should be able to discuss with his Mom.", "Why? He has a good relationship with his Mom, he should be able to discuss family planning with her.", "Except it wasn\u2019t phrased like that. It was more so \u201cI think you\u2019re extremely attractive\u201d rather than \u201cyou\u2019re objectively attractive\u201d. That\u2019s what bothered me.", "Him becoming a dad because of my birth control failing has absolutely nothing to do with divulging information without my consent to his mother about what kind of birth control I\u2019m using. So no, he should not be able to discuss that with his mother. \n\nSome things are meant to be between husband and wife. Everything in our marriage involves two of us so no, he can\u2019t make a unilateral decision to reveal information that involves the both of us. \n\nMy private health information is strictly about me and only me. I\u2019m not going to argue further with you. Have a great day.", "Excuse you? Just because shes married to a man does not give him the right to go behind her back n talk about information that doesnt need/want to be shared. Ur a pathetic creature.", "Yes he can as in we currently are not looking to have kids or we thinking we are ready soon.", "That's just what you read into it since you already think their relationship is weird. It honestly seems like he's just trying to talk her up and get her to feel better about herself or boost her self esteem. \n\nNone of that really matters though. You say you're starting to find him repulsive so you should just end the relationship. It would be better for both of you. It's really shitty behavior to stay with someone you resent because you're guaranteed to let it show and take it out on him in petty ways.", "The thing is the phrase that you don't know how attractive you are can also mean the person has low self esteem but I get that his choice of wording leads things to sound weird.", "Family planning is absolutely his business to discuss with whomever he pleases! Becoming a parent is for life, and the birth control you two are using is his business too.", "Excuse you. Any baby that happens will be his, too \u2026 he has every right to discuss birth control methods with whomever he trusts.", "Again, why Is he not allowed to discuss - with his Mom or cousin or best friend - the birth control they\u2019re using? It\u2019s failure could result in a child, a lifelong commitment. He has every right to discuss such a mutual decision with trusted ones.", "He can decide with partner and dr. His mom or anyone outside of his relationship opinions on what birth control his wife should take is not okay. No one gets an opinion but the person who using it. Her body her choice and she doesn\u2019t have to share that choice if she doesn\u2019t want to. \n\nWhat do you not understand birth control is medical information that he doesn\u2019t decide who to share with. Its crossing a boundary. \n\nLike mom we are banging do you think she should take the pill or the patch? What about iud. Most people give information based on personal experience and not everyone experiences the same thing. Thats why you speak to a professional not a random family member."]}
