OP is giving the exact wrong advice. \n\n>YTA. I've been in the insurance industry for a long time. The insurance company will absolutely pay.\n\n\nI have been in the insurance industry for 20 years. Y'all are ignorasplaining how insurance policies are written and how insurers process claims. Even when the driver is at fault, impaired or not, the insurance company pays to repair the car. The owner will absolutely be responsible for paying the collision deductible but everything else will be paid by the carrier. \n\nThe OP falsely pointed to the fact that his daughter is the only named driver on her policy as a reason that the insurance company won't pay out. That's not how insurance works. Insurance premiums are based on the person or persons who regularly operate the vehicle. When someone else, even in a one off, drives the car they are automatically covered. Insurance companies can and do demand something called a named driver exclusion. If a licensed driver lives in your household who doesn't have their own car the insurance company will often insist that the person be listed and rated for on the policy. If you don't want to pay higher premiums based on that person's driving history you can exclude them from coverage. This means that the contract states that Drunk Boyfriend Jr will not be covered if he drives the car. These situations are not typical and almost never apply to a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship of a person in their early 20s. \n\nOn a road trip, your friend or lover can drive your car because they're covered. If you've got full coverage it applies to a rental car too. \n\nStop talking out of your asses. I'm not trying to ruin this post by telling y'all how shit actually works. \n\nDon't commit insurance fraud or file a false police report. Just call the effing insurance company and file a claim. They will pay. My friend's daughter and ex were killed when a disgruntled YouTuber drove his McLaren backwards on the freeway to kill himself. The insurance company paid.", "OP is not wrong abt the daughter\u2019s choices but there is a time and a place for everything. \n\nFor me the verdict rests on what she was actually asking for when she called and how badly injured the boyfriend is. Was she calling for emotional support? Reassurance? Guidance? Financial assistance? Also, how bad is the boyfriend\u2019s traumatic brain injury? TBIs can be permanent, debilitating, life changing injuries. The fact that he behaved like an idiot and is lucky he didn\u2019t kill someone doesn\u2019t change the fact that she probably loves him and is terrified for him. (Please note that I am not saying that this isn\u2019t totally his fault. It absolutely is and he is lucky he didn\u2019t kill someone. I am just saying it is possible to love and worry about and want the best for people who do stupid and downright criminally irresponsible things. If it was their daughter who was behind the wheel, even in that condition, they would still be at the hospital sick w worry for her. Mad as hell, yes, but also terrified and desperate to hear that she will be ok.)\n\nIf the daughter was calling because she wanted to know if they would buy her a new car, n t a and honestly I wouldn\u2019t put a cent toward a replacement vehicle. There are some lessons we learn the hard way.  \n\nIf, however, she was calling because she was upset, terrified and needed her parents\u2019 support then, honestly, the lecture could have waited til a later date.", "I would tell my kid the same thing.

You're covered. \n\nI am going to blow your mind here because it goes against what you've seen in the movies. Life insurance policies pay out for suicide as long as the policy has been inforce for at least 24 months.", "Stop ignorasplaining. I've written thousands of insurance contracts.", "If she gave him the keys to the car knowing he was drunk, his parents could sue.  You cannot enable a drunk driver.  If she served him the drinks that got him drunk, he (or parents on his behalf) can sue.  Hosts cannot over-serve a guest. This depends where you live, but it is the law where I live.", "Depends on the TBI. I have a TBI and hypoxic brain injury and I\u2019m still able to maintain my 6 figure job. My memory is crap, emotional regulation is more challenging and I get overstimulated easily but I\u2019m pretty close to the person I was before.", "[removed]", "Yeah my insurance only covers me or people named as permissive drivers on the policy, in my case, my mom, as sometimes I need rides places but am not physically capable of driving at that exact moment due to illness/injury. We take my car so we don't use her gas on my dr visits. It's easier to have her on the policy. But I pay like $10 to have an additional driver on my insurance.\n\nEdit: a typo.", "She probably had a broad form policy, which insures the license instead of the vehicle and would thus insure her to drive any car (including hers) and nobody else. A lot of people are going broad form these days as rates rise, especially if they have multiple cars. It doesn't afford the same protection to a car, but if you're a safe driver with a decent measure of luck you can live mostly without fear. \n\nSource: insurance agent", "We don't know from OP's post that the daughter \"let\" him. The fact that OP told the daughter to report it stolen suggests to me that the bf took it without her knowledge or consent, or at least with only her implied and not active consent.", "No one ELSE was hurt.", "Op didn't say the severity of the TBI. Most aren't that big of a deal. I've had five and only one of them gave me light amnesia", "I would hope so but young people are, inherently, inexperienced in life. They don\u2019t know what is normal/acceptable especially in romantic relationships. She might see him as a hurt victim who needs her full attention and support not an idiot who put lives at risk and cost her thousands of dollars.\n\nMales and females both do this. Younger people in general are happy with attention, affection, and cool clothes/attitude. As they get older they care about reliability, self motivation/control, and emotional maturity. You know you\u2019re old when an 800 credit score is sexy.\n\nOP may have unknowingly pushed his daughter away slightly by not showing empathy. \n\nHope things work out OP, he was just being practical", "Wow, thank you for explaining that. Idk what prompt your first comment but it really helped some like me, a random redditor, understand things I never knew before. I appreciate you answering my question and taking the time to even provide an example. Things like this impact and are involved in our everyday lives so it's pretty cool to have a better grasp on it.   \n\nI've always had a fear of driving any of the other cars. I know it sounds silly but I have this like irrational, illogical, uncomfortable feeling driving my sister's car if she's not in it. Same with my mom's. Sometimes they've had one too many so I have to drive, or if i have to drive my sisters car cause she has the car seat to pick up my nephew....and I just think omg if we crash and survive will they insurance pay???\n\nYes, I do take anti-anxiety medicine. \ud83e\udd23\n\nAnyway, all in all... I am grateful for your expertise \ud83e\udd0d Thank you.", "Dude should burn in hell.
