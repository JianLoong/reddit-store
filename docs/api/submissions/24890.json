OP is giving the exact wrong advice. \n\n>YTA. I've been in the insurance industry for a long time. The insurance company will absolutely pay.\n\n\nI have been in the insurance industry for 20 years. Y'all are ignorasplaining how insurance policies are written and how insurers process claims. Even when the driver is at fault, impaired or not, the insurance company pays to repair the car. The owner will absolutely be responsible for paying the collision deductible but everything else will be paid by the carrier. \n\nThe OP falsely pointed to the fact that his daughter is the only named driver on her policy as a reason that the insurance company won't pay out. That's not how insurance works. Insurance premiums are based on the person or persons who regularly operate the vehicle. When someone else, even in a one off, drives the car they are automatically covered. Insurance companies can and do demand something called a named driver exclusion. If a licensed driver lives in your household who doesn't have their own car the insurance company will often insist that the person be listed and rated for on the policy. If you don't want to pay higher premiums based on that person's driving history you can exclude them from coverage. This means that the contract states that Drunk Boyfriend Jr will not be covered if he drives the car. These situations are not typical and almost never apply to a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship of a person in their early 20s. \n\nOn a road trip, your friend or lover can drive your car because they're covered. If you've got full coverage it applies to a rental car too. \n\nStop talking out of your asses. I'm not trying to ruin this post by telling y'all how shit actually works. \n\nDon't commit insurance fraud or file a false police report. Just call the effing insurance company and file a claim. They will pay. My friend's daughter and ex were killed when a disgruntled YouTuber drove his McLaren backwards on the freeway to kill himself. The insurance company paid.", "OP is not wrong abt the daughter\u2019s choices but there is a time and a place for everything. \n\nFor me the verdict rests on what she was actually asking for when she called and how badly injured the boyfriend is. Was she calling for emotional support? Reassurance? Guidance? Financial assistance? Also, how bad is the boyfriend\u2019s traumatic brain injury? TBIs can be permanent, debilitating, life changing injuries. The fact that he behaved like an idiot and is lucky he didn\u2019t kill someone doesn\u2019t change the fact that she probably loves him and is terrified for him. (Please note that I am not saying that this isn\u2019t totally his fault. It absolutely is and he is lucky he didn\u2019t kill someone. I am just saying it is possible to love and worry about and want the best for people who do stupid and downright criminally irresponsible things. If it was their daughter who was behind the wheel, even in that condition, they would still be at the hospital sick w worry for her. Mad as hell, yes, but also terrified and desperate to hear that she will be ok.)\n\nIf the daughter was calling because she wanted to know if they would buy her a new car, n t a and honestly I wouldn\u2019t put a cent toward a replacement vehicle. There are some lessons we learn the hard way.  \n\nIf, however, she was calling because she was upset, terrified and needed her parents\u2019 support then, honestly, the lecture could have waited til a later date.", "I would tell my kid the same thing.
