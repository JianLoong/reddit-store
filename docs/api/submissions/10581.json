The only way to clean urine out of a pool is to drain the entire pool and refill it with clean water.", "That's not how chlorine works! Chlorine is there to kill bacteria and algae, it doesn't remove contamination or \"kill the pee\". In fact, urine reacts with chlorine to form chloramines, which are not only toxic, but interfere with the other cleaning chemicals ability to clean the water. The only way to clean urine contamination out of a pool is to drain it completely and refill it with clean water.

I assumed this person was a guy.", "But the OP is 15 and shouldn't have let the child they were babysitting pee in a pool. They are way old enough to know better than that. It's not the child they were babysittings responsibility to go the bathroom themselves because they need an \"adult\" to go with them so they don't get kidnapped. A 15 year babysitting should be old enough to take that responsibility and make sure that child makes it to the bathroom facilities.", "I agree.  That's why I said it's ironic that the child knows better than the babysitter. I was agreeing that age doesn't factor in here since the youngest person (the child) knew better.", "Ok my bad.
