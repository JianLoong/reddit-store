He likes this place so he talked with the owner and agreed to stay here. He asked me if he could buy some furniture from me so I said okay and we agreed on a price.

Its a 1 bedroom apartment with a hall.3 months ago my friend/senior from my company started living here. He said it was temporary but continued to live and I didn't say much because he was a senior at work and basically taught me my job (I was a fresher when i joined). 2 months ago I had to go to my hometown for more than a month and he didn't really find another place, so I asked him to pay half rent +electricity+gas bills. He used to send me only half rent each month that too after me asking 4-5 times every time.\n\nSo today I informed him that I wanted to empty the flat as I was moving out of the city. He likes this place so he talked with the owner and agreed to stay here. He asked me if he could buy some furniture from me so I said okay and we agreed on a price. But as always he's not paying me any money and I feel like I've been taken advantage of. He already owes me 5.2k (Previous months bills) + 6k for the furniture he supposedly bought from me. \n\n\nI came home today and emptied all my stuff which included the furniture and my own stuff and left.

You gave him *plenty* of warning beforehand and told him what you'd do if he didn't pay before the movers came.", "NTA", "NTA. Nothing in life is free. You agreed, verbally, on a price to buy the furniture, but he didn't pay you in time, so you're not obligated to keep that agreement. Also, you warned him that you would take it with you if he didn't pay you by a certain date (moving day), so you actually kept your word. It's on him. And he is taking advantage of you to the point you might consider small claims court to get your money, but be aware that anything you do in your private life will trickle into your work life, so this might be a scenario you have to run by HR. Document everything.", "NTA. This is crazy, you were just used there.", "NTA.  He was using you.", "NTA - this man sounds very, very shady", "It sucks but lesson learned.  Move on with your life.", "NTA. Good for you. You've lost enough money with this dude.", "Unfortunately we both switched jobs some time ago. We used to work in the same company before and that's how I know him.", "To think of it, it was my mistake that I let him live in my house as a guest for so long. I didn't know he'd be this kind of a person. So it's a bit of my fault there.", "I am talking about a legal procedure, not about just showing up at his workplace and demanding money, but literally having a court document that entitles you to money owed.", "NTA.  You asked him to pay by a certain time and he didn\u2019t, so you had a right to take these things.  I think that if you left them there, you would probably have to ask again and again for the money, and he would still not pay.  You acted according to your experience with him, and he is a very unreliable person.  NTA", "NTA. He is a moocher.", "NTA he was taking advantage of you", "NTA", "Nope. You warned him. He ignored your advice. NTA.", "While sad he took advantage, not a surprise either. I'd go to court or speak to a lawyer at least if possible to recover the 5k for bils.", "nta", "He took advantage of you. You put a stop to it after giving him many chances to pay his share. You owe him nothing. NTA"]}
