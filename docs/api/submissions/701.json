In order to make it fair for every dancer, my teacher asked who hasn\u2019t been in the front row so they could be moved up and I was the only one who raised my hand, when I know for a fact I wasn\u2019t the only one who hadn\u2019t been in the front row yet. This resulted in me being placed front and center for the rest of the routine. I am afraid everyone thinks IATA for moving front and centre when there are others who hadn\u2019t been there either.
