He does it out of love. So he doesn\u2019t like us to tell others what Santa brings. Instead of he wants to tell others what he got for Christmas he can say I got x,y and z at dad\u2019s house.\n\nPut honestly this year he is still young enough to not really realize the Santa concept. Most kids his age think everything is from Santa. So you still have time to come up with a solution that works in your situation. So I would not stress this year and work on being on the same page with compromise this year. It\u2019s 2 weeks before Christmas you obviously are not going to change the coparents mind. So why add more stress this year just think of a creative way to handle future years.", "YTA\n\nYou can control what happens in your own home.

Your kids are young so you haven\u2019t seen it as much yet but the other kids will get big Santa gifts too. Surprisingly even my kids\u2019 poorest friends get expensive gifts from Santa. I was always of the mindset to only have one gift come from Santa and everything else from the parents, but everyone does it differently and your kid will not break any other kids heart after Christmas talking about it. The economy isn\u2019t bad enough that kids don\u2019t get presents.

Families with step siblings can be tricky to navigate as you have to explain first why did step brother got a shiny new toy from Santa whereas your daughter didn't.

A \"boundary\" is not wanting to be hugged, for example, and is about how people interact with YOU and your autonomy, not on how others can think and behave with others. \n\nYou can certainly share your opinion and ask your coparent to agree with you, just like coparents have to decide about kids playing sports, getting a license, going on trips, etc. And just like with many other parents, you have to compromise and negotiate when you two don't agree (one parent thinks the kid can get a car ay 16, the other thinks it isn't safe, neither is wrong). \n\nAnd so no, you aren't an AH for ASKING your co parent to make the big presents from him and not Santa. But, if he doesn't agree, that's the end of it. Your opinion is of equal value to his, and you can't control what he does around presents in his own home, for his own children. \n\nYTA because of course you made this a \"boundary\" and you didn't just ask, you are demanding it be done your way.", "Yta it\u2019s not your business , do what u please at your home he can address it from Santa if he wants", "YTA. Other people\u2019s Christmas\u2019s have nothing todo with your kids so why would you try lowering the quality of your kids Christmas?\n\nIf you actually feel  so strongly about others suffering maybe y\u2019all should just eat ramen noodles and beans since that\u2019s what other people can afford?", "N T A for the Santa part, but only because it is going to set a precedent for the future. He is probably going to wonder why Santa gave presents that were bigger value at one home and not the other. \n\nWhen I got divorced I was given full custody & he had visitation. My boys knew about Santa but my daughter didn\u2019t. Her brothers told her that Santa would always come to my o house so he wouldn\u2019t get confused about who was where. This gave me Christmas morning every year, and the morning was really special to me. Ex didn\u2019t bother to argue. I would tell him what I planned for Santa presents and he would pay half. This meant his presents were smaller & not as many though. My daughter isn\u2019t someone who compared the money spent by anyone so that didn\u2019t matter. For years after Santa was revealed I still got the mornings because it was the norm and tradition. \n\nThat all said Y T A for trying to control his spending. I suppose you can both do Santa gifts, but perhaps he can have similar prices items, or less presents with the same total spent, and the rest from him. This is easily explained by saying he has more money to spend because his income is higher, or whatever you come up with. \n\nETA overall. Co parenting is trying to come to a compromise over what is best for the child. Did I give my weekend time up when their great grandma on dad\u2019s side visited from Canada? Hell yes, and without reservation. It was their great grandmother, she was 85, and she lived out of the country. Could your ex still give the same gifts but less from Santa? Easily, and it is an easy fix to the entire problem\n\nYou both need to do better on things like this. IMO anonymous & unknown beings like Santa, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter bunny that are celebrated by almost everyone should be pretty seamless between households. Otherwise you have a high risk of your kid figuring things out earlier than they would have otherwise.", "Can he have little gifts from Santa and big items from dad/mom?", "YTA. He\u2019s the parent too. What he chooses to do for the kids in his own home is his decision. That\u2019s not a boundary, that\u2019s you trying to be controlling because he\u2019s doing well for himself. You\u2019re not thinking of your kid, you\u2019re thinking about yourself. Stop being selfish and making your kids Christmas about you.", "YTA.  You can't make rules for other people.

Santa/parent/neighbor/whatever, they are just happy to get the presents.", "YTA I understand your feelings but to deny a kid things because others can\u2019t afford them is punishment for things outside their control", "NAH. I actually agree with you, luxury/big gifts should be from parents with more reasonable ones from Santa. Kids talk at school and it sucks when everyone else got something amazing from Santa and the poorer kids have nothing. When you\u2019re little, it takes away from the magic. \n\nSo I think you had every right to ask and it doesn\u2019t seem like a hill worth dying on for him.

Compromising is surely key in coparenting and I\u2019d like us to come to a middle ground. I do have 2 bigger gifts for him (one of them being the same exact thing my coparent got for his own house) and offered to compromise and do a singular big gift from Santa from each of us and maybe an additional small one that we have.

I grew up on the lower income side of things in an area where most other kids had more wealthy parents. Coming back from Christmas break was torture, some years and it never made sense (when I still believed) why Santa brought me little things and the wealthy kids got the biggest and best things of the year. I want our son to appreciate everything he gets. I don\u2019t want him to have this super high expectation of Santa right off the bat the first year of him even understanding the concept of Christmas and Santa.

My daughter has bigger gifts, as well. We have just always had the agreement that our bigger gifts would stay from us and choose something on a smaller scale/handmade gifts from Santa until this year. My coparent went a little overboard on bigger gifts because he could this year, which I\u2019m not mad about that so much as he wants to make every big gift from Santa. Instead of maybe just one or two, which is what I have since suggested to him since posting this to come to a compromise.

We\u2019ve had this agreement on Santa for years until now. I think he was defensive without truly understanding what I was trying to get across and what I want our son to understand for future years. I don\u2019t mind the big gifts at all. Would just prefer not ALL of them, if any, to be from Santa.

I mentioned maybe a singular bigger thing being from Santa and he seems okay with it but still not 100%. I know I can\u2019t control what he does at his home for his portion of holidays. But we have agreed for the last 3 years up until now about Santa bringing smaller/handmade gifts. I come from a family where we didn\u2019t get anything big at all from Santa and I\u2019m trying to show some compromise because I know not everyone grew up like that. The \u201cruining our son\u2019s Christmas\u201d just has me really doubting myself and the way I\u2019m choosing to represent Santa in my home after our previous years of 100% agreement.

We\u2019ve had the same agreement for the last 3 years of our separate holidays. All those years, we have both been able to gift him bigger things but always addressed from one of us and never Santa. I am compromising with him about maybe making one of the big things from Santa but not the other several big things he bought and I\u2019m still \u201cruining our son\u2019s Christmas.\u201d We actually ended up with the same bigger gift for each of our houses this year and I offered maybe that as an option. \u201cSanta thought you might want to have this at both houses so he brought you one for each\u201d kind of thing.", "Very well said. I wasn\u2019t trying to come off as trying to control his spending/what he gets for our son.

This is our first year where we are realizing \u201coh crap he\u2019s starting to understand the imaginary characters that we create magic for\u201d so I think my brain went to \u201clet\u2019s keep him humble\u201d and his dad\u2019s brain went to \u201cwow I can actually afford to create some GOOD magic this year\u201d so now we are discussing what the middle ground may look like for us as a coparenting team.

My thought is that I want my children to understand that Santa isn\u2019t all about the best/biggest thing of the year.

You\u2019re thinking like an adult instead of a toddler. A toddler doesn\u2019t care about the size, cost or value of an item. They do not remember from one year to the next what they received. They don\u2019t tally up the gift amounts. It\u2019s so much simpler to them. My kids didn\u2019t even open all their gifts on Christmas. They stopped and played with the one they liked whether it was the box, the paper, the toy or someone else\u2019s toy that they fancied. Santa will be a rockstar if he brings an empty refrigerator box, not so much with a $200 toy.", "I understand your worry. I really do. \n\nBut I would maybe step back and look at his perspective. Maybe he feels like he let your son down this year by not being able to provide as much as he likes. \n\nI am sure if you guys coparent great every other time if you set down and look at each others point of view you will come up with a way to handle future years.\n\nBut honestly he is so young this year I don\u2019t know if I would let it eat at me. I think I would let it go this year. Then next year you and him set down and explain your son will be at the age he will truly understand what is from Santa and what is from mom and dad. Let him know that he will be starting school next year and you don\u2019t want other kids to fell hurt. It also may be more realistic to instead use homemade gifts, you and the ex come up with Santa bringer amount of gifts no more then x amount of dollars to each house. Homemade gifts are hard to keep each house equal. But if you say Santa brings 3 gifts each one being no more than $10-15 to both homes there is a base line of what is to be expected. \n\nTell your ex this keeps your son from feeling like hey Santa brought me an Xbox at dads and a foot ball at moms. So I would rather spend Christmas at dads.   I hope that makes sense.", "Realistically, it isn\u2019t worth getting upset. He\u2019s too young to care and once he\u2019s old enough to care, he\u2019ll be around other kids, and will be told that there\u2019s no Santa. You\u2019ve got only a couple Santa years left. He won\u2019t get the luxury of time to believe like we did.", "The second you and dad split is the second he lost all say in what happens at dad's house (obviously not talking abuse) but the day to day running of dad's house you have no say in you should get used to that", "My kids always got their stockings and one nice gift from Santa. The rest from us. You can't control what other people do. Their friends got all their gifts from Santa. I don't think the kids discussed who gave them which gifts.", "And that's fine and dandy if you want to do so within the walls of the house you and your husband pay for. By all means. But outside of that house, and in the house that your ex pays for and is responsible for, you have exactly zero right to try and dictate how he gifts his child, especially when those items are staying there. Unless your custody agreement dictates that an agreement must be reached and maintained on the way you teach your kids regarding things of this nature, you have the right to ask and he has the right to do absolutely nothing with your request. Just as you can do if he asks something completely out of bounds as well.", "I can understand your feelings. However, he has changed his mind. So, you\u2018ll have to adjust your strategy.", "But your son might not even remember from year to year who the gifts are from, let alone how big they are. This will also be a teaching moment as parents in terms of different things happening at both houses. Plans aren't going to always mesh...", "I was raised in a house where my parents made a point at telling us that all the gifts that were under the tree were from them except one that was from Santa. It was important to them that we understand that they were working hard and that gifts are not magically appearing for us once a year.\n\nSo I understand your point. But your kids have or will have friends outside of the family. Are you going to argue with their parents and telling them that Santa shouldn't bring expensive gifts for their children as well because your kids can't have them at your house ?\n\nSo NTA for asking this to your ex. BUT YTA insisting on how he should deal with the presents he bought himself based on what's happening in your life.", "Probably you do have different ideas about it but that's okay. I doubt your son will even notice a difference.", "Interesting. I talk about this all the time with my son...example, I bought him a Switch and he wants to bring it to his dad's. I tell him no, what he has in this home stays in this home. He thinks it's unfair but kids are too young to understand the deeper rationale. \n\nFairness is a part of life, no matter how old you are. Learning to accept and cope with that is an important life lesson.\n\nEdited to add: maybe \"fair\" in my original comment is misplaced...better to say \"problematic\".", "The sudden flip is absolutely normal post-divorce. People agree to and go along with things they're not keen on for the sake of the relationship. Once the divorce happens there's no need to agree anymore and they prioritise how they want to do things.\n\nI do understand your concerns and I think NAH as long as you drop the topic and accept that you don't get veto power over your ex's parenting decisions. Things are going to be different in different houses, even if you had the best co-parenting relationship in the world.", "I don't see where it matters.  So...YTA.", "My mom had similar ideas as you only we were the poor kids and my older brother went to a rich school so his first Christmas there all the kids got tons of stuff from Santa and my mom and dad made a deal with Santa so that he would do 1 big gift and out stockings so that he could give other big gifts to others kids. \n\nYou can discuss something similar with your ex but ultimately you each decide how Santa interacts with your houses separately and should have little say in how they other operates as long as it\u2019s not harming your child.", "That honestly helps so much! Thank you. It is hard to readjust this year but we\u2019re gonna try to roll with it. We\u2019re actively communicating about the situation now so hopefully we come to a decent middle ground. I suggested even making only one of those big things from Santa since I do have a bigger item able to be given.", "Yes. We\u2019ve been separated since our son was 6 months old. It\u2019s definitely an ever changing thing."]}
