My best friend of 20 years has \"broken up\" with me after I gave her kiddo one max two drops of melatonin during a sleepover at my place\n \nBackground: we've been friends for around 20 years, our kids are great friends\nWe were at a mutual friends house and her youngest (7) and my (7) were having a great time. I offered for hers to have a sleep over at mine since they were having such a great time, and she needed to leave. \n\nI got the kids to mine and they were super pumped. Having a big next day ahead of us, my 7yo asked for melatonin, I gave her some, and offered some to my friends kiddo\n \nDosage is 20 drops, I gave her LO one max two drops. \n\nShe knows I give my kiddos it when needed, and I take it too as needed. She's talked about wanting to try it too. \nI told her when they were asleep and that I'd given him some\n \nShe responded saying oh I should try some too\n \nA week later she calls to tell me she's incredibly upset and it was a breach of trust not asking her first. \nI profusely apologised that she felt that way, and took full responsibility. I love her kids like they are my own and would never put them I'm danger.\n\nShe then proceeded to tell me I'm hard to be friends with, and she thinks we shouldn't be friends with anymore\n \nThere's a bit of background with me having post natal depression during the pandemic and her helping me. I'm so grateful for that \n\nBut I'm tired of being the one being blamed for everything. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdited: ok. The crowd has spoken. Appreciate the feedback as hard as it was to see \n\nI'll accept the consequences of poor judgement, and say goodbye to that friendship. \n\nHuge life lesson.\n\nEDIT2: I have my answer. Thanks to those who were kind. To those who are rude. I hope that you feel better. Going to protect my mental health and not read anymore.  \nI f'ed up. I accept it. And am incredibly sorry.  \nFYI melatonin is not a drug or medication it's a dietary supplement. it's an over the counter sleep aid my Dr recommended due its safe nature.

You don\u2019t give anyone else\u2019s kids something without the parent\u2019s permission. I get it\u2019s not a drug per se, but it\u2019s not food either. You could have texted her and said \u2018hey is this ok or nah?\u2019 It absolutely was a breach of trust. \n\nLet alone, your kid gets 20 drops, and her kid got 1? Why even bother at that point?", "Yta - plain and simple. You gave medicine to a child who is not your child without permission. It doesn't matter how close you are to a person, you don't give medicine to their child. \n\nShoot, I even call before giving my niece allergy meds to make sure it's okay! And she's with me a fair amount of the time.", "YTA. You were completely out of line giving anything to someone else\u2019s child without their permission.", "YTA. \n\nYeah, it was weird that she waited a week to say she was upset. \n\nBut it is wildly inappropriate and boundary crossing to give drugs to someone else\u2019s kids without permission, especially a sleep aide he doesn\u2019t even need.    That was a major lapse in judgment on your part and I could understand why she would rethink your friendship.", "How would feel if someone didn't ask you and gave your kid a strange medicine?", "My kid was at a sleepover and the mom texted asking if she could have some since her daughter takes it. I said I appreciate her asking but it\u2019s best not to. She knows my oldest in the past has had issues with sleep walking and I let her know that melatonin can exacerbate this. She hadn\u2019t sleep walked in a while by that point and I didn\u2019t want to test out the hypothesis! YTA", "Fair you've already said you mess up, but as a response to your edit: melatonin is not just \"a supplement\" it's a hormone. It's as much of a \"drug\" as taking any other hormone is (thyroxine, insulin, oestrogen etc etc). Where I live you can't even get it without a prescription. It has side effects and can't be taken by anyone. \n\nYTA, but I know you didn't have bad intentions. But maybe you need to learn more about what you're taking if you think it's just a supplement. And def never give anything to other people's kids, supplement or not, with out their permission.", "To your edit: no one was really rude here. You asked for judgement, and that\u2019s what you got. I do feel badly for you that you have taken this so personally, but that seems like a theme for you that you\u2019re already aware of. \n\nI would, at the very least, apologize to your friend and take full responsibility. Then let the chips fall where they may. \n\nI already commented judgment so I won\u2019t do it again. I just wanted to reply to your edit. \n\nGood luck", "YTA\n\nDon't give hormones to other people's kids without asking first. Yeah, it wasn't a high dose and probably harmless. Still. It's a med. Ask first.", "YTA\n\nThe justification doesn't matter. Don't give people's children things medicines or supplements or whatever they they haven't consented to. Doesn't matter if she's been curious. Or if she said she should try some. She didn't say you should try it with her child.", "YTA, I read your most recent edit too and while melatonin is something your body produces naturally and can at some places be bought without a prescription needed, that doesn\u2019t mean you can give it to anyone. Especially not someone else\u2019s child without their direct permission beforehand. At the end of the day any form of medication isn\u2019t something you give to a kid without a parents permission, it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of medication it is", "YTA\u2014 as most people said, that was not appropriate.\n\nBut more importantly, you don\u2019t end a friendship of 20 years over this, which makes me think there is a lot more going on here than just melatonin. Your friend is probably tired of dealing with recurring and annoying issues with you.", "Technically, YTA because you gave someone else\u2019s kid medicine without the parent\u2019s explicit permission.  You can get a pass for that in a case where it\u2019s clearly medically necessary and the parent isn\u2019t available (Tylenol if the kid has a bad fever) but this was not one of those cases.\n\nHowever, was it worth breaking up a whole friendship of 20 years for?  Maybe not in a vacuum, no, but this sounds like it may have been the last straw for your friend.", "YTA you still are justifying it in your responses. It may be a dietary supplement but you are messing with natural sleep patterns. Kids and adults have issues falling asleep sometimes it\u2019s natural. You need to learn to deal with it without a drug even if it\u2019s a \u201cnatural supplement \u201c.", "yeah YTA.", "YTA, doubly so for trying to minimize what you did by arguing it isn\u2019t a medication. Yes, it is. Tylenol is over the counter as well, that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a medication. It may not be anything with significant risks, but it\u2019s still absolutely not okay to medicate someone else\u2019s child without permission.", "YTA don\u2019t give kids medication or supplements without permission, the hell is wrong with you????", "YTA. Do you know what OTC dietary supplement means? It means it\u2019s not regulated by the FDA.", "YTA, though light. Yeah it's weird that she got mad a week later and that you've talked about giving it to kids before and she's expressed an interest in it. But you really do need clear permission to give something like a sleep aid to a kid, I'm pretty sure child care workers have been arrested for doing something like that.\n\nIt really sounds like there's a lot of other issues in your friendship and this is just one thing that's brought it all out of her for some reason.", "YTA. Even if your intention is clear, you must always ask permission to the parents. Especially giving medicines because you don't know the kid's medical history and if the kid is allergic to it might be life threatening. When she reacted to it a week later, I presume she had a discussion with someone that made her realize what could go wrong.", "YTA. You gave it to the kids for your own convenience to calm them down. And you gave it to her child without asking her first. If it's just the \"placebo effect\" as you said, you don't actually have to give them Melatonin, but could substitute something without known side effects.\n\nBut it sounds like there is a lot more to unpack here than this single incident. Maybe after a cooling off period, you all can patch things up and still be friends.", "YTA \n\nThat was a lapse in judgment on your end", "YTA because it doesn't matter how safe you (or me, for that matter as I consider it safe too) think it is, giving supplements to someone elses child should require permission. \n\nI think it's not about that though, it sounds like this was more the last straw. I'm sorry your friendship has ended.", "YTA\n\nAnything to do with others children - needs to be asked about first.", "Unless recommended by your pediatrician, you probably shouldn\u2019t be giving any kid melatonin", ">FYI melatonin is not a drug or medication it's a dietary supplement.   \nit's an over the counter sleep aid my Dr recommended due its safe   \nnature. If it was a drug I would have called even if it was after   \nmidnight.\n\nI know you think that makes it better, but the fact that it is a supplement makes it worse.   Over the counter drugs, like Tylenol or Benadryl or tested by the FDA for safety and effectiveness, supplements are not regulated, and thus should be viewed with more caution.", "It doesn't matter that melatonin is \"natural\". I had to stop taking it because it has a negative interaction with one of my medications. Please stop and learn that just because something is natural doesn't mean it's safe. YTA.", "In Germany Melatonin is only allowed for adults. Here  Kids don't get medication to sleep. \nIf someone give that to my kid without asking first I would have blown up!

Don't give medication to strangers especially kids.", "Bruh, you drugged someone else's kid... How could you have not seen that YTA immediately", "YTA  you dont give anything to anyone elses kids without parents permission", "YTA. While it's strange that your friend waited a week to say something (perhaps she was mulling it over), the fact remains that you should never give a child anything without explicit permission from their parent/guardian. There was no way of knowing how her child would react to melatonin.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s common sense not to give kids any medication without permission of the parents.", "YTA. \n\nYou'd never be allowed to even be in the same building, let alone the same room as my kids ever again. Regardless of it's classification, don't drug other people's kids, ever.", "YTA \n\n1) You don\u2019t get to decide people aren\u2019t allowed to respond to your post because you\u2019ve had enough. That\u2019s not how this works. Turn off your notifications if it\u2019s bothering you so deeply instead of throwing a tantrum via edits. \n\n2) as many others have said, melatonin is unregulated. It\u2019s always important to check in with the parent. \n\nThat being said, there is obviously more to this situation than what you are telling us.", "YTA.\nYou didn\u2019t know if the child was allergic or anything.\nNever give anything to a child without permission.\nI ask my daughter if I can give my teen grands pain reliever for a headache when they are with me.", "You defending Melatonin because it\u2019s a \u201cdietary supplement\u201d is a bunch of bullshit.

That's a lot of any supplement. You're drugging your kids so you can sleep easier and not be bothered, and including their friends in this routine. Because melatonin is naturally produced, you can create an imbalance and throw off their bodies natural production and regulation of it. If you can't sleep because your kids are awake, practice removing electronics earlier, less sugar, no late snacks, reading, exercising, any different bedtime routine than drugging your kids. This has nothing to do with their needs or a benefit to them, it's all about you, and it sounds like your self involvement is why she ended the friendship. \n\nYou need to see a therapist, and you need to talk to your children's pediatrician to discuss damage control for you shoving huge amounts of hormones down your kids throats every night.", "Yta. Melatonin is a drug. You can't even get it in the UK without prescription.
