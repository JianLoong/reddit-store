Our friend who lives near our beach house is having a Christmas party and we were intending on going.\n\nThe short version of the story is that this morning I woke at 8am to my husband hassling me to get up so we could leave. He said that he had been awake since 5am. \n\nI went to the store for last minute Christmas presents for my husband\u2019s family, the party friend and beach house neighbours. I also bought us breakfast. During this time he sat around in his shorts with a coffee at home. We packed the car and we headed off. \n\nWe dropped by his sister\u2019s house to give her family their presents. Then we ran an errand. There was a problem with the errand because they told me the wrong time that they closed and I forgot that they wanted payment in cash. (According to my husband they specified cash when we spoke with the store 2 months ago.) Luckily I called them while my husband was driving so they stayed open for us and my husband had cash.\n\nWe were just leaving city limits when I double checked with my husband that he had brought in our grocery delivery off the street.\n\nNarrator\u2019s voice: He had not. \n\nTo be fair, I received the text this morning and I forgot to mention it. I had partly assumed he would have had a conversation with the delivery guy but apparently the guy didn\u2019t call the intercom.\n\nMy husband started banging the steering wheel and flopping his head around. He turned the car around and headed back home. My husband was in no mood to head out to the beach house or attend the Christmas party. He told me that he was extremely angry and that he was disappointed to miss the party. He said that he was sick of \u201csaving me\u201d. First the store and now this.\n\nHe is currently not speaking with me. I took in the groceries and put them away. I gave him an hour at home to cool down. Then I offered to drive to the beach house so that we could still make the party in time. My husband declined. He said that he is too angry and now he will not come out of the bedroom.\n\nI know that I dropped the ball here but I was so flustered with lots of things to do and my husband constantly badgering me to leave \u2026 that I feel like he is overreacting. Is forgetting the groceries really so bad? Am I really the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1702099963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18e6ieb/aita_for_forgetting_the_groceries/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I spent part of the story thinking you had missed a lot of deadlines, but then partway through I realized you had missed a lot of deadlines because you had an unreasonable amount of deadlines to begin with. Your husband seemingly had 0 responsibilities. Why did everything fall on your shoulders? Why is it your fault that he missed bringing in the groceries while you did the 20 other things he expected you to do that morning? It's not. The answer is that you should never have been solely responsible for basically everything to begin with. While you rushed around town, your husband was sitting around in his shorts doing nothing, then he has the audacity to say he is always saving you? Nah. You're the one doing the saving here, but even a hero has limits.", "NTA, it was a busy day and you made a mistake. That was an accident, that makes you human not an asshole. And it shouldn't all fall on you to run all of the errands and take care of everything, when half these errands are for *his* family. You are only making so many mistakes because too many things are being piled up on you while your husband does nothing. \n\nYour husband is behaving like a huge asshole. It sounds like he has some anger issues and the way he is behaving behind the wheel is reckless and dangerous. Him refusing to go to the beach house when you could have still made the party on time is ridiculous. You're right that he is overreacting, it sounds like he overreacts to everything. Be prepared to deal with a lifetime of situations just like this one if you stay with him.", "NTA, he expected you to do everything for him... He even woke up hours before you and pestered you about getting ready to go... But didn't just go to the store himself in that time.\n\nThere was one thing that neither of you did, that he was better situated to do because he was home for HOURS and just didn't notice and that's somehow your fault too\n\nHe sounds volatile, controlling, and lazy. He's belittling you and you absolutely don't deserve it, but it sounds like he does it so much you doubt he's in the wrong even when he's being incredibly inappropriate towards you", "So, you know you aren't T A right?  You fully 100% know that?\n\nI am making many assumptions.  First, I assume that your husband was not 12y when you married him and is no longer 12y now.  Second, I assume that as an adult, he is fully able to function in society (he doesn't need any aids or assistance in doing basic life skills).  Third, I assume he has redeeming qualities (I don't assume he has many).  Granting all of these things are true, he is a grown man who can help run errands or at least remind you of errands before throwing a toddler level tantrum. \n\nThe fact that you feel you \"dropped the ball\" and aren't sure that you aren't deserving of this is more concerning.  I would inform him that he can handle his own balls, dropped or otherwise, until he apologizes for (if nothing else) his current attitude.\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "Your hubby sounds awful and it is not a matter of you being the asshole, it\u2019s a case of you starting to realize you are married to an emotionally abusive man with serious anger issues.  It\u2019s no way to live.", "NTA. He had been rattling your cage from the moment he woke you up. Then you did a whole bunch of running around while he sat at home drinking coffee. This is some serious BS. He is TA and in dire need of anger management. Don\u2019t take this crap from him. Go without him. I\u2019m sorry you are going through this.", "You are absolutely NTA. I would tell you who is but I think we both know you know who really is.\n\nThe way your husband is reacting really irks me.  It\u2019s so clear he wants you to feel bad for all of this. \nNot just the missed groceries, he wants to take his anger out on you and make you feel bad so you don\u2019t go to the party. \n\nI have been in similar situations in my marriage where\u2014despite us both forgetting something\u2014it\u2019s my fault. \nOne thing my therapist told me is that when your husband is having a rough day you can decide to still have a good day. She calls it anticipating the storm. I\u2019m sure you know your husbands tells well enough by now. You know when he\u2019s had a bad day or when something has gone wrong and you have an idea of how he will respond, locking himself away or canceling plans. \nThe storm is coming, you cannot control his response. But by anticipating the storm you can scan the situation and hoist the sails\u2014get out of there not to escape him but to not give him the satisfaction of ruining your day. You can also approach any negative tone or accusations like \u201cI\u2019m tired of saving you!\u201d with a level response. Sometimes it is better not to respond in the moment but that depends on how he would respond. \n\nIf it\u2019s not too late I say go to the dang party.\nAnd if it\u2019s too late to go to the party still go to the beach house. \nTake those groceries\u2014you said he didn\u2019t care what you ordered anyways so he won\u2019t miss it when it\u2019s gone. \n\nYou put a lot into this week and you deserve to enjoy it!", "Oh good lord he sounds dreadful. \n\nYou sound like you sure could use a relaxing weekend at the beach house. \n\nAlone. \n\nYou go get in your car and enjoy that party!", "NTA, he can stay home and cool down. You can drive yourself.", "Wow no, you are NTA. Your husband is a living breathing red flag and I fear for your safety.", "NTA. His behavior is ridiculous. There's no circumstances in which the silent treatment is ok. It's  his choice not to continue to attend. It's his choice to sulk like a small child (seriously wtf). Groceries involve the whole family. Even if the delivery guy didn't use the intercom, your husband should be taking initiative to check on it. He could have tried to get things done while he waited for you to wake up. He could have been doing something while you were out. Yo", "NTA please remind your husband that you are not, in fact , his mother .you should go without him .", "NTA, but your husband is.\n\nI don't know how you live with someone who has unreasonable tantrums, that would drive me round the bend.", "INFO  Your husband wanted to wake up and go straight to the beach house (so it seems).\n\nWhose idea was the breakfast, the gifts, the errants, the groceries? Were these all just ideas you came up with and wanted to do?", "EAH. Obviously he\u2019s the bigger AH for his laziness and behaviour. When you say he started banging the steering wheel & flipping his head around, I presume you mean he threw a tantrum like a toddler? How inappropriate and embarrassing. \n\nBut why oh why do you take on all these tasks, while he sits on his a$$ drinking coffee? Split the errands with him. Maybe he\u2019ll learn how easy it is to make a mistake or overlook something when he\u2019s actually busy contributing to your lives. And please stop coddling him with \u201ccooling off periods.\u201d If you wanted to go to the party, just go. If he wants to stay home & sulk, let him.", "NTA. Stop buying presents for his family. Stop. The mental load you are carrying is too much. He is your partner. He's supposed to help you.", "Moving forward, make a list of everything that needs to be done before you leave.  Then make sure His Highness gets off his throne and does his part.  \n\nFor the here and now, ignore his grumpy mood and pretend you don\u2019t give a rats ass about not going. Grab a good book and enjoy the silence.", "NTA exactly what does he do at home? He sits around drinking coffee moaning and complaining obviously but does he do anything else? I personally would have left him at home and went to the beach. Then he could have had a hissy fit about that too while I was at a party.", "NTA. You could have made it to the party in time, but he did not want to go there any longer. I think he overreacted in the situation. \n\nWhen he says he\u2019s \u201esick of saving you\u201c\u2014does that mean that such situations happen regularly? Maybe it was not only about what happened that day.", "NTA (or maybe NAH): there is clearly a bigger issue in the marriage. something is going on with your husband beyond the minor incidents that day, and i would suggest couple\u2019s counseling if you\u2019re not able to get to the bottom of it.", "I understand forgetting when you have a lot going on but how did he not know about the groceries? Also how far was it when you guys turned back? If you could have made it why did he keep having a fit, I honestly think that\u2019s bogus I\u2019d have left without him. Do you forget things often ?maybe set a reminder on your phone that helps me. NTAH with the info given.", "I understand your husband feeling frustrated but he needs to get a grip. No one died, the house didn't blow up and the groceries weren't stolen. Your husband has anger/ sulking issues.", "Your husband is an ASS.  It is YOUR decision whether you want to stay with him.", "Sounds like you have an abusive and lazy husband.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou messed up a lot of planned things on an already hectic day, and caused a lot of effort for your husband. \n\nAnd - on  day like that - YOU forgot the groceries and blame your husband for YOUR failure. That makes YOU the AH. Understandable that - on top of the rest - was too much for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAns: Your husband decided to end the hectic day for himself there and then - nothing wrong with that. YOu could still have gone to the party on your own.", "NTA! He went too far with his mantrum!
