While the majority of the NTA replies were reassuring to read, the most helpful ones were the NAHs and ESHs and even some YTAs.\r  \n\r  \nFirst things first, I feel I may have unintentionally cast my wife in a somewhat unfair light. She's far from the lazy, pampered princess some may have pictured. She's on her feet a fair bit, grabbing her own snacks, sipping water, and even tossing together some rice for our lunch now and then. She's really quite the team player around the house, always ready to lend a hand when she's feeling good. I often find myself encouraging her to kick back and rest.\r  \n\r  \nThe real pickle here wasn't about her helping out or not, but about her leaning on me to sort out all her meals. Reading all your comments, I had a bit of an \"aha\" moment - she genuinely didn't know what she felt like eating. And, to be totally transparent, this food decision deadlock isn't a new game for us. Pre-pregnancy, we'd often volley the \"No, you decide\" ball until one of us gave in. Now that we've got a baby on the way, I have realized it would be quite irresponsible of both of us to let her go hungry because she can't decide. While technically her responsibility to decide, I have taken up on following some advice here.\r  \n\r  \n(Quick tangent - have you ever noticed how different you can be from your partner in certain ways? Like, when I'm under the weather, I'm a big fan of sorting out my own needs - calling the doc, taking my meds, fetching my own hot water. My wife, though? She's all about caring and pampering, even when I'm barely sniffly. It's taken me a bit of time to get used to her high-level pampering expectations, but I'm getting there!)\r  \n\r  \nSo, following some solid advice from this community, I snagged \"Real Food for Pregnancy: The Science and Wisdom of Optimal Prenatal Nutrition\" and it's been quite an eye opener. I've shared the need-to-know parts with my wife (since reading makes her a tad nervous at the moment). We've come to realize we've been pretty off track with our nutrition. I told her we need to increase our protein consumption and have shared my plans on buying more meat and fish. I also started following the advice of just giving her food without asking what she wants - it actually works. Overall, I think this is making her feel that I care about her diet (and her) and our relationship has improved. I also feel pretty good about our diet now.\r  \n\r  \nIn a nutshell, we're making progress. She seems more at ease with our meal situation and I'm feeling pretty good about getting our nutrition on track.", "created_utc": 1686836521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14a2rwc/update_aita_for_not_preparing_my_pregnant_wife/", "score": 361, "replies": ["Oh, nice update!", "OP, especially now that you're going to be parents, you should both read this article about mental load:\n\nhttps://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/\n\nYou touched on this in your post, when you said it's too much to have to figure out the meals AND cook them. It's really important for couples to share this mental burden. (And as the kids grow, make sure you're not falling into a habit of letting mom take care of all the schedules and things, which often happens.)", "Good for you man. Way to take the initiative.", "One piece of advice i would give is don't put too much pressure on eating perfectly during pregnancy. Its obviously great to eat as healthily as possible, but sometimes its just as important to find something you can eat!\n\nBasically, use the knowledge you've gained to help with planning meals, but don't hold it up as a target to meet, that could just lead to unnecessary stress and guilt if its difficult to stick to.", "A good option when no one ever knows what they want to eat is either get a meal kit delivery service like Blue Apron or Hello Fresh, where you can basically tell them the nutrition profile you\u2019re going for and they send you pre portioned ingredients (usually a couple times a week) or, as that\u2019s pretty pricey, Meal prep yourself. There are a billion articles and videos, but essentially, you plan and do the prep work beforehand (sometimes up to a week in advance, sometimes a month or two), so that when you or your wife are hungry, the chopping and deciding are done. \n\nThis is a great system for crockpot recipes. I can often throw a whole meal together in under an hour (because I used to watch Chopped on the Food Network and would accept the challenge of making a meal with pretty much anything within reason) but for those times when I can\u2019t, I can grab a meal that\u2019s been pre-prepped for the crockpot (butter chicken, anyone?) and go on about my day. After 4-8 hours, meal\u2019s done and very little energy spent on food.", "Glad you are making progress.  WE have a family member and their wife have this same issue in regard to what do you want to eat.  We joked that we were going to get them a kids see n say and put food or restaurant names over each of the farm animals.  They can then pull the handle and what ever it lands on is what they do.  Never did it, but I think this gave them an idea of how annoying their indecision was to others.", "Yeah you working on your relationship like adults!!!!!!  Congrats!!", "The \"no I don't want that\" game.  We stopped that by putting everything we like on a slip of paper, put them in a hat and draw.  Whatever it is, that's what your having- period. (then put the slip back in the hat)", ">I also started following the advice of just giving her food without asking what she wants\n\n>this is making her feel that I care about her diet (and her)\n\nI have a family member who is dealing with severe anxiety and one of the things affected is their eating. Preparing food without asking them what they want has made things less stressful for everyone, and taking some trouble with the food and the presentation makes them feel loved. Glad this is working for you too \u2661", "This is a good update. One thing though is don\u2019t put too much pressure on her having the perfect diet. She may have cravings and that\u2019s ok too", "Aw! Sweet", "We use a meal kit delivery service, which is awesome, but very annoyingly has become something that triggers my nausea in pregnancy. Every time I consider eating or actually eat something from there I feel sick. And I'm through all my other morning sickness symptoms, so I think this one is intent on sticking around! \n\nHowever I totally agree, even outside of pregnancy these sort of kits are so good for just taking that mental load away.", "Could be a psychological thing! I was on the gluten challenge for a month and it got so bad last week even water repulsed me. My gastro told me I could stop the challenge Monday and now I\u2019m eating normally again. Your subconscious may be trying to protect you with that response. Maybe a different one (meal kit service) could break that barrier? It could be the visual cues of the box bc you used it during a time where you were sick a lot. \n\nAlso, maybe somehow have someone cook the food without you seeing the box. Our bodies can be very much like children in the way of assumptions and the level of drama with which they react. If it doesn\u2019t have a distinct aroma or anything, you may be able to remind your body that food\u2019s safe even if it comes in the scary box. \n\nHope that helps!", "Nice update. Something that works for me is low-key meal planning. Usually on Fridays during happy hour, I draft a list of dinners that would be good for the following week. That helps me figure out what I want to buy at the Saturday farmer\u2019s market. Then every night after dinner I make a final decision about the next night\u2019s dinner. Maybe I follow the plan I made on Friday, and maybe I don\u2019t. But at least I don\u2019t need to start with a blank page every single day. \n\nI also keep a list of whatever unused fresh ingredients we have on hand. It minimizes waste and also makes meal planning more interesting as I solve the puzzle of how to use up the leftover half cup of coconut milk.", "I was one of the formerly pregnant people who suggested to just put food in front of her because she probably literally didn't know what she wanted. I'm glad it's working out!", "... why does reading make her nervous? That seems like an excuse.", "Glad this turned out well!", "Heck yeah bro it\u2019s always good to see two people love eachother enough to be humble and learn and change.", "Thanks for the update! I considered you NTA, but I love that you were open to the criticism from other votes and learned from it.", "When people are stressed out, decision paralysis and executive function disorders become a problem. Basically \"I'm already dealing with the big issues of X,Y, and Z, so I don't have the headspace for question/issue A.\" Limiting options can definitely be helpful. Usually adults can handle an open-ended question like \"What do you want for dinner?\" But in times of stress, if someone offers \"I'm making [blank] for dinner tonight. Do you want some?\" or \"I was thinking of ordering from place X or place Y. Does one of those sound better?\" it can really ease the burden for the person who's struggling.\n\nAlso, we need a Tinder-style app for food. Just swipe until there's a match."]}
