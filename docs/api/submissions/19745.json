While the majority of the NTA replies were reassuring to read, the most helpful ones were the NAHs and ESHs and even some YTAs.\r  \n\r  \nFirst things first, I feel I may have unintentionally cast my wife in a somewhat unfair light. She's far from the lazy, pampered princess some may have pictured. She's on her feet a fair bit, grabbing her own snacks, sipping water, and even tossing together some rice for our lunch now and then. She's really quite the team player around the house, always ready to lend a hand when she's feeling good. I often find myself encouraging her to kick back and rest.\r  \n\r  \nThe real pickle here wasn't about her helping out or not, but about her leaning on me to sort out all her meals. Reading all your comments, I had a bit of an \"aha\" moment - she genuinely didn't know what she felt like eating. And, to be totally transparent, this food decision deadlock isn't a new game for us. Pre-pregnancy, we'd often volley the \"No, you decide\" ball until one of us gave in. Now that we've got a baby on the way, I have realized it would be quite irresponsible of both of us to let her go hungry because she can't decide. While technically her responsibility to decide, I have taken up on following some advice here.\r  \n\r  \n(Quick tangent - have you ever noticed how different you can be from your partner in certain ways? Like, when I'm under the weather, I'm a big fan of sorting out my own needs - calling the doc, taking my meds, fetching my own hot water. My wife, though? She's all about caring and pampering, even when I'm barely sniffly. It's taken me a bit of time to get used to her high-level pampering expectations, but I'm getting there!)\r  \n\r  \nSo, following some solid advice from this community, I snagged \"Real Food for Pregnancy: The Science and Wisdom of Optimal Prenatal Nutrition\" and it's been quite an eye opener. I've shared the need-to-know parts with my wife (since reading makes her a tad nervous at the moment). We've come to realize we've been pretty off track with our nutrition. I told her we need to increase our protein consumption and have shared my plans on buying more meat and fish. I also started following the advice of just giving her food without asking what she wants - it actually works. Overall, I think this is making her feel that I care about her diet (and her) and our relationship has improved. I also feel pretty good about our diet now.\r  \n\r  \nIn a nutshell, we're making progress. She seems more at ease with our meal situation and I'm feeling pretty good about getting our nutrition on track.", "created_utc": 1686836521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14a2rwc/update_aita_for_not_preparing_my_pregnant_wife/", "score": 677, "replies": ["Oh, nice update!", "OP, especially now that you're going to be parents, you should both read this article about mental load:\n\nhttps://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/\n\nYou touched on this in your post, when you said it's too much to have to figure out the meals AND cook them. It's really important for couples to share this mental burden. (And as the kids grow, make sure you're not falling into a habit of letting mom take care of all the schedules and things, which often happens.)", "Good for you man. Way to take the initiative.", "One piece of advice i would give is don't put too much pressure on eating perfectly during pregnancy. Its obviously great to eat as healthily as possible, but sometimes its just as important to find something you can eat!\n\nBasically, use the knowledge you've gained to help with planning meals, but don't hold it up as a target to meet, that could just lead to unnecessary stress and guilt if its difficult to stick to.", "A good option when no one ever knows what they want to eat is either get a meal kit delivery service like Blue Apron or Hello Fresh, where you can basically tell them the nutrition profile you\u2019re going for and they send you pre portioned ingredients (usually a couple times a week) or, as that\u2019s pretty pricey, Meal prep yourself. There are a billion articles and videos, but essentially, you plan and do the prep work beforehand (sometimes up to a week in advance, sometimes a month or two), so that when you or your wife are hungry, the chopping and deciding are done. \n\nThis is a great system for crockpot recipes. I can often throw a whole meal together in under an hour (because I used to watch Chopped on the Food Network and would accept the challenge of making a meal with pretty much anything within reason) but for those times when I can\u2019t, I can grab a meal that\u2019s been pre-prepped for the crockpot (butter chicken, anyone?) and go on about my day. After 4-8 hours, meal\u2019s done and very little energy spent on food.", "Glad you are making progress.  WE have a family member and their wife have this same issue in regard to what do you want to eat.  We joked that we were going to get them a kids see n say and put food or restaurant names over each of the farm animals.  They can then pull the handle and what ever it lands on is what they do.  Never did it, but I think this gave them an idea of how annoying their indecision was to others.", "Yeah you working on your relationship like adults!!!!!!  Congrats!!", "The \"no I don't want that\" game.  We stopped that by putting everything we like on a slip of paper, put them in a hat and draw.  Whatever it is, that's what your having- period. (then put the slip back in the hat)", ">I also started following the advice of just giving her food without asking what she wants\n\n>this is making her feel that I care about her diet (and her)\n\nI have a family member who is dealing with severe anxiety and one of the things affected is their eating. Preparing food without asking them what they want has made things less stressful for everyone, and taking some trouble with the food and the presentation makes them feel loved. Glad this is working for you too \u2661", "This is a good update. One thing though is don\u2019t put too much pressure on her having the perfect diet. She may have cravings and that\u2019s ok too", "Aw! Sweet", "We use a meal kit delivery service, which is awesome, but very annoyingly has become something that triggers my nausea in pregnancy. Every time I consider eating or actually eat something from there I feel sick. And I'm through all my other morning sickness symptoms, so I think this one is intent on sticking around! \n\nHowever I totally agree, even outside of pregnancy these sort of kits are so good for just taking that mental load away.", "Could be a psychological thing! I was on the gluten challenge for a month and it got so bad last week even water repulsed me. My gastro told me I could stop the challenge Monday and now I\u2019m eating normally again. Your subconscious may be trying to protect you with that response. Maybe a different one (meal kit service) could break that barrier? It could be the visual cues of the box bc you used it during a time where you were sick a lot. \n\nAlso, maybe somehow have someone cook the food without you seeing the box. Our bodies can be very much like children in the way of assumptions and the level of drama with which they react. If it doesn\u2019t have a distinct aroma or anything, you may be able to remind your body that food\u2019s safe even if it comes in the scary box. \n\nHope that helps!", "Nice update. Something that works for me is low-key meal planning. Usually on Fridays during happy hour, I draft a list of dinners that would be good for the following week. That helps me figure out what I want to buy at the Saturday farmer\u2019s market. Then every night after dinner I make a final decision about the next night\u2019s dinner. Maybe I follow the plan I made on Friday, and maybe I don\u2019t. But at least I don\u2019t need to start with a blank page every single day. \n\nI also keep a list of whatever unused fresh ingredients we have on hand. It minimizes waste and also makes meal planning more interesting as I solve the puzzle of how to use up the leftover half cup of coconut milk.", "I was one of the formerly pregnant people who suggested to just put food in front of her because she probably literally didn't know what she wanted. I'm glad it's working out!", "... why does reading make her nervous? That seems like an excuse.", "Glad this turned out well!", "Heck yeah bro it\u2019s always good to see two people love eachother enough to be humble and learn and change.", "Thanks for the update! I considered you NTA, but I love that you were open to the criticism from other votes and learned from it.", "When people are stressed out, decision paralysis and executive function disorders become a problem. Basically \"I'm already dealing with the big issues of X,Y, and Z, so I don't have the headspace for question/issue A.\" Limiting options can definitely be helpful. Usually adults can handle an open-ended question like \"What do you want for dinner?\" But in times of stress, if someone offers \"I'm making [blank] for dinner tonight. Do you want some?\" or \"I was thinking of ordering from place X or place Y. Does one of those sound better?\" it can really ease the burden for the person who's struggling.\n\nAlso, we need a Tinder-style app for food. Just swipe until there's a match.", "I remember reading your AITA. Thank you for the update!\n\nThis made me smile today and I needed to smile.", "This is an awesome update and my favourite kind of 'maybe I was a bit of AH in this situation'.  Understanding how people see things differently and learning from a different perspective.\n\nGreat stuff man.", "*Applause*. Great update!", "Sounds like you've had a positive resolution, and I'm really happy for you, OP! \n\nI'm currently pregnant and it's been tough for my wife & I to figure out the food situation, too. It's not as easy as some folks think, especially when you're feeling sick, having cravings, and dealing with dietary restrictions all while trying to have good nutrition practices. \n\nGlad you found an informative book. There are also some apps, like Flo, that have built in nutrition advice in their pregnancy tracking feature. Best wishes.", "This. I have degrees in biology and medicine and while you def need some vital nutrients, humans have been subsisting on super varied and imperfect diets for millennia.", "Junk food is better than no food (well\u2026 I mean in a lot of cases anyway)", "Related to the mental load thing:\n\nMy partner and I are also dreadful at picking dinner.  We've had the worst vulture moments ever (So what do you want to do?  I don't know, what do you want to do?) and we developed a strategy that has worked really well for us.\n\nOnce a week, we plan the entire week's menu.  He plans a minimum of 2 items and I do the rest (It stresses him out more than me, so the mental load is equally shared even though it might not seem like it).  Then the rest of the week is easy - shopping lists and dinner are taken care of all at once and actual items can be shifted around for moods and time as necessary.  We also keep old lists for reference, which makes things easier on top of that.", "Yep, I personally am not a fan of one person figuring out and a different person cooking. It's so much more restful to have days COMPLETELY off. So make cooking/planning one chore and trade off on that chore. No one should have to do it 100% of the time but it's much more fulfilling to set things up so when you **do** do it, you're completely responsible.", "For anyone who is struggling with cooking, I really recommend doing a meal kit delivery service for just a couple of months, and holding on to all the recipe cards that you like. It gets the ball rolling, puts you in the right habits, without having you feel overwhelmed by choice. Even when you cancel the service you will still have only 20 recipe options to choose from instead of the millions that you get when you google \"recipe ideas\", so you save yourself the analysis paralysis.", "I wonder if it\u2019s because reading pregnancy and baby related books makes her overwhelmed. It can be too much information, and make mom to be feel like unless they\u2019re perfect, they\u2019re a failure.", "That was my question too", "Unrelated but I\u2019m SO GLAD I\u2019m not the only one who hears those vultures in their head when trying to figure out dinner with their partner lol", "I was about to post that meal planning is a great way to get around the \"what do you fancy for dinner?\" conundrum. I keep mine on a Google Sheets document and have it laid out as a calendar, so I can see what we'll be eating on week 1 in January, and February, and March etc.\n\nDoesn't mean we can't get a takeaway or change it if we fancy something different etc, but it takes out a lot of the indecision and makes food shopping much easier too!", "This, so much this. Bonus it\u2019s saved my wife and I a ton of money because then we don\u2019t get takeout as often. We plan the meals, plan who is cooking them (although ~1/2 of the meals in our rotation are just sort of default my responsibility because I like cooking them and she isn\u2019t comfortable doing more involved cooking) and plan which day we will eat them on to the best of our abilities. Obviously we can\u2019t stick to the schedule every week but it\u2019s so nice to be wondering what we are doing for dinner and then realize I can just check the calendar.", "Another vulture one here! In my friend group it was hard for us to decide what to eat. It was three guys and two girls with me being one of the girls lol. My girl friend and I would decide in the class we had together before lunch what we were having to avoid this problem.", "That's basically what we do too! It's so we know what to buy for the week", "Yup! We do this too and have it on a week whiteboard by the kitchen. Helps us make sure our week is balanced and keeps my husband from asking \"what's for dinner tonight\".", "We do this too! My kids are old enough now that they each choose a meal for one day a week and I only have to pick one or two each week. And they are having to help me make the meal they choose, so they are learning how to cook, bonus! My oldest has a few things he can prepare on his own now and it\u2019s awesome", "My wife and I have this thing we call \"Pick one or eliminate one.\" If we can't decide on dinner, one of us will propose three different restaurants. So let's say I propose a Mexican place, an Italian place, and a steak joint. If she picks one, that's where we go for dinner. If she eliminates one, then I choose one of the remaining two. We take turns as to who proposes the restaurants, and who picks or eliminates.", "Tinder-style menu planning is brilliant! There can be a free option that gets pretty random, and with the paid you can filter more by ingredients you already have on hand!", "\u201cDon\u2019t start that again\u201d lololol", "My late husband would just EAT HOT POCKETS. Like would even prefer them over a nice steak.", "Nice! That sounds like a solid system.", "We\u2019ve started trending that way in my household, as well. We\u2019re getting really bad with \u201cI dunno, what do you want?\u201d and after the recurring stressful days at work, I\u2019m just frustrated with feeling like I ALSO have to be in charge of picking out dinner. Give me a direction, because otherwise I\u2019m going to eat Italian sandwiches for the next three weeks. \n\nThree is a good starting point, and whittles down easily. We should look to formalizing that method a little more, I think that would stress me out less. :-)", "Interesting. Thanks for the tips! I'm in charge of the app where we order and check what order we need to eat the meals in etc. And I think that might be whats triggering it. So maybe I need to suggest my partner downloads the app!"]}
