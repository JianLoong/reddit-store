It also matters how old this kid is; if he's like 18 months, that's developmentally normal, if he's like four years old, screaming like that is a sign of bad parenting.", "NTA \n\nGood luck up there.  Let us know which happens first: you lose your hearing, or the kid loses his voice.", "NTA. I've been the mom with the screaming kid, and believe me, I would do literally anything to get them to stop.", "Normally I would say y w b t a h, sometimes kids cry on a plane and sometimes there is nothing you can do about it. Parents can be overwhelmed with dealing with kids as well. It is a struggle. However, I do think you do whatever you can to try and soothe them to help keep them calm. If the kid is screaming for cocomelon let them watch on the plane. Also, could be depending on age of the child, if they are too young (1-3) to fully process the situation then make teaching moments at other times, not a plane full of people. \n\nHowever, if the kid is old enough to know that they are being disruptive just to get their way then I can see why a parent might be reluctant.  \n\nIt also could be due to the cost and the excuse is they need to learn to live without it.\n\nIF you choose to discuss it with the parent, I\u2019d do it as kindly as possible while also somehow so the kid doesn\u2019t hear or know, especially if you offer to pay. Like\u2026\n\u201cI understand you want to teach your child patience and coping without certain things. However, this is a confined space and many others are affected by their unhappiness over being unable to watch cocomelon. So, it would be appreciated if you could consider holding off on this teaching moment. It would be appreciated. If the cost of internet is an issue, I\u2019d be happy to cover it for you.\u201d \n\nThey may react negatively to your request, so be prepared to deal with it. \n\nNot sure I can give clear judgement. Because as I said kids cry and sometimes that\u2019s just being a kid. However, parents should make the effort to calm them on a full plane. Not exacerbate the issue.\n\nETA: maybe add in you understand how difficult it can be to travel with young kids and you are just wanting to make things easier for them\u2026 or something.", "I give my kid anything on a flight. Like 5cc of Benadryl.", "NTA", "What the hell is sussing?", "Good luck!\n\nPerhaps you could suggest you and her swap seats for a short break.

The mom should do better at shutting him up though, but not necessarily to put up with the demand. I wonder how she will deal with him throughout the flight for sure. It's inconsiderate to allow your child scream for so long in public.\n\nEdit to add: I am in no way disagreeing that the mom needs to control and quiet the child, nor do I think OP can't complain. I'm just saying they should not openly tell the mom how to deal with the kid, especially not tell her to cave in to the kid's demand in front of the kid as he will learn that if he is annoying enough, other people will help him pressure the mom to do what he wants.", "NAH\n\nI find kids melting down on planes awesome.

You should not undermine her in front of her toddler like that. It's an 8 hour flight but it's only been 20 min, she still has time to calm toddler down.

Plus (though rare) emergencies can happen where the plane crew need to get everyone\u2019s attention quickly and get them to follow orders for everyone\u2019s safety. Even on a bus/train, you can get off at an early stop, or other passengers can get off early if they can\u2019t take the situation.\n\nSo for all parents I know, planes are a special zone (with lots of pre-planning, ideally exercising to tire kid out before flight, special stash of \u201cnew\u201d books/small toys from the dollar store or specific favorite snacks to be pulled out at intervals.

He'd have already learned it doesn't work.  Even if parenting is consistent, it's likely that the kid may be overstimulated, exhausted, or just not feeling good.  Sometimes you make exceptions.", "This problem started at home. You're right that this mom isn't consistent with her parenting.", "You keep parenting consistent but remain aware of what fights you\u2019re setting yourself up for. She didn\u2019t have to say no to coco melon at this exact moment but once she did she was obligated to follow through. Clearly her kid is allowed to watch cocomelon at other times so for her this is an issue of how long he\u2019s watching cocomelon which is basically more an issue of him listening to her when she says no more. Kids aren\u2019t great with a sense of time he\u2019s not learning how long he\u2019s allowed to watch it just that no means no. So in this situation it\u2019s best to avoid contradicting yourself by just\u2026 not saying no, especially when there isn\u2019t a reason to say no. If the kid was crying because she made him stop climbing over the seats this would be unfortunate but she HAD to say no in that situation and deal with the tantrum.

As a result, this behavior is only going to increase and take LONGER to wean/extinct. \n\nIf she were at home, she could redirect to another activity. If she were at home, she could actually employ planned ignoring in a way where it would be successful (if the child has nowhere to go/no alternative to being ignored, planned ignoring doesn\u2019t work out the same.) Even if she\u2019s the worst fuckin parent on the planet, if she were at home she could lock all of the devices in a cabinet and lock herself in her room to ignore him.\n\nThere is no control or true ability to manipulate the situation in a public place such as a plane.

He's screaming cause it works. Your impulse to tell her to give in is the proof. I think YBTA if you said something. It completely sucks to be on the plane with that kid, I was on one yesterday with a miserable toddler, but she knows. She knows this is horrible, she knows people are judging her, she wants it to stop. She has her reasons, you don't know why she's on the plane or what she's going through, or whether she planned to do this behaviour change at home but somebody died or got sick or her travel companion couldn't come or something else, or why she's trying to ween him off it (pediatrician recommendations? speech development? something upcoming?) that makes her need to stick to her guns.
