It also matters how old this kid is; if he's like 18 months, that's developmentally normal, if he's like four years old, screaming like that is a sign of bad parenting.", "NTA \n\nGood luck up there.  Let us know which happens first: you lose your hearing, or the kid loses his voice.", "NTA. I've been the mom with the screaming kid, and believe me, I would do literally anything to get them to stop.", "Normally I would say y w b t a h, sometimes kids cry on a plane and sometimes there is nothing you can do about it. Parents can be overwhelmed with dealing with kids as well. It is a struggle. However, I do think you do whatever you can to try and soothe them to help keep them calm. If the kid is screaming for cocomelon let them watch on the plane. Also, could be depending on age of the child, if they are too young (1-3) to fully process the situation then make teaching moments at other times, not a plane full of people. \n\nHowever, if the kid is old enough to know that they are being disruptive just to get their way then I can see why a parent might be reluctant.  \n\nIt also could be due to the cost and the excuse is they need to learn to live without it.\n\nIF you choose to discuss it with the parent, I\u2019d do it as kindly as possible while also somehow so the kid doesn\u2019t hear or know, especially if you offer to pay. Like\u2026\n\u201cI understand you want to teach your child patience and coping without certain things. However, this is a confined space and many others are affected by their unhappiness over being unable to watch cocomelon. So, it would be appreciated if you could consider holding off on this teaching moment. It would be appreciated. If the cost of internet is an issue, I\u2019d be happy to cover it for you.\u201d \n\nThey may react negatively to your request, so be prepared to deal with it. \n\nNot sure I can give clear judgement. Because as I said kids cry and sometimes that\u2019s just being a kid. However, parents should make the effort to calm them on a full plane. Not exacerbate the issue.\n\nETA: maybe add in you understand how difficult it can be to travel with young kids and you are just wanting to make things easier for them\u2026 or something.", "I give my kid anything on a flight. Like 5cc of Benadryl.", "NTA", "What the hell is sussing?", "Good luck!\n\nPerhaps you could suggest you and her swap seats for a short break.

The mom should do better at shutting him up though, but not necessarily to put up with the demand. I wonder how she will deal with him throughout the flight for sure. It's inconsiderate to allow your child scream for so long in public.\n\nEdit to add: I am in no way disagreeing that the mom needs to control and quiet the child, nor do I think OP can't complain. I'm just saying they should not openly tell the mom how to deal with the kid, especially not tell her to cave in to the kid's demand in front of the kid as he will learn that if he is annoying enough, other people will help him pressure the mom to do what he wants.", "NAH\n\nI find kids melting down on planes awesome.

It really is little things that can make the best childhood memories(or the worst).", "I agree so much with this! \n\nBut I think the mom has never stood her grounds (based on the 1,5 hour, this kid definitely expects a reward for screaming) and she chose this moment to start and show a bunch of strangers she's a 'responsible mom'", "OP has the right to say something to the mother, and the reasonable expectation that the mother will do as much as she can, within reason, to quiet her child. I know that sometimes kids scream, and there is nothing you can do, but that wasn\u2019t the case here.\n\nThere is this thing called a social contract, which is \u201can implicit agreement among the members of a society to cooperate for social benefits.\u201d If one member of society is breaking the social contract by letting her offspring scream for hours on end, then the other members of society have the right to bring it to that person\u2019s attention. The deal is that I will keep my opinions to myself, unless your behavior is directly affecting me, at which point, you lost the privilege of me keeping my mouth shut. If you break the social contract first, then you can\u2019t expect others to stick to it. \n\nEx: I used to feed my kids dumdums to keep them quiet when we would fly. I\u2019d pack a giant bag. Sometimes other parents/passengers would look at me in disgust for giving my kids all that sugar, but they didn\u2019t have a right to say anything because my parenting choice wasn\u2019t affecting them. Now, if my kids were kicking their seats and acting crazy bc of a sugar high, then that\u2019s different bc now they are being affected by my parenting choice.

I hope the bad fade into the ether.", "Bro what? I'm pretty sure I'm entitled to not have my ears cried off. Human decency would be making sure your kid doesn't cry the entire fight and disturb everyone else. Putting yourself ahead of everyone else on the plane is selfish.", "NTA \n\nThis was my parenting rule: Never give into tantrums, EXCEPT in airports/planes. In those places ALWAYS give into tantrums as soon as possible. If you give in very quickly, the kid might not even realise they got their way through throwing a tantrum, they might think they made a reasonable request. It worked for me.", "I had to stop cocomelon for my kid because it was making her a zombie. I DID NOT choose a plane full of people and no distractions to start telling herb not more cocomelon.

You're completely in the right.", "NTA\n\nYou have to know which battles to fight as a parent", "NAH, flying is hard and kids are hard.", "NTA.  She should have just given the kid the tablet.  You don't expect your toddler to sit there quiet like an adult for that amount of time.  She needs to be a better parent because if I said that to my mother, I wouldn't be alive today to even say this.", "We've been pretty strict parents to our kids, and there have been times when we've refused things to them ... but a plane ride is not it.  A plane ride is when you have lots of snacks, including more treats than you would normally have, lots of fun and exciting activities, and stuff for them to watch. A plane ride is NOT the time to restrict screen time.\n\nThere are just some times when rules need to be thrown out, and being in a plane is one of them.", "NTA I would have pulled up some c-melon clips on youtube for the little guy lmao", "Unfortunately he now learned that screaming for 1 1/2 hours will get you your way. \n \n\nI taught my kids that different rules apply for travel, but also that screaming won't get you things, but nice words might. Once they were old enough they would get to watch videos after one hour of being nice and quiet with books, painting supplies etc, or I would play a game with them. No screaming in the car or on planes.\n\nThis mom is useless.\n\nNTA though.", "The problem is not so much her not giving in, but her escalating or prolonging the situation by making it into a power struggle. In general, it is easy to divert a toddler's attention, she should have done so from the beginning.\n\nYou are definitely not the asshole by asking a mother to treat her toddler properly so that he or she will not scream in plane... Unfortunatly, there are too many parents who don't know how to go about it.\n\nMaybe you could start flirting with the toddler and getting him interested in something...\n\nPS: I understood cocomelons was sugary treat. Turns out it is a video. So here I agree with those who say a plane is not the playe to start your weaning process.. because if the toddler is addicted - well he can stay addicted during the flight and they can start weaning after wards...", "Plot twist -- after a few minutes the *mom* starts to cry because she doesn't have her small screen opiate of choice if the kid has it. \n\nNTA... But it would not have gone well.", "NTA. Sounds like the kid needs to watch [Bluey](https://www.youtube.com/@BlueyOfficialChannel), not whatever the hell coco melon is.\n\nEdit: A quick google shows me this is YouTube Baby crack.", "NTA the fact that this kid would cry and scream for 1.5 hours before the parent gave in is evidence that they've done this before and it has escalated to this point. \n\nIt takes a lot of energy and dedication to cry for so long. If the parent had been limiting screen time leading up to this and not giving in I don't think the kid would have been able to hold out for so long. I'm thinking they knew eventually they would get it if they just kept screaming like they have in the past. \n\nWeaning from something is not delaying when you give in to the demand. That's training for marathon tantrums. Weaning is setting expectations ahead of time and keeping in accordance with them. 30 minutes of screen time means 30 minutes period and screaming for more wouldn't change it. \n\nOn a plane though. Do what you have to to keep them quiet.", "OP NTA and I am truly sorry to read your peace and quiet got ruined no thanks to mum.

Just a half hour of nothing to do is a nightmare!", "Honestly coco melon is literal crack for toddlers and the most mind numbing show I have ever seen. You don\u2019t go cold turkey on a 8 hour flight! My advice is never ever let them see it. Then you won\u2019t have to ensure the utter crap that is that creepy toddler and his lobotomised family. It also clearly has no educational value as observed when my nephew smacked his cousin for \u201clooking at the screen\u201d during the song about sharing\u2026", "Agreed but as a teacher I find the real sin to be that she ultimately gave in. If the kid is ND, austistic especially, it can only take a couple times of doing this to ingrain a behavior of ceaseless and desperate pursuit. She should have known she wasn\u2019t in a situation to outwait him and stopped fighting the battle within minutes if even starting it at all. \n\nCoco melon is crack, I hope my son never learns it exists. Also I think we should be considerate that the mom might have a ND kid but she\u2019s still doing a pretty bad job so, eh\u2026.", "Right, I\u2019m not keen on screen time, but We bought our 4 year old a switch for our flights and it was the best parenting choice I have ever made.", "To be fair, cocomelon is like crack for kids. It's designed to keep them hooked. Each frame is on the screen for 2-3 seconds max before switching. That being said, I agree and would have put bluey on instead", "Yeah, why the fuck would she pick an 8 hour flight (when you've already had to shuffle a toddler through an airport) as the time to try to make him live without Cocomelon? I thought the whole strategy to traveling with kids was try to distract them as much as possible.", "I wonder if she was offering him alternatives and engaging with him or just sitting there in her phone.", "We will, she didn't engage the child in any alternative activities. She should have read a book, play a game, do a puzzle, play together with his toys. She was lazy and will stay lazy.", "I can understand the principle, although not the right time and place,  but did she offer alternatives?

The relationship between violence in video games and aggression in kids is really hazy, but the research is starting to point to kids who already have higher aggression *seek out* those kinds of games (which may then in turn increase their aggression, since they get to play it out so often). Kids with normal levels of aggression don't seem as affected by violent games.\n\n(Only sharing because I think it's fascinating.
