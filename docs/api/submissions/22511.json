It also matters how old this kid is; if he's like 18 months, that's developmentally normal, if he's like four years old, screaming like that is a sign of bad parenting.", "NTA \n\nGood luck up there.  Let us know which happens first: you lose your hearing, or the kid loses his voice.", "NTA. I've been the mom with the screaming kid, and believe me, I would do literally anything to get them to stop.", "Normally I would say y w b t a h, sometimes kids cry on a plane and sometimes there is nothing you can do about it. Parents can be overwhelmed with dealing with kids as well. It is a struggle. However, I do think you do whatever you can to try and soothe them to help keep them calm. If the kid is screaming for cocomelon let them watch on the plane. Also, could be depending on age of the child, if they are too young (1-3) to fully process the situation then make teaching moments at other times, not a plane full of people. \n\nHowever, if the kid is old enough to know that they are being disruptive just to get their way then I can see why a parent might be reluctant.  \n\nIt also could be due to the cost and the excuse is they need to learn to live without it.\n\nIF you choose to discuss it with the parent, I\u2019d do it as kindly as possible while also somehow so the kid doesn\u2019t hear or know, especially if you offer to pay. Like\u2026\n\u201cI understand you want to teach your child patience and coping without certain things. However, this is a confined space and many others are affected by their unhappiness over being unable to watch cocomelon. So, it would be appreciated if you could consider holding off on this teaching moment. It would be appreciated. If the cost of internet is an issue, I\u2019d be happy to cover it for you.\u201d \n\nThey may react negatively to your request, so be prepared to deal with it. \n\nNot sure I can give clear judgement. Because as I said kids cry and sometimes that\u2019s just being a kid. However, parents should make the effort to calm them on a full plane. Not exacerbate the issue.\n\nETA: maybe add in you understand how difficult it can be to travel with young kids and you are just wanting to make things easier for them\u2026 or something.", "I give my kid anything on a flight. Like 5cc of Benadryl.", "NTA", "What the hell is sussing?", "Good luck!\n\nPerhaps you could suggest you and her swap seats for a short break.

Weren't you about to watch Cocomelon on your phone????", "I don't know how to feel about this, to be honest.  We get judged for every single damn thing.  nah. She's trying to stand her ground so her kid doesn't just cry for cocomelon and then you judge her when she gives it to them.", "YWBTA but depending on how things go, it could change.\n\nInitial thought is mind your own business and ask for earplugs if you need it.\n\nBut the kid is around 2-3 yo? The mom should do better at shutting him up though, but not necessarily to put up with the demand. I wonder how she will deal with him throughout the flight for sure. It's inconsiderate to allow your child scream for so long in public.\n\nEdit to add: I am in no way disagreeing that the mom needs to control and quiet the child, nor do I think OP can't complain. I'm just saying they should not openly tell the mom how to deal with the kid, especially not tell her to cave in to the kid's demand in front of the kid as he will learn that if he is annoying enough, other people will help him pressure the mom to do what he wants.", "NAH\n\nI find kids melting down on planes awesome.

Telling her how to calm the kid down is out of line and probably going to make the kid worse.", "YWBTA contrary to other people's comments. You should not undermine her in front of her toddler like that. It's an 8 hour flight but it's only been 20 min, she still has time to calm toddler down. If she gives in, she is essentially teaching the toddler that being persistently loud and annoying will work and toddler will do it everywhere and anywhere. Let mummy figure out or for herself, she doesn't need a redditor offering her 5 bucks for WiFi.", "Yta. Crying kids are a known thing on airplanes, it\u2019s not your place to tell a parent how to parent.
