Something very similar happened to me about 20 years ago. I was disowned by my grandfather; aunts, uncles and cousins I was previously close with followed his lead. I just had my parents and that was enough. As soon as my grandfather and I made up a decade later, everyone was cool with me again, but the damage was done. I don\u2019t go home often, and I message them on FB, but we don\u2019t spend holidays together. Some things can\u2019t be fixed.
