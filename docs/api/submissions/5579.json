Your family is gaslighting you.\n\nKeep your own plans. If you think their drama is bad now, it will only be worse if you give in to their manipulation & go.\n\nIt's great that you've made up, but when you smash a plate on the floor & glue it back together, the cracks are still there, no matter how much you apologize to the plate, or wish you hadn't smashed it on the floor.\n\nThat they're trying to pressure & guilt you is just gross IMO. Leave them to each other & enjoy your Sunday without them. HTH", "When your father \u201cdisowned you\u201d he relieved you of any ethical duty to them. Also, if it mattered that much they could offer to pay for the flight or really show they cared by visiting you and apologizing. Enjoy your holiday guilt free!", "NTA. You don't owe anybody an explanation yet you gave the real reason when you were pressed. If your mom is embarrassed that other people heard you say that then it's her own fault for putting you on speaker without alerting you.", "NTA. Holidays are an even more necessary time to set boundaries and protect yourself. You\u2019ll see them soon, you\u2019re not saying never.", "NTA. Even when you've come to terms with trauma it doesn't mean it can't hurt you. It's good you mended your relationship with your dad (though, you didn't have to), but that doesn't mean his words didn't hurt you and haunt you to this day. \n\nIt's easy for someone outside of that to just say grow a pair and deal with it, but if it's that hurtful to you to where you feel like every Christmas is a reminder of that day, then you don't have to participate. \n\nAlso you didn't mean to out your dad like that, you thought it was a private 1 on 1 so nobody can say you were saying it just to be mean.", "NTA", "NTA.

You can see them another time. There's nothing wrong with your father hearing how much that fight continues to affect you.", "Hardest NTA.\nMy parents disowned me this May for being gay, and birthdays and Christmas have been incredibly hard this year, but I can't even imagine how it could feel being done on Christmas. The whole tree-music-gifts stuff supposed to set the festive mood might trigger trauma for you years after the reconciliation.\n\nI am very sorry for you, and you have every right to do whatever works for you to minimise the pain. \n\nYour feelings matter. Your being hurt is real and valid, and whatever you do to get through this triggering is good, and your family are the last people in the world to challenge your choices of actions here. You have already been too kind by inventing a polite reason you can't come. It is good they know the truth. If your dad is hurt - he deserves this because this is a possibility for him to look into your reality, into the consequences of what he did.", "NTA", ">I should suck it up and quit making it about me. \n\nYou're not \"making' it about you it *is* about you. They're trying to make it about them. You have every right to be hurt by this and not be okay celebrating that day with him. Have you had a direct conversation with your father about how much this hurt you? \n\nNTA", "NTA. It's very hard to get over the rejection of a parent and you're not there yet, 100%. You have s good relationship with him but that doesn't mean the scars have totally healed yet. No one can force you to visit them and who cares if he overheard you? It's the truth! If he cant handle the truth he should have been a better father to you 5 years ago.", "NTA. If your dad didn't want anyone to know about it, he shouldn't have done it. He can't ask for forgiveness while simultaneously refusing to take responsibility for his actions.", "NTA, and frankly, it's a good thing that your father and grandmother overheard.  They needed to hear very clearly that you were deeply hurt.\n\nYour siblings suck for trying to make this your fault.  This action on their part is predictable -- but it is designed to preserve the status quo, and it may well prevent any growth on the part of your father (and perhaps your grandmother).  But that's on them, and not on you.\n\nGood for you for creating your own rituals.  That's what I've done to replace the ones I lost.  I also recommend a bit of therapy, just to help you recognize the dysfunction in your family, and to uphold the healthy boundaries you're putting in place for yourself.\n\nI'm sending my best wishes your way!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
