He wanted people to know that he was rich enough to buy a Rolex for a birthday gift. Plus who buys watches for their GF on back-to-back birthdays?!", "NTA. Why watches two birthdays in a row? Is there a street vendor who sells knockoffs near his office or something?", "NTA you repeatedly told him you didn't want one before he bought it for you. He bought it for himself, not for you. It's not like he got you a $50 watch, that thing is probably $500-$5,000. Return that shit and buy a trip together.", "Umm yes YTA - Rolex are stupid expense and when ordered, they take 3-5 YEARS to make. I get that he's consistent in his gift giving but you could keep it and sell it for a profit later. Rolex sells at MARKET VALUE - not suggested retail. Depending on the model, you could net $10k. He gifted you an investment, not just a piece of wearable craftsmanship. \n\nClearly you should do your research before you act like a spoiled brat.", "NTA - Sell the watch.  Return the boyfriend, who's a hard-head who doesn't listen to you at all.", "NTA, If he didn't hint and get your opinion then YTA because you should be grateful for any gift.

That's way too pricey a gift to get for someone you know for a fact doesn't want it.", "I think the only way to teach him a lesson is to give that watch to a stranger. A stranger in need, one who sits by the window watching the water droplets collect and trail down, wishing life was just a little bit better.

He\u2019s already gotten you a watch, you\u2019ve told him you don\u2019t want a watch, you have an Apple Watch. Why he insisted on this despite all evidence saying you wouldn\u2019t like is anyone\u2019s guess. However, my guess is that he had an easy way to get you this particular item and, because it\u2019s expensive and showy, cluelessly thought he could make it look like he put a lot of effort into a low-effort gift or that you\u2019d be wearing it and telling others he got it for you (implying he did a lot). He\u2019s probably sulking because he can\u2019t easily return the watch and/or when you go to pick out something together you\u2019ll probably realize there isn\u2019t much else that\u2019s the value of a Rolex that you can exchange this gift for. \n\nI think you should ask him why he got you something you clearly stated you didn\u2019t want in a gentle way. Ask him to help you understand his thought process and to share if there is anything significant about this watch (it\u2019s what his father have his mother for a birthday early on, it\u2019s a family heirloom, etc.). If he tells you he just felt like getting you a Rolex then you\u2019re going to want to decide if he\u2019s laughably bad with gifts or bad at listening or if something else is going on.", "NTA\n\nYou've made it very clear to him that you don't wear watches.\n\nIt seems like he's buying gifts more for himself than for you. He's not even taking your personal style, wrist size, jewelry type, etc. into account when getting the watches.", "Lol.

You should appreciate that he even got you a gift - and an expensive gift at that. Return it & find something you will wear.", "NTA.

There are a few used ones in the $3k range but they will have flaws and won't be desirable models...  $5000 doesn't buy a new Rolex and only buys a few used ones.", "Nah she said multiple times she didn\u2019t want it. He clearly doesn\u2019t listen", "So they should be happy that their boyfriend ignored their explicitly stated wishes because they might be able to sell the gift later, for profit? That take is... certainly unique. Most people don't judge the quality of a gift by how much they could resell it for.", "And she didn\u2019t want any of that and repeatedly told him that. Is that so difficult to understand?", "If she's already told him she doesn't like or want watches before (which she said she had in the post when he hinted at it) then she is within her rights to not be nice or grateful to someone who has blatantly ignored her feelings and wishes.", "NTA agree with above but I\u2019d wait to have the larger conversation about gifting until after this has been returned & things have settled down. Frankly I\u2019d just make an Amazon list of gift ideas for the future & tell him not to go rogue.", "Yeah, like most of the \u201ccheap\u201d watches there are 10k and the popular models put you on a waiting list for years. The second hand versions of the popular models cost more than the original price.\n\nI know someone who\u2019s family members OWNS a Rolex store and he had to wait 12 months for his watch.

Consequences.", "A gift should be thoughtful and meaningful.  \nShe said she didn't want a watch AND doesn't wear the last one he got her.  \nHe didn't buy her a Rolex because he thought she wanted one, he bought her one she he could tell people \"I got my GF a Rolex\"  \nThis has the Homer wants a bowling ball, so buys one for Marge for her Birthday, written all over it.  \nOP NTA.", "Oooh can you find this or remember the title?", "shit, even worse.", "I didn\u2019t skip it. Again, it was a gift. He could have gotten her nothing.", "And ultimately, it\u2019s still a gift. How many people get gifts that are just kind of there?

Rolex have a HUGE resale market. If it's actually real, just keep it. When you and the boy eventually fizzle out bc he doesn't actually listen to what you want/care about, you can sell it to get first/last/security on your next apt.\n\nAltho he might just be embarrassed to take it to a jeweler with you bc it's fake. Maybe he just wanted to LOOK like a baller.", "NTA. I see some comments saying you're ungrateful, but I don't see it that way. Best case scenario, he's incredibly oblivious and thoughtless about your preferences. But since he doesn't have a Rolex, it seems to me that he was hoping that you'd just let him keep the watch for himself. \n\nIt's important that people, you know, actually like and use their gifts. And rule #1 in buying jewelry and other accessories is to make sure the metal matches the rest of their jewelry. Buying you something you don't want isn't thoughtful or generous.", "100% it is a fake / knock off watch.

It\u2019s infuriating because it shows they don\u2019t value what you tell them at all - and it\u2019s usually a gift that suits them not you.\n\nI find it\u2019s often expensive gifts too. I think sometimes they feel bad buying it for themselves so they buy it as a gift. They imagine the other person will actually feel super grateful even if they have no interest in the item, but they can now feel good about buying it. That\u2019s my experience anyway.", "NTA.

As if he\u2019s doing a big favor to you and you should be thankful.", "This is weird, to get someone something they don't want, especially if they don't have it for themselves. Also, spending valuable money on non-smart-watches seems dumb, pun intended. \n\nNTA, at least you were honest... what did he expect?", "Why do they do this? It boils my blood. For my birthday I asked my husband for a SPECIFIC sweater and cap. I sent him pictures, links and showed it to him multiple times. He got me shoes. Yes, I also wished for those shoes, it was a pair of Sketchers and I sent it to my family so they could buy it for me together. It would have been $20-25 per couple, and I didn't think that was too much to ask for. They got me something else, he got me those shoes, and I never got that sweater and caps\ud83d\ude02 NTA.

That\u2019s a very necessary information for you to have in order to understand and proceed.", "NTA. You told him you didn\u2019t want a Rolex and had no use for one before he bought it. Why is he completely ignoring what you told him? You aren\u2019t ungrateful at all. It is better to be honest and ask him to return it rather than it sitting in a drawer for years not being used.", "NTA, but has he also tried giving you a Peloton?", "Wait is this the girlfriend of the guy who had the watch obsession and kept buying his girlfriend watches she didn't want and was wondering why she was mad at him?", "NTA\n\nIf that's not your taste and you told him that, he should have listened. Also argue that it's a very expensive gift and it's a lot of wasted money for something you don't want.\n\nAlso: are you two made of money?", "NTA... when it comes to costly gifts that you dont like, it's not good to fake it. Better to exchange.", "NTA\n\nThink he is trying to build purchase history so the shop will sell him the actual one that he wants.", "NTA but not smart either. Think about it as an investment, Rolex can resale really high. I would have kept it even tho I never wear watches.", "What I usually look for in giving a gift is essentially 2 things. \n\n\n first and foremost, stuff pertaining to hints I received, if any, and/or something I strongly think they would enjoy. \n\nAnd then\n\n\nSomething that is more than what you think that person would spend on a similar item, and/or something  I enjoy, of course, assuming rule 1 is in effect and i think theu would enjoy it too. \n\n\nMy aunt still talks about this expensive pillow I bought her like 3 Christmases ago. Last Christmas, I went and bought like 9 pairs of hey dude footwear for every family member I would be seeing for the festivities, because I've worn through like a pair every spring and summer for the past few years. \n\n\nThe BF must have missed OP saying they didn't want a watch? Or like other I've read, stolen item, huge discount or getting on the \"preferred customer\" bender list? What if it turned out he got gifts mixed up with another girl he was seeing?!\n\nGotta say, id be all for either \n\n1) Like someone else said. Keeping it, as well as paying close attention to see if he disregards your thoughts and wishes going forward, and thinking back if things like this have surfaced before, and selling it if you're dissatisfied with the relationship. \n\nOr \n\n2) what OP has already done, requesting to take it back, and picking out orher stuff. This seems reasonable for someone they obviously care for, and if it hasn't been or continue to be a regular occurrence, and this tantrum isn't drawn out for a long period of time. \n\n\nIf he is really dragging it out and making a thing of it for a long time, I would definitely be leaning towards option 1.\n\n\nEdit: NAH. Good on you for being concise and transparent in what your needs and wants are.", "NTA, normally I would say that you should never be ungrateful for any gift but on this occasion you made it abundantly clear what not to buy you & yet he went ahead & did it again.", "NTA - is your BF the guy that collects watches and is using you as an excuse to grow his collection? If so, sympathies. If not, comments to him still apply. A gift that you know the recipant doesn't want but you do or you feel they should have one is no gift at all.", "NTA. Damn that is an expensive gift and such a waste to give to someone who specifically said they didn\u2019t want it. I\u2019d rather have my SO get me an expensive handbag with that money, since that\u2019s what I like.", "NTA. A few years ago, when I was 15-16 I had a bf with many issues, one of them was financial irresponsibility. He would get money from his mother and blow it on stuff he didn\u2019t need and crap gifts for me. Worse is his mother encouraged or even helped him get me gifts I didn\u2019t need or want at all. One time they even made a scene at a restaurant because they started pulling out jewelry to give me and I, embarrassed, put my foot down. To me that says your boyfriend is similarly 1. childish and immature about money, 2. cares more about a temporary ego boost than listening to your wants/needs.", "NTA. There's not a lot of info here, and he seems to have an odd obsession with getting you status symbol watches as presents, but that's besides the point. You told him not to get you a watch, and he got you one anyway. I'd give the same judgment if it was a hamster, a bag of cocaine, a boat, or a box of chocolates. You are in the right for asking him to return something that you told him you didn't want before he bought it.", "NTA normally, I\u2019d say accept the gift but you already have a watch you use, he gave you another one the year before you don\u2019t use, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to to say, it\u2019s not a gift you\u2019ll use and he either needs to be more responsive to your needs or just recognize he doesn\u2019t know what to get you.", "NTA he\u2019s stupid for getting you something you don\u2019t use. And it\u2019s expensive to own a Rolex.", "NTA \n\nHe knew you didn\u2019t want it, didn\u2019t consider your preferences at all. Sounds like he got a deal and liked the status symbol", "Listen, how else is your boyfriend supposed to get on the list for that Pepsi? Buying crap nobody else wants - like a two tone Lady Datejust - is part of the AD experience! Ciao.", "NTA\n\nIt's an expensive gift but you state you didn't want that kind of gift. You didn't say you didn't want a nice gift,  just not that gift. If he wants to splurge why not some Louis V or another designer bag?\n\nIt's a very expensive gift so while it may hurt him , I'd guess that you would rather have received an expensive gift that actually resonates with your lifestyle or aesthetic.\n\n\nIt's an unfortunate situation that is quite awkward but you are Def not an asshole.", "NTA \n\nCan you be sure it was real? If so, super dumb dumb.\n\nA Rolex is more than a watch - it\u2019s a solid financial investment. Your Apple Watch will be worth a can of baked beans in a year or so. You don\u2019t need to wear said Rolex. You can keep it in its box. Said Rolex will either hold its value, or more likely make you anywhere from 1k upwards over the space of a few years.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t feel you could accept it based on its value of course, understandable. I\u2019ll stfu now.", "I'm not sure what his thought process was, but he must've had some sort of motivation to do it, and was mislead. You're definitely NTA.

Wear it for special occasions.  That's how I wear mine. Other than that, I wear my Iwatch.  I bought my GMT Master in 1983 for $775.  They easily sell for over 13K now.  Keep it and keep it well.", "NAH, use it as jewellery, and wear it for special occasions, as it'd certainly make more of an impression than a generic Apple Watch, as a Rolex isn't a day to day watch.", "Wait, he didn't even have a Rolex himself!?

However, there\u2019s the possibility that your bf was disappointed in himself when you didn\u2019t like it, even if you told him so. So i would say clear things up a bit (and maybe speak in a kinder tone or smth idkk), as in explain why you don\u2019t like it and reassure that it doesn\u2019t change your love for him or smth, or maybe just cheer him up too.

According to sales data from Bob's Watches, the market average sale for a pre-owned Rolex has increased from less than $5,000 USD in 2011 to more than $13,000 USD in 2021. This surge is particularly notable in recent years due to the pandemic. Rolex has outperformed other major asset classes like real estate, stocks, and gold. Models like the Daytona have more than tripled in value over the last 10 years, with an average pre-owned price of over $30,000 USD. The Lady-Datejust model also took three spots in the top 15 best-selling Rolex watches list.\n\nThought-Provoking Questions\nInvestment Potential: Given the data, would you consider investing in a Rolex watch as an alternative to traditional assets?\nImpact of Pandemic: How do you think the pandemic has influenced the surge in Rolex prices?\nFemale Rolex Models: The Lady-Datejust took three spots in the top 15 list.
