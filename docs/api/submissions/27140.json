He should've listened.", "Nta\n\nUr boyfriend is an dolt. U told him straight up that you do not want a watch and he still got you one. The money could have been spent somewhere else", "NTA.  Gifts are supposed to be for the person receiving the gift.  He gave you the gift HE wanted you to have and ignored what you told him.    \nI would reconsider this relationship and sell the Rolex to buy something  you want.", "NTA-You boyfriend bought your birthday present more for him than you. He wanted people to know that he was rich enough to buy a Rolex for a birthday gift. Plus who buys watches for their GF on back-to-back birthdays?!", "NTA. Why watches two birthdays in a row? Is there a street vendor who sells knockoffs near his office or something?", "NTA you repeatedly told him you didn't want one before he bought it for you. He bought it for himself, not for you. It's not like he got you a $50 watch, that thing is probably $500-$5,000. Return that shit and buy a trip together.", "Umm yes YTA - Rolex are stupid expense and when ordered, they take 3-5 YEARS to make. I get that he's consistent in his gift giving but you could keep it and sell it for a profit later. Rolex sells at MARKET VALUE - not suggested retail. Depending on the model, you could net $10k. He gifted you an investment, not just a piece of wearable craftsmanship. \n\nClearly you should do your research before you act like a spoiled brat.", "NTA - Sell the watch.  Return the boyfriend, who's a hard-head who doesn't listen to you at all.", "NTA, If he didn't hint and get your opinion then YTA because you should be grateful for any gift. But he got your opinion and shouldn't be shocked when he didn't take your word that you wouldn't like the gift. I don't want over blow things out of proportions but if you two can't communicate that is a terrible state.", "INFO: were you nice when you told him this or did you sound rude and ungrateful?", "YTA.\n\nBe grateful and appreciative he thought about you well before your birthday.  I understand you didn\u2019t \u201cwant it\u201d but I\u2019d wager it meant something to him to be able to gift you that nice of a present.  You don\u2019t just run out to the store and grab one the morning of your birthday ffs.\n\nSmile, say thank you, put the rolie back in its pretty Green box with Certificate of Authenticity and hide it in a closet for the inevitable break up when you can then pawn it off and get whatever you want.", "NTA. That's way too pricey a gift to get for someone you know for a fact doesn't want it.", "I think the only way to teach him a lesson is to give that watch to a stranger. A stranger in need, one who sits by the window watching the water droplets collect and trail down, wishing life was just a little bit better. Who never asked for much from life, maybe a little extra  money for a lunch, a free book to read, a women\u2019s Rolex to give to his wife.", "Most likely a rep anyways. Don't worry about it lol", "NTA. He can't possibly be surprised that you don't want the thing, after you *repeatedly* told him you didn't want it.", "NTA as long as you weren't hurtful in how you told him you didn't like his gifts.", "NTA.\n\nThis is one of those things where you have to wonder if it is a fake, if it fell off the back of a truck, if he got a huge discount somewhere, or if he has a hookup for either real or fake ones. He\u2019s already gotten you a watch, you\u2019ve told him you don\u2019t want a watch, you have an Apple Watch. Why he insisted on this despite all evidence saying you wouldn\u2019t like is anyone\u2019s guess. However, my guess is that he had an easy way to get you this particular item and, because it\u2019s expensive and showy, cluelessly thought he could make it look like he put a lot of effort into a low-effort gift or that you\u2019d be wearing it and telling others he got it for you (implying he did a lot). He\u2019s probably sulking because he can\u2019t easily return the watch and/or when you go to pick out something together you\u2019ll probably realize there isn\u2019t much else that\u2019s the value of a Rolex that you can exchange this gift for. \n\nI think you should ask him why he got you something you clearly stated you didn\u2019t want in a gentle way. Ask him to help you understand his thought process and to share if there is anything significant about this watch (it\u2019s what his father have his mother for a birthday early on, it\u2019s a family heirloom, etc.). If he tells you he just felt like getting you a Rolex then you\u2019re going to want to decide if he\u2019s laughably bad with gifts or bad at listening or if something else is going on.", "NTA\n\nYou've made it very clear to him that you don't wear watches.\n\nIt seems like he's buying gifts more for himself than for you. He's not even taking your personal style, wrist size, jewelry type, etc. into account when getting the watches.", "Lol. The bf probably got a knock off and it will look odd finding an excuse not to go and exchange it at a Rolex dealership \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s a gift. You don\u2019t have to like it, but you should accept it graciously. You can absolutely return it, but telling him, \u2018I don\u2019t like it. You should return it to the jeweler\u2019 is rude. You should appreciate that he even got you a gift - and an expensive gift at that. Return it & find something you will wear.", "NTA. Also I am 99% positive a similar post but from the boyfriend\u2019s POV was made in the past few months; can confirm the general consensus that guy was TA", "Yep.", "The cheapest brand new ladies Rolex is over $6k. There are a few used ones in the $3k range but they will have flaws and won't be desirable models...  $5000 doesn't buy a new Rolex and only buys a few used ones.", "Nah she said multiple times she didn\u2019t want it. He clearly doesn\u2019t listen", "So they should be happy that their boyfriend ignored their explicitly stated wishes because they might be able to sell the gift later, for profit? That take is... certainly unique. Most people don't judge the quality of a gift by how much they could resell it for.", "And she didn\u2019t want any of that and repeatedly told him that. Is that so difficult to understand?", "If she's already told him she doesn't like or want watches before (which she said she had in the post when he hinted at it) then she is within her rights to not be nice or grateful to someone who has blatantly ignored her feelings and wishes.", "NTA agree with above but I\u2019d wait to have the larger conversation about gifting until after this has been returned & things have settled down. Frankly I\u2019d just make an Amazon list of gift ideas for the future & tell him not to go rogue.", "Yeah, like most of the \u201ccheap\u201d watches there are 10k and the popular models put you on a waiting list for years. The second hand versions of the popular models cost more than the original price.\n\nI know someone who\u2019s family members OWNS a Rolex store and he had to wait 12 months for his watch. Although these are the men\u2019s versions. I think the women\u2019s models are easier to buy.", "You obviously skipped the part where OP told him explicitly that she said not want another watch. OP was clear and respectful from the beginning and he did not care to listen. Consequences.", "A gift should be thoughtful and meaningful.  \nShe said she didn't want a watch AND doesn't wear the last one he got her.  \nHe didn't buy her a Rolex because he thought she wanted one, he bought her one she he could tell people \"I got my GF a Rolex\"  \nThis has the Homer wants a bowling ball, so buys one for Marge for her Birthday, written all over it.  \nOP NTA.", "Oooh can you find this or remember the title?", "shit, even worse.", "I didn\u2019t skip it. Again, it was a gift. He could have gotten her nothing.", "And ultimately, it\u2019s still a gift. How many people get gifts that are just kind of there? Gift Cards aren\u2019t (usually) thoughtful & meaningful, but someone has still given you a gift. They don\u2019t have to. That\u2019s the point I\u2019m making."]}
