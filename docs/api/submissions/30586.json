Chores haven't been an issues, until now. Tom is in pharmaceuticals and recently changed departments which means he now has more early shifts and nightshifts. When he gets home he is always pretty tired and goes to sleep or just relaxes. I told him that I noticed his share of the work piling up a lot more frequently and while I understand that he is exhausted, it is starting to bother me to which he responded he'll figure something out.\n\nYesterday, I came home and the flat was spotless! Laundry, dishes, everything! I was super happy and thanked him for cleaning up when he told me that his mum came for a visit and when he told her about his new shifts, she offered to clean up for him and also that she would come over more frequently. \n\nYou need to know that his mum does not like me very much because I'm white, come from a christian household (though we don't practice) and went to university. Yet, she would never say that to my face because she is really concerned about appearances. Also, she does not respect boundaries. Tom is aware of this which is why he is not pushing me to see her and cultivate a relationship outside of family gatherings and sporadic visits.\n\nI told Tom I appreciate her offer, but I would like him to turn it down because I don't feel comfortable having his mum over so frequently and beeing alone with her, and even less letting her be in our flat alone because of the boundary thing. I also told him that I felt a little violated that she did my laundry because my underwear and lingerie is in there. I also don't want to feel like we owe her anything if she is doing it for free.\n\nAt first he tried to find a compromise with me:\n\n1. I can watch his mum to make sure she respects our privacy, but that's really weird to just watch her clean and not help.\n2. She only comes when I'm not home, but again, privacy and boundries.\n3. She only does specific chores like the dishes, but chores can hardly be timed except for laundry, which I'm not okay with.\n4. I \"hide\" the things I don't want her to see and take out anything from the laundry I dont want her to touch, but that just seems like extra work for me. \n\nAt this point he calld me an AH because I'm not willing to compromise, but I feel like all of these \"compromises\" only benefit him, and I'm left with either more work or worries and definitely headaches. But I do feel a bit like an AH because she is offering to help for free and it would take a lot of stress off his shoulders, and at the end of the day, as long as it gets done it shouldn't matter who did it, but I can't help beeing uncomfortable. I wouldn't be if it was a stranger (cleaning service) but that is out of our budget. So would I be the AH if I keep refusing?", "created_utc": 1699440349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qj091/aita_for_not_letting_my_mother_in_law_clean_our/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is a clear violation of privacy for a couple to have his mom coming into the apartment frequently to clean it.  \n\nSadly, the problem isn't the mom.  The problem is the boyfriend.  You might need a new boyfriend.  The fact that he's not willing to set boundaries of behavior for his mom is a huge red flag.  If you stay with him, she's always going to be a huge PITA.  And it's not really her fault, she's just being her.  Because he allows it.", "His answer to a problem is to run to mommy and get her to do all his chores? Seriously?\n\nNTA. But I'd be worried by what this says about him more than the invonvenience of having her in your space.", "NTA.  This 'compromise' is just your bf being a lazy mama's boy.  You have to decide if you're willing to live with his 'problem solving\".", "NTA. He already knows you two don't get along and his genius idea is to have her come into your home repeatedly on a regular basis??? Is today opposite day or does your husband not care about you?", "So its your house (his and yours). He isn't able to do his chores and wants his mother to come by and do them for him. His mom doesn't like you and doesn't respect your boundaries but he is upset that you won't compromise in your own house? \n\nNTA. Tell your boyfriend he needs to find a way to do his own chores. His mom is welcome to visit him once in a while but not every now and then and No she shouldn't be allowed in the house unsupervised because she doesn't respect boundaries and supervising a guests movements is nothing but insulting so obviously you won't be doing that. Your boyfriend needs to show more respect towards you. This house belong to both of you and both need to be comfortable with what happens in the house.", "Nta why can\u2019t he pay for a cleaner that\u2019s independent to you both?\n\nHim doing his fair share of housework shouldn\u2019t be him calling mummy to come and do it for him. You\u2019d end up doing his chores to clean before she arrived to ensure she didn\u2019t do your laundry etc", "NTA. You have a right to privacy in your home and is your aren't happy with having MiL there then you have the right to enforce your boundary without feeling like an AH.\n\nThe more \"AH\" response is just order some items from LoveHoney and place them in drawers you don't want MiL to look . Hopefully then she'll change her mind about washing your lingerie.", "NTA. I find it troubling that your partner would be interested in asking his \"mommy\" to clean up after him. He's an adult. It's inappropriate for him to ask and for her to do it. Both of you work. If your schedules don't leave room for cleaning, hire someone to come in bi-weekly to do so. Otherwise, he needs to relax less, or you both need to relax your standards.", "NTA\n\nKeep refusing, this is stepping over your boundaries with his mother.\n\nTell him no and to get his share of the chores done himself.\n\nDo not give in", "Oh hell no! NTA\n\nHe did this behind your back, knowing you would never agree to his mother having free reign to your home, in order to set a precedent from which you have to argue a no-win situation to come back from. The disrespect is unbelievable.\n\nAdd to that he has told you through his actions that he has no intention of being a functional adult. What happens to his chores when his mommy dies? After that much lifetime of \u201cservice\u201d he\u2019s not going to reel in his old-age earned attitude and start doing his chores.\n\nTake a hard look at what your life is going to be and decide with your eyes open.", "NTA. Your bf is getting his mum to do his part of the chores in your home. That is not fair. He must do his own work. Everybody is tired at the end of a working day, but they still have to do the dishes and their laundry and whatever else is needed in the home. His mum is bound to go snooping, if she is in your flat on her own so often. Don't allow it. Your bf should pull up his big boy pants and start carrying his own weight in this world. Once you have moved in with a partner, mummy's free maidservice should come to an end.", "NTA, but I fail to understand why are you putting up with a family of racists? Don't you see anything wrong with the blatant racism the woman is exhibiting? **\"In our homecountry you would be considered sick with that complexion, hahaha\"** like seriously? I'd tell her to fuck right off. Him too, for that matter.", "Mama\u2019s boy red flags are flying here, OP! His mother already made herself comfortable there. You\u2019re going to have to address this very quickly!\n\nNTA", "Definitely NTA but I think you may be If you stay with bf. What else will he try and outsource to his mum. Childcare etc. one day? I think all his options are  unacceptable. Will he get his Dad in to do any maintenance,  mow the lawn etc. He sounds like he wants a slave, not a partner.", "Red flag if he is calling you AH. If boyfriends mother doesn\u2019t like you I guarantee she will look through your belongings.", "NTA. I understand the exhaustion but making it harder for you, using the mom service, is just a lil bit irresponsible, if not childish. Xpecially if it's ruining your privacy.", "INFO how do you know she doesn't like you, and for those reasons, if you're also saying she's never said those things to you?", "I don\u2019t get why everyone is calling him a mommas boy. He didn\u2019t go running to her, she came over, they talked and she offered to help. \n\nHe told you he\u2019s trying to figure something out because you\u2019re upset he no longer has the time or energy which you admitted to to do the chores. \n\nYou agree you can\u2019t afford a cleaning service. I get you don\u2019t like his mom but either you understand his chores are going to pile up because of his schedule or you accept outside help by either figuring something out with his mom or finding room in the budget to hire someone. \n\nI don\u2019t want to say Y T A but you\u2019re not actually N T A either. He isn\u2019t T A at all in my opinion", "I think you have more of a husband problem than a MIL one. Him running to his mum to do his chores is so not the solution here. As for the MIL, lock away anything you particularly don't want her snooping through and then browse ebay for cheap sex toys that you can leave on show around the flat. That might possibly embarrass her into stopping voluntarily", ">At first he tried to find a compromise with me:\n\nWhy are none of the options for *him* to do any cleaning and laundry?\n\nAnd how dare he treat his mother like an unpaid cleaner?\n\nYou are NTA but you need to rethink this whole relationship.  This guy has some issues.", "YTA Which is a bit harsh in this situation, but that\u2019s my only choice. Seriously, take advantage of this amazing opportunity. It\u2019s a win-win. Wash your own panties, if you don\u2019t want her to see those. I love when my mil comes to visit and takes over laundry duties. She\u2019s like a ninja with clothes. That feeling you had of how clean everything was, you loved it, right? Why would you want that to stop? It was free to boot!!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And the laundry thing. Hell no is anyone apart from the ones living in the house ever gonna touch my laundry. I would have lost it just on that. And you don\u2019t need mommy coming and doing it for you dude. Suck it up buttercup!! You\u2019re an adult and that\u2019s part of life. And you need to have respect for your girlfriend and absolutely not have her there when neither of you is home cuz that\u2019s a big violation not to mention a red flag and if she doesn\u2019t want to be there alone with her then boyfriend you need to make sure these boundaries are set first. But you shouldn\u2019t be having her coming to do any of it to begin with. I\u2019ve been in her position with in-laws and you shouldn\u2019t put her there. Tell mommy thanks but no thanks!!", "Also mamas boys always say they will do something when it comes to saying something but they are usually too scared and just say they did. For real. Been there. If he tells you she won\u2019t come and clean anymore get a cameo cuz I\u2019m telling you they will never go against their mom and hurt their feelings!!", "Nta", "yeah i would break up. just because you have early or nightshifts does not mean you can put you feet on the table and slack of. NTA", "NOPE. Very uncomfortable", "Or, your bf can do his share of the work like he should be and leave MIL at home. Simple solution. Tell bf to grow up and figure out how to manage his responsibilities, or you will never shake her because having her around is obviously very convenient for him. NTA at all. But this sounds more like a bf problem than a MIL problem because he's the one encouraging it.", "NTA - If he can\u2019t help with cleaning then he can pay to have someone other than his mother to do it.", "NTA.", "I'm sure he is quite happy with mommy continuing to clean up after him. He's 24 not 14. Time for him to lose the underoos and grow up and grow a pair.", "NTA.\n\nMIL cleaned our house once. I still feel the judgement and she spent the next six months telling me how I was \"doing everything wrong\" until I finally snapped. I hate that I snapped but changing the subject ad nauseam does not work with that woman. And my MIL doesn't come with a side of blatant racism. I can't even imagine dealing with that.", "NTA. He admits his mother has boundary issues and doesn't like you, but wants you to be OK with her having full access to your private living space?", "NTA - your boyfriend is a mama\u2019s boy and does not respect your boundaries, not good. Being devils advocate I wonder if there\u2019s a way you could use this situation to your benefit and get free labor so she does your chores too? Hmmm. Use her maybe, she does everything excluding the bedroom and laundry, make that racist wash your toilet, lol.", "NTA, your boyfriend believes women are only to be mothers, maids and sex slaves. Do with that info what you will but I'd be out cause he doesn't respect you!!", "NTA but for crying out loud, this relationship is doomed.  He's from a culture where it is expected for men to be mommy's boys forever and for women be \"dutiful\".  You will always be seen as a problem by his family (and unconsciously by him).  You're still young, find a man that truly respects your intelligence and independence and doesn't need mommy to clean up after him.", "NTA.  Tom is lazy and needs to pull his weight, irrespective of how tired he feels.   A grown man shouldn't be allowing his mother to do his chores for him.", "NTA.\n\nI'd get a new bf, I'm not staying someone who would rather have their mom clean their apartment instead of themselves", "NTA. Hire a maid as a compromise if you can afford one", "NTA.  It's nice that his mom is willing to help, but you have legit concerns if he's ok with her doing his chores, and seeing your underwear and lingerie.  That's a lot of eww right there.  BF needs to find a different compromise.  It might have to involve changing chores or timing.", "NTA sounds like it\u2019s time to move out", "Where did he run to mommy? She offered when she came over and saw the mess", "She said these things to him when the relationship was still fresh and urged him to not enter a relationship with me and she regularly makes underhanded comments torwards me. Examples:\n\n\"In our homecountry you would be considered sick with that complexion, hahaha. I guess we can only hope your kids will take after their dad or he will have to carry a birthcertificate to prove they are his.\"\n\n\"Westerner girls have no sense of duty to their family, otherwise they would go work instead of go to university. Oh OP, I didn't see you there!\"\n\n \"I don't mind that your family is christian as long as you don't take my grandbabies to church.\"\n\n\"I don't get the whole 50/50 thing. In our culture it is a wives duty to do these things. Oh but don't worry, I'm sure getting you degree was just as important as building a homely environment.\"\n\nJust to name a few.

NAH for not wanting her in your home.", "I agree these aren't \"compromises\" from OP, but it seemed odd to claim that her BF went running to mom. Why do so many people assume the worst of intentions in these posts?", "Because he never planned on doing chores in the first place (because mommy established that he doesn't have to), he was waiting out OP, to see if he just ignored his chores that OP would suck it up and clean everything for him", "So..speculation? I ask again:\n\n> Why do so many people assume the worst of intentions in these posts?"]}
