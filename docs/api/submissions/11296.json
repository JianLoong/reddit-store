We a invited a bunch of good friends to our wedding - it will be bigger.\n\nOne of my friends (John Doe)  and his wife (Jane Doe) are furious with me because I invited another good friend from college (Brady )  went through a very conservative phase. Brady had made some stupid FB posts and really bit hard on the far right train a few years ago, so he had a falling out with John and Jane and some of my other friends.  Brady has since admitted that the FB posts and conservative phase were over the top and has confided in me that he was recently diagnosed with BD and the posts were associated with manic episodes and that he has gone to therapy and worked really hard to change since his BD almost ruined his life.\n\nI am not as close with Jane Doe i only see her once a year at most, but I have been good friends with John since 2014 and my wife and I were some of his only friends at their wedding.\n\nAt the start of last year, John messaged me saying Jane did not feel safe around Brady and asked me if he was invited to the wedding - I was unsure about inviting Brady at the time so I told him the truth and said i was unsure but that i was leaning towards not inviting Brady to avoid conflict. I asked if there was anything beyond Brady's conservative posts (like let\u2019s go brandon, nancy pelosi sucks, back the blue, the election was stolen) that made Jane feel unsafe and he said he was unsure. Also asked my other friends if they knew of anything (violent incidents, personal messages, etc) beyond the FB posts and they did not know as well.\n\nFast forward a few months, there have been a few deaths in my family and it has been a tragic year but Brady was there for me through the entire time and was a great friend - so I decided to include him on the invite list.\n\nWe sent out our RSVPs in early Jan and we got word from Brady in Late Jan saying that he had moved around his work schedule to be able to make it to the Wedding in March. I told him that he was on thin ice and needed to be on his best behavior and not bring up any politics and he assured me that he would follow my rules. \n\nIn order to get ahead of any issues, I IMMEDIATELY told all of my friends who might have had an issue that Brady will be there and they said \"it is your wedding and we can tolerate him for a weekend no big deal\" except for John and Jane I personally messaged John about it and offered to comp any fees that they had paid in regards to the wedding so far if they did not want to come based on this news and John said he was \"furious\" and that \"he should have been told earlier\" and that Jane is now refusing to come to the wedding.  Jane also unfriended and blocked me on social media.\n\nI still have no idea what the issue was beyond some stupid FB posts but I am really really pissed that Jane is basically saying \"you are dead to me\" because I did not let her pick my wedding list.\n\nEdit: changed the acronyms since they were confusing\n\nAITA for not telling Jane and John that I invited Brady sooner?", "created_utc": 1677762602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g2eb8/aita_for_inviting_my_controversial_friend_to_my/", "score": 450, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have everything from \"taxes should be lower\" to \"these entire groups of people shouldn't exist in the US\" to full on QAnon reality denial.\n\nIf people are telling you they don't feel safe around someone, I'm suspecting these FB posts were pretty out there. What's the actual issue?", "Can\u2019t make a judgment without knowing what the posts were. That can make a difference", "INFO: \n\nBe very descriptive. What were the facebook posts? what made your friend feel so unsafe ?", "INFO:\n\n'I still have no idea what the issue was beyond some stupid FB posts but I am really really pissed that FFW is basically saying \"you are dead to me\" because I did not let her pick my wedding list.'\n\nI think there's clearly more to these fb posts that you're letting on; they resulted in F1 feeling 'unsafe', according to you. Clearly a lot of your other friends have an issue if they're talking about 'tolerating' him.", "Help, out of the loop. When people now say they feel unsafe, are they talking actual physical violence or someone that may disagree with them or insult, make them uneasy?

Obviously his medical issues, now being treated, are private.  But does Brady not want to do any kind of retraction on facebook?  Or show support for things he denigrated?  Does he feel no need to make amends or clarify that he doesn't actually hold those views?", "EDIT: I misread the OP as saying this friend had BPD (Borderline) instead of BD (Bipolar).\n\nI stand by my judgement of NAH. If he was posting extreme conservative views people have a right to feel unsafe around him. You're free to invite him to the wedding, but that is on you. Other people have no reason to forgive him for saying potentially harmful/hateful things just because he wasn't in his right head. Unfortunately having a mental illness means accepting the consequences of your actions- even when you weren't in control you can't expect people to forgive you or accept you back into their lives. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOriginal comment: \n\nI'm just going to urge you to be careful. If he has BPD chances are he is going to disrespect boundaries regardless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, as others have said, \"conservative FB posts\" could be anywhere from saying \"I don't like Biden\" to \"LGBT people are evil \" or denial of the pandemic that killed millions. . If it's anything like the latter two then I could understand people saying they feel unsafe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am just saying, based off my own experience with BPD and conservatism in this day and age I don't blame Jane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNAH.", "YTA for mixing FB (Facebook) F1 (Formula 1)  FF (Flip flop) FFW (I have no idea)\n\nand expecting us to have a clue what all your acronym's mean.", "NAH, judged narrowly as it relates to the wedding.  OP can invite whomever they want to their wedding and guests can choose to attend or not.\n\nThat said, if OP wants to associate with far right extremists who post incendiary things online that directly relate to and attack their other friends lives, then you can't be shocked there are consequences of siding with hate.  OP is very much an AH in this regard.", "YTA for the unreadable abbreviations. Just give people some fake names, ffs.", "NTA - it is your wedding and if someone was a good friend to you during a rough time you have the right to invite them to YOUR wedding. you did not even ask your friends to forgive or talk to this friend all you did was say that he would be in the same place as them - it\u2019s your wedding and as long as your future wife is comfortable with your guests that are coming to the wedding - that is all that matters.", "Because they didn't actually clarify what 'uncomfortable' meant for the wife, and it's your own wedding, I'm going with NTA.\n\nThis is another guest at a large wedding, whom they don't even need to interact with. If this had been someone who, for example, abused this woman, or had caused personal harm, I may vote differently, but as it stands you're inviting *your friends* to celebrate *your wedding*, and their issues are their own.\n\nThey wouldn't be AHs for just not attending; an invitation is not a summons. But they've definitely reacted otherwise like AHs.", "INFO - you\u2019re avoiding saying exactly what was in these posts, in every single comment you\u2019ve made some examples, but context to a situation would be very important. Please stop withholding what was in those posts.", "INFO: has Brady done anything to actually make Jane feel unsafe? Has he caused harm to anyone? Or is she mistaking \u201cunsafe\u201d for \u201cuncomfortable?\u201d", "NTA, you can invite who you want, but there is clearly a back story here.", "INFO\n\nWe're gonna need some details on these posts. This type of reaction is pretty extreme for some simple \"Let's go Brandon\" dumbassery. If that's all it is, your friends are all idiots. If he went far enough right that he's calling gay people groomers, or saying racist shit, then YTA for keeping in contact with this person.", "You can invite whoever you want.  You did give pretty short notice though\u2014you\u2019d already told the others you weren\u2019t inviting that friend, the wedding is right around the corner.  It\u2019s good that you reached out so you didn\u2019t end up with this one friend causing a scene at the reception.  \n\nIt seems your friend has made this a hill to die on as far as y\u2019all\u2019s friendship is concerned.  I think they\u2019ve made it pretty clear y\u2019all aren\u2019t friends anymore.  It will be interesting to see if they cut if others of y\u2019all\u2019s friend group who are willing to tolerate maga friend.", "NTA. A wedding is not a political convention. As long as the friend keeps controversial opinions to himself and does not attack/bully anyone, you can invite him. For any event, if people do not want to attend if someone else is present, it's their right to decline the invitation, but not to tell the host whom to put on the guest list.", "YTA because I'm gonna assume if your friends don't feel safe that \"conservative leaning\" is actually code for being racist, transphobic, or homophobic and you still chose to invite them knowing at least 2 of your other friends don't feel safe around this person. Especially after telling them you were originally leaning toward NOT inviting them. \n\nYou can invite whoever you want to your wedding, but the message you are sending to your friends is clear so don't be surprised by the consequences.\n\nEdit: I've read your updates and am not changing my verdict. You knew Jane and John did not want to attend if he was invited. Instead of telling them you changed your mind you sent the invites and waited for Brady's RSVP, giving zero consideration to Jane and John who simply asked to be told if he was invited (not to be told he was going AFTER invites were sent)  Honestly it doesn't even matter why. They made it clear their attendance was hinging on his invitation. Ofc they are upset since you never talked to them about changing your mind.  I don't block folks so idk why Jane did that, but honestly you were told she felt unsafe and because YOU don't feel unsafe around him you showed you didn't care. So I don't blame her for also wanting to distance herself from you. John is mad cause he's stuck in the middle. At this point you've ruined your friendships with Jane and John so I hope Brady is worth it.\n\nI'm also concerned that you don't understand why the posts he mentions were and still are deeply concerning to a great many people.", "There\u2019s a lot to unpack here. Sticking to the question at hand - NAH. Honestly you went out of your way to let them know problem friend would be there. \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding. You can invite who you want. Yes that means you get to invite your \u201cconservative\u201d Facebook posting friend if that is important to you. But remember that your friends and guests can also be uncomfortable and upset by it. You cannot control their feelings or emotions. You cannot control who they feel comfortable being around and who they do not. \n\nThat said, if Jane is having this extreme of a reaction there has to be more to this.", "NTA, you can invite whoever you want to your wedding. Our friendship would be over if you put me in that situation, and I wouldn\u2019t explode on you about it nor look back with regrets.", "I think everyone in this entire thread is purposely ignoring a major factor. He got better. He was mentally ill, got help and is taking responsibility for his actions. \n\nIf we collectively hold no space for crazy conservatives to get better and improve themselves, if they are genuine, then what's left to strive for. If OP is correct that his friend got better and genuinely wants to be better and is working on it, wtf is the problem still? \n\nRedemption is the only path for these people. Seriously. There has to be a path for redemption or they will just stay crazy and bitter and a bigot forever. \n\nSo unless OP is misconstruing the extent to which his friend has improved. There is nothing left for the random Facebook people to be \"unsafe\" about. He didn't personally assault or threaten them, OP claims he wasn't directly even a bigot, he wants to change. You can't shun him for the rest of his life if he is doing the things to be a better person. Especially when this isn't about Jane right now. \n\nSo I guess the real judgement comes down to whether OP is being honest about his friend actually improving. If so, NTA. If your friend is no longer conservatively crazy (not referring to the BPD) then you need to share that information with your other friends.\n\nIf you know in your heart that he still believes these things then you are definitely TA. You can't lie to everyone, online and in person and frankly to yourself, that he has changed if he just, hasn't. Those bad conservatives are, well bad. It's not about a normal political disagreement. I had a coworker who literally told me I should be shot in the streets for being queer. It's not normal and there is no place for these people in a society.", "Nta\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, you don\u2019t need to preclear guests with your friends. You reached out and have a heads up is more than what you had to do. Your friends wife has made her choice. Nothing you can do about that", "Esh she doesn\u2019t get to choose your list but you\u2019re inviting someone who might openly hate people based on groups they were born a member of. That makes you an ah to anyone you inflict him on friend to you or not. If he was just wildly passionate about weird stuff no one would care.", "NTA. He was a good friend to you when you needed it most, that counts for something and it's nice that you're inviting him to your wedding.\n\nUnless there is more going on than a disagreement over politics, FF and FFW should be able to suck it up and support you and your partner on your big day. If there's more to it than a disagreement, you should find out what it is before making a decision.\n\nBesides that, unless the wedding is a very small affair, they will probably not be forced to interact with each other anyway.\n\nMy partner and I were at a wedding a few months ago. I'm neutral about this person but my partner dislikes them quite a bit. We didn't interact with them and everything was fine.", "NTA it's your wedding, invite whomever you want.", "As it comes to the wedding itself, NAH- you can invite who you want, and anyone who has a problem with that doesn't have to go and doesn't have to be friend with you if your association with someone causes them a problem. OP you keep saying you don't want to go into specifics and that's your choice, but seeing as you're close friends with \"John\" and he's absolutely furious about it, it kinda sounds like there's more than just \"stupid facebook posts\". Something you just brush off as a phase might be a huge warning sign to other people.  \n\n\nEDIT: Have you actually talked to John or Jane in depth to find out what the big deal is?", "So are you gonna tell us what he said besides he going to vote for trump? Sounds like you\u2019re trying to downplay the situation to justify you inviting him. You\u2019re NTA for inviting him because it\u2019s your wedding but YTA for being upset she doesn\u2019t want to deal with you anymore. I want to add that the people you keep around are a reflection of your character and since you decided to side with Mr.Controversial she no longer wants to associate with you and you have no right to be mad.", "Just my two cents but you seem pretty cavilar about FFW not liking F1. There may be a reason and she may not feel confortable sharing it with you. I personally hate to be around my sis\u2019s husband and I REFUSE to let him and sis take the kids and especially for him to be alone with my kids. Do I need to give reasons or can you trust that I\u2019m justified? \n\nYour wedding, your guest list, so technically NTA, but the fact that you assume it\u2019s \u201cjust some Facebook posts\u201d and nothing more shows your lack of imagination and concern. FFW doesn\u2019t want to be around F1 and YTA for not caring or respecting that.", "NTA. I have friends with differing views that outside of that are incredible friends to me. I tried to police my friend group based on what people were posting for a few years, and it made me miserable. \n\nYou gave FF and FFW the heads up F1 would be there. YWBTA if they just showed up and were ambushed with F1, but you let them know. They have the right to react and do what they want. You have the right to invite who you want.", "NTA\n\nFFW is somehow making your wedding about her. \n\nShe was invited and made the choice not to go due to the other guests, whatever, that's her prerogative. Her getting FF to jump on you? Blocking you on socials? Over your guest list? Yuck. That's toxic. F1 was there for you in your time of need and helped you get through those difficult times. I can see why you would want your friend there to help you celebrate. \n\nCould you have had a conversation with FF about your intentions of inviting F1 earlier? Sure, but you were also dealing with your grief. You got right on the horn as soon as the official invitations went out last month and I think that is plenty of time.  Congratulations on the upcoming wedding and best of luck!", "It's your wedding and you invite who you want. NTA", "NTA, but FF and FFW absolutely are. \n\nThey are discriminating against someone for having political beliefs different than their beliefs. That \"I don't feel safe\" business is complete BS, since F1 hasn't done anything to indicate he would harm anyone. Conservative does not equal dangerous, any more than liberal equals dangerous. (of course, your friends are probably not liberal since the first line of the liberal definition is \"*willing to respect or accept behavior or opinions different from one's own; open to new ideas.*\")\n\nMaybe F1 will feel \"unsafe\" around people like FF and FFW who are so neurotic and irrational?  \n\n\nInvite whoever you want.

Set the boundaries say its your wedding and you want both there but don\u2019t be shocked by the outcome.", "Info:  What exactly did he post? The political spectrum is awfully wide and conservative Facebook post can mean anything from wanting smaller government to Qanon to hugely bigoted racist nonsense.

Is he going to attack her at the wedding?", "I understand \"people making me feel unsafe\", but this is a wedding. In public. The realistic bar for someone to make you feel unsafe in an event with a large number of other people is pretty high.\n\nF1, from your posts, is a Trump supporter, and I suspect that your \"pro-police\" comment actually means the sort of person who thinks that all the predominantly black people killed by police are criminals and shouldn't have been evading arrest, and they'd have been fine if they had just complied with orders.\n\nIn other words, F1 is a very stupid racist. It is not possible to engage with the data and  also believe that there isn't a widespread problem in our police agencies.\n\nBut being a stupid racist and a Trump supporter doesn't actually make anyone personally unsafe. Sure - voting for Trump, and so supporting his racist, misogynistic, homophobic policies and appointees contributes to making a large number of people less safe, but that's because of the evil nonsense he's supporting, and not because of his personal presence.\n\nAbout half the people that voted, voted for Trump.

If he's saying those things while manic then he believes them the whole time, he's just too scared to say them.\n\nI will say that bipolar that manifests with paranoia can make you more vulnerable to crazy conspiracy theories, but as a general rule if your entire friend group (ie - the people you trust) are saying the opposite thing to you then you don't go down the rabbit hole unless you're running on confirmation bias because you believed it already.

If you want to restrict my right to make my own medical decisions, then why would I want to spend time with someone who has more respect for a corpse than me? If you want to see that Group X are not monsters, you do the work, you don't expect them to risk themselves to *maybe* enlighten you.\n\nY'know that saying about someone sitting at a table with 10 Nazis?

I live in a purple state so I held my nose and voted against trump.\n\nBut that's the reality. If they are still willing to vote republican, they are voting for women of childbearing age to not have bodily autonomy, for white supremacy, for trans children to be taken away from their parents who are willing to treat them, for young women to show their genitals if they want to participate in sports, for children to go hungry because their parents should work harder.\n\nThere is no separating a fiscal conservative republican from the atrocities the republican party aims for any longer.  \"I'm not a maga conservative\".

I also love how Brady has changed and doesn't post those things publicly anymore but it also hasn't been made clear if he has vocally and publicly rescinded those posts presently either. Maybe he actually just stopped posting because of the blow back. Like you can stop posting hateful things, but I'm going to remember that you did. If you don't start sharing things proving to me you don't subscribe to those beliefs anymore then why should I just assume you've changed your mind and don't think them anymore.\n\nOP only mentioned Brady telling OP these things, not that it's widely known or that Brady has attempted reparations. But OP also doesn't see what's so bad about those posts either, so I'm not surprised.\n\nI do feel for Brady, if he is going through a rough time and has realized and is working on his issues.

When he\u2019s manic, he does some crazy shit. He tries really hard. Takes his meds. Sees a therapist. But as he ages, sometimes the meds need adjusting. And that\u2019s when he goes off on fantasy tangents. His family helps, meds are adjusted, he sees his therapist more frequently, and gets back to the real world.

I don't think any of that has any bearing on this since this is more about whether OP should have given John and Jane a heads up or not.

We simply don't know enough beyond the fact Brady made a lot of racially charged (at the very least) posts and I don't think it's a far stretch to wonder if someone posting something like that in a manic state, might still believe it deep down after coming out of that state.
