We a invited a bunch of good friends to our wedding - it will be bigger.\n\nOne of my friends (John Doe)  and his wife (Jane Doe) are furious with me because I invited another good friend from college (Brady )  went through a very conservative phase. Brady had made some stupid FB posts and really bit hard on the far right train a few years ago, so he had a falling out with John and Jane and some of my other friends.  Brady has since admitted that the FB posts and conservative phase were over the top and has confided in me that he was recently diagnosed with BD and the posts were associated with manic episodes and that he has gone to therapy and worked really hard to change since his BD almost ruined his life.\n\nI am not as close with Jane Doe i only see her once a year at most, but I have been good friends with John since 2014 and my wife and I were some of his only friends at their wedding.\n\nAt the start of last year, John messaged me saying Jane did not feel safe around Brady and asked me if he was invited to the wedding - I was unsure about inviting Brady at the time so I told him the truth and said i was unsure but that i was leaning towards not inviting Brady to avoid conflict. I asked if there was anything beyond Brady's conservative posts (like let\u2019s go brandon, nancy pelosi sucks, back the blue, the election was stolen) that made Jane feel unsafe and he said he was unsure. Also asked my other friends if they knew of anything (violent incidents, personal messages, etc) beyond the FB posts and they did not know as well.\n\nFast forward a few months, there have been a few deaths in my family and it has been a tragic year but Brady was there for me through the entire time and was a great friend - so I decided to include him on the invite list.\n\nWe sent out our RSVPs in early Jan and we got word from Brady in Late Jan saying that he had moved around his work schedule to be able to make it to the Wedding in March. I told him that he was on thin ice and needed to be on his best behavior and not bring up any politics and he assured me that he would follow my rules. \n\nIn order to get ahead of any issues, I IMMEDIATELY told all of my friends who might have had an issue that Brady will be there and they said \"it is your wedding and we can tolerate him for a weekend no big deal\" except for John and Jane I personally messaged John about it and offered to comp any fees that they had paid in regards to the wedding so far if they did not want to come based on this news and John said he was \"furious\" and that \"he should have been told earlier\" and that Jane is now refusing to come to the wedding.  Jane also unfriended and blocked me on social media.\n\nI still have no idea what the issue was beyond some stupid FB posts but I am really really pissed that Jane is basically saying \"you are dead to me\" because I did not let her pick my wedding list.\n\nEdit: changed the acronyms since they were confusing\n\nAITA for not telling Jane and John that I invited Brady sooner?", "created_utc": 1677762602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g2eb8/aita_for_inviting_my_controversial_friend_to_my/", "score": 3061, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Clearly a lot of your other friends have an issue if they're talking about 'tolerating' him.", "Help, out of the loop. When people now say they feel unsafe, are they talking actual physical violence or someone that may disagree with them or insult, make them uneasy?

Does he feel no need to make amends or clarify that he doesn't actually hold those views?", "EDIT: I misread the OP as saying this friend had BPD (Borderline) instead of BD (Bipolar).\n\nI stand by my judgement of NAH. If he was posting extreme conservative views people have a right to feel unsafe around him. You're free to invite him to the wedding, but that is on you. Other people have no reason to forgive him for saying potentially harmful/hateful things just because he wasn't in his right head. Unfortunately having a mental illness means accepting the consequences of your actions- even when you weren't in control you can't expect people to forgive you or accept you back into their lives. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOriginal comment: \n\nI'm just going to urge you to be careful. If he has BPD chances are he is going to disrespect boundaries regardless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, as others have said, \"conservative FB posts\" could be anywhere from saying \"I don't like Biden\" to \"LGBT people are evil \" or denial of the pandemic that killed millions. . If it's anything like the latter two then I could understand people saying they feel unsafe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am just saying, based off my own experience with BPD and conservatism in this day and age I don't blame Jane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNAH.", "YTA for mixing FB (Facebook) F1 (Formula 1)  FF (Flip flop) FFW (I have no idea)\n\nand expecting us to have a clue what all your acronym's mean.", "NAH, judged narrowly as it relates to the wedding.  OP can invite whomever they want to their wedding and guests can choose to attend or not.\n\nThat said, if OP wants to associate with far right extremists who post incendiary things online that directly relate to and attack their other friends lives, then you can't be shocked there are consequences of siding with hate.  OP is very much an AH in this regard.\n\nEDIT: After my comment, the post was edited for clarity and certain details about the comments and Brady's mental state became more clearly stated.  While I truly support Brady in his growth and hope he continues to get the support he deserves as a human being, I totally understand why the Does aren't comfortable around him.  I stand by there being no AH here, and cautiously extend that to Brady as well given the revelations.  The original lack of details and cagey replies about whether his online presence manifested in real life did no one any favors.", "YTA for the unreadable abbreviations. Just give people some fake names, ffs.", "NTA - it is your wedding and if someone was a good friend to you during a rough time you have the right to invite them to YOUR wedding. you did not even ask your friends to forgive or talk to this friend all you did was say that he would be in the same place as them - it\u2019s your wedding and as long as your future wife is comfortable with your guests that are coming to the wedding - that is all that matters.", "Because they didn't actually clarify what 'uncomfortable' meant for the wife, and it's your own wedding, I'm going with NTA.\n\nThis is another guest at a large wedding, whom they don't even need to interact with. If this had been someone who, for example, abused this woman, or had caused personal harm, I may vote differently, but as it stands you're inviting *your friends* to celebrate *your wedding*, and their issues are their own.\n\nThey wouldn't be AHs for just not attending; an invitation is not a summons. But they've definitely reacted otherwise like AHs.", "INFO - you\u2019re avoiding saying exactly what was in these posts, in every single comment you\u2019ve made some examples, but context to a situation would be very important. Please stop withholding what was in those posts.", "INFO: has Brady done anything to actually make Jane feel unsafe? Has he caused harm to anyone? Or is she mistaking \u201cunsafe\u201d for \u201cuncomfortable?\u201d", "NTA, you can invite who you want, but there is clearly a back story here.", "INFO\n\nWe're gonna need some details on these posts. This type of reaction is pretty extreme for some simple \"Let's go Brandon\" dumbassery. If that's all it is, your friends are all idiots. If he went far enough right that he's calling gay people groomers, or saying racist shit, then YTA for keeping in contact with this person.", "You can invite whoever you want.  You did give pretty short notice though\u2014you\u2019d already told the others you weren\u2019t inviting that friend, the wedding is right around the corner.  It\u2019s good that you reached out so you didn\u2019t end up with this one friend causing a scene at the reception.  \n\nIt seems your friend has made this a hill to die on as far as y\u2019all\u2019s friendship is concerned.  I think they\u2019ve made it pretty clear y\u2019all aren\u2019t friends anymore.  It will be interesting to see if they cut if others of y\u2019all\u2019s friend group who are willing to tolerate maga friend.", "NTA. A wedding is not a political convention. As long as the friend keeps controversial opinions to himself and does not attack/bully anyone, you can invite him. For any event, if people do not want to attend if someone else is present, it's their right to decline the invitation, but not to tell the host whom to put on the guest list.", "YTA because I'm gonna assume if your friends don't feel safe that \"conservative leaning\" is actually code for being racist, transphobic, or homophobic and you still chose to invite them knowing at least 2 of your other friends don't feel safe around this person. Especially after telling them you were originally leaning toward NOT inviting them. \n\nYou can invite whoever you want to your wedding, but the message you are sending to your friends is clear so don't be surprised by the consequences.\n\nEdit: I've read your updates and am not changing my verdict. You knew Jane and John did not want to attend if he was invited. Instead of telling them you changed your mind you sent the invites and waited for Brady's RSVP, giving zero consideration to Jane and John who simply asked to be told if he was invited (not to be told he was going AFTER invites were sent)  Honestly it doesn't even matter why. They made it clear their attendance was hinging on his invitation. Ofc they are upset since you never talked to them about changing your mind.  I don't block folks so idk why Jane did that, but honestly you were told she felt unsafe and because YOU don't feel unsafe around him you showed you didn't care. So I don't blame her for also wanting to distance herself from you. John is mad cause he's stuck in the middle. At this point you've ruined your friendships with Jane and John so I hope Brady is worth it.\n\nI'm also concerned that you don't understand why the posts he mentions were and still are deeply concerning to a great many people.", "There\u2019s a lot to unpack here. Sticking to the question at hand - NAH. Honestly you went out of your way to let them know problem friend would be there. \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding. You can invite who you want. Yes that means you get to invite your \u201cconservative\u201d Facebook posting friend if that is important to you. But remember that your friends and guests can also be uncomfortable and upset by it. You cannot control their feelings or emotions. You cannot control who they feel comfortable being around and who they do not. \n\nThat said, if Jane is having this extreme of a reaction there has to be more to this.", "NTA, you can invite whoever you want to your wedding. Our friendship would be over if you put me in that situation, and I wouldn\u2019t explode on you about it nor look back with regrets.", "I think everyone in this entire thread is purposely ignoring a major factor. He got better. He was mentally ill, got help and is taking responsibility for his actions. \n\nIf we collectively hold no space for crazy conservatives to get better and improve themselves, if they are genuine, then what's left to strive for. If OP is correct that his friend got better and genuinely wants to be better and is working on it, wtf is the problem still? \n\nRedemption is the only path for these people. Seriously. There has to be a path for redemption or they will just stay crazy and bitter and a bigot forever. \n\nSo unless OP is misconstruing the extent to which his friend has improved. There is nothing left for the random Facebook people to be \"unsafe\" about. He didn't personally assault or threaten them, OP claims he wasn't directly even a bigot, he wants to change. You can't shun him for the rest of his life if he is doing the things to be a better person. Especially when this isn't about Jane right now. \n\nSo I guess the real judgement comes down to whether OP is being honest about his friend actually improving. If so, NTA. If your friend is no longer conservatively crazy (not referring to the BPD) then you need to share that information with your other friends.\n\nIf you know in your heart that he still believes these things then you are definitely TA. You can't lie to everyone, online and in person and frankly to yourself, that he has changed if he just, hasn't. Those bad conservatives are, well bad. It's not about a normal political disagreement. I had a coworker who literally told me I should be shot in the streets for being queer. It's not normal and there is no place for these people in a society.", "Nta\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, you don\u2019t need to preclear guests with your friends. You reached out and have a heads up is more than what you had to do. Your friends wife has made her choice. Nothing you can do about that", "Esh she doesn\u2019t get to choose your list but you\u2019re inviting someone who might openly hate people based on groups they were born a member of. That makes you an ah to anyone you inflict him on friend to you or not. If he was just wildly passionate about weird stuff no one would care.", "NTA. He was a good friend to you when you needed it most, that counts for something and it's nice that you're inviting him to your wedding.\n\nUnless there is more going on than a disagreement over politics, FF and FFW should be able to suck it up and support you and your partner on your big day. If there's more to it than a disagreement, you should find out what it is before making a decision.\n\nBesides that, unless the wedding is a very small affair, they will probably not be forced to interact with each other anyway.\n\nMy partner and I were at a wedding a few months ago. I'm neutral about this person but my partner dislikes them quite a bit. We didn't interact with them and everything was fine.", "NTA it's your wedding, invite whomever you want.", "As it comes to the wedding itself, NAH- you can invite who you want, and anyone who has a problem with that doesn't have to go and doesn't have to be friend with you if your association with someone causes them a problem. OP you keep saying you don't want to go into specifics and that's your choice, but seeing as you're close friends with \"John\" and he's absolutely furious about it, it kinda sounds like there's more than just \"stupid facebook posts\". Something you just brush off as a phase might be a huge warning sign to other people.  \n\n\nEDIT: Have you actually talked to John or Jane in depth to find out what the big deal is?", "So are you gonna tell us what he said besides he going to vote for trump? Sounds like you\u2019re trying to downplay the situation to justify you inviting him. You\u2019re NTA for inviting him because it\u2019s your wedding but YTA for being upset she doesn\u2019t want to deal with you anymore. I want to add that the people you keep around are a reflection of your character and since you decided to side with Mr.Controversial she no longer wants to associate with you and you have no right to be mad.", "Just my two cents but you seem pretty cavilar about FFW not liking F1. There may be a reason and she may not feel confortable sharing it with you. I personally hate to be around my sis\u2019s husband and I REFUSE to let him and sis take the kids and especially for him to be alone with my kids. Do I need to give reasons or can you trust that I\u2019m justified? \n\nYour wedding, your guest list, so technically NTA, but the fact that you assume it\u2019s \u201cjust some Facebook posts\u201d and nothing more shows your lack of imagination and concern. FFW doesn\u2019t want to be around F1 and YTA for not caring or respecting that.", "NTA. I have friends with differing views that outside of that are incredible friends to me. I tried to police my friend group based on what people were posting for a few years, and it made me miserable. \n\nYou gave FF and FFW the heads up F1 would be there. YWBTA if they just showed up and were ambushed with F1, but you let them know. They have the right to react and do what they want. You have the right to invite who you want.", "NTA\n\nFFW is somehow making your wedding about her. \n\nShe was invited and made the choice not to go due to the other guests, whatever, that's her prerogative. Her getting FF to jump on you? Blocking you on socials? Over your guest list? Yuck. That's toxic. F1 was there for you in your time of need and helped you get through those difficult times. I can see why you would want your friend there to help you celebrate. \n\nCould you have had a conversation with FF about your intentions of inviting F1 earlier? Sure, but you were also dealing with your grief. You got right on the horn as soon as the official invitations went out last month and I think that is plenty of time.  Congratulations on the upcoming wedding and best of luck!", "It's your wedding and you invite who you want. NTA", "NTA, but FF and FFW absolutely are. \n\nThey are discriminating against someone for having political beliefs different than their beliefs. That \"I don't feel safe\" business is complete BS, since F1 hasn't done anything to indicate he would harm anyone. Conservative does not equal dangerous, any more than liberal equals dangerous. (of course, your friends are probably not liberal since the first line of the liberal definition is \"*willing to respect or accept behavior or opinions different from one's own; open to new ideas.*\")\n\nMaybe F1 will feel \"unsafe\" around people like FF and FFW who are so neurotic and irrational?  \n\n\nInvite whoever you want. If they choose not to come, that's dumb and immature.", "NTA\n\nEveryone else understood. I have a friend like that. I genuinely love her and our (former) friendship and history.

Set the boundaries say its your wedding and you want both there but don\u2019t be shocked by the outcome.", "Info:  What exactly did he post? The political spectrum is awfully wide and conservative Facebook post can mean anything from wanting smaller government to Qanon to hugely bigoted racist nonsense.

Not conservative myself,  but boycotting a wedding cuz one dude made some FB posts?   And insisting the groom pick different guests?

Is he going to attack her at the wedding?", "I understand \"people making me feel unsafe\", but this is a wedding. In public. The realistic bar for someone to make you feel unsafe in an event with a large number of other people is pretty high.\n\nF1, from your posts, is a Trump supporter, and I suspect that your \"pro-police\" comment actually means the sort of person who thinks that all the predominantly black people killed by police are criminals and shouldn't have been evading arrest, and they'd have been fine if they had just complied with orders.\n\nIn other words, F1 is a very stupid racist. It is not possible to engage with the data and  also believe that there isn't a widespread problem in our police agencies.\n\nBut being a stupid racist and a Trump supporter doesn't actually make anyone personally unsafe. Sure - voting for Trump, and so supporting his racist, misogynistic, homophobic policies and appointees contributes to making a large number of people less safe, but that's because of the evil nonsense he's supporting, and not because of his personal presence.\n\nAbout half the people that voted, voted for Trump.

Embrace his efforts to be a better person, I think he deserves to celebrate with you and anyone whose truly a resl friend would understand that.\n\nMy 2 cents, congratulations and take care", "John and Jane need to grow up.

I had invited a friend and his husband.  Some of my family and my fiance's were much more conservative.\n\nI had also invited a bunch of adults that had been a big part of my life when I was a kid.  Some of those adults had a huge falling out. To the point of not speaking to eachother in a few years.  \n\nI told everyone I invited that if they were to come they had to put all issues aside and be there to celebrate with me and my new wife.  I told them I was the common thread to this event. If they felt uncomfortable or could not be there for me then I respected that they would not be there.  \n\nGuess what everyone came, everyone celebrated with us. I even saw some of the people that had not spoken in years have brief conversations.  \n\nThey acted like adults.", "Naw sorry, it never just stops at \u201ctaxes should be lower\u201d lmao, the whole point of conservatism is to be part of an in group and label others as the cause of all the problems in society.", "well it's most likely the \"i don't want these groups of people in the US\"", "Did you read the post?

I do think less of people who parrot that bullshit, but it\u2019s not exactly the same as wishing real harm on others. Considering OP\u2019s friend posted them during episodes of mental illness, has since been treating that mental illness and working on himself, and agreed to OPs rules about not talking about any of that crap at the wedding, I honestly fail to see the issue. There are absolutely people who I would feel unsafe around based on their views, but the way OP describes this guy does not make me think he\u2019s one of them.\n\nEdit: I think that people who sincerely believe \u201cthe election was stolen\u201d are spreading a dangerous ideology, and there\u2019s no excuse for it. HOWEVER, it sounds like Brady was posting this stuff more to rile others up and get into fights than out of any sincere belief of those things, and if he\u2019s really changing his ways now, I don\u2019t believe that he is a dangerous person.

Got fired from multiple jobs because of it it, got evicted by his landlords (illegally, but it was a roomshare situation where the roomates felt so unsafe physically they got a group of people in to forcibly move him out. They were sleeping in shifts because they were afraid of what he would do if they all slept at the same time). Truly fucked his life.\n\nNow he's on meds and on an apology tour.

I have many people in my life that are acquaintances from my friends that are also conservative. You know what I do? Don't talk politics. If they bring it up, I leave the room or go on my phone.

If all I knew about Trump was from The Apprentice, his hotels, and his campaign ads, I could see how people could get sucked in. He seemed reasonable unless you put in the work to research him. Trumps only real talent is branding, you take someone already primed rightwing, take away calm reasoning, and add someone good at branding with a FOX News platform and you can get a relatively easy slide onto the Trump cult of personality. How cults reel people in is by slowly getting them to accept the unreasonable, then ratcheting it up; and while we see crazy express train now, the start was a kiddy caboose that could easily suck in a vulnerable undiagnosed bipolar. \n\nPeople need something to comeback to after leaving a cult to do it successfully. So we really need to make case by case judgements taking in all factors. Exactly what his beliefs are now, and how threatening they were then, do make a difference, but if every MAGA is irredeemable forever then we might as well take Marge up on the divorce decree. So the question is, was he threatening as a person or is it just that all MAGA\u2019s are threatening? This is a man who was ripe for being led by his hand into nasty beliefs. He recognizes his wrongs, is getting treatment for his BD and accepts that his attendance is subject to his behavior.", "Actually mania could make him believe it. Symptoms of mania range greatly but can include disordered thinking and delusions.", "I wouldn't be too sure about the Mania not being a cause for his belief. Mania can cause or exacerbate delusional ideas and behaviors. Some people with mania can have full blown psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and stuff). \n\nIf he was already a bit down the rabbit hole of conservative media, a big long manic episode sounds exactly like something that would push someone in. (the aggressiveness and wanting to fight is also a huge issue with mania)", "Saying that cops shouldn't be allowed to murder black people for no reason", "Probably started caring about human rights", "I am guessing he also would have the opinion that women deserve bodily autonomy. As per the debates I see under many posts, be it Reddit or IG, that gets you tagged as Ultra liberal or far left.", "No not aggressive or political anymore", "I would love to know demographically how you and your friend group works. Are the conservatives and liberals friends or are you just like a connecting point?", "Having been in OP\u2019s shoes before.  I don\u2019t think this is a case as you describe. I had a friend similar to Brady. And it was far more than \u201cjust Facebook posts\u201d. Honestly sounds like OP is running cover for some wild shit his friend said. This goes beyond labels or simple FB posts.", "Yeah. Also, the fact that OP specifically is making an effort to check for any signs or history of violence, combined with the examples given makes this seem like he\u2019s the ignorant and loud sort of conservative more than the \u201cactually dangerous\u201d conservative, so someone feeling unsafe around him also feels maybe a bit ignorant as well, coming from a liberal. Not everyone who disagrees with you is actually dangerous and the only thing that attitude breeds is division, not progress.\n\nNot saying I\u2019d want to be around him either, but\u2026. It seems kind of an overreaction that OP literally needed to go around warning all of his friends he was inviting another friend to his *wedding* so that people could bail if they wanted to. I feel like you need to be a decently shitty friend to not just ignore someone for a few hours or even just be able to say, \u201cnow isn\u2019t the place to discuss politics, let\u2019s just be happy for OP and his wife\u201d.", "I also think more INFO is needed.\n\nNormally afaik you don't have access to the whole guest list for someone else's wedding. You're also not forced to interact with every guest at a wedding. So it could be an overreaction to not attend a wedding because someone will be there who you politically disagree with.\n\nOn the other hand if Brady was posting actual threats targeting the Doe couple, then they are reasonable for not attending. Maybe it's n-a-h or maybe OP is a-h for associating with a rightwing extremist. Depending on Brady's current views and the nature of what he posted.", "Exactly. This post doesn't give the impression that Brady ever apologized or anything for what he posted. Doesn't even imply that he changed his views. Just that he realized he was being extreme in paying what he did while manic and got treatment and that he's hiding it all (which is, of course, his right as nobody has the right to his medical information).", "I missed that. If Brady still holds those views I wholeheartily agree OP is siding with hate.", "It happened to someone I know when their mania turned psychotic. It was wild. Not in a good way for anyone that was close to them.\n\nBut yeah 'normal' manic episodes do not change someones personality.", "Not necessarily. Some people with BD will also have psychosis, and all bets are off then.\n\nWith manic psychosis, one of the most common manifestations is grandiose delusions. With depressive psychosis, the more common manifestation is paranoid delusions. In both cases, hallucinations are also common.\n\nSo you take someone with untreated, undiagnosed BD who's having paranoid delusions - who believes that \"everyone is out to get me\". Maybe he doesn't know WHO is behind it, but every time a car stops or drives slow down his street, he becomes convinced that SOMEONE is watching him. So he starts looking for answers, and frankly, the Right is WAY more paranoid than the Left, so they're absolutely going to feed that paranoia. They're going to be the side telling him that he's not crazy and \"they\" really ARE out to get him, and they're going to give him several \"theys\" to be angry at.\n\nThe entirety of the Right's platform is based on paranoia. It's all fear porn. So if someone has a mental illness that makes them paranoid, it's not hard to see how they could easily get sucked into that kind of rabbit hole.", "Are you a mental health professional? Because mania can cause all kinds of strange ideas that are not at all indicative of the person\u2019s normal thinking. It can make people believe they can fly so they jump off of buildings, it can make them believe they are immortal, alien, God\u2026 it is literally temporary insanity and can cause all manner of delusions\u2026 even if that isn\u2019t how it happened for someone you know. \n\nMy brother had a good friend with BD and suddenly one day he became manic and became convinced my brother was a demon\u2014 he went to the shed and got an axe to kill him with and chased my brother around the neighborhood before finally restrained by others. Luckily my brother wasn\u2019t injured but the point is that this delusion was not just a reduction in inhibition\u2014 the friend was atheist and had no background in religion or belief in demons. It was the mania, pure and simple.", "Actually thinking/saying things that don\u2019t make sense *including political ones* is a symptom called \u201cflight of ideas\u201d and it\u2019s in the DSM-V.", "What struck me about his friends apparent mania is a comment by OP that Brady made sure not to post anything that would put his job in jeopardy. Which to me does not scream someone posting in the middle of an episode of mania. Because he evidently was completely aware of potential consequences and made efforts to avoid them.", "Weddings are also generally assigned seating.  It wouldn\u2019t be hard for OP to make sure anyone who doesn\u2019t want to interact with him wouldn\u2019t be at his table/near him.", "And I bet real life drama is a lot more tense than freaking FB posts. \u201cUnsafe\u201d Jesus people are weak", "I wasn't asking a question. He's dead now so it is a moot point. \n\nspelling Moot not mute", "Yeah there's a bit of a difference between \"WE DRANK OUT THE HOSE\" memes or \"high tax bad low tax good\" (both stupid) and an Andrew Tate video (stupid \\*and\\* dangerous)", "I asked and no one answered me and John said he was unsure but did not think so - tried to ask Jane she unfriended and blocked me before I could", "And there lies the big problem when it comes to political conversations\u2026 most people makes far too many assumptions.", "It means no...there was nothing besides the Facebook posts.  They just don't want to admit that they themselves have turned into hateful people...\nI just shake my head....really?!?   Over Facebook posts?   Just ignore them and stay away from them.", "This is a huge problem I run into with my straight male friends. I bring up instances of misogyny or red flags for misogyny and they don\u2019t see it. Or they have never noticed it until I brought it up, because they aren\u2019t targeted, they never noticed.", "\\^ Here is the exact kind of issue I'm talking about.  This insane view that everyone right of Bernie is somehow radical far right monster out to gleefully harm anyone who doesn't follow them is simply not reflective of reality and indicates being stuck in a very unhealthy fantasy world.", "How does Brady act around women? I find a lot of conservative men are polite to other men, then treat women like garbage.", "What else did he post other than saying he voted for trump to pay less tax. \n\nIf you keep being vague, you aren't going to get a true response. \n\nNo one here will be affected by your decision to omit information except for you. If you don't post the full picture of what he said that has led to this, then any answers to your questions are completely fruitless and only you will face the consequences of how you proceed. \n\nPlease be more informative and provide more examples of things he's said so everyone here can make a conclusion that has some actual substance to it. You're only letting yourself down by not doing so.", "Well, when you're getting no answers to direct questions, it shouldn't be surprising to him that you're attempting to fill in the blanks with the limited info you have.\n\nI think you've probably done the best you could given the circumstances. You informed everyone as soon as you knew Brady intended to attend and even offered to cover any costs if John and/or Jane decided to drop out.\n\nWhat's interesting about this post is that you're getting beaten up by people coming up with all sorts of hypothetical scenarios justifying Jane's actions. And yet this sub is generally all \"it's your wedding, you do what you want. Everyone else should defer to bride/groom.\" But here you are getting raked over the coals.", "I glanced at your avitar after reading \"as a person of color\" and thought: \"ah yes, blue. Wait ...\"\n\nAll joking aside, as a queer disabled woman, I can agree that depending on what specific types of conservative FB posts he was making I wouldn't feel safe either (I stopped talking to several people after reading the shit they posted on FB \"a few years ago\")", "I understand that the fact that hardcore conservatives exist can make the groups they target feel unsafe in general. \n\nHowever, unless Jane thinks that this conservative in question is going to harm her at the wedding, then she is really just refusing to go to register her anger/disappointment that OP is friends with such a person. She doesn't feel \"unsafe\" at the wedding in the true sense of the word. \n\nAnd that's fine, she's free to be angry and skip, but she doesn't get to dictate OP's guest list or demand OP clear it with her before she will agree to attend.\n\nNTA", "I agree we don't know if Brady shared their diagnosis. And while I think Brady should let people know that they were experiencing a manic episode, the reality is that it might be very difficult to share a bipolar disorder diagnosis. \n\nHopefully Brady has done the work in therapy, the medication is working and the wedding goes without anymore problems", "Only because he has been there for you and confided in you about his diagnosis and regret over former posts that at face value deserves grace. What does it say about US to not give him grace- then we as well, are huge AH. \n\nA big BUT, however, is that Brady takes it a step further with Dick and Jane privately. This has potential in the HUGE scope of the current state of affairs, to gain insight and awareness on both sides. Be interesting to learn how sincere he is and a deeper dive into Dick and Jane\u2019s reaction/friendship. \n\nIdk- super, super tough topic punctuated with wedding may be a lose, lose situation. \n\nCongratulations! Peace, health and happiness to you both! Soak up wedding day and all celebrations surrounding. Be present and grateful for all the love and support of friends and family \u2665\ufe0f", "Heck, even supporting the economic policies is still shady. Those policies are keeping too many people broke, hungry, homeless, etc.", "I'd probably still stick with no one is really an asshole here, but I'm glad Brady is getting better with help man. Deprogramming from extreme media and getting help for mental illness are both giant monsters to fight in their own rights. \n\nJohn and Jane have a right to be friends with who they want though, and it sounds like they might find this as their line in the sand.", "Thanks for this response! I definitely have people I'm around who are obnoxiously conservative who I avoid too, or we just avoid politics in general. People are definitely more than their political views, and even so, we can grow a lot by taking notes from both sides.", "OP mentioned in another comment that Jane never liked Brady because he used to date one of her friends and they had a bad breakup.\n\nI wonder if Jane knows something that might put those posts in a different light.", "Or the delightful posts about how women who have abortions should be punished.

It sounds like Brady has been an actual friend to you during a time of difficulty. Maybe he shitposted on SM for a while years ago, but his recent actions have spoken more loudly.

Now if it comes out that he\u2019s harassed, threatened others, etc. then that view point obviously changes a lot. People are allowed their differing opinions. Gonna be quite frank here cause I see a lot of conservative bashing. I am a conservative and I\u2019ve never had an issue with people, I love having conversations and hearing about different views as long as the conversation stays civil. Everyone views things differently and sometimes that can be very insightful. However, if you know he\u2019s gonna cause issues that may be a reason to reconsider. I have a very liberal cousin who has to argue with everyone, I don\u2019t mind conversing with her until she feels the need to start screaming and being combative over her views. I want to be very clear I have no issue with her views but how she comes across when she is discussing them. Yes, we do not agree with each other and that\u2019s completely okay. As long as her discussing her views does not have an affect on my well being, I don\u2019t care. When we talk about things that are potential hot topics she is very aggressive and verbally abusive as I do not agree with her. Which is not okay. I personally probably won\u2019t invite her to my wedding for this very reason, so I completely understand why you wouldn\u2019t invite him if that\u2019s how he\u2019s gonna behave. But if he can behave like an adult who has manners then I don\u2019t see the issue. So far it sounds like your other friends don\u2019t want him around because of differing opinions which is childish.

My family is a mix, there are a lot of conservatives on my dad's side, and a lot of liberals on my mom's. My immediate family is pretty liberal. I identify as a moderate. My husband's family has a lot of what I would call far-right wing conservatives, you know, the \"I watch Fox News 24/7\" and am proud of it type of folk. They love talking about how lazy my generation is, which irritates me to no end. I genuinely don't like being around my husband's family when they talk politics.   \n\n\nSo the rational thing is to exclude everyone on my family's side who I disagree with, right? NO. We had signs up at the bar and entryway saying, \"Please no politics\" and made it clear to people in advance we wanted a nice day. Everybody was on their best behavior, nobody talked politics or religion or made a scene. People that I KNOW are on polar opposite sides politically were able to talk about other things and get along.   \n\n\nToday, I have most of my husband's family in Facebook timeout where we are friends, but I don't see their posts and they can't see mine. We see them a few times a year because if you don't reign them in, they genuinely can be that unpleasant. They were CONSTANTLY sharing false biased posts on social media.

Going into 2020 with an undiagnosed mental illness? Rough. \n\nIts hard to really know how to judge Brady without really knowing what those FB posts were all about. FJB? FDT. Nancy Sucks? Mitch Sucks. Back the Blue? Black Lives Matter. Stolen election? I don't think it was, but looking at the US's track record on diplomacy and transparency I can see why people doubt. All this is to say, if this is the core of the messaging, often people on \"the other side\" (your friend Jane) often have what seem like similar mirror messages. I am not saying the Blue Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter are the same yall, they absolutely are not, but they mean different things to different people. If his messaging was more sinister? Yeah I can totally understand why Jane wouldn't want to be around that.\n\nIn the end, it sounds like he's backed off whatever that message was. He has sought treatment for his mental disorder. He was there for you in hard times. He has promised to be on his best behavior (you should still assign him an accountability buddy, especially once the booze starts flowing).\n\nWhat does your wife think? \n\nIdk if it would actually be feasible, but could/would Brady directly reach out to Jane (with notice) and apologize to her, that his previous actions made her feel unsafe and now he is in treatment and no longer holds such extreme views?

If they don't respect your choice to show affection to those who care for you, then they can choose not to come and they can refuse your affection.\n\nI also find Brady's former views abhorrent, but we must recognize that these days the political discourse is toxic and perverted, it doesn't always reflect the true nature of our hearts.\n\nIf we can't extend an olive branch when there is opportunity to do so, all we do is prolong the demented fever of division that plagues society.

But if they have personal views, even not great ones, but aren't going to start trouble with anyone, then it is ridiculous to say they can't be invited somewhere if they are the host's friend.  If you go by that rationale then going into a supermarket, the mall, a park, anywhere public, you are likely to be around people with all different views, even ones where in their head they don't like you.  It's how they act on them that is the real deciding factor.", "At the end of the day it's OP's wedding and he can invite whomever he wants.

He regrets those posts because he was manic at the time. That doesn't actually say anything about the current state of his politics and views other than maybe that he doesn't support some portion of the Right's massively broad lunatic fringe anymore. \n\nI'm not necessarily saying that I think he should be disinvited even if he's still likely to show up in a maga hat, but we have no guarantees that he isn't still someone I would want to actively avoid at the wedding.", "That's why this is hard to do evaluate (for me). If it's something like \"I don't like Nancy Pelosi,\" Jane is likely over-reacting. If it was \"over-the-top\" like Brady himself claims, it's very possible Jane had a basis for her fears especially if Brady was targeting a group she's part of.", "Yea I laughed reading that.

My guess is it has more to do with Jane being friends with Brady\u2019s ex. All of my friends hate my exes for some silly reason even if I have no issues with them.
