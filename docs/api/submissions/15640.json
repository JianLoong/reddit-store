I have good relationships with my step daughter, she likes me a lot. My husband has very bad relationships with his ex wife, they communicate only via emails, very rarely. \n\n\nSince we live overseas my step daughter was too young to visit us in our house but now she\u2019s getting older and ex wife\u2019s stepmom asked if we would like her (stepmom) to fly over with stepdaughter and stay in our house for couple weeks this summer. \nMy husband and I both thought it\u2019s a bit extreme, but he said that my decision would be final if it\u2019s something I can tolerate. I said \u201cno\u201d and suggested that there\u2019s other option to have his daughter over - for example one of us or both can fly with her, that\u2019s apart from using Arline services for assisting minors traveling alone. We both have good income so financially it\u2019s not a big deal. \n\n\nEx wife got very angry about this my decision and wrote my husband angry email saying I\u2019m AH who alienating husband from their daughter. \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682414146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ydte8/aita_for_refusing_to_host_my_husbands_ex_wifes/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're TA.", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like the ex just wants her step mother there to \u201csupervise\u201d the visit or something. I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with travel plans, especially since you guys are willing to escort her yourselves. I think this has everything to do with her just not trusting the two of you with her daughter for 2 weeks. She\u2019s also just trying to find an excuse to say that the daughter won\u2019t be allowed to visit.", "NTA. You\u2019re not alienating the dad and daughter. You offered an alternate solution, which was one or both of you could accompany her. You just don\u2019t want to have to host the ex-MIL for a couple weeks. That\u2019s reasonable. Two weeks is a long time. \n\nIt does sound like she has been good to you, so if you or your husband care about that relationship, you might want to make the sacrifice and host her.

You don't have to live with the ex-stepmother.  You are already quite god with having to socialise with her when you visit their country and have suggested other viable options.\n\nThere is no reason one of you cannot fly with the daughter or use the unsupervised minor services available. The ex-wife is just scratching for a fight about anything. Don't take the bait and just stick to your guns.", "I hardly see how you're alienating your husband from his kid when you are providing adequate alternatives. Having an additional house guest (even one you like) for a long period of time is rather tricky. I don't think Grandma needs to be there.\n\nNTA. Personally I think the ex is probably being unnecessarily difficult but it's worth ascertaining if your step daughter has perhaps voiced concerns about flying solo and someone has thought this a good option.", "NTA\n\nI come form (an admittedly odd) family where I flew alone since 12 yo (in my 30's now), my step sister did the same, my much younger brother recently started too (12 as well).

I get not wanting her in your house, but I definitely also get mom not wanting to let a 13 yearold travel out of the country without someone there.
