We planned that on Wednesday, we'd visit his parents to collect the main items of furniture (desk, tables, lamps) and some clothes. Here is where the issue starts:\n\nMy friend (F28) messaged me at 8:45 in the morning to ask me to check if her passport was in my car, as she thinks she lost it when our friends were all out together and her bag tipped over in my car spilling everything inside it. I should point out that this night out was over 2 months ago in March and this is the first time she's asked about the passport. I didn't see the message straight away as my boyfriend and I were sleeping in a little (my friend knew I was off work on leave) and when we got up, we went straight into sorting things with the house to take rubbish to the dump before bringing more of his things over. She messaged again at 12pm saying \"could I check this today\" because she needed to go for a new one tomorrow. So I messaged back at that point to say that I had been in and out of my car a lot since that night, including going in and out the back of the car with my dog and I hadn't seen a passport but that of course I would check again and have a more thorough look. \n\nThis is where I might be TA. My boyfriend and I drove through to his parents and I forgot to check the back of the car properly before leaving. When we arrived an hour later (taking separate cars for space), my dog (8month old male) had an accident in the back seat and peed everywhere. He's never done anything like it before so it was surprising. I had to stop at the nearest shop to get cleaning supplies then I cleaned my car out in the middle of a retail car park while ensuring my dog was safe. Then I drove to my boyfriend's parents house where I immediately checked the back of my car but as I suspected there was no passport. I messaged my friend to let her know after I'd checked, which didn't happen until 4:45pm but I apologised for this saying it had been a hectic day. \n\nMy friend messaged me back saying: \"I would have appreciated hearing that earlier tbh. I get it\u2019s busy but it would have taken 5 minutes. I\u2019ve spent the whole day hoping it was there so I could avoid changing our flights. Thanks for checking x\".\n\nI was a bit shocked and I know this friend can be quite prickly at times but I thought I'd completed the favour she asked - which was to check that day and I did. I also feel like I had my own plans that day that were important and I did give her a strong indication earlier in the day that it wasn't there. AITA because I didn't check my car sooner?\n\nEdit: Some commenters seem to think my friend is going on a trip soon and to be honest, I have absolutely no idea if she is. She asked me to check that day saying \"because I need to go for a new one tomorrow\". So I assumed she was getting a new passport. She only mentioned changing the flights when I told her the passport wasn't in my car. I have no other information regarding her situation other than this.", "created_utc": 1685199111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t9gy5/aita_for_not_checking_my_f28_car_sooner_for_my/", "score": 3254, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not your problem that she created this emergency. You didn't blow her off either.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the concept of a *phone call*.

You weren't sitting on your ass all day ignoring your friend, you were busy doing important stuff you'd planned to do. And then you had the unexpected clean up of your dog's accident which would have thrown you off even more.\n\nYour friend shouldn't have booked a flight not knowing where their passport was. Just like you shouldn't book a flight not knowing if it's in date or not. If they chose to wait two months before asking you to look, then that's on them. If they literally just realised they don't have their passport in its usual place, that's also not your problem.

She could have driven over to look herself while you guys were busy at one of the houses. Sounds to me like she's just upset because SHE screwed up and is taking it out on you.", "Seems like the comments are a bit divided. I'll go with NTA. For a couple reasons:\nFirst of all: the passport had been lost for 2 months apparently. Even if you don't have immediate travel plans you should always try to check if all your documents are there after a night out. ESPECIALLY IF YOU TIPPED YOUR BAG OVER AT SOME POINT.\nSecond: You had plans, big plans, you checked your car, you saw it wasn't there, checking again is a courtesy not a necessity. If it were your friend should've made plans to make sure. Called if she thought it was taking long or ANYTHING really. Alas she didn't. Her responsibility in the end really. so NTA.", "NTA. She's the one who left it to the last minute to ask. Last time I had to move furniture/do a dump run after I moved apartments, I forgot to eat.

A form of government ID. And losing it in March wasn't a sign to panic?", "NTA her passport is not your responsibility. You checked just not as fast as she wanted.", "NTA. Friend asked you to check that day, and you did. She didn't suggest any urgency, just that she needed to make an appointment to get a new one. There was nothing on you. \n\nIf someone has their passport on a night out, it is their responsibility to make sure it is still with them the next day. She could have dealt with this months ago.", "NTA \u201cfailure to plan on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine\u201d. She was missing her passport for months and then decided it was an emergency and everyone needed to drop what they were doing to check. You checked when you remembered.", "NTA\n\nYou still checked on the same day.   She asked for you to check that day, didn't specify a time, and then complained that you should have answered sooner. \n\nNothing in this story indicates she would have been able to do anything about starting the process of getting a new passport if she'd found out earlier that same day.", "NTA, it definitely would have been nice to have done it right away, but also she waited 2 months and didn\u2019t communicate how urgent her request was", "NTA - You are busy with your own stuff, I get it's important and she was worrying, sure it would have only taken '5 minutes', but you had other stuff going on and you did look that day. I don't think it was right of her to passive aggressively text you like that but i can understand she was worried and frustrated, but she needs to realise other people can't always just drop what they're doing. You apologised it was late and explained.\n\nIt sounds like she was going to get a new one anyway, I guess having the old one would just speed up the process? But it wouldn't make much of a difference to the process tine which is a few weeks at least.\n\nEta: I think this is something you guys can just sweep under the rug. You apologised and explained, she thanked you and honestly said that she was a bit frustrated. I don't think this is anything to make into an issue or anything, just maybe send another text saying you understand her point of view ?", "Definitely NTA. Not only did they not bother asking you to check until last minute when you already have all this other stuff you're doing, but they were already planning to get a new one the next day. That means they're already planning for it to be completely lost, why would it matter what time you checked your car? Let's play through a few scenarios.\n\n12PM: \"Hey I checked and it's not there\" Friend is going to get a new passport the next day\n\n4PM: \"Hey I checked and it's not there\" Friend is going to get a new passport the next day\n\n9PM: \"Hey I checked and it's not there\" Friend is going to get a new passport the next day\n\nThere's no reason for your friend to act like that.", "NTA.\n\nIt's entirely her fault for losing her passport in the first place.\n\nThere's also nothing wrong with not looking at your texts right away. Or being busy with the tribulations of life.\n\nTbh I think 5 hours is a decent span of time to check your car for her passport (considering you saw the message at 12PM), and she said by the end of the day. Had she said \"can you check within the hour\" you'd be in the wrong but \"by the end of the day\" makes it sound as if it wasn't very pressing. She didn't make her expectations clear and then got mad.\n\nShe should've asked you a long time ago to check for her passport if she's going on a trip, or just if she's thinking of renewing. You can't really expect someone to be free to do something for you at a moments notice.\n\nEdit: I'm also surprised and really irritated by all the YTA replies. Why anyone would think that is beyond me. Jesus Christ, your friend asked you to do something, and so you did, even if you had a stressful day. Your friend actually didn't have the right to be prickly, she lost HER fucking passport. No one lost that for her, and she waited for the last minute to ask you to check. People in these comments are senseless. It feels like your friend made 30 different fake accounts just to comment and upvote herself. Wtf.", "YTA.  You write:\n\n\"She messaged again at 12pm saying \"could I check this today\" because she needed to go for a new one tomorrow.

Seriously. She realized a day before she needed it that it might be in your car. This is on her.

NTA\n\nShe's going on a trip that requires a passport, knew she lost it, and waited to the last minute to ask for help.\n\nShe didn't fully inform you about the trip, so how were you supposed to know how important it was? She also knew you had a busy day... when does the understanding go both ways?\n\nThis is a PASSPORT. She didn't lose her class schedule, or an appointment card... a passport. She should have been way more concerned and proactive about this the last 2 months.\n\nAlso, how far away does she live? If she was expecting to find it THAT DAY, maybe she should have dropped by, since she would need to collect it from you anyway if it was there. So she either wasted a bunch of time, or was she expecting you to drop it off to her on your busy moving day?\n\n\nAt the end of the day, this was her responsibility, not yours. And it's not your fault she waited until the last minute... exactly when you weren't in a position to help. It's bad timing, and yea, maybe you could have done it sooner, but she could have also texted you maybe a couple days earlier when she wasn't hours away from getting a new passport.", "NTA - you said you\u2019d check that day and you did.

Surely you didn\u2019t really think any time before 11:59 pm was okay?\n\nSure, she should\u2019ve asked you to check your car sooner, but if a friend asked me about something so important and time-sensitive I wouldn\u2019t put off a 5-minute task for so long.

It happened several months ago so obviously you wouldn\u2019t assume it was in your car. She chose to wait to the last minute to message you, you didn\u2019t see the first message and you were busy during the other one. Life happens and you get distracted. At least you eventually did look. It\u2019s crazy that anyone thinks you\u2019re an AH.", "NTA she lost her passport *2 months ago* and is just now making it a priority for you.

You need six weeks MINIMUM before traveling to get a passport because that's how long it takes to order and have it delivered to your home. You don't get a passport the same day you apply for it. If OPs friend is planning a trip to Mexico this weekend she's in for a rude surprise because it's not happening. Her 5-hour delay in checking the car has literally no impact on how long it's going to take her friend to get that new passport I assure you.", "NTA. if it was that important she would've asked you before. not your fault she left it to the last minute.", "NTA. You were busy as hell (do people just block out how stressful and difficult moving is??) and she could\u2019ve asked you to check it more than the absolute last day before she needed it. Plus you got back to her in the later afternoon, not at midnight. You said you\u2019d check that day and you did. And it wasn\u2019t even in your car anyway! I don\u2019t understand how someone could need a passport *that* badly while also not asking their friend to look for it until the last possible minute.", "NTA she had two months but needed you to drop everything that second to look?\n\nNo way", "NTA I am honestly so surprised to see so many YTA votes. Your friend, knowing she had a trip coming up, waited 2 months to figure out where her passport was. You were having a crazy busy day and couldn't get to it until the afternoon. Her lack of preparation should not equal an emergency on your part. \n\n(Edited to clarify my vote)", "[deleted]", "NTA. Your friend is incredibly irresponsible. \n\nSeveral weeks have passed. Her emergency is not your job. You're doing important stuff, you checked same day as asked through a stressful day. She did not make it know it was urgent and then apologize for her screw-up, putting you on the spot. \n\nDon't you dare further apologize to that silly, immature twit.", "NTA\nA lack of planning on her part does not constitute an emergency on yours. \n\nYou had other things going on and still got the task completed that day (which is what she had asked).", "NTA.

I have a flight to X country in 6 weeks and just realized I can't find it. Can you check before this afternoon or I have to get a new one and pay and expedite fee or change the flights?\" No she did not.

Even after a complete move, I can tell you where it is in my new house. Your friend sounds really irresponsible. Who plans to go on an international trip and only thinks to look for it a day before their flight. This is not your fault.

I also don't fault op for not deep searching her car when she was in the middle of moving and had only planned to be moving. Why are the friend's plans more important than op's? Cause the friend left obtaining a passport until the last minute? Sure op had planned in advance to use this day for moving specifically because they hadn't been able to in the previous weeks but that needs to go on the back burner cause someone else didn't want to send 1 or 2 text messages during the time span of 2 months.\n\nIt's not like the friend messaged 2 months ago and op is the one that put off answering for the whole 8 weeks. It's the friend that delayed getting knowledge of the passport she can't be pissed that op waited like 12 hours to tell her when the friend literally waited over 1400 hours since the day she spilled all of her shit to even ask if her passport was in ops car. I don't know about you but generally if I'm going on a trip I'm gonna  double check that I have everything I need 1 month before _and probably triple check 2 weeks before_ I'm scheduled to leave.

I'm not packing months before a trip but if I might need my passport for it you bet your ass I'm checking to make sure I know where it is far in advance. The fact that she's mad at OP for not checking sooner even though OP still didn't have it means she was banking on OP to have it and didn't plan on not having it, if it's that urgent don't just say check today, call them, give them a time frame, 4:45pm is not the same as 11:59pm.

Everyone\u2019s assuming that it\u2019s been missing for two months, but since it *wasn\u2019t* in OP\u2019s car, we don\u2019t know that it has been missing for so long.

The message OP conveyed suggests they were disappointed, and that they wished OP had checked sooner so they weren\u2019t in limbo hoping that it would be in OP\u2019s car. That\u2019s it. They\u2019re not yelling and screaming and swearing at OP or anything.

Of course they want to know sooner rather than later if they need to go to that appointment or if their passport is found.\n\nI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s not common sense that if someone asks you to look for an important item like a passport (or driver\u2019s license, credit card, etc), the kind and courteous thing to do would be to check quickly. Not several hours later when it\u2019s finally just coincidentally convenient for you. OP had no reason for not checking sooner, and said in a comment that if their friend had *called* they would have immediately gone to look. Which is ridiculous.

I'm on call for work and if someone ask me for a favor on the weekends I'm on call, it might not happen. Heck, I've gone to work at 8am and came home at 12am because of work hours. When these things happen (can you check x for xyz), unless you specify that it is super urgent, it might not happen right away, and it might take a day or 2 to get back.
