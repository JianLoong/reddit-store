Before they were together, venting is fine. But venting after that stage becomes tricky and puts your friend in the middle.

Venting to a different trusted person would have been a better choice. \n\nShe\u2019s hormonal and in a terrible predicament. Getting her mind off of your brother would have been a wiser choice.

That\u2019s staying out of it. Let him figure his own shit out. She\u2019s choosing to remain out of contact for at least the duration of her pregnancy and that\u2019s wise if he and your father are treating her like that. Because if they\u2019re saying that shit, they\u2019re also treating her like that without words.\n\nYou guys are best friends and it was @sshole for your brother and father to put you in that predicament by saying that shit in front of you.

It\u2019s a tough situation. \n\nI\u2019m also gonna add, given your brother\u2019s history, there\u2019s a good possibility he\u2019s been unfaithful. Maybe that\u2019s why he up and broke up with her, he found someone else to move on to, but now he\u2019s stuck. Sometimes the one who\u2019s throwing out accusations of cheating without cause, is often times the one who\u2019s guilty of cheating.\n\nETA- I haven\u2019t looked into this\u2026 but isn\u2019t it possible for you to give a sample of your DNA?", "NTA Protect your friend and baby from him and your dad.", "[deleted]", "It's like he had his toy taken away and he's mad that he can't kick her around anymore.", "And yet he refuses the DNA test.\n\nYou know why?

This prevents women in my sister's situation from leaving because the court literally ignored hospital records to make this decision. Custody and visitation was her ex's favorite game, and he does not talk to his daughters now that they are old enough he can't play those games anymore.

We're not told he broke off the relationship in anger. All we're told is\n\n>breaking up with her suddenly and blocking her from contacting him\n\nThere are plenty of reasons that people do that. Some of them damn silly.\n\nYou make up stuff that's not in the post. You didn't understand the information that was in the post.
