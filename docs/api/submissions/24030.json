He dated my best friend for 4 years before breaking up with her suddenly and blocking her from contacting him. I knew it was a bad idea for them to date because my best friend was pretty na\u00efve and sheltered before dating him and had never been in a relationship in her life even though she was in her 20s. As much as I love my brother, he had a reputation for breaking hearts and sleeping around so I wanted to protect her from him but I couldn\u2019t do anything without them hating me. I thought maybe my brother had changed and that he actually loved her since his relationship with her was the longest he\u2019s ever been with one person and he seemed so different around her but obviously it was just an act since I had to be the one to break her pregnancy news to him since he made it impossible for her to speak to him.\n\nEver since finding out my brother keeps saying \u201cif the baby is his\u201d even though she\u2019s only ever slept with him. I blame my dad for putting the idea in his head since my dad was never supportive of his relationship with my best friend so I know he\u2019s mad deep down that she\u2019s pregnant. I know it\u2019s been hurting my best friend that he keeps saying that because she\u2019s told him they can do a paternity test if it\u2019s what he wants but it\u2019s him (and my dad) that are stalling. She finally snapped and told my brother and family that if anybody said \u201cif the baby is his\u201d again she\u2019d leave and cut contact so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about her or her baby again.\n\nThey both stopped saying it in front of her but my brother slipped up and said it in front of me when speaking to my dad. I was angry on her behalf and I told him off for continuing to hurt her even though the only mistake she made was falling for his bullshit. I was ranting with my friend about him and she asked me if he said it again so I told her because I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her. She told me couldn\u2019t do this anymore and that she was going to stay with her aunt until the baby was born.\n\nNow my brother is freaking out because she won\u2019t respond to him and he has no idea where she\u2019s gone. He asked me where she is and I told him I couldn\u2019t tell him so he asked me to at least tell him why she left. I told him it was because of what he said and somehow my dad and brother have turned it onto me because \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told her\u201d. My dad keeps saying my brother is my brother so I needed to take his side and tell him where she is but my best friend is a sister to me and I don\u2019t want them to keep hurting her so I won\u2019t no matter how many times my brother says he knows he's been a bastard and wants a second chance to fix things with her. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691334905, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15js29u/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_exmy_best_friend_he/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know you trust your friend but don\u2019t underestimate the possibility that even the most innocent can lie.\n\nIf he wants to question paternity, that\u2019s his business. Of course, saying it repeatedly in front of her is an AH move. But he stopped in front of her. You went and tattled like a small child when he slipped up in your hearing.\n\nLet me repeat, why exactly are you in the middle of their relationship?\n\nOh and why are you adding drama to an already stressful situation?", "This sounds like a harlequin romance....", "Every man who is approached by an ex with a pregnancy should be a bit skeptical.

Getting knocked up *does not* increase the chances that you are being unfaithful to your partner. \n\nDragging your feet to get a paternity test says a lot.
