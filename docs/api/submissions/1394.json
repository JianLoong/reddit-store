Why did you assume that would be covered? And who did you assume was covering it? Your uncle us the one who said he would pay so much wouldn't you check with him to see what's okay?", "NTA\n\nI do think you need to find out exactly who has paid for what for this cruise. It sounds like you thought your uncle was paying for everything. I\u2019m wondering if your parents have picked up a lot of the tab for you & your sister. It\u2019s one thing if your parents are paying for the excursion as your Xmas gift - it\u2019s something else if they\u2019ve paid for a lot of other stuff & now think you\u2019re mooching. You\u2019re NTA either way, but you should figure this out.", "NAH I believe there was a lot of missed communication. You were wrong to assume everything was paid and especially to pass this info forward to ur sister without confirming. But the family could also had a moment to agree and organize the traveling expenses and what each person is responsible of. It\u2019s a learning lesson, but I agree, next time check the info don\u2019t assume", "I feel like someone should\u2019ve outright explained the full situation to you. Just imagine if you found out while on the cruise\u2026wouldn\u2019t turn out too well. \ud83d\ude2c", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re 25 and responsible for yourself. Be grateful you got the trip itself covered.", "NTA.\n\nWhen someone says they are taking you on a cruise, that implies they are paying.  Yes, drink packages are extra.  Yes, excursions are extra but they encouraged you to look at them (and thereby implying do some).  However, they didn't seem to say that you were on your own for excursions.\n\nNow, I'm guessing any souvenirs or on-shore dining may be on your own dime.", "We need more info. If your uncle said he was taking everyone then why is your mom involved?", "YTA for assuming and also for telling your sister and getting her hopes up.\n\n\nI had a similar situation this past August. My father-in-law paid for all of his kids, kid's spouses, and grandkids (16 of us!) to go on a cruise. Not once did it enter my mind that he would be paying for any extras - that is just such entitled thinking.", "Also, unrelated to your original question, but as you stated your new to this\u2026.. IF you leave the boat for whatever reason, absolutely one hundred and ten percent be back on the boat EARLIER than the stated time. Delays on the way back from wherever you are can happen and that boat will absolutely leave without you right on schedule.", "NTA, my grandparents did this for our family. I have no idea who paid for what. Grandkids were older(20s)  and took our own money, but there was a couple activities that we went on and didn\u2019t pay for. We were all working and had jobs mind you. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why your mom wouldn\u2019t make it clear that you would have to pay in the original question. \u201c hey if you want to do anything extra, make sure to look at prices and see if you can afford it because it\u2019ll be on you..", "Never assume. Ask first. YTA for thinking a well-off uncle would pay for your cruise.", "Did you assume they were paying for everything, or did you assume this was all inclusive. \nJust about everything costs extra.\nYou're young, so I'll rack it up to that,  but you would have been safer to ask instead of hoping/assuming.", "NTA, better to know now than when you\u2019re on the cruise. I\u2019d save up for the extra things you\u2019d like to do before you go. If they pay for more than what was given then you are ta", "Yta\n\n\nHonestly to assume things. Those extras cost a lot.\n\n\n\nYou don't get to spend someone else's money.\n\n\nNext time don't assume and ask. And be prepared to cover the cost.\n\n\nCruises have the basic then they can add in extras like fine dineing or those outside activities. \n\n\nYour pretty bold to assume they would take that cost because it could add potentially 1000s to the cost. Depending on how many people are going.", "ESH.  It is everyone\u2019s responsibility to communicate what they are paying.  You are an asshole for assuming everything would be included but so are your mom and uncle for not being up front about what is included and what is not included.   I vacation with my sisters and father every year since my mom died so he has someone to travel with.  I usually do the planning and I am very explicit about costs for each person.", "INFO: If your uncle was taking you on a cruise as a gift, I'm confused why you thought your mother would be paying for things.", "NTa\n\n>she half jokingly asked if I thought that everything I did on this cruise was going to be on someone else\u2019s dime.\n\n\"No, just the things I was invited to and asked to seek out.\"", "YTA. It\u2019s a little insane to assume literally everything would be paid for, and then telling your sister that without actually discussing it with anyone. I\u2019d assume the cruise itself was paid for-anything else I would not make assumptions about.", "NTA... It was a more than valid assumption considering she requested that you look into the excursions.", "INFO: How exactly did your uncle and his husband word that they were taking you all on the cruise. And how well off are they?", "This can't be just me. If you are 25 you are very much responsible for your own money...\n\nGonna go for ESH. You know that you are an adult now and should take care of your own things. That also includes asking who pays what.. Your parents should have talked about it years ago...\n\nSo welcome to aldulthood!", "I don't think your assumption was unreasonable, the way she asked you to look, especially since she said she wasn't planning to go on any excursions. But why not just have that conversation? \n\n\"Hey mom, I feel bad for assuming you were paying for excursions, I'm happy to pay for that myself, I guess I just thought since you were suggesting it, you were kind of offering. Sorry for the misunderstanding.\" \n\nNTA", "YTA", "Never having been outside the U.S. or going on a cruise could be confusing. Your family should have been more specific about the cost upfront. If I was treating, I would have said, \"We thought this would be a great opportunity for our family. While we want to treat you to the cruise, extra alcohol bought, excursions you want to do, photos, food charges not included in your fare, will be your responsibility. If you have any questions about the trip, please ask.\" Tips can run quite a bit. That is more than generous on their part and a very gentle YTA for expecting everything be given to you. Go on the cruise, have a great time, and come back wiser.", "If someone said I'm taking you on a cruise yeah I'd assume they were paying for it. Not for my souvenirs while out exploring or snacks if I wanted something but yeah cruise related things I'd assume it was being covered by them. NTA", "I was aware that it cost extra, yes. I assumed it would be covered because everything up to that point had been paid for by someone else and no one requested a dime from me. This includes very expensive flights and a drink package. I knew that some of the financial responsibility had been shifted to my grandparents and parents as well. Like my grandma got hotel rooms for the night before. My mom had also mentioned not decorating or getting gifts for the Christmas holiday (the cruise is Christmas Eve through New Year\u2019s Eve of this year) so I (wrongly) assumed that this would be a \u201cgift\u201d.", "I agree, I typically have a hard time understanding certain things if they\u2019re not explained directly to me.

I assume the uncle is paying for everyone to be there but the mother is paying for the extras.", "She\u2019s been coordinating all the flights and sending me links to create accounts.

The extra cost would\u2019ve been less than $500", "Honestly, she\u2019s the one who told me to look at excursions to begin with.

There is WAY too much info missing to make a judgment.", "My uncles just bought a second home and both make 6 figures.", "That\u2019s the thing, they offered to pay for an alcoholic beverage package for me and I turned it down ($600). I now understand I shouldn\u2019t have assumed but they had offered to pay for other extras.", "For that one thing you wanted to do.\n\n\nWhat about the rest of the group. Gotta love how you started your post with not entitled haha.\n\n\nDenial", "She's helping organize activities. That doesn't mean she's paying for them. Your assumption was faulty (but doesn't put you in A H territory). Just check in next time. NAH", "Just don\u2019t go on the excursions then. If you really feel bad about the assumption, change your plans and just enjoy the paid for cruise.", "She probably wanted to know so she could book it in advance. She obviously didn\u2019t know OP assumed everything was being paid for by someone else.", "I stand by my statement. Unless mom specifically said \u2018pick out an activity and I\u2019ll pay\u2019, I would think she was just pointing out what activities were available, and to tell her if I (in OPs position) was doing one in case she decided to join.", "So what, you are entitled to their money?
