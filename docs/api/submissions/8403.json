It sounds completely unreasonable for your sister to kick her siblings out of a funeral for their shared father.

What about your sister?  Just because if she was close to him while you hadn't seen him in a decade that'd make a difference.\n\nAlso, why are you estranged?  There's also a difference between \"my sister's a homophobe so we don't talk\" and \"I and my entire family 'accidentally' insult her every time we meet\".\n\nFor that matter, what was the insulting thing your daughter said?  A fifteen year old is well past the age to be innocently insulting, which suggests it wasn't all that 'accidental'.\n\nReally based on the post it seems like your sister is an AH for the way she reacted (which would be out of line and extreme in virtually all circumstances) and your brother is an innocent bystander who got caught in the crossfire, but there's not really enough information to make a judgement about *you*.", "You are not saying A LOT here.", "INFO: What exactly did your daughter say to your sister?", "INFO: Why does your sister hate you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: IF you don't tell us, then YTA for not telling us the truth.", "INFO\n\nWhy does your sister hate you and why did she cut you off?

Otherwise, YWBTA for not telling us.", "NTA. It's incredibly messed up for anyone to make someones funeral about your relationship with someone else who attends. They are like a trustee with the respect of a party unable to represent themselves and from this not trustworthy.  You fund a funeral you do so knowing it's not \"your party\", it's something you do for the deceased,everyone who knew them as much of yourself. They should be big enough of a person to just avoid a sibling they don't like instead of making a Jerry Springer moment. Rudest/worst place for that and I'm sure all friends,coworkers,neighbors,etc... not involved in the personal drama were appalled by all of it on that level. \n\nYour sister did everyone who showed up there a huge disrespect. Emotions are expected, but not reality tv level personal drama. \n\nUnless something is being left out. It's possible to show up dressed so offensively or give a speech condemning the deceased or something like where you'd be shown the door. \n\nAlthough for your entire family to agree with it there has got to be a real bad beef. I could see it where many of them just want to keep the peace and not be mixed up in the drama and \"abstaining\", and maybe calling that being against you (not really, just an adult not seeking involvement like a kid just watching it all play out). But if they were all vocal and saying leave for actual agreement then there must be some terrible beef and they are all showing the same disrespect despite how much $ they chipped. But there is clearly something to that history, it's just the respect of a funeral should have been > than it for every last one of them. \n\nI don't think you an asshole as stated. Brave and walking into a bunch of piranaha's hoping to grieve on the other side as described. I just have a hard time believing they could show such unity w/o something major. In the past, present (rude drunk speech), etc...", "I was pretty estranged from my father when I was younger, mostly because of both the high expectations as well as sexist attitudes he had toward me. \n\nBeing my father\u2019s first child (and as well as my father having me at a young age of 18), he wasn\u2019t the best father figure and he was always too hard on me. Always forcing me study hard, always pushing me to do too many extracurricular activities, always pushing me to get A\u2019s and scholarships, trying to prevent me from having relationships and also limiting my friend groups, and eventually pushing me to do all of the housework *and* babysit my own siblings because it\u2019s \u201cgood motherhood\u201d training. Just very controlling in general. \n\nI ended up leaving my home as soon as I turned 18 and left for college and went very LC with my father, and I think this is around the time that me and my sister\u2019s relationship ended up becoming pretty sour for some reason. I think that I would have gone complete NC if it want for me wanting to be updated on how my brother was doing; who was the only one that I had a good relationship with.\n\nI think it was around the time that I got married to my husband and ended up having children of my own that my father and I ended up repairing our relationship just a little bit. Before he died, my father and I would have bi-monthly video chats where he would be talking to me and our children over the video, and I ended up forgiving my father for being so hard because he explained his over-controlling behaviors as him wanting me not to repeat his mistakes as well as him testing the water since I was his very first child. \n\nBut my sister and I never was able to improve on our relationship for some reason after I left for college. And it became even worse when she was introduced to our children, who she claimed she hated because they were just being slightly difficult for her liking is what I like to believe.", "I commented this in another post, but the short answer is that I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly the reason why.\n\nI think it could be that I messed up as a sister. It could be a her problem, and she is going through something. \n\nI really wish I knew.", "I mean \u201ctoxic\u201d as in that my sister wishes that me and my whole family (husband and children) would basically be dead. I think I messed up a bit as a sister on my side, but I never knew what I specially did to her that made her hate me *so badly* that she wished that I would be dead. \n\nOh, and my daughter just made a very innocent comment of wondering why a child was greeting people and where the irresponsible adult who was planning the funeral suppose to be, which said \u201cchild\u201d was actually my sister. I guess my sister got mad, because she always had a complex about how young she looked (even when she was an adult), and so she got offended by my daughter\u2019s comment.", "I know right?! I would assume that at a funeral, she would be more well-behaved and civil at least! \n\nAlthough, I don\u2019t think everyone agrees that they want me *dead,* but everyone there somehow agreed that she had the right of way because no one believes me and our brother that we helped pay for the funeral costs. Even though we did.\n\nSo, by their \u201creasoning,\u201d since she planned and paid for the funeral; she gets to decides who goes to the funeral or not.

But doesn\u2019t elaborate why.\n\nShe also doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with our brother either (although she was of talking stage with him, no longer though after our father\u2019s funeral), and even *he* doesn\u2019t know why she is so hateful and angry all the time.", "Do the rest of the family share your late father's views on gender roles?\n\nIt's very probable that when you left, your father alienated your sister about you, influenced her to think you abandoned her and your allocated role.", "Your daughter\u2019s comment doesn\u2019t sound innocent; it sounds inappropriate and insulting. It\u2019s unfortunate your daughter felt she could voice such a thing at the funeral. Since the rest of the family agreed you should leave shows they thought your family was ready to start drama at your father\u2019s funeral.\n\nIt sounds like your sister has made mean comments about your family in the past, so I can\u2019t say the problems are all your fault. But your daughter felt free to start a problem on the day of your father\u2019s funeral. You empowered and defended her. Maybe if you had apologized for your daughter\u2019s bad behavior things would have ended differently.", "What exactly happened between you two? No vagueness, no skirting around facts, just the bare facts so we can judge this conflict.

Not. At. A. Funeral. Least of all your own father's. That's basic decency. Sorry that happened to you.", "Then I would say NTA. It sounds like she needs serious mental health intervention, to be acting so abusive towards you and your family. My guess would be your extended family didn\u2019t want her to turn her ire on them, and they didn\u2019t feel close enough to having a say at the funeral to defend you, unfortunately.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I do believe people can be that abusive for little reason, despite what other people are saying. My own brother has told me to off myself, just because he was angry and wanted to take it out on me. It\u2019s very upsetting, and I\u2019m sorry she is being so abusive toward you and your family, and your brother too.", "I think that was how it was at first. \n\nI do admit that I probably wasn\u2019t a very good sister to her when I was living with her. I was a teenager being pressured to \u201craise\u201d two young kids and I think I accidentally put more pressure onto her than I did with her brother due to internalize misogyny on my half. \n\nOur relationship wasn\u2019t really that great for the start, but at least it was good enough that my sister would be willing to talk to me and treat me with some kind of respect. \n\nBut I think me leaving her at such a young age affected her, because I was basically her only \u201cmother figure\u201d since her own mother passed away giving birth to her and I was placed on \u201cmommy duties\u201d by my own father. \n\nAt least, that\u2019s what I believed since my brother was angry with me leaving at first, but he eventually forgave me. But I wasn\u2019t able to reconcile with my sister since the day I left home.", "But my daughter did end up apologizing for it.\n\nMy sister just somehow thought it wasn\u2019t a good enough apology and demanded that be one of the reasons why we all should leave the funeral.", "I think the problem is they don\u2019t actually know what they did to make her this mad.", "Well, my daughter hadn\u2019t seen her aunt in a very long time, and she was very concerned about it since she was worried about why a \u201cchild\u201d was taking care of everything so she made an innocent mistake!\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that my daughter meant it in a malicious manner, and she did apologize for it when I corrected her and she realized that she was wrong! For some reason though, my sister didn\u2019t find that apology acceptable at all, so she made a huge scene about it and used that as one of the excuses to get us kicked out!\n\nI think that\u2019s a bit insane to me.", "Thank you for the condolences. I appreciate it.", "This. \n\nI really don\u2019t know why my sister ended up hating me so badly, because I don\u2019t think I ever did anything that warrants our relationship to be *so* bad that she wants me to be dead!"]}
