At this point, I am starting my second week. \n\nYesterday I pull into the gym and I see the owner--we'll call her Michelle (60F)-- come out and head straight to me. Michelle tells me that there\u2019s a woman--we'll call her Jess (30-something F)-- working out in there who mentioned that she met me on a dating app. Michelle was worried that my presence would make her uncomfortable.  When Michelle asked me if I remember Jess I told her I do remember her slightly but I wasn\u2019t sure whether I should say hi so I didn't. Michelle told me that she figured that is what's happening here. I told her if Jess is there I'll talk to her, and Michelle told me she's in the gym now. I talked to Jess and we cleared the air for the time being. I think given that the conversation was a surprise to me, I didn't have time to think about it in the moment,  but on reflections a lot of things struck me as off.\n\nSo Jess and I never actually met prior to this, let alone went on a date.  In fact the reason why this is a thing was we had initially bonded over a shared love of lifting (she had a lifting video on her profile, which I interacted with). I told her I was moving to the area in a couple of months for work and I'm looking for a gym. Somehow The Swolly Mammoth came up (not sure if she or I brought it up first, but I knew about the gym long before I met her). She mentions that she works out there. A few messages later she tells me that if I were to choose Swolly Mammoth, she would not want to continue dating because the community there is important to her, and she does not want things to be weird if we were not to work out. I said that I understand it's an important boundary for her, and I would respect that boundary. I also made it clear that I have not yet chosen a gym--I had not even had an apartment pinned down--so this whole conversation could be moot. That said, for other reasons I deleted my profile. That was the last contact we had until last week. This whole conversation happened at least 4 months ago, if not 5.\n\nFast forward to last week. I start my workout program at this gym, and in one of the workouts I notice someone who I thought looked familiar. I thought about approaching her and saying high but I decided it against it for two reasons 1) She most likely would not remember me and 2) I'm a strange man approaching a woman at the gym. I just won't do that. \n\nHere is where I am wondering whether I am the asshole. I don't understand how such brief communications from months ago that didn't go anywhere would form the basis for a kind of suspicion that I would make her uncomfortable. And given that working out is supposed to be peaceful for me, I now feel uncomfortable because I now have to guard against being perceived as a threat.\n\nFWIW, I ran it by a couple of women friends and they said I'm NTA. I'm also going to talk to Michelle in a couple of hours as well.", "created_utc": 1692729765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yem0j/aita_for_making_a_woman_uncomfortable_at_the_gym/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why did you stop talking?\n\nI think you have to realize that from her perspective, this is kind of weird. You guys didn't date but talked previously, and during this conversation she mentioned the gym she works out at. Five months later, you show up and start working out at this very same gym. It IS kind of weird. If I were her, I would be just as wary. It seems like a bit too much of a coincidence. I'm sure there are tons of gyms in the area, so she may feel it's weird you are now working out at the same gym as her.", "Probably half the people in there are single and looking to date through the convenience of dating apps.  Maybe she should go to an all female gym, if your going to worry about running into guys you\u2019ve talked to on dating apps. He didn\u2019t approach her or talk to her, so why would she complain. \n\nDepending on the dating profile location, guess what, people can be from your area and not have it as their location. Like putting the capital city name, instead of exact suburb.", "NTA - if anything, Jess is the AH", "If I am understanding the situation right. NTA. You arent doing anything wrong, just going to a gym (presumably) nearby work/home to work out. You arent there for that person and you arent even interacting with them.", "NTA, she indicated that she wouldn't be against you joining that gym. Although I can understand why she felt uncomfortable.", "NTA, but consider that she might fear that you joined that gym because she works out there. Which isn\u2019t the craziest of thoughts and would be a tiny bit creepy. So I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d say she\u2019s done anything wrong either.", "She probably thought you were a stalker, OP. Don't be shitty about it. She's just trying to be safe.", "NTA. It seems like this has been blown out of proportion a little bit. It\u2019s been 4-5 months since you last talked, sounds like you barely talked to begin with, and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s evident by how you look and what you do at the gym that you have been going to a gym for a while and would need a new one if you moved.\n\nI could understand her maybe feeling a little cautious when she first saw you because unfortunately there are crazy people out there, and even if you told her you\u2019d been looking at that gym already when she told you she went there, it\u2019s not unheard of for men to lie in a like \u201coh yeah I was totally planning to do that too\u201d type way as an excuse to get closer to you. But given the amount of time that\u2019s passed and the fact that you didn\u2019t even try to interact with her when you were there, it seems like a bit of an overreaction to me. Maybe she\u2019s had someone stalk her to the gym before or since you talked to her. Maybe she told the gym owner about her apprehension just as a friend and didn\u2019t really intend for her to do anything about it unless something happened but she jumped the gun. \n\nI would just go about your normal routine and avoid talking to her unless she talks to you first. Not that you should have to, because it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve done anything wrong, but if you can easily switch around your routine to avoid being there at the same time it might be worth it just for your own peace of mind (although directly asking her when she\u2019s there could obv be taken the wrong way so I\u2019d avoid that). If it was just a little nervousness she had that got blown out of proportion I\u2019m sure everyone will realize soon enough that you\u2019re just a dude who picked a good gym. If she really is freaked out that someone she had a brief conversation with several months ago on a dating app (where the whole point is to meet people in your area with similar interests) picked the same popular gym to work out at, and the owner and/or other patrons also think it\u2019s worth making a big deal about, it might not be a place you want to be part of anyways.", "NTA, you even didn't approach her when you thought she looked familiar because you wanted to avoid being \"that guy\"", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would YOU care if someone was uncomfortable due to dating you some time ago?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMichelle was the Ah for even approaching you about that.", "NTA - I'm sure in her world you came to this gym specifically for her, because who would do anything if not for her?\n\nJust work out and pretend like you don't know who she is.", "NTA", "NAH, if you're telling the truth, you have no ill intentions, but you have to understand that women get stalked all the time, so they have to be careful. She was just being cautious. She didn't know you, and however brief your conversations, guys have gone creepy on a lot less.", "Well, I like going to the gym just to focus on my exercises. Like going to the library to study. So I guess this is sort of your case. Ask Michelle if you can cancel your contract without penaltys because you feel that you might be seen as a threat. That you rather honor only to exercise and that you're not a stalker. Tell Michelle about your exact interactions with Jess. Show the message that proves you want to respect her boundaries. You can either change yout schedule or find another gym. Just don't talk with Jess. Because she was the one that warned Michelle already. So it seams she doesn't want to talk with you. And if you happen to see Jess in another place, just ignore her. Respect that she already said she doesn't want to date.", "NTA. Find a new gym. Problem solved.", "We stopped talking because I deleted the app. And the chat was very brief, ended not long after it started.\n\nWe both have an interest in the kinds of lifting for which there were only a few gyms. So everybody's choices are limited. Further, I only told her I was considering the gym--I gave no indication that I had signed up for any gym....and I wouldn't sign up for a gym 5 months later.  And I'd been considering it for months before (I had learned about it in November from an interviewer at the place where I now work).", "I don't have the messages because I deleted my profile pretty soon after, and this was months ago.\n\nHere is the thing. I have not communicated any interest that I want to date anyone at the gym, let alone her. There was nothing in that conversation, as long ago as it was, that indicated that we were even thinking about going on a date. Hell, I could be in a relationship right now but now an assumption may be floating about that I am interested in dating this person? Not at all! \n\nAs for changing my schedule. I would love to have the opportunity to work out alone, but given that I am new the owner is holding off on giving me 24hr access because I am still new (completely understandable). Now I am thinking about canceling my membership, but it's going to be difficult to find a comparable gym in my area.", ">So everybody's choices are limited.\n\nBut there are other choices. You chose to work out at her gym.\n\n>Further, I only told her I was considering the gym\n\nWas this while you were still talking on the app? You mentioned she told you specifically on the app she would not like you working out at the same gym as her if you dated. Then you randomly vanish off the face of the earth, and reappear at this same gym and start a membership.\n\nI'm not saying you did anything wrong, I'm just trying to help you understand why she might be weirded out by this. You said there are other gyms you could have picked, she mentioned during conversation she would not like you working out at her gym, you then vanish and reappear months later at her gym. It does seem weird.\n\nI also think that the end of your post where you try to turn this around and say YOU are the one who is uncomfortable is kind of silly. You knew she worked out here, and chose this gym anyways. I think you are responsible for creating this situation, and she is understandably a little weirded out by it. I don't think that you can turn this around on her and say that she is making YOU uncomfortable.\n\nI honestly think that this whole situation is a non-issue. It sounds like you guys already cleared the air. Just keep doing your own routine, and I don't think there should be a problem.", "Well, let Michelle aware of this. If you want to keep going there, try especific classes: judo, karate, pilates... to be more familiar to other members of your comunity. And after a while don't worry about Jess. 4 to 5 months of no chat is enough to ghost someone. NTA It seems you're making sure not to creep anyone there.", "She told me she worked out there, but I didn't sign up for the gym until 5 months later. At the time I sign up, I'm not going to remember some one-of, brief conversation I had with someone who I don't end up ever meeting.  Also, I told her I had been  considering the gym independent of her and as one among others. We stopped talking, and I forgot about her. Further, given that I had moved 3 months before signing up for the gym anyway, I was looking at other gyms based on what I am looking for in the gym and what's important to me. And I picked Swolly Mammoth because, based on my requirements, it fit my needs. It was not until I had already signed up and started working out that I saw her...and even then I was not sure.\n\nAlso when I said I am uncomfortable, my reasons for being so are valid even if hers are as well. It's not a zero-sum game or a competition here.\n\nLastly, how am I responsible for creating the situation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For readability's sake.\n\nEDIT 2: Also it's very weird that, even though Jess and I are both paying patrons, it's reasonable to say that I am the one encroaching into \"her\" gym. That is unreasonable to me, I mean she owns the gym about as much as I do.\n\nEDIT 3: When she said that she would not be comfortable with us working out at the same gym if we dated, I had responded to her and told her that I understand and agree to that boundary. I did not drop off without an answer.", "This, she's scared you're possibly stalking her OP - there are guys who do this and they all seem nice at first until they're trying to get you to a second location or following you home and threatening you\n\n she can't REALLY know that you're safe EVEN if you and others tell her because guys who do things like this often have friends who they've groomed to support them too. It sucks to be misunderstood but it sucks more to be scared so you need to show that you are just there to work out \n\nINFO : can you change your workout schedule so you're there when she's not there ? Might help her realise you're going to the gym for the gym & not to watch her.... \n\nDo this by stating to the manager options of days and times you plan to work out and she can be a go between to check if that's okay rather than asking her when she does in order to avoid her-this will show her that you're not interested and not fishing for information about when you can find her at the gym but are actually trying to avoid her", ">I don't remember some one-off conversation I had with someone who I had a very brief conversation with\n\nI don't know that I find this believable. You remember the conversation now, don't you? So why didn't you remember it before when you signed up, or later when you saw this person at the gym?\n\n>Lastly, how am I responsible for creating the situation?\n\nYou chose to sign up at a gym where someone you met on a dating app had a membership, and who had actively discouraged you from joining the same gym. I don't buy the \"I didn't remember at first, but now I do,\" argument you used above. I feel like you can't say you remember specific details of this conversation, but then say you barely remember her at all. You can't have it both ways. You remember her or you don't, and it sounds like you remember her and the conversation about the gym.\n\nSo you knew there might be someone at this gym you met on a dating app who expressed that they would not want you to work out at the same gym, and you still chose to sign up there. Now you're all surprised pikachu face that she's uncomfortable that you signed up there.\n\nAgain, I don't really think you're ***wrong.*** You can work out wherever you want to, but I think you're completely overlooking why she is weirded out by seeing you there. Women get stalked by people all the time. The fact that someone she talked to on a dating app showed up at her gym out of the blue is weird. Her concern is entirely valid.\n\nThe reason I don't feel like you being uncomfortable in this situation makes sense is because I feel like you had to know. Like I said above, you can't have it both ways. You can't remember specific details of the conversation you had, but then say you barely remember her at all. You knew when you signed up you were joining a gym where someone you had talked to on a dating app worked out.\n\nSure, you can say you feel uncomfortable, but I just don't think that sentiment carries weight here in light of the fact that you put yourself into this situation.\n\nI edited to add this, but I really don't think this whole thing is a big issue to begin with. You guys already cleared the air. Just do your own thing, and I really don't think it'll be an issue.", "I guess from her vantage, she thinks that I learned about Swolly Mammoth through her. Then I can see why she may think my signing up had to do with her. We didn't talk nearly enough for me to mention that I had learned about the gym prior. But also, since we talked so very briefly, I'm just as much a stranger as anyone else is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean, one thing that drew me to the gym was 24-hour access, which I would have access to after a period of time (the owner wants to make sure I'm legit, which I understand). Once I get such access I could work out more often at times where I am alone.", ">You remember the conversation now, don't you? So why didn't you remember it before when you signed up, or later when you saw this person at the gym?\n\nBecause something can trigger a memory that wasn't top of mind at a prior point in time. You cannot be serious about this one, truly.  \n\n\n>You chose to sign up at a gym where someone you met on a dating app had a membership, and who had actively discouraged you from joining the same gym. \n\nShe did not discourage me from joining this gym. All she said was if I sign up at this gym, we would have to stop dating. I could join the gym or I could pursue dating her--just not both.   \n\n\n>Now you're all surprised pikachu face that she's uncomfortable that you signed up there.\n\nYou're damn right I am. We barely talked, then we stopped. I haven't talked to this person in months. I did not remember this conversation when signing up; I had no reason to. I do not know this person. I did not even say I was planning to join the gym. We never dated nor even came close to approaching that.   \n\n\n>Like I said above, you can't have it both ways. You can't remember specific details of the conversation you had, but then say you barely remember her at all. \n\nI should have been more exact with my language. I do remember her, but I don't know her at all, and she doesn't know me either. And what I do remember is that\n\n* We did not talk about much in total, and as such we do not know anything about each other. We had not talked about going on a date or meeting up. \n*  When the gym was mentioned, she mentioned her boundary and I understood it. \n* I signed up for the gym 5 whole months after the very brief conversation.", ">Because something can trigger a memory that wasn't top of mind at a prior point in time. You cannot be serious about this one, truly.\n\nI still feel like you're using this as an excuse to absolve yourself of any sort of responsibility for how this other person feels. The reality is you met this person on a dating app, you discussed her gym, she mentioned she wouldn't like you working out there, you started working out there a few months later. It doesn't matter that you claim you didn't remember her but now you do, the major facts behind why she feels uncomfortable remain the same from her perspective.\n\n>You're damn right I am.

I did not even say I was planning to join the gym. **We never dated nor even came close to approaching that.**\n\nYou met through a dating app. I think it's disingenuous to say you never \"came close to approaching that.\" You met through a platform made for that exact purpose.\n\nI'm again, not trying to say you are wrong in any of this. I'm just trying to help you understand why she is uncomfortable because you seem confused that she would feel any type of way about this whole situation.   \n\nYou met this person on a dating app, you discussed her gym, she mentioned she wouldn't like you working out there, you started working out there a few months later.

Just do your own thing, and I really don't see how this could become an issue down the line."]}
