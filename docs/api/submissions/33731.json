AW is adopted, has 2 kids, a fianc\u00e9 (34m) and lives on her own. RAM also is independent, and lives with her boyfriend and his family.  They both lived with myself and their dad (57m) while we were still together, and things were always really good. I left their dad 2 years ago, and have struggled over the last 2 years with homelessness, so my son REM has had to live on his own. Recently, I was even in a homeless shelter for 5 months. He has struggles with addiction and was homeless as well. I tried to help him out by bringing him there with me and the 2 youngest, however he violated the rules by bringing alcohol into the shelter, so I kicked him out. \n\nI finally got an apartment 3 months ago. Nothing fancy, with housing assistance ( I\u2019m a full time student at the moment) and am getting back on my feet. REM was staying with AW for a bit, but she asked him to leave due to not pitching in around the house and not even picking up after himself. I allowed him to come under the conditions that he stayed of the drugs, payed $100 every 2 weeks, and helped out around the house. It has been 3 weeks, and I am overwhelmed. \n\nHe has only paid for the first 2 weeks ( has a good job at a grocery store) and has become very disrespectful. He bought an XBox and is constantly on the only tv in the house. He complains about only having the recliner to sleep in and wants to take his sister\u2019s bed, forcing her to have to sleep with me. He has yelled and screamed at me to the point that the maintenance man came and knocked on my door to make sure I was ok. \n\nThe worst came today, on Christmas. He woke me and GS up by yelling, refused to do the dishes, and has had an attitude. He got sideways with me to the point that AW while over with her family snapped on him about the way he has been treating me and GS and JS, and a big argument happened. \n\nI want to tell him he needs to leave, but I don\u2019t want him to think I don\u2019t care. I honestly don\u2019t know if he is staying clean either. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703573973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r2aho/aita_for_wanting_to_tell_my_adult_son_he_needs_to/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
