{"id": 17989, "submission_id": "13pqa7f", "title": "AITA for telling one of my good friends I wouldn\u2019t attend his wedding because my wife wasn\u2019t invited.", "selftext": "Main Issue: \n\nMy best friend from college (M26) and I (M25) are both having weddings this year, his June and mine November. Mine is really more of just a party because I married my wife at the courthouse about a year ago because we didn\u2019t want to wait until we could afford the party to commit to each other. \n\nHe invited me to his wedding but not my wife. I waited until his deadline for RSVPs and then told him I wouldn\u2019t attend because my wife and I go to events together or we don\u2019t go because she is the woman behind me as I am the man behind her and we are effectively a unit. I know I shouldn\u2019t have waited but I wanted to try and push off an uncomfortable conversation. \n\nHe blew up on me and accused me of always choosing others over him and not being a decent friend or caring about him at all. He said that he didn\u2019t invite my wife because there physically wasn\u2019t enough space at the venue and that I wasn\u2019t the only one affected by this. He went on to essentially say that I need to not be co-dependent and that he wasn\u2019t asking me to go on a six month deployment from my family but that I needed to be there for him to be a good friend. \n\nI eventually caved because he made me feel bad and said I\u2019d go without my wife, also after talking about it with my wife. But my thought now is that if you plan a wedding at a physically small space, it\u2019s okay to invite just me, but by the same token don\u2019t be upset when I decline because you made your bed type of deal.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting I had a similar constraint on my wedding but cut two family members to allow both he and his soon to be wife seats at my wedding. \n\n\nContext:\n\nI am a government controls engineer working on a very expensive (to the tune of higher ups giving updates to congress), very time consuming project currently. I\u2019m not at the top of the chain, but I\u2019ve been able to advance my career very quickly so I am in a position of responsibility. \n\nI missed his bachelor party because I needed to travel for a work meeting. \n\nHe is very much still the chad bro, let\u2019s get drunk type, and I\u2019m not anymore. I have a wife, I have two small children who are the absolute most important thing to me. \n\nI don\u2019t respond to his texts nearly as often or as quickly, and I don\u2019t endlessly play video games with our old group like I used to so I think it\u2019s fair for him to feel he\u2019s not as important, because while I love him, he also just isn\u2019t compared to my career but most of all family. \n\n\n\n\nAITA for saying I wouldn\u2019t go and now thinking I should take back my offer to go after having time to think about it?\n\n\n\nEdit: I know I\u2019m preachy, so I\u2019ll be brief. My wife and I are not attached at the hip. To clarify, weddings, funerals, graduations, work dinners we go to together. Formal events. If it\u2019s girls night or boys night level stuff we have no problem being apart. I also did not send in an RSVP. I let the automatic system do it for me. The website read \u201cRSVP here (no submission will be counted as \u2018will not attend\u2019 at deadline)\u201d. IMO that reflects very poorly on me, in an effort to be fair.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not going to his wedding and he\u2019s not going to mine. The friendship has been terminated, not for just this but an accumulation of reasons. People asked why I waited to respond knowing it was wrong. I was weak essentially and events from our history made me procrastinate because I knew in any event it wouldn\u2019t be a good conversation. Not an excuse and I know I messed up there. I think this was an ESH even with all the NTAs, and I was called on behaviors I have that aren\u2019t good, that I now recognize, and agree with.", "created_utc": 1684852378, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pqa7f/aita_for_telling_one_of_my_good_friends_i_wouldnt/", "score": 3108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see that lots of people have the same perception of partner (and kids often) or none of the family goes.

I hated the idea of not having a close person to me at our wedding in favour of the barely known spouse/children of someone I do really value. If you are likely to know others at the event I don\u2019t think you need to have your partner there. I\u2019ve often gone to colleagues or friends weddings as part of our wider group of friends/colleagues without any of our spouses because that is how we spend time together as normal.\nHaving said that, an invitation is just that and people should graciously accept/decline and the host should graciously accept that decision without a tantrum.", "Oh god.

You are handling this whole thing in the most passive aggressive way. If he\u2019s a friend you be up front immediately and decline so he can invite someone else. If he still wants you and wife says go then go and enjoy. It\u2019s a wedding, a time to celebrate others. Don\u2019t make it about yourself. Using family as an excuse to avoid a friend is sus.

If you'd sat down and talked calmly about weddings then you'd have been told the reason why much sooner.   \nYes is sucks your wife was not invited too but he is right, couples do not need to do everything together.  It didn't need to be a guilt trip by him, nor did you need to get angry with him. It was a simple answer, space. Your wife is not his friend by the sounds of it.

GFs and BFs you\u2019re not living with (and children) would be considered a plus one, but not a spouse.  Your \u201cfriend\u201d screwed up.

If you feel this friendship has run its course, it\u2019s okay to decline the invite without bringing up the plus one issue.  You simply say you\u2019re no longer available to attend due to an unavoidable conflict. If he demands to know the reason\u2014also bad manners\u2014your answer is \u201cI can\u2019t discuss it.\u201d Since you\u2019re essentially tossing the friendship, you don\u2019t really care if he gets upset, so don\u2019t get sucked in to unnecessary drama. Just stay calm and resolute and do not give away information.  Wish him the best and end the conversation.  \n\nYour revenge:  He\u2019s going to wonder if his omitting your wife was the issue, but he\u2019s never going to know for sure.  He\u2019ll twist in the wind\u2014unless you blab to other people.  I\u2019d keep my mouth shut and let him twist.\n\nIt would be bad form on your part to withdraw the invitation to your wedding.

Of the six of them, they\u2019re all now married, and five of them (my brother included) have kids/families.\n\nThe sixth couple is child free.\n\nNow mine you, *no one* has judged them for not having kids.

He has a family, he likes being with his family, his friends all like being with their families, and they all like the parties they throw now. All their kids are friends with each other, and the kids love the parties and events. It\u2019s not his fault that they just grew apart.

You have no damn clue how OP talked about this, and every single attempt to divine that is just pulling fiction out of your ass.", "Well we found his codependent wife lol", "If you can't spend a few hours to celebrate your friend without your partner I don't know what to Tell you...", "Wow, so much projection going on.\n\nI think it's pretty damn funny that you say waiting until the last minute is immature but then immediately turn around and try to justify a grown man having a tantrum because he doesn't get as much attention as he used to get.", "OP's critique was about \"He blew up on me and accused me of always choosing others over him and not being a decent friend or caring about him at all.\"\n\nStop taking OP criticism of his former friend as criticism of you.", "Wow. That's a special kind of crazy.", "It's not the same situation, OP is going to have a bigger wedding. Making this about \"respect\" is ridicolous.", "I\u2019m in a truly incredible loving and authentically unconfining partnership in which we can manage to do things without one another with ease lol\u2026how is not being able to go to your best friend from college\u2019s wedding because he can\u2019t afford the plus one \u201cunconfining\u201d in any way ?? That\u2019s the definition of confinement.", "YTA.  You don't get to dictate to other people what their weddings are like, despite how you've grown out of their \"chad, video gaming\" behaviors.  Waiting till the last day then fighting with him about it is low class.  If you don't want to go then stop making him into a problem just to explain yourself.  Plenty of people have small venues and don't include a +1.  All you had to do was say \"dude, I can't make it, here's a nice gift.\"  This was something that never had to be a problem  in the first place.", "Yta for the way you responded to your friend. You took it as an insult immediately instead of calling and asking him if there was a reason she wasn\u2019t invited. There simply wasn\u2019t space. If you had done that early on, you could\u2019ve talked with your wife and made a decision on going or not.\n\nYou responded rudely without getting the whole story. YTA. Apologize for how you handled the situation. It\u2019s your choice to go, but it\u2019s also your choice to do so politely.", "[removed]", "That\u2019s shit. I had a small wedding but for the few people that we wanted there who didn\u2019t know anyone else we of course gave them a plus one. We also tried really hard with the seating arrangements to make sure everyone was sat near people they would enjoy the company of. Some lovely new friendships formed and everyone had an amazing time.", "And this dude burned down an entire friendship for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like a small wedding, just family and close friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cSCREW YOU!!! You\u2019re not my friend anymore and you can\u2019t come to my wedding anymore!!\u201d", "It might be because of limited space? She might suck and they still wanted to invite their friend? Sure it's not proper etiquette but that's its own thing. \n\nIn the culture I grew up in it spouses were able to attend events on their own. I understand the commitment that marriage is, it's just the way they said it is weird for a 25 year old dude.", "But a wedding isn't like a night out with your friends. It's a formal function. Everyone you know will be busy doing wedding stuff, hosting, greeting all the guests etc. I wouldn't want to go to a wedding by mystery. The ceremonies usually suck, unless their short and sweet, and the receptions are only fun if you get to hang out with someone you know and do one of those stupid choreographed dances with them.", "Yeah we still hit him up but his wife doesn't like kids, dogs, hiking, camping, alcohol, concerts, going into the city, and much more.\n\nWe always invited both but because of that she was either a wet blanket complaining about stuff or refused to go so he didn't show. I still see him occasionally. Like dude you would say no to our trip to Boston anyways, why are you shocked we didn't ask?", "But he didn't respond, he waited until the RSVP expired then acted like a child when he was asked about it.", "No he didn't. He waited until the last second and didn't even tell his friend he had a problem, he just ghosted him and freaked out when the friend reached out to him.", "Sure I do. He laid a trap for his friend by not letting him know he had a problem - though it was big enough to miss his friend's wedding over, then told him how insulted he was after it was too late to fix. those are facts established by OP.", "Having an answer instead of a mark that said unanswered is nice, but that doesn't make it feel better that your wedding was so unimportant to someone you see as a friend that they'd rather just not respond.", "But he did respond, he just waited until the last minute.  The groom saw OP\u2019s negative response on the website, then reached out to berate him for it.", "NGL, for the longest time, I thought it was: Reserve (RSV) Place (P).", "No he didn't, he waited for the invitation to expire which sent a notification to the groom. He's a bad friend and the person throwing the wedding is better off without him tbh.", "Well, I missed that, somehow.  It is extremely rude to fail to respond to a formal invitation.", "It's not your fault. He's trying to hide it to spin the story his way"]}
