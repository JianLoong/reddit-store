Mine is really more of just a party because I married my wife at the courthouse about a year ago because we didn\u2019t want to wait until we could afford the party to commit to each other. \n\nHe invited me to his wedding but not my wife. I waited until his deadline for RSVPs and then told him I wouldn\u2019t attend because my wife and I go to events together or we don\u2019t go because she is the woman behind me as I am the man behind her and we are effectively a unit. I know I shouldn\u2019t have waited but I wanted to try and push off an uncomfortable conversation. \n\nHe blew up on me and accused me of always choosing others over him and not being a decent friend or caring about him at all. He said that he didn\u2019t invite my wife because there physically wasn\u2019t enough space at the venue and that I wasn\u2019t the only one affected by this. He went on to essentially say that I need to not be co-dependent and that he wasn\u2019t asking me to go on a six month deployment from my family but that I needed to be there for him to be a good friend. \n\nI eventually caved because he made me feel bad and said I\u2019d go without my wife, also after talking about it with my wife. But my thought now is that if you plan a wedding at a physically small space, it\u2019s okay to invite just me, but by the same token don\u2019t be upset when I decline because you made your bed type of deal.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting I had a similar constraint on my wedding but cut two family members to allow both he and his soon to be wife seats at my wedding. \n\n\nContext:\n\nI am a government controls engineer working on a very expensive (to the tune of higher ups giving updates to congress), very time consuming project currently. I\u2019m not at the top of the chain, but I\u2019ve been able to advance my career very quickly so I am in a position of responsibility. \n\nI missed his bachelor party because I needed to travel for a work meeting. \n\nHe is very much still the chad bro, let\u2019s get drunk type, and I\u2019m not anymore. I have a wife, I have two small children who are the absolute most important thing to me. \n\nI don\u2019t respond to his texts nearly as often or as quickly, and I don\u2019t endlessly play video games with our old group like I used to so I think it\u2019s fair for him to feel he\u2019s not as important, because while I love him, he also just isn\u2019t compared to my career but most of all family. \n\n\n\n\nAITA for saying I wouldn\u2019t go and now thinking I should take back my offer to go after having time to think about it?\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not going to his wedding and he\u2019s not going to mine. The friendship has been terminated, not for just this but an accumulation of reasons. People asked why I waited to respond knowing it was wrong. I was weak essentially and events from our history made me procrastinate because I knew in any event it wouldn\u2019t be a good conversation. Not an excuse and I know I messed up there.

If you'd sat down and talked calmly about weddings then you'd have been told the reason why much sooner.   \nYes is sucks your wife was not invited too but he is right, couples do not need to do everything together.  It didn't need to be a guilt trip by him, nor did you need to get angry with him. It was a simple answer, space. Your wife is not his friend by the sounds of it.

I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re married or not, living together or not etc. A wedding is an event where people want to attend as a couple, *always*. Invite *both* or invite *neither*, don\u2019t invite half a couple and then get upset when they don\u2019t want to come. Of course they don\u2019t want to come, no one wants to \u201ccelebrate love\u201d alone, not even those who actually *are* single, and certainly not those who *aren\u2019t*.", "NTA\n\nHe will learn soon enough \nDoes he not have a parent advising him?", "NTA.

You are at liberty to turn it down.  Also, how many stories have I seen on Reddit where a partner gets excluded, the invited partner gets told, \"you're not the only one affected by this,\" so they go along and turn up only to find out that, YES, they ARE the only one affected by it?

If you double down, it will be a huge strain on your friendship even if it's gone low contact atm.", "NTA.  And I feel bad for his wife if he thinks that friends are more important than spouses.", "**He blew up on me and accused me of always choosing others over him and not being a decent friend or caring about him at all.** Ok that was a pretty over the top reaction from him. Inviting someone to a wedding without inviting their wife is considered extremely bad manners.  NTA for refusing to attend", "NTA, do you have to travel for the wedding? Is the space restriction just at the ceremony? I ask because perhaps your wife could go along with you, skip the ceremony, but attend the reception?", "NTA really disappointed you stood with your buddy instead of your wife, typical of today's men though, you  guys always care more about pleasing your bros. He has a right to not invite your wife, as crappy as that is, but you have to right to not go. Stand up for your wife and yourself.", "NTA, unfortunately, sometimes we outgrow our friends.  It sounds like your priorities have changed, and he doesn't respect that. I know the friends I have kept are the ones who realize that and stuck by my side.

But Do you even like him?\n\nwhile priorities change, your life isn't his life and vise versa.\n\nI have a family also and honestly spending time separate is a healthy and smart thing to do with numerous studies to back up that claim.\n\nDid he go to your bachelor party? Because if he did, I can understand his side while he has been there for your milestones you have decided you are not going to be there for his.\n\nAlong with the comments made about him I say just lose each other's numbers cause you sound kind of  Protentious, and he sounds like he's at a different place in life.", "NTA, but dude \u201cmy wife and I go to events together or we don\u2019t go because she is the woman behind me as I am the man behind her and we are effectively a unit\u201d\u2026 your relationship sounds exhausting to read about.

Don't ask people to support your relationship when you do not support theirs. Not complicated. Ask Emily Post if you don't believe me.", "NTA. He doesn't have to invite your wife - but ironic that it's his wedding, which celebrates the union of 2 people... But YOUR wife better stay home because \"venue\".

Sad.", "You wouldn't be my friend after that, but it sounds like yall are already down different paths.", "I\u2019m gonna go mostly with ESH soft YTA just because of the judgement or character and saying no at the very last minute. You should\u2019ve asked earlier about your wife being able to attend. The whole \u201cwere a unit\u201d comment was unnecessary. On top of that, don\u2019t compare apples to oranges about who you allowed at your wedding vice versa. It\u2019s his wedding just because he did things a certain way doesn\u2019t mean he has too. I also understand wanting your wife there with you and I also understand like not involving your wife is an AH move but as far as the situation ESH with a soft YTA the whole calling him out drinking and stuff isn\u2019t your place it\u2019s his life not yours.

Or, hang out with family without your wife? \n\nSetting guest lists is really challenging once budgets and venue capacities are factored in.

You were right- he can invite who he\u2019s wants and you can therefore chose to decline, neither of these things make either of you wrong. Him making a big deal and attacking your character is definitely an AH move. But you attack his character right back, and make yourself seem uber mature and grown up compared to him, a \u201cchad bro\u201d, but you\u2019re not even mature enough to simply say you\u2019re not coming and explain yourself in an adult, timely manner? This could have been avoided very easily if you bothered to communicate, and realized that other people have different priorities then you, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. He didn\u2019t ask you to remove family members from your wedding for his wife, and it\u2019s clear he did not expect that from you. You\u2019re just in different places in life, but you need to stop acting like you\u2019re morally better and more grown up then him. You didn\u2019t communicate maturely, and think he\u2019s an AH for doing the same. Both of you need to look at the situation from the others perspective.\n\nNot related to if you\u2019re an AH in this situation, but you do seem like a bit of a dick. Your wife, children, and career are important to you, that\u2019s fantastic. This should be true for more people. But YOUR wife, children, and career probably aren\u2019t equally important to everyone in your life. And the way you describe your job and lifestyle choices make it clear you think you\u2019re better then everyone else in your life- spoiler alert, you\u2019re not. No wonder your friend thinks you don\u2019t care about him, you clearly think his choices are not as good as yours, and don\u2019t seem to respect him. Again, your NTA for not wanting to go to the wedding bc of your wife, but you\u2019re definitely not a great friend.", "This describes how I felt at every wedding before I got engaged.

If she was struggling to narrow down her Guestlist and she didn't invite my partner so she could invite someone she actually really knows and wants there I would not be remotely offended.
