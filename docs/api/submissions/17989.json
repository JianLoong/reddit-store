Mine is really more of just a party because I married my wife at the courthouse about a year ago because we didn\u2019t want to wait until we could afford the party to commit to each other. \n\nHe invited me to his wedding but not my wife. I waited until his deadline for RSVPs and then told him I wouldn\u2019t attend because my wife and I go to events together or we don\u2019t go because she is the woman behind me as I am the man behind her and we are effectively a unit. I know I shouldn\u2019t have waited but I wanted to try and push off an uncomfortable conversation. \n\nHe blew up on me and accused me of always choosing others over him and not being a decent friend or caring about him at all. He said that he didn\u2019t invite my wife because there physically wasn\u2019t enough space at the venue and that I wasn\u2019t the only one affected by this. He went on to essentially say that I need to not be co-dependent and that he wasn\u2019t asking me to go on a six month deployment from my family but that I needed to be there for him to be a good friend. \n\nI eventually caved because he made me feel bad and said I\u2019d go without my wife, also after talking about it with my wife. But my thought now is that if you plan a wedding at a physically small space, it\u2019s okay to invite just me, but by the same token don\u2019t be upset when I decline because you made your bed type of deal.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting I had a similar constraint on my wedding but cut two family members to allow both he and his soon to be wife seats at my wedding. \n\n\nContext:\n\nI am a government controls engineer working on a very expensive (to the tune of higher ups giving updates to congress), very time consuming project currently. I\u2019m not at the top of the chain, but I\u2019ve been able to advance my career very quickly so I am in a position of responsibility. \n\nI missed his bachelor party because I needed to travel for a work meeting. \n\nHe is very much still the chad bro, let\u2019s get drunk type, and I\u2019m not anymore. I have a wife, I have two small children who are the absolute most important thing to me. \n\nI don\u2019t respond to his texts nearly as often or as quickly, and I don\u2019t endlessly play video games with our old group like I used to so I think it\u2019s fair for him to feel he\u2019s not as important, because while I love him, he also just isn\u2019t compared to my career but most of all family. \n\n\n\n\nAITA for saying I wouldn\u2019t go and now thinking I should take back my offer to go after having time to think about it?\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not going to his wedding and he\u2019s not going to mine. The friendship has been terminated, not for just this but an accumulation of reasons. People asked why I waited to respond knowing it was wrong. I was weak essentially and events from our history made me procrastinate because I knew in any event it wouldn\u2019t be a good conversation. Not an excuse and I know I messed up there.

If you'd sat down and talked calmly about weddings then you'd have been told the reason why much sooner.   \nYes is sucks your wife was not invited too but he is right, couples do not need to do everything together.  It didn't need to be a guilt trip by him, nor did you need to get angry with him. It was a simple answer, space. Your wife is not his friend by the sounds of it.

If you feel this friendship has run its course, it\u2019s okay to decline the invite without bringing up the plus one issue.  You simply say you\u2019re no longer available to attend due to an unavoidable conflict. If he demands to know the reason\u2014also bad manners\u2014your answer is \u201cI can\u2019t discuss it.\u201d Since you\u2019re essentially tossing the friendship, you don\u2019t really care if he gets upset, so don\u2019t get sucked in to unnecessary drama. Just stay calm and resolute and do not give away information.  Wish him the best and end the conversation.  \n\nYour revenge:  He\u2019s going to wonder if his omitting your wife was the issue, but he\u2019s never going to know for sure.

Everyone on Reddit always says \u201cbut you are single, and you\u2019ll know your family!\u201d But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that sometimes I\u2019d like to being a date to an event instead of always having to be Great Aunt Carol\u2019s date and everyone\u2019s DD.", "Do you throw toddler tantrums when told no?\n If so, then you are immature as well, childfree or not.", "I don\u2019t know you, so going out on a limb here, but if you\u2019re 33, and people are still calling for you to grow up, and don\u2019t think you\u2019re an adult, it has nothing to do with being child free or that \u201cyou like to have fun\u201d, it\u2019s how you act and come across. 47, child free, still like to have fun, no one, since I moved passed teen years and has ever acted like I wasn\u2019t an adult because I never wanted kids. That\u2019s not the lack of maturity, it\u2019s something else in your behavior. Sorry.", "Guessing by the votes most people agree. We were definitely annoyed when people didn't RSVP, but to us it was just a \"fucking hell\" muttered under the breath followed by a phone call. Not really enough to consider them assholes.\n\nWonder if that's regional or something, because I think most people in my area would be similar.", "Yup. I\u2019m 41 and enjoy playing video games on my time off. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m immature. I also have thoughts about people who dump all their friends as soon as they get married, but that\u2019s a whole different conversation lol", "The friend threw a damn tantrum. That's what makes him immature. But sure, keep projecting your own issues onto OP, it's what this sub does best.", "Yeah, honestly. The right judgement here is ESH.", "Ignoring etiquette for practical reasons is one thing, being upset that someone opts out because of it is unequivocally an asshole move.", "We've talked a couple of times. He knows I won't stand for this, and he's talked to his dad.", "Not the user you asked, but when I was married to my ex, I was often excluded from family photos (\"Blood only!\"), even after my daughter was born.  Can you imagine being excluded from a family photo with your own daughter?!", "Do you think people are under the impression that the groom isn't physically an adult?", "That\u2019s another thing.  RSVP literally means/translates \u201cPLEASE RESPOND\u201d.  It does not mean accept, nor does it mean decline.  It means please give an answer, one way or the other, by the date we have indicated.  The groom (op\u2019s friend) is hopelessly immature.", "How dare you want to enjoy yourself at a wedding!", "Obviously that part is immature. But living a different lifestyle and not being a parent does not inherently make you immature.", "Oh, yeah, you\u2019re right. Thank you so much, I may never have known that without a stranger on the internet telling me.", "I don't abide by his tantrum, but OPs critique was about his friend as a person and the habits I mentioned, not his inability to handle this particular conflict well.\n\nI'm guessing that's partially because OP knows that would hypocritical since he was too immature to RSVP \"no\" before the last second and forced a conflict in the first place. Bit of a pot and kettle situation between them when it comes to accusations of immaturity from the sounds of it.\n\nETA: OP did clarify in the comments that his friend reached out to him asking for an RSVP because OP didn't actually RSVP, his friend had to ask for it which is a contributing factor to my judgement.", "Look at this guy, having blind faith in the postal service.", "You know what the R in RSVP stands for right", "No it is not. It is an invitation for follow up.", "I don't disagree with you particularly. It's ok to say no if you dont want to go. But op didn't do just that they left it ages and then made a big deal about how they wouldn't go without their partner. Just say no if your so co dependent you can't possibly go it have fun and get dressed up and have fun without your partner or just understand it's not about you and you can have fun without your partner. Either options fine honestly, but just communicate what you plan to do asap. Wether you go or jjt us your own issue. The bride or groom doesnt need a long winded explanation or guilt trip just because they don't I cute your partner.", "Refusing to go to your friend\u2019s wedding because they can\u2019t afford a large event is absolutely an asshole move, which is why I said YTA. \n\nNothing the friend said in response is unreasonable.", "He shouldn't stand for it either. Hope it gets better.", "No the original comment in this thread said that OP had grown up but the friend hadn\u2019t. That was the point they were making.", "The context of mental maturity feels pretty obvious there, is it not?", "Agreed", "I'm just a selfish, sober spinster. :(", "It\u2019s not immature to be child free, but people do grow apart because of stuff like this. And getting angry over it *is* immature.\n\nFor example, my brother. He had five close friends in high school through early adulthood. They were absolutely party Bros who had giant parties every weekend. Of the six of them, they\u2019re all now married, and five of them (my brother included) have kids/families.\n\nThe sixth couple is child free.\n\nNow mine you, *no one* has judged them for not having kids. No one pushes them to have kids. They\u2019re always invited to stuff they do together.\n\nBut they very frequently would get angry when their friend group would do parties and include all their similar aged kids. He started to be upset that they never did \u201cadult stuff\u201d anymore. They were mad that parties weren\u2019t the giant keggers they\u2019d used to throw, but instead they were pool parties and backyard cook outs and game nights and shit. I got a first hand look as I\u2019d begun coming to those events with my wife and kids.\n\nEventually the child free couple refused to see the other five and blamed them for \u201cabandoning them for their kids,\u201d as they put it.\n\nMy brother was sad he lost a friend, but I had to remind him he did nothing wrong. He has a family, he likes being with his family, his friends all like being with their families, and they all like the parties they throw now. All their kids are friends with each other, and the kids love the parties and events. It\u2019s not his fault that they just grew apart. Interests changed, lives evolved, that\u2019s normal.\n\nSo yeah, I guess my point is it\u2019s fine to be child free. I totally get it. But if you\u2019re child free and your friends have kids and a family, you can\u2019t be *mad* at them for making a different choice and wanting to be with their families. It sounds like OP\u2019s friend is angry OP settled down and it\u2019s not like \u201cthe old days\u201d anymore, and he\u2019s blaming OP.\n\nThat is what is so immature.", "I am pretty sure most people in here are not suggesting that a lack of children means he's not grown up. It's his actual behavior that indicates he's still quite immature and in college party mode as a person", "But not realizing that people's priorities change upon marriage and having children makes you immature. Especially not realizing job is more important than social", "Uh oh, there it is!", "Just saying, don\u2019t blame being child free on people thinking you are not an adult. People, especially women, deal with enough of that crap.", "Would that not be ESH then? Unless you think the way his ex friend acted was ok?", "I agree OP should\u2019ve just RSVP\u2019d no and been done with it.", "And apparently my soul sister, because so am I haha", "Well yeah that\u2019s freaking weird and immature. I have three best friends who all have kids and I\u2019m at every party, every event, everything. You dont have to grow apart just because kids are born. I\u2019m Aunt Itsathrowawayduhhhhh to all of them and adore them.", "Now you\u2019re not invited to my wedding!", "He did because I was involved with a similar situation.  Friend was paying his wedding himself with no help so they had to constrain the list of some people including partners. It was not like he was not acknowledging their relationship. He literally did not have the extra money to add them when asked and he wasn't being selective either. So yes, I understand the friend because it was not like he was intentionally trying to split them. Economics of wedding are very hard", "Every situation changes on countless variables, so with that logic the same can be said about not having to bring your partner, the way Op phrased everything gives a clear context and if that's wasted on you that's a you problem.\n\nLiking to do something, and allowing it to control your behavior and choices are two separate things. Lol.", "People literally allow all of their likes and dislikes to control their behavior and choices. That\u2019s how preferences work.", "Yeppers, and sometimes thoses behaviors and choices, or reasons are bad. \n\nExplaining why someone is codependent doesn't make it a good behavior. \n\nHope that clears things up."]}
