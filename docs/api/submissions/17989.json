But what about the other 99% of the time when they're with their new spouse and everyone else?", "Nta.  He's allowed to not invite your wife.  But you are also allowed to choose not to go without her.  Your friends needs to live with the consequences of his actions.", "NTA. Sounds like you grew up but he didn\u2019t. Skip the wedding, rescind his invite to yours. This \u201cfriendship\u201d has expired.", "NTA. Do the same to him, do not invite his wife and see his reaction... He clearly does not respect you.", "You can not invite a BF or GF if they are not that long together, don't live together..\n\nBut to not invite the wife of you married friend, the mother of their children.\n\nThat's strange... He's basically disrespecting your marriage, your wife, at his wedding...\n\nAlso, him inviting you doesn't mean he's summoning you (even though he seems to think it's set in stone). And by not inviting your WIFE to his wedding, he should have realized that there' s a big chance you wouldn't be coming.\n\nYou've obviously grown apart, don't share the same interests anymore etc. \n\nThat's normal as you've taken different directions.\n\nNTA", "NTA but this should have been discussed sooner. He should have been the one to preface it before invitations went and out say \u201care you comfortable coming along? Because of the space restrictions there no room for you and your wife\u201d and then you could have said at that point how you feel and tell him that you kicked out a family member so he could bring his fianc\u00e9.", "NTA for not choosing to attend, weddings are traditionally a couples event. It would have been much better to discuss it long before the RSVP date, telling your friend that it would feel weird to go without your wife to a couples-type event.", "NTA but you are right: He is a Chad. And, by his selfish nature, I can tell he will be divorced relatively quickly! I wouldn't go without my wife. It's not a matter of \"codependence\", but love and respect. You don't invite her? You damn sure ain't getting me! I'd rather be with her then go to anybody else's wedding! If he \\*was\\* your friend, a truly caring and empathetic friend, he would understand this. He don't.

But he's enough of a bigger AH that I'm sticking with the NTA.", "NTA. He doesn't really seem like a good friend. If there was really no room for your wife, he should be at least apologetic about it and explain the situation the moment you got invite only for one person. But he turned it on you. Especially by saying you're co-dependent just because you doesn't want to attend without your wife. It is normal to bring your wife to the wedding. He seems toxic. I wouldn't be surprised if you were the only one invited without +1.", "NTA. Some friendships are for life, some are for a season. Seems like you grew into very different people, time to let things go unless you both acknowledge that.\n\nThe codependent thing really grins my gears. And that alone makes your friend a huge ah!\n\nYes me and my partner can survive easily without each other. We just happen to like each other...sorry to the poor souls that can't wait to get rid of their partners for the weekend.\n\nThe fact he made that comment while talking about his wedding...yikes! Poor lady!", "NTA. Your friendships are allowed to evolve or fizzle. Since you and this person no longer see eye to eye it's okay to step away.", "Info:  How does your wife feel about you attending?\n\nYou're NTA for having different life goals, but waiting until the last minute was an AH move. If this person is truly your friend, you can take the day away from your wife for at least the wedding itself. You don't even have to stay for the reception, but to no be there for a(once) close friend's big day at all, simply because he didn't have enough space for everyone's +1, is incredibly rude.", "NTA  \nIf you don't want to go, then don't. While it's his choice on who he decides to invite, you also have a choice to not go because your wife wasn't invited. Interesting that you still made space for his fiance as well at your own wedding and he didn't take that same consideration.", "YTA.\n\nYou could have simply declined the invitation in a timely matter without the accompanying soliloquy. The whole \"we are a unit\" thing was unnecessary, but when you started throwing judgemental terms around criticizing his character, you became the asshole.\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to not attend if your wife wasn't invited. The rest just veers off into assholery.", "NTA. It's insanely rude and offensive to invite a guest and not allow them to bring their spouse. If you're so important you have to be there, you're important enough for them to make room for your wife.", "NTA it\u2019s reasonable not to go to events without your so. \n\nYour right they have the right to have a child free weeding, a no plus one rule wedding. But they need to realize some guest will decline the invite.", "I love how you described your marriage relationship. Together as a unit. He calls you co-dependent because you want to bring your wife to his wedding. Wife/wedding, kind of a hand in hand theme going on. NTA\n\nThen you caved. YTA\n\nDid you mean what you said about your wife and your marriage?\n\nMy answer would have been, dude, you're getting married, and you don't think having my wife with me is important? Of course I won't be there. And by the way, my marriage is and will always be better than yours, considering the importance you place on your wife. Nener nener nener!", "NTA. My buddy has a fiance that I absolutely hate. I invited my buddy but not her to the wedding. They didn't come and I knew they wouldn't. But I sincerely didn't want her there. We are still friends, no biggie.", "NTA\n\nIt is okay to need time to think, and think again, over a complex decision. I find it wild when people assume that everyone should be able to come up with perfect reasoned answers on the spot when pressured. That's why cooling-off periods exist in law (thank God). \n\nYou were clearly subject to a very emotional situation when you agreed to go, but now you've had some time to really consider, and you realize you made an incorrect decision. So as long as you acknowledge your reversal politely - 'sorry, I spoke in haste and under pressure, now I realize my answer was wrong and I can't', then your decision should be respected. \n\nAnd whilst I did snicker at the \"chad-bro\" description, it definitely got your point across.", "NTA- by the way you describe him, it sounds like he didn\u2019t want your wife there so you can drink and party with him like the old days. \n\nYou have grown up , become a father and don\u2019t game out and party like you used to and he probably blames your wife .\n\nI could be wrong, but if I were you, I would check amongst your friends and see if their wives were excluded too and then make your decision.", "NTA. OP, your friend obviously is very insecure and immature. When a man or woman gets married, they both should be invited to parties, weddings, or other types of social outings. Your friend apparently feels threatened by your wife. Honestly, I would decline his wedding invitation and terminate your friendship, as he isn't worth it.", "NTA until I read your description of your job.", "Well, as you said in the first place, you should have said you wouldn't go as soon as you got the invitation, but you already know that so I won't push that any further.\n\nI think the way he reacted to you saying you wouldn't go was way over the top, as you're right - you're saving him space at his wedding.\n\nI'm going to have to go with ESH. you should have said something sooner but he shouldn't have reacted like that either.", "YTA. Not for declining, but for waiting until the last minute and then declining with the whole \u201cwe both go of neither of us go\u201d lecture. You should have just declined or contacted him earlier to talk to him about it.", "ESH.\n\nYou declined. That was your prerogative. He argued. That makes him a mild AH. Then he attacked your character by calling you codependent. That makes him a big AH.\n\nThat said, you are an AH for waiting until the last minute to RSVP. You already knew you wouldn't go without your wife. You should have said that right up front. Perhaps, if other people declined to attend, he would have made room for your wife.", "INFO : Do the other guests invited to your friends wedding are allowed to have +1 ? If so, NTA.", "ESH. I can see that lots of people have the same perception of partner (and kids often) or none of the family goes. I don\u2019t really agree with this- often one person from a family is close to the person throwing the event and the spouse/children aren\u2019t a part of that relationship. I hated the idea of not having a close person to me at our wedding in favour of the barely known spouse/children of someone I do really value. If you are likely to know others at the event I don\u2019t think you need to have your partner there. I\u2019ve often gone to colleagues or friends weddings as part of our wider group of friends/colleagues without any of our spouses because that is how we spend time together as normal.\nHaving said that, an invitation is just that and people should graciously accept/decline and the host should graciously accept that decision without a tantrum.", "Oh god. Are you kidding? I can\u2019t believe this is so far an unpopular opinion. Big time YTA. You\u2019re not \u201ceffectively a unit\u201d you\u2019re two people who happen to be codependent assholes (at least you are, can\u2019t speak for your spouse).\n\nNothing in your context is relevant to the situation, it only furthers your assholery that you think it is.\n\nI\u2019ll edit to add that this isn\u2019t a \u201cyou can decline any invite that you want\u201d, because of course you can, this is a \u201cyou\u2019re an AH if you do\u201d.", "YTA. You are handling this whole thing in the most passive aggressive way. If he\u2019s a friend you be up front immediately and decline so he can invite someone else. If he still wants you and wife says go then go and enjoy. It\u2019s a wedding, a time to celebrate others. Don\u2019t make it about yourself. Using family as an excuse to avoid a friend is sus. Sounds like you don\u2019t really like this guy anymore.", "ESH- because you had time to ask him why well before the RSVP thing. If you'd sat down and talked calmly about weddings then you'd have been told the reason why much sooner.   \nYes is sucks your wife was not invited too but he is right, couples do not need to do everything together.  It didn't need to be a guilt trip by him, nor did you need to get angry with him. It was a simple answer, space. Your wife is not his friend by the sounds of it.  You CHOSE to not have two family members attend so his wife could, thats not on him to do the same.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
