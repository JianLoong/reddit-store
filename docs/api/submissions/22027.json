They are doing well overall and we basically have a 50/50 split with custody. It\u2019s wonderful to have \u201cdays off\u201d so much new free time when they are not home so I have been able to explore new hobbies\n\nSo I joined a models club, you build models and show them off, we met once a month to show off our creations, I love it.\n\nMy 17 year old messed up this week, volunteered for a bake sale didn\u2019t tell me and forgot to make cupcakes. I was about to leave for my meeting last night and he was panicking about not having it done. He asked me if I could do it and I told him no since I was leaving.  \n\nHe was also leaving to hang out with his friend. This morning cupcakes were not made since I wasn\u2019t doing it. We got in a huge fight about me not helping him out. I wasn\u2019t putting my life on hold for a simple mistake he did. He left for his fathers and my ex also got in an argument with me about it and called me a jerk\n\nThank you for all the feedback, I am trying to teach him what the lesson i missed when married.  Want more info on that it is in a comment. \n\nIf anyone has any ideas I\u2019m open for advice, I\u2019m running out of time before college and he is with the man he learn this behavior half the time.

The thing that damns your 17 year old is that he chose to hang out with his friend and just expected to dump it onto you.

He had time to do it, he just couldn't be bothered to do it, and at 17 years old, he should understand that Mummy will not always be there to cover for him when he makes promises and fails to meet them. He has to take responsibility for himself.", "NTA your son was irresponsible, you weren't. He is awfully entitled, too. \n\nBut beyond that, I think you're carrying a bit of trauma from your marriage and projecting it on your relationship with your kids.

He and his friend should have taken the time that evening to make them if he wanted to bring them the next day, but they didn't.

You wouldn't do it to save him from letting someone else down?", "NTA. One way or another, he needs to learn proper planning.", "NTA. He\u2019s 17, if he made a commitment then that\u2019s on him.

So, you leaving him to his own devices like that is acceptable.  I usually would say that you are the AH for this exact phrasing, but I'm going to say NTA because of the simple fact that your son KNEW that he needed to have cupcakes ready.  If he needed help, he should have said \"Mom (or Dad; sorry!), I have a thing where I need cupcakes ready by this date.  Do you think you could help me?\"  If he said that (or similar), I'd say you'd be the AH.  Since he didn't, he needs to take responsibility.", "NTA. Your oldest is 17. Need to learn consecuences.", "NTA he was going to hang out with friends should have been getting it done.", "NTA. if i had been in that situation, my mom would\u2019ve made me cancel my plans and make them myself. granted i started learning to bake when i was like 8 so it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal for me. heck he could\u2019ve even still gone to his friends and they could\u2019ve just hit up the grocery store together.", "NTA.\n\nMy parents are divorced and it was the best thing that happened in my family cause my mother started to have a life again. She became 10-20 years younger literally (figuratively). \n\nProud of you, really! Don\u2019t let that stu*** kid let you down, he\u2019s following his father\u2019s steps.

It's a good lesson learned and I wouldn't be debating this with your ex. Your house, your approach.", "NTA he went to hang with friends. He is 17 and I am going to assume physically and cognitively able to follow directions on the side of a cake mix. To sum up, he fucked around and found out.", "Seems like your almost adult son has picked up some shitty habits and mindset from the side of the family you divorced.\n\nYou have made your stand against your ex husband and its unfortunate that you will need to defend yourself against the same bullshit, this time from your own son.  \n\nYou did nothing wrong by staying your ground.

(Building models is also a hobby of mine).", "NTA, he chose to go out instead of taking care of his responsibilities first. This is a whole guess, but as you said you were a maid before divorcing maybe gave your kid the automatic thought of \"Oh, my mom is going to do it for me as she always takes care of stuff.\"", "When I read the title, I thought you were dedicating your life for the benefit of your kids. The cupcake situation would fit in with that. You took the opportunity to teach your 17 year old to take care of their own responsibilities.

Your 17-year-old son is plenty old enough to be responsible so this is on him and you taught him an important lesson.  In what universe is it okay for him to essentially volunteer you for this project and not pay you the courtesy of 1) asking if that's agreeable and 2) giving you reasonable notice.  His trying to blame you and then your ex-husband supporting him in that is not okay.  Ignore them because you are right.  If dad is so concerned, he could go buy some cupcakes to cover for his son.  The jerks here are first your ex-husband and then your son, in that order.", "NTA.  That's not being a jerk; that's being a good parent by letting your kid suffer the natural consequences of their bad decisions.  No one told him to go hang out with his friend.  He could and should have stayed home to bake his cupcakes. A 17 year old should be responsible enough to do the work they're signing up for.

If he really was worried about it he wouldn't have left to hang out with his friend, he should have stayed and fulfilled the task he promised to do.", "NTA. This reaction would be the same even if you had full custody. He's a year off from being an adult and signed up for something yet did not prepare for it AND while asking you to clean up for him he's off hanging out when he could've baked a few things, he needs to reap what he sows because it's all his fault", "NTA if the kid wasn\u2019t even willing to cancel his plans to meet his own commitments why should he expect you to do it for him. \nYou may need to have a heart to heart with your son who grew up seeing you be \u201cthe maid\u201d so he can understand that it\u2019s not normal or healthy behavior for a family member to take on all the work at home and never have an outside life.", "This has nothing to do with you living your own life or your divorce or any of that.  Your 17 year old asked you at the absolute last minute to bake cupcakes that they volunteered for a bake sale.  You weren't available to do that.  This is something that my 9 year old knows not to do.  You don't ask something like that at the last minute.

NTA judgement for you, valuable life lesson for him.", "NTA. As long as the supplies were on hand, a 17yo is perfectly capable of reading directions and baking cupcakes - for a commitment HE made. That he chose to blow off his responsibility in favor of frivolous fun, is HIS PROBLEM, not yours. Ultimately this is NO DIFFERENT than not doing their homework, and a good lesson on consequences. I'm guessing Ex still sees everything from a sexist ' it's a Mom's Job to do these things, blah blah blah...' point of view.", "Any 17 year old can search up how to make cupcakes and do it lol", "NTA he's 17. He can figure it out instead of going to his friends or get his friend to help. \n\nI did something similar in high school. Forgot I needed something until bedtime the night before. My mom got a recipe out of her box of random recipes, said we had everything I'd need and she went to bed.

Better to learn that lesson with silly cupcakes, than something more serious. \n\nYou do you mom!", "A 17 year old can\u2019t make some cupcakes?", "NTA in the slightest. Your son is almost a full grown adult and needs to act like it. If I neglected letting my mom know about a school project I needed items for until the night before it was due, guess what? That project was not getting completed. And that was when I was a much younger child! Your son will get a big wake up call once he starts working (if not already) or goes to college and supervisors or professors *gasp* have expectations that he needs to prepare for!", "NTA if you had time to make cupcakes then he did too lol?? He could have not gone to see his friend!! There's definitely (obviously) times when you've got to drop everything for your kids but this isn't it", "NTA. Your son is ridiculous for thinking you will drop everything to do something he promised himself to, while he is hanging out with friends. Also your ex is ridiculous bc I am sure he won't make a cupcake even without any plans.", "NTA. He's more than old enough to handle that himself. He could have stayed home and made the cupcakes himself.\n\nThe only way you could be the AH here is if you completely failed to raise your kids with any kind of basic life skills.", "NTA, 17 is old enough to be responsible for keeping their commitments.

He could just as easily stayed and make cupcakes instead of going to his friends...or went to the store and bought some.", "NTA.. a 17yo is old enough to be accountable for shit like that. and your ex should not be weighing in on it and calling you names regardless.", "NTA\n\nHe should have not have went out to hang with friends and dealt with HIS responsibilities.", "NTA. This is so mild compared to what I was expecting from the title. I expected to read someone is leaving young kids at home while they go out and party every night. Your son is nearly an adult. You\u2019re not missing his graduation or championship game. He can absolutely choose to stay home and bake the cupcakes. Your once monthly club sounds really wholesome, and I wouldn\u2019t bail on it last minute in this case either.", "NTA- what a great opportunity to teach him that he can\u2019t forget then go hang out with friends and expect someone else to do it. \n\nAlso, congrats on your divorce. The second part of your life has started. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy and pouring into yourself!", "NTA, 17 is too old to shield him from consequences.  He neglected a commitment he made, not you. This is a good opportunity for a life lesson. He might feel the sting from this, but no one's life will be ruined with one less plate of cupcakes.", "NTA, he is 17 and could totally make a rational decision when it comes to his priorities. If he was something like 14 I would have said maybe slightly T A  because most kids are just discovering independence and make mistakes with time, but this is fully his fault, he didn't need to meet his friend you needed to go to this meeting, he could have actually had the friend over and baked cookies together, if you trusted them alone I mean, and made a night of it.

I basically a maid for the family it was awful not to mention was working at the same time. \n\nOverall it been a bit rough for the kids with the youngest being 14 and the oldest being 17. They are doing well overall and we basically have a 50/50 split with custody. It\u2019s wonderful to have \u201cdays off\u201d so much new free time when they are not home so I have been able to explore new hobbies\n\nSo I joined a models club, you build models and show them off, we met once a month to show off our creations, I love it.\n\nMy 17 year old messed up this week, volunteered for a bake sale didn\u2019t tell me and forgot to make cupcakes. I was about to leave for my meeting last night and he was panicking about not having it done. He asked me if I could do it and I told him no since I was leaving.  \n\nHe was also leaving to hang out with his friend. This morning cupcakes were not made since I wasn\u2019t doing it. We got in a huge fight about me not helping him out. I wasn\u2019t putting my life on hold for a simple mistake he did. He left for his fathers and my ex also got in an argument with me about it and called me a jerk\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA  \n\n\n17 is absolutely old enough to make cupcakes on their own. It would be  bit different if they realised they were missing some ingredients and asked if you could go shopping last minute and maybe delay your evening plans. That's within reasonable teenage oopsies.   \n\n\nBut it sounded like they planned to go out with friend and get you to make cupcakes? Nope!", "NTA. At 17 he\u2019s old enough to face the consequences of his actions and prioritize his time with a looming deadline.", "NTA between you and ex. I wouldn't apply this to the 17 year old though, because they need to be taught to know better when they mess up like this without the label.", "NTA- the title is almost misleading imho. It\u2019s not like your prioritizing elements of your life above your kids, you\u2019re literally just letting your 17 year old suffer the consequences of his own actions. He\u2019s 17!!! He is more than capable of making cupcakes himself!", "NTA. He\u2019s old enough to follow directions on the back of a cake mix. Ridiculous that he has the nerve to try and rope you into blame. Very immature of him.", "NTA. Everyone\u2019s got to learn to stand on their own two feet. Especially when you\u2019re 17.", "NTA. What you described is not your title *at all*.\n\nYour near-adult offspring screwed up his scheduling, and instead of taking the hit and cancelling plans with his friends, he expected you to do it. That's fucked.", "NTA why are your plans less important than his or his other parents plans. He could have invited his friend around and they could make together or he could have gotten up earlier to make them.  Sounds like he agreed and actually committed you without telling you.  \n\nTell your Ex if they bring this up that it is great that they agreed to do it if this happens again.", "NTA. And don't argue or try to justify yourself with your kid or your ex. He created his own problem and had the ability to solve it. You had plans. Period. Lesson learned or it might take a few more times before he gets the hint.", "A 17 yo can make cupcakes", "NTA.", "NTA. At 17, he can make his own damn cupcakes.", "Nta for what you did that's good parenting and he needs to learn these lessons at 17yo\n\nKinda feel like yta for making it about \"living your life\"", "NTA. He could have made his own cupcakes, he\u2019s 17.", "He's 17. Why did he need help making cupcakes?\n\nNTA", "NTA, he's 17. At that age she should be learning to correct his own mistakes not relying on you.", "NTA, although you handled it poorly. It shouldn\u2019t be about you not stopping your life\u2014which isn\u2019t wrong. However there was a more important point here. Namely, that teaching your son responsibility. They made the commitment and fucked up. They have to own it.", "Your kid is 17. That's plenty old enough to go to the store, come back and make something he volunteered to make. NTA.", "NTA so why didn\u2019t your ex make the cupcakes if he thought it was so important?", "Almost an adult and can\u2019t commit to something that simple? He needs to learn actions have consequences. Why didn\u2019t he and his friend bake them together? NTA. Mom is not there to bail you out when you mess up.", "NTA your setting him up for the real world. Future relationships, work setting, even friendships, probably wouldn\u2019t consider this a good trait. He needs to learn accountability.", "NTA\n\n17 is old enough to put reminders on his phone and to make cupcakes himself. He had time where he could have asked you to take him to the store to get cake mix, liners, and frosting and made them himself with you home to check in with for info.", "NTA!\n\nHe volunteered and failed.  His commitment not yours.  He\u2019s way old enough to get this, tough love time", "NTA i honestly don\u2019t know in what way you would be the asshole it\u2019s not like he will drop out of school bc he doesn\u2019t have cupcakes", "NTA. You mean he volunteered YOU to make the cupcakes and then got upset when you didn\u2019t do it.  Good on you for not letting him get away with it.", "Nta. At 17 they're old enough to make their own", "NTA. Does he know you can buy pre-made cupcakes at the grocery bakery?", "NTA. If he was younger maybe, but 17 he is old enough to know that he should have said something, and then when he realized his mistakes tried to rectify it instead of going out.", "Nta. He isn't a little kid. He could easily made them. And in the worst case he could have bought some cupcakes and pretend he baked them. Not right, but  better then have nothing", "NTA. He\u2019s 17, time to start getting ready for the real world kiddo. He was more than capable of following a cupcake recipe also it what takes maybe 30 minutes/ 1 hour?", "Nta. The title sucks though. The argument is about him being responsible or facing consequences, not about stopping your life for your kids. At 17 he is old enough to bake some cupcakes. He has to learn about keeping commitments and consequences if he doesn\u2019t. Simple as that.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your son never got the memo\u2026shit has changed.", "NTA. It\u2019s very important for you but also for your kids to see you setting healthy boundaries and self-prioritisation. They will know it\u2019s ok to prioritise themselves at times in relationships because you\u2019re modelling that. Good for you.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe next time your son will not just assume you will do his work for him when he VOLUNTEERS HIMSELF to do the work.", "Your son looks like a real piece of work.\nNTA\nThat\u2019s good parenting, teaching him that actions has consequences, and that he is not a baby anymore", "NTA, and congratulations for getting a life back. Let's take a look at the excellent lessons you're teaching your kids now:\n\n1. Moms/wives/girlfriends aren't your maids and personal assistants\n2. Everyone deserves to have their time respected\n3. Commitments you make are yours to complete\n4. Treating others poorly gets you divorced\n\n17 and 14 are old enough to learn these lessons. Stick to your guns, and enjoy having a healthy life.", "NTA - He couldn't read the directions on the back of the cake mix?  He's 17 for crying out loud.", "NTA", "Nta AT ALL!!! This is a good lesson for your son, for life. He's ultimately responsible for himself. \n\nPlease tell me more about the models club. I need a new hobby", "INFO: He couldn't canceled his plans of hanging out with his friends to make cookies because....?", "NTA - If it was really that important to him, he would have stayed home to bake cupcakes instead of going out with his friends and expecting you to do it. Your son is 17 and is going to need to learn to start doing things for himself. That's how life works.", "NTA. Like others have said, this was actually a perfect time for him to realise he needed to not rely on you. Nothing bad would happen without you, he just decided he didn\u2019t want to do it. My mum had me and my sister doing our own laundry at 14 would often let us sort our own meals out. It needs to be done and it actually felt like I was way more mature than my friends. Even now I meet people who rely on their parents or partners for easy things like this and I can only imagine it\u2019s because they weren\u2019t given the impetus to do it in the first place.", "NTA - he should have made the cupcakes.\n\nIf it were something serious it would be different.", "NTA he could\u2019ve stayed home to make them. He\u2019s old enough to follow directions and use an oven. He even could\u2019ve asked your ex to help him.", "NTA and this is a great teaching moment for your kid. He's learning about prioritising, responsibility, taking initiative, and about the consequences his decisions may have. You should have a discussion with him about being expected to honour the commitments he makes and taking charge of his life. He might not like this, but learning is often uncomfortable. People aren't going to run around picking up his slack when he's older and he needs to be prepared for that. He is immature because he's a 17 yo and is still learning to see past his own nose which that's acceptable and expected for a growing teenager. It is a shame that your ex hasn't managed to grow past this point though.", "Imma say that since the kid is 17 this is on them, they should be more than capable of remembering the bake sale, and making the cupcakes on their own.", "NTA. He choose himself when he went out with friends, you chose yourself when you went to your club. He's 17, not 7, he can deal.", "NTA. He is 17 and old enough to manage his time. He also chose to go out with his friend instead of baking the cupcakes. If he was 7 sure you could help. Or if you had the spare time/enjoyed baking. But at 17 he is old enough to do this himself and should not be trying to pawn off responsibility on you.\n\nI think it is a good life lesson for him that there are consequences for a person's actions. When I was 17 I was working nearly full time and helping pay bills at home and managing my own schedule, there is no reason he cannot bake some cupcakes for something he volunteered to do.", "NTA.\n\nIf this was a 7 year old I might feel different. But for a 17 year old to have the nerve to not even try themselves, blame you, then their DAD blame you??? Why didn\u2019t one of them do it themselves if they\u2019re so concerned.\n\nYou\u2019re right, they are treating you like a servant and it\u2019s good you are setting up boundaries to prevent it.", "NTA, 17 and he can\u2019t look up a recipe to make cupcakes? He\u2019s almost an adult, why does he need mommy\u2019s help with cake sale?", "NTA- your title is a little much tho. You didn\u2019t refuse to live your life for your kids. I\u2019m sure you still devote so much of your life caring and providing for them. You simply let him suffer the consequences of his own actions. He could have cancelled his plans or bought store bought ones (maybe tacky, but better than nothing)\u2026. Heck, he could\u2019ve seen if any of his friends knew how to bake cupcakes and they all could\u2019ve done that while they were hanging out. But he didn\u2019t do any of that and now he has to deal with it.", "NTA", "NTA.  17 is old enough to be responsible, ask your parent if they can help (not demand), and if said parent can't help, they can make the cupcakes themselves.", "Your kid is 17, not 7, he definitely is at an age where he should be doing that stuff himself. Smh\n\nEDIT: I have a feeling the son has seen dad treat mom this way his entire life and that's why he's treating her like this too..", "NTA. Models of what?", "Covering for a 17-year old's non-life-threatening mistake would be a mistake. Sounds like hard love to me! Also good on you for reclaiming your life. So many parents have this \"mother bird\" philosophy of sacrificing every ounce of joy for their kids, but then resenting them for the rest of their lives.", "NTA\n\nAnd good you didn\u2019t swoop in and save the day. Kids won\u2019t learn to be accountable if we do everything for them", "NTAH, kid's gonna be 18 before he knows it, and then he's gonna be responsible for his own actions. Better he learns this lesson now.", "NTA- I have young kids (3 & 6) and I often do things for myself. Go out with friends, gym, focus on my career. Sometimes I feel like a bad Mom and that I am taking time away from them but at the same time I want my own life and not just a Wife and Mom.", "You son made a bunch of bad decisions, he expected you to drop your life and fix it. Your son is learning that action have consequences, the world isnt going to fix his mistakes so it\u2019s probably a good thing you didn\u2019t fix it\nEdited for speeding error", "NTA-\n\nI'm 17 and if that were me, it would be my responsibility to make those cupcakes....\n\nHe needs to grow up, he just has to grab cake mix and make them- OR HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SIGN UP-", "NTA: You weren't being asked to help him. He was dumping the task on you so he could go hang out, instead. He had time to do this but chose not to. Let me guess, at least one of your reasons for divorcing was because your ex did this to you?\n\nAnd this likely was not a mistake - he waited until the last minute, but then something better to do came up. So he made excuses.", "Looks like the next generation of weaponized incompetence is growing and thriving. Nothing about how the kid and the ex handled this is even remotely reasonable. Boy is clearly learning from his father how to treat women. In 5 years that kid's wife will be writing in with similar questions to OP's. \n\nAlso I'd be surprised if the version of this story the kid told his dad bears much resemblance to OP's version. \n\nNTA.", "HA I SEE WHY THE DIVORCE WAS NEEDED \ud83d\ude2d \n \nI do want you to make sure that you're children are not being raised to have misogynistic expectations of people.", "NTA. His lack of planning does not create an emergency for you. He could have baked some damn cupcakes, it takes less than an hour.", "They are 17 not 7. Why didn\u2019t they stop at home and make the cupcakes rather than going and meeting their friends? The cakes obviously weren\u2019t that important to them if they didn\u2019t cancel their plans. Why didn\u2019t the ex make the cakes if he feels so badly about it? \n\nGood for you. You taught your teen a valuable lesson, let\u2019s hope they learnt from it. \n\nNTA", "NTA, for this situation. \n\nBut part of me wonders how far you are taking this.  \n\nThe cupcake thing, that is on him.  I don't blame you, and its what my mom would have done when I was that age.  \n\nBut the way you are writing it, it seems like you don't really want to be a parent unless its on your schedule.  And that comes off kind of cold.", "NTA, he's almost an adult, he needs to learn responsibility", "NTA. 17 years old is absolutely old enough to make some cupcakes", "NTA - He made the commitment to donate cupcakes to the bake sale so he was responsible for following through. Apparently the cupcakes weren't that important if he chose to hang out rather than bake the cupcakes. He also had the opportunity to buy cupcakes rather than make them.   \n\n\nHe's old enough to resolve problems he creates.", "NTA.  It doesn't matter if you had something to do or not.  He's 17 years old.  He committed to something and it's his responsibility to follow through with it.  This is his consequence.", "NTA but the title is not helping you in this case.  \nIt would be better something like, \" AITA for not cancelling everything for my 17 year who volunteered himself for a bake sale but wouldnt bake\"?  \nYour current title sounds like a parent that wants to abandon their kids and is looking for sympathy.", "NTA enjoy yourself", "My answer would be different if this child was not 17. \n\nHe is a year away from adulthood and can\u2019t figure out how to make a pan of brownies or a tray of cookies on his own? \n\nAND he CHOSE to go over to a friends house to hang out, when he knew he needed to have a tray of something to bring later?\n\nHe could have told his friend \u201chey I\u2019ll come in like a half hour because first I gotta make brownies. Or, if you want, just come over here and hang out\u201d.\n\nHe could look up a recipe or use YouTube.

If he was 10 and forgot to tell you about his science project until the night before it was due, this would be a different story. However, this kid is 17, a junior or senior in high school. Teens do forget things, sure, but where he\u2019s wrong is expecting you to pick up his slack even after you said no. He needs to get his priorities straight, own his mistakes and realize that you won\u2019t always be there to bail him out.", "NTA - he is 17 and can make own cupcakes", "He is 17 and I assume he can read, follow simple instructions and is allowed to use the stove.\n\nIf he wanted the cupcakes he could have made them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. He's old enough to get himself out of small messes. He realized he needed to bake and decided to hang out with friends instead.

I was making cupcakes on my own at 14. Unless you refused to give him the small sum for ingredients I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. This was a teachable moment - he failed.", "NTA. The title is rather misleading. The 17-year-old made a commitment. He chose to go out and socialise even to the last possible minute instead of making good on his word. He's old enough to learn that when we say we would do something, and we don't, people will be upset.", "NTA best thing you ever did for your son was not covering his ass, yeah parents step in to help from time to time but he needs to learn when he messes up his parents can\u2019t save him. \nHis future partner will thank you to teach him to walk with his own feet and if he does maybe he\u2019ll plan better, problem solve and stuff.", "NTA - My mom always makes cake pops for events being held by family members.

Based on your ex-husband\u2019s response, I\u2019m going with your son at least seeing his dad do this to you.

No. You should have told me yesterday at the latest.\" \n\nSounds like in the past you've let them walk all over you, and they're having a hard time accepting that you refuse to play doormat anymore.

I fully believe teenagers need to start learning how to be more independent and more importantly how to manage mistakes. This whole situation is a teachable moment. As the parent your job is to teach your young adult how to adult, now's the time to help them learn to manage their time. That could look like keeping a family calendar of important dates, discussing things coming up once a week or whatever works for you guys. Avoiding missing deadlines is something we all have to learn. IF you'd known about the baking deadline what would you have done differently? Remind your child about the deadline and not all have been feeling stressed about the missed deadline? Now that the mistake has been made, how to overcome? Actions have consequences. And everyone is entitled to feel how they want about them. You're also entitled to not care what they think or say. Your actions/reactions are how your children (young or old) learn to do things for themselves. Even as an adult, I still look to how others handle themselves to learn new techniques or at a minimum do a self reflection on how I would handle various situations. Bottom line, you have important dates in your calendar that I would assume your children are aware of. It's important you set the example to have healthy boundaries about having and maintaining hobbies. But also teaching flexibility, your kid messed up and needed your help. You chose to do what made you happy and your kid rightfully feels upset you chose not to help them, regardless of their own mistake. In their mind you are parent and supposed to help/support them. That could have looked like giving them guidance on how to proceed, purchasing some treats on your way home with them reimbursing you, or them getting some. As was mentioned elsewhere, you could have explained that this wasn't as big a deal, tell them to make the mix and bake it. That would take maybe an hour for them to do and you minutes to explain as you head out the door, arriving maybe a bit late to your event. Your kid is probably more emotional about feeling \"abandoned\" in a time of need. A mistake that likely makes them feel embarrassed, stressed, and like a failure, and they unable to express that to you. Your ex is not even worth worrying about what they think. Unless you are all working together to help your children learn to manage their schedules and commitments, which you all dropped the ball on, no added commentary needs to be expressed or taken to heart. When all else fails, take a step back and try to remember what it was like to be a teenager. What a mixed bag or emotions. As a general rule of thumb, always try to respond to situations with empathy in mind. Mistakes happen. Have empathy and help when/where you can. I also try to think about how I would treat another adult in situations when I am frustrated with a kid. For someone reason we want to believe kids of all ages just have this ability to reasona and function like an adult when they have none of the experience to do so. Hell, most adults still can't adult successfully. I hope you and your kids can move past this. Talk to them about it, and listen to what they have to say without responding. Help them learn to adult man. It's a tough would out there, treating people tough doesn't make them tough, it makes them a shell of a person. Treating people with empathy will always make you feel better and usually makes the other person feel better. Win-win.", "100% NTA It\u2019s not you refusing to stop living your life that\u2019s all in your son choosing to hang out with friends instead of making the cupcakes he volunteered for.

If he's going to volunteer cupcakes, he needs to bake them himself. Not to mention, he didn't ask for help because he couldn't do it. He asked his mother to do it for him so he could go out with friends instead of staying home and taking care of his commitment. \n\nI think not baking the cupcakes was the right parenting decision. \n\nI just don't think that bringing up resentment toward her ex-husband and the life she had with him in a confrontation with the son is right, that's all.", "I mean she shouldn't talk about not liking her kids, sure. \nBut he is 17.

He could\u2019ve gone to the store, bought a box of cupcake mix and all the needed ingredients listed on the box. It\u2019s not that hard.

My own kiddos are 18,16 and 10. If they need something and wait until it is too late, they have to do it themselves. I will only go as far as to pick up the cake mix and eggs if we don't have them, but I will not be up late making cupcakes. The 10 year old will get a pass, but 18 and 16 surely do not.

Now, she\u2019s almost 50 and wonders what her life would\u2019ve been like if she had the opportunities I have or if she never met him/followed him/separated sooner. She has an awful lot of regrets. OP is in the same boat - she finally has something for herself (something my mom never had either, and has been slightly bitter about too. Not crazy bitter about it, but a \u201coh, if only\u201d). So, while I agree that OP isn\u2019t going to stop being a mother, she can put herself first *in situations like this*. The kid volunteered, didn\u2019t mention it to mom (who, likely would\u2019ve reminded him sooner as moms do), then asked OP to do it *so he could go hang out with friends*. I honestly don\u2019t even think \u201cI\u2019m not putting my life on hold\u201d was that harsh, though probably could\u2019ve been worded better.

All of this was his choice to volunteer then to try and dump it on his mom to do it for him so he could hang with friends.\n\nI do believe that OP has earned the right to be a bit selfish so long as it doesn\u2019t cause harm to her kids. If he got into an accident and she still wanted to go to her meetup, then sure, that\u2019s a problem. But, he gave up his responsibilities to hang with friends. Why does he get to have a life and she doesn\u2019t? She didn\u2019t sign up for the cupcake thing so why is it her problem? Because she\u2019s mom? No. I don\u2019t think so. His life, his problem, his responsibility. Also, she mentions she was a maid to everyone, which probably includes him. He\u2019s possibility done this before so this is her putting her foot down. I don\u2019t see a problem with that. Unless you want to coddle 17 year olds that grow up to be lazy people like OPs husband, and more than half the husbands I see on these confession/AITA threads that want \u201ctraditional\u201d households, then sure, by all means, make the cupcakes.

Son: You're not helping me out. Mother: I'm not putting my life on hold for a simple mistake you did. \n\nMaybe she didn't say it, which is good. But I still don't think it's remotely healthy to mix her marriage trauma with her relationship with her kids and her parenting as a single mother. Both the title and that phrase reflect that she thinks her kids somehow expect her to put her life on hold for them, and that she feels a need to take a stance that she won't. The kids aren't expecting such a thing. Her ex did. And forced her to do it by not doing anything himself. Her resentment is with him, not the kids.", "You don't need to say \"I won't put my life on hold\" to teach a 17 year old that you won't be waiting on him hand and foot. The phrase has nothing to do with the intended lesson. \n\nOP taught him she won't be doing stuff for him that he has to do himself. That's great parenting. \n\nBut telling him that line wasn't. It's dumping her trauma from being mistreated in her marriage onto the kid. He didn't do that to her, nor did he ask to be brought up in that environment. It is not his fault.", "I honestly don't know why you are being downvoted. This sub feels like it's filled with angry teenage girls.

You see what is wrong in the way your children were being raised and modified how you are with them. \n\nThere's still time, children continue to grow and change even after they turn 18, even after they move out of the parental home.

I know it requires great strength, but you have it. \n\nAll I said in my original comment is that your teenage son (or any of your children, really) aren't responsible for the crappy years you spent feeling like a maid. They did not ask to be brought up into your life and family, and they didn't set up nor decide how the home dynamic would be. Your ex husband and you did that. So I'd suggest you remember that when any of your kids is behaving in ways that remind you of those years, and don't bring up stuff that has nothing to do with them.

He\u2019ll have to start doing shit himself and hey, if all his clothes get ruined and he doesn\u2019t eat bc he won\u2019t pack a lunch then oh well, guess he better pick up his big boy pants and figure it out.", "What the 17yo did is a very common type of abuse that traditional sahmoms suffer all the time. My dad was exactly like that, he would promise to help with stuff or host family reunions, not tell a single soul in our home and then expect everything to be done when the deadline came up/ people arrived. He would also volunteer my brother to do all kind of stuff for other people without pay, just so he could look good. But it was actually never him doing stuff. He still shows this behavior through his language, he says \"I'm gonna do X meal for lunch\" but what that really means is that it's me who has to prepare whatever he says he wants. He expects me to read his mind too.\n\nIn todays society (or at least in many countries), younger men who behave like that end up alone. Women thankfully don't put up with that crap for long anymore. Breaking up/divorcing is a lot easier than it was back then and unless men isolate their family from society and the internet, there's always a chance they will realize that behavior is abusive. Of course it still happens, but at least there's all kind of information going around of how to identify red flags in a relationship (not just romantic relationships). \n\nMy mom passed away, my brother is a lot more independent now and I'm leaving the country for a long time. My dad has been getting into trouble a lot because there's no one to pick up after him anymore. He used to snap out at people a lot and my mom would apologize so he could save face.

I've seen people, men in particular, undergo a massive amount of change in how they treat the women in their lives well into adulthood. People are capable of learning regardless of age. It's a matter of wanting to learn, to change, of being willing to admit (even if just to themselves) that their behavior was wrong.   \n\n\nMy husband is a good example of this. He grew up in a religious cult. Very patriarchal with very little respect for women. He left it at 25. He turns 35 this year and he is not even close to the same person that he was 10 years ago. Hell, I'd say that within even a couple of years of leaving, he was a completely different man, especially when it came to his views of women and how he treated them.  \n\n\nSaying that it's too late to change, especially at 17 years old, is exactly the kind of excuse that people that don't WANT to change use. Stop making excuses for him. Whether he changes or not is on him but it has nothing to do with his age.", "17 is later than ideal, but definitely not too late!

But I think that if she sits down with him and explains her perspective/experience and helps him understand what it would feel like to be in her shoes (or the shoes of any woman), and explains why she didn\u2019t make the cupcakes for him and how he could have handled the situation as a responsible almost-adult, it can be effective.
