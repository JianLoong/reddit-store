If he needed help, he should have said \"Mom (or Dad; sorry!), I have a thing where I need cupcakes ready by this date.  Do you think you could help me?\"  If he said that (or similar), I'd say you'd be the AH.  Since he didn't, he needs to take responsibility.", "NTA. Your oldest is 17.

To sum up, he fucked around and found out.", "Seems like your almost adult son has picked up some shitty habits and mindset from the side of the family you divorced.\n\nYou have made your stand against your ex husband and its unfortunate that you will need to defend yourself against the same bullshit, this time from your own son.  \n\nYou did nothing wrong by staying your ground.

(Building models is also a hobby of mine).", "NTA, he chose to go out instead of taking care of his responsibilities first.

In what universe is it okay for him to essentially volunteer you for this project and not pay you the courtesy of 1) asking if that's agreeable and 2) giving you reasonable notice.  His trying to blame you and then your ex-husband supporting him in that is not okay.  Ignore them because you are right.  If dad is so concerned, he could go buy some cupcakes to cover for his son.

This reaction would be the same even if you had full custody.

Your 17 year old asked you at the absolute last minute to bake cupcakes that they volunteered for a bake sale.  You weren't available to do that.

That he chose to blow off his responsibility in favor of frivolous fun, is HIS PROBLEM, not yours. Ultimately this is NO DIFFERENT than not doing their homework, and a good lesson on consequences.

Your son is almost a full grown adult and needs to act like it. If I neglected letting my mom know about a school project I needed items for until the night before it was due, guess what? That project was not getting completed. And that was when I was a much younger child! Your son will get a big wake up call once he starts working (if not already) or goes to college and supervisors or professors *gasp* have expectations that he needs to prepare for!", "NTA if you had time to make cupcakes then he did too lol??

This is so mild compared to what I was expecting from the title. I expected to read someone is leaving young kids at home while they go out and party every night. Your son is nearly an adult.

If he was something like 14 I would have said maybe slightly T A  because most kids are just discovering independence and make mistakes with time, but this is fully his fault, he didn't need to meet his friend you needed to go to this meeting, he could have actually had the friend over and baked cookies together, if you trusted them alone I mean, and made a night of it.

I basically a maid for the family it was awful not to mention was working at the same time. \n\nOverall it been a bit rough for the kids with the youngest being 14 and the oldest being 17. They are doing well overall and we basically have a 50/50 split with custody. It\u2019s wonderful to have \u201cdays off\u201d so much new free time when they are not home so I have been able to explore new hobbies\n\nSo I joined a models club, you build models and show them off, we met once a month to show off our creations, I love it.\n\nMy 17 year old messed up this week, volunteered for a bake sale didn\u2019t tell me and forgot to make cupcakes. I was about to leave for my meeting last night and he was panicking about not having it done. He asked me if I could do it and I told him no since I was leaving.  \n\nHe was also leaving to hang out with his friend. This morning cupcakes were not made since I wasn\u2019t doing it. We got in a huge fight about me not helping him out. I wasn\u2019t putting my life on hold for a simple mistake he did. He left for his fathers and my ex also got in an argument with me about it and called me a jerk\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
