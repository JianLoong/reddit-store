Bizarre overreaction to the words of a child, also 100% he heard that from other family members. So being so mad at a child is bizarre, beyond that, he\u2019s 100% right about the age gap. This man could be your dad, with a few years to spare. His parents/family are the A for passing down homophobia, you\u2019re the A for taking out anger on a child, your fianc\u00e9 is the A for grooming you.

This kid may have been expressing regret, but not for what he said, just for getting in trouble for saying it.

That means you don\u2019t know if it was \u201cforced\u201d or not. I\u2019m glad a 12 year old is practicing how to be an adult. You on the other hand are practicing how to be a 12 year old, because you\u2019re way too old to humiliate and \u201csilent treatment\u201d a kid. Even IF the apology was a veil, you\u2019re still not handling it the way an adult should.", "YTA. He\u2019s 12.

The good thing is that he did apologize.  If an adult had said those things to you, I think my answer may be different.  \n\nThere is a saying,  \"fake it until you make it\"... even though you mention that your family \"at least pretended to be happy\"... that is still a step in the right direction and indicates their affection for you.\n\nCongrats on your engagement...", "ESH.

Next time you meet, be civil and open to him.", "YTA and congratulations \n\nHe is 12 and while it wasn\u2019t an appropriate response, you need to consider his age. At 12 you learn the majority of views from your parents. He hasn\u2019t had enough time in the world to explore different views or had much exposure to different views. While the adults knew to pretend to be happy/ force an apology. It sounds like they might have some homophobia. Alot of 12 year olds don\u2019t know how to lie about their thoughts or emotions. Honestly many adults haven\u2019t processed their homophobia or just pretend. You decided to take it out on the kid though. \n\nAs a parent of younger kids I would have taken my child away and explained all the reasons why that\u2019s wrong. Love is love. The majority of the shows and things they are presented with daily is similar aged couples of opposite genders. Without teaching them and guiding them how can they know anything else. Really working on understanding, acceptance and love rather than forcing an apology.", "NTA, you have a right to not accept an apology.", "YTA\n\nHe's 12. He's supposed to be dumb.", "ESH. \n\nChildren are a product of their environment. Who knows what their parents have been poisoning their mind with if they are brazen enough to shout that in the middle of lunch.

This could have been a learning opportunity.", "ESH. His comment was very wrong, disrespectful and inappropriate.  So was ignoring a kid, all day, because you didn't accept an apology.  What you should have done was ask questions of the kid as to why he felt that way, and addressed whatever was going on in his head, with patience and an eye to teaching him to be a better person. Because just ignoring him contributed nothing but punishment that doesn't help the root issue.", "YTA. They are just a child and get use to it, because it\u2019s unusual to marry someone that was your age when you were born.", "YTA. \n\nIt sounds like you were hoping for a more negative response from your family.  So seeing as the only negativity came from a child, you've dumped all your saved up outrage on him.  The homophobia is wrong, of course.  But he's not wrong that it's creepy you're marrying a guy twice your age.", "What the 12 year old said in public, people influencing him are saying in private. Learn to live with it. The fact he got the clue it was inappropriate and blurted out an apology says a lot for his manners. Accept the apology and move on. This is not the hill to die on. YTA", "NTA. Fuck that kid. Old enough to know better. I mean the not talking to them is maybe a tad excessive but good for you for defending yourself. No the 12 year olds homophobic remarks should not be forgiven simply because he said the word sorry.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A parent using a stern look to correct bad behavior in a child is normal and the apology was not \"forced.\"  It was a life lesson for the boy that what he said was not acceptable in that situation (truly not acceptable in any situation, but since I am guessing the family is homophobic, their intent would have been inappropriate in THAT situation) and he should apologize.
