{"id": 1268, "submission_id": "ym6i7h", "title": "AITA For Staying Out Late?", "selftext": "So last weekend my long distance (\\~4hr drive) GF (28) came to visit me M24, at my apartment for Halloween weekend.  I had two former college roommates and teammates in the area that Saturday night as well.  My GF and I went out Friday night and had a blast, but she didn't feel like going out Saturday night, the night we were planning on going out with college buddies.  She tells me to go out without her, and to be back in a couple hours.  Cool.  I go out with my friends, and text her while I'm at the bars with them, and then the texts stop.  I asked her if she fell asleep, to which I never got a reply, so I figure cool, she fell asleep, I can stay out later than agreed upon since she's asleep and won't know if I come home on time or not.  I had complete intention of coming home on time if she was awake, but since she was asleep I did not see a problem with it.\n\nMy buddies and I end up at the apartment of one of my buddies childhood friends and are hanging out having a good time.  It's now around 3:30am and I start seeing if anyone is ready to go, or if I need to get an uber and my GF calls me, livid that I am still out, saying how she expected me to come home, wake her up, hangout for a little bit, and then go to sleep.  She is still very upset about this, saying that I ditched her last weekend.  I realized I fucked up, but at the same time, I am not a mind reader.  How was I to know that she had plans in her head to hangout once I got back?  I got up before her the next morning to make sure that my getting home late didn't ruin our last day together before she went home.  So, AITA?\n\nTLDR: Long distance GF came to visit me, told me to go have fun with the boys and be back in a few hours.  She falls asleep while I'm out, so I figured I could stay out later, since I haven't seen the boys in a couple years.  She calls me when she wakes up around 3:30am, livid that I stayed out later than I told her, and now says I ditched her over the weekend.", "created_utc": 1667586594, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym6i7h/aita_for_staying_out_late/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Might make me the asshole that I stayed out longer than my GF and I had agreed upon, but i am conflicted because I didn't think it would be a big deal since she was asleep.  If she was asleep, she wouldn't know.  I wasn't doing anything sketchy either, I wasn't fucking around, I wasn't even near another female.  I was catching up with some my best friends from college whom I haven't seen since our graduation\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
