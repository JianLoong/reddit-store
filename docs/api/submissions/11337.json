My bottom line is that pregnancy SHOULD be a choice and you should be willing to deal with the attendant difficulties since you chose it, but our culture is so fucked up that you can't assume anything.

People are tired, people are hurting, people have challenges that may not be obvious.\n\nI have an invisible disability from an autoimmune disease. Standing is very painful, but I still don't ask for a seat because I think there's a sort of social contract on public transport that dictates FCFS for seating.

Or joints \ud83e\udd23 squeaky rib as we speak threatening to jump ship \ud83e\udd23 \n\nAn example is my parents hear the sickening cracks of my knee dislocating while I'm trying to make my bed... Then see me walking like an hour later and they just... Can't understand how I can be up and going after what they heard \ud83e\udd23\n\n\nThe first few times led to ER trips and wete painful as all hell.... Now like 20+ times and many years times later it pops back in and my day continues like normal.... I don't know if our pain tolerance gets higher or if it just...stops hurting so bad when it happens so often?", "\ud83e\udd93\ud83e\udd93\ud83e\udd93 here too!", "At this point there really should be someone nearby giving up their own seat to end the stand off!", "My Humpty Dumpty people \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "It's so easy to spot us.", "Would you say the same of someone who chose to drive a car, and got permanently disabled in a car accident? Driving is a choice, and it can be vey dangerous. \n\nHow about a sports injury? That's a choice, people choosing to take risks. \n\nThe number of people supporting the \"this is your choice, deal with it\" thing for something which is completely natural and actually is important for people to keep doing for the good of the whole society is crazy to me. We need people to have babies. And having babies does bloody terrifying things to women's bodies. \n\nStanding up for 15 minutes on a bus so that someone who is pregnant, unbalanced and at heightened risk of falling and damaging herself and her unborn baby is really not a big ask.", "I agree giving up your seat is a decent thing to do. I don't agree we *need* people to make babies. The planet is overcrowded. A lot of orphans need to be adopted. Most social and climate problems are a result of overpopulation aggravated by foolish systems of resource distribution.\n\nIt's OK to want your own kids but let's just not say pregnant women are doing the world a favour at their own expenses. People don't have kids to save humanity. People have kids to build their own families."]}
