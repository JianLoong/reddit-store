{"id": 4236, "submission_id": "zfuxbe", "title": "AITA for asking my wife to change her last name", "selftext": "So me (23m) and my wife (22f) eloped earlier this year. We did it with just ourselves and didn't really have any of our family involved other than me asking her father to marry her and her sister officiating it. We didn't fairly quickly after I proposed. And after taking a lot of heat and ridicule from my side of the family I firmly stood by my wife and they eventually welcomed her into the family after seeing how seriously I took my husband duties and that I choose my wife over everyone. I can't say that my wife did the same. She was scared to tell her dad we got married and thought he'd be disappointed  but like I told her when we told him he said congratulations and he was very happy for us. I felt a little hurt that I was more than ready to face whatever with my side of the family to have her as my wife, but she didn't. But when I broached the subject of finally getting her last name changed, she refused. She said she just knew her grandparents would be very upset and disappointed in her. And then she told me she asked her father if she should tell her grandparents and he said no. I was mainly upset with this because I felt she let someone outside of our marriage dictate what we do in our marriage and sided with them over her husband, whom she vowed to always be by his side. Now, after I said I didn't feel comfortable with her keeping her maiden name until she was out of college (her family paid for her college). She was my wife, and I wanted her to share my name. She told me it wasn't a big deal and she was gonna do it after some time had passed. But now I find myself filled with discontent after I see her maiden name or hearing her tell me how proud she is to be my wife. I just can't help but not believe her, and I feel she's hiding me. She says I need to respect her wishes, but really, they aren't her's they're her family's. While mine are being thrown aside. AITA? (Edit, so I guess I didn't give enough context. We are a very traditional and biblical couple. We keep God in the center of our marriage. And we keep to the biblical traditional such as asking the father for permission. She says she wants to, and she hates it when I call her by her last name. We had agreed to change hers to mine before we got married. We also agreed to tell her family aboout our marriage at a party before i left for deployment. After talking woth her father he told her not to and now she won't change it because she's scared for her family's feelings. I asked my wife about changing it just ONCE and after we talk and she told me she decided to wait THAT WAS THAT. I haven't talked to.her about it since because no matter what I stand by my wife and her decision to wait. The only reason I'm upset with her hiding our marriage from her family and going back on changing her name because of the opinion of her father over her husband.)", "created_utc": 1670494128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfuxbe/aita_for_asking_my_wife_to_change_her_last_name/", "score": 632, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And these days a couple would typically discuss this prior to marriage and either choose to keep their own names, choose her surname or his as the family name, or sometimes create a new one if neither wants their own surname used as a family name.

Overall, it's still considered the \"norm\" in most countries (as far as I know; I may be mistaken) for a wife to take her husband's last name.\n\nHOWEVER, you can ONLY ask. You can't make her change it, so if keeping her name is really important to her, she might decide to keep it even if you disagree with her decision, and ultimately that's her right.\n\nYou might suggest she hyphenate her last name. So if her first name is \"Jane\" and her surname is \"Smith\" and your surname is \"Jones,\" she could change it to \"Jane Smith-Jones.\"\n\nHyphenating surnames could be seen as a compromise, although some people might argue against it asking \"why is she the only one who changes her name?\" Well, the answer is she doesn't have to be, so theoretically you BOTH could hyphenate your names.\n\nI will say that hyphenating last names can be problematic for some older filing systems and databases. This is less of an issue than it was years ago, although problems can still crop up from time to time.\n\nAnother option is to come up with an entirely new last name for the both of you, although I'd generally advise against this decision as it often causes familial issues for everyone, but it CAN work for some people.\n\nSo if you're really interested in what a complete stranger has to say, I'd vote that you're NTA if you asked and didn't try to force, guilt trip, or otherwise coerce her; however, YTA if you did try any of those.", "INFO\nWho in her family paid for her education?

We did it with just ourselves and didn't really have any of our family involved other than me asking her father to marry her and her sister officiating it. We didn't fairly quickly after I proposed. And after taking a lot of heat and ridicule from my side of the family I firmly stood by my wife and they eventually welcomed her into the family after seeing how seriously I took my husband duties and that I choose my wife over everyone. I can't say that my wife did the same. She was scared to tel her dad we got married and thought he'd be disappointed  but like I told her when we told him he said congratulations and he was very happy for us. I felt a little hurt that I was more than ready to face whatever with my side of the family to have her as my wife, but she didn't. But when I broached the subject of finally getting her last name changed, she refused. She said she just knew her grandparents would be very upset and disappointed in her. And then she told me she asked her father if she should tell her grandparents and he said no. I was mainly upset with this because I felt she let someone outside of our marriage dictate what we do in our marriage and sided with them over her husband whom she vowed to always be by his side. Now after I said I didn't feel comfortable with her keeping her maiden name until she was out of college (her family paid for her college). She was my wife and I wanted her to share my name. She told me it wasn't a big deal and she was gonna do it after some time had passed. But now I find myself filled with discontent after I see her maiden name or hearing her tell me how proud she is to be my wife. I just can't help but not believe her and I feel she's hiding me. She says I need to respect her wishes but really they aren't her's they're her family's. While mine are being thrown aside. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
