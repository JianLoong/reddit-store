I have been with my wife (34f) for 8 years. We have twin boys (5m). We have had my older children religiously the whole time at weekends and during school holidays. As they have gotten older our house rules have differed from when they are at home with my ex. For example bed time is staggered by age at our house and things like no dessert if they don\u2019t eat enough of their tea. \nWith 4 children it is a busy household and a few rules help with controlling our time and ensuring we can do things as a family. \n\nAnyway over the last 12 months when my older children come over they have expressed their dislike for some of our rules mainly the no phones after lunch until after tea. (They can have them on them and reply to messages and calls however it\u2019s just no sitting on social media) they can go on phones in the morning and after tea if we aren\u2019t out doing things. During the day we try and do family activities such as bowling or cinema or bike rides and such or if we stay home it\u2019s board games and just interacting as a family. As my older son is getting older me and my wife understand his weekends he likes to be with his friends and we will drop him off to where his friends are and pick him up at a set time (as we live the other end of the city) \n\nHowever now for the last 3 months they have refused to come to our house due to these rules and my ex asked me to compromise on these rules which I declined, mainly because it\u2019s not the most aggressive and archaic of rules. (5-6 hours of no phones) plus it will start the spiral for my twins seeing that they can get what they want to if they express enough dislike. I have said the door will always be open for them and I won\u2019t be forcefully making them come to our house. \n\nSo AITA for not relaxing the rules so they come over just to sit on their phones\u2026 I don\u2019t think it is too harsh but I am also feeling guilty that they don\u2019t want to come over anymore.\n\nWith my ex they are allowed to cut their own routine and that\u2019s fine there as it isn\u2019t my house and whatever works for them. \n\nMy wife agrees with our rules which are for all children and backs me 100% but I find myself questioning if I\u2019m doing the right thing or not.\n\nEdit- the 5 year olds do not have phones and they all don\u2019t follow the same exact rules and the older children have their phones. They just can\u2019t sit scrolling for 5 hours in the middle of the day when we have made plans and made an effort to do something as a family. It\u2019s mainly one day a week too, the other day of the weekend, they are with their friends and have their phones with them and can do as they please with said phones.

Given your 5 year olds don't have phones, it's clear that these rules are aimed at your children with you ex wife specifically. It would therefore make sense to work with your ex to have more consistency across your two households.

You are going to lose your older kids because you aren\u2019t morphing your parenting style as appropriate with their ages.

Making a 10 and 13 year old have the same rules as 5 year old's is unreasonable.  Each child should have rules that are appropriate for their age group.  And, you and your wife need to start teaching your 5 year old's that they can't always get what they want, and that your old kids have different rules because they're older.  When your 5 year old's grow up, their rules will change too.  You're basically punishing your older kids in order to appease your 5 year olds so you don't have to actually parent them.", "YTA and your reasoning has completely backfired on you, yet you refuse to admit it.

It's working.", "Hey your kids are growing up so they\u2019re going to be more into their phones, but atleast you\u2019re spending time together. It\u2019s better than them hiding out in their rooms alone on the phone. IF you chose to lessen contact over this, Yta", "NTA for wanting rules, but why are you willing to sacrifice your relationship with your older children by not compromising? I can respect wanting family time, but your oldest child is at an age where they many not necessarily want all the family time you do. That's a very normal, developmental point. Would it be so terrible to allow them an hour or two of phone time after lunch before tea?", "I mean, would you want to spend your weekends following a new set of rules that you don\u2019t have to follow throughout the week? If you got to plan your own day Mon-Fri, do you think you would be happy spending every weekend following time based rules about when you can have your phone and what you can do? \n\nI know I wouldn\u2019t. Your kids are growing up and gaining independence, and you\u2019re kind of taking it away from them when they\u2019re at your place, **and** you\u2019re doing it during their weekends (which, I think everyone knows, are precious at any age. It\u2019s your weekly free time). If there\u2019s anything I know about pre-teens/teens it\u2019s that they value every single ounce of independence you give them, so taking it away is rarely a good idea and it should be done carefully. \n\nI know you said that they can still go out with their friends, but something tells me that it\u2019s easier for them to do so when they\u2019re at their moms house? I\u2019m saying this because my dad used to say the same exact things\u2014 \u201cyou can go hang out with your friends whenever\u201d, but it really wasn\u2019t that simple, and given the rules that you have and the fact that you live on the opposite side of town, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the same thing here. It might seem simple to you, but it\u2019s probably not for your kids. \n\nAlso, what happens if they just want to spend one weekend every now and then relaxing and doing nothing? Like no hanging out with friends or family time. Would this be acceptable under your rules? \n\nHonestly, speaking from personal experience as the kid in a similar situation, they probably feel suffocated at your house. I mean, they\u2019re refusing to come to your house at all, so at the very least they\u2019re clearly unhappy at your house. And it kinda seems like you really don\u2019t care that they feel that way. Like you\u2019re blaming the whole thing on them not wanting to follow some simple rules, but I don\u2019t get the sense that you\u2019re looking at how the rules (plus all of the things already working against you being their secondary home) fit into the bigger picture of their lives. \n\nAlso, you need to stop with the whole \u201cI can\u2019t let them set a bad example for the twins\u201d. The twins have a different life. They don\u2019t have to go back and forth between two homes and deal with 2 sets of rules. They\u2019re also 5, so you\u2019ll have plenty of time to explain this to them as they age. But what you\u2019re doing now is sacrificing your time with your older kids, and sacrificing their happiness, all because you want them to set a good example for your younger kids, and that\u2019s really not cool.\n\nSo yeah, YTA. Talk to your kids, find out what exactly is bothering them about the rules and why, and find a compromise. It doesn\u2019t have to be a total free for all at your house, but the rules you have in place are clearly not working and I doubt they\u2019re worth losing your relationship with your older kids for.", "YTA for the way you talk about them. Doesn\u2019t sound like you care if they come over or not. The \u201cfamily time\u201d seems to be oriented towards your new wife and kids. Did you even consider asking your older kids what they would like to do (activities, board games, etc.)? They may simply be bored with what you get to offer considering that you have to include 5 year olds in everything you do.", "But as children get older, there needs to be compromise.", "NAH\n\nI mean, you're not wrong for having your own values when it comes to raising children. Also, children are actually capable of understanding that different households have different rules.\n\nThe consequence of those rules though, is that your children don't want to spend time with you. I understand you have your \"family time\", but there nothing worse than mandatory fun, when you would rather do something else. You just can't socialize your older children to want to spend time with you, I think it's something you have to accept.", "> \u2026it will start the spiral for my twins seeing that they can get what they want if they express enough dislike  \n\nHow dare they express dislike of an arbitrary rule and avoid the authority who created it! \n\nYTA - rules maybe be nice to have, *for you*, but your decision here to enforce this one purely as an exercise of authority is why your kids don\u2019t want to spend time with you, and why should they?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Unless you are making them stare at a blank wall, I'm not sure I understand why it's an issue. They are there to spend time with you aren't they? Are you spending time with them? I think its okay to set boundaries and not want to sit with people not interacting together. If I only had my kids a limited amount of time, I'd probably make the same rule.", "I'm gonna say NAH. This isn't an issue of if you're TA or not, it's an issue of making things work with your kids.\n\nI agree kids spend way too much time on their phones and social media these days, but the way you're trying to get them off their phones isn't working. Maybe consider compromising and something like between lunch and tea they can scroll for an hour, but then they have to take a break for an hour before they can again? If you're taking them to do activities anyway, it would probably end up being a bit more than an hour without scrolling anyway, but to a kid it seems less daunting than \"5 whole hours without social media.\" They probably still won't like it, but it might not be so bad.\n\nI'd also suggest maybe trying to spend some time with your older kids without your younger ones every other weekend or something. They might be more open to activities that aren't as little kid friendly. I mean, hanging out with your dad is lame, but hanging out with your 5 year old siblings is even worse.", "NTA!! Life isn\u2019t a free-for-all and your house rules are your house rules.

Both sets of parents should be on the same page as to rules so those kids have consistency in their life. There's a compromise here OP. Why does it need to be a black or white issue?", "Maybe you can offer for your 13yo to earn afternoon phone time by first completing some work around the house.", "NTA. Rules are rules and it sounds like yours are just for human decency and to not be rude. It sounds like to me they have a no rule household at their other parents and they arnt used to not getting their way", "NTA. Your house, your rules.

Maybe also text them sometimes with \u201cmiss you!\u201d \u201cWish you were here!\u201d As someone who was raised in a similar set up, maybe try and have one outing a month or something, when it\u2019s just you and your older kids, just you 3. Goodluck!", "NTA, your motives are pure, however this is just a story. I only saw my dad every other weekend (if I was lucky) or on trips. One trip we went to a very tropical expensive location and I was maybe 14 and was playing very high level sports. I collapsed on vacation and slept for quite literally probably 10 hours a day during the first 4 days. Plus nights. My stepmom got all whatever saying I wasn\u2019t spending time and I wasn\u2019t appreciative and etc and my dad just said \u201chey it\u2019s her vacation too!\u201d We cannot control how others want to participate in our relationships.

I think calling you an asshole is too harsh however I would say you are being overbearing.", "NTA. \n\nYour house, your rules. And your ex should be supporting that. Maybe talk with her and tell her you don't get to spend that much time with the kids since they're only there on weekends, so you don't want half of your time with them to be with them staring at screens and not engaging with you or their siblings.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone whose parents split when I was 4, I spent my life going between two houses.  At my mom's I did whatever I wanted.  At Dad's, you had to eat at the table as a family at specific times, and couldn't watch TV other than the 11 o'clock news, or cartoons on Sunday morning.  If they were going out, you were going out.  I'm 42 now and when I go and visit them to this day, if they are going somewhere, I have to go with them.  It's their house, their rules.  In my own home, when they visit me, they follow my rules.  That's just the way it works.", "Yeah. I'm a little surprised by these answers. NTA. Maybe the compromise could be picking them up for a meal and spending a couple hours together? I don't think you're wrong and your kids are old enough to know that this rule isn't horrible. It's one afternoon without social media as you said they can answer texts. \n\nI guess some people are right, it could be called \"forced family time,\" but going bike riding, to the movies, etc doesn't feel terrible.", "NTA AT ALLL. People need to read the post again and maybe the comments. 5-6 Hours with NO social media for ONE DAY FOR FAMILY TIME? Come on, they can go without. I\u2019m also 23f so I grew up with no phones and then transitioning to a phone generation", "Sounds to me like your kids are getting old enough to figure out how to weaponize their time. \u201cGive me what I want, or I won\u2019t come over\u201d is all I\u2019m hearing.", "NTA\n\nThese are not unreasonable expectations. Perhaps your ex should consider adjusting to your rules instead of her asking you to adjust yours? Less reasonable, yes? So she shouldn't be pressuring you to change yours. I do think that that your ex should be insistent on them still visiting you as scheduled, and tell them to suck it up.", "Probably gonna get down voted but NTA. They can be without their phones for 5 hours 1 day a week. It will not kill them.", "NAH. I had restrictions on screen time, often 1 hr per day for tv or computer at their age and I\u2019m really glad. It meant that I read lots when I was younger, it was easy to focus on school work, I got outside more. So I really understand you wanting this rule. However, it\u2019s a really difficult situation for your older children to be in having different rules at different houses. And when I was 13, I\u2019d definitely have chosen to stay in the house with no rules. And if you continue to enforce it you run the risk of ruining your relationship with them. \n\nCan you try working with your ex to have some lighter rules that are consistent between both houses e.g. set parental controls on their phones that limit screen time at certain times? Maybe ease up on the rules if you\u2019re doing an activity chosen by your 5 year olds.", "NTA", "INFO: Unfamiliar with terminology, is tea another word for dinner/supper? Doesn\u2019t affect my rating, I\u2019m just trying to learn and the internet is giving weird answers.\n\nWith regards to this post, the likely rating will be NAH. You are allowed to enforce rules, they are allowed to remove themselves from them. However something you may need to realize is by trying to force family time with rules, you\u2019re likely having the opposite effect. It\u2019s no fun to hang out with people if you\u2019re forced to, and they may not want to. I play games and hang out with family cause I want to and they make me feel wanted there, not that it\u2019s a requirement. Something to think about, you aren\u2019t a bad person for wanting rules regarding screen time but this is one of those things where rules can have the opposite effect. \n\nAnother example, I used to love swimming in the pool, would do it frequently. However since I was splitting time with one parent and the other, I didn\u2019t use the pool when I wasn\u2019t there. So what happened is the water gets still and gross, and so my dad basically told me I HAD to go swimming. Soon I hated to swim because it became a chore, not a hobby or past time for me to enjoy. Then I got guilt tripped for not liking to swim, \u201cwe got the pool for you, why aren\u2019t you using it\u201d type stuff. Wasn\u2019t a good time. \n\nBasically what I\u2019m saying is if you want quality family time, you need to make a home where that quality time is wanted, not forced.", "Kinda halfway between YTA and NAH. I totally understand where you're coming from with your intentions. It was a good thought at first, but obviously, they are not having it. And as some others have asked, what's more important to you, your relationship with your children or them not being online? Forced time together really does not work. Take it from an adult who was that child that was online 24/7, my biggest nightmare was spending time with my parents growing up. Now, I love hanging out with them, and do it on a weekly basis even living 30 minutes away from them.\n\nMy recommendation to you is this.. maybe try a trial run. 3-6 months where you lift the rule. See how much time they actually spend on their phones when they are around you. You may find that when they have unlimited access that the appeal is gone. After that trial run, revisit the rule and talk all of you as a family if it worked, if it didn't work, what should change. Maybe even have a conversation before the trial run and say you're lifting the rule for a while, but you still don't want them glued to them for hours on end.

I can honestly tell you, again as a child of divorce, that when 2 parents aren\u2019t on the same page about something, the kid is probably going to default to what they do the majority of the time and/or whatever fits their personal preference. \n\nHave you and your ex considered family counseling?

Over time the weight of your judgements and demanding they modify their behaviors just to be around you during times when they should otherwise be able to let their guard down (we all really need weekends to unwind) is only going to snowball.\n\nIf you want to repair this relationship moving forward, maybe mentally put aside how you think they \"should be\" and appreciate who they are, and let them know that you\u2019re there for them.
