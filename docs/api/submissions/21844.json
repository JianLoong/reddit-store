You are totally right.  Expecting the \"healthy\" sibling to be a lifelong caregiver to the others, especially when you know in advance that future children have a high probability to be disabled is an absolutely abhorrent plan.", "NTA. She's being very unfair to all her children here. I have a friend with 3 kids. 2 are disabled (1 has Downs and the other has learning and mobility issues which will become more severe as he grows). The eldest (a girl) has no medical issues. \nNot once has my friend said she intends to have her eldest care for the other two. She doesn't have much money after her divorce but what she does have spare goes into a medical/ care fund for the two (who will definitely need it) and a small savings account for the eldest. As it stands, the eldest wants to be a nurse :-) \nI really feel for Stacey but she is wrong here.", "You\u2019re NTA and it\u2019s ironic that she\u2019s accusing you of being ableist (I have zero idea how she came to that conclusion?) when she\u2019s the one that doesn\u2019t seem to think that disabled kids need care beyond letting another literal child care for them. \n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s really messed up that she\u2019s planning on saddling her healthy kid with caring for the youngest. Her oldest daughter needs time, space and nourishment to grow and develop herself on her own timeline. Expecting her to assume the role of caretaker when she still needs care herself is total BS and is probably going to a lot of trauma.", "NTA. \n\nIs this how parentification starts? I forsee said daughter going NC when she hits 18, and she's not even a year old yet!", "NTA. And I would say that there are no assholes here because my impression is that Stacy is simply overwhelmed, very likely experiencing depression, and is genuinely scared for the future of her children --every parent has the \"what will be of them when I'm gone? What if I die a lot sooner than I imagine?\" moment, even when you have a neurotypical child with no underlying health conditions or special needs. \n\nThe reason why I still vote this way is because her (presumably) emotional state doesn't excuse Stacy from 1. Expecting to parentify her one \"non special needs\" child and normalizing it to a point of casually telling this to a co-worker.  And 2. Having more children knowing they could have special needs that she likely doesn't know how to provide appropriately in the long term. Nothing excuses her from the terrible choices she's making, parenting-wise, and for how those choices will impact her children. \n\nYou're not an asshole, you tried to advocate for her daughter, whose future looks dark and she's only 9 months old, and to make Stacy aware that she's going down the wrong path. It was a sensitive matter and bound to have a strong reaction, but you didn't say anything hurtful. \n\nI don't even think your boss is necessarily an asshole, either. I mean, upon reading I assumed they were including both her kids in the statement \"I hope you have another healthy baby\". As in, another child that lives and thrives with the appropriate care. If the boss actually meant to single out her youngest daughter and make a snide remark about her son, then yes, they're an asshole.", "NTA. You\u2019re absolutely right in what you said.

Care homes are rife with abuse and it's terrifying and heart breaking to think about how vulnerable they will be.\n\nMy eldest son is healthy, we've always made him understand that he has an obligation to love and care for his brother.

It\u2019s not ableist to expect parents to be responsible for their own children and it\u2019s wrong for them to put the responsibility on their healthy child and make them go without so much to help them take care of their child. Of course you want siblings to help out but in situations like this siblings end up be care givers like adults and don\u2019t have a real childhood and that\u2019s wrong.

I gave up my childhood, my teen years and my young adulthood being his parent when Mom wouldn\u2019t step up. People in our neighborhood actually thought I WAS his parent because they never saw him with Mom. I finally went no contact with her and him for ten years until her passing. Those were my most mentally healthy years of my life. When I realized that Mom died without a plan for him I spiraled down again. He had become a hoarder, didn\u2019t bathe or even wipe himself. He didn\u2019t clean his cat\u2019s litter box, he would fall asleep on the couch and pee on it instead of waking up to go use the bathroom. He needed to be in a group care home of some kind. But then my family got involved and told me I was \u201ctaking his freedom away\u201d and \u201cthis isn\u2019t what your Mother wanted.\u201d I tried for almost four years to work with him and alter his behavior and get him services to no avail. I finally went to probate court and got him an appointed conservator. Now if the family wants to guilt someone they get to harass the lawyer\u2019s office that took over his care.  And guess what? Their social worker determined he needed to be in a group care home. He now has a nurse and an aide to help him every day. I went no contact again because of how verbally abusive he had learned to be from Mom. My life immediately improved again with the no contact. \n\nIf her plan is to pass the parenting over to her child - she likely will NEVER see her child again once they\u2019re an adult and can get away.
