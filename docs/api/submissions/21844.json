{"id": 21844, "submission_id": "14vujrz", "title": "AITA for telling my co-worker she shouldn't have had children because of her attitude?", "selftext": "Up until recently I (19F) worked in a kitchen in a small restaurant with this one co-worker \"Stacy\" (23F) and maybe 5 others. We were a small team and we all worked pretty well together, but because Stacy has a young son (2) with down syndrome and a heart condition and a 9 month-old daughter she never attends any of our social gatherings after work, which means not many of us know a great deal about her except what she chooses to share with us whenever we're not busy.\n\nAs a result, it was a big surprise to us all when she told us she had applied for maternity leave again as she is pregnant and will be having her third child next year. Regardless, everyone was pretty excited for her and we all congratulated her and my boss told her he hoped she would have another healthy baby. \n\nHere's when the AITA part comes in. She got very snappy with him and told him it didn't matter, and that she wasn't going to let her family's history of health conditions affect whether she's going to have another baby, which is totally fine, so when she was back on the line with me I tried to sympathize with her and said that he shouldn't have asked that. We chatted about it for a bit until she mentioned that it doesn't matter that most of her kids will probably be disabled anyway since her daughter is healthy and can love and look after them \"As soon as she's old enough.\"\n\nI must've given her a funny look because she said \"What?\" when she saw my face, and I told her (delicately) it wasn't really fair to expect her daughter to be a caregiver, and that if she was going to have more children with a high risk of disability she should have something else in place. She told me I was being ableist which, admittedly, annoyed me more than it should've and I told her with an attitude like her's she shouldn't have had kids in the first place. I said that her daughter wouldn't live a good life if she constantly had to provide care for her siblings, and Stacy started crying and told me she was just doing what she could to have the family she wanted. \n\nI apologized for the remark but stand by my point, and now our other co-workers aren't speaking to me.

You are totally right.  Expecting the \"healthy\" sibling to be a lifelong caregiver to the others, especially when you know in advance that future children have a high probability to be disabled is an absolutely abhorrent plan.", "NTA. She's being very unfair to all her children here. I have a friend with 3 kids. 2 are disabled (1 has Downs and the other has learning and mobility issues which will become more severe as he grows). The eldest (a girl) has no medical issues. \nNot once has my friend said she intends to have her eldest care for the other two. She doesn't have much money after her divorce but what she does have spare goes into a medical/ care fund for the two (who will definitely need it) and a small savings account for the eldest. As it stands, the eldest wants to be a nurse :-) \nI really feel for Stacey but she is wrong here.", "You\u2019re NTA and it\u2019s ironic that she\u2019s accusing you of being ableist (I have zero idea how she came to that conclusion?) when she\u2019s the one that doesn\u2019t seem to think that disabled kids need care beyond letting another literal child care for them. \n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s really messed up that she\u2019s planning on saddling her healthy kid with caring for the youngest. Her oldest daughter needs time, space and nourishment to grow and develop herself on her own timeline. Expecting her to assume the role of caretaker when she still needs care herself is total BS and is probably going to a lot of trauma.", "NTA. \n\nIs this how parentification starts? I forsee said daughter going NC when she hits 18, and she's not even a year old yet!", "NTA. And I would say that there are no assholes here because my impression is that Stacy is simply overwhelmed, very likely experiencing depression, and is genuinely scared for the future of her children --every parent has the \"what will be of them when I'm gone? What if I die a lot sooner than I imagine?\" moment, even when you have a neurotypical child with no underlying health conditions or special needs. \n\nThe reason why I still vote this way is because her (presumably) emotional state doesn't excuse Stacy from 1. Expecting to parentify her one \"non special needs\" child and normalizing it to a point of casually telling this to a co-worker.  And 2. Having more children knowing they could have special needs that she likely doesn't know how to provide appropriately in the long term. Nothing excuses her from the terrible choices she's making, parenting-wise, and for how those choices will impact her children. \n\nYou're not an asshole, you tried to advocate for her daughter, whose future looks dark and she's only 9 months old, and to make Stacy aware that she's going down the wrong path. It was a sensitive matter and bound to have a strong reaction, but you didn't say anything hurtful. \n\nI don't even think your boss is necessarily an asshole, either. I mean, upon reading I assumed they were including both her kids in the statement \"I hope you have another healthy baby\". As in, another child that lives and thrives with the appropriate care. If the boss actually meant to single out her youngest daughter and make a snide remark about her son, then yes, they're an asshole.", "NTA. You\u2019re absolutely right in what you said. Stacey is only thinking about what she wants right now rather than what\u2019s best for her children! It\u2019s definitely not fair to intend on parentifying one of her children to care for the others, whether they\u2019re healthy or disabled!", "NTA parentification is a form of abuse. I\u2019d be tempted to tell her that you\u2019re not interested in the opinion of child abusers.\n\nImagine looking at a 9-month-old baby and thinking, \u201clol yay, free labor.\u201d", "NTA Good for you for speaking up!", "NTA  \n\n\nif she wants to have someone else raise her children she should put them up for adoption, not make one of her kids do all the work", "While you\u2019re not wrong it\u2019s not your place to comment that. I think some people don\u2019t realize that being right doesn\u2019t absolve then of being a bit of a tit. It\u2019s not like you saying that would even impact someone like that\u2019s choices so you just said it to be superior which has no effect outside of being sanctimonious despite being \u201cright\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My fianc\u00e9 is in this position with his brother. His mom didn't expect my fianc\u00e9 to care for his brother, though. She just never made any plans for what would happen to him after her death. She then decided it was a great idea to smoke excessively, not take care of her health, not receive medical care for her kidneys, etc. I realize caregivers often don't care for themselves, but it's extremely important to have a plan in place after you're gone. Even a will would have been nice. It's EXTREMELY difficult to care for someone who's disabled.

I remember there was a post on here a long time ago about a couple who both carried a gene that would result in their biological children being blind.  Not that they would be born completely blind but they would slowly lose their sight over years and be completely blind by age 13.
