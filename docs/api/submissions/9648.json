So basically, I, 55F have 4 children, William 25M, Alexa 16F and Gabriel 14M. My daughter has autism which means she can get a bit moody seometimes. For example, she broke my son's laptop when he did not share the laptop he got for Christmas. My adult son is a stem major and is pretty wealthy so he helped with the costs last Christmas. But, this year, my daughter has been getting teased about her autism and wasn't in the mood for a big celebration so we only had my son visiting. I did not want the same events with Gabriel's laptop to repeat this year so I called Wiliam to not buy any presents. I only bought my daughter presents because she would get upset if she is not the only one with presents. And when it was time for gifts on Christmas, Gabriel started crying for no reason and William left the house. But the day after Christmas, he came into the house with a lot of gifts for Gabriel. I berated him for not taking his sister in consideration. Then he called me a bad mother while his sister was crying and screaming the whole time.\n\nAITA for not wanting my daughter cry and berating my son for being so rude and inconsiderate?\n\nEDIT: Sorry guys. And thank you all for showing me the errors of my ways. It came to me that my daughter would not be able to be independent. I am the asshole. I should have treated my daughter as a human being who could be treated the same as neuro divergent people. For the confusion, my other daughter who is 28 cut contact with me after college, I always wondered why but I guess it is because she did not feel loved enough.
