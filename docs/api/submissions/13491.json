The kids had their own large table, right beside my table coincidentally, and the parents had their own table a few feet away. \n\nThe kids were running around like this place was a jungle gym, running in and out of the bathrooms every 2 mins, screaming so loud my family and I had to yell at each other to communicate, spilling their drinks on the floor. I felt so bad for their server. Even my families server was like to us \"gosh I can't wait to get home and down a glass of wine\" because the kids were just terrible. \n\nAnd what were the parents doing during all this? Absolutely **NOTHING**. They were all just sat at their table drinking their beers talking to each other, as if they're kids are the best behaved kids in the world. \n\nEvery few minutes one of the parents of the kids would walk over to our table and be like \"i'm so sorry for them guys\", go over to the kids table and be like \"guys sit down\" and then go back to the parent table. \n\nAs if simply telling the kids to \"sit down\" is going to work? Like maybe do your job as a parent and control your damn kids. Other people are trying to eat and enjoy their dinners at this restaurant, not deal with this.\n\nLike if you knew your kids were going to act like this why not host something at one of their houses? Instead of making a whole restaurant suffer.\n\nOne of the parents from the table came over to my families table for the 4th time to apologize, and right before she was about to speak I looked her dead in the eye and said \"maybe instead of apologizing you could not be a shitty parent, get off your asses and actually control your kids? We're trying to enjoy our dinner here\".\n\nShe looked shocked and said \"you don't have to be rude about it\" and walked away. The rest of the dinner the parents were giving me and my family dirty looks, but still just sitting there not doing anything about the kids. \n\nWe gave my server a large tip and left.\n\nI feel bad for saying what I said, but I don't understand how you can just let your kids do that and think they're not bothering anybody. AITA?\n\nINFO: We could not move tables because all the tables at the front of the restaurant, away from the kids were taken.

ETA: Kids will be kids but expecting restaurant behavior from an 8 - 10 year old is not unreasonable. If these kids aren't capable, have a pizza party in a park where running around is expected and accepted.\n\nNTA. I'm glad you yelled at them. Until people like this are publically shamed, they'll continue because \"well no one complained!\"", "NTA\n\nYou underacted. And IMO, the restaurant underacted aswell.", "NTA. \"Sorry for the kids, but I won't do anything about them\" is the lamest attitude. Those parents knew exactly what they were doing when they arranged a specific kids table and a specific adults table. They probably expected to be set apart from other diners, so kept coming over to apologise to ease their consciences, instead of... you know... controlling their kids.\n\nHopefully your \"rudeness\" will make them think twice before they book an outing like that again.", "The apologies we\u2019re performative, I hope they left their server a fat tip for putting up with that. NTA", "NTA. If the parents apologized once and then prevented their kids from being out of control, that would have been appropriate. Kids should be kids in kid spaces and learn to behave in mixed and adult spaces.", "NTA\n\nFour apologies for the same thing, is really just lip service. If the parents of these children were called out for their lack of supervision each time, they would probably be better supervisors.", "NTA Normally I would say just complain to the server or restaurant management. But the parent initiated direct contact with you. If they didn't want a rude response they shouldn't have allowed the children to act in such a way.\n\nIf the children refused to behave the parents' group could have imposed consequences such as telling them the team won't be allowed to a restaurant in the future, they will have to do extra wind sprints, or they would have to leave immediately without eating the next time a player misbehaves. This is not difficult, they were just too lazy/worried about being their kids' \"friends\" to parent properly.\n\nIf they had enough awareness that the kids were disturbing others, they should have dealt with the behavior instead of making milquetoast apologies. They were totally weak, entitled and rude.", "NTA.  As a father of 2 boys I can say yes, they need to control their kids.  It\u2019s about time someone told them so.", "NTA\nI love kids, I have kids, we took them to restaurants for all their lives, which is fireing back spectacularly now since they insist on still going with us every single time. I promise they never behaved like that because they knew there would be consequences. \"If you don't stop I'll have to ask you again\" is not a consequence. \"You'll sit next to me instead of with your friends\" or \"we'll pick up the food and leave\" is.", "NTA what\u2019s the point of apologizing if you\u2019re not enforcing anything to stop the inappropriate behaviors. The children could have been hurt with hot plates of food coming out and they couldn\u2019t care less.", "NTA. \"You don't have to be rude about the fact we're allowing our kids to be rude!\"", "NTA Wait Staff are not babysitters. Parents who sit back and passively watch their kids run riot in restaurants are AHs.", "NTA. And as a restaurant worker, thank you so much for saying what all of the employees were probably thinking but aren't allowed to say.", "NTA I'm tired of all the \"kids are just being kids\" BS. I was involved in several different sports teams growing up and there was always a coach or parents keeping an eye on everyone. There were actually times where my team was praised by bus drivers for being well behaved. Kids misbehaving should not be ignored just because it's inevitable, especially by a WHOLE TABLE of parents. \n\nThem going and apologizing to your table is not even the bare minimum that they should have been doing. Sure your response was harsh, but those parents really do need a wake up call", "NTA,  I would have said something ever worse.  Parents should leave the kids home if they can't keep them under control.   In a case like this the parents need to be told to leave by the restaurant staff.", "NTA - it was a public space, to be enjoyed by all, and that means having courtesy for other. No one else was enjoying the space, evident by their constant apologies.\n\nThose parents didn\u2019t have any courtesy for others, as apologizing was easier than actually controlling the chaos. I\u2019m sure if they were on an adult night out, and were met with the same there be convos with managers.", "NTA. This should never have happened. After the first apology, action should have been taken to make the children comply with restaurant standards.", "NTA. I can't stand when parents let their demon spawns just run wild and ruin everything for others trying to have a nice night", "NTA - good for you! Reading this gave me a good laugh imagining the parent's reaction, but it needed to be said.", "NTA. \n\nImo, some parents really need to learn how to supervise their kids in public places without needing others to \"complain\" about it. \n\nIf they can bring their kids with them, they are responsible to keep their eyes and \"control\" the kids as well. It's not the others' business to have to keep their eyes on somebody else's kids and keep silent if the kids bother them, just because \"they're kids\".", "NTA. That kind of bs really pisses me off at a restaurant. If they want to let their kids run around like animals, they need to be at a Chuck E Cheese.", "NTA. The other party are the AHs and obviously were never disciplined growing up. Let me use this word (I always hated it).....RESPECT. If you can not control your kids, you were also raised wrong.", "If you had said that at the beginning then maaayyyybbbeee you would be an asshole.  But after their lazy & insulting fake apologies?  NTA.", "NTA. Youth hockey is notorious for this behavior. You should see how they are in hotels. The parents gather in a public space to get drunk all night, while their unsupervised kids tear the place up. There's always exceptions, but generally this is how they are.", "NTA\n\nSorry but my parents would have reigned me in bc I knew better than to be an A in public. Those kids' parents have no authority bc they raised them that way.", "NTA.  Apologies without change are not sincere apologies.", "NTA.\n\nAs a parent, lord help my kids if they ever pulled that crap in a restaurant. Part of the deal of being an adult who's responsible for kids is modeling behavior in adult situations (like going out to eat)\n\nI know some people are saying you suck too because you should have expected a sports bar type restaurant to be loud, but there's loud and there's \"using the place like a jungle gym\" and  trashing it to boot.\n\nServer probably couldn't say anything to the adults in charge so you did. This is the exact perfect sitiation for a public shaming.", "It\u2019s about time someone told them so.", "NTA, but you might be my hero! I\u2019m the least assertive person and need more friends like you.", "NTA, say that every time to shitty parents", "NTA. Repeated apologies are no use. They knew there was a problem but didn't really want to do anything about it. You weren't the ones being rude.", "NTA\n\nI hate it when people do this.  Obviously kids are going to be a little crazy, and I'm OK with that up to a point, but some parents just let their kids go absolutely crazy and do nothing to control them, which I think is super rude to everyone else.  It doesn't have to be perfect but parents should at least keep their kids somewhat under control.\n\nCaveat- I probably would have used a little less harsh language but same overall message.  You could have said the same thing without calling them shitty parents and they probably would have been more likely to actually do something.  If you were nice about it, they might actually try to get the kids under control but since you were rude they're just going to blow you off.", "NTA. \n\nI was a server for years and had more than my share of parties just like that. My partner had one where one of the children stabbed him in the leg with a steak knife (rounded tip with a serrated edge) and the parents just laughed! People that think it's ok to let their children behave like that in a restaurant super mega suck. If they're letting that go on, they absolutely DO need harsher words to get it through their thick skull that there are OTHER PEOPLE there. \n\nSports parties should be backyard BBQs or something similar. They're an absolute nightmare.", "NTA. What happened to the staff at the restaurant? they are AHs too.", "NTA. They were being inconsiderate and neglectful. The fact they repeatedly apologized showed they were at least somewhat aware, they just didn\u2019t care enough to properly monitor their children. Calling them shitty parents may have been a bit far, but your point was understandable.", "NTA. You're paying to eat, and also a certain experience when going out to a restaurant. Poor behavior by others ruins that. Especially crying babies, and out of control kids. Clearly, the parents knew the kids were being little AH's since they kept apologizing. If kids can't behave properly in public, then they shouldn't go out. Rent a private room, or have it a parents home.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been waiting tables since high school (and will probably continue to do so even as I finally finish grad school 15 years later) and kids running around is a huge problem. I once saw a server trip over a toddler (that was toddling all over the restaurant with no parental supervision) while *carrying a pot of coffee and a tray of mimosas*. Kid went to the hospital (he was okay, just minor bruises and burns) and hopefully the parents learned a valuable lesson- but ilike A LOT of people do this. Y\u2019all, don\u2019t wait for this to happen to your kid, it could have been WAY worse. Don\u2019t seat yourselves away from your kids (or ask us to give them their own table). Don\u2019t assume the waitstaff will babysit them.\n\nEDIT: huge thank you on behalf of all servers for giving your server an extra nice tip. You\u2019re one of the people that make the job doable and you are appreciated.", "NTA. Some of these comments are wild. They were in a sports bar, not Chuck E. Cheese. As a parent, if you get up four times to apologize to surrounding tables at a restaurant for your kid\u2019s behavior without doing anything meaningful to correct the behavior, you\u2019re being a shitty parent. It doesn\u2019t mean overall you\u2019re a shitty parent, but in that situation, you are. It\u2019s also not on the poor servers to try to manage the kids\u2019 behavior. Can you imagine the scene if the restaurant staff tried to kick them out?", "As a server thank you so much for saying what we can\u2019t!", "Nta", "NTA and thank you for confronting the parent and not screaming at the kids like some other psycho on this sub did.", "NTA.  Those parents suck and ruin shit for everyone.", "NTA, it\u2019s poor parenting. If my kid did this I\u2019d be leaving the restaurant and making sure to give her something to cry about OUTSIDE. The kids are old enough to know better and any inaction on parents\u2019 part just screams \u2018I am an enabler\u2019. They need to train their kids better.", "I mean I probably would have gone with \"Don't bother coming over to apologize if you aren't going to do anything about their behavior, it'll stop wasting both of our time.\" But yea NTA. Just, in the future, maybe try to take a moment before replying so you won't completely shut down the situation if that's what you feel bad about. But in my opinion them constantly apologizing was just adding insult to injury, making your response deserved. \n\n8-10 is old enough to know how to act in a restaurant even with your friends. And if they couldn't act right then confiscate the menus, run the receipts and leave. Its not to hard to put your foot down. Its multiple parents for what's essentially a single classroom worth of kids. Put on some grown up pants and parent.", "This one's tough for me, because I do think there were other ways to address it that would've been more productive than calling someone a shitty parent. \n\nTHAT SAID, if the shoe fits... \n\nThe apologies weren't sincere - they clearly weren't! - as no real effort was actually made to meaningfully fix the kids' behavior. It was just something for them to say so they could feel better about themselves and justify their kids' continued behavior. \n\nHad you seen them make actual attempts to corral the kids in between apologies, I'd probably judge this E S H - they'd still be the assholes for not just packing it in and taking the kids home, but I'd then judge you an asshole as well for calling someone a shitty parent who is at least trying to parent. \n\nBut as that is absolutely not what happened here - NTA. \n\nCould you have responded to her in a different way or engaged the management? Sure. \n\nBut if they're going to come at you with repeated fake apologies while their kids still act like they're outside in their backyard, it's understandable how you'd get fed up with it and eventually call a spade a spade.", "NTA sports teams/families (specifically hockey) are the absolute worse to wait on", "NTA - if they are taking out such a large group of kids and let then run wild they should have booked a separate room or go to McDonalds.", "NTA. \n\nI was a server for a long time and I absolutely hate this. A restaurant is not an amusement park. I was always afraid that a kid would get underfoot while I had something hot, and there\u2019d be an accident and the kid would get burned. And you know the parents would want the server\u2019s head, and not take the blame themselves for bad parenting. \n\nAs a current teacher, I can tell you exactly which kids have parents who let them behave this way. Because they do it at school, too. \n\nI really could go on a whole rant about the problems caused by the lack of proper parenting. But I won\u2019t. This time.", "Nta. I'm a server, and hockey teams frequently come in. \n\n*Usually* the children are well behaved, and it's the parents, specifically the mothers, who are complete assholes. \n\nBut they do the exact same thing. Sit separately. Mixed parties per table. Need to organize and split bills based on jersey numbers. It's always a group of 20 to 30 and it makes it impossible to split the group into multiple servers because the party is complete disorganized chaos.\n\nAs someone who can't tell them how much they suck and we all hate them, thank you.", "Nta\n\nIf someone apologizes for something more than once, they aren't sorry and they plan on doing nothing to fix what they are apologizing for. They should have brought the kids to a chuck-e-cheese, not a sports bar.", "As a former server, I can tell you the hockey families when they come in as a large group are the absolute worst. Thank you for saying what I would have loved to say a million times.", "NTA\n\nThese kind of \"team party\" situations should be required to be held in a separate, rented space of the restaurant. That's obnoxious af.", "Isn\u2019t this a repost, but before you yelled at kid", "NTA it is actually refreshing to see someone actually call anyone out for bad behavior.", "NTA. Parents that don\u2019t control their kids or teach them how to behave in restaurants deserve to be called out.", "NTA with a a very soft YTA for not asking the manager to handle this first. That's the manager's job (even though controlling their clown car of kids was the parents' jobs). I have a bunch of grown kids and cannot tell you how many times I loaded them into the car after poor public behavior. Eventually they learned that dining out is a privilege. If i wanted to hang out with my fellow parents, we piled our $ for a group of sitters to watch the kids together.", "ESH. Yes they should have controlled their kids better, but your reaction was WAY over the top. You don\u2019t get to cuss out someone like that in public when they were just trying to apologize for OTHER PEOPLES kids as well. You didn\u2019t mention ANY OTHER parents in the group trying to take responsibility. But no, cuss out the ONE PARENT who cares enough to apologize. Maybe you should try to control YOURSELF before you judge CHILDREN for their behavior.", "You answered your own questions. Why the hell would they want to ruin their night? Why would anyone care more about you than themselves? do you care more about them than you do yourself? no...\n\nI have kids, I would never allow this, but you keep asking questions and you know the answer to  your questions. They wanted to avoid screwing over one of the parents so they take them out.", "You are completely justified in \"feeling\" the way you did in this situation.  The parents not controlling their kids and thinking that merely apologizing after the fact was acceptable were wrong.  However, your exact response illustrates the negative change in our society where there is little attempt at conflict resolution in the moment, and now a Defcon 1 approach to communications instead.  Would have worked better for you to say when the second apology was attempted by a parent, \"Hey, I understand you are a big group, but we are trying to enjoy our dinner and it is nearly impossible with the way your kids are acting.  Could you mix up both of your tables so some parents are there to manage the kids?\"\n\nHandling this situation by not only identifying up front the behavior is unacceptable and providing a solution is far better than letting parents apologize 3 times without a response and then blowing up on the 4th time.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nThis was a sports bar, not fine dining. Along with rowdy kids there are asshole loud adults and drunks yelling at screens.  Which is likely why 1) the restaurant agreed to book a table for 25 people; and 2) they weren't dealing with the behaviour themselves.\n\nParents should keep more control of the scene, yeah.  But your reaction was rude and unnecessary as well.", "Having kids is not easy you basically have to arrange your entire life around their moods.   I don\u2019t have kids but my bro and sis (who I am close to) both do and one of the first things I notice is that they both check to see if whatever restaurant we eat at is not only \u201cchild friendly\u201d but has a child menu with actual food children eat (noodles, nuggets etc) and not adult food in child portions.      Even so they get bored easily so a good parent has clever ways of keeping them busy.   Crayons, etc.    But if they cannot then yea they should pay their bill and leave so other people can enjoy their meal.    That all being said I am not sure I would be the one to call a parent out for not doing any of this.   They were TA for allowing the kids to run wild OP was TA for making it more then it needed to be.   So I am calling it a draw.", "ESH, more them than you.\n\n  \nShe's right: You didn't have to be rude about it. Get a manager or something to have an employee wrangle the situation. That way it'll be more effective than table bound vigilante justice and you avoid making a scene yourself.\n\n  \nNot excusing Parents of course, they were unable or unwilling to keep their kids in line and last I checked a sports bar ain't a day care. Shocked they didn't make someone trip or worse.", "YTA.\n\nI get that you were angry, but what did you hope to accomplish with a personal attack against someone who was at least acknowledging that a problem existed?\n\nYou could have asked some questions instead.\n\n\"Do you agree that their behavior is unacceptable? Could you try harder to get the bad behavior to stop? Or should I find the restaurant manager and have them do something?\"\n\nBy calling them shitty parents, you alienated someone who might have been able to help you.", "Also, if you're not a parent you don't know shit, so you shouldn't call someone a bad parent.", "ESH. From the other perspective, I was at one point a kid on that team. And going out to eat with your teammates was SO fucking cool, and usually a big treat. And we often outnumbered the parents who came with us 5/1 or so. There simply was no containing us, they were out of their depth. Kids are dumb, rambunctious, and obnoxious, even more so when they are with a large group of friends. They clearly had the awareness to at least apologize. The Restaurant had more of an obligation to step in and boot them, but they clearly thought the check was worth the trouble. You didn't have to accept their apology, but you also didn't have to escalate it with the type of comments you made. If the restaurant isn't kicking them out or stepping in, then in your shoes I would have made the decision to eat elsewhere.", "I would *love* to hear what great parenting strategies you would have employed specifically to get kids to quiet down in a similar situation. \n\nAlso, i have a hard time imagining that loud, unruly patrons are an uncommon sight for staff at a sports bar.", "YTA.  It\u2019s not like that was one family, it was a bunch of teammates, each of whom had their own parents.  Any given parent could take action with respect to their own child, but not anyone else\u2019s.  The parent who kept coming over to apologize was probably the most aware of the disruption being caused, was the most anxious about it, and thus was probably the most on top of her own kid. And yet that\u2019s the parent you decided to heap your own abuse on.", "ESH.\n\nSo, yes, the family should not have caused a disruption in the restaurant. As guests of a restaurant we all have a responsibility to be respectful of other diners.\n\nBut ultimately, who is responsible for the environment of the restaurant? Bad patrons, sure... they're accountable for themselves - but also the restaurant. The manager should have spoken to them if they were abusing service staff and ruining the experience for other diners. \n\nInstead of trying to discern people's character or punish people for bad behavior with harsh words, we really should let people in a position of authority handle it when possible - if someone isn't about to get hurt.\n\nThe better way to handle it would be to complain to the manager and get the manager's take on the situation. Then the manager could talk to that party or ask them to sit with their children, or something useful.\n\nNowadays, people have guns, knives and short tempers. Telling people off can turn into a violent situation, and it is really not necessary. complain to the manager and let them handle it. If they refuse, don't return to that restaurant.", "ESH. The parents were doing a lousy job controlling the kids. Your response calling them shitty parents went way overboard. Did you complain to the restaurant management? Don't you think you could have gotten your message across without calling them shitty parents? They were out of line and you were a borderline asshole. Maybe your parents were shitty parents who didn't teach their kid manners.", "YTA. So were others in the situation as well though. I get why you felt annoyed but calling someone a shitty parent because their kids are being loud and having fun at a place where lots of people go to have fun is an asshole thing to do. You don\u2019t get the dictate the environment of the restaurant you are in. You and your family could have gone to a quieter restaurant. You weren\u2019t in a movie theater, you were in a busy restaurant. I wonder if you would have yelled if it was a group of men chugging beers and watching a sporting event and cheering loudly. This is what\u2019s wrong with society, people out in public thinking they get to tell people off if they don\u2019t like what they\u2019re doing. If you don\u2019t like it, leave. Was the situation a frustrating one? Sure, but you made it a hostile one.", "ESH. The kids are old enough to know they should be better behaved, the parents should have better crowd control, and you should have worded it better.\n\nI know what a shitty parent is, and this is not it.\n\nETA: Didn't this post originally say 'bad parents'? It says 'shitty' now, and that's why people are getting confused by our responses. I could be wrong", "YTA", "ESH", "YTA. It sucks. The parents suck. But it's a restaurant, not a library, and they don't have to be quiet unless the restaurant owners decide so. It also goes the same for you. If you don't want to be subject to external disturbances, you could've eaten at home.", "You were a bit of an asshole for cursing at the parent, but it is understandable. Your complaint is really with the restaurant; you should have spoken to the manager and insisted that either they address the situation with the parents (up to and including refusing to serve them and asking them to leave), move you to a quieter location, or give you your food to go (no charge).\n\nYour frustration is appropriate, but there was no way cursing at the parent was going to improve the situation.", "Their behavior isn\u2019t caused by poor parenting, it\u2019s packed mentality. Same thing that causes a group of gentlemen to swill beer, cheer loudly and ogle servers during the game at a sports pub. Same thing that causes ladies to cackle and cast judgement on others when in a group. Personally hen fests are more bothersome and annoying to be. Hearing supposedly grown women clucking and throwing venom and shade it more annoying, and much harder to avoid. They are allowed in the bar, where I chose to sit to avoid small children.   \nLike if you knew you were not in the mood to be around children why didn\u2019t you stay home or choose a place children are unwelcome? Give it 10 yrs, unless you choose a childfree lifestyle you will be those parents, and back here posting about the new version of you.", "ESH.\n\nYou and your judgmental family and the group of parents not keep the kids in line. But it was a sports bar. I'm not sure what you expected when you see a large group come in.", "ESH, both you and the parents handled the situation poorly. You didn't need to be that rude about it.", "YTA. I get that you were frustrated, but kids are kids. They can't be \"controlled\", they're human beings. The parents apologised to you - more than once! - but you chose to be TA. YTA.", "YTA, you were right, but still an ass.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We get in and get seated in a booth, everything's going well until a group of like 20-25 parents and kids walk in. It was a boys hockey team (kids look to be 8-10 years old).\n\nFrom the moment this group walked in a already knew it was going to be chaotic. The kids had their own large table, right beside my table coincidentally, and the parents had their own table a few feet away. \n\nThe kids were running around like this place was a jungle gym, running in and out of the bathrooms every 2 mins, screaming so loud my family and I had to yell at each other to communicate, spilling their drinks on the floor. I felt so bad for their server. Even my families server was like to us \"gosh I can't wait to get home and down a glass of wine\" because the kids were just terrible. \n\nAnd what were the parents doing during all this? Absolutely **NOTHING**. They were all just sat at their table drinking their beers talking to each other, as if they're kids are the best behaved kids in the world. \n\nEvery few minutes one of the parents of the kids would walk over to our table and be like \"i'm so sorry for them guys\", go over to the kids table and be like \"guys sit down\" and then go back to the parent table. \n\nAs if simply telling the kids to \"sit down\" is going to work?
