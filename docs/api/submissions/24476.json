Maybe the flu. His immune system is shot from Adderall and working himself to the bone for the past 6mo. \n\nI handle everything in the home, which I'm completely fine with! I just don't have much room in my calender for nursing a sick person back to health lol.   \n\nHe will not or cannot do *anything* for himself except pee. I don't know how feels, maybe it's really that bad. He has always gotten so sick with a cold and MIL says he's been this way.   \n\nBut in my head, it can't be so bad that I need to run up and down the stairs for water, tissues, watch over him like fairy God mother while he stops up a bloody nose for 30 minutes.   \n\n\nReason is, anytime *I've* been sick or in pain, truly crippling pain, he barely bat a lash! I've sprained my ankle, broke my toes, went to the ER to yank out an IUD (worst pain of my life), been so sick I passed out in a ice cold shower.   \n\nHe did nothing for me whatsoever. And I'm not resentful of that, I still went to work and got on with my life. We grew up poor where being injured or sick was a luxury. I have a very high pain tolerance and all this is normal to me.   \n\nBut I figure that if he isn't concerned with illness and pain that way I have experienced it, maybe he doesn't actually feel it as bad? As in, he doesn't actually need all this help.   \n\nOn top of that, I have *horrific* misophonia. I can't tolerate mouth noises of any kind. And **no** it isn't an annoyance with chewing. It's painful and causes panic attacks.  \n\nSo having him fucking swallow snow and sniffle right next to me in bed all night is pure torture. I wear ear plugs, of course... but he will frantically smack my arm for something, then when I pull my ear plug out he fucking waits 5-10 seconds to answer me and SWALLOWS OR SNIFFLES.   \n\nI haven't slept in two days. He refuses to do anything to bring his fever down and getting him to take Tylenol was like convincing a toddler to.  \n\nSo I left my bratty and whining puppy upstairs with him because I just cannot fucking stand either of them right now and I don't know if I should feel bad about it because he's sick.   \n\nAs far as he know, I'm worried he's gonna die. I've been very gentle and kind with him. He has no idea how horrible annoyed I am.    \n\n\nI think I could be an asshole here because the dude is sick and can't help how his body responds to that! He might not know how to support me when I don't feel good but does so in other ways and this is the only time he really \"gets to\" fall apart and have someone baby him.    \n\n\nEdit:  \n\nPuppy, who is actually 10mo,  was only \"left\" in her kennell for 5 minutes and had already been taken potty just 30 seconds before.

Point is, my husband has helped me understand that he\u2019s still going to be doing his own thing, he\u2019s not going to sit and watch me sleep just because I am sick and so he will set up my nightstand with all the necessities and come check on me if I call his phone because I need something specific, but he does bring me things like the thermometer and he will go out and get me electrolyte water, take me to the hospital if I\u2019m not improving etc. \n\nEDIT: he\u2019s not a typical man and I am blessed to have him.

He'd just been handling gardening stuff so I got mostly worried about that... but it was prolly just a bug from Home Depot.", "I don't get the medicine part...I had a low grade fever, I let it do it's job until I couldn't stand it and then popped Advil so I could finally sleep a bit. Like....medicine makes it hurt less.why tf wouldn't you take it???", "Don't be dramatic.", "I can come up with quite a few reasons. But the one I think is most applicable to my man is that he has this immmeeeense pressure to provide and be a strong leader who never complains.  \n\nSo when he does get the chance to not be that, he milks it. And also.. he really does run himself ragged.  \n\nI used to self sabotage by working myself to bone and binge drinking so that I was incapacitated and couldn't be relied on. He hasn't quite figured that out for himself yet.", "Lord have mercy.. this is one post of one very specific situation. Not the apocalypse.", "It gets worse as couples with this imbalance get older.  My stepfather drained my mother dry.  He had a sniffle, she treated him like it was pneumonia.  Even when he was well, she took his meals to him on a tray while he watched TV.  He didn't even know where the spoons were kept so he could make HER a cup of coffee. She was at his beck and call for 35 years.\n\nNow he's dead and she is irrevocably drained of life.", "Girl what am I supposed to do? Tell him I'm annoyed by him when he's sick? There's such a thing as inappropriate/cruel honesty.", "Lol oh god. Best cure for a whiney sick husband? Divorce.", "the part where she says he's been working himself to the bone for 6 months is pretty sad. And the part where he won't go with her to ER when shes sick. Why are these two together? It sounds like they hate eachother\n\ncant imagine treating anyone like that while they are sick or being treated like that now.", "No it doesn't. D- for low effort comment.", ">You say you have horrific misophonia\n\nIf it were me, I'd have been extremely irritated by the mouth and nose sounds because on top of being a nurse to this man, the repetition of sniffles, snots and loud breathing would have driven me to frustration.\n\nWhen I was married, I slept in another room if my husband had man-flu.", "Yea, I'm thinking this is what's going on. He truly feels this sick! And even if he didn't.. I mean, he doesn't get many days of just being \"useless\". Maybe once a year?  \n\nSo far I'm figuring out that I need to discuss with him a better system over all. But he definitely doesn't know how irritated I am! Promise!", "Okay, to be fair, he didn't *know* that I passed out. I guess that was unnecessary info but I just wanted to paint a picture of how I thought we both perceived illness.   \n\nI only mention or tell him I'm not doing good. Then go on with my life and don't expect help. Drove myself to the ER and went to work the same day, that sort of thing.", "Lol yea I think it's part, maybe, truly feeling THAT bad.. and also just wanting to be doted on after stretching himself so thin.   \n\nHis fever is down and he's doing much better. I will discuss with him a better way to handle illness haha", "Puppy was only left in her kennel for maybe 5 min! She is well loved, no worries!   \n\nI hope whatever is wrong with your tummy clears up soon and it's not a long stay.", "Puppy was only left for 5 min! I actually took her out to potty then put her back in to collect myself. Mornings are rough for me lol", "I put more info in comments about the pup. Also, she's not a puppy lol she's 10mo so can handle a lot more alone time than 5 min.", "I hope you are well and recovered now.  \n\nI've lived alone for a long time and got myself through five breast cancer surgeries, including double mastectomy and two scar revisions.  Then came a staph infection.  \n\nThe worst of it was being overcome by feelings of desertion two weeks after each time I was discharged from hospital.  I'm a stranger to so much attention.\n\nIf I needed chemo, I'd have been screwed.  It takes a village to care for someone on chemo.  I was grateful to not need it.", "I hope you have health insurance or his whining could have been costly.", "Why did you agree to a puppy he wants but wants you to care for??? Maybe someone else would be a better home where it's wanted and cared for by all inhabitants of the home. And your husband sounds awful.", "Yeah I really don't like your attitude toward the puppy here at all, OP. Really shitty. Having a dog is a luxury. Puppy is helpless and relies on you. Your husband isn't gonna die, he can fend for himself. \n\nSort it out.", "Lots of Florences are lovely nurturing people in other areas of their lives...they just don't deal with sick adults very well especially those that ham it up and lay it on with a shovel. \n\nYou may not have caught it yet. I have worked in education (smalls) for years and there is no rhyme nor reason to who gets what when or why...You may already have it but it's still worth taking precautions in case you haven't.", "He very well could be this type of sick person.  \n\nI mean, I tolerate many kinds of pain or illness. But I lose function of my entire limb if I have a broken nail or hang nail \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \n\nWe'll talk this over and figure out a better system because this is not working haha!", "He needs standing lmao", "Dude, he won\u2019t take Tylenol. He doesn\u2019t get a pity vote because he\u2019s acting incompetent. \n\nNTA.", "> Because I know his immune system is weakened\n\nHow do you know that?  Did a doctor say so?\n\n> It's not all his fault, the way he is.\n\nHe's an adult.  He can change his behavior if he wants to.", "He needs therapy then. It's definitely his fault if he's choosing to hurt himself by working himself to sickness out of choice then expecting you to pick up the pieces. He's got a cold and refuses to take meds and expects you to wait on him hand and foot. That's not normal and he needs to learn to do basic care tasks for himself. He's not a toddler.", "You can't help him stop being that way, he's a fully formed adult and that is how he is. He sounds terrible tbh. If you want someone different then find someone who actually takes care of both you and themselves", "Well if he's caring and supportive in others ways, why can't you be bothered to care for him? The first five years with my husband, I hated caring for him during his annual flu. He gets the shakes, can barely breathe, aches all over. Worse than me. It took a lot of communicating on the difference of care required. We've been together 11 years. I brush this man's long hair so it doesn't get matted when he's sick. And on the other hand, he's showered me and fed me while I wasn't even sick. You're probably suffering because of your condition (I'm sorry I can't remember the name) and care give burnout. But the way you're handling this and the way its written sounds resentful. \n\n>I'm generally a very independent person and when it comes to illness\n\n>I didn't complain at all when I was hurt or sick\n\nThis might get me downvoted or seen as rude, but just because you didn't complain when you could have doesn't mean you get to lord it over his head now.", "Someone explained to me that for many people in our background, medicine is avoided. I didn't take any kind of meds at all until I went to the ER a few years ago nd the nurse was like \"Wtf, you don't have to be in this much pain dude...\"   \n\nIn my family, it was about distrust in doctors and anything related to what they might prescribe as well as \"that shit costs as much as my dinner!\" .", "Exactly! While you\u2019re at it, take some NyQuil to clear out the snot and get some sleep. A person can heal so much better when they get decent sleep.", "Because being sick garners more attention so stay sick.", "Not being dramatic. For me being married is about taking care of each other, having someone you know will be in your corner when you are at your most vulnerable. I have been married for 30 years. I would not have stayed married if I couldn\u2019t count on my husband when I was ill and he couldn\u2019t count on me. For you maybe it\u2019s dramatic for me it\u2019s reality. Some of us take the whole in sickness and health thing seriously.", "If you don't stand your ground with this man now, it will be apocalyptic in a few decades.", "But it isn't just one event. When she is injured or sick, and she cites many examples, he does nothing. He has established a pattern of behavior that does no include caring for her, only for himself.", "You are annoyed by him and he doesn't know it. You have to communicate with him before you get annoyed so resentment doesn't build up. Expressing feelings and setting boundaries is not cruel by default. It all depends how you do that. Bubbling it all up will result in an explosion which would be cruel, don't you think?", "You shouldn\u2019t take care of him at all. He didn\u2019t take care of you so don\u2019t take care of him what so ever see how he likes it", "Glad to hear it. One of the more genuine posts on this sub haha", "Glad puppy is happy. I have 3 kitties myself. As for my tummy is probably pancreatitis which I get occasionally ever since I had my gall bladder removed. Hospital is super busy so am still in waiting room until room opens up.", "Cool, no worries then", "He did have insurance, but it didn't cover it all. Paying that bill was his lesson and it worked well for the rest of our relationship and I imagine it stuck for future relationships.", "You sound like you can't read and overreact a little too often.", "I adore her and she gets everything she wants/needs. Little brat was left for all of 5 minutes!  \n\nAlthough I didn't want another dog, she is a blessing in my life and can't see it without her :)", "Haha, well it just might be me then! I'll definitely try to better avoid getting the ick. Dude gets paid sick days, I don't lol.", "Thanks for the perspective! I just didn't know if I should continue caring for him in this way.", "Medicine is avoided so he won't take Tylenol, but he takes so much Adderal that it affects his immune system?  This isn't adding up.", "Ah I see, yeah where I am from and how I was raised, you go see a doctor and get help. Makes a world of difference.\n\nLike currently I have a stomach virus or food poisoning (I think) I got on Thursday, low to mid grade fever of 100-103, only hit 103 once but if I had kept going over 103 I'd have went to Urgent Care. \n\nTook some Aleve last night, got some rest, took some more.this morning, finally registered under a fever temp. As long as that stays the same I won't go to doctor.\n\nI will say having a fever fucks my world up, my head aches and throbs my entire body is weak and hot. I basically have to lie down until it stops. Idk if that's just a me thing or what though.", "Yea, I guess we need to start taking physical health more seriously. But this one tiny bit of information is not an entire description of our marriage.  \n\nPeople have different marriage from yours. I'll listen to other perspectives and advise if it's actually helpful. But hitting the \"DIVORCE\" button is lazy.", "I gave more details on this in my comments. Neither of us care about our bodies and he is the only one who makes it known when there is a \"body\" problem.. and that is when he has a cold lol", "This is true. I just have been working on regulating my emotions before I act on them but... I also do have a habit of bottling them up anyway lol.  \n\nSome comments have advised to talk about this with him when he is better.", "And you sound like you want to vent and don't really want to hear anything anyone has to say. Good luck. This isn't the place for coddling.", "You\u2019re abandoning a puppy because your husband is pissing you off? You got a puppy and YOU are responsible for that dog (so is your husband when he is better). You have a lot of pent up anger and are taking it out on an innocent animal? N T A for being angry at your husband, Y T A for neglecting/abusing a puppy to whine to Reddit about how unfair your life is. Do that dog a favor and give it to someone who cares for it. And as for yourself, take control of your life and treat yourself better.", "You're welcome :)\n\nTalk to him and set out guidelines. Tell him you're feeling burnt out while also not making him feel like a complete burden. \n\nAs someone independent, it took a lot to get to where my husband and I are now. Looking back, I laugh at all the things that could've been handled with boundaries and conversing.", "Lmao right? I was mistaken about the Adderall thing.. there isn't *enough* Adderall for him to abuse lmao.", "You missed the part where I said go to therapy first and see if you can start supporting each other. This keeping score and treating each other poorly because the other one did is very toxic.", "I see lots of people staying in unhappy marriages because it's easier than divorce and starting over. Divorce definitely isn't a lazy option.", "I have heard plenty other people here. I just happen to think you aren't worth listening to.", "Puppy was \"abandoned\" in her kennel for all of 5 minutes, max. I need to retrain her not to scream at me the second she wakes up, though.  \n\nRest assured, this brat is very spoiled. I was more concerned about it annoying him.", "Calm down she put the yappy puppy upstairs to take a break from the noise. It's not being abused or neglected its with husband. They can nap together. You're being really dramatic.", "But he takes it, right?  So there's no reason for him not to take Tylenol and cold medicine.", "I must have gotten you mixed up with all the other very generic reddit comments that are either \"therapy *now*\" or \"leave his ass!\" .  \n\nNo one is keeping score. I gave a bit more detail in my comments. Don't think there needs to be anymore.", "Telling people to just divorce is lazy. Especially when it's about something so insignificant.", "Then why are you bothering to respond?", "Yea dude this is actually the biggest mind fuck rn lmao", "You wouldn't be here if you were happy.", "Him not taking care of you when you\u2019re sick and you not taking him seriously when he is sick is not insignificant. It\u2019s unfortunate.", "Because I'm bored you're entertaining", "Look, just because you run to reddit like it's your depression diary doesn't mean everyone else does", "Well you're not so entertaining so guess I'm out.", "You're the one posting. Not me. Very defensive. Maybe some of these comments ring true.", "What took you so long?", "I'm just having fun with a reactionary person. Don't take everything so seriously, is what I'm saying."]}
