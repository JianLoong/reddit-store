Maybe the flu. His immune system is shot from Adderall and working himself to the bone for the past 6mo. \n\nI handle everything in the home, which I'm completely fine with! I just don't have much room in my calender for nursing a sick person back to health lol.   \n\nHe will not or cannot do *anything* for himself except pee. I don't know how feels, maybe it's really that bad. He has always gotten so sick with a cold and MIL says he's been this way.   \n\nBut in my head, it can't be so bad that I need to run up and down the stairs for water, tissues, watch over him like fairy God mother while he stops up a bloody nose for 30 minutes.   \n\n\nReason is, anytime *I've* been sick or in pain, truly crippling pain, he barely bat a lash! I've sprained my ankle, broke my toes, went to the ER to yank out an IUD (worst pain of my life), been so sick I passed out in a ice cold shower.   \n\nHe did nothing for me whatsoever. And I'm not resentful of that, I still went to work and got on with my life. We grew up poor where being injured or sick was a luxury. I have a very high pain tolerance and all this is normal to me.   \n\nBut I figure that if he isn't concerned with illness and pain that way I have experienced it, maybe he doesn't actually feel it as bad? As in, he doesn't actually need all this help.   \n\nOn top of that, I have *horrific* misophonia. I can't tolerate mouth noises of any kind. And **no** it isn't an annoyance with chewing. It's painful and causes panic attacks.  \n\nSo having him fucking swallow snow and sniffle right next to me in bed all night is pure torture. I wear ear plugs, of course... but he will frantically smack my arm for something, then when I pull my ear plug out he fucking waits 5-10 seconds to answer me and SWALLOWS OR SNIFFLES.   \n\nI haven't slept in two days. He refuses to do anything to bring his fever down and getting him to take Tylenol was like convincing a toddler to.  \n\nSo I left my bratty and whining puppy upstairs with him because I just cannot fucking stand either of them right now and I don't know if I should feel bad about it because he's sick.   \n\nAs far as he know, I'm worried he's gonna die. I've been very gentle and kind with him. He has no idea how horrible annoyed I am.    \n\n\nI think I could be an asshole here because the dude is sick and can't help how his body responds to that! He might not know how to support me when I don't feel good but does so in other ways and this is the only time he really \"gets to\" fall apart and have someone baby him.    \n\n\nEdit:  \n\nPuppy, who is actually 10mo,  was only \"left\" in her kennell for 5 minutes and had already been taken potty just 30 seconds before. I was just feeling assy because she demand barks and he's got a headache.   \n\nEdit 2:  \n\nI gotta clear some stuff up and reading over this post, I wrote it poorly.  \n\n1. I didn't leave the dog out of spite lol. I have a hard time in the mornings and she yells the second she wakes up so I usually take 5-10 minutes out of the room, to collect myself and fully wake up before handling her.  This could have been done differently today since he's sick.   \n\n2. Explaining some of the times I've been in bad shape was *not* to say he doesn't care about me and the way I wrote it definitely paints that picture, so that's my bad. I guess I'm just not as obvious as he is when I'm not okay and so I assumed he knew but shared my perspective on this sort of thing. When it comes to my mental health, husband is my hero. When the pain *is* too obvious to hide, he's upset about it.", "created_utc": 1691843289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15p3cor/aita_for_not_waiting_hand_and_foot_on_my_very/", "score": 516, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Point is, my husband has helped me understand that he\u2019s still going to be doing his own thing, he\u2019s not going to sit and watch me sleep just because I am sick and so he will set up my nightstand with all the necessities and come check on me if I call his phone because I need something specific, but he does bring me things like the thermometer and he will go out and get me electrolyte water, take me to the hospital if I\u2019m not improving etc. \n\nEDIT: he\u2019s not a typical man and I am blessed to have him.

So I was a bit lost on how to handle this situation.", "my dad went from a pretty ripped man with a six pack to being emaciated.   he hasn't eaten solid food in 18 months and takes his meals by stomach tube.  he struggles to lift anything over 3lbs and has begun falling from being lightheaded.\n\nwe drive him to chemo.", "The nerves in my mum's hands and feet were damaged from chemo and she wasn't sure if she could even safely drive anymore. We drove her to and from chemo & radio.", "Holy shit. They deserved help tho. People get used to doing for themselves, but like. It's good to have help. You know? I want to hug them and give them soup.", "Cancer sucks.", "He actually beat cancer.  He just never started eating and now there's new stage 4 cancer.  \n\nI dropped off almost 30lbs of blueberries to him yesterday as he wants to make wine.  He sleeps very little and spends a lot of time awake and alone.  He cooks pots and pans of foods he can't eat, seals/freezes it washes the dishes, and listens to music.  I think he's subconsciously 'nesting' in a way, but for his own death not a new baby.", "NTA but you sure you want to be married to someone who doesnt take care of you when you\u2019re in need?", "Don\u2019t know why you would stay for someone who can\u2019t even / won\u2019t take care of you when you\u2019re sick but NTA. Just an AH to yourself", "definitely NTA- he\u2019s a grown man and needs to be able to take care of himself, especially if he isn\u2019t returning the favor by help you when you\u2019re sick. it\u2019s embarrassing on his behalf honestly. \n\nlast year i (21f) had an extreme case of COVID and was almost hospitalized. i was alone also with a new puppy, who is a german shepherd mix so she\u2019s HUGE and can be extremely difficult. some days i could barely stand but still managed to take care of myself and my dog. as a grown man, he should be able to do the same with a flu.", "Are you married to MY husband too?\n\nNTA", "You're brave. I had a horrible kidney infection and had to ask my mother to drive me to the doctor.", "Yeah I get the man flu, and it\u2019s because I feel way sicker than I should considering the paltry little cold I got!  Like, I\u2019m not making it up, but I am being a baby.  I can turn into a useless lump but I don\u2019t take it out on my partner and I definitely return the favor.", "In the case of my uncle, he knows he can always come stay with us if he needs to but he would rather stay independent. It has always been his choice to do everything for himself. Right now, he's done with chemo but still getting immune therapy every 3 weeks, he's looking into going away, maybe to Vegas, in the fall.", "Obviously, the sarcasm was lost on you. Do I remember the actual diagnosis no, because this happened 20 some years ago. I am sure it was something along the lines of common cold. So, in other words, whining.", "He\u2019s pathetic and I doubt he could afford a 24/7 maid, nurse, etc. no matter how much he works.", "NTA\n\nGive him the same, or slightly better, treatment he would give you. You need to guard your own sanity, too. Also, fever reducers aren't recommended unless the fever is high. Fevers help us get rid of viruses quicker. Just make sure the fever doesn't get TOO high.", "YTA. No kids. No job. What exactly do you contribute to this guy who supports you? What am I missing? Please fill me in", "Why are you two even together, you hate everything from the way he eats to getting mad when he's sick.", "Is it COVID? Why are you sleeping in the same room as someone who's sick? You could catch whatever he has?? It's too early for the flu. It's likely COVID if he's actually feeling this bad. Sleep in another room.", "Haha. Yes, we can share.", "It was at 102 for a few hours but now it's back down to 98 since this morning. Says he doesn't feel feverish anymore but feels sicker.  \n\nUgh goooood... I hate when he's sick. He's so miserable :(", "I make really great tacos.", "Because we both new this post would be made 6 years later and that you would read it and write some random comment about it.", "I am so sorry he's torturing you like this. When he's better, you two need to sit down and come up with an equitable plan for when each of you gets ill. Communication and compromise. He needs to give what he takes. And right now, I can feel how drained you are. It's too much and there needs to be some give and take.", "I had no choice. Crazy what you can do when you have no choice.", "Bingo!\nThat's how I am with my family [no boyfriend] I will help them in every way I can...but it stops of they just don't act like they care.\n\nWhich is exactly what my brother acts like. He gets the manflu but has literally watched me have a seizure before his very eyes and done NOTHING. Yeah F that, he is on his own.\nMy sister and Mom get a nurse though, however like me they prefer to quarantine themselves when sick. XD\n\nOP is NTA.\nDude can handle his cold and/or flu while she sleeps and does stuff. Bringing stuff like lunch or dinner should be the most of it...maybe water if he's pretty weak.", ">He did nothing for me whatsoever. And I'm not resentful of that.\n\nyou should be Y T A to yourself.  \n\n\nNTA with the clarification that 10 month old puppy was only left for a bit until you regained your sanity", ">but he will frantically smack my arm for something,\n\nHell! No! \n\n>I've sprained my ankle, broke my toes, went to the ER to yank out an IUD (worst pain of my life), been so sick I passed out in a ice cold shower.\n\nHe did nothing for me whatsoever.\n\nI can't. Can these go back to relationship subs.", "this sounds like a horrible relationship", "NTA - But stop babying him. His mother did that but you shouldn't. . . It is annoying. Just put all the stuff he needs next to him and tell him you need to stay away so you don't get sick. Make some hot chicken noodle soup and make him feed himself. Two or three times a day for a very short time is enough time for you to be in there. Wear a mask and wash your hands. You don't want to get sick because he won't take care of YOU!", "oof why do y\u2019all stay married to people like this \u2026 \nNTA", "Totally.  When my husband and I started dating I went over to his apartment to look after him when he was sick.  He had a fever so I made an ice pack to put on his forehead.  After I did that he whined that I didn't sit by his bedside to wipe his face with cold cloths like his mommy did when he was sick as a child.  It didn't help matters that his mom treated me horribly.  I immediately left and didn't come back while he was sick.  That was in '97 or and he's never done that crap again.", "We called it Nancy Nurse.", "Okay, well then I don't really know how to judge this. Also, one cannot help swallowing and sniffing when one is ill, and usually, some level of brain-fog comes with the fever. If you've been nice to him so far (not counting the dog incident), then I guess NAH. He should definitely take something to bring his fever down though. Is he any better?", "I had 107\u00b0 once. It was so bad. My balance was all messed up, I could barely walk, because when your temp is that high it's affecting your brain.", "Should probably just divorce him and take the house. \u201cSickness and health\u201d vows be damned. Fuck that guy. /s\n\nYTA. It\u2019s okay to be the asshole in private. Sometimes my kids annoy the shit out of me. I don\u2019t tell them that, or do anything childish like leave a barking puppy in their room or anything though. They\u2019re oblivious to my frustration while I still care for them. \n\nTo recap, yes, you are the asshole. Unless you\u2019d be 100% okay with your husband treating you the same way when *you\u2019re sick*, you might want to buck up and help the poor guy out.", ">It's called the \"man flu\". \n\nI don't know why that's in scare quotes, it's a very well documented phenomena. Male immune responses are significantly more aggressive, and it's the immune response rather than the infection that makes you feel like death.\n\nHeck we saw the phenomena in action recently with COVID, where much like the 1918 Spanish flu it was the immune response overeaction itself killing people - and in both cases men died at a higher rate.", "Thanks for the chart! I\u2019m actually reading this with some sort of sickness and now I think it\u2019s influenza!", "And silence your phone. I bet he would try to call you to get what he so desperately needs..."]}
