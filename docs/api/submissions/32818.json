You are an AH for posting on Reddit and not going to a lawyer with your concerns to stop this.", "NTA\n\n\" In our court papers he put the morale clause in there...\"\n\nHe put that in there, so he has to live with it.", "NTA\n\nIt's his clause.", "Nta. He\u2019s violating the clause.", "NTA. He put that clause in the court papers. He has to abide by it.", "NTA. Also NTA before your update. He wanted that clause, so be it. After the update you should under no circumstances let your kids be near her.", "NTA\n\nIf the clause is in your custody agreement then you both have to abide by it no matter who had it put there.", "NTA, especially if you're worried for their safety", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t have put in the morale clause if he didn\u2019t want to follow his own rules. Your concerns are valid. Would he have allowed you this exception of the rule if it was you in this scenario?", "Is that actually legal? Can you write anything in a divorce agreement and cops/the law has to enforce it? Like if he has his gf stay at his house, you can call the police, show him that document and they\u2019d make her leave? Doesn\u2019t seem like a real thing. Can someone explain this?", "So he asked for the \"moral cause\" to be put into the court papers which states no overnight stays with the opposite gender while having the kids?", "Why is that clause in the agreement?  This is what matters most in this situation.  \n\nIf it\u2019s in there because either of you has concern about the kids getting attached to a continuous line of ever disappearing girlfriends / boyfriends then sure, yes, it should be an either or situation and NTA.\n\nBut if it\u2019s in there for general purposes or an old reason that was there years ago when a child had a particular issue / hard time emotionally and at this point it\u2019s just a small detail that should be removed but it\u2019s cheaper not to have to go back to court to have it removed then YTA.", "INFO: How does this work? So neither of you are basically allowed to get into a serious and committed relationship? What if he marries this person? Is his wife not allowed to live with him when your kids are there?\n\nI'm leaning towards YTA. Just because you may have a legal backing here doesn't mean you aren't the asshole.", "NTA. take care of business", "NTA because you have an agreement that should be honoured.", ">So, am I the ass hole for telling my ex that his GR can\u2019t go cause of this and that he will either take or kids and not his GR or don\u2019t take our kids and GF can go\n\nAre you in the right? Sure. But you can still be the AH. Are you actually concerned about something or is this just you being petty?", "oh for fuck's sake he's going to a funeral\nYTA (morally)", "ESH. But seriously document that she hit your kid. You won\u2019t have to worry about no sleepovers when she\u2019s not allowed to be around your kids. \n\nIf you with this, be prepared, go to court ASAP because your ex will try to retaliate", "YTA - what are you hoping to achieve?", "YTA.  You may be technically allowed to but that does not mean you are not a major AH nonetheless.", "YTA. He's not going on a vacation. It's his grandmother's funeral, and he's likely to want the support of his partner during this tough time. Likewise, the kids will want to say goodbye to their great grandmother.\n\nLegally, you may get your way. Morally, it's horribly controlling.", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, you can't \"forbid\" anything here.  If he has the children on his time, and he decides to go to his grandmother's funeral, and he decides to take his girlfriend along, AND you have some proof of them sleeping together, THEN you have ONE instance of him violating the morality clause.\n\nYou would need multiple instances of this, or evidence that she was in fact living full time at his address, for you to get anywhere with this in court.  And what you would be going for is full physical custody, so that he can't expose your children to further immorality.\n\nWhich is fine, but it does nothing to keep your ex's GF from threatening your kids or anything else during waking hours.\n\nSo let him go to the funeral.  And if you have a reason to file for custody or to file a restraining order against his GF, then do that.", "I\u2019m going to take all of this with a massive grain of salt, so with that I\u2019ll say YTA. This isn\u2019t a typical scenario so I think some compassion would go a long way since there was a death involved, plus it\u2019s not like she\u2019s staying over at his house, it sounds like they\u2019re all traveling together. \n\nOf course you don\u2019t like the new girlfriend so you might be exaggerating when you say she once threatened to hit a kid and confessed to doing drugs. What was the context when she threatened to hit the kid? \u201cYou stop teasing your brother or I\u2019ll give you a spanking!\u201d is harmeless. If she straight up said \u201cI hate you I want to punch you in the face!\u201d Then I understand your concern. Also what \u201cdrugs\u201d and is she a current user? Bc someone that smokes pot every once in a while is not equal to a daily heroin user. Without knowing more details it kinda sounds like you\u2019re grasping at straws to find a reason to make your ex miserable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he put it in there not for the best interest of the kids but so that you won\u2019t be able to date and include the kids in the mix, then what\u2019s good for you is good for him.  If he now sees that it shouldn\u2019t apply to him in this situation, AND YOU AGREE IT SHOULDN\u2019T BE A CONDITION AT ALL, then he can pay to have it removed.  \n\nHave him arrange with his lawyer to draw up the agreement for his lawyer and your lawyer to send to the court having it removed as a mutual agreed request.
