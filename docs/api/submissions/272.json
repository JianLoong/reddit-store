I work remotely and the plan was that after he lost his previous job (around March/April) he would find a remote job too so we could work and travel abroad. It's not too easy to make it possible, but there are options. I was hoping that he could start a new job by the beginning of summer, which did not happen. He applied to some places but they either did not respond or he did not pass the test. I have been looking for options for him too but either he is not interested or says he is not suitable for them. I agree that sometimes it can be the case but he has done nothing to gain new/more valuable skills either that could help getting more replies. There have been times where I have to constantly remind him to send his resume to places as he says he would do it and then forgets. Lately I've been feeling very upset about this and the relationship in general and I said that I do not care at this point and that he could apply for jobs that would requiere working locally, which would also requiere for us to move to a bigger city where you can find a job much easier. I can admit that I have grown more distant because the lack of motivation/what not really bothers me. Obviously, I have lost any hope for the initial plan because it looks it's going nowhere. I then started to look at some apartments and agreed with the landlords to go check them out. I informed my parents (we have been staying there since mid-summer) about this and I did say that the reason for us moving was so he could just apply for more jobs there. He got upset at me because I made it look like the moving away  part is only because of him and said that if that is the only reason for us to move, he won't come with me to see check these places out.

He's had half a year to get off his ass and get a job but he hasn't. He's comfortable and happy not working and living off someone else. He sounds 17, not 27.\n\nDon't rent a place with this guy. You'll only end up paying for every single little thing and if you fall behind on bills, it would effect your credit rating.", "NTA. Do not support a freeloader", "NTA.  Move without him if necessary.", "NTA. It's time to tell him to leave.  It's over. You seem over it at this point. I am too.", "NTA but why are you still with him? How is he supporting himself and how do you expect to have a life with someone that doesn\u2019t care about being employed? What exactly is he doing with his time?", "I get that job hunting stinks and becomes demoralizing when you can't find your ideal job. \n\nHowever, at some point your bf needed to suck it up and just get a job that pays something instead of mooching off you and your parents. \n\nWanting your significant other to have gainful employment is perfectly normal.\n\nNTA here.", "NTA - it sounds like your bf has lost motivation to work/look for work. You're trying to be as accommodating as possible, but what if you do move and he still doesn't find work? Then you're financially on the hook and supporting his lifestyle.\n\nI'd have a very honest conversation about the relationship because it seems like you're both in very different places. Otherwise pack your backs and go travel!", "NTA and I wish I could warn more people at your young age to RUN, this isn't going to get better. He's gotten comfortable and that's not a good sign.", "ETA: NTA.  For reasons stated below, OP and BF are just incompatible and need to call it quits.\n\nOriginal question:  Am I understanding this?  You're living with your parents, now you're trying to get an apartment in an area with more job possibilities and your BF is refusing to come with you? Is he planning on staying with your parents?", "NTA, but I think you should go with your work and travel abroad plan and leave the unmotivated, leeching bf behind to sort out his own issues. Stop supporting him. You'll feel so much freer and lighter without dead weight dragging you down.  \n\nWhy would you want to get an apartment in a place you don't even necessarily want to live just so you can continue to support your ungracious, unnecessary dependent?", "NTA. Read room, he will a mooch for as long as you let him. Take the trash out already, you're prolonging unnecessary pain.", "NTA... it sounds like you are both living with your parents? It's time to move out ON YOUR OWN!!!! No boyfriend.  \nIF and WHEN he gets a stable job on his own, he may be old enough to be in a relationship.  \nYou'd be inconceivably stupid to continue supporting someone that has no feelings for you. Simply put, you are convenient, his mommy replacement. A real man is a partner that works with you not against you. Smarten up! Wake up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This does not sound like a healthy relationship. Maybe you can become a digital nomad and travel without him.", "NTA you're both still young. Unless you're willing to do this managerial stuff for the rest of your life while getting increasingly frustrated, I suggest you call it quits. He sounds like he needs space to grow and not to be managed (even if that means his situation becomes worse, some people hate their partner getting involved like this and it ends up being counter productive by making them more dependent) and you could do with all that energy back.", "We shared all expenses before (when he was working) so if he does find a job, I know he would pay his part. But, when he lost his previous job, I was not prepared that 1. it would took this long 2. his lack of motivation.", "Ditto", "Honestly right now I am not feeling much.\nHe basically has no expenses at this point.\nHe has helped around with some stuff both at his parents and mine, but I'd say he spends most of his free time gaming.", "I got very upset of his reaction and told him that he can just leave tomorrow and go live with his parents. I also asked what is his plan if we do not move or if we break up and he has to live alone at his parents house.

It's been months, he could have found something by now. He doesn't have the motivation like you just said.", "He's showing you that he's already decided to not work. Actions speak louder than words. You should definitely move on with your life and be happy", "Gaming... yup, I have seen this addiction ruin marriages. Repeatedly.  This is avoidance.... understand that this won't get better. Let him do this at his parents place.", "I would have bet on that, time to find an adult.", "I mean, how much clearer can he make it to you:\n\n* he has NO intention of looking for a job\n* he has NO intention of traveling the world with you\n* he has NO intention of even moving out of your parents' house.\n\nHis entire goal is to maintain the status quo of your current living arrangement. By contrast, your entire goal is to do anything BUT maintain the status quo.  Regardless of who is in the right about the job issue (it's you), you're just not compatible anymore. Don't get that new apartment.  Call it quits and begin your travels solo. You'll find someone along the way who shares your ambition and sense of adventure.", "I second this. Until he's stable just don't get a place with him. You'll grow to resent him more and more the longer this goes on."]}
