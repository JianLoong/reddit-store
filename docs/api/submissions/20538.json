My Father (48) was never present in my early life as he and my mother divorced when I was very young and he moved 6 hours away for work. but eventually we rekindled and were on good terms in my mid teens, once I graduated my father asked if I would like to come and live with him, My Step Mother (28) and my older sister (24) to make up for the fact that I never really had the chance to see him growing up.\n\nI was hesitant as I had landed a very high paying job straight out of school and was also planning on moving in with a few friends. My older sister had been living with them since she was 19 and said she'd like to have me around, so I caved and just after my 19th birthday I quit my job, cancelled my plans to move away with my friends and packed all my stuff into my car. to be honest it was great living with him but I struggled settling into the new town (making friends, getting a job, etc.)\n\nFast forward to two weeks ago and I've found a job, have made friends and am dirt poor because I've spent all my money on a trip to Spain with said friends. Four days before I leave my sister suddenly moves out as one of her friends' roommates moved away so she very quickly in the space of a few days moved in with her friend, all good. I go on my trip for two weeks and came back three days ago as of writing this post.\n\nThe first day I was back my Father and Stepmother were very nice and welcoming, picking me up from the airport, asking how it all went, wanting to see pictures but after having dinner they said that they wanted to talk to me about something serious. They sat me down and explained that while they really like having me around, they loved having their own space and house to themselves more, and that they wanted me out in three weeks, they said they'd help me move my stuff and that id always be allowed to stop by. I was shocked and very hurt, I brought up that *they* wanted me to move in with them and that my older sister had been living with them the last 4-5 years. We went back and forth for about an hour arguing until I reached a boiling point, I just started shouting and told them how hurt I was, how it was bullshit that I moved away from home and lost a great job and opportunity just for this. My step mother said that I was too old to be living with them anyways and that I was acting like a leech (I pay them rent and buy my own food) and so I told her that was ironic coming from a gold digger.\n\nAfter that they told me to pack my things and leave and that I wasn't welcome back, which I did. I'm now staying with my sister until I can find somewhere to stay, they haven't talked to me since and my sister agrees that it was messed up for them to do. I get you eventually have to move out of home but inviting me to live with you when I'm doing well and then kicking me out when I'm broke feels like such a betrayal to me, so AITA for how I reacted?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: sorry I wasn't clear, I've lived with them a year, they didn't kick me out as soon as I moved in. happy to answer any other questions or miscommunications.", "created_utc": 1687687647, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14iikl2/aita_for_shouting_at_my_father_and_calling_my/", "score": 676, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's are reason why your sister just moved out and then right after that they tell you to get out in 3 weeks.", "Life school is expensive...\n\nBut damn, you really pulled a short straw.\n\nNTA\n\nAt least you know who you are dealing with...", "NTA. They insisted you live with them, you accommodated them at your own expense, and then they changed their mind and ask you to move out in the most inconvenient moment. And they give you only 3 weeks to move out!!", "YTA \n\nYou were not thinking with long term benefit in mind when you ditched a great job to go live with your dad. You should not have done that. You need to own that decision. They didn't make you drop it, you and only you chose to do so. Stop blaming them for your decision.\n\n I also see little which suggests your stepmom is a gold digger, so that was just you being nasty, and explains why they are not willing to speak with you now or allow you back.\n\nI'm guessing they initially offered to house you without knowing you had a great opportunity and living situation already lined up, thinking you were a young person they could help get on her feet. They likely intended it to be short term until you got sorted. \n\nThen they experienced the empty nest after your sister moved out and you were away and it was wonderful. To them, it seems you HAVE gotten sorted. You've gotten a job, friends, and become established. You've gotten built up enough to go on expensive vacations. You seem ready. \n\nSo it's not that insane that they think you're ready to fly solo, and gave you a full month to find a new place, which they offered to help you with.", "NTA. What they did was horrible. You upended your life at his request and he is unending it all over again, just a year later. He is making horrible decisions and I'm so sorry.", "NTA guess you know how your Mum felt, your Dad and his wife are essentially completely selfish. Hopefully you can move forward and get back to having a good future with people who care about you.", "EACTLY.", "> ... a very high paying job straight out of school [snip] I quit my job, cancelled my plans to move away with my friends\n\nNTA - I guess you must have been desperate to connect with your father. I can't think of another good reason to quit a good job and move like that. I'm sorry your dad revealed that he was still an ass. I hope you taking this risky move doesn't financially ruin you for long.", "Another important thing, if your dad sends any of his family members to talk to you, express regret to you, block them as well.", "I would never speak to them again, that's totally unforgivable.", "It would not be a bad idea to go absolutely NC on them, if only to let your father feel uncomfortable with what he has done.", "NTA your dad is a lousy father & is an absolute creep for being involved with a woman young enough to be his daughter.", "But I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve shared any info here that makes us able to judge if \u201cgolddigger\u201d would be a fair assessment of your father\u2019s partner.", "In time, he will reach out to you, and you can decide then how you want to handle it.", "I also think they were wrong (though not necessarily an asshole) for only giving you three weeks,,", "In 10 years time step-mom will be too old for her \u2018daddy\u2019 and will find an even younger girl to be wife number 3. They wont last long, at worse it will be another 15-20 years before the dad becomes elderly and she ditches him with his money.", "Further incidents may result in a ban..", "All the way around, the dad sounds like a loser and an asshole", "Further incidents may result in a ban..", "What sort of an idiot are you? Quit a good job, just to move in with a deadbeat dad and his gold digger? This was a wake up call for you. Take it, move on, get a good job and cut them out of your life. NTA in this situation, but YTA for what you are doing to yourself.", "I'm not an expert on the matter, but that may be worth speaking to an attorney. It  sounds a lot like this situation turned into an illegal eviction. A consultation would be free and you would possibly be eligible for legal aid if a lawyer wouldn't take the case on a consignment basis where they would only collect money out of winnings and get nothing if you lose.", "NTA---Except for the gold digger remark...", "You changed your entire life for them, and then they pulled the rug from under you\n\nDefinitely NTA for reacting the way you did. Golddigger stepmother has no right to dictate what happens between you and your father", "I quit my job,,,", "Is.", "It's always worth letting the previous employer know you'd be interested in coming back. Even if they don't have something for you right now, they can keep you in mind for new openings. Personally, I would always prefer to re-hire someone I know was a good fit for a job.", "This is a bot comment.", "Bad bot", "Bad bot", "Can you explain? I don't understand why", "Do you? Do you mind explaining for the rest of us?", "NTA then.", "My dad and his partner invited me to live with them. A few weeks later she kicked me out because, well she was an alcoholic taking a lot of morphine so emotional stability wasn't her strong point.\n\nBeen 8 years, haven't spoke a word to my Dad since, I won't even go to his funeral when he dies.", "How original. Lol.", "I think the gold digger remark was the subject of this AITA.", "It was well earned.", "Being on the receiving end of a similar story - might not be it. Might be that they suddenly realized OP is a person with different life things going on and not an accessory.", "He never mentioned anything about it."]}
