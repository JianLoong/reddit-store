My Father (48) was never present in my early life as he and my mother divorced when I was very young and he moved 6 hours away for work. but eventually we rekindled and were on good terms in my mid teens, once I graduated my father asked if I would like to come and live with him, My Step Mother (28) and my older sister (24) to make up for the fact that I never really had the chance to see him growing up.\n\nI was hesitant as I had landed a very high paying job straight out of school and was also planning on moving in with a few friends. My older sister had been living with them since she was 19 and said she'd like to have me around, so I caved and just after my 19th birthday I quit my job, cancelled my plans to move away with my friends and packed all my stuff into my car. to be honest it was great living with him but I struggled settling into the new town (making friends, getting a job, etc.)\n\nFast forward to two weeks ago and I've found a job, have made friends and am dirt poor because I've spent all my money on a trip to Spain with said friends. Four days before I leave my sister suddenly moves out as one of her friends' roommates moved away so she very quickly in the space of a few days moved in with her friend, all good. I go on my trip for two weeks and came back three days ago as of writing this post.\n\nThe first day I was back my Father and Stepmother were very nice and welcoming, picking me up from the airport, asking how it all went, wanting to see pictures but after having dinner they said that they wanted to talk to me about something serious. They sat me down and explained that while they really like having me around, they loved having their own space and house to themselves more, and that they wanted me out in three weeks, they said they'd help me move my stuff and that id always be allowed to stop by. I was shocked and very hurt, I brought up that *they* wanted me to move in with them and that my older sister had been living with them the last 4-5 years. We went back and forth for about an hour arguing until I reached a boiling point, I just started shouting and told them how hurt I was, how it was bullshit that I moved away from home and lost a great job and opportunity just for this. My step mother said that I was too old to be living with them anyways and that I was acting like a leech (I pay them rent and buy my own food) and so I told her that was ironic coming from a gold digger.\n\nAfter that they told me to pack my things and leave and that I wasn't welcome back, which I did. I'm now staying with my sister until I can find somewhere to stay, they haven't talked to me since and my sister agrees that it was messed up for them to do. I get you eventually have to move out of home but inviting me to live with you when I'm doing well and then kicking me out when I'm broke feels like such a betrayal to me, so AITA for how I reacted?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: sorry I wasn't clear, I've lived with them a year, they didn't kick me out as soon as I moved in. happy to answer any other questions or miscommunications.", "created_utc": 1687687647, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14iikl2/aita_for_shouting_at_my_father_and_calling_my/", "score": 1174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
