My Father (48) was never present in my early life as he and my mother divorced when I was very young and he moved 6 hours away for work. but eventually we rekindled and were on good terms in my mid teens, once I graduated my father asked if I would like to come and live with him, My Step Mother (28) and my older sister (24) to make up for the fact that I never really had the chance to see him growing up.\n\nI was hesitant as I had landed a very high paying job straight out of school and was also planning on moving in with a few friends. My older sister had been living with them since she was 19 and said she'd like to have me around, so I caved and just after my 19th birthday I quit my job, cancelled my plans to move away with my friends and packed all my stuff into my car. to be honest it was great living with him but I struggled settling into the new town (making friends, getting a job, etc.)\n\nFast forward to two weeks ago and I've found a job, have made friends and am dirt poor because I've spent all my money on a trip to Spain with said friends. Four days before I leave my sister suddenly moves out as one of her friends' roommates moved away so she very quickly in the space of a few days moved in with her friend, all good. I go on my trip for two weeks and came back three days ago as of writing this post.\n\nThe first day I was back my Father and Stepmother were very nice and welcoming, picking me up from the airport, asking how it all went, wanting to see pictures but after having dinner they said that they wanted to talk to me about something serious. They sat me down and explained that while they really like having me around, they loved having their own space and house to themselves more, and that they wanted me out in three weeks, they said they'd help me move my stuff and that id always be allowed to stop by. I was shocked and very hurt, I brought up that *they* wanted me to move in with them and that my older sister had been living with them the last 4-5 years. We went back and forth for about an hour arguing until I reached a boiling point, I just started shouting and told them how hurt I was, how it was bullshit that I moved away from home and lost a great job and opportunity just for this. My step mother said that I was too old to be living with them anyways and that I was acting like a leech (I pay them rent and buy my own food) and so I told her that was ironic coming from a gold digger.\n\nAfter that they told me to pack my things and leave and that I wasn't welcome back, which I did. I'm now staying with my sister until I can find somewhere to stay, they haven't talked to me since and my sister agrees that it was messed up for them to do. I get you eventually have to move out of home but inviting me to live with you when I'm doing well and then kicking me out when I'm broke feels like such a betrayal to me, so AITA for how I reacted?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: sorry I wasn't clear, I've lived with them a year, they didn't kick me out as soon as I moved in. happy to answer any other questions or miscommunications.", "created_utc": 1687687647, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14iikl2/aita_for_shouting_at_my_father_and_calling_my/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Were things always bad?", "NTA\n\nIt's understandable that you feel hurt and betrayed by your father and stepmother's decision to ask you to move out after you made significant life changes to live with them. However, the way you reacted by shouting and making hurtful comments, such as calling your stepmother a gold digger, may not have been the most constructive way to express your feelings.\n\nIt would have been more productive to have a respectful conversation with your father and stepmother about how their decision made you feel and to try to understand their perspective as well. It's important to express your emotions, but also to listen to their reasoning and expectations.\n\nThat being said, their decision to ask you to leave after a year of living with them does not necessarily make you the asshole in this situation. The circumstances are complex, and it seems there may have been a lack of clear communication and understanding from both sides.\n\nMoving forward, it may be helpful to have a calm discussion with your father and stepmother to address your concerns and find a resolution that works for everyone involved.", "[removed]", "ESH.

I may be way off target but, as your stepmum is only 4 years older than your sister, she may not have been as keen as your dad in having you live there anyway.\nI'm sorry this has happened and while you shouldn't have called her a gold digger, we all say things in the heat of the moment. You gave up the chance at a high paying job, left friends and other family by moving 6 hours away so he could play 'happy families' and, the novelty seems to have worn off.\nYou were paying your way so not a leech and NTA. \nHonestly, your dad is the AH and your step mum is no better.

As an adult, you don't get to keep living with people in their home if those people decide they don't want you to live with them. Regardless of how long they lived with whoever. You never signed an agreement with your parents about how long you'll live with them, did you? They didn't force you to move in with them, did they? From the circumstances, it sounds like you had every reason to move and very little to stay but you made that decision with no plan about the day when that would end. Did you think your parents would never change their mind? Did you think they didn't have the right to change their mind? Because all of that is very immature thinking. \n\nYour step mother was clearly wrong/an asshole for calling you a leech after inviting you to stay. I also think they were wrong (though not necessarily an asshole) for only giving you three weeks. That's not much time to build up enough of a lump sum to get another place. But you were clearly wrong/an asshole for calling her a golddigger. And, in my opinion, you're wrong (though not necessarily an asshole) for blaming your circumstances on anyone but yourself.  You made the choice to live with your parents, giving up a LOT, without any guarantee, and you're old enough to deal with the consequences of not planning your living circumstances very well. \n\nFrankly, your sister is irrelevant unless this is some consistent and long standing favoritism on your parents' part. Firstly, not all kids need the same thing. Secondly, your parents' needs also have to be addressed. And, it sounds like your parents need time to themselves. \n\nI hope this can be a lesson to you to not leave your living circumstances up to chance or the whims of other people.", "ESH You learned a valuable lesson.
