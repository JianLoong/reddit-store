My step mother said that I was too old to be living with them anyways and that I was acting like a leech (I pay them rent and buy my own food) and so I told her that was ironic coming from a gold digger.\n\nAfter that they told me to pack my things and leave and that I wasn't welcome back, which I did. I'm now staying with my sister until I can find somewhere to stay, they haven't talked to me since and my sister agrees that it was messed up for them to do.
