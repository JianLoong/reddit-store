He asked me if I would help him make an appointment and drive him there and of course I agreed. I think he needed to hear some perspectives from real people rather than stuff from google. He cried and apologized and explained that it took everything in him just to go to the store today. But he actually agreed to go and I\u2019m so glad. He said he just really needs help getting it all set up for him. He told me he has been so stressed and he is getting to a point where he\u2019s not functional. He slept 17 hours today so I definitely agree. I told him that the cpap machines aren\u2019t what they used to be and he said he really didn\u2019t care anymore he just wants to feel better and not to worry. \n\n*finally figured out how to edit, editing because I mistyped my age and to clarify the age of the baby in case it matters* I (24 F) am constantly arguing with my husband (35 M) because he will not go to the doctor for his sleep apnea. It\u2019s so fucking bad. We have a baby (2 months) and his chainsaw snoring is constantly waking her and I both up. She\u2019s exclusively breastfed and every time she wakes up, she wants to eat so I\u2019m stuck with it. Him sleeping in the other room does nothing because it\u2019s that loud. I keep begging him to go to the doctor and he refuses because he doesn\u2019t want a cpap machine. He keeps getting mad because I wont get off the subject and I\u2019ve explained to him that I\u2019m going to be in a perpetually pissy mood until I can get a good nights sleep. I told him that it\u2019s ridiculous I have to deal with it with no choice when he has a choice and just doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to be darth vader\u201d in his words. So I yelled at him and I told him that snoring is the 3rd leading cause of divorce to which he replied, \u201cGreat. More statistics.\u201d And I told him it\u2019s incredibly selfish, not to mention dangerous and he has a baby to be healthy for now. He pouted for like 10 minutes and then fell asleep - again.

Protect yourself and your child.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who suffers from sleep apnea, I was wary about the cpap machine at first, but it is genuinely life changing. \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, sleep apnea is not just snoring, it is points where your body stops breathing for a period of time, and then draws a huge breath, which triggers the incredibly loud snore. Because of this you never really get to a proper deep sleep, instead only getting a nap-like sleep (no matter how much you are \u201casleep\u201d for).\n\nAfter just one night using my machine I could instantly tell the difference in how I felt rested. For those who don\u2019t suffer, imagine how it feels to have a good night sleep after several days of being disturbed while sleeping, but scaled up a hundredfold.", "No NTA at all, yell at him some more, sleep apnea can kill him.", "I started using a CPAP close to 20 years ago. They are so much better now! Smaller, quieter, with heated tubing that helps reduce/eliminate condensation and phone apps so you can see how you're doing. Also, if the first mask he tries isn't comfortable (after giving it at least a few weeks to get used to it), he needs to try another one or another type. There are masks that cover both the nose and mouth, others cover only the nose, a third type is called nasal pillows and cover just each nostril. They do not go way into the nose like cannula for oxygen. I knew I couldn't handle the first type, tried the second and did okay for awhile but started having trouble with the \"seal\" breaking and air shooting into my eye (not pleasant!). Tried the pillows and they're great. I can hardly feel them & quickly forget about them. I use a wedge pillow to elevate my head and shoulders, which also seems to help. They are a bit pricey, but worth it imo. My apnea is very bad, last sleep study showed I stopped breathing two times a MINUTE. I've never had an episode where I completely stopped and had to be resuscitated. Make sure you mention that when setting up the appointment! There can be pretty long waits for a sleep specialist. If they know he nearly died, that might get him in faster.", "NTA. I have a CPAP and the first one I got back in the late 1990's was awful. It was loud and kept waking me up. I returned it after 30 days and dealt with the sleep apnea for another 10 years. I had sleep apnea as a child and just dealt with it all those years. My snoring was freight train level and woke people up even on a different level of the house.  Doctor had me go back to a sleep study (overnight) around 2010 and the new machines were a god-send. Best sleep I've ever had and now I can't sleep without one. He will need to find head-gear that works for him but he will be happy when he is finally getting good sleep and so will you and the baby. Good luck!  Oh, and I dream now. Never had dreams as a child as my body never got to REM.  He will love it and love you more for nagging him to get it.", "I did this to my husband and it was freaking hilarious. He couldn't believe he was that loud.", "Fr and the fact that in the update he made HIS need for a doctors appointment her responsibility. This man is a predator.", "Resist the urge.  We have a baby to think about.", "No, tbh he\u2019s actually a really good and fair partner otherwise. It has just recently gotten hard for him with this specific issue.", "Get a small fan to point at his face. It worked for me.", "Tell him sleep apnea leads to ED and dementia and kills brain cells.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCpaps are awesome.", "Happened to my husband's cousin as well. I can't imagine waking up to find my husband had passed away. Trauma for sure.", "ah OK then.......perhaps 2mo would be better than 2m?  The usual shorthand is 35f, or 2m....... LOL", "The first CPAP Machine was (not sure if this is correct language) continuous flow.   The pressure was so high that I felt like it was suffocating me.  I would have panic attacks and couldn't sleep with it.  So I ended up not using it.    \nDuring the delightful heyday of the pandemic, I had another sleep study(apnea much worse at this point), Got a new machine, this one has Pulse mode(as in cycles with breathing).  No panic attacks(I don't even need to use the ramping up option).  \n\nI personally was not able to use a full face mask(tried nose pillows--they worked but weren't comfortable). I have a nose mask that works pretty great.  It's important to both get a good fitting mask(and a style that works for husband).\n\nIt is a good thing you took a hardline.  Falling asleep while driving is a THING with sleep apnea.  Falling asleep sitting down(even standing up) can happen.  The dangers of sleeping at the wrong time is bad enough, but the brain fog from lack of oxygen does accumulate.", "NTA\u2026 I am the same age as your husband and I have to use one. I can understand the exhaustion because not getting a good nights sleep really affects how you operate during the day. I had a vicious cycle where I ate to gain energy, but that lead to tremendous weight gain. It wasn\u2019t until I got a CPAP that I could start to control my weight.", "There are possible alternatives to cpap machines. Someone I know uses an EMA (Elastic Mandibular Advancement) dental device. It moves the jaw forward so the airway is opened. He doesn't find it uncomfortable and he notices that he has more energy after sleeping. Here's a research study comparing cpap to EMA. [Long-Term Effectiveness of Oral Appliance versus CPAP Therapy and the Emerging Importance of Understanding Patient Preferences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3738032/)", "Honey he married someone much younger to be in control, not to have you tell him what to do. Creepy.", "No? 40 weeks for the pregnancy, and baby is 2 months old, she was around 23 when she got pregnant?", "I have a normal size everything else and a weirdly tiny throat. It sucks. I love my CPAP though. I also have TERRIBLE allergies and it means I can breathe fine when I'm trying to sleep no matter what a shitshow my allergies are.", "I wrote this when it still said she was 22.", "Oh, I was replying regarding your edit, which says 21", "Yes, because the post initially said she is 22, which would have meant she was almost certainly 21 when she conceived. But that no longer applies.", "My dad was your husband, only 20 years older. He kept falling asleep while having a meal, while talking, and worst of all, while driving. I had been in the car with him where I had to keep shaking him awake. It was terrifying. He vehemently refused even the idea of a cpap because he viewed it as an admission of being somehow handicap and disabled. He spent many years in this denial, and our family are forever grateful that nothing horrible happened. He did get into a car accident once but it was just a fender-bender where they didn't even exchange insurance because the cars had no visible damage.\nIt took a casual conversation with a man he works with and respects. That man mentioned to him he'd been sleeping with a cpap for many years and he swears by it, and it's improved his quality of life a lot. He gave him his spare machine for a few nights to try. He tried it and bought one of his own like 2 days later. He has used it every night since then. He says he deeply regrets not getting it much sooner and putting himself through hell for years. My mom jokes the cpap is his mistress. I don't know what you mean by they are not what they used to be, but this is a very recent story of a cpap chaging a man's life.", "Me getting a CPAP was the second best thing to improve my sleeping since my husband got his CPAP. I kick myself for not doing it years earlier. NTA and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s been convinced!", "Lol. Now she's 24 cuz she mistyped her age. Which mayb she did but idk, doesn't everyone know how reddit feels about age gap relationships especially the ones that involve kids. I would definitely not b making typos that made my husband look like predator.", "How do you people do the math? Even of the child was 2 years old (2yo is a toddler, not a baby, but whatev), and OP is 24, she would have to be 21 when she got pregnant. Where is 19/20 coming from? Did OP edit her own age too?", "OP, you don't seem to be taking it dead seriously that your husband is ill. Especially considering he's already had a near-death experience. Like someone else said, you are focusing on baby waking up and you being in a pissy mood from sleep deprivation, rather than the fact that your husband's life may end very abruptly any night. People are making dumb jokes and you are having a good laugh. I hope this gets fixed before it's too late and you end up with a lot of regret for life. This is not a laughing matter. He is not taking it seriously because some men can be stupid like that with their machismo, but if you love him and want him around, you have to smarten up and realize this is not when you make hee-hee on reddit.", "OP, believe me your husband is not getting rest while sleeping like that. His brain is deprived with oxygen and he is struggling to stay alive every minute you think he is restfully asleep but just snores loud. Please do not take the above petty advice. Find another way to convince him to save his own life.", "You have no idea how debilitating a severe case of sleep apnea can be. My dad had trouble staying awake with a fork with food in his hand. Please don't judge OP's husband for needing help from his partner to organize his recovery for him. Would you do that if he had any other illness that made him handicap? Well the handicap is very real. Be glad you've never witnessed it or a case so severe.", "Yes, she did. In the original, unedited post, she listed her age as 22. If you\u2019d bothered to read her edit, you\u2019d know that.", "I hear you, and I am absolutely doing everything I can to get him the help he needs. I do 1000000000% understand that it\u2019s a life or death situation. However, I don\u2019t need permission to cope with the immense amounts of trauma through humor and I am also allowed to consider my own health and the health of my two month old simultaneously. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a laugh after weeks of dealing with the constant terror that I\u2019m going to lose my husband. Everyone copes differently.", "My friend\u2019s dad worked in radiochemistry and fell asleep at the bench long enough for his sample to decay to uselessness, that\u2019s when he knew he needed to get checked out.", "I love when people give sarcastic condoscending replies to simple questions. Peace out, fellow human.", "Ok. As long as you understand how serious it is. Just wanted to make sure because I've seen it first hand. Please don't take some of the suggestions on here about waking him up, blaring a horn or whatever. He is ill and pulling something like that may have very sad consequences. I hope you guys see a doctor asap. Looks like he has agreed. Best of luck and health to your family.", "Dayum. I was a snoring sob, but that sounds awful. I have apnea for like 17 years because of my father's snoring. Recently (two-three years ago) i halfway managed to reduce it by myself and now i just snore a few times a month. It really helps to get rid of it, by all means. \n\nYou're nta and some need tough comments. Your hubby needs to know that no matter how young they are, all will bite you back", "In addition to other comments, he should not drive.
