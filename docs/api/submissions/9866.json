{"id": 9866, "submission_id": "1118lqn", "title": "AITA for not giving my son my car to pay off his debt?", "selftext": "Let\u2019s start from the very beginning. Over 20 years ago I divorced from my then wife. I had two kids with her; my oldest son and my youngest daughter. I always had a very good relationship with my son. He was my one and only. \n\nAt age seventeen, my son moved in with me and my girlfriend. I always tried to get my daughter to move in, too, but she refused. I tried to make it nice for us. But soon I realized that having another mouth to feed was emptying my bank account faster than I could see. I soon jumped from workplace to workplace and asked all my friends for money, which I barely was able to pay back.\n\nSo I started asking my son for money. He paid for groceries here and there over the years, then he helped me with some bills and even got a credit card on his name for us to use, since I couldn\u2019t get one due to my debt. \nIt went well for a bunch of years. But still, my money was always on the low. I forgot to pay my car insurance for a few months and they ended my contract. So, I created a new one with my son\u2019s name on it. I asked him of course, as always, so he always knew what he was getting himself into. \n\nSoon, he moved out and moved in with his girlfriend. She was a very nice girl. Or so I thought.\n\nHe soon asked me to pay him back some money, since he now had some credit card debt. He did the math and it summed up to around $10,000. I really didn\u2019t have that kind of money and he knew that. He soon went no contact.\n\nHe visited me and we talked normally for some time. Then he started asking me for my car; he asked me if I could give him my car, so he could sell it to pay off his debts. I told him no, immediately. I needed the car for my new job, since it was in the neighboring city. He told me to take the train and bus and that there were cheap tickets any my job could help me get a permanent ticket. I told him that I couldn\u2019t do that.\n\nThat was at the end of 2021. I told him if I didn\u2019t have the money for his debt until January of 2022, he could have the car. After that conversation, he went no contact. \n\nJanuary came and I didn\u2019t have the money. I really couldn\u2019t bring it up and I told him that. He asked about my promise and the car, but I know I didn\u2019t promise him anything. I told him I still need the car. We had a long fight over the phone in which his girlfriend said, that a loving father wouldn\u2019t do something like that to his son, with which she meant all the money I \"took\" from him. And with that statement, she was dead to me.\n\nI got diagnosed with depression due to the situation. I do regret my mistakes but I think he made me suffer enough. I miss my son but until he apologizes for treating me like this, I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with him either. I feel so torn. My daughter isn\u2019t there for me either.\nAITA?\n\nTldr: I refused to give my son my car to pay off his debt, blaming me for everything, even though he always knew what he\u2019s getting himself into and now doesn\u2019t talk to me.

Not only did you affect his ability to spend or save as he wishes before, but your actions are continuing to cost him every month as the debt you piled on his shoulder continues to hang around his neck as you do absolutely nothing to help him out from underneath it. \nThat debt is now sitting there affecting his financial security, and causing knock on effects if he wanted to get a car loan, a mortgage or any other financial dealings that all comes with a warning to any lender of 'already owes money for an existing loan, be careful about giving him any more.'\n\nEvery month he has to find a way to pay his own way in life, while also still having to pay out for the expenses you accumulated before. \n\nAnd then to pile on a little more, you made an agreement with him to sell you car and clear the decks, then just decided you couldn't be bothered because you still hadn't been able to save up enough.
