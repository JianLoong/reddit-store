Like everyone these days we are struggling financially. Unfortunately, this week my husbands job is cutting peoples hours to part time. He mentioned this a week ago and I told him we would be in trouble if that happens. He kept saying he wants to find a new job. Well today he asked me \u201cso when are u going to start looking for jobs\u201d I was confused and asked him what he meant. He said that he wanted me to get online and look for jobs for him. This made me mad. I figured I would apply for the first few for him because I know he\u2019s not very good at things like that but I totally did not expect him to expect me to find jobs AND apply for them. He has previously mentioned that he should apply for ton of them. I expressed this to him and he got upset. He said \u201cI\u2019ve been at the same job for 8 years I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing\u201d and threw it it my face that I have had 6 jobs. We pay 50/50 on bills and each time I have switched jobs he has NEVER had to cover the bills by himself. and he actually said to me \u201cyou don\u2019t understand, when my hours get cut there are bills that are not going to get paid\u201d. I just picture my whole Saturday sitting by him and job searching as well as filling out dozens of applications while he sits next to me and plays video games. He claims he\u2019s doing the hard part because he has to interview.

Are you his mother or his wife?", "NTA\n\nShould you help him when he needs it, even without asking? Yeah relationships are like that, and being nice and helpful is a great trait to have. HOWEVER, should he expect this by default, to the point he cannot take care of himself? **Hell no**.\n\nHe needs to put his big boy pants on, and get to fucking work finding work. Jobs don't find themselves. How fucking entitled do you need to be, to say that the interview is stressful enough, so you can't make a resume and send it out. Fuck me.", "NTA and also wtf he is a grown man, he can look for and apply to jobs himself.\n\nok: asking you to read over a cover letter/look at his cv THAT HE WROTE, FOR JOBS HE FOUND, to make sure there's no egregious mistakes before he submits then\n\nnot ok: expecting you to do all the looking for/applying/etc bc he has to do the interview, that's batshit", "NTA 100% weaponized incompetence", "NTA. He's a grown ass man. The blatant disrespect of him just EXPECTING you to find and apply for jobs for him and then getting pissed that you won't is childish and unacceptable.\n\nThe fact that he didn't even bother to ASK, \"hey, would you mind helping me fill out some job applications?\"........\n\nHe's behaving like a spoiled child. Maybe it's just because I'm older and have no tolerance anymore for such willful ignorance, but I would DEFINITELY NOT search or apply for jobs for him unless he asked me super nicely and actually helped to the best of his ability. If he gets pissed again about how you won't just do it for him while he sits on his butt and doesn't contribute, I'd seriously start considering divorce on the grounds that you weren't aware you were marrying a toddler.", "NTA. And just wow. What a manipulative prick move on his part. Totally made it your fault if bills don't get paid because YOU didn't find HIM a new job . Surely this man has used manipulative tactics on you before now.", "He\u2019s the one with the time on his hands!! NTA!!", "NTA but you shouldn\u2019t have filled out any applications for him. Weaponized incompetence at it\u2019s finest. \n\nHe\u2019s the AH for throwing your job history at you like that. Ask him to list the specific bills that won\u2019t get paid due to this change. If he can\u2019t there\u2019s your answer.", "I had to do this for my ex husband. It was incredibly frustrating that I was paying all of the bills and he was pretending to try and find a job. I even got him an interview and pretended to be him in emails with the guy who ultimately hired him. You\u2019re NTA, tell him to get his shit together or leave.", "Big NTA and it's no surprise his hours are on the chopping block. I can't imagine he's a great employee.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s a big boy & can look for jobs himself.", "NTA.  Great example of weaponized incompetence.  As shocking as it may be employers expect job candidates to search and apply for jobs themselves.  Learning their wife did it is very off putting.  Maybe offer to read over his resume and show him how to find sites/companies to search.  But don't baby him.  He can learn this.  Also has he checked if reducing his hours qualifies him for partial unemployment?  Will your reduced income qualify him for any type of assistance?  I know a lot of people don't like to use assistance, but your situation is what it's for.  To help bridge the gap when your financial situation changes.", "NTA Ask him where is his self respect it? He is the one who needs the job and it is up to him to do what ever other adult do to get one. This is not your responsibility. I would flat out tell him absolutely NOT especially with his attitude. You\u2019ve had 6 jobs so what! You earned your pay and you are employed so what\u2019s that crack about? Just tell him if it gets to the point where we have to sell things to meet your bills the first things to go will be the gaming console and anything else that takes his attention away from finding work. This is complete and total disrespect for you to be EXPECTED to wipe his ass!", "NTA. He should be embarrassed by his statement. You are not his manager, minder or mommy. He\u2019s a grown up with fully functioning mind and body. \n\nIf he wanted too. He would.", "Lol\n\nNTA\n\nHe is perfectly capable of finding his own job.", "He has been at the same job for 8 years. Honestly a lot about applying for jobs has changed online in that time.  He may need help and has done a shit job asking for it. \n\nSit down with him and introduce him to Indeed and other online portals. Review his resume for him. Give an hour or two and guide him. Then he is on his own.  Because he is, after all, a grown ass man.  \n\nNTA. He is leaning that way but I am trying to give him some grace since he has been at the same job since he was 19.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No distractions allowed. Next, he keeps going while you look over his shoulder while he does it himself, and then he needs to do it independently.\n\nYou know him far better then we do. I would say there is no problem helping him get through his weak areas if he has issues with staying focused or anxiety over starting or whatever. Marriage is a partnership.
