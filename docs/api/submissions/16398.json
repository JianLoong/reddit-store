I'm much more bothered by the injustice of having to show up and do the same work a man would, while I have my period making my life generally miserable.", "lmaooo YTA now", "I thought students was another name for boobs, ha.", "Yeah but you have to understand how awful and ashamed she must have felt in that moment too. Being chewed out by HR is no joke. I recently got in trouble for something ridiculous too, I would post an AITA myself but it is so specific anyone reading from my work would immediately be able to know it was me. It feels awful, and I felt awful and angry for days. And my partner's first reaction when I told him was something like \"well, you are very blunt,\" rather than (as he then said later) \"that is a ridiculous situation and I would be upset too.\" \n\nYou didn't behave perfectly because of how you felt when she was talking to you, she probably also was reacting emotionally after a very uncomfortable situation. Honestly, it's amazing how many people will match your tone if you take it down in that moment and show empathy. And tbh, this is a challenge. I have a difficult time validating people's feelings that I feel are not valid, so I really just try to focus on what I can validate in those moments. Focusing on the bs of the dress code, while still saying \"yes, the same garment does look different on me and that is likely what they're seeing, but that just shows how unfair the policy is.\"", "Dress codes still exist but they definitely differ who they apply to. When I started working at this one place, all the servers wore miniskirts etc. I was (back then lol) very skinny but curvy and conservative with what I wore. I wore skirts down to my knees, nylons, and a blazer over my shirt. While my coworkers wore mini skirts with bare legs (no hate), I got told I was dressing too provocatively.  I wore a pencil skirt with flower nylons and got shit talked all day about wearing \"fishnets\" to work, while my coworkers wore skirts up to their asses bare legged (no hate, totally management being an AH).", "I gained weight and grew boobs not so recently.  Cannot wear v necks at all anymore, sadly.  They fit totally different on different bodies.  I never used to have to pay attention to necklines and now I absolutely do.  Not anyone's fault, just an unfortunate fact of life for boobaged people.", "I don\u2019t think she was really chewed out. Our HR lady isn\u2019t the chewing out type, plus she would have said so if she did. She was just told not to wear the dress again and that was it. I hate confrontation so even that would make me upset, so I get that. Truly. I still felt like she took it out on me when it literally had nothing to do with me and she knew the rules when she chose to wear the dress. But I see what you\u2019re saying and you\u2019re right.", "At the very least, dress codes should be consistent.  But, you're right, they are not.  It sucks how people are judged and shit talked.", "Exactly. It is what it is.", "NTA - part of being a woman with a bigger bust is realising you need to take greater accommodations when dressing for the office. It sucks but it\u2019s life until you can get a reduction.\n\nSincerely someone who had to go out and buy 10 types of turtleneck after catching the CEO ogling me.", "YTA\n\nAs someone who had large breast, finding clothing is HARD. I could wear a turtleneck and they were still prevalent and seemed as if they were on display. Instead of supporting her and her being sexually harassed by HR you sided with archaic rules. I used to wear 2 sport bras, a tank top, a blouse and a sweater and I was still told that what I wore was too provocative. When I switched to men's shirts to cover up more I was told it was inappropriate as well. There's no winning when your body is an accessory.", "NTA. I\u2019m having trouble picturing a grown woman, because this argument sounds just like the one I had with my 11 year old about why the outfit she wore got her dress coded, but not her friend. \n\nPrecocious puberty is a bitch\u2026Judy Blume didn\u2019t warn me about this.", "NTA. Report her asap for harassment. This will give HR ammunition in case they want fire her and cover their back. It will also cover your back as well.", "NTA\n\nShe is upset and taking it out on the wrong person. Just keep being you. However, if she is bad mouthing you to other coworkers while at work, you might want to explain the whole thing to HR. She is harassing you because you didn\u2019t go down with the ship. Ultimately, her immaturity is making her a bad person to work with.", "NTA", "Nta. Different body shapes do lead to different clothing results in cases like these.", "It\u2019s the companies rule not yours NTA though maybe not tactful", "NTA. Clothes fit people differently. I can't count on 1 hand how many times I see a cute skirt but it looks like crap on me. If her boobs and high thighs are showing and yours aren't, that is 2 very different looks.", "NTA. She knows she shouldn\u2019t wear this dress but saw you wearing it and hoped to get around the rules\n\nI typically don\u2019t have big boobs, but am VERY well endowed when pregnant/breastfeeding. There are several things from my work wardrobe that I won\u2019t wear till they sadly disappear \ud83e\udee0", "Kinda confused, did the dress only come in one size.  You are NTA, you cannot control what HR does.", "YTA for offering your opinion. You could have just empathized over the situation.", "ESH. You for not seeing how clearly sexist your work place is. I personally think it is a problem they will get mad at her for wearing a dress you can get away with. Mainly because it proves they don\u2019t give a fuck about what clothing it is, but if they can sexualize the woman. Witch is not only insulting her, but also under-handing you. However you didn\u2019t make the dress code and it\u2019s not really your problem. She also shouldn\u2019t be taking it out on you, but more so the company.", "YTA\n\nThe dress code sounds sexist and you\u2019re siding with it.", "NTA. You are correct, it\u2019s not about the dress. It\u2019s about how the dress fits in a professional/corporate setting. It\u2019s obvious she was never really a friend if you answer her honestly and for that she trashed you to the rest of your team.", "Yeah that is really the only decent response here.", "I am a tall, \u2018blessed in the breast department\u2019 woman (though I\u2019d quibble with the use of \u2018blessed\u2019, more like \u2018uncomfortable and inconvenient\u2019 \ud83d\ude05) \n\nEvery woman in my office was wearing these very cute skintight knitted tops last year. They all looked very chic and sleek. I knew it was not for me, but a sales girl at the workwear store tried to get me to try one on. It looked like I was about to go out to a bar - with intentions. Definitely NOT chic and work appropriate. \n\nWe don\u2019t make the rules of society that say endowed=inappropriate for work, but if the rules are written down, we in the \u2018blessed\u2019 category do have to be careful. I\u2019m a big believer in loose flowy tops and midi skirts/high waisted straight leg pants for that reason.", "I\u2019m a teacher too and I\u2019m originally a k-cup. Pregnant right now and I have no idea what my size is at the present moment. And as much as I\u2019d loooove to set my girls free, I can\u2019t. My kids (I teach elementary school) are angels but they can be brutally honest.", "Yes, so do I. Camis are great for this.", "Right? Dude shows up in shorts and an A line tank with those arm holes so low you can almost see some side nipple when he reaches for the copy paper. Are we really expected to believe management is going to be like, \"Yep, Steve, you look great. The rules only apply to the women here .\"", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\u2620\ufe0f\ud83e\udd19", "GIRL. All of my sympathy for your back.", "I accidentally wore a dress that was prety conservative pre pregnancy after I went up a few cup sizes while pregnant.  I just threw it on because pants were something I wasn't willing to deal with that day, I got to school, went to the bathroom and about died. The cleavage was in your face, one male 8th grader caught me on the way to grab a jacket and said, \"Uh (obvious boob glance) you look different.\" I practically ran my way back to my room and didn't leave my house without multiple mirror checks for the rest of the year! Kids are brutal and mine weren't even close to your size. I hope you get to set them free all the time at home!!", "> fuck policing what women wear\n\nWhy only what women wear, though? Men have dress codes, too - in fact, men generally have far stricter dress codes, in that the range of things that fall within the code can be counted in one had, primarily differentiated by three colors. \n\nDress codes are a reality, why should women be an exception? Nobody wants the person at a funeral home to be in a tank top and short shorts - be it man or woman.", "Irish person living in the UK. Not a fan of their colonial bullshit but that commenter is also straight up wrong on dress codes in the UK.\n\nI\u2019m a professional stylist and personal shopper. Believe me its phrased in to 99% of workplaces re crotch and cleavage for all genders. And I\u2019ve also worked places that are the 1% that hire you to be Tits McGee to sell the shapewear or lingerie.\n\nThe Brits are almost always at it again but condidering I got my legs smacked at school and my first jobs in Ireland about skirt length, this is not the place to argue it."]}
