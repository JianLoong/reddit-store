My friend is quite busty and has MAJOR cleavage in this dress. She\u2019s also quite a bit taller than me so it\u2019s pretty short on her. \n\nShe was got pulled into HR earlier this week and was told the dress was inappropriate for work and not to wear it again. She came to me saying it\u2019s the same dress I wear and they didn\u2019t give me any grief about it so it wasn\u2019t fair. I told her I could see where they were coming from. The way I see it, it\u2019s not so much that the dress is in appropriate, it\u2019s the fact that you can see her breasts that is inappropriate, at least in the workplace. You can\u2019t see my breasts (because I don\u2019t have any) and it comes down to my knees whereas it looks like a mini dress on her. I personally would not have worn this dress to work if it fit me the way it fits her.

She\u2019s also been running around telling anyone who will listen what a bitch I am. I think it\u2019s ridiculous but some people seem to agree so, AITA?\n\nEdit: Just for clarification, the specific rules from the employee handbook are no cleavage, no skirts more than 2 inches above the knee.
