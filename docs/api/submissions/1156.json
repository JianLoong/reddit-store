We met during our first year in high school and did not loose contact when she moved schools. Me and Sara used to hang out, but recently we\u2019re both working at different times and we usually can\u2019t set up a date to meet up. She\u2019s been calling me a fake because I don\u2019t have time to spend with her and what happened on halloween made it worse. Sara had already told me that she was going to to go to another event on Saturday and I couldn\u2019t go with her because I am still underage. Things have been a little rocky between us because of certain issues i\u2019ve seen wrong and i\u2019ve been distancing myself from her to protect myself. She\u2019s the main reason why I feel insecure about how I look because she often makes jokes as \u201cit\u2019s as if to say her(me) face is so shitty\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s up ugly\u201d and at first I didn\u2019t mind but it did bring my self confidence down. She also hangs out with her bf (which he hates my guts because one time I did not say hi to him, he\u2019s the type that won\u2019t let her hang out with anyone but himself) and usually spends everyday with him, when I don\u2019t have time the one day she\u2019s not with her bf and can\u2019t hangout with her, she calls me a fake. and it has happened multiple times where sara invites me to strangers parties outside of town and leaves me alone in the crowd to be with her bf and I always have to take the bus because she won\u2019t even drive somewhere a little closer. I ignored most of these because sara is my best friend and she has been for over four years, I care for her and I have memories of her. So saturday me and a couple of other of friends decided to go celebrate halloween and we thought sara had plans so we didn\u2019t tell her anything about it, we did end up going to the club she went too (i stood outside) but we didn\u2019t call or text her to inform that we were there. We just wanted to see if the club had any specific plans for halloween. After we left, we went around town and finally made it back home late. We put stories on social media of all of us hanging out which made sara angry. She didn\u2019t answer my calls but she didn\u2019t answer the friends I was with and she just became a mean spitter person and kept on insulting me. She already had plans, we knew that she was with bf that hated all of us, and I didn\u2019t even go inside of the club. But she kept calling me and saying how fake I am for not telling her about the sleepover. The sleepover happened because I couldn\u2019t go back home at 4:00 am and we just decided to crash at my friends house, it was not planned and I was too dead tired. Sara is not understanding the situation and it holding a grudge against this, and I called her a few times to try our friendship but she rejected my calls, so I simply stopped calling her which made her more mad.

Just stop talking to her already.", "Literally... Stop trying to have her in your life. You even said it yourself how awful of a friend she is. Just bc you see her as your bsf does not mean she thinks the same. best friends dont make people feel awful about themselves nor do they ditch them in bars and parties to be with their bf. Grow up and leave her be. Give space and stop coming into any contact with her. She will continue to put you down and make everything about her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: NTA.

She feel left out because you all had fun and a sleepover and she wasn't there.  She's also mean spirited and hun friends come and go.  It's time to let this one go.  \n\nStop calling her and even block her number."]}
