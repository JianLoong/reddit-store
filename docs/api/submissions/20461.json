It's at the end of the road so we have two neighbours: one across the street and one next to us. I know them since I was 10 because the neighbours next to us are the parents of a former classmate Lilian with whom I was friends at that time. Lilian bought the house across the street a few years ago because she wanted to live near her parents. Her sister Beth (mid 30s) moved in with her parents a few months ago. Beth and I have been friends ever since school because both of us got bullied in high school (not at the same time) and bonded over our experience and the love for nerdy stuff like books, games and anime. Lilian and I grew apart when I got bullied because Lilian wanted to be one of the cool kids (she never bullied me, but she never took my side at that time) and I assume she was a bit jealous because I had better grades than her. Nevermind. \n\nThe years are passing by, Lilian and I have contact maybe once a year until we bought our house. Lilian was not amused because \"if she had known that the previous owner passes away soon, she would have waited and bought our house instead\" because it's bigger and right next to her parents.\n\nLilian has a son Ryan (4) and we have a daughter Amy (4). Amy goes to kindergarden in our old town (10 minute drive away) because all of her friends are there and the pre school program is much better. Ryan visits the local kindergarten. Lilian made sure that the kids didn't have contact as long as she held her grudge against us, but now as Beth lives here too, Lilian is friendlier and let's the kids play together. \n\nAnd now comes the problem. Ryan has massive bully-vibes. I know they are little kids, but as soon as other kids (his friends) are involved, they start to exclude Amy and bully her. Last time they played at Lilian's parents' garden they tried to pour cold water over Amy's head while she was on the swing. When Amy ran away, they chased her with water guns, making fun of her. I took her and we left because she was so sad. Another example: Ryan pretends to not knowing her name when others are around. But: When his friends are not there, he is rather nice to Amy and they play together.\n\nBeth thinks it's funny, Lilian thinks her golden child makes nothing wrong. I don't know what to do now. I don't want Amy to be sad but I want to protect her from the bully-vibes because I know how cruel bullying is. Amy is one of the shy kids and has no friends here in the new town (it's pretty little so all the other same-aged kids are friends with Ryan - maybe 5 or 6 kids with the same age in total). She cries when he and his friends are mean to her, but on the other side she is just happy when he is nice to her when they are alone.\n\nAITA if I don't let Amy play with Ryan anymore? I am okay with Lilian hating me for this but I would be sad if it ruins my friendship with Beth. Amy is too young to decide for herself.

I do find it really weird that Beth thinks it's funny, especially considering your shared being bullied experiences. Have you ever talked to her about this when it was just the two of you?", "NTA. You should always prioritize your child\u2019s feelings and future wellbeing over your adult friends/neighbors\u2019 feelings. Especially, the ones who don\u2019t take responsibility for their child\u2019s behavior.", "NTA This is a very dangerous behavioural pattern to let your child interiorise at such a young age. It is not okay or normal that she gets used to a boy being nice when they are alone but being mean when around his friends\u2026 this is how she gets set up to being abused in the future\u2026", "NTA and your being an awesome parent OP. No adult should be forced to spend time with a bully that tortures them, let alone a poor child. OP you are doing what is best for your daughter's mental health and happiness. Forget Amy and Beth. If they are just sitting around watching a child be an active bully and doing nothing they are terrible people and role models. And Amy completely fails at parenting for not trying to correct this behavior and encouraging it. And in the end Ryan will suffer the most from Amy's and Beth's lack of effort to correct his bullying behavior. If Ryan keeps up this behavior when he's in school he will end up having no friends and being the class bully everyone hates. Plus, Amy is already a shy kid she doesn't need even more challenges with making new friends. Also if this ruins your friendship with Beth than she wasn't really your friend OP. As a friend Beth should be able to understand your child is incredibly important to you and as a parent you will do anything in your power to keep your child healthy and happy and in this case that means keeping a bully away from your child.", "NTA\n\nAre you sensitive to what bullying is and looks like because you have been? Yes. Are you wrong? No. Even when Ryan is nice when his friends aren\u2019t there, then all of a sudden mean when they are will fuck with Amy\u2019s head. Fuck Beth! She thinks it\u2019s funny? Why are you worried about losing their friendship when your daughter pays the price? You\u2019re kinda TA for that if you let this continue.", "NTA that family is a pile of sentient trash. Two adults who condone bullying. Best to distance.", "NTA. You are protecting your daughter. Invite her old friends over for a playdate instead.", "NTa", "NTA - but that isn\u2019t bully-vibes it is just bullying.", "NTA.

You are never the asshole when you're putting your own child's priority over anybody else. Your kid will always cherish how you stood beside her, heard her problems, held her hand walking through difficulties together. \n\nAlso while you're at it, reconsider your friendship with not only Lilian but also Beth. Lilian was never a friend since by your own admission she did not choose your side during your childhood and also being vocally unhappy with you moving into the same neighborhood. You say  Beth and you bonded over the trauma over both of you being bullied in childhood yet she never stands by your daughter who's being bullied by her nephew, finds it funny, never corrects his behaviour and playing happy aunty to him. Since Beth has decided to stand by her bully nephew in the name of family, it's high time you prioritise your own daughter.\n\nYou should realise who your \"friends\" truly are and cut off these mean people from your life. If I were in your position I would have definitely severed any ties with these toxic people.", "NTA you are doing what you need to do to protect your daughter. If this was a once off thing where he was a kid who made a mistake and the other adults weren\u2019t encouraging or doing nothing to stop his behavior then I could see why you would feel like TA. But in this situation they are well aware of the behavior, have done nothing to stop it or correct it, and have tried to gaslight you into feeling okay about it. You do what you have to do to protect your daughters heart and well-being, and if that means not letting her play with Ryan, then so be it.", "NTA. The fact that Beth thinks it\u2019s funny makes her a huge AH to me. It\u2019s not funny to make a child cry. What\u2019s wrong with her? I would have yelled at Ryan myself honestly.", "NTA and I have a feeling the Beth finds it funny for a reason. If you let her be bullied then she will only get more shy and it\u2019s setting her up for failure when she reaches actual school she won\u2019t be able to make friends and she\u2019ll be the shy kid", "Yes I did. She loves being Ryans auntie and he is her golden child, too. That is the only thing I really don't like about her: That she thinks her family is flawless and makes everything right.", "We already do that! She sees them Mo-Fr in kindergarden and we try to meet them on weekends whenever possible.", "I can image that you don't like that about her! I personally don't think you're overreacting at all.", "Thank you very much!", "I think you're doing right by your kid. We have a neighbor with a rough home life, his mom doesn't seem to like him very much. He's a bully (understandably, probably the only way he can have any control over anything), and my son asks to play a lot. I'll have him over outside while I supervise, but that's it. My son isn't allowed to his house, he isn't allowed inside my house. This is where my kids should feel the safest, and I'll be damned if I invite a bully over, regardless that I feel bad for the kid.", "NTA.  You don't necessarily need to stop all contact with the kid, but you can set boundaries. They play as a duo, not in a group, and it is supervised at your house.", "I am wondering if you ARE too sensitive about the bullying history, with how Ryan plays with Amy? Playing with water guns is hardly bullying, and how would anyone be able to pour water on someone's head while they are on the swing? Amy needs to learn to choose for herself who she wants to play with or not, and why and why not. \"I don't like to play with Ryan, he is too rough,\" is Amy standing up for herself. \"I won't let Amy and Ryan play together anymore, and his mother was a bully too\" is making her a victim. Amy will make new friends in school.", "I disagree. That is classic cliquish behavior, from boys and girls, all through school, and Amy will have to learn to deal with it and stand up for herself. It is not a boy abusing a girl.", "We already do that! She sees them Mo-Fr in kindergarden and we try to meet on weekends whenever possible. So glad that her two besties live in the same school district so she will continue going to school with them.", "The swing is right next to a playhouse with a slide, so of you are standing on top of the slide you can pour the water over the swing.", "Maybe scale back your friendship with this woman.", "NTA. Please don't allow your child to play with him anymore. That on again off again behavior should never be seen as okay. Is it okay when adults treat each other like this? No, it isn't. You cannot allow a bully to be a \"part-time\" friend. The bad and bullying behavior needs to be called out everytime it happens and your daughter should know that a bully being nice doesn't mean they are NOT STILL a bully. This is also scary to think of the psychological \"conditioning\" that is going on in your daughter's mind with being exposed to this kind of nice and mean behavior from the same person on a regular basis. I don't know what IS happening, but it doesn't seem like it would be healthy for a kid to excuse the bad behavior of a bully if the bully \"sometimes is nice\". That sounds like a whole bunch of mess getting set up early in life.", "NTA but no offense, I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who thinks it's funny to watch my kid being bullied.", "You are going to have problems with that family the rest of your life living there. Be prepare for that. This is just the beginning. Nta.", "NTA. The aggressors are. Thats pretty straight forward.", "If the child doesn't like water or is terrified of water- I knew a child that flipped out with water if his mom was not there. It was an actual phobia they had to use CBT to get him over it, took a few years.  If she simply doesn't like getting wet, OR told them to stop and they didn't stop, yes, that ABSOLUTELY IS BULLYING. Something tells me you were not bullied much as a child, you were probably one of the \"cool kids\" who everybody loved. Not saying it's a bad thing, but empathy and compassion are also really important.", "NTA \n\nAnd Beth is no better than Lillian. Protect your child!!!\n\nRyan is 100% a bully and this hot/cold treatment is going to leave long lasting emotional scars. It\u2019s absolutely bullying and is going to teach your daughter that it\u2019s ok for people to abuse you in public if they are nice to you in private. \n\nPLEASE KEEP THOSE CHILDREN AWAY FROM HER!", "If that's the case, I would not be surprised if things escalate as he gets older. He doesn't sound like a kid who will respect your property or those living there. it might be a good idea to consider cameras.", "Well it won\u2019t be funny when the cops become involved because technically some of the stuff they are attempting to do is lower forms of harassment and assault. What would happen if you went up to some adult without permission and attempted  to pour cold water them and started chasing them water guns. It was a one side water gun fight where she was defenseless. Yeah, it\u2019s bullying vibes and also the pack mentality the psychological phenomenon where people do things they wouldn\u2019t normally do when in a group. As aunt and parent they need to talk to her about it", "Prertty sure you know nothing about me. Also, if you read my post, if Amy doesn't like what Ryan does, Amy can choose not to play with him. How is helping Amy stand up for herself a bad thing?", "That is an incredibly gross response, \"she will have to learn to deal with it\" Kids die because of bullying you know? Should they have learned to deal with it or were they told that and death is how they decided to deal with it? It is absolutely setting Amy up for abuse. Doing nothing NOW will teach her that in the future nothing will happen to the bullies, making what they do seem acceptable. I cannot believe its 2023 where suicides still happen to bullied kids and you are over here saying they have to deal with it, know what happens when kids stand up to bullies? They get punished. Shes a fucking CHILD, it is not HER RESPONSIBILITY to stop or end the bullying, its the fucking adults job to do that FOR HER so she can learn its not acceptable and actually have a chance to stand up for herself in the future. \"Learn to deal with it\" tell that to the fucking kids that kill tgemselves because they were being bullied and fucks like you told them to deal with it or toughen up. Godawful advice.", "Oh brother. Try to use a brain cell. Nowhere did I say that it was up to Amy to stop the bullying. I said that Amy can choose whether to play with him or not, giving HER agency. As she grows, she absolutely will have to deal with bratty kids, and how to stand up for herself. Are you like 12?", "Help your daughter meet and befriend other kids. Playgrounds may be an opportunity for her to meet kids as well as taking lessons in something like swimming.", "NTA - but sometimes it\u2019s better to have kids fight their own battles and navigate both the good and bad in life. Idk you\u2019re the parent and can judge this situation better than what we can based on a paragraph. But sometimes overprotectiveness can cause harm to the the child as well. It doesn\u2019t seem like your kid hates or is afraid of Ryan. I don\u2019t think trauma is the correct repercussions of his behavior. I feel that your daughter will be upset for a bit  and eventually drop her relationship with Ryan herself. And she will cherish the friends who really genuinely love and appreciate her presence.", "Overreacting?  Uh no, she is being targeted even at that young age.  You're NTAH.  Get her away from that little boy asap.", "NTA.  Not even a little.\n\nMaybe show them this post.  They might actually realize they are VERY MUCH part of a big problem.  Not likely, most bullies don't, unless they face major consequences alone.", "Can\u2019t believe you still like Beth.   Cut that trash off", "NTA. I was bullied in school, and it made my life hell. Keep Amy away from those kids and the adults. Sorry your friendship with Beth has to end, but she's not only complicit in the bullying behavior, she's probably encouraging it like Lilian. That's what parents and other family members do with the golden child; every whim gets indulged, and the child learns they can behave however they want because no one is going to punish them.", "NTA my brother did that kind of thing to me with his friends. It's good to keep her away from it if you can. This kind of thing isn't something most kids forget as they get older,  since it's so targeted", "I'd scale back the \"friendship\" with both Lillian and Beth.\nAs for your daughter, might be time to instill some \"fight back or perish\" vibes bc I'm sure these won't be the only bullies she encounters in life.", "100% a bully?!  Your jumping to conclusions based on a story from someone who clearly isn\u2019t over getting bullied.", "So how many kids did you bully in school?"]}
