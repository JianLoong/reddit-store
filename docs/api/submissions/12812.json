Let me just say that I have never minded this dynamic and I always let her know that I am okay with paying for her.\n\nLast night she texted me asking to make plans and saying that she would love to see me and spend time with me as it\u2019s been a few weeks since we have seen each other. She also lets me know she doesn\u2019t have any money but would love to go do something with me. She tells me that she doesn\u2019t have a lift home or money for Uber so I told her I would pay for us at the bar and I would gladly her home afterwards. \n\nI wait around for about 2 hours for her to let me know she\u2019s ready and we finally meet at the bar. Once we get inside she casually lets me know she invited a guy she has been talking to (this was their first time meeting) and that he is sitting waiting at a table for her by himself. Of course this confused me because why would she not mention this earlier? I didn\u2019t say anything to her until later in the evening after I had been paying for everything and awkwardly sitting there third wheeling between them. I told her I felt a bit used and it seemed like she only invited me because she needed me to fund her date. We ended up getting into an arguement so I decided to leave and go home. I told her to find her own way home and walked out. \n\nThis morning I woke up to a text from one of our mutual friends telling me I\u2019m an AH for leaving her at the bar knowing she didn\u2019t have a lift home.

She is **only** your friend, because you pay for her and provide her with rides.\n\nThink about this too: she went out of her way to immediately tell a mutual friend that you are TAH. I would bet $5000 she left out how she brought a surprise date and expected you to third wheel and pay. You will need to do damage control, because she has likely told her narrative to everyone in her phone already. This is how these types of people operate.\n\nI'm sorry to tell you this, but generous people like you end up getting screwed over by users like Hannah all the time. When you're a nice person, you cannot believe that such cruel schemers exist, but they do. And they trade on the fact that most nice people want to believe the best in others. It's very common not to figure it out until their schemes become ridiculous and obvious, but they'll always play that they're the victim. \n\nHannah could get a p/t job, but why would she bother when she can just scheme off you? That's her M.O.

If there are no buses or if it's not walkable then she could have sheepishly called a friend and asked for them to pick her up/order a taxi on their account. \n\nMy friend's card was blocked and she was stuck. She popped it in the group chat and we immediately offered to order Ubers. She was embarrassed but she got home.

You can't turn back time, but if she's safe and wasn't assaulted after you left then no regrets. \n\nSide note- inviting a date and expecting you to just happily bank roll the night sounds like a big leap from the dynamic y'all had. I just want to add though I've been in the position where my friends are very very broke and I was making good money and would often take them out for a great night. \n\nThey never expected it from and we're always grateful, but I didn't feel used. If up until this point you didn't feel used I wouldn't have a whole ass reflection on your entire friendship over this, but honestly that takes some nerve having a surprise date show up. Like if I was that guy I would pay for you and her. If I was you I'd take a break from hanging out with her for a bit, and see if she'd be interested in hanging out at your place and not just when you're out spending money. I think that's a good test to see who's really your friend vs using you.", "Why isn\u2019t she working? Most people who are studying work at least a few hours a week.

Some might could argue that maybe she just wanted a friend there in case things went wrong, but the fact that she didn\u2019t tell you until you were both arrived and settled in at the bar makes that kind of hard to believe for me. I\u2019m sure your anger led to some rash decisions, which is understandable. \n\nAt the same time, suddenly leaving her to fend for herself could have turned out badly. It would be different if she had money to call an Uber, but having to rely on someone to get her home for free could have been bad. If she had to call another friend to get her, you\u2019d be at fault by inconveniencing someone else and putting the burden on them. And if she chose to accept a free ride with a stranger or this man that she JUST met, that could\u2019ve ended badly\u2026 it\u2019s not safe.\n\nShe\u2019s using you for money, and you\u2019re trying to treat her like a friend when she isn\u2019t being much of one to you.

Either way, you and H should have gone to the restroom to powder your noses and then had a conversation with her on how you felt. Since H had a way to get there I have no doubt she could (and did) find a safe way home. Are you the asshole? Is H? Yep. So my vote is ESH because you both are equal assholes. You should apologize to H and H should apologize to you because best friends don\u2019t do shit like this towards each other - that\u2019s what enemies are for.", "ESH. just b/c you didn't make sure before you left she had a SAFE way of getting home. kinda girl code imo. she sounds like a sucky friend tho that is using you, not saying she's not an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There are horrible people out there who are always looking for victims, and the easier target you make of yourself the higher the chance they will choose you.  Because the world is not a safe place.  That's why people lock their doors, have alarms, carry mace, take self defense classes, etc.  That being said, while statistically women are often victimized more.  Men can be victims of crimes as well and should also take precautions.  \n\nAlso, it's not uncommon for a drunk friend to wander away and hurt themselves if left alone.  There are countless stories of people who died because they were drunk and alone and fall and hit their head, fell in a river, froze to death while outside, etc.  There is a more recent heartbreaking story where one young girl accidentally wandered off in a hotel while drunk and managed to lock herself in a freezer and froze the death.\n\nHannah was drinking and had no secure way home on her own.

It was quite refreshing, so I wanted to commend you on that.", "If this was late at night, there's a good chance the parents wouldn't be able to get her any money.\n\nIt is her job to be chaperone and chauffeur if she agreed to it.  OP should have put her foot down right away when the guy showed up saying this was not what she agreed to and before any drinking was involved.  (Though to be fair, I am speculating that Hannah was drinking, but since they were in a bar, I wild think that's fair conclusion).\n\nRather she waited until Hannah was in a vulnerable position, that's not okay.", "- you dont know what time this was, also - venmo exists. \n- she didnt agree to be a chaperone \n- OP did put her foot down right away \n- yes, you are assuming Hannah was already drinking \n- Hannah is an adult", "To be fair, Vemno and the like are not a thing everywhere - in my country, bank transfers are free but only go through during working hour on weekdays if you're transferring to somebody with a different bank than you!", "So, she wanted to use you as an ATM and as Uber for her date, but told you she wanted to spend time with you. Oh, hell no.\n\nNTA!", "NTA. You were very kind to pay. I wouldn\u2019t have. I would have told her date to make sure she got home and left. She\u2019s using you and knows it.

Because I would snip her out of my life.", "NTA. She invited you to hang out with her and failed to mention that you were third wheeling on a date that she expected you to fund???? she is a user.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. Her date should have taken her home or paid her way. She decided not to leave with you, and to take advantage of your kindness. She FAFO. I wonder how she explained you to her sate?", "NTA and I'd clarify your side with the mutual because... they MUST have an odd version of the story. If not, whelp time to drop 2 friends", "YTA to yourself. I had a best friend like this, as soon as I stopped paying for everything she pulled back to nothing.

Leaving a woman at a bar with a first date (aka stranger) with no safe way to get home is potentially life-threatening. SHE COULD DIE because you did that.

It **always** ends badly. Do stuff together that doesn\u2019t require cash.", "The only way you would be TA is if you purposely left her in an unsafe situation where she might get taken advantage of. But, without more context I cannot say that is what you did. Her behavior is appalling and you had every right to be upset and feel used.

How about be honest and say, hey, I need your help, I\u2019m meeting a guy, but I have no money. NTA", "Why do that when you can bank on OP paying for stuff?? Much easier this way", "To be honest I don\u2019t even really think he knew I was was paying for her drinks because I was just trying to be as subtle as possible to not make her look bad. I would go pay at the bar and bring our drinks back to the table. And I offered him a few drinks because I was just trying to get everyone to enjoy themselves but I ended up feeling extremely awkward", "100% this.  I was the broke friend.  I had some savings but I tried to avoid dipping into it whenever possible.  If we were going out to the movies, I\u2019d usually reimburse my friends for my ticket since I only had cash.  If we went to a restaurant, I just drank water or maybe occasionally splurged and got a soda.  Usually, we did game nights or hung out at someone\u2019s (mostly my) house.  If it was too expensive, I didn\u2019t do it.  I always coordinated my rides to and from places.  If I couldn\u2019t arrange transportation, I either asked my parents for help or didn\u2019t go.  Occasionally my friends would pay for me as a treat but I would NEVER expect that from them.  And anything I was treated to, I always made sure to convey how grateful I was.  \n\nOne of my most treasured things is a pair of heels that my husband bought for me before we even started dating.  He felt bad that I wasn\u2019t able to spend money on myself so he would pay for me a lot.  He needed to replace his shoes, he saw me eyeing the shoes, and they were having a BOGO sale at Payless so he told me to pull them in my size and he would get them for me.  I haven\u2019t been able to wear them for awhile but I still keep them because they\u2019re so special to me.  Sorry, tangent over now.  But yeah, this is not \u201cbroke friend\u201d behavior, this is \u201cI\u2019m broke and entitled to spend YOUR money because I can\u201d behavior.", "\"Future faking\" is one of the ways exploitive people take advantage of giving people.", "I had a brief time where I went back to school and all my good friends were making pretty decent money. I had no income and lived on loans (in an expensive area). My friends were generous and insisted on paying sometimes to include me in activities where they really wanted me there (think rental houses for weddings, celebratory dinners, weekend trips). I was always a) extremely appreciative and never, EVER expected it b) did any small gesture I could to contribute or do favors to make their lives easier, even if it was labor or something homemade c) never suggested or asked for anything I knew I could not afford and that someone would need to offer to cover on my behalf. And as soon as I started making good money, I paid it forward and was generous whenever possible. \n\nThis is how you can tell if someone is using you vs appreciative of a friend\u2019s generosity. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been used by someone you clearly care so much about.", "Here\u2019s what I will say. I\u2019ve had my best friend in my life since we were in middle school. And, there was a period of time after we graduated HS where I had more money then her as I lived with my parents while I went to school. And, my parents agreed I didn\u2019t have to pay any bills outside of my own car insurance and gas as long as I had a full time for anything else I may need (spending time with friends etc). And, because of that I was able to have quite a chunk of money and one of my friends wasn\u2019t as fortunate to be as financially stable. \n\nShe was always okay with doing free things like coming over to my house - me going over to hers and just hanging out with each others company. When I wanted to do more fun things and I wanted her there I would always offer to cover her and I did so because I wanted her presence. She never asked, and she always felt bad but I wanted her there. And, she still supported me as a friend emotionally. \n\nAnd, now she\u2019s more financially stable and although we\u2019re states away when I see her she does small things and buys things here and there even when I protest. \n\nYour friendship definitely feels one sided, and feels like she only wants to spend time with you when she wants to go out and do something that she doesn\u2019t have the money for. And, then to not even ask you if it\u2019s okay for her date to show - and expected you to only pay for her drinks and take her home - but, just expects you to sit there and do what? Watch her be on a date? I\u2019d get it had she talked to you and it was a safety thing but she didn\u2019t even mention it. And, if her grades are a concern as to why she can\u2019t work should she really be trying to add a relationship into the mix?", "I completely agree. That\u2019s why ESH. Friend should have been up front but wasn\u2019t. OP could have handled her frustration differently and not left her friend at the bar. \n\nIdeally friend would have been up front and asked OP if she could be there for safety and to help with cost if this meet went south. Presumably if they didn\u2019t hit it off she would spend evening hanging with friend. That would have allowed OP the opportunity to decide if she was willing/interested to do this or even bring another friend herself. \n\nSince that didn\u2019t happen, I think the mature thing for OP to do would have been to quietly express concerns to friend at the bar. Followed by a more serious convo at a later day/time.", "If Hannah had a ride prearranged with OP and no money, OP put her in danger.", "So is Hannah not a capable adult who is responsible for herself?", "!updateme", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't see you as a friend.

It weird either way but I was just curious.", "NTA how long are you going to allow yourself to be used! Paying and driving her home all the time just led her to believe she could use you anytime she wanted. I hope you end this one way friendship. You made the right decision leaving, she wanted your money and lift home that night, not you.", "you're not an asshole and she's not your friend.", " NTA at all!! I have friends who make more money than I do. When I\u2019m broke and want to hang out, I ask if we can hang out at one of our homes. It feels icky that she is so comfortable spending your money.", "What happened with the guy? He couldn't have taken her home?", "Nta she expext.you to pay for her and her new bf that her own fault she an adult she can't afford to go out don't go out", "I think this might get a lot of downvotes but I\u2019m honestly split here. I think leaving was justified, but (I\u2019m assuming here) your friend is a woman who was left alone at a bar with a stranger. Yes she used you, but you also knew she had no way home? I\u2019m not saying she deserved your kindness but you did leave her in a potentially dangerous situation. Granted Hannah put herself in that situation, but I\u2019m guessing it was only because she had a planned way out. I think soft YTA since when you decided to leave you didn\u2019t offer her the choice to get her ride home then. \n\nNTA for getting upset or removing yourself from the situation, and who knows if Hannah would have agreed to go home then anyway. \n\nOverall I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make a final judgment here. Exercising boundaries is a good thing and you had every right to leave. But even though Hannah\u2019s TA here she\u2019s still a person who could have been in danger. I think there\u2019s more you should have done, even just one little attempt to get her home. She\u2019s still an adult who needs to face consequences of her actions, but that  honestly could have led to her getting raped or murdered. Is that a justified consequence for being a terrible friend? Ultimately that would have been Hannah\u2019s own fault and not OP\u2019s because she put herself in that situation. \n\nThink about the kind of person you want to be, OP. If you think Hannah should have had to face whatever consequences might have come, NTA. But if you think you shouldn\u2019t have left her without any help, YTA.", "NTA holy crap Hannah sounds like a tool, setting up her first date with a guy and expecting you to pay for it.

She called her cousin who came to pick her up but was obviously annoyed with Hannah as she had to drop her plans so they had an argument too. \n\nAs for mine and her friendship - I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s over. I didn\u2019t bother messaging her today,  I think she knows what she did was wrong and sometimes it\u2019s better to walk away from people and save your breath.

Your husband sounds like a keeper!", "I never said no woman (single or otherwise) should never go out by herself.  However, drinking by yourself is often never a good idea.  As alcohol consumption can make one an easier target and/or prone to accidents.  The risks increase exponentially the more intoxicated one is.", "Getting really, really drunk out alone is bad but I struggle with this idea that her friend cant be left alone just bc alcohol is involved.
