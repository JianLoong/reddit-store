She is still studying full time where as I have been working for the last few years while we have had this friendship. It\u2019s become the norm for me to pay for both of us when we go out and do something together because she obviously doesn\u2019t have money as she\u2019s not working at all. Let me just say that I have never minded this dynamic and I always let her know that I am okay with paying for her.\n\nLast night she texted me asking to make plans and saying that she would love to see me and spend time with me as it\u2019s been a few weeks since we have seen each other. She also lets me know she doesn\u2019t have any money but would love to go do something with me. She tells me that she doesn\u2019t have a lift home or money for Uber so I told her I would pay for us at the bar and I would gladly her home afterwards. \n\nI wait around for about 2 hours for her to let me know she\u2019s ready and we finally meet at the bar. Once we get inside she casually lets me know she invited a guy she has been talking to (this was their first time meeting) and that he is sitting waiting at a table for her by himself. Of course this confused me because why would she not mention this earlier? I didn\u2019t say anything to her until later in the evening after I had been paying for everything and awkwardly sitting there third wheeling between them. I told her I felt a bit used and it seemed like she only invited me because she needed me to fund her date. We ended up getting into an arguement so I decided to leave and go home. I told her to find her own way home and walked out. \n\nThis morning I woke up to a text from one of our mutual friends telling me I\u2019m an AH for leaving her at the bar knowing she didn\u2019t have a lift home. I do feel bad because maybe I should have taken her home instead of leaving her there. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit for extra info: Her cousin dropped her off at the bar and I drove in my own car.", "created_utc": 1679386688, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xaqdq/aita_for_leaving_my_best_friend_at_the_bar_after/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were completely justified in leaving.", "NTA \n\nThat is a super AH move of her to invite a date over without asking you beforehand, and basically asking you to fund their date.\n\nIt's also weird AF the guy have no means of providing transportation for her home too.\n\n>one of our mutual friends telling me I\u2019m an AH for leaving her at the bar knowing she didn\u2019t have a lift home.\n\nAsk your mutual friend to fund her dates and uber her home from now on then.", "Congrats, OP. You're her sugarmama.\n\nNTA but your \"bestfriend\" is. Stop funding her lifestyle.", "NTA. I see why you felt used, since I guess that was exactly what was going on.", "NTA\n\nHannah is not your best friend; she is a charismatic \"user\". She is **only** your friend, because you pay for her and provide her with rides.\n\nThink about this too: she went out of her way to immediately tell a mutual friend that you are TAH. I would bet $5000 she left out how she brought a surprise date and expected you to third wheel and pay. You will need to do damage control, because she has likely told her narrative to everyone in her phone already. This is how these types of people operate.\n\nI'm sorry to tell you this, but generous people like you end up getting screwed over by users like Hannah all the time. When you're a nice person, you cannot believe that such cruel schemers exist, but they do. And they trade on the fact that most nice people want to believe the best in others. It's very common not to figure it out until their schemes become ridiculous and obvious, but they'll always play that they're the victim. \n\nHannah could get a p/t job, but why would she bother when she can just scheme off you? That's her M.O. Do not stay friends with her.", "NTA she took advantage of you I would have left too", "NTA she was using you and legitimately didn\u2019t care that she lied to you, used you, and was comfortable doing this on a first date\u2026.I think you need a better friend", "NTA - She basically was trying to use you as a free ride with her and the guy it sounds like to me, you had every right to leave", "Your friend went out with you under false pretenses. When it became clear she lied about the plan, you reneged on your agreement to drive her home. \n\nSince she had clearly lied to you about the plan, it doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable that you finished discontinuing the plan. You told her this then and there - you didn\u2019t leave her with any ambiguity. \n\nSince she canceled the plan first, you were no longer under any obligation to honor it, beyond telling her that it was off. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nShe initiated the text. It was her responsibility to communicate the plans. She knew what she was doing. She and the dude was just mooching off you for drinks and a ride. Gross!\n\nNext time something like this happens, don't fall for it.", "NTA\n\nShe used you, and in a weird way. She initiate the meetup which makes me think this is going to be a life system for her.\n\nShe could have: Walked, asked another friend or family member as an emergency ride, take a bus and walk (probably much cheaper than Uber).", "I was all set to vote you an AH from your title but geez NTA, she treated you very unfairly and if she wanted a ride home she still could have left with you when you left.", "Hannah and her date were looking to mooch from you. Couldn't she get a ride from her date?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Bringing a random guy (a DATE, no less) was rude AF. I would love to know what he thought of this whole thing. Did she lure him out with the promise of free beer? Did he know you were gonna be there? \n\nShe had options. Not ones she liked but they were there. If there are no buses or if it's not walkable then she could have sheepishly called a friend and asked for them to pick her up/order a taxi on their account. \n\nMy friend's card was blocked and she was stuck. She popped it in the group chat and we immediately offered to order Ubers. She was embarrassed but she got home. I don't believe for a second that a similar option wasn't available for this person.", "NTA\n\nshe's an adult woman who can take care of herself. You're not her mother or her butler.", "NTA\n\nI'm a firm believer in no man left behind EVER, and was ready to say your an AH based on the post title. \n\nBut instead of awkwardly being present for and paying for their date I would have been upfront about that not having been the plan, told her you were leaving, and offering her a way home before you left. You can't turn back time, but if she's safe and wasn't assaulted after you left then no regrets. \n\nSide note- inviting a date and expecting you to just happily bank roll the night sounds like a big leap from the dynamic y'all had. I just want to add though I've been in the position where my friends are very very broke and I was making good money and would often take them out for a great night. \n\nThey never expected it from and we're always grateful, but I didn't feel used. If up until this point you didn't feel used I wouldn't have a whole ass reflection on your entire friendship over this, but honestly that takes some nerve having a surprise date show up. Like if I was that guy I would pay for you and her. If I was you I'd take a break from hanging out with her for a bit, and see if she'd be interested in hanging out at your place and not just when you're out spending money. I think that's a good test to see who's really your friend vs using you.", "Why isn\u2019t she working? Most people who are studying work at least a few hours a week. My niece was studying for her dentistry degree which was 8-5 m-f at uni plus studying at home and still managed to pick up at least 1 shift a week to pay for her occasional fun outing etc while living at home.", "ESH\n\nIt was wrong of her to blindside you and treat you with disregard the entire night, and at the same time expect you to pay for her and cater to her every need. Some might could argue that maybe she just wanted a friend there in case things went wrong, but the fact that she didn\u2019t tell you until you were both arrived and settled in at the bar makes that kind of hard to believe for me. I\u2019m sure your anger led to some rash decisions, which is understandable. \n\nAt the same time, suddenly leaving her to fend for herself could have turned out badly. It would be different if she had money to call an Uber, but having to rely on someone to get her home for free could have been bad. If she had to call another friend to get her, you\u2019d be at fault by inconveniencing someone else and putting the burden on them. And if she chose to accept a free ride with a stranger or this man that she JUST met, that could\u2019ve ended badly\u2026 it\u2019s not safe.\n\nShe\u2019s using you for money, and you\u2019re trying to treat her like a friend when she isn\u2019t being much of one to you. Put your foot down and tell her that you won\u2019t go back out with her until she can afford it herself, and if she continues to use you don\u2019t waste your time with her.", "Info- did you say you wanted to leave and offer her a lift then or did you just leave?\n\nIt does seem that she was using you I\u2019m afraid, although maybe she just wanted the safety of you being there for her to meet this guy for the first time", "Did you also fund H\u2019s date too, or just H? Either way, you and H should have gone to the restroom to powder your noses and then had a conversation with her on how you felt. Since H had a way to get there I have no doubt she could (and did) find a safe way home. Are you the asshole? Is H? Yep. So my vote is ESH because you both are equal assholes. You should apologize to H and H should apologize to you because best friends don\u2019t do shit like this towards each other - that\u2019s what enemies are for.", "ESH. just b/c you didn't make sure before you left she had a SAFE way of getting home. kinda girl code imo. she sounds like a sucky friend tho that is using you, not saying she's not an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
