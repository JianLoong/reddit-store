May be a good idea to see if the custody agreement can be amended so you can\u2019t be forced to spend time with her.", "She was glad that she left you? And she's asking for an apology? Oh, heck, no! You are not being too harsh in blocking your mother since she essentially blocked you. She is a huge AH and your dad is a a-holish for telling you that you are being too harsh.\n\nI am so sorry about that your brother and you are going through this. I hope that you can have some counseling to help you deal with this.\n\nBTW, what do your maternal grandparents say about this? I would hope that they would give their daughter a verbal smack-down.\n\nNTA, for the record.", "NTA \n\nShe really just\u2026 moved? That\u2019s really hurtful. You don\u2019t say how old you are but I\u2019m assuming you and your brother are between 11 and 16 based on the story and the fact that neither of you are driving yourselves. Your mom may have every right to do whatever she wants, but she\u2019s a mom to two kids who are at very formative ages and her choice to do this will have a pretty severe impact on you and your brother. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. My sincerest advice would be to just spend time with your dad, and maybe ask to start seeing a therapist if you aren\u2019t already (I know they put me in therapy when my parents divorced, so maybe you\u2019re already seeing someone). But this sounds like it\u2019s going to be a lot to process, and a professional might help.", "NTA but don't be too hard on your dad, either.  He's trying to maintain some semblance of a good relationship with her for the sake of you and your brother.  Privately, he's probably at least as disgusted as you are but good parents don't badmouth the other parent...even when the other parent richly deserves it.  \n\nWhat your mom did is pretty disgusting.  I'm betting she won't understand why you don't want to have a relationship with her because if she understood how wrong her actions were, she wouldn't have done them in the first place.  I get why you feel the way you do, but respect the position your dad is in.\n\nIf he talks to you about it, listen to what he has to say.  Then say \"We understand you want us to have some relationship with her.  She made it clear she isn't really interested in having one with us.  If she ever decides to offer us a meaningful apology and make an effort to have a relationship with us, we'll consider it.  Right now, we're just not interested.\"", "I am so sorry... that was horribly unkind & so not fair. You deserve better & you should take as long as you need before talking to her.

She did abondon you, she didn't even tell you that she was planning on getting married, or invite you to the wedding.

Op I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this. \n\nYour mother is right at this moment in time not being a good mother. I understand why you are doing what you are doing because you are now trying to protect yourself and your expectations of the relationship between you and your mother. You do what you need to do and I strongly suggest speaking to a therapist. They may offer in the future to be a mediator between you and your mum but that should happen when you are ready to. Your dad also needs to speak to legal.", "NTA, you were right and she didn't like it.", "NTA.  Your mom chose one of the absolutely worst ways to announce that she was going to get married to somebody else.  It is very clear that your mother and her boyfriend haven't given you the opportunity to even meet your new siblings before the marriage.  I suspect that doing that would have given some indication whether or not there were going to be problems blending families - and some people are so committed to a choice they refuse to see the possible problems attached to that same choice.  \n\n\nFrankly, the way that your mom did this was so cowardly I'm surprised that your dad isn't angrier at her.  Because if my ex pulled a stunt like this I wouldn't be just upset I would be LIVID.  That said, your dad might be trying his darndest to make sure that you still have a relationship with her, even if he is seething inside, to make sure he isn't accused of parental alienation (although your mom seems to be doing a pretty good job of alienating you and your brother all by herself).  However, he has to make sure that he has to honor your very much justified anger and not just stuff it in a box.  It's a tricky thing to do.\n\nFrom my POV, it appears that your mom was very much afraid of your reaction to the news, so she decided to let her absence do the talking for her.  She's not the first conflict-averse person to walk this planet, but she is a grownup and grownups use their words to talk things through.  They don't just run away and drop the ball and that is exactly what she did.  She could have given you and your brother time to digest this by delaying the wedding.  She could have at the very least been open and honest with you as soon as she found out she was pregnant.  She's the one who has to issue the apology, not you.\n\nAs a mom myself, I'm going to give you all the internet hugs.  What you and your brother experienced - it isn't right at all.", "She doesn\u2019t want you guys in her new life and situation in my opinion. She thinks her life will be perfect now because of her new husband and kids. You don\u2019t deserve to waste your energies and resources to try and prove yourself to your mother as worthy. Go low or no contact and cherish your dad. Sorry for the harsh words OP, I hope you get the best in life. We can\u2019t choose our parents unfortunately and they are humans too and commit mistakes", "I am so sorry. You are NOT the a.", "Fuck the egg donor.   Wow. Total Cee U Never T.  \n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with that.   You don't have to do anything you don't want to.   Total asshattery", "NTA she did abandon you for a new family. Sheesh didn't invite you to her wedding, didn't tell you where she was. I am sorry. Your mom is all about herself. Do not lower yourself to apologize because you did nothing wrong at all", "NTA.

It is not up to you to fix the problem that your mother caused by her behavior. Just as others have posted here, this is abandonment. She agreed to have you for a long weekend, but was not even in the right state! She may be going through something, but she is the **parent and it is up to her to fix this issue** (if she even can.)  She has the right to get married and have another child, but she does not have the right to keep you in the dark to the point that you don't even know where she is when she is supposed to have you in her home. You have to decide what you want in the way of your relationship, but you do not own her an apology in any shape or form.  \nHugs to your brother and you from this internet stranger.", "Your mom told you to come for the weekend despite knowing she wouldn't be there. She let your dad make a 3 hour drive(ONE WAY so really 6 hours) to drop you off at an empty house. She's lucky your dad is too naive to call the cops for child abandonment. Because that's what she did. So whatever \"it\" is that she's going through, she deserves worse. Do not get back into contact with her anytime soon."]}
