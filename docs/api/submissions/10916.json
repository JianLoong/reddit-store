When my parents divorced they agreed that throughout the weekdays we would stay with my dad and the weekends with my mom. She lives about 2-3 hours away from us now so it\u2019s a pretty long trip. \n\nFor about 2 months now my mom only let us stay only till Saturday. On Sundays she was always in a rush to get us to leave which was kinda hurtful but we never asked why. My mom suddenly stopped sending her daily texts which was out of character for her to do and she would only reply when we texted first. Last weekend I asked her if we could stay the whole weekend with them because it was a long weekend since we had no school on Monday. She agreed to have us over so I was pretty overjoyed to spend some days with her since we haven\u2019t seen her for about 3 weeks. \n\nSo on Friday our dad drove us to her house he dropped us off and immediately I noticed that their cars weren\u2019t there and the lights were off. At first i assumed that maybe she was home alone so I rung the doorbell and no one answered. I told my brother to call her to see if she was even home and he did, she didn\u2019t answer. I started freaking out and assuming that something bad happened to her. We were out there for about 20 mins when my dad called and he sounded pretty upset. \n\nThat\u2019s when he told us that she\u2019s in a completely different state. She moved away with her boyfriend without telling us. My brother and I were just kinda standing there in disbelief when she called me. I started crying and screaming at her for an explanation and what irritates me the most is that she sounded so offended by the fact that i was so upset by this. She told me that she got married with him and now i have 3 new siblings and one that is coming soon, she\u2019s pregnant. She even had the audacity to talk about how cute the kids were and how the girl even looks like me. That\u2019s when i accused her of abandoning us for a new family which caught her off guard because she went quiet. She said that she was glad that she left us and that\u2019s the last time i talked to her. \n\nShe has tried to get me to apologize to her but I refuse. Today I blocked her and decided to go no contact with her, my brother too. My dad thinks that we\u2019re being a bit too harsh with her but i\u2019m simply too hurt by this. \n\nSo AITA? am i overreacting?\n\nEdit: Few details i left out, my mom does have BPD. I\u2019m not sure if this has anything to do with how she acted but i think it\u2019s important to bring up. I am 15F and my brother is 17 turning 18. This event took place LAST weekend, my mom has tried to reach out to us throughout the week but we\u2019re simply not ready to talk to her yet.

My sincerest advice would be to just spend time with your dad, and maybe ask to start seeing a therapist if you aren\u2019t already (I know they put me in therapy when my parents divorced, so maybe you\u2019re already seeing someone).

Privately, he's probably at least as disgusted as you are but good parents don't badmouth the other parent...even when the other parent richly deserves it.  \n\nWhat your mom did is pretty disgusting.  I'm betting she won't understand why you don't want to have a relationship with her because if she understood how wrong her actions were, she wouldn't have done them in the first place.  I get why you feel the way you do, but respect the position your dad is in.\n\nIf he talks to you about it, listen to what he has to say.

Your mom chose one of the absolutely worst ways to announce that she was going to get married to somebody else.  It is very clear that your mother and her boyfriend haven't given you the opportunity to even meet your new siblings before the marriage.  I suspect that doing that would have given some indication whether or not there were going to be problems blending families - and some people are so committed to a choice they refuse to see the possible problems attached to that same choice.  \n\n\nFrankly, the way that your mom did this was so cowardly I'm surprised that your dad isn't angrier at her.  Because if my ex pulled a stunt like this I wouldn't be just upset I would be LIVID.  That said, your dad might be trying his darndest to make sure that you still have a relationship with her, even if he is seething inside, to make sure he isn't accused of parental alienation (although your mom seems to be doing a pretty good job of alienating you and your brother all by herself).  However, he has to make sure that he has to honor your very much justified anger and not just stuff it in a box.  It's a tricky thing to do.\n\nFrom my POV, it appears that your mom was very much afraid of your reaction to the news, so she decided to let her absence do the talking for her.  She's not the first conflict-averse person to walk this planet, but she is a grownup and grownups use their words to talk things through.  They don't just run away and drop the ball and that is exactly what she did.  She could have given you and your brother time to digest this by delaying the wedding.  She could have at the very least been open and honest with you as soon as she found out she was pregnant.  She's the one who has to issue the apology, not you.\n\nAs a mom myself, I'm going to give you all the internet hugs.

It is not up to you to fix the problem that your mother caused by her behavior. Just as others have posted here, this is abandonment. She agreed to have you for a long weekend, but was not even in the right state! She may be going through something, but she is the **parent and it is up to her to fix this issue** (if she even can.)  She has the right to get married and have another child, but she does not have the right to keep you in the dark to the point that you don't even know where she is when she is supposed to have you in her home.

She let your dad make a 3 hour drive(ONE WAY so really 6 hours) to drop you off at an empty house. She's lucky your dad is too naive to call the cops for child abandonment.

Hugs from the internet. \n\nYou didn\u2019t overreact nor do you owe her an apology. You mom\u2019s BPD may explain her actions, but it doesn\u2019t excuse it. She is wrong for what she did and she is wrong to push for YOU to apologize to HER. To anyone who says otherwise list the bare facts. 1. She got married with out telling you. 2. She moved without telling you. 3. She made plans with you KNOWING she wouldn\u2019t be there. There are other things, but you get the idea. Until she takes ownership of her actions she doesn\u2019t deserve contact with you. \n\nConsider even if she does say she wants to apologize and you agree to see her, don\u2019t do it alone or even just with your brother. Ask you grandma (if you can trust her to be on your side), your dad, or a third party like a family therapist to be there so she will have a harder time gaslighting or blaming you. \n\nMost of all, remember this is not your fault.", "NTA. She left the state without telling anyone. While that might not be legal abandonment since your father has custody, it's certainly emotional abandonment. That being said, it certainly sounds like something that could be caused by a bipolar episode.  While this is likely a result of her mental illness, actions still have consequences and you're under no obligation to talk to her until and if you feel ready. I suspect that she went off her meds when she discovered she was pregnant, leading to this. If you see her again, it should be under controlled circumstances", "So NTA.", "And child support.", "My mom abandoned me when I was 14 in a similar fashion and I was left with a family member who sexually and verbally abused me.

She can't broker a relationship, so she should stay out of this.\n\nMy sympathies. OP.  You deserve so much better.", "NTA you actually have nothing to apologize for because she agreed with you, she's glad she left you she actually said that, those kind of heartless people don't deserve love in their life they aren't capable of understanding what love is, that life possibly won't last because it was a rush for her and if it doesn't and she comes crawling back just say \"I thought you were glad that you left us\" and then just cut off contact again and leave her to her decisions and she can see where it gets her\n\nIt's hard with family but with them treating you this way they obviously don't care for you like a family should, so for your own sake you can't consider then family", "NTA at all.

I think LC or NC is the best option right now, and maybe talk to your dad about some therapy, maybe individually or with him and your sibling.\n\nIt's quite possible your mother's mental illness is a big part of this, but that doesn't change how hurt and betrayed you must feel.

Please get therapy as soon as you can.", "If they are available in your area, I highly recommend Jewish Family Services.  In our area they charge on a sliding scale.", "Agree with you.  And she demanded an apology after saying such a cruel thing as \u201cI\u2019m glad I left you\u201d?  Oh, hell, no!  That is unforgivable.", "Her BPD doesn\u2019t explain or excuse her actions. Maybe the impulsivity, but even with BPD a mother who cares about her kids isn\u2019t just going to up and abandon them like OP\u2019s mom.", "*hugs*\n\nBorderline or Bipolar? Just out of curiousity.\n\nYour mom sucks. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s a shitty person.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s all that sorry, is she?", "You are absolutely NTA, although it is awful to say, but you were abandoned for a different family. Others have already talked about the danger of being sent to an empty house and her mental issues so I won\u2019t touch that much, but these sort of events aren\u2019t spur of the moment things and we\u2019re thought about. So even if your mother comes back and says she regrets her actions, the die has already been cast.\n\nNow, moving on. Although I may be overstepping my bounds with writing this, given what you are going through and how recent it occurred, I thought I should include some advice and regrets that I had as someone who experiences a similar situation. In my case it was an abusive father who cheated on my mother leading to a divorce, split custody since our injuries healed before the investigation, and then similarly my father telling my sister and I (around 10-11 years old at the time ) that were weren\u2019t worth it before abandoning us for his new family somewhere in Europe. So pretty similar.\n\nFirstly and most importantly, know that this isn\u2019t your fault in any way, shape, or form. If you were like me when I went through this situation, then you would be in pain thinking about what you did wrong, why you weren\u2019t enough for them to stay, and what you could have done differently, but stop those thoughts right away. Parents that do this sort of thing aren\u2019t thinking rationally and considering others in the first place, it is all about them and has nothing to do with you.\n\nThe second thing is to really be aware and appreciate your brother and your father. You are not alone and from what it sounds like from your post, your brother and father love you very much. You are now the three musketeers and by going through this you will all be closer than ever before so make sure that you appreciate them and support each other during this emotional time. Now, I have some specific things when it comes to your father. The most important thing is to try to go easy on him. Try not to take the resentment you have for your mother leaving on your father. He is the one that is there so it is easy to place the blame and pain you feel onto him, but remember that he is still with you and trying to do the best for you. It may hurt to see him try to defend or downplay your mothers \u201cabandonment\u201d, but it is most likely to save any sort of relationship that you might have with you mom as well as making you feel less hurt. Although he is probably furious as well, if he were to show that response to you that it would be the same as affirming that he thought she abandoned you. So try to keep these things into mind and remember to cherish those who are there for you.\n\nThe last thing I would strongly recommend would be going through therapy. It will help you deal with all of these troubles you are going through and help with abandonment issues if you end up having it like I did which took years to manage. I empathize with you a lot. Make sure to protect yourself, you deserve to be happy.", "NTA and HUG!", "Nta She hurt you.", "NTA omg, im so so sorry that you\u2019re having to deal with this. I understand your mother has mental illness but it\u2019s her responsibility to focus on getting better if she made the choice to have children. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re in therapy atm but I would definitely recommend it. If you choose to go no contact with your mother that is 100% understandable", "NTA\nOh honey, your mom is sick. She\u2019s not in her right mind and if she\u2019s pregnant she\u2019s probably stopped her meds. It\u2019s beyond devastating and brutal to be told she\u2019s glad she left, and there\u2019s no excuse ever that justifies that, but there likely is a reason. It\u2019s not about you. She\u2019s not capable of a straight thought and her brain chemistry is not okay. The kids she\u2019s around now would honestly be better off if she wasn\u2019t with them, either. \nWishing she was different into the point that it steals all your energy  and focus will only break your heart more. This really sucks. Your feelings are 100% normal and valid and you need to feel them, but don\u2019t stop trying to live your own best life and create the future and kind of person you want to become. \nTry to detach from your emotions about this situation a little as much as you can. Look at it as a problem that you can navigate, one right decision for your own best interest at a time. Starting with healing while you live with the loving, stable parent you do have. Give him a big hug. Healthy parents hurt inside when our kids are hurting. \nYou are brave but it\u2019s okay not to be so strong all the time.

Slamming the book shut won\u2019t be easy,but just keep steady,appreciate that dad and brother of yours and let time do its job. IF forgiveness ever comes,it should be a long time from now.
