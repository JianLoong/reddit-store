I won\u2019t name which one but he is my great uncle. I also share his last name, which isn\u2019t bad because it\u2019s a somewhat common last name where I am from. So it\u2019s not like people hear my name and react like my last name is Hitler or something. Sometimes I will get a \u201coh (last name) haha, any relation?\u201d.\n\nThis is a dictator in living history, like my parents generation were affected by it (and the kids of my parents generation, ie my age group). I\u2019m 18 for context. Some people might just find it funny but others would find it genuinely offensive and upsetting, sadly other people think he is super cool and awesome . It\u2019s a very touchy and contentious subject in the community I live. I would not tell random people about this.\n\nMy friend does however do this. I don\u2019t think he totally understands because he isn\u2019t from the same country as me and probably isn\u2019t as familiar with this dictator or why people of our nationality find him so contentious. My friend will in mid conversation suddenly announce did you know she\u2019s related to (dictator)? and they always turn to me for confirmation. A lot of the time they find it funny so I let it slide but a week ago my friend told one of our teachers, who turned to us and told us that my great uncle put his family members in labor camps. Very awkward. I apologized and said I was sorry and left which felt weird because I don\u2019t really bear any responsibility for the guy. I told my friend to please stop and explained the like. Ethnic tension involved in the subject he may not understand. He seemed to agree so I let it go.\n\nThe other day I was talking to his friend who is a recent immigrant and he told her and she looked really weirded out and uncomfortable. I told her I don\u2019t like him either and never met the man. After she left I turned to my friend and asked what the hell his problem is and why he finds it so goddamn funny. He seemed to think I was overreacting and I said this is like if you went up to jews and said oh btw this person is related to hitler! like it\u2019s a funny joke when that\u2019s really insensitive. Both me and my friend have a kind of... i wouldn\u2019t describe it as offensive or dark sense of humor but something along those lines, so my friend was pretty surprised I was telling him to stop being insensitive (Even though I literally did that last week!!!) We were hanging outside and I think he was embarrassed other people were there because he refused to apologize and even told someone walking by \u201cShe\u2019s related to (dictator)!\u201d all smugly. I told him I was tired of his shit and left and felt bad because he looked hurt but I pretended not to see. \n\nI feel kind of bad now because talking to another friend i realized my friend has always had a crass sense of humor and i\u2019ve never told him anything bad about it so this probably came from nowhere and made me seem really sensitive. Idk i\u2019m kind of stubborn so I worry I should be saying sorry here but won\u2019t see it.

There's no joke or punchline. He's just embarrassing you by pointing out a fact that you asked him not to. He's being a dick and refusing to stop because he doesn't like being called out on his behavior. \n\nYou aren't responsible for his selfish and mean behavior, just because you didn't criticize him before this.

I don\u2019t think anyone would want people to know they are related to a dictator when they don\u2019t even know said dictator nor do they agree with their regime.

You all are having a nice time at a coffee house and suddenly they have to think about GreatUncleX going to a labor camp and having those thoughts going through their head for the rest of the day.  That's awful for all involved.

That's not a \"crass sense of humor\", that's sadistic shit-starting at your expense. Most likely doing it for the enjoyment of creating awkward situations. I don't know for sure who your great uncle is, but if he sent people to labor camps, he definitely may be bad enough to be in history books. What your friend is doing is not funny and is potentially dangerous. There's a good chance your friend is going to unknowingly put you into the crossfire of a very angry family member of a fallen victim, or a highly resentful survivor who may take their pain out on you, even if you never knew him. \n\nEither he cuts it out, or you cut him out. No negotiations. I'm sorry he put you through that.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" has no regard for the potential effects of his played out attempt at humor.

Maybe you should start telling people his uncle was a serial killer. NTA", "NTA your \u201cfriend\u201d is being a complete idiot with this.

This \"friend\" doesn't sound like a friend at all if he can't even do the Tier 1 friend thing of, I don't know, respecting you and your wishes? There is a difference between having a crass sense of humor and having absolutely no social skills or tact. It sounds like this guy has so much of both issues that he literally cannot control himself.\n\nDoing what he did even one time was immature, selfish, rude, disrespectful, and downright appalling, and then he went and compounded the issue by doing it over and over and over again. Drop him like a rancid sack of rotting meat.", "NTA\n\nA cursory google search would be enough to tell him why he should stop. Just lie and say that he's a racist and you have no idea what he's talking about. Clarify, not everyone from your country with the last name X is related to a murderer, and that you aren't all the same. People will be furious at him and he will be embarrassed. Alternatively, just keep doing what you're doing, and ignore him. He is way way way over the line.", "No. Uh uh. \u201cHe has a crass sense of humor\u201d isn\u2019t a birth defect, it\u2019s a character flaw. It comes dangerously close to the dreaded \u201cThat\u2019s just the way he is\u201d and I am on a single woman crusade to stamp that bullshit out. \n\nThe first time is a mistake. The second time, there needs to be a serious talk with a satisfactory resolution.  And there is no third time. This isn\u2019t funny. I have a relative who went to prison for life for SAing 25 Boy Scouts and I can\u2019t imagine people viewing me through those shit-covered goggles. And in your circumstance, if he said it to the wrong person, it could even be dangerous. \n\nHe\u2019s not your friend. Don\u2019t let people gaslight you into giving him a pass because he\u2019s an asshole and somehow they\u2019ve decided that his assholery is somehow different and okay. NTA", "NTA. Also, get rid of your friend!", "NTA. Drop this jackass from your life", "NTA and you didn't say it that bad", "Most adults would understand why this is a big deal. If you feel like this friend truly might not understand why you don't want this, make a time to discuss it with him. Explain the ramifications. Ask why he insists on making awkwardness and unpleasantness. Make him explain it. But then don't give him another chance.

But my family has lived in happiness and safety since moving. It sounds like you still live in the country where your great uncle hurt people, where there hasn\u2019t been the opportunity for people to heal or distance themselves from historical events.\n\nEvery time your friend brings this up, he\u2019s gambling on the hope that these people aren\u2019t going to turn violent. He\u2019s risking your physical safety, and he\u2019s an idiot for not recognizing that.
