Jackson was a wonderful sitter your kids loved. You trusted him with them in-person. Why do you not trust him with years-old pictures of a time when he did something really fun with them that demonstrates joy?\n\nThey're grown now. I understand how you feel, but on this you need to back down - and apologize to Jackson for jumping on this.", "ESH. Yes he should have asked permission before posting publicly, although since your sons are adults now it's really their permission he should have asked, not yours, so your message does smack a little of being overprotective. \nHowever, it was an asshole move from him not to reply to your private message but to *publicly* indirectly refer to you having issues with the photo. \nIt sounds like he needs a lesson on social media etiquette.", "YTA.

Your kids are adults now so I don\u2019t think you really have any say in what pictures of them exist online, if the sitter had to ask anyones permission it would be them not you but he\u2019s just sharing some pictures of them having fun not a big deal at all. Have you asked your kids if they have a problem with it? Cause now they\u2019re 18+ it\u2019s up to them  it\u2019s really not for you to say.", "I think it was a stretch for you to act like that instead of just enjoying the flashback.

YTA. \n\nPeople walk down the street and have no rights to privacy and are filmed everywhere that has security cameras and youre mad a lovely baby sitter posted pictures to their own social media about the people they interact with? Like its really not that deep. It's just a photo.", "YTA.  Are you within your rights to do this?  Maybe.  Are you the AH for being overprotective of these two grown men?  Absolutely.  It was 11 years ago, they formed an emotional attachment with there babysitter, enjoyed themselves for 6 YEARS, and now you are just being petty and very jealous.  Hope this put things into perspective.", "YTA for thinking he should ask your permission. I mean, it might\u2019ve been a good idea to ask the men themselves, but it\u2019s their permission to give, not their mother\u2019s.", "Soft YTA. While I get wanting privacy in this crazy digital age, you kids are adults and it\u2019s up to them to decide if they want pictures up on social media. I would have asked my kids if they were comfortable with the pictures first.", "YTA\n\nThere's an argument to be made that pictures of very young kids should only be posted with parental approval for safety (predators). Your kids are adults, and posting old photos of them as kids was not exposing them to risk. He was sharing a fun thing. \n\nYou are being controlling for no good reason. If your adult children object to the use of their image, it's their own place to communicate this. If your kids had posted this asking if he should have asked them, it would be different. Thinking he should have gone to their mother...unreasonable.", "YTA. \n\nIf they were still little kids and he posted this like right after that moment, I would've agreed, but they're adults now and he was just reminiscing on old times. If anything, he could've asked your kids for permission since it was photos of them, but either way, unless he has some super massive follower count it's not like those photos are even going anywhere or being seen by anyone important.", "INFO: How do your sons feel about this? At the end of the day, they are the ones whose opinions truly matter.\n\nHe absolutely should have asked but he should have asked them. It is 100% on them to determine what they are comfortable with. I get the concern-Kids photos online can be found and used by child predators but your sons are adults so the decision should fall to them.\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think Jackson\u2019s motivation was bad and he probably didn\u2019t even think about the potential implications but it really is good etiquette to ask before posting photos of others.\n\nESH.", "YTA.

It\u2019s a nice memory to have, and that he still remembered you & wanted you to share in that too.", "I'm going with NTA just because I think it should be completely expected to ask someone for permission to post their image on the Internet.

If so that's kinda weird, but in the end it's up to your sons.", "NTA - if the sitter wanted to share them he should have sent them to you, the parents which was his initial thoughts.  \n\n\nAs long as you asked him in a friendly manner I don't see any issue with your request for him to ask you for permission to post pictures of your children while they were children.", "ESH.

The reality of the world we live in is that any time we go out in public we are being photographed and recorded by countless sources, and we have very very limited rights to control what people do with those images.

Even minors.   \n\nI agree with most of the posters that even if someone should have been asked for permission here, it would be your sons since they\u2019re adults now. You have absolutely no ground to stand on to control images of them given that they\u2019re adults. But I don\u2019t even think Jackson necessarily should have had to ask them.

But to scold someone for posting long-ago pictures of kids who are now adults as part of a happy and wholesome memory makes me so sad. I loved all the great sitters my kids had, and if any of them posted long-ago pictures like this I would likely comment \"OMG what a precious memory! They loved you so much, you were the best babysitter EVER!!!\" just to remind him that we did appreciate what he did for our family even after all this time. The fact that you scolded him makes me so sad. For what -- \"privacy\"? Are you afraid someone is going to come kidnap your adult children from the play-center they were at 8 years ago? If they are on social media to be tagged, they clearly aren't freaked out about being overly exposed on social media. This makes no sense, I think you are likely mad about something else and taking it out on this guy.", "YTA", "YTA\n\n11 year old photos of events to which you were a participant are fair game for social media.", "Why would you expect him to ask you permission to post pictures of now adults?
