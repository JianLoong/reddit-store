After a while of chatting I set up a date to a fairy expensive restaurant. It\u2019s not like top of the line or anything, but it is a nice restaurant nonetheless. Anyway at the end of the date I ask her is she would want to go on another date sometime, to which she says yes. I did not find this surprising as I had a good time, and it seemed like she did as well. Fast forward to the next day. I sent her a text and I asked her if she would like to go on another date. She responded with a simple \u201cno\u201d. As you can imagine this caught me off guard as she had said the night before that she wanted to go on another date. Because of this I asked her why she didn\u2019t want to go. Her response was basically \u201cbecause i see you as a friend.\u201d \ud83d\udc94 Anyways the bill on the date was about $90 total. Her meal was about $60, and mine $30. Now I paid fully on the date. Personally I think the bill should be split, but since I had a bad experience on a previous date when I asked her to pay half the bill, that girl definitely did not like that. So on this date I told myself that I was going to pay for it. Now obviously I wasn\u2019t too happy when she said this, but then I got thinking. Friends typically pay for their meal. So I sent her my venmo and told her to pay me $45 (half the bill). She then asked me why, and I told her friends pay their fair share. She called me an asshole and blocked me. So I\u2019m writing this a few hours later and I am thinking that I might be in the wrong.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
