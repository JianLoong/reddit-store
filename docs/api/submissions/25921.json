He just hugged me for a long while, whispering sorry in my ears. When he pulled back I could see tears in his eyes. It melted any anger I had. And then he told me what happened. \n\nThe day before the argument, we had travelled from my place to his, 9 hour journey and reached after 1am. My husband woke at 7.30 AM and found both his parents cooking instead of just mom. Surprised he enquired about it and mom said it was cause they had invited his family from both sides to celebrate Onam with us. They were preparing food for Sadhya. (They have never done this before)\n\nHe asked why they didn't let us know this was the plan. They said it was obvious. DH joined in to help.\n\nAt this point, his mom started complaining about me. He told her we got here late and I was exhausted. She went on how that doens't matter and normal DILs would still work. He was trying to shrug it off as much as possible. By the time I was up, cooking was well underway. When I saw them in kitchen, I was surprised and asked something along the lines of \"It isn't finished yet?\". Referring to breakfast having no clue about Sadhya.\n\nShe started about how it will be finished since she has no help and how unlucky it is to have another women in the house who don't\u00a0 lift a finger to help.\n\nI told her we got in late and I just woke up. She said it doesn't matter and how a loving DIL would wake up early anyways. How she wishes my BIL atleast has enough sense to bring in someone better. \n\nThat was the last straw for DH. He asked me why I couldn't get up earlier for two days while we visit them. That's when everything escalated and I ended up leaving.\n\nHe couldn't leave after me, cause of invited guests. He couldn't get hold of me on phone and hence called my mom. Cue my parents calling me about over reacting.\n\nHe apologised for everything.He cannot imagine losing me and told his parents as much when he left.\n\nI told him I had no idea about Sadhya plans or guests coming and  apologised for not staying to discuss it. I also expressed how roof comment was disrespectful especially when I was invited. He apologised.\n\nI accept his apology but has made it clear it can't be this way anymore. I showed him the post and all the replies. He apologised again.\n\nI told him I have nothing against them. I just don't want to work on my weekends. Taking advice from the comments I suggested getting a maid if they need help.\n\nHe said they don't need help. They just want me specifically to help. And that he realises it's wrong and promised to stand up for me more.\n \nFrom now on we won't be staying over night at their place. Just lunch or dinner visit. Though preferably outside on neutral grounds or trips. \n\nHopefully it goes well. \n\nThankyou for all the responses. It gave us a lot to talk and think about.", "created_utc": 1693485100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1669vti/update_aita_for_not_waking_up_early_and_helping/", "score": 1073, "replies": ["It sounds like as positive an update as can be expected.\n\nGood on you for standing your ground.", "Actions speak louder than words.

He asked me why I couldn't get up earlier for two days while we visit them.\n\nSo, when he got the last straw... he berated *you*?\n\nWhat was \"his last straw\" after all? He didn't complain or get back to his mother for disrespecting you, he tagged along with her against you.\n\nAgain, for the people in the back: when his mother said \"she wishes BIL will bring in someone better\" than you, *your DH berates you instead of telling his mom this was an offensive and disrespectful thing to say, and he wouldn't have it*?\n\nI do hope he begins to stand up for you more, bc at this point it seems like he still has to learn how to do that.\n\nEdit: formatting", "NTA. So\u2026MIL\u2019s plans for Sadhya and guests were not passed on to you and your husband beforehand. Even when your Dh was informed that morning by his mother, it didn\u2019t occur to your husband \u201cIt\u2019s a trap, Captain Ackbar!\u201d  Your MIL wanted the subservience and service of a DIL that her culture has mandated, the service she most like gave her MIL. She thinks it\u2019s *her turn.*  Times change and sometimes change is hard. It\u2019s going take time for your DH to understand if he\u2019s not part of the change, of the solution,  he\u2019s part of the problem. Best wishes.", "I still don't understand why he turned on you and asked why you couldn't get up earlier to help. It doesn't make sense that he argued with you or that it was his last straw- his mother had been criticising you, and his response was to join in with the criticism when you came into the room? That doesn't sound like a man who was defending you before you arrived - sounds like his mother was criticising you, he was agreeing and then you walked in and he decided to have a go at you to show mummy dearest he was on her side. \n\nThere was absolutely no need for him to say what he did to you, regardless of whether the family was cooking for guests or whether you made an off hand comment that was misunderstood. I don't understand why your anger melted away, as his explanation actually made me angrier on your behalf. \n\nWell done for refusing to spend extended weekends with then anymore but I wouldn't be giving up 9 hours of my day to spend any time with them - your husband can see them on his own. And I would seriously be digging a bit deeper into his behaviour - he's clearly not as committed to challenging the sexism and misogyny of your culture as he claims. He says what you want to hear when you're alone together, and he said what his mother wanted to hear when he was in front of her. That isn't equal partnership, that's a man without a backbone.", "I hope your husband steps up in the next opportunity. He let you down. Sounds like you have a good plan going forward and enforcing boundaries. Best of luck to you OP.", "I am very proud of you for standing your ground! I am African and this part of our cultures are very similar...traditionally it is our jobs as DIL to wake up and do the job while everyone else sits and waits to judge the work you do. Every time my mom goes I'm teaching you to wake up early because what will you do at your MIL's when you get married I want to cringe. I've never told her but it is one of the biggest reasons I don't want to be married at all so good for you OP\ud83d\udc4f", "He even said they don\u2019t want help.

My husbands family is very traditional/Italian. Love them to pieces, best family I could ever ask to be part of, except Sunday dinner with aunts/uncles/grandparents/cousins. The women do all the cooking and cleaning. It\u2019s a whole thing\u2026every week. Both my husband and I have demanding careers, he does really well, and I\u2019m the bread winner. Not a pissing contest, but we are both exhausted come Sunday, and I don\u2019t want to spend all day helping, serving, cleaning while the men sit around. Especially considering I\u2019ve had 3 of 8 major knee surgeries over the past few years, on and off septic, worked through it, I\u2019m wiped out. I told my husband how I felt, he said then just don\u2019t do it. But that\u2019s awkward when the women are all up doing things and I just want to sit a minute with my leg up icing it. Plus Sunday is catch up day for our house, mamas boy sucks at chores (love him but drives me nuts). So I said well then I\u2019m not coming, I love your family but I need a break too, I need to get ready for the week, I have horses and animals to tend to. Finally he agreed my take on it made sense. So he started helping.

Instead he chose to \u201csave face\u201d and stay FOR HIS PARENTS instead of you. \n\nHis whispering sorry in your ear doesn\u2019t prove squat. He needs to show with ACTION AND WORDS. You said \u201che shrugged it off\u201d when his own mother was complaining about you. That\u2019s awful.", "They said they are hoping BIL to being someone BETTER? And your DH yelled at you instead of them?\n\nOuch!", "It seems like your MIL wants 100% of your husband\u2019s attention. Parties that she had not mentioned? Bad-mouthing you to him for contrived reasons?

That\u2019s a value of his love. I hope he makes it more valuable but love like his is easy to find.", "He\u2019s probably going to do it again, especially now that he knows all he has to do is cry a little to get away with it. But hopefully he miraculously changes.", "Your husband lied to you about respecting your equality", "Why didn\u2019t ANYone tell her guests were coming??  That would have changed my attitude.

If only they communicated better about the event they\u2019re having, and maybe asked you nicely to help because of the event, maybe things could have gone better than the way it did.\n\nAbout not needing maid but still wanting you to help, I think of it as one of their love languages: act of service. Maybe they see you helping as a sign that you care about them. If it\u2019s not your love language, it\u2019s fair that you don\u2019t want to do it. My mom\u2019s love language is also very different than mine, so I understand how it feels like a burden sometimes. But it\u2019s just a thought. It\u2019s not that they need you to slave away. Maybe they just think of it as a proof that you care about them.", "So they had BIG HOLIDAY PLANS and just didn't tell anyone because it was \"obvious.\" Did DH grow up having big celebrations for this holiday and it just slipped his mind? Does not one else have a holiday calendar? When DH found out it was a BIG HOLIDAY CELEBRATION with invited guests, why didn't he go and tell his wife? What you wear to just hang out with ILs might not be what you wanted to wear for a specific holiday. \n\nPutting boundaries on visits is a good idea.

He knew you were unaware of everything, and even tried to talk to his parents about how late you guys came in. But then, when his mom attacked you and push came to shove, he completely flipped and blamed you with his parents. \n\nSo now you guys are resorting to just limiting contact with his parents, because apparently if he has too much contact with them he\u2019ll flip on you again.", "What the hell is a DH?", "Fellow Malayali here - proud that you stood your ground, and I don't think this is cause for scorched earth like other commenters are adding. \n\nThe social pressure and expectations are different and it seems like your husband will be better about having your back.

This is life. As far as I am concerned, he doens't need to pick or choose. I will live my life and not let them into mine. My husband shares my life and will go visit his parents or be there for him. \n\nIf they ask him to pick a side, that's not my issue. I will never ask him to pick a side. Their issue is with me.

You compromise. You see that there are extreme cultural differences and not everything can be viewed through a Western lens.

Could it have been his parents turning all the negativity onto him once his wife left?

Iirc, OP and her family are from India, with very different culture and expectations. That her husband took her side, even if a bit late, is a very big win.", "I mean, cultural context matters in the sense of informing people, but it doesn\u2019t mean that people should advocate for values that they find morally wrong.

I was shocked he would do that.", "Okay I agree entirely here with this clarification.  I think you're getting a lot of pushback because so much of AITA/advice Reddit will take the assumptive next line after \"Him coming home in tears doesn't negate the fact that he didn't take up for you when it counted.\" as \"Therefore, dump him, no matter what.\" and not \"Therefore, make sure the actions that follow back up the words.\"\n\nEdit: \"no matter what\"", "I would be annoyed as well if my guest would stumble out of bed late and then ask why breakfast still isn't ready.\n\nAnd if I stayed at my MIL and she had invited guests I would and in fact have helped her prepare.\n\nShe would tell me beforehand and let me sleep in though and it would be just working together in a friendly atmosphere.\n\nBut I would not say that I \"don't work at weekends\" and refuse to lift a finger and suggest they get a maid if they need help. I would consider that very rude. I'm from a white Western European culture by the way.\n\nBut everyone seems to think that's ok and are on OPs side.

I would never make my wife choose between me and her dad(divorced parents)  but she know I also wouldn't swat a mosquito and watch him get bit.

Yes, relationships require that kind of consideration.\n\nI've been having a small rough patch with my sweetie and yesterday we still had to work on something, together, and when he made me laugh I said \"stop it.

She most likely wanted to be able to hold that over OP, that she didn't wake up early even for a special occasion.\n\nOP also never meant to not help.
