He just hugged me for a long while, whispering sorry in my ears. When he pulled back I could see tears in his eyes. It melted any anger I had. And then he told me what happened. \n\nThe day before the argument, we had travelled from my place to his, 9 hour journey and reached after 1am. My husband woke at 7.30 AM and found both his parents cooking instead of just mom. Surprised he enquired about it and mom said it was cause they had invited his family from both sides to celebrate Onam with us. They were preparing food for Sadhya. (They have never done this before)\n\nHe asked why they didn't let us know this was the plan. They said it was obvious. DH joined in to help.\n\nAt this point, his mom started complaining about me. He told her we got here late and I was exhausted. She went on how that doens't matter and normal DILs would still work. He was trying to shrug it off as much as possible. By the time I was up, cooking was well underway. When I saw them in kitchen, I was surprised and asked something along the lines of \"It isn't finished yet?\". Referring to breakfast having no clue about Sadhya.\n\nShe started about how it will be finished since she has no help and how unlucky it is to have another women in the house who don't\u00a0 lift a finger to help.\n\nI told her we got in late and I just woke up. She said it doesn't matter and how a loving DIL would wake up early anyways. How she wishes my BIL atleast has enough sense to bring in someone better. \n\nThat was the last straw for DH. He asked me why I couldn't get up earlier for two days while we visit them. That's when everything escalated and I ended up leaving.\n\nHe couldn't leave after me, cause of invited guests. He couldn't get hold of me on phone and hence called my mom. Cue my parents calling me about over reacting.\n\nHe apologised for everything.He cannot imagine losing me and told his parents as much when he left.\n\nI told him I had no idea about Sadhya plans or guests coming and  apologised for not staying to discuss it. I also expressed how roof comment was disrespectful especially when I was invited. He apologised.\n\nI accept his apology but has made it clear it can't be this way anymore. I showed him the post and all the replies. He apologised again.\n\nI told him I have nothing against them. I just don't want to work on my weekends. Taking advice from the comments I suggested getting a maid if they need help.\n\nHe said they don't need help. They just want me specifically to help. And that he realises it's wrong and promised to stand up for me more.\n \nFrom now on we won't be staying over night at their place. Just lunch or dinner visit. Though preferably outside on neutral grounds or trips. \n\nHopefully it goes well. \n\nThankyou for all the responses. It gave us a lot to talk and think about.", "created_utc": 1693485100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1669vti/update_aita_for_not_waking_up_early_and_helping/", "score": 2441, "replies": ["It sounds like as positive an update as can be expected.\n\nGood on you for standing your ground.", "Actions speak louder than words.

How she wishes my BIL atleast has enough sense to bring in someone better.  \n>  \n>That was the last straw for DH. He asked me why I couldn't get up earlier for two days while we visit them.\n\nSo, when he got the last straw... he berated *you*?\n\nWhat was \"his last straw\" after all? He didn't complain or get back to his mother for disrespecting you, he tagged along with her against you.\n\nAgain, for the people in the back: when his mother said \"she wishes BIL will bring in someone better\" than you, *your DH berates you instead of telling his mom this was an offensive and disrespectful thing to say, and he wouldn't have it*?\n\nI do hope he begins to stand up for you more, bc at this point it seems like he still has to learn how to do that.\n\nEdit: formatting", "NTA. So\u2026MIL\u2019s plans for Sadhya and guests were not passed on to you and your husband beforehand. Even when your Dh was informed that morning by his mother, it didn\u2019t occur to your husband \u201cIt\u2019s a trap, Captain Ackbar!\u201d  Your MIL wanted the subservience and service of a DIL that her culture has mandated, the service she most like gave her MIL. She thinks it\u2019s *her turn.*  Times change and sometimes change is hard. It\u2019s going take time for your DH to understand if he\u2019s not part of the change, of the solution,  he\u2019s part of the problem. Best wishes.", "I still don't understand why he turned on you and asked why you couldn't get up earlier to help. It doesn't make sense that he argued with you or that it was his last straw- his mother had been criticising you, and his response was to join in with the criticism when you came into the room? That doesn't sound like a man who was defending you before you arrived - sounds like his mother was criticising you, he was agreeing and then you walked in and he decided to have a go at you to show mummy dearest he was on her side. \n\nThere was absolutely no need for him to say what he did to you, regardless of whether the family was cooking for guests or whether you made an off hand comment that was misunderstood. I don't understand why your anger melted away, as his explanation actually made me angrier on your behalf. \n\nWell done for refusing to spend extended weekends with then anymore but I wouldn't be giving up 9 hours of my day to spend any time with them - your husband can see them on his own. And I would seriously be digging a bit deeper into his behaviour - he's clearly not as committed to challenging the sexism and misogyny of your culture as he claims. He says what you want to hear when you're alone together, and he said what his mother wanted to hear when he was in front of her. That isn't equal partnership, that's a man without a backbone.", "I hope your husband steps up in the next opportunity. He let you down. Sounds like you have a good plan going forward and enforcing boundaries. Best of luck to you OP.", "I am very proud of you for standing your ground! I am African and this part of our cultures are very similar...traditionally it is our jobs as DIL to wake up and do the job while everyone else sits and waits to judge the work you do. Every time my mom goes I'm teaching you to wake up early because what will you do at your MIL's when you get married I want to cringe. I've never told her but it is one of the biggest reasons I don't want to be married at all so good for you OP\ud83d\udc4f", "He even said they don\u2019t want help.

My husbands family is very traditional/Italian. Love them to pieces, best family I could ever ask to be part of, except Sunday dinner with aunts/uncles/grandparents/cousins. The women do all the cooking and cleaning. It\u2019s a whole thing\u2026every week. Both my husband and I have demanding careers, he does really well, and I\u2019m the bread winner. Not a pissing contest, but we are both exhausted come Sunday, and I don\u2019t want to spend all day helping, serving, cleaning while the men sit around. Especially considering I\u2019ve had 3 of 8 major knee surgeries over the past few years, on and off septic, worked through it, I\u2019m wiped out. I told my husband how I felt, he said then just don\u2019t do it. But that\u2019s awkward when the women are all up doing things and I just want to sit a minute with my leg up icing it. Plus Sunday is catch up day for our house, mamas boy sucks at chores (love him but drives me nuts). So I said well then I\u2019m not coming, I love your family but I need a break too, I need to get ready for the week, I have horses and animals to tend to. Finally he agreed my take on it made sense. So he started helping.

Instead he chose to \u201csave face\u201d and stay FOR HIS PARENTS instead of you. \n\nHis whispering sorry in your ear doesn\u2019t prove squat. He needs to show with ACTION AND WORDS.

And your DH yelled at you instead of them?\n\nOuch!", "It seems like your MIL wants 100% of your husband\u2019s attention. Parties that she had not mentioned?

But hopefully he miraculously changes.", "Your husband lied to you about respecting your equality", "Why didn\u2019t ANYone tell her guests were coming??  That would have changed my attitude.

If only they communicated better about the event they\u2019re having, and maybe asked you nicely to help because of the event, maybe things could have gone better than the way it did.\n\nAbout not needing maid but still wanting you to help, I think of it as one of their love languages: act of service. Maybe they see you helping as a sign that you care about them. If it\u2019s not your love language, it\u2019s fair that you don\u2019t want to do it. My mom\u2019s love language is also very different than mine, so I understand how it feels like a burden sometimes. But it\u2019s just a thought. It\u2019s not that they need you to slave away. Maybe they just think of it as a proof that you care about them.", "So they had BIG HOLIDAY PLANS and just didn't tell anyone because it was \"obvious.\" Did DH grow up having big celebrations for this holiday and it just slipped his mind? Does not one else have a holiday calendar? When DH found out it was a BIG HOLIDAY CELEBRATION with invited guests, why didn't he go and tell his wife? What you wear to just hang out with ILs might not be what you wanted to wear for a specific holiday. \n\nPutting boundaries on visits is a good idea.

But then, when his mom attacked you and push came to shove, he completely flipped and blamed you with his parents. \n\nSo now you guys are resorting to just limiting contact with his parents, because apparently if he has too much contact with them he\u2019ll flip on you again.", "[deleted]", "Fellow Malayali here - proud that you stood your ground, and I don't think this is cause for scorched earth like other commenters are adding. \n\nThe social pressure and expectations are different and it seems like your husband will be better about having your back.

And god forbid you choose to stay in a hotel just to avoid the implied obligations of waking up early, etc. There couldn\u2019t be a bigger affront to their honor, it would seem like. \n\nMy wife and I, we like to sleep in late on the weekends, so go hang us for that. We have earned our right to sleep as long as we need to by the hours we work during the week (not that we need a justification).

Almost makes it sound like OP is a bad habit, an addiction that he cannot shake. \n\nThe correct message he should be sending to his parents is that OP has earned the right to sleep as long as she needs to, that they\u2019re at the in-laws place by invitation and if their lifestyle was so onerous for them, they could as easily not visit or stay at a hotel. Why didn\u2019t the parents start off with \u201chey, it\u2019s Onam. Let\u2019s have a banquet as a family, but we all will need to pitch in to make it a success\u201d a week or so before said trip? It was because they wanted OP to fail a test that she didn\u2019t know she was taking, the criticize, berate, denigrate and manipulate her into submission. Good old fashioned emotional abuse. \n\nI was in the almost same situation, with my mother complaining about my wife not waking up early enough to make sure all her guests (I.e., my parents) were\u201d taken care of\u201d. And mind you, this is after wifey was already waking up at 7 am on weekends (ie at least 3 hours earlier than the norm on the weekends) because my parents were visiting. \n\nI responded by saying (half jokingly, half sarcastically) that I much prefer having a working wife who brings in the money to the joint account and pay someone to cook and clean, rather than have my wife cook and clean all home like a dutiful DIL. I further went on to add (again, sarcastically of course) that anyone who messed with my \u201ccash cow\u201d /s and affected her heath, peace of mind or anything else directly related to the funds going into my bank account would face the brunt of my wrath. Nervous chuckles all around, but the message was understood. \n\n(My mom tried talking about how she had worked in a Fortune 500 company all her life and managed her family, but conveniently left out the fact that Dad used cook the morning meals before leaving for work and we had a live-in maid back in the old country. You can only get so far with some people\u2026(sigh))\n\nAlso, earlier I probably sounded like the house guest from hell but I\u2019d like to clarify; whenever we visit to stay with anyone, our goal is to always leave them with a net gain of time and effort for our hosts. We sleep in their guest bedroom a couple of days? We make sure we tidy up that bedroom and leave it cleaner than when we came in. Kids playing together leaving the floor a mess? We clean it up. Breakfast? We make our own and if someone else is waiting, make for them as well.

Where is the proof that next time his mother makes a demand of you, he will shut it down immediately rather than let it escalate to the point where he tries to tell you what you should do?", "Man, lot of people here aren't cutting any slack. I'll add in another vote for the other side: congrats on things working out much better than they might have. Sounds like your husband in the moment didn't stand up for you (and actively undermined you) but it also sounds like it was a heat of the moment thing, and he's backing you up now.  \n\n\nChanging culture is very hard. I was raised conservative Christian, and while it's a very different circumstance from yours, I know a little bit at least about how hard 'deprogramming' can be. For you, for your husband, for his parents, for your parents. Congrats on finding a man from your culture that's trying to change things with you as an equal partner. That's awesome that he's going to make the big change with you and not going to go spend the night at his parent's house any more. Good luck going forward from here, sounds like you and your husband are moving in a good direction together. I hope it continues to build in a good way and that you can both fully move on from this.", "He hates hearing shit talked about you, so he berated you instead of his mother? OP, please read that out loud to yourself, or imagine a close friend justifying her husband's behaviour using those same words. \n\nIf I heard my mother taunting my partner (or indeed anyone), a) it wouldn't have lasted 2 hours, I'd have shut it down ASAP and b) when my partner arrived in the room and my mother started taunting them, I'd defend my partner, not join in. \n\nI remind you - your MIL said she hoped her other son would bring a better wife home, and your husband responded by telling you to get up earlier. He didn't tell his mother to back off, or cut it out, or say 'nobody could be better than my wife' - HE TOLD YOU THAT YES, YOU SHOULD GET UP EARLIER AND HELP HER. \n\nHe then let you leave, called your mother, gave her a one sided story so she also criticised you, then came home, cried and manipulated you into forgiveness. \n\nHe isn't as wonderful as you think he is.", "I understand, completely. Just think MIL could have been up front with you. \ud83e\ude77", "I do wonder about pressure to change which may happen if you have kids. And also what your possible future kids may hear if hubby takes them to visit grandparents alone. But it does sound like a win.", "Most sane redditor take.", "That's a vvery bad take. OP's right, there's nothing to gain (for now) in asking husband to cut off his family.\n\nI kinda of agree with you that, in a couple of years, it'll become necessary. Because husband's family is just shit. But for now this is a resonating win and should be taken as that.", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from completely. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t your husband stand up for you?\u201d is such a common refrain on AITA Reddit from people who (I at least assume) don\u2019t have your history, so without the additional context, I was responding to your comment at face value and offering an additional perspective. All the best to you and yours~ \ud83e\udec2", "These people have zero clue of the inner workings of an eastern world family dynamic. That shit just doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m Eastern European, my husband is Indian. His mom is psycho but we can\u2019t just cut her off. Life isn\u2019t that simple. We\u2019re super lucky to live far away. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s our solution. When I posted about her in MIL subs they immediately jumped to \u201cGO NC!\u201d That may fly in the western world but not where we\u2019re from. Sorry! Unless she tried something like murdering one of us, it just wouldn\u2019t happen.", "Except he began to defend his mother and be angry at his wife only after she said something misogynistic, instead of just explaining to his wife the information he knew she didn\u2019t know, because he had just learned it! Reducing that to a simple \u201cwhat, you never bowed social pressure?\u201d is disingenuous. He was mad his wife wouldn\u2019t make him look good by bowing to his family\u2019s sexist expectations.", "Hell my husband (and I) let his family treat me like shit for 40 years and I still forgave him when we both came to our senses.   I\u2019d give OP\u2019s husband one chance and if he caved again I\u2019d kick him to the curb with the rest of the trash.", "You deserve better OP", "We've all caved to it, but most of us to minor stuff at worst. Caring more about your parents looking bad than your life partner leaving you is nobodies fault but your own. Someone that spineless should never date again and die alone so actual decent people dont have to deal with them", "I've never bowed to anything that would lose me something I consider important.  In case you haven't realized, it's 2023, and this whole \"I'm sheltered from the world\" excuse is completely and utter trash.  With the prominence of internet, you have 0 excuse to not have context to have a spine.", "I DON'T WANT A SOLUTION! I WANT TO BE MAD!", "Oh they'll twist reality into a mobius strip if it supports a woman.\n\nThe way some women post here can make red pillers almost seem justified. Fortunately out in the real world people aren't so toxic.", "Well those cultural standards fuckin suck, so they remain NTA in reality.", "Agreed, I guess time will tell", "Reddit advice subs remind me of when you get a social circle that starts accumulating bitter middle aged divorced folks, and they're suddenly pressuring everyone else to divorce.", "At least hitting the gym and going to therapy aint bad advice in an upon itself. :)", "Congratulations and being healthier and more well adjusted then 90% of the posters on this subreddit!\n\nKeep on being amazing!", "I agr\u00e9e with you. Indian myself, I also knew there was no way I was going to be the perfect Indian \u201cbahu\u201d. \nIn order to live like a normal human person, you need a husband with a spine of steel.

Let him go alone and meet with them to a restaurant etc to eat/spend  time together out of their house.", "What a great outlook! It reminds me in a strange way of what my contracts professor told once, \"Sometimes public relations is more important than winning, even when you are right.\" \n\nYou are so right, they may be nicer to you on the surface but forcing some arbitrary choice will only cause resentment with them which could bleed to your husband. As long as you have boundaries and remain strong, I think you will find your Husband will begin deconstructing those ideas he grew up with and choose you in those situations going forward without an ultimatum.", "You're a good wife!", "This makes me very happy and I'm very happy for you that the situation ended the way it ended.", "I just want to say that I didn't mean your relationship was a lost cause at all. I hope this blows over, and that he stands by his words. Best of luck. I truly mean that.", "Thank you. I only meant it would take a lot for me personally to get back to  where I was  before this happened.  I made sure not to put anything about ending the relationship. Still caught hell for it anyway.", "Thank you, and best to you and yours too!", "99% have already cut off their families, too.", "Every commenter like the ones above is just projecting the parts of life where they felt like they failed onto the OP.", "To be honest whenever I see someone posting saying they are from certain cultures and religion, I cringe because the response they will get is not going to reflect the reality of the community/society that they live in. Telling teens to argue back and behave like a western kid can in the US with little consequence can risk making an Indian kid\u2019s life so much worse. Same thing with adults who are surrounded by family and friends and coworkers who don\u2019t have the western mindset. Following the kinds of advice given here can be really harmful and in some cases dangerous.", "\n\n>Unless she tried something like murdering one of us, it just wouldn\u2019t happen\n\nCome on.

The cultural divide between the east and west is too wide for most western advice to be applicable to families of eastern culture. Maybe there are some Indian people who\u2019ve gone NC with parents but by and large the familial bonds and culture itself is different in the east.

Please read the original post and comments. \n\nOur agreement before marriage was I would never even go there. They begged, pleaded and guilt tripped me to visit.
