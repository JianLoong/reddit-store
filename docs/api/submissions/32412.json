NTA.\n\nEven if SIL did agree to FaceTime, it\u2019s not a problem for you to defend her. People in labor are very vulnerable, so even if your efforts weren\u2019t needed, it\u2019s still a nice gesture. \n\nLike when some other woman tells you that there\u2019s a creep checking you out and you look over to see your boyfriend. She might\u2019ve been wrong but I love that she was looking out for me.", "NTA\n\nI am a man and can't imagine how violated I would feel in the SIL's position if someone started facetiming while I was giving birth. Like, literally can't even comprehend how bad that would be. \n\nGood on you for standing up for her.", "NTA, even if SIL had previously agreed to Facetime, nothing wrong with you standing up for her in a vulnerable moment, especially as from the convo it sounded like Facetiming at the birth was a spontaneous decision. Your response may have been a bit intense, but in the heat of the moment understandable", "NTA. Just no MIL reddit is full of stories where people feel pressured by MIL to agree to something but they don't want it or change their minds in the the moment. Even if she did agree beforehand she may not have agreed once the reality of labor set in.", "NTA. \"that she and my brother had already discussed doing this\" and where was SIL in that discussion? If your mom meant to facetime after, then she could have clarified that to you all in the group chat. There was zero need for your dad to get all prissy.", "NTA you said absolutely not unless SIL agreed. Props to you I wish you were my SIL!", "Absolutely NTA. Your SIL is lucky to have you.", "God no, NTA.\n\nBut I\u2019m nosey, can you update us with your SIL\u2019s side of things, please?", "NTA at all! I want my mom and my partner there and that\u2019s it. I couldn\u2019t imagine a camera being held exposing me to more people while giving birth. Everyone can see the baby I just pushed out when I\u2019m ready.", "FaceTime so the Dad can be distracted holding the phone where your Mom can see\ud83e\udd74. If they really wanted your mom to be a part of it they would have asked her there. They probably just agreed(if they did) to be polite. I don\u2019t want my MIL on FaceTime when I\u2019m pushing a baby out. NTA.", "NTA, you were just doing your part having your SIL\u2019a back. Even if she did agree to it, I\u2019m sure she would appreciate you speaking up for her when she clearly wasn\u2019t able to in the moment. At the end of the day, it\u2019s not your mother or your father or your brother pushing out the baby, so they do not have a say in the matter. Good on you.", "NTA. Emotions were high and I kind of love that your defense was so strong! I'd be delighted if I was your SIL. If it turns out she did agree to FaceTime, then she knows you have her back. And your parents should be able to understand how the request looked in the chat. I mean sheesh, it looked wild.", "NTA at all.", "NTA even outside the egregious boundary violations to your SIL, your brother needed to be focused on his wife and child in that moment, not holding a phone or talking to his mother. I\u2019m appalled that either of them would think that\u2019s ok.", "If I were your SIL I would be so thankful for your consideration!  I have to wonder why the dad was busy chatting instead of focused on the imminent birth of their child and supporting their partner.\n\nNTA and may be the hero of the story.", "NTA\n\nOP, I think you're the angel in this scenario to be honest. I just gave birth and I'm a lot more quiet and private like your SIL. I had to stand up to my in laws a lot because they were constantly trying to come to the delivery and then wanting to be at the hospital immediately after even though I was a mess and needed a minute to bond with baby and regroup. \nAll I'm saying is I'd love it if I had a SIL like you standing up for me when I'm vulnerable like that (especially if I'm not part of the conversation). Maybe SIL did agree to FaceTime but you're right to call this pushy behavior out and ensure she's being respected and given as much space as she wants.", "I feel that if it had been previously agreed with SIL that your brother would\u2019ve just texted your mom or just called her - why put it in the group chat? Of if he put it there with the intention of calling your mom after why did she need to respond in all caps like that if it had already been planned? She could\u2019ve texted him privately, or just face timed him herself.\n\nI know it\u2019s just speculation but the clues lead me to believe they may not have had SIL\u2019s permission.\n\nBut either way, NTA. Because even if it was previously agreed upon, you didn\u2019t know and you were sticking up for your SIL. If I were your brother and it had been prearranged I would\u2019ve just responded \u201cthank you for looking out for Wife, however, the three of us agreed on this face time ahead of time\u201d instead of snapping at you. Their reactions are what make me suspicious of them tbh.\n\n& it is so inappropriate to ask that all, I feel. Like wtf. But that\u2019s just my personal opinion.", "NTA it's bizarre that she would even ask that. It's a vulnerable private moment no one should even this. If your SIL agreed I still say NTA because you were looking out and didn't know. You weren't rude either so nothing to apologize for. But truthfully asking to video while someone is pushing is bizarre.", "Nta good for you defending her", "NTA.\n\nYou win the SIL of the week award.  I seriously doubt SIL would have agreed with this, and you had her back.  I have a disturbing feeling your brother and Mom may have had this planned and always intended to give her a front-row seat whether your SIL liked it or not.  To do this when she's at her most vulnerable and unable to advocate for herself is disgusting.", "NTA.\n\nWow. Just wow.", "NTA.", "Nta", "NTA there are so many women who don\u2019t want their husbands with them\u2026 MIL is beyond entitled", "NTA. even if SIL agreed *before* that does not mean she agrees *in the moment.*\n\nIt's always best to verify *again* especially during something as volatile as childbirth in a supportive way. that means if she did say turn it off as she was pushing & her husband & MIL got angry because she agreed beforehand, that's an immediate fuck them in my book. \n\nAnd some hospitals don't even *let* you video/FT during pushing for a reason lol.", "NTA", "This is an unbelievable request. Your brother's focus should have been on his partner and the birth of his child, not pandering to his mother's wants. And as a woman who (I am assuming) has given birth she should certainly know better.   \n\nIf my husband had pulled this stunt I would have kicked him out of more than the labour ward. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHonestly, your brother is a huge AH. He should have been supporting his wife. He should not have been posting updates on his wife\u2019s cervix for all of his relatives.", "NTA. I would honestly have been mad if my husband was texting his mom regular updates on the size of my cervix. Wtf", "Who has time for that? He was about to miss his child birth to text with you people while his wife was in horrible pain and pressing his child out. \n\nHe is an idiot and I am glad  that you defended SIL", "NTA! I had the exact same reaction to reading this. Honestly, sounds like maybe your SIL was \u201cconvinced\u201d to do this during her delivery which is what I\u2019ve read a lot these days since I\u2019m giving birth soon myself. Due to her being quiet and shy, I doubt she honestly wanted to do it and just relented. Good on you for having her back. Childbirth is not a spectator sport! Leave the mommas alone! lol", "NTA.\n\n> she and my brother had already discussed doing this\n\nThat's nice, that was *before*. Consent *can* be revoked. \n\n>and that it wouldn\u2019t be during the actual delivery of the baby but afterwards.\n\nThen why was she demanding FaceTime *during*? Why not just openly clarify this instead of turning it into shady family drama? \n\n>If it didn\u2019t come as an unprompted offer directly from SIL, it\u2019s incredibly inappropriate for anyone else to ask\n\nThis is important. If SIL didn't *offer* this *freely*, then it was a horribly gauche request. It is not uncommon for women to feel pressured into agreeing to things to stay in their MILs favor, there is no harm in double checking the situation.\n\nEdit for typo", "Hell no, NTA. These are the times I wish Facetime didn\u2019t exist because some people cannot handle having 24/7 visual access to things. My mom also asked for facetime when i was in labor and we told her the hospital had a strict no video policy (which they did). Good on you for standing up for her.", "NTA FaceTime during a delivery is just not right and the fact that your brother didn't do it proves your point.", "NTA. If she agreed, still wanted to to do it, and circumstances allowed it then they would initiate the FT. Your mom is overstepping, and she knows it. That\u2019s why she got upset enough for your dad to hop in!", "Easiest NTA ever!!!", "Your mom sounds entitled and overbearing. NTA", "NTA. Glad somebody in your family was born with brains", "NTA\nYour SIL will thank you. Thank you for standing up for her!", "NTA", "nta. you're wonderful for standing up for your SIL", "NTA. Your SIL will be grateful for your intervention. If she wants to post videos, that\u2019s her choice, but you had her covered during a vulnerable moment. Women sometimes shit themselves when pushing. FaceTime when the baby is handed to the mother if she\u2019s willing. Not a second sooner.", "Nta. \nIt is very inapropriate and if she wanted her MIL there to watch she probably would have her there.", "NTA and if even if she had agreed before hand, she has the right to change her mind in the moment and your brother should have double checked that it's ok.\nAn agreement to facetime while pushing a watermelon out of your lady bits is not binding.", "NTA! Your SIL is so lucky to have you. MILs tend to not respect boundaries at all", "NTA you\u2019re a good SIL", "You\u2019re so NTA. Was your sister in law even on board with the pre \u201cFACETIME!\u201d discussion? Maybe I\u2019m uptight, but I would not be okay with my in-laws chatting about the state of my cervix.", "NTA and regardless of what SIL actually did or or didn\u2019t agree to or whatever arrangement your brother and mother had, you did the right thing. You stepped in to advocate for someone who probably was not able to advocate for herself in the moment. \n\nThe idea that anyone would expect a FaceTime during labor is honestly bonkers.", "NTA. As a very private person myself who recently gave birth, you are awesome for jumping on the defense like that, and I would be so grateful to have you as a SIL if I was in that position. Tbh I don\u2019t really care if you seemed mean or not but that\u2019s just me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f If your mom was supposed to FaceTime after the delivery then why did she type in all caps \u201cFACETIME\u201d right as she found out your SIL was pushing?? Obviously seems like she wanted to watch the birth. If that was me and I found out another family member other than my husband and hospital staff was watching me give birth I would be completely traumatized.", "NTA, OP. \n\nYou stood up for someone who didn\u2019t have the ability to stand up for herself, and I\u2019m glad that you did. \n\nI hate FaceTime in the best of times: giving birth would not be considered a \u201cbest time\u201d. \n\nAnd even if your mom did mean afterward, it\u2019s pushy and demanding to remind your brother at that very moment. If it was something they had agreed upon, he\u2019d FaceTime her afterward. I don\u2019t see that you did anything wrong at all here.", "NTA and honestly I find it really strange that your mom would make that request in the first place.", "Your mom is a narcissist.   Plan accordingly.  NTA.", "NTA. You were standing up for your SIL when she was in a vulnerable position, and if your mom and SIL had already prearranged the FaceTime, that doesn't negate the fact that you were protecting your SIL.", "NTA-  dad should be focusing on the woman giving birth,  not updating mommy dearest. \n\nI have a feeling that SIL is gonna be really happy you stopped this.", "NTA. As someone who has been married 14 years, I would give anything for a SIL like you. My SIL has always just ganged up on me along with MIL. You, however, you stood up for and protected your SIL as if she were a blood sibling. That is something to treasure. Mom and Dad can and should get over it. I don't understand what was so wrong with what you said anyway. It's not like you personally insulted or disrespected your mother. You simply said something she was doing seemed inappropriate. Are we not able to communicate honestly with our family? Mom needs to check her ego, take a breath and look at what was actually said. Nothing horrible, even if SIL had OKd this.", "Your brother is the AH.  He is there to support his wife, not to provide the evening entertainment for his mother.", "NTA I am just baffled, baffled by how many women who feel the need to lock a door in a stall in a public bathroom because god forbid someone get a glimpse of their skin below the waist suddenly think it is just fine and dandy to want to watch their daughter in law push a baby out of their genitals. None of those same women would invite their daughter in law to their own OB-GYN appointment, not would they accompany DIL to hers. But a baby? Ooh let me watch! MIL is an AH", "Did your SIL agree to it or not?  If no, N T A.  If yes, Y T A. \n\nIt's all about SIL giving consent a head of time.", "YTA I understand defending your SIL but also this isn\u2019t your battle to fight.

It sounds like it was just a general reminder to FaceTime once the baby was there.  If you wanted to get in the middle of it you should have at least clarified what she was asking for before jumping to your SIL' s defense.", "Not sure why you got involved at all", "Honestly you wasted your time most hospitals banned videos and photos during labor. If your mom and brother had already discussed it. \n\nMy recommendation is if you don\u2019t know what was discussed before don\u2019t jump into conclusions. Your mom has a right to be excited.

We both texted the group chat when my water broke and while waiting in the L&D triage (my text was just \u201ccan I get an epidural yet\u201d which was a running joke the whole pregnancy.) Husband then updated when I was getting close (8cm) but I ended up going from 8 to 10 and crowning in 2 minutes. She was having trouble breathing after being born (in just 3 pushes!!) Neither of us updated while this was happening because we were both holding our own breath (and I was delivering the placenta\u2026.)

It was during the pandemic too.", "I mean, when I was in labor and it was time to push I told my husband \u201ctext my mom and tell her\u201d. She was on her way to the hospital though and my delivery just happened so fast she didn\u2019t get there in time but she would\u2019ve been in the room with us if she\u2019d made it.", "When I was in labor and my inlaws were waitingbon me to get settled... a dude came out to tell his parents his wife was having a hard time and they were going to deliver with the help of forceps.  I would have been furious", "Not just his mom, sounds like there was an entire family group chat. And no, you\u2019re not the only one who finds that weird.", "When my cousin gave birth it was a huge messenger thread with constant updates from the one in labor, her husband, and then various relatives begging for little details and narrating what the baby was thinking.   I was so exhausted with it all from the beginning but felt like I couldn't leave the group without seeming rude.   The amount of left group notifications that happened after they said the baby was born and people said congrats, so many at once so I wasnt the only one overwhelmed by it. \n\nSome people want everyone involved but to me this one of those things where you should be in the moment and worry about others later.", "That says it all about this husband really. He is more a mummy's boy than a husband and father.", "Yeah I would have told my brother to get his ass off the phone and be present with his wife. I\u2019d venture to guess the SIL was probably wanting him to put the phone down too.", "Plus OP said new mom is quiet and reserved.  It's entirely possible she felt obligated to say yes in the first place.", "Agree. And I was so out of it on the pain meds (IV not epidural) with my first I couldn't even finish pushing (Dr pulled my son out after I stopped pushing halfway through), let alone consent to have my husband facetime the event live to relatives.", "I\u2019ve had it happen with real creeps and I\u2019ve had it happen when my boyfriend brought me a non-alcoholic drink when I was totally trashed at a bar. A woman looked out for me and told me not to take drinks from strangers because she thought I was out of it and a strange man was trying to drug me or pick me up.\n\nI showed her pictures of us together and it was definitely hilarious, but I admire the hell out of her.", "NTA", "Or for brother's vasectomy.", "It would be a hard \"no\" to FaceTime MIL's cranial rectal extraction. But it definitely needs doing.", "I would NOT have had the mental capacity to make a decision in that moment. I was in my own Friends episode long before it even came that far.\n\nAnd having my support holding a phone instead of being 100 % there for me? Hell no.", "Exactly! And better safe then sorry. Cause you can apologize if it is something she wanted but it\u2019s harder to apologize for an invasion of privacy (which, IMHO, it woukd be)", "I don\u2019t understand why your mom, or anyone who has given birth would want to cause such a distraction during such a stressful and personal time; anything that can go wrong just might and everyone should be in the present-not face timing. Good on you for having her six! I still don\u2019t understand what your dad is jumping on you about. \nNTA!", "And regardless of whether or not SIL was in on it, if you did not know that, your response was 100% reasonable. NTA", "To me, labor is not the time for facetime, because it's feel like spectacle. The husband job is to support the wife, the medical officer there to help with labor, and the people outside delivery room, need to stay outside and not interfere with what happened inside delivery room. This is not spectacle, whether they have discussion before or not.", "Sounds like a request from your MIL as this is cute idea and SIL saying yeah, I guess then MIL runs w it as 100% agreement.", "Thank you and definitely agree! He is sometimes very helpful when his family is pushing the limit, but he struggles a bit holding firm boundaries with MIL. But, we've discussed a lot since then and he will try to work on this. With upcoming holidays and RSV season, he'll have the chance to get some practice.", "Definitely NTA. I\u2019m guessing your SIL will thank you. What was your brother\u2019s reaction, or did he focus on the birth?", "You are nurse - I am sure you have seen similar craziness before. MY SIL gave my husband a full run down of dos and donts for our LD she learned from her LD stint. He didn\u2019t listen to half the don\u2019ts and it has scarred for life.", "Did you post in here not expecting differing opinions?\n\nIt's a group text. Not a hospital setting. You shouldn't have gotten involved.", "Exactly. She would\u2019ve just jumped on facetime as a response to the text of the dilation.", "I feel this! I made it very clear I only wanted my (ex now) husband with me and no visitors at all til the day after I delivered our son. And I almost kicked him out to go through it all alone. I'm a very private person when it comes to my body and didn't want anyone but my now ex husband seeing any of my lady bits or what was coming out of them \ud83d\ude02 Everyone respected it, though.", "Yeah I'm happy my first was during covid so we couldn't have everyone descend on us.   My parents were able to visit the next day for a short while but even that was exhausting.   One of my friends' mom has a great thing she says, she makes a point to always greet her daughter first because she's her child.   I felt kinda pushed aside when after this huge hard kinda traumatizing thing happened to me and my own parents are pushing each other over to hold the baby and barely acknowledging me.", "I feel that. I didn\u2019t count on visitors since we had no family in town. After a difficult pregnancy and a horrific delivery that ended in an emergency c-section, I looked and felt like roadkill. In came the parade of people I didn\u2019t even know. While I laid in a bed unable to even lift my head, sweat still pouring down my face, hair plastered to my head with sweat, in a nasty hospital gown. It was an extra level of invasiveness that still makes me peevy almost twenty years later. \ud83d\ude11", "Labor waits for no one! Your delivery story is like a whirlwind. It's amusing how you're in the middle of one of life's most intense moments, yet you're calmly instructing your husband to keep everyone in the loop. Fast labor is a force of its own!", "I think I prefer the old-fashioned way. You wore loose clothing, then, one day you showed up with a baby. No intrusive questions about your changing body, no badgering about name choices, no whining about being in the delivery room.", "Agreed... Probably just to stop the pressure play.", "I thought the same.", "I can only imagine all the other times they run roughshod over her. I hope being a new mother awakens a fierceness in her that scares MIL back into her lane.", "HIS relatives!", "Ok that\u2019s amazing honestly ! Go her!!", "I'm going to go go against the grain and giving her YTA because of her wording. If she had simply asked if SIL was okay with this, it would be fine. But she came off extremely aggressive. Plus her response when she was told SIL did agree was just, \"Whatever.\" When it really should have been \"oh, sorry. I didn't realize you guys had already spoken about this.\"\nIt's totally possible that SIL felt pressured by her mother-in law. It is also totally possible that SIL agreed, feeling like it would be extra support, especially from a woman who has already been there. Unfortunately, it's a bit late to figure that out during labor. Unless she planned on interrogating her brother during her SiL's labor. Which would probably be even more disruptive than the FaceTime itself.", "Happy Holidays and Congratulations on you new baby!", "You left out a word! Which one of you was scarred for life?", "\u2026. You questioned why I got involved. I gave my reasoning. I fully understand that it was a group chat and not a hospital setting. But my ethics don\u2019t stop at the hospital exit. Every vulnerable person deserves a voice and if I\u2019m in proximity, it\u2019ll be mine\u2026 Especially since my brother seemed to be in on the plan.", "OP says in a different comment that her SIL is a people pleaser, and her mother- who doesn\u2019t respect boundaries- frequently walks all over her. \n\nOP has *seen her mother bulldoze right over her SIL*. Multiple times. So yes, it was her place to get involved to prevent yet another demonstration of ridiculous disrespect for her SIL.", "I need my mom to support my husband lmao! He's not going to have an easy time. \nMom and dad both know my past experiences with this very pushy family, and also my hospital trauma- so I absolutely trust them to help advocate for me/us. And husband's mom is very quiet and passive, I trust her to help with lobby backup too. \nOof. To be the only mother not included. *shrugs* sucks to suck.", "Thank you so much \u2764 Happy Holidays to you as well!", "My mom is the intrusive one in our family. She even snuck in the bathroom and ripped the shower curtains open when I was 16 cause she thought I got my nippies pierced (fyi...I didnt). My dad was FURIOUS with her.\n\nI wish I had good close and supportive relationships like that with anyone in my family that I could be comfortable with when I'm most vulnerable. The only one I could've trusted to make sure my wishes were respected would've been my Dad. He did that with a lot of things for me when he was alive. I envy people who have that, but I've also accepted that I don't if that makes sense.", "You\u2019ve literally missed in another comment where OP says she\u2019s seen her mother disregard her SILs wishes and bulldoze right through SILs boundaries countless times. So yeah, it was reasonable to expect that good ol\u2019 mom was at it again, and to speak up about it.", "I'm in the same boat. My only two real advocates growing up were my twin and my Daddy. Ever since my twin moved 3,000 miles across the country, I've had no one else to connect with.     \n    \nMy Daddy never cared that I was different, I was always special to him. To my siblings and their friends other than my twin, I'm awkward and cringe-y, and therefore fair to exclude.", "I'm sorry to hear that. My support/advocate then was my Dad. Now I have my brother and my grandma in law. My brother likes to stay neutral about most things but defends me when he feels he needs to. Of course my husband also does. He's very protective over me and my son and will not tolerate anyone talking to me in a way he doesn't like. He kicked my ex out one day when he was dropping my son off cause for a while my ex and I didn't get along and he would scream at me. My husband didn't believe it was as bad as it was til he came home from work early one day and saw it for himself. He told him he does not and will not talk to me that way, especially in front of our son and that he needed to leave. He left without a word.", "Now I see what kind of MIL says this kind of request to begin with, thanks."]}
