NTA.\n\nEven if SIL did agree to FaceTime, it\u2019s not a problem for you to defend her. People in labor are very vulnerable, so even if your efforts weren\u2019t needed, it\u2019s still a nice gesture. \n\nLike when some other woman tells you that there\u2019s a creep checking you out and you look over to see your boyfriend. She might\u2019ve been wrong but I love that she was looking out for me.", "NTA\n\nI am a man and can't imagine how violated I would feel in the SIL's position if someone started facetiming while I was giving birth. Like, literally can't even comprehend how bad that would be. \n\nGood on you for standing up for her.", "NTA, even if SIL had previously agreed to Facetime, nothing wrong with you standing up for her in a vulnerable moment, especially as from the convo it sounded like Facetiming at the birth was a spontaneous decision. Your response may have been a bit intense, but in the heat of the moment understandable", "NTA. Just no MIL reddit is full of stories where people feel pressured by MIL to agree to something but they don't want it or change their minds in the the moment. Even if she did agree beforehand she may not have agreed once the reality of labor set in.", "NTA. \"that she and my brother had already discussed doing this\" and where was SIL in that discussion? If your mom meant to facetime after, then she could have clarified that to you all in the group chat. There was zero need for your dad to get all prissy.", "NTA you said absolutely not unless SIL agreed. Props to you I wish you were my SIL!", "Absolutely NTA. Your SIL is lucky to have you.", "God no, NTA.\n\nBut I\u2019m nosey, can you update us with your SIL\u2019s side of things, please?", "NTA at all! I want my mom and my partner there and that\u2019s it. I couldn\u2019t imagine a camera being held exposing me to more people while giving birth. Everyone can see the baby I just pushed out when I\u2019m ready.", "FaceTime so the Dad can be distracted holding the phone where your Mom can see\ud83e\udd74. If they really wanted your mom to be a part of it they would have asked her there. They probably just agreed(if they did) to be polite. I don\u2019t want my MIL on FaceTime when I\u2019m pushing a baby out. NTA.", "NTA, you were just doing your part having your SIL\u2019a back. Even if she did agree to it, I\u2019m sure she would appreciate you speaking up for her when she clearly wasn\u2019t able to in the moment. At the end of the day, it\u2019s not your mother or your father or your brother pushing out the baby, so they do not have a say in the matter. Good on you.", "NTA. Emotions were high and I kind of love that your defense was so strong! I'd be delighted if I was your SIL. If it turns out she did agree to FaceTime, then she knows you have her back. And your parents should be able to understand how the request looked in the chat. I mean sheesh, it looked wild.", "NTA at all.", "NTA even outside the egregious boundary violations to your SIL, your brother needed to be focused on his wife and child in that moment, not holding a phone or talking to his mother. I\u2019m appalled that either of them would think that\u2019s ok.", "If I were your SIL I would be so thankful for your consideration!  I have to wonder why the dad was busy chatting instead of focused on the imminent birth of their child and supporting their partner.\n\nNTA and may be the hero of the story.", "NTA\n\nOP, I think you're the angel in this scenario to be honest. I just gave birth and I'm a lot more quiet and private like your SIL. I had to stand up to my in laws a lot because they were constantly trying to come to the delivery and then wanting to be at the hospital immediately after even though I was a mess and needed a minute to bond with baby and regroup. \nAll I'm saying is I'd love it if I had a SIL like you standing up for me when I'm vulnerable like that (especially if I'm not part of the conversation). Maybe SIL did agree to FaceTime but you're right to call this pushy behavior out and ensure she's being respected and given as much space as she wants.", "I feel that if it had been previously agreed with SIL that your brother would\u2019ve just texted your mom or just called her - why put it in the group chat? Of if he put it there with the intention of calling your mom after why did she need to respond in all caps like that if it had already been planned? She could\u2019ve texted him privately, or just face timed him herself.\n\nI know it\u2019s just speculation but the clues lead me to believe they may not have had SIL\u2019s permission.\n\nBut either way, NTA. Because even if it was previously agreed upon, you didn\u2019t know and you were sticking up for your SIL. If I were your brother and it had been prearranged I would\u2019ve just responded \u201cthank you for looking out for Wife, however, the three of us agreed on this face time ahead of time\u201d instead of snapping at you. Their reactions are what make me suspicious of them tbh.\n\n& it is so inappropriate to ask that all, I feel. Like wtf. But that\u2019s just my personal opinion.", "NTA it's bizarre that she would even ask that. It's a vulnerable private moment no one should even this. If your SIL agreed I still say NTA because you were looking out and didn't know. You weren't rude either so nothing to apologize for. But truthfully asking to video while someone is pushing is bizarre.", "Nta good for you defending her", "NTA.\n\nYou win the SIL of the week award.  I seriously doubt SIL would have agreed with this, and you had her back.  I have a disturbing feeling your brother and Mom may have had this planned and always intended to give her a front-row seat whether your SIL liked it or not.  To do this when she's at her most vulnerable and unable to advocate for herself is disgusting.", "NTA.\n\nWow. Just wow.", "NTA.", "Nta", "NTA there are so many women who don\u2019t want their husbands with them\u2026 MIL is beyond entitled", "NTA. even if SIL agreed *before* that does not mean she agrees *in the moment.*\n\nIt's always best to verify *again* especially during something as volatile as childbirth in a supportive way. that means if she did say turn it off as she was pushing & her husband & MIL got angry because she agreed beforehand, that's an immediate fuck them in my book. \n\nAnd some hospitals don't even *let* you video/FT during pushing for a reason lol.", "NTA", "This is an unbelievable request. Your brother's focus should have been on his partner and the birth of his child, not pandering to his mother's wants. And as a woman who (I am assuming) has given birth she should certainly know better.   \n\nIf my husband had pulled this stunt I would have kicked him out of more than the labour ward. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHonestly, your brother is a huge AH. He should have been supporting his wife. He should not have been posting updates on his wife\u2019s cervix for all of his relatives.", "NTA. I would honestly have been mad if my husband was texting his mom regular updates on the size of my cervix. Wtf", "Who has time for that? He was about to miss his child birth to text with you people while his wife was in horrible pain and pressing his child out. \n\nHe is an idiot and I am glad  that you defended SIL", "NTA! I had the exact same reaction to reading this. Honestly, sounds like maybe your SIL was \u201cconvinced\u201d to do this during her delivery which is what I\u2019ve read a lot these days since I\u2019m giving birth soon myself. Due to her being quiet and shy, I doubt she honestly wanted to do it and just relented. Good on you for having her back. Childbirth is not a spectator sport! Leave the mommas alone! lol", "NTA.\n\n> she and my brother had already discussed doing this\n\nThat's nice, that was *before*. Consent *can* be revoked. \n\n>and that it wouldn\u2019t be during the actual delivery of the baby but afterwards.\n\nThen why was she demanding FaceTime *during*? Why not just openly clarify this instead of turning it into shady family drama? \n\n>If it didn\u2019t come as an unprompted offer directly from SIL, it\u2019s incredibly inappropriate for anyone else to ask\n\nThis is important. If SIL didn't *offer* this *freely*, then it was a horribly gauche request. It is not uncommon for women to feel pressured into agreeing to things to stay in their MILs favor, there is no harm in double checking the situation.\n\nEdit for typo", "Hell no, NTA. These are the times I wish Facetime didn\u2019t exist because some people cannot handle having 24/7 visual access to things. My mom also asked for facetime when i was in labor and we told her the hospital had a strict no video policy (which they did). Good on you for standing up for her.", "NTA FaceTime during a delivery is just not right and the fact that your brother didn't do it proves your point.", "NTA. If she agreed, still wanted to to do it, and circumstances allowed it then they would initiate the FT. Your mom is overstepping, and she knows it. That\u2019s why she got upset enough for your dad to hop in!", "Easiest NTA ever!!!", "Your mom sounds entitled and overbearing. NTA", "NTA. Glad somebody in your family was born with brains", "NTA\nYour SIL will thank you. Thank you for standing up for her!", "NTA", "nta. you're wonderful for standing up for your SIL", "NTA. Your SIL will be grateful for your intervention. If she wants to post videos, that\u2019s her choice, but you had her covered during a vulnerable moment. Women sometimes shit themselves when pushing. FaceTime when the baby is handed to the mother if she\u2019s willing. Not a second sooner.", "Nta. \nIt is very inapropriate and if she wanted her MIL there to watch she probably would have her there.", "NTA and if even if she had agreed before hand, she has the right to change her mind in the moment and your brother should have double checked that it's ok.\nAn agreement to facetime while pushing a watermelon out of your lady bits is not binding.", "NTA! Your SIL is so lucky to have you. MILs tend to not respect boundaries at all", "NTA you\u2019re a good SIL", "You\u2019re so NTA. Was your sister in law even on board with the pre \u201cFACETIME!\u201d discussion? Maybe I\u2019m uptight, but I would not be okay with my in-laws chatting about the state of my cervix.", "NTA and regardless of what SIL actually did or or didn\u2019t agree to or whatever arrangement your brother and mother had, you did the right thing. You stepped in to advocate for someone who probably was not able to advocate for herself in the moment. \n\nThe idea that anyone would expect a FaceTime during labor is honestly bonkers.", "NTA. As a very private person myself who recently gave birth, you are awesome for jumping on the defense like that, and I would be so grateful to have you as a SIL if I was in that position. Tbh I don\u2019t really care if you seemed mean or not but that\u2019s just me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f If your mom was supposed to FaceTime after the delivery then why did she type in all caps \u201cFACETIME\u201d right as she found out your SIL was pushing?? Obviously seems like she wanted to watch the birth. If that was me and I found out another family member other than my husband and hospital staff was watching me give birth I would be completely traumatized.", "NTA, OP. \n\nYou stood up for someone who didn\u2019t have the ability to stand up for herself, and I\u2019m glad that you did. \n\nI hate FaceTime in the best of times: giving birth would not be considered a \u201cbest time\u201d. \n\nAnd even if your mom did mean afterward, it\u2019s pushy and demanding to remind your brother at that very moment. If it was something they had agreed upon, he\u2019d FaceTime her afterward. I don\u2019t see that you did anything wrong at all here.", "NTA and honestly I find it really strange that your mom would make that request in the first place.", "Your mom is a narcissist.   Plan accordingly.  NTA.", "NTA. You were standing up for your SIL when she was in a vulnerable position, and if your mom and SIL had already prearranged the FaceTime, that doesn't negate the fact that you were protecting your SIL.", "NTA-  dad should be focusing on the woman giving birth,  not updating mommy dearest. \n\nI have a feeling that SIL is gonna be really happy you stopped this.", "NTA. As someone who has been married 14 years, I would give anything for a SIL like you. My SIL has always just ganged up on me along with MIL. You, however, you stood up for and protected your SIL as if she were a blood sibling. That is something to treasure. Mom and Dad can and should get over it. I don't understand what was so wrong with what you said anyway. It's not like you personally insulted or disrespected your mother. You simply said something she was doing seemed inappropriate. Are we not able to communicate honestly with our family? Mom needs to check her ego, take a breath and look at what was actually said. Nothing horrible, even if SIL had OKd this.", "Your brother is the AH.  He is there to support his wife, not to provide the evening entertainment for his mother.", "NTA I am just baffled, baffled by how many women who feel the need to lock a door in a stall in a public bathroom because god forbid someone get a glimpse of their skin below the waist suddenly think it is just fine and dandy to want to watch their daughter in law push a baby out of their genitals. None of those same women would invite their daughter in law to their own OB-GYN appointment, not would they accompany DIL to hers. But a baby? Ooh let me watch! MIL is an AH", "Did your SIL agree to it or not?  If no, N T A.  If yes, Y T A. \n\nIt's all about SIL giving consent a head of time.", "YTA I understand defending your SIL but also this isn\u2019t your battle to fight.

It sounds like it was just a general reminder to FaceTime once the baby was there.  If you wanted to get in the middle of it you should have at least clarified what she was asking for before jumping to your SIL' s defense.", "Not sure why you got involved at all", "Honestly you wasted your time most hospitals banned videos and photos during labor. If your mom and brother had already discussed it. \n\nMy recommendation is if you don\u2019t know what was discussed before don\u2019t jump into conclusions. Your mom has a right to be excited.

If mum couldn't be physically present to support her, space and privacy is the next best thing.", "you did good!!", "Just want to say thank you for being such an amazing SIL and actually considering these things. Nonetheless taking action for her! I wish you were my SIL! As a meek and quiet woman myself, the thought of a SIL who actually cares almost makes me cry. It\u2019s really important to feel valued, comfortable and understood when joining a family. Truly, THANK YOU. (Ps, NTA)", "When all is said and done, I bet your SIL will be grateful she wasn\u2019t being FaceTimed during her delivery. Totally inappropriate of your mom. NTA.", "I have a similarly boundary stomping mother. I\u2019ve had to stick up for my sister in law a number of times in the face of my mother\u2019s completely irrational and wildly overstepping behaviour. I\u2019m already the black sheep and have next to no relationship with my mother as it is, so I\u2019m happy to be the bad guy if it gives my SIL and my brother a bit of peace and quiet and keeps their boundaries in place without them getting the brunt of her anger. They have to maintain a relationship with her, so they have to toe the line a bit more. It\u2019s frustrating, but I get it", "I wouldn't have offered it to my own mother either, but my MIL would have been welcome.  It's a personal choice.  But I don't think you were in the wrong to defend her.", "Congrats on your nephew.  Most important thing is that mom and baby made it through. Clearly you are an excellent SIL and Auntie. NTA", "Just give the doctor a heads up so he can duck. Otherwise agreed.", "This was really none of your business. And it was happening after the baby was born. You had no idea what the agreement was, what the plan was etc. You inserted yourself to be right, not with any context or anything else. \n\nAnd if your mom asked months ago or even a couple of weeks ago again, it is none of your business. Your mom can ask, they can say no. It's not inappropriate to ask a question. It is inappropriate to act as if you know the situation, know the plan and then call people out on it based on your opinion.", "I think the fact you know your mum has issues respecting boundaries adds some additional context. Sounds like your response to the group chat was based on past experience. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if SIL thanks you for having her back if you ever chat directly about this. NTA", "[deleted]", "oh my God! yes!!!", "Initially the demand to FaceTime was *during* the delivery. It wasn\u2019t until I said something that they started crawfishing and saying, \u201cOh, it was for *after* the baby was born.\u201d So I feel like they were lying to save face after being called out. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "Her telling her mom she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for her to ask doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s making a decision. She made a statement to her mom, she didn\u2019t make a decision for SIL.", "It is still NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. Seriously. It wasn't your delivery. It wasn't a demand, it was excitement. You are acting as if this was your delivery, your baby etc.", "It isn't the mom's delivery either. Unless it was ironclad that SIL agreed to it then no one has the right to demand to be present in a birthing space. And if SIL did agree and she just didn't know, then I don't see whats wrong with checking in about it. As a woman who has been in labor I would be grateful my SIL thought to ask that when I was in my most vulnerable state.", "OP didn't ask. She berated her parents out of some sense of being right without knowing the context or anything else. And then accused them (in a comment to me) of \"crawfishing\" because she must be right. She wasn't defending SIL, SIL had no idea what was going on. OP even says that even if her mom asked previously and it was agreed on it wouldn't matter because in OP's mind it was wrong to ask. OP's need to be right is the issue here. \n\nThere was no demand. There was excited word text messaged."]}
