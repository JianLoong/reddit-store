The reason I'm going with ESH is because she could easily have fixed the whole problem that seems to have impacted the whole group for the trip with one sentence.", "Both great ways to figures some shit out real quick!", "The correct question is why didn\u2019t HE say something? You\u2019re just equivocating.", "Comment straight out of r/RomanticAdvice", "My problem with this is that even though it sounds good, this 'keeping the peace' always tends to end up with one person shouldering the load of guiding the other person to stop being an AH, taking on the effort of 'OK well let me put my frustration on the backburner to nicely take you aside and process your feelings about this' instead of the person who is being an AH learning to stop doing it without putting that burden on someone else.\n\nYou agree that he's being a jerk with a major ego problem, but she's gotta fix it? Going down this path ends up with the reasonable person always having to be the one to sort it out and take responsibility for guiding the relationship to a healthier place after the AH has been an AH and that's not good. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Some people are too engrossed with themselves sometimes that they fail to realize what's happening unless someone brings it to their attention.\r  \n\r\n\nThis is exactly the problem. They need to stop failing to realise, and not rely on someone else to bring it to their attention, and that's exactly my issue with saying she should have worked harder to make him see he was being an AH. It's on him to recognise it and stop, or deal with the consequences. Because otherwise it ends up with her eternally having to take responsibility for 'bringing it to his attention' that he's being a d!ck, and that's exhausting. \n\nHe shouldn't need a 'heart to heart' to recognise that telling her to set up the tent by herself and cold shouldering her over this was a d!ck move. She shouldn't have to baby him through getting to that realisation, so if she didn't want to, that's fine. Because while relationships take effort from all parties, that also means *him* putting in the effort, or copping the consequence of her being pissed at him when he's been an AH, especially when he was deliberately being passive aggressive.", "You're making her take the burden of ensuring his fragile masculinity is protected. He also didn't have a convo with her about his feelings he ignored her and made her do all the work on a 5 day joint trip. He's TA.", "No.\n\nBecause if she had been carrying the heavier pack, as long as she was comfortable handling it *that would have been okay*.\n\nThe teasing is shitty, sure - but the big problem here is his behavior.\n\nShe\u2019s not responsible for that, and she\u2019s not responsible for playing peacemaker between him and his friends so he treats her decently.", "Sounds like his problem, not hers.", "I wholeheartedly agree with you. There is only so much that you can do. There is always the danger of everything falling on your shoulders.\n\nWhen you are trying hard to rescue someone who has fallen down a well, and they are fighting you as you're pulling them up, you will have no choice but to let go.\n\nI am not saying she should shoulder the burden, but at least have the conversation. Let her feelings, his attitude, and what he is doing known. He may, or he may not be aware of them. It's on him. If nothing comes of it, leave it. It maybe time to let him fall down that well.", ">You're making her take the burden of ensuring his fragile masculinity is protected.\n\nI said no such thing. What I said is applicable to him as well. All relationships require effort for all parties involved. My reply is for HER only. I am not replying to HIM otherwise I would have said a lot to HIM including what a p!ece of sh!t I think he is.\n\nThe question is whether the relationship is worth working out for HER. If it is, asking her if she had a conversation with HIM is a valid question. And though it required a little effort on her part.\n\nIt seems a lot of people do not believe that the OP's relationship is worth ANY effort at all. And I get it, especially the cr@ppy way he treated. But my original reply was directed at the OP to find out what SHE thinks.", "That we can agree on! \n\nThanks for a constructive discussion :)", "And thank you as well.  :)"]}
