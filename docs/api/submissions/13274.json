Food takes up less room but is heavier so his weighted a bit more but it\u2019s ok because he is bigger. But then he asked me to carry the food backpack and let him carry my bigger backpack because he didn\u2019t want his friends to make fun of him for carrying the smaller backpack. I said no because his backpack is unisex while mine if made for women and has the hip belt and build that is meant for me and is more comfortable.

He's being incredibly petty and insecure. They're just backpacks, if he really wanted to play \"mine's bigger than yours\" with his gf, then he should have brought a bigger backpack to make himself look more manly. You didn't humiliate him, he humiliated himself", "NTA. You didn't humiliate your bf, you just carried your own backpack. Your bf, on the other hand, treated you like trash for what sounds like a full week, plus he created more work and difficulty for you and lessened what would have been a great trip. \n\nDoes he often punish you for doing what's in your own best interests?", "NTA for not switching bags - yours is yours and it's important to have a well-fitting pack, especially on such a long trip. But why in the world didn't one of you just say \"yeah, it's smaller but it's way heavier\" and end it? Sheesh. His friends sound tiring (and so does he, tbh).", "NTA because your bf here is the one acting like a child. Take note of this red flag Op, as more are sure to follow.", "Info; did he not at any point over the course of five days not say the sentence \u201ci\u2019m carrying the heavier bag\u201d? Also; why is he friends with people he cant calmly be like \u201chey this isnt funny anymore lets drop it\u201d and they respect it?", "NTA.\n\nAnd now you have someone locked in your basement, so there\u2019s that off your bucket list!", "NTA.   The simple fix for this was to show his friends that his pack was heavier than yours.  It would have taken less than a minute to demonstrate that.  Now he's hiding in the basement and giving you the silent treatment.  He sounds like a little, dumb, over sensitive man, to be honest.  Good luck.", "NTA \ud83e\udd23 how old are you guys? I wouldn't call it constructive to yell at him but kudos for not doing it while packing for the trip. And then he LOCKED HIMSELF IN THE BASEMENT \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 If this basement is part of shared living space, I'd use his pouting time to pack the shit of whoever's leaving", "So he wants to seem masculine, but proceeds to lock himself in a basement? Can we say ironic? \nNTA", "Ima go with nta , he got the wrong kind of friends if he gotta worry about what kind of book bag he is wearing. He might have just wanted the lighter bag tho lol.", "NTA, your bf sounds very immature.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is a pathetic little man. Being \"humiliated\" because you carried the bigger bag is just.. God. Sometimes I forget how insecure other men are.", "Lord. Leave him in the basement permanently.\n\nWhat's humiliating is having such a sensitive sense of masculinity that you care who carries the bigger bag, having friends who think this is something to make fun of, and being unable to even use words enough to say 'I really don't know why you guys care so much, GF and I are both pulling our weight and we're fine'.\n\nTo put passive aggressive sulking on top of it is sooooo.... ugh. Who has patience for such men? I would have been wishing he got lost in the forest, tbh.\n\nNTA", "Nta, he has ah friends", "Goodness dump this dude. He\u2019s wayyy tooo immature lol.

You deserve a grown up lol. \n\nNTA", "NTA - dump his self-centred insecure fragile snowflake ass.", "NTA, looks like toxic masculinity got invited for camping too.\n\nThis is beyond idiotic on his part. He punished you for the entire trip for his own weird hang up and then locked himself in the basement? Is he 12?!\n\nI am exasperated.", "NTA he sounds silly I hope you move on quickly", "NTA. Your bf and his friends have very childish views on masculinity. It's not your job to enable them.", "NTA, it\u2019s his own fault for owning that backpack. It\u2019s unreasonable for him to expect you to switch backpacks because of his choice.", "NTA - tell me your emotionally immature without telling me\u2026. As a climber I sometimes have a bigger bag than my hubby but he has all the gear and mine is light AF never thought twice about it.", "NTA!  If your boyfriend's masculinity is so important to him he could have purchased a larger backpack.", "NTA. Instead of addressing his friends being shitty he took it out on you. Toxic masculinity wins again \ud83d\ude43", "NTA of course, he really shouldn't have cared what they thought if he is a secure person. He should have just laughed it off. But why didn't you guys have his friends hold both backpacks so they could see for themselves which is heavier? That might have prevented the teasing.", "NTA but perhaps a little harsh. Nonetheless he is too weak for you and you should move on.", "NTA. Dump him", "Oof your bf sounds toxic af. Please tell me you don't intentionally let him win this so he doesn't throw a fit.

Girl, he is not the one", "Oh my gosh, obviously NTA. \nBut the real question is, why are you with this person? \nI can\u2019t imagine that he\u2019s usually a complete gem and this is the first time he\u2019s ever behaved like this. \nAnd there\u2019s no good quality I can think of that would make this shit worth it.", "I don't get how he can that upset over it for five days. NTA.", "NTA \n\nBut this has such an easy solution. \n\nWhen his friends started giving him shit why didn\u2019t one of you, or both of you, speak up and say \u201cyeah the backpack looks smaller, but it\u2019s carrying all the food so it\u2019s total poundage is more.\u201d", "NTA\n\nHowever, I have to ask:\n\n* Did you say anything to his friends about his backpack weighing more when his friends started picking on him?\n* Did you side with him and defend him?\n* Did you pull him aside during the trip and have a heart to heart talk with him about his attitude and how you feel?\n* Did you just let it all stew to a breaking point all during the trip without doing anything to avert it, and then waited until getting home to snap?\n\nI feel that while you are NOT THE AH and he definitely has an ego problem, you're not entirely off the hook.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not on her to do all the work of resolving it with a heart to heart when he could resolve it by simply not acting so childish.\n\nI think he definitely has a major ego problem that he needs to work on. But they are in a relationship. I'm assuming she wants to stay in the relationship. Relationships takes effort for all the parties involved wanting for the relationship to work. It would be to her benefit to shut down the problem before it gets too big. And no, I don't mean she has to do all the work. By having a conversation with him and telling him her feelings and his attitude, she puts the responsibility on him to do something out it. Some people are too engrossed with themselves sometimes that they fail to realize what's happening unless someone brings it to their attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'll give you a little on this one, but he didn't do any better. Besides, its hard to hash out an argument when you're on a camping trip with other people.\n\nNo, he didn't. In fact in this story, I say he is THE AH. As for place to talk to him in private, I am assuming they shared the tent. Going for a walk so distance in the woods works too.", "No where in my answer above says she is responsible for his hurt feelings. However, they are in a relationship. I am assuming being in this relationship matters to her in which case I would think she would at very least communicate her feeling with him and talk about the problem with him during the trip and not letting it build up.\n\nIn case you missed it the first time, NTA. There is repeated it again just for you."]}
