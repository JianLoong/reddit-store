It's your life, at 50 you don't need to \"clear it\" with your family.", "NTA, your mother is over reacting. If you are thinking of having an event over a holiday you tell people early as plans are made moths or even over a year ahead. Not your job to ensure no one has things in mind before you plan a vacation.", "NTA Its insane that they're asking you to rebook a vacation on a wedding date that's tentative. \n\nJust have fun.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister is an attention hog (did she really have to announce the engagement during her nephew\u2019s graduation, taking the attention off of him?). The only people you should be clearing your schedule with are the people in your immediate household  (and work if you\u2019re working of course). Your world doesn\u2019t revolve around your sister nor should it.", "NTA. Wow, I think we have the same sister.", "NTA - People get engaged all the time, and are sometimes engaged for years.

Sis hasn't even actually scheduled the date??? \n\nThat said, your Mom isn't wrong that the normal thing to do when you know someone is planning a wedding is to check in to see if they've set a date yet before you book a vacation or something else. However, I can also understand not bothering to check in with your sister given her tendency to be cagey with info and weird about shit like this in general. \n\nWere you worried that if you asked about that date she would just tell you that's the date she set for the wedding whether it was true or not, regardless of what date you asked about? Some people are fuckin weird like that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I didn\u2019t even think to ask her. This may sound rude- but I\u2019m tired of banging my head against a brick wall. \n\nFor example- about three months before she announced her daughters date (even though she knew it) I asked her when the wedding was going to be. Her response was \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\nI said \u201cthere\u2019s more than one???\u201d And she just laughed. She announced she was engaged like five months later. \n\nSo yea. That\u2019s the kind of person she is. \n\nShe plays games. I don\u2019t ever get a straight answer out of her. She\u2019s engaged but I don\u2019t know that she will ever actually GET married. She is 57 years old- she has lied about being married before, lied about being engaged. She makes up stories all the time. \n\nShe could absolutely tell us all tomorrow that she is getting married on Christmas Day and expect us to drop everything. \n\nIt never even crossed my mind to ask her because we barely even talk. And that\u2019s something that goes two ways. The only communication between us in years has been initiated by me - and like I said- one word answers.", "Normal for who. it's the brides responsibility to announce the date of they want it on a prominent holiday and even then they suck for the date choice", "Haha yeah fuck her."]}
