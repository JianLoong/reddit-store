{"id": 5626, "submission_id": "zv4icp", "title": "AITA for bringing up my sister\u2019s body count during Christmas?", "selftext": "Now, I know the title sounds awful, but please let me explain myself. I, F19, have two sisters, F21 and F17. My eldest sister moved out of the house around two years ago, while my sister and I still live at home. I was at first sad when she left, but over time I realized how happy I was with the extra space in the house. Most importantly, my sisters couldn\u2019t team up against me with her gone. For as long as I can remember, my two sisters have always been each other\u2019s favorites. They have common interests such as music tastes, style, etc., whereas I am completely different from the two of them. Not only do they come for my depression/ anxiety\u2014 I take medication for the two which is apparently funny to them\u2014 but they make fun of my biggest insecurity, too: my hair.\n\nMy oldest sister has 3B-3C hair, my little sister has 3B hair, and I have between 4B-4C hair. I\u2019ve always struggled with confidence because of it, and they both know this. And anytime the two are together, they go out of their way to make me feel bad about it. They call me mean names and compare me to different animals, tell me that my hair is \u201cbad hair\u201d and so on. So, this morning when we were opening Christmas gifts, I mentioned that I was going to be taking my braids (knotless) out. My eldest sister looks at me and says, \u201cYeah they should have been taken out a long time ago. They look nasty.\u201d\n\nI gave her a look and my mom looked at me waiting on a response. She could tell it hurt my feelings but didn\u2019t say anything. So, a few hours pass and I\u2019m still a bit hurt about her comment. We\u2019re all sitting in the living room, when my sister sees a video on TikTok with a woman talking about her body count. It was probably around 15 or so. Nothing bad at all, but my sister began to judge this woman who she didn\u2019t even know. I looked at her, and against my better judgement said, \u201cYou\u2019re acting like your body count isn\u2019t right up there with hers.\u201d\n\nEveryone looked at me like I committed a crime. My sister\u2019s body count is anywhere from 10-20. So, for her to judge someone else over their choices was extremely hypocritical. She regrets a lot of the people he has slept with, so after her comment about my hair I just wanted to hurt her feelings as bad as she did mine.\n\nMy mom told me that it was rude and that I need to apologize, but she didn\u2019t say anything to my sister when she made fun of my hair.\n\nMaybe I was out of line, but a part of me feels like she needed to be taken down a notch. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: So, apparently I wasn\u2019t clear enough. I wasn\u2019t judging my sister on her body count, I called her a HYPOCRITE for judging someone else\u2019s body count even though they\u2019re both the same. SHE SLUT-SHAMED another woman for her body-count, and said that she was gross for it, when her body count is almost the same as the woman\u2019s. I called her out for being a HYPOCRITE, I\u2019m not slut-shaming my sister.", "created_utc": 1671995777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv4icp/aita_for_bringing_up_my_sisters_body_count_during/", "score": 2397, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do tell the person that being a bully is a sign of insecurity and that they should seek psychiatric care to address the issue.\n\nFind a moment with your mom and remind her that she has a duty to protect you from bullies like your sisters. If she does not intervene on your behalf, she should not say anything to you when you say something that hurts another sister's feelings. Tell her it is an all-or-none issue. She may not like hearing it, but if you remain calm and unemotional, she will \"hear\" you later and realize you are correct.\n\nThe first time you stand up for yourself will be a little frightening but know that afterward, you will have a confidence boost to make up for it. If, after you stand up for yourself, drama ensues, leave the room laughing. [Imagine all of them bald with dog poop smeared on their heads if it will make you laugh.]\n\nThe only way to stop abuse is to face it and tell the person to stop. Using the word \"bully\" in your reply to someone should hurt them. Use the word. Even say, \"Being a bully is abuse. I will not allow anyone to abuse me.\" That is a double whammy because it is true. If you do not stand up for yourself, nobody else ever will. Trust me when I say, \"telling someone they are a bully and an abuser feels good every time.\" It will become your new superpower.\n\nAgain, remaining calm and not letting see any emotion drives your message harder than anger or hurt. It has the added benefit of making the person bullying you wonder if you might be a little kra-kra. Having a flat affect when others expect some form of demonstrable emotion is unsettling. That is one reason when someone gets loud (yells) at me, I do not show any emotion, and I speak quietly. To hear what I am telling them, they have to stop yelling. Yes, it is controlling behavior, but being assertive means controlling what happens around you. Again, it feels fantastic the first few times. After that, people will begin respecting you as an individual; if not, you leave them wondering what you may do next.

As long as someone having sex is taking proper safety measures and it\u2019s consensual, no one is being harmed by having sex. \n\nThe only comparable part of both of these is what people do with or to their bodies is none of your business and you have no right shaming them.", "So, they said something with the intention of hurting the other person.

It just makes you just as immature as the other person. \nI\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve never lashed out at someone in response to their behavior, but their behavior never excused mine and I made an active choice to stoop to their level.
