{"id": 5626, "submission_id": "zv4icp", "title": "AITA for bringing up my sister\u2019s body count during Christmas?", "selftext": "Now, I know the title sounds awful, but please let me explain myself. I, F19, have two sisters, F21 and F17. My eldest sister moved out of the house around two years ago, while my sister and I still live at home. I was at first sad when she left, but over time I realized how happy I was with the extra space in the house. Most importantly, my sisters couldn\u2019t team up against me with her gone. For as long as I can remember, my two sisters have always been each other\u2019s favorites. They have common interests such as music tastes, style, etc., whereas I am completely different from the two of them. Not only do they come for my depression/ anxiety\u2014 I take medication for the two which is apparently funny to them\u2014 but they make fun of my biggest insecurity, too: my hair.\n\nMy oldest sister has 3B-3C hair, my little sister has 3B hair, and I have between 4B-4C hair. I\u2019ve always struggled with confidence because of it, and they both know this. And anytime the two are together, they go out of their way to make me feel bad about it. They call me mean names and compare me to different animals, tell me that my hair is \u201cbad hair\u201d and so on. So, this morning when we were opening Christmas gifts, I mentioned that I was going to be taking my braids (knotless) out. My eldest sister looks at me and says, \u201cYeah they should have been taken out a long time ago. They look nasty.\u201d\n\nI gave her a look and my mom looked at me waiting on a response. She could tell it hurt my feelings but didn\u2019t say anything. So, a few hours pass and I\u2019m still a bit hurt about her comment. We\u2019re all sitting in the living room, when my sister sees a video on TikTok with a woman talking about her body count. It was probably around 15 or so. Nothing bad at all, but my sister began to judge this woman who she didn\u2019t even know. I looked at her, and against my better judgement said, \u201cYou\u2019re acting like your body count isn\u2019t right up there with hers.\u201d\n\nEveryone looked at me like I committed a crime. My sister\u2019s body count is anywhere from 10-20. So, for her to judge someone else over their choices was extremely hypocritical. She regrets a lot of the people he has slept with, so after her comment about my hair I just wanted to hurt her feelings as bad as she did mine.\n\nMy mom told me that it was rude and that I need to apologize, but she didn\u2019t say anything to my sister when she made fun of my hair.\n\nMaybe I was out of line, but a part of me feels like she needed to be taken down a notch. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: So, apparently I wasn\u2019t clear enough. I wasn\u2019t judging my sister on her body count, I called her a HYPOCRITE for judging someone else\u2019s body count even though they\u2019re both the same. SHE SLUT-SHAMED another woman for her body-count, and said that she was gross for it, when her body count is almost the same as the woman\u2019s. I called her out for being a HYPOCRITE, I\u2019m not slut-shaming my sister.", "created_utc": 1671995777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv4icp/aita_for_bringing_up_my_sisters_body_count_during/", "score": 260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes your sis was being an AH, but you went above and beyond to shut shame her in front of your whole family. How could you not be an AH here? Her being an AH doesn't mean you should be too.

OMG, I called her hypocrite for judging another woman when they have the same body count.

Like gosh whether sibling pick on each other like \u201coh siblings always do this\u201d, this just seems like they\u2019re being cruel. I\u2019m so sorry you had to lose confidence over that. I\u2019m not familiar with hair types so I had to do the ole google and excuse them but your hair type so gorgeous! And to go on, I say NTA because whether you should fire back or not 1) I gotta agree she needed to be knocked down a peg (I realize not everyone becomes like this but I\u2019ve seen some results of people who think their behavior is ok and continue to do it, and usually it\u2019s hypocritical people) 2) how can she judge someone like that when she has done the same? I hope none of this sounds rude just trying not to ramble.\n\nBut your sister has regrets, correct? What if this other girl feels the same. We don\u2019t know her story. I\u2019m just kind of curious if maybe your sister is insecure and projecting her own self insecurities into this person.", "NTA but saying a body count that high isn\u2019t wrong is kinda wack", "NTA Dont dish it out if you can not take it", "Yeah, the title made me think this was going to be a clear Y T A situation, but OP was just calling out her sister on her hypocrisy, she clearly wasn't trying to slutshame her sister. \n\nOne thing that stood out to me though was that OP's mother was quiet and refused to interfere when OP's sister insulted her, yet jumped in to defend the sister when OP called her a hypocrite. Clearly favoritism is at play here. OP is literally the only person in this situation who isn't a massive asshole.\n\nNTA", "She\u2019s not a sister.\n\nShe\u2019s fucking bullying OP 24/7 and you\u2019re telling OP to just \u201cget there\u201d and cope?", "So tell me how often you rollover for people insulting you in your family? You seem to be an expert at preaching how to be a doormat.", "And also the term **body count**, which is very funny", "Lmao dude people can have a personal opinion about whatever they want, but just like it\u2019s not okay to be racist, homophobic etc. , it\u2019s not okay to slut shame.
