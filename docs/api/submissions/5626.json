{"id": 5626, "submission_id": "zv4icp", "title": "AITA for bringing up my sister\u2019s body count during Christmas?", "selftext": "Now, I know the title sounds awful, but please let me explain myself. I, F19, have two sisters, F21 and F17. My eldest sister moved out of the house around two years ago, while my sister and I still live at home. I was at first sad when she left, but over time I realized how happy I was with the extra space in the house. Most importantly, my sisters couldn\u2019t team up against me with her gone. For as long as I can remember, my two sisters have always been each other\u2019s favorites. They have common interests such as music tastes, style, etc., whereas I am completely different from the two of them. Not only do they come for my depression/ anxiety\u2014 I take medication for the two which is apparently funny to them\u2014 but they make fun of my biggest insecurity, too: my hair.\n\nMy oldest sister has 3B-3C hair, my little sister has 3B hair, and I have between 4B-4C hair. I\u2019ve always struggled with confidence because of it, and they both know this. And anytime the two are together, they go out of their way to make me feel bad about it. They call me mean names and compare me to different animals, tell me that my hair is \u201cbad hair\u201d and so on. So, this morning when we were opening Christmas gifts, I mentioned that I was going to be taking my braids (knotless) out. My eldest sister looks at me and says, \u201cYeah they should have been taken out a long time ago. They look nasty.\u201d\n\nI gave her a look and my mom looked at me waiting on a response. She could tell it hurt my feelings but didn\u2019t say anything. So, a few hours pass and I\u2019m still a bit hurt about her comment. We\u2019re all sitting in the living room, when my sister sees a video on TikTok with a woman talking about her body count. It was probably around 15 or so. Nothing bad at all, but my sister began to judge this woman who she didn\u2019t even know. I looked at her, and against my better judgement said, \u201cYou\u2019re acting like your body count isn\u2019t right up there with hers.\u201d\n\nEveryone looked at me like I committed a crime. My sister\u2019s body count is anywhere from 10-20. So, for her to judge someone else over their choices was extremely hypocritical. She regrets a lot of the people he has slept with, so after her comment about my hair I just wanted to hurt her feelings as bad as she did mine.\n\nMy mom told me that it was rude and that I need to apologize, but she didn\u2019t say anything to my sister when she made fun of my hair.\n\nMaybe I was out of line, but a part of me feels like she needed to be taken down a notch. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: So, apparently I wasn\u2019t clear enough. I wasn\u2019t judging my sister on her body count, I called her a HYPOCRITE for judging someone else\u2019s body count even though they\u2019re both the same. SHE SLUT-SHAMED another woman for her body-count, and said that she was gross for it, when her body count is almost the same as the woman\u2019s. I called her out for being a HYPOCRITE, I\u2019m not slut-shaming my sister.", "created_utc": 1671995777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv4icp/aita_for_bringing_up_my_sisters_body_count_during/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You just pointed the hypocrisy out.", "NTA\n\nShe was trying to slut shame somebody. You pointed out she's in the same category as the person she's slut shaming. Pointing out someone is being a hypocrite is fine in my book.", "NTA. If she intentionally makes comments towards you to bring you down and hurt you, and you call out her hypocrisy as long as it wasn\u2019t true slut shaming, she got what she had coming for her. Have never understood people being upset about coming back at someone who constantly harasses you and brings you down.", "NTA. She brought up the topic. You just told her it was rude (throwing stones from glass houses kind of thing). Though you are kind of splitting hairs with your edit - the implication is still that both your sister and this TikTok woman should be ashamed. \n\nYou should say something when they are mean about your hair.

I\u2019m also sorry your mom was an asshole and didn\u2019t stand up for you. I\u2019m curious to know if your mom has 4b/c hair too. I suspect the disdain for your hair comes from seeds she planted. \n\nBut yeah NTA.

It wasn't your place to announce to everyone how many people your sister has or has not slept with. It also isn't right for her to make fun of your hair. And your mother shouldn't have allowed your sister to make fun of you without standing up for you.", "ESH. Yes your sis was being an AH, but you went above and beyond to shut shame her in front of your whole family. How could you not be an AH here? Her being an AH doesn't mean you should be too. And that was hardly tit for tat, you went for the jugular. So not cool.", "YTA you clearly brought up her body count because you were hurting. \n\nIf you wanted to truly engage with the idea of body count, you could have discussed it a million ways without making it personal. \n\nIf you wanted to discuss how your sisters mock your appearance, then address that head on, like a grown up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OMG, I called her hypocrite for judging another woman when they have the same body count. The relevance is that BOTH of my sisters include themselves in texturism all of the time because they think they have \u201cbetter hair\u201d than me because I have 4C hair. THAT\u2019S the relevance. They LAUGH and JUDGE me because of the texture of my  hair.", "and ALSO- the whole \u201cfamily\u201d means my mother and other sister, whom of which ALL know her body count, too.", "I'm so sorry you've had that happen to you.
