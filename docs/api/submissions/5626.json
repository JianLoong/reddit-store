{"id": 5626, "submission_id": "zv4icp", "title": "AITA for bringing up my sister\u2019s body count during Christmas?", "selftext": "Now, I know the title sounds awful, but please let me explain myself. I, F19, have two sisters, F21 and F17. My eldest sister moved out of the house around two years ago, while my sister and I still live at home. I was at first sad when she left, but over time I realized how happy I was with the extra space in the house. Most importantly, my sisters couldn\u2019t team up against me with her gone. For as long as I can remember, my two sisters have always been each other\u2019s favorites. They have common interests such as music tastes, style, etc., whereas I am completely different from the two of them. Not only do they come for my depression/ anxiety\u2014 I take medication for the two which is apparently funny to them\u2014 but they make fun of my biggest insecurity, too: my hair.\n\nMy oldest sister has 3B-3C hair, my little sister has 3B hair, and I have between 4B-4C hair. I\u2019ve always struggled with confidence because of it, and they both know this. And anytime the two are together, they go out of their way to make me feel bad about it. They call me mean names and compare me to different animals, tell me that my hair is \u201cbad hair\u201d and so on. So, this morning when we were opening Christmas gifts, I mentioned that I was going to be taking my braids (knotless) out. My eldest sister looks at me and says, \u201cYeah they should have been taken out a long time ago. They look nasty.\u201d\n\nI gave her a look and my mom looked at me waiting on a response. She could tell it hurt my feelings but didn\u2019t say anything. So, a few hours pass and I\u2019m still a bit hurt about her comment. We\u2019re all sitting in the living room, when my sister sees a video on TikTok with a woman talking about her body count. It was probably around 15 or so. Nothing bad at all, but my sister began to judge this woman who she didn\u2019t even know. I looked at her, and against my better judgement said, \u201cYou\u2019re acting like your body count isn\u2019t right up there with hers.\u201d\n\nEveryone looked at me like I committed a crime. My sister\u2019s body count is anywhere from 10-20. So, for her to judge someone else over their choices was extremely hypocritical. She regrets a lot of the people he has slept with, so after her comment about my hair I just wanted to hurt her feelings as bad as she did mine.\n\nMy mom told me that it was rude and that I need to apologize, but she didn\u2019t say anything to my sister when she made fun of my hair.\n\nMaybe I was out of line, but a part of me feels like she needed to be taken down a notch. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: So, apparently I wasn\u2019t clear enough. I wasn\u2019t judging my sister on her body count, I called her a HYPOCRITE for judging someone else\u2019s body count even though they\u2019re both the same. SHE SLUT-SHAMED another woman for her body-count, and said that she was gross for it, when her body count is almost the same as the woman\u2019s. I called her out for being a HYPOCRITE, I\u2019m not slut-shaming my sister.", "created_utc": 1671995777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv4icp/aita_for_bringing_up_my_sisters_body_count_during/", "score": 742, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How they got tired of people calling them skinny. How they need to eat more. How they need more meat on their bones. And they finally blew up and said something about this person being overweight. \n\nIs this valid in your eyes? If not, tell me why not?", "There is a difference between being blunt and having sh*tty beliefs, especially when those beliefs are rooted in sexism. I'm autistic. I'm always blunt. But I'm not actively nasty to people even if I disagree with them.", "So let me get this straight...  calling out bigots for hateful views is the same thing as when minorities got killed simply for existing in the wrong place?", "Now your comparing old world views and new world views. I\u2019m just saying y\u2019all spew as much hate and act hypocritically. If you wanna tell the world youre gay, youre trans, youre left, youre right, youre fat, youre an addict, whatever. Have at it. But don\u2019t take offense when someone other than yourself, feels differently, and speaks their felt feelings. They\u2019re just as much allowed to have their thoughts as you are about them.", "People are perfectly free to have their own thoughts. But speaking those words out loud is an action and actions have consequences. \n\nSpeaking offensive language should absolutely have consequences. Calling out shitty behavior should always happen. Bigots don't deserve to be comfortable. \n\nI have THOUGHT about killing someone numerous times, but have not ACTED on it. \n\nSpeaking hateful words IS NOT THE SAME as thinking them.", "Is it therefore wrong to feel and/or say, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in Transgendered.\u201d, or, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be around gay or black people?\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t bring myself to say someone that holds these views is wrong, I just say, not my kinda people, keep it moving.\n\nCountry music sucks. Shouldn\u2019t offend a country music fan. Just let me talk shit on it if I want lol."]}
