I know Reddit finds pets a VERY intense topic, but it\u2019s cruel to bring a dog into a home where it won\u2019t be loved or looked after - and your house sounds like both. \n\nHold strong on this one or you will be back outside in the freezing cold waiting for the dog to poop, wondering how the hell this happened again.", "NTA.  She hasn't even done the basics of pet ownership.  Expect someone else to do all the work while you get all the fun.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks that you need to parent your partner though. My condolences.", "Not wanting something and standing up for yourself is not AH behavior. \n\nTrying to make someone else do things you want to do against their will is AH behavior. \n\nYour wife is backwards here. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You said you wouldn't stand in her way, but you wouldn't be doing all the work again. This is a reasonable boundary. And even if you plan to help a little, I would keep that to yourself because she needs to decide to take responsibility first. \n\n(And she should maybe consider that an older housebroken dog isn't as much trouble as a puppy.)", "I told my husband that if he wants a dog, he will have to walk it 100% of the time. He thought about it \u2026 and didn\u2019t get a dog.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  But you know she'll promise to look after it, and then you'll have an untrained dog in your house...", "NTA\n\nYour partner sounds like a person who just grew up in a house full of animals, but never had to actually take care of them. If most of the work REALLY has been put on your shoulders then she's clearly not responsible enough to make decision on getting another pet, especially a young one. You have 100% right to say no to getting an animal that will end up your responsibility. \n\nAnd, frankly, you shouldn't agree to getting another pet even if she promises she'll take care of it herself becauce I don't really believe she will. Most probably she will slowly break you down over time, or just neglect the poor thing.", "Nta my fiance has a dream dog so I told him I have two conditions, he needs to save up the amount of money for the dog and the surgery since the breed is notorious for having to have a nasal surgery and he has to do most of the work for the dog because I've had animals continuously since I was 5 and I'm burnt out", "NTA You\u2019re allowed to make boundaries. She\u2019s been taking advantage of you. If you\u2019d like to try a compromise, you could agree to take the dog on a walk once a week, and agree to take care of it if she\u2019s sick or out of town. But don\u2019t promise more than that. If you need to, create a contract you\u2019ll both go by that clearly states her jobs vs your jobs. And if she sees that as a pros-cons list, then that says a lot about her\u2026", "NTA. A pet should be an all or nothing situation. If one doesn\u2019t agree you shouldn\u2019t get it. Also if she wants the dog she should put the work in. But we both know if she gets it...she will expect you to cave. And you will.", "NTA.\n\nThough I would have offered a caveat that if she was extremely ill, I might be willing to help out but that if she gets extremely ill for a long time, you'll rehome the animal because again, you are done regularly caring for any more pets at least for the time being.", "So she wants a pet without the responsibility that comes with a pet. \n\nOP, you're not at fault. NTA \n\nShe's the AH.", "Lots of pets over a 7 year period sounds like a lot to go through? I\u2019m just a little suspicious as if they\u2019ve had cats and dogs before, 7 years is less than the average lifespan. So to have lots and for them to have all died within 7 years is strange.", "I didn\u2019t even make that connection! Info OP - what was the pet species count?", "I made an edit from your comment they were all older shelter animals"]}
