Her mother and I separated when she twelve and we split everything evenly and always paid half and half for her camp. We never intended on it being a longterm thing but she made friends and they always looked forward to seeing each other every summer.\n\nBack in October of 2021 I came home to my daughter with a friend I never seen before. She introduces her as her friend from camp. She was in the area because her family was going to Disney World. Her and my daughter were very excited to see each other but I was a bit apprehensive about having a stranger in the home but she stayed overnight sometimes.\n\nOne day I was cleaning through my room and I realized I couldnt find an envelope I got from the bank a few days prior. After tearing apart the house and not finding it I concluded it must have been my daughters camp \u201cfriend\u201d. I never lose stuff and I lose money the few days a stranger from across the country has been in my house? I was livid and when my daughter finally came back I asked her about it and she told me to lower my voice her friend was coming in as well and they didnt see it. I confronted her friend who got overly upset saying her family is wealthy and she doesnt need money and my daughter was defending her saying that they never were apart so there was no way she could have.\n\nRegardless I told her she wasnt invited inside and had to leave. This caused a huge argument with my daughter who didn't speak to me for weeks after saying Im disgusting. She wouldnt even agree to our custody agreement and stayed at her mothers house for months. We eventually started talking but it was awkward and short. In the summer of 2022 her mother asked me to pay for her half for summer camp and I refused. Why would I pay to board my daughter with a thief? This caused another huge fight and my ex paid for it all that summer. My daughter hasnt spoken to me since and refuses to come over.\n\nI decided to sell my car recently and before I sold it I did a deep clean and ended up finding the envelope in my trunk. I was so confused about how it got there but was relieved to find it. I felt terrible about the situation with my daughter so I texted her letting her know I found the money and that Im sorry. We spoke and she said that she wants me to say sorry to her friend on a three way call (which I did) and my daughter said to make up for it I need to pay for ALL of her camp like her mother did last year when I refused. I was taken aback and said no, Id pay for just half. She got upset again saying its the least I could do after I refused to pay last summer over money I misplaced after blaming her friend and embarrasing her and Im a huge asshole? AITA?!

Your only reasoning was essentially that you couldn't possibly be at fault because evidently you don't think it reasonable to consider that you might have made a boneheaded mistake and put the envelope somewhere stupid.  Nevermind that it was still overwhelmingly likely that you HAD misplaced it, and you should have torn everything apart looking for the envelope before making serious accusations against *a child*.  Nope, you jumped right to making accusations.\n\nThen your ex had to cover your share of camp last year because you were still making baseless accusations with no evidence.  \n\nIf you want to stick to 50/50, then you owe your ex for last year because she covered your share.  Or you could just pay the entire amount this year.  \n\nYou made a ton of massive mistakes here, and you want to pretend like none of them happened.  Not how it works.  You need to own up to your mistakes and make them right, part of that is paying for what your ex covered last year because it was a *mistake* to make those accusations and not pay.  Maybe then you'll learn that you DO make mistakes and in the future you'll consider that you could be at fault before accusing children of taking things you misplaced.", "YTA.  You jumped to a conclusion, didn't trust your daughter when she said it wasn't possible, refused to help pay to send her to camp with a \"thief\".  I\"m glad you apologized to the girl, but the least you can do is pony up the whole amount next year.", "YTA big time man. You treated your kids friend like crap with no proof of any wrongdoing, refused to pay your fair share for camp putting a financial burden on your ex over this, and even now that you KNOW you were in the wrong you\u2019re not going to do the bare minimum to make up for that?", "YTA\n\nYour ego is going to ruin your relationship with your daughter. Pay for camp and keep it pushing. Is this the hill you really want to die on with your daughter and ex?", "YTA \n\nWhat your daughter asked is fair. Last year, your ex paid the full amount for that camp and now you need to pay in full to make it even.\n\nYou can get back to the 50:50 arrangement with your ex the next year onwards.\n\nTo settle the issue, you never had proof who took your envelope and anyway you found it in your car trunk.

Paying for camp is the smallest step you can take to try to start to make amends for all of the above.", "YTA\n\n  I hope this is a throw away account. \nThe fact that you even needed to ask this question is embarrassing. \n\nYou also owe your daughter a second apology.", "YTA. Honestly, I feel like paying for all of it is a good compromise since her mom payed for it last year (it's like each payed for half over the 2 year period). Also is this the hill you want to die on and risk your relationship with your daughter?", "YTA\n\nPay for the camp.

But to make it right (after the apology) would be restoring the previous status quo so if Mum paid last year (on the back of your now acknowledged mistake) the status quo is you pay this year.", "You set the bar for being TA. You jumped to an incorrect conclusion about a child stealing from you with no proof whatsoever and embarrassed your daughter over it. This could have had a knock on affect for her being able to make any future friends at the camp if they knew her dad could accuse them of a crime if they came to visit her.\n\nNot only that but you punished the daughter by not paying for her to go to camp, only luckily her mom could cover the whole cost.\n\nYou should be trying to show how sorry you are and trying to make amends!!

In fact, I think you should also do something for the girl you accused of stealing. Sending a nice gift with your daughter for her. Since they are friends, you daughter might know what she would like. Keep it a reasonable amount of course, but it would go a long way to show your repentance for the false accusations.

Come on.", "Massive YTA. \n\nYou were wrong every step of the way here. You have a lot of work to do to rebuild the relationship with your kid.

You were irresponsible and misplaced it. Your own daughter said they hadn\u2019t separated so she couldn\u2019t have done it. Your ex then paid the entire camp.

Do you really not trust your daughter\u2019s judgement of character at all?

And your reasoning for not paying last year is childish.", "YTA you called someone a thief and kicked the child out of your house when you were at fault.
