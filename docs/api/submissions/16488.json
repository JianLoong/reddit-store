Her mother and I separated when she twelve and we split everything evenly and always paid half and half for her camp. We never intended on it being a longterm thing but she made friends and they always looked forward to seeing each other every summer.\n\nBack in October of 2021 I came home to my daughter with a friend I never seen before. She introduces her as her friend from camp. She was in the area because her family was going to Disney World. Her and my daughter were very excited to see each other but I was a bit apprehensive about having a stranger in the home but she stayed overnight sometimes.\n\nOne day I was cleaning through my room and I realized I couldnt find an envelope I got from the bank a few days prior. After tearing apart the house and not finding it I concluded it must have been my daughters camp \u201cfriend\u201d. I never lose stuff and I lose money the few days a stranger from across the country has been in my house? I was livid and when my daughter finally came back I asked her about it and she told me to lower my voice her friend was coming in as well and they didnt see it. I confronted her friend who got overly upset saying her family is wealthy and she doesnt need money and my daughter was defending her saying that they never were apart so there was no way she could have.\n\nRegardless I told her she wasnt invited inside and had to leave. This caused a huge argument with my daughter who didn't speak to me for weeks after saying Im disgusting. She wouldnt even agree to our custody agreement and stayed at her mothers house for months. We eventually started talking but it was awkward and short. In the summer of 2022 her mother asked me to pay for her half for summer camp and I refused. Why would I pay to board my daughter with a thief? This caused another huge fight and my ex paid for it all that summer. My daughter hasnt spoken to me since and refuses to come over.\n\nI decided to sell my car recently and before I sold it I did a deep clean and ended up finding the envelope in my trunk. I was so confused about how it got there but was relieved to find it. I felt terrible about the situation with my daughter so I texted her letting her know I found the money and that Im sorry. We spoke and she said that she wants me to say sorry to her friend on a three way call (which I did) and my daughter said to make up for it I need to pay for ALL of her camp like her mother did last year when I refused. I was taken aback and said no, Id pay for just half. She got upset again saying its the least I could do after I refused to pay last summer over money I misplaced after blaming her friend and embarrasing her and Im a huge asshole? AITA?!

Your only reasoning was essentially that you couldn't possibly be at fault because evidently you don't think it reasonable to consider that you might have made a boneheaded mistake and put the envelope somewhere stupid.  Nevermind that it was still overwhelmingly likely that you HAD misplaced it, and you should have torn everything apart looking for the envelope before making serious accusations against *a child*.  Nope, you jumped right to making accusations.\n\nThen your ex had to cover your share of camp last year because you were still making baseless accusations with no evidence.  \n\nIf you want to stick to 50/50, then you owe your ex for last year because she covered your share.  Or you could just pay the entire amount this year.  \n\nYou made a ton of massive mistakes here, and you want to pretend like none of them happened.  Not how it works.  You need to own up to your mistakes and make them right, part of that is paying for what your ex covered last year because it was a *mistake* to make those accusations and not pay.  Maybe then you'll learn that you DO make mistakes and in the future you'll consider that you could be at fault before accusing children of taking things you misplaced.", "YTA.  You jumped to a conclusion, didn't trust your daughter when she said it wasn't possible, refused to help pay to send her to camp with a \"thief\".  I\"m glad you apologized to the girl, but the least you can do is pony up the whole amount next year.", "YTA big time man. You treated your kids friend like crap with no proof of any wrongdoing, refused to pay your fair share for camp putting a financial burden on your ex over this, and even now that you KNOW you were in the wrong you\u2019re not going to do the bare minimum to make up for that?", "YTA\n\nYour ego is going to ruin your relationship with your daughter. Pay for camp and keep it pushing. Is this the hill you really want to die on with your daughter and ex?", "YTA \n\nWhat your daughter asked is fair. Last year, your ex paid the full amount for that camp and now you need to pay in full to make it even.\n\nYou can get back to the 50:50 arrangement with your ex the next year onwards.\n\nTo settle the issue, you never had proof who took your envelope and anyway you found it in your car trunk.

Paying for camp is the smallest step you can take to try to start to make amends for all of the above.", "YTA\n\n  I hope this is a throw away account. \nThe fact that you even needed to ask this question is embarrassing. \n\nYou also owe your daughter a second apology.", "YTA. Honestly, I feel like paying for all of it is a good compromise since her mom payed for it last year (it's like each payed for half over the 2 year period).

You jumped to an incorrect conclusion about a child stealing from you with no proof whatsoever and embarrassed your daughter over it. This could have had a knock on affect for her being able to make any future friends at the camp if they knew her dad could accuse them of a crime if they came to visit her.\n\nNot only that but you punished the daughter by not paying for her to go to camp, only luckily her mom could cover the whole cost.\n\nYou should be trying to show how sorry you are and trying to make amends!!

In fact, I think you should also do something for the girl you accused of stealing. Sending a nice gift with your daughter for her. Since they are friends, you daughter might know what she would like. Keep it a reasonable amount of course, but it would go a long way to show your repentance for the false accusations.

Come on.", "Massive YTA. \n\nYou were wrong every step of the way here. You have a lot of work to do to rebuild the relationship with your kid.

Do you really not trust your daughter\u2019s judgement of character at all?

And your reasoning for not paying last year is childish.", "YTA you called someone a thief and kicked the child out of your house when you were at fault.

Now you are doubling down and still refusing to pay your share.", "You have two options here:\n\n1) pay for the camp in full because you owe your ex for last year\u2019s and you fucked up. So actions meet consequences \n\n2) you don\u2019t pay because your giant ass ego can\u2019t fathom that you were wrong and you have to make up for it and lose your daughter FOREVER because she is never trusting you again if you don\u2019t GENUINELY make up for it and you will have lost her because your head so far up your ass you can hear your own heartbeat", "The reason I didnt pay the summer before was justified with the information I had then. Her camp friend from across the country was over at my house the same time I lose money. So now knowing what I know, I only feel like it\u2019s necessary to pay for my half since for all I knew, she was living with a thief.", "Agreed with all of this. And I'm wondering if the friend a minority as well. YTA. Also look deep inside yourself about why you just went right to accusing the friend. Cuz this has serious racist undertones that raised my alarm as a black guy. I often was accused of stealing things when I was a kid", "Wouldnt making up for it mean apologizing like I did and paying my half as normal? I didnt pay last year because I genuinely believed for her friend stole it. I would have felt horrible sending my daughter to stay with someone that robbed her father. It made sense then.", "Lol, is this guy downvoting everyone who rules against him?", "OP really must be. I don\u2019t even think OP expected to be found TA. And I don\u2019t think OP is going to change their actions. I think OP os still going to stick with the plan of only paying half because of their fragile ego. And continue to damage their relationship with their daughter.", "> So now knowing what I know, I only feel like it\u2019s necessary to pay for my half since for all I knew, she was living with a thief.\n\nThat makes no sense. \n\nAlthough your belief before was sincere, it was also WRONG. And you now know that with absolute certainty. So you now know that you were wrong to refuse to pay for half of last year's camp - that decision was based on incorrect info and assumptions. In essence you have a debt to your ex for 1/2 of last year's bill because your refusal to pay was in error.\n\nEither send half the money for last year, or pay for all of this year's camp.", "You were not justified because you had no information.  You had a **suspicion**.  A suspicion you now know was without a doubt wrong.", "You had no proof so no, you were not justified. Know that you know you accused an innocent person of a crime and punished your daughter over it, any decent person would own up to their mistakes and make it right this year.\n\nIf that isn't enough for you, then consider the very real possibility that you will never have a good relationship with your daughter if you don't.\n\nYTA", "Whether you found it justified then or not, you were wrong and you have to make up for that major F up.", "You wrongfully convicted her friend as being a thief.  That isn\u2019t justified.  \n\nIf you want to rebuild a relationship with your daughter - you should do what she asks.  But it\u2019s fine - she\u2019ll probably just not come over still", "You used your \"suspicion\" which proved groundless to get out of paying for half of camp.

You are solidifying YTA", "You didn\u2019t have any information other than you lost an envelope!  Couldn\u2019t possibly be you could it? Must have been someone else. \n\nYTA for being the kind of person who immediately blames others without any evidence.\n\nAnd punching down on a child is disgusting and speaks to who you are as a person. Your daughter knows you are an asshole, that will stick with her. No going back now. She sees you for who you really are for her lifetime now. Enjoy that.", "Well she will be next time she visits you.", "And know your daughter knows that she's living with an azzhat AND a thief who won't repay the money owned to the ex- for the previous year (by taking over this year's entire payment).\n\nIf that's how you want people to view you... \\*shrug\\*\n\nYTA", "Your thought is like guilty before proven innocent - in America it's innocent until proven guilty......", "No, there\u2019s no justification for what you did.

Cause that\u2019s where you are headed!", "You didn't have any information though. \n\nYou presumed. \n\nAnd apparently didn't do a thorough job of searching your home and car before accusing a child of theft. \n\nSo you were only justified in your mind. \n\nYou either need to pay this year in full or pay your kid's mom the half she paid last year. \n\nBecause...YOU WERE WRONG.", "[removed]", "You made an assumption and based your actions on that assumption \nThat assumption has been proven wrong and now you have to make up for the actions you wrongly took that hurt everyone else \nAnd no, paying your half for one year like you should doesn\u2019t make up for not paying half another year.", "Dude think of it this way: you have a recurring bill but you refuse to pay it because you think it\u2019s a mistake. You come to find out it\u2019s correct so next month you only agree to pay for the current month. Logically you\u2019d be taken To court over outstanding payments right? And no arguing that you didn\u2019t know makes the bill go away. \n\nIf this were an actual bill in court you\u2019d be paying interest so you might not want to be arguing with the judge (your child).", "Now you know you were wrong and need to make it right with all three of them, your kid, her friend, and your ex-wife, by paying the full amount for this year's camp since you reneged on your portion two years ago.\n\nAnd maybe not jump to conclusions next time until you've exhausted all other possibilities.\n\nBut I feel like you just came here to be told you weren't the asshole and the odds are definitely not in your favor.  Time to make the effort if you want a positive relationship with your kid going forward.", "Except she wasn\u2019t living with a thief. You assumed a child stole from you without any evidence. You\u2019re a sorry excuse for a parent and better be prepared for the relationship with your daughter to suffer.", "No, now you do the right thing since you now have the right information and you pay your half from when you had the WRONG information and jumped to conclusions.  You make things right or you will forever be YTA, especially in the eyes of your daughter. Unless you care more about the money then that??????", "And you are wrong. You also wronged your ex through your actions and to make amends would be paying the full amount.", "YTA even my kids who are under 10 know that saying you\u2019re sorry is only part of an apology. \u201cSaying I\u2019m sorry is the first step, then how can I help\u201d Daniel Tiger teaches that to toddlers! You said I\u2019m sorry and your daughter told you how you can help and you refuse to do it. So to her you aren\u2019t actually sorry. Actions speak louder than words and you can\u2019t return to the way it was until you make up for your screw up. Yes, you thought the kid was a thief but what about innocent until proven guilty?", "You believed incorrectly, so your not paying wasn\u2019t justified. Your ex is still out that money so you haven\u2019t made that up. Best solution is to pay the full amount this year and go back to splitting it in the future.", ">paying my half as normal? \n\nAwesome, reimburse your wife for the half she covered this time, then you split it going forward as normal.", "Maybe it didn't make sense to you then, but now that you know you're wrong and feel you should go back to the original agreement - don't you think you owe your ex 50% of the fee from last year?", "A lame apology doesn't make up for your daughter and her friend missing out. What do they have to gain by cheap words?", "Yes but you found out her friend didn't, you falsely accused her and you punished your daughter effectively by not sending her to camp. This breach in your arrangements due to your false allegations cost your ex. Restitution time. Don't you feel terrible that you upset two children and financially damaged your ex because you assumed? It makes sense to compensate her now for the fact she paid full amount last year.", "No. You're missing a key step in the process here. It's called restitution. Making up for where your wrongful actions caused harm to the other party.\n\nPaying your agreed 50% this year does **not** make up for the fact that you failed to pay any last year, and your ex was out money she should not have been. The fact that you genuinely believed what you did does not mean squat when what you believed was flat wrong.\n\nIf you actually want to make up for your pig-headed behavior (no disrespect meant to Porky, Petunia, and the rest of the porcine community), you'll pay your 50% this year plus the 50% you owe from last year. If you want to actually be smart, you'll also pay interest on that 50% from last year to make up for the extra expense your ex incurred unnecessarily... even if that ends up being more than the full cost of camp this year.\n\nThat would be making it up to them. Or a good start on it at least.\n\nOh, and it is quite sad that your teenage daughter has a better understanding of this than you do.", "no you still owe your ex half the money from last year.", ">I didnt pay last year because I genuinely believed for her friend stole it\n\nand you were\n\n# WRONG\n\nso pay.", "No. Making up for it would be reimbursing mom for your missing half last year and then paying 50% thus year. Or cut out the middle man and pay 100% this year.", ">>I would have felt horrible sending my daughter to stay with someone that robbed her father.\n\nWell, you ended up wrongly accusing a *child* and attempting to deprive your daughter of something she loves instead. Sure, apologizing is a necessary first step, but given the fact you lashed out at a child and allowed your false and completely unfounded accusation to nearly destroy your relationship with your daughter, you *know* an apology isn\u2019t nearly enough.", "The RIGHT thing would have been trusting your daughter when she told you she was with her friend and so you were wrong. You accused a CHILD of a crime when, in fact, YOU lost the envelope. Then you made her mom pay YOUR half of the camp money.  You need to own the horrible way you betrayed your own child and do as she asks and either pay her mom back for last year's half and pay your half this year OR pay the whole amount this year.  \n\nYTA 100% here -- make it right or you'll never regain your daughter's trust. (I'd include a nice care package of snacks and treats for your daughter to bring to camp for her friend as well.", "You genuinely believed a lie that YOU made up yourself with no evidence, which has been proven to be completely false. You screwed this situation up from beginning to end and no one else is responsible but you. Your belief may have been genuine, but it was not reasonable, and nothing about your reaction now makes any sense. YTA.", "An apology without restitution is just empty words. Are you sure you are really sorry? Then show it by making things right. \n\nPaying for half as normal is just the status quo and in no way makes up for your ex paying for the whole thing last time.

Apologize to anyone who may have been hurt (physically or emotionally)\n\n2. Do your best to fix or replace anything broken or lost\n\n3. Do your best to avoid similar mistakes in the future \n\nIf you do those three steps, you can move on and put your mistake in the past.\n\nYou\u2019ve only done step 1. You have more work to do.

They wouldn't need to make things right?", "Except it didn\u2019t even make sense then. You never had any evidence that her friend stole from you. You just decided that it was more likely that a child stole from you and your daughter lied to you about it than that you misplaced an envelope. You then used this as justification to weasel out of your financial obligations. You are now demonstrably wrong but still trying to shift the financial burden to your ex. Pay her back what you should have paid last year.", "Nope. You owe your ex for last year. Either pay her what you didnt or pay for this year in full. You dont get away with just an apology.", "You\u2019re an objectively stupid human being.  Or just super cheap looking for an excuse not to pay.  Probably both.  YTA", "OP a quick google shows that part of apologizing properly is to \u201cIf it\u2019s relevant, make reparations\u201d you have learned that you **were wrong** now it\u2019s time to buck up and **make it right** and fix the mistakes you made. This was not a one and done situation, this was an almost **two year** long repetition of your wrong. Not only did you wrong your daughters friend when you first accused her, but again every time you doubled down. Then you offended your daughter by not believing her when she said her friend couldn\u2019t have done it because they were together **and every time after that you refused to believe her and insulted both her integrity and her friend**. Oh but I\u2019m not done, then you tried to **punish your daughter for your own mistake** I don\u2019t care if you thought her friend did it or not, **she didn\u2019t** and besides you are supposed to be the **parent** and parents don\u2019t **punish their children for something their friend did**.
