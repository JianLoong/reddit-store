Her mother and I separated when she twelve and we split everything evenly and always paid half and half for her camp. We never intended on it being a longterm thing but she made friends and they always looked forward to seeing each other every summer.\n\nBack in October of 2021 I came home to my daughter with a friend I never seen before. She introduces her as her friend from camp. She was in the area because her family was going to Disney World. Her and my daughter were very excited to see each other but I was a bit apprehensive about having a stranger in the home but she stayed overnight sometimes.\n\nOne day I was cleaning through my room and I realized I couldnt find an envelope I got from the bank a few days prior. After tearing apart the house and not finding it I concluded it must have been my daughters camp \u201cfriend\u201d. I never lose stuff and I lose money the few days a stranger from across the country has been in my house? I was livid and when my daughter finally came back I asked her about it and she told me to lower my voice her friend was coming in as well and they didnt see it. I confronted her friend who got overly upset saying her family is wealthy and she doesnt need money and my daughter was defending her saying that they never were apart so there was no way she could have.\n\nRegardless I told her she wasnt invited inside and had to leave. This caused a huge argument with my daughter who didn't speak to me for weeks after saying Im disgusting. She wouldnt even agree to our custody agreement and stayed at her mothers house for months. We eventually started talking but it was awkward and short. In the summer of 2022 her mother asked me to pay for her half for summer camp and I refused. Why would I pay to board my daughter with a thief? This caused another huge fight and my ex paid for it all that summer. My daughter hasnt spoken to me since and refuses to come over.\n\nI decided to sell my car recently and before I sold it I did a deep clean and ended up finding the envelope in my trunk. I was so confused about how it got there but was relieved to find it. I felt terrible about the situation with my daughter so I texted her letting her know I found the money and that Im sorry. We spoke and she said that she wants me to say sorry to her friend on a three way call (which I did) and my daughter said to make up for it I need to pay for ALL of her camp like her mother did last year when I refused. I was taken aback and said no, Id pay for just half. She got upset again saying its the least I could do after I refused to pay last summer over money I misplaced after blaming her friend and embarrasing her and Im a huge asshole? AITA?!

Your only reasoning was essentially that you couldn't possibly be at fault because evidently you don't think it reasonable to consider that you might have made a boneheaded mistake and put the envelope somewhere stupid.  Nevermind that it was still overwhelmingly likely that you HAD misplaced it, and you should have torn everything apart looking for the envelope before making serious accusations against *a child*.  Nope, you jumped right to making accusations.\n\nThen your ex had to cover your share of camp last year because you were still making baseless accusations with no evidence.  \n\nIf you want to stick to 50/50, then you owe your ex for last year because she covered your share.  Or you could just pay the entire amount this year.  \n\nYou made a ton of massive mistakes here, and you want to pretend like none of them happened.  Not how it works.  You need to own up to your mistakes and make them right, part of that is paying for what your ex covered last year because it was a *mistake* to make those accusations and not pay.  Maybe then you'll learn that you DO make mistakes and in the future you'll consider that you could be at fault before accusing children of taking things you misplaced.", "YTA.  You jumped to a conclusion, didn't trust your daughter when she said it wasn't possible, refused to help pay to send her to camp with a \"thief\".  I\"m glad you apologized to the girl, but the least you can do is pony up the whole amount next year.", "YTA big time man. You treated your kids friend like crap with no proof of any wrongdoing, refused to pay your fair share for camp putting a financial burden on your ex over this, and even now that you KNOW you were in the wrong you\u2019re not going to do the bare minimum to make up for that?", "YTA\n\nYour ego is going to ruin your relationship with your daughter. Pay for camp and keep it pushing. Is this the hill you really want to die on with your daughter and ex?", "YTA \n\nWhat your daughter asked is fair. Last year, your ex paid the full amount for that camp and now you need to pay in full to make it even.\n\nYou can get back to the 50:50 arrangement with your ex the next year onwards.\n\nTo settle the issue, you never had proof who took your envelope and anyway you found it in your car trunk.

Paying for camp is the smallest step you can take to try to start to make amends for all of the above.", "YTA\n\n  I hope this is a throw away account. \nThe fact that you even needed to ask this question is embarrassing. \n\nYou also owe your daughter a second apology.", "YTA. Honestly, I feel like paying for all of it is a good compromise since her mom payed for it last year (it's like each payed for half over the 2 year period).

You jumped to an incorrect conclusion about a child stealing from you with no proof whatsoever and embarrassed your daughter over it. This could have had a knock on affect for her being able to make any future friends at the camp if they knew her dad could accuse them of a crime if they came to visit her.\n\nNot only that but you punished the daughter by not paying for her to go to camp, only luckily her mom could cover the whole cost.\n\nYou should be trying to show how sorry you are and trying to make amends!!

In fact, I think you should also do something for the girl you accused of stealing. Sending a nice gift with your daughter for her. Since they are friends, you daughter might know what she would like. Keep it a reasonable amount of course, but it would go a long way to show your repentance for the false accusations.

Come on.", "Massive YTA. \n\nYou were wrong every step of the way here. You have a lot of work to do to rebuild the relationship with your kid.

Do you really not trust your daughter\u2019s judgement of character at all?

And your reasoning for not paying last year is childish.", "YTA you called someone a thief and kicked the child out of your house when you were at fault.

Who cares what you thought, you were wrong and and asshole.", "And you were wrong, so you need to fix your mistake for forcing her mother to pay for your share. \n\nJust because you were a bonehead doesn't mean they should pay for your stupidity.", "But you were WRONG, you numpty", "So you wanted to deprive your daughter of the entire experience of camp and friends because you believed but had no proof someone stole from you. Your ex wife had to pick up for yout slack and instead of making it right and paying her back because you were in the wrong you dig your heels in? You sound like a child.", "and you were wrong you need to pay back ex or pay full camp", "Making up for it would mean making the other parties whole- which means paying back your ex.", "No. You owe restitution. You made a huge mistake. It was 100% your own fault. Pay up.", "No wonder you got divorced", "Nope. Because due to you\u2019re embarrassingly incompetent behavior your ex had to pay your share. Why? Because you attacked a child with no proof", "YTA  \nYou were genuinely wrong is what you were. And you owe last year's half so you should pay it all this year. And that only brings it up to even, so that would be you getting off easy.\n\nYou're very very awful.", "Dear IRS,\nLast year I misunderstood the tax law and I legitimately thought I didn't owe any taxes. This year I found out I was wrong. I'm sorry. But since I apologized, and I truly believed I didn't owe anything, I don't have to pay it now, right? Right??", "You may have believed it, but you were wrong. So making up for being wrong and acting on your incorrect assumptions means fixing what you did. Your ex had to pay your share last year because of your actions, which were not correct, so now you pay her share to even things back out. \n\nWhat isn\u2019t making sense for you here?", "You had zero information like absolutely none minus\n\n \"I never misplaced anything because I'm so great at being an adult and a parent so I yelled at a child and accused them of being a their because I KNEW THEY STOLE IT.\"\n\nCongrats sir you alone have changed the relationship dynamic between you and your daughter.\n\nBecause you misplaced your things.\n\nGood job dad way to go.", "No it was not justified.  You were wrong.   She was not living with a thief.  You are a giant AH.  \nDon\u2019t be surprised when she goes no contact.", "> I didnt pay the summer before was justified with the information I had then\n\n**You weren't justified at all,** you had no information other than a missing envelope!  \n\nYou had no information or proof that anyone, let alone your daughters friend, had stolen the envelope.\n\nYou went of full-cocked for absolutely no reason.  I don't blame your daughter for not wanting to stay with you.  Its a wonder she even wants to speak to you.\n\nAnd YES YTA - you should pay the full cost for the summer camp", "Except it wasn't justified. You had justified it to yourself, sure, but you now know the reality of it. You accused someone wrongfully of theft and withheld your half of an already agreed upon payment based on falsehoods. You need to make the situation whole.\n\nLet's just use a nice round number for simplicity's sake, and say camp costs $200 per year. You pay $100, your ex pays $100. Equal and fair. Now sure, in the grand scheme of things, paying an extra $100 once isn't likely to absolutely ruin anyone financially, but you agreed to split costs 50/50. There was not a \"you can't believe someone who isn't me in a disagreement\" clause to that. Your ex would still be down $100 compared to you. In order to keep things 50/50 and fair, it's on *you* to do that. Whether it's just shouldering that $100 yourself or paying your ex the $100 you withheld last year, that's on you.\n\nYou cannot keep using a fictional crime as your justification for a real world injustice.", "So let\u2019s pretend another adult, someone you respect, thinks you took something from them. You tell them you didn\u2019t. You provide a witness that says you couldn\u2019t have. They don\u2019t believe you. They go take $100 from your wallet to repay themselves for the thing you took. \n\nThey find the thing the next day. Do they get to keep your money? They were justified in taking it if they truly believed you stole something of equal value from them! \n\n*Yes, them just taking your $100 is probably illegal regardless, but you blew off your agreement with your wife when you refused to pay your share of your daughter\u2019s activities, so you\u2019re clearly willing to blow off rules (or violate your custody agreement-it\u2019s unclear whether this was a formal or informal arrangement) when you think it\u2019s justified.", "It wasn't justified. The information you had was you misplaced your cash and, being a jerk, accused your kid's friend for no reason, other than her presence. \n\nYTA. You owe your ex half of last year's camp and will be lucky if she doesn't haul you to court; she'll be going to court to change custody now that your daughter knows you think you're perfect and shouldn't have to rectify your error", "No it wasn't justified. You had no information that showed this child stole your money! Stop placing blame where it doesn't belong. You had no justification at all. YTA", "You didn\u2019t know anything the summer before, you made assumptions, that were proved to be wrong. Those assumptions make you a huge AH.", "You literally had NO INFORMATION!  Instead, you jumped to a bone headed conclusion to something that turned out to be YOUR MISTAKE.  You will be TA squared if you don\u2019t pay for your daughter\u2019s camp.", "No. You weren\u2019t justified. You were just believing what you wanted to", "Ok BUT YOU WERE WRONG \n\nYou seem to have a hard time admitting that \n\nThe information you had WAS WRONG\n\nAnd you decided not to pay your share for something YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT \n\nSo do the right thing and pay for the whole camp \n\nThink of it as repaying your share from last year- you know- the time you didn\u2019t pay because of something YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT?", "No. You backed out on your agreement for your daughter because in the absence of information you blamed a child for your incompetence. YTA for even thinking her friend stole anything. Then you punished your daughter for your incompetence while blaming her friend with zero proof.", "You had no information though! Just assumptions and the inability to believe you could be wrong!", "Do you not understand what friends are? Just because you hadn't met her yet means nothing. She wasn't a stranger to your daughter. She was your daughter's friend. It is pure idiocy to jump to blaming her. Do you sneer at all of your kid's friends the same way?  \n\nYou were NOT justified. You were gross and wrong.", "But now you know you were fucking wrong!!", "You had absolutely no \u201cinformation\u201d then, OP. You had a baseless accusation that sounds bizarre. \n\nThen you received proof that your baseless accusation was definitively wrong. You need to take a long slow look at yourself. If these are the things you willingly admit to, I can\u2019t even imagine what else is happening in your head.", "You were wrong. Making up for it means going above and beyond to show that. You should be sending these girls to Disney, for a mistake of this magnitude. You robbed yourself of months of your daughter's life over nothing.", "Even if we accept that you were \"justified\" - which you weren't, you made a leap of logic that could've cleared the grand canyon based on literally 0 evidence of any kind, but for the sake of argument let's say you were - you now know you were wrong. So now that you know that, you are now responsible for correcting the actions you took based on your incorrect assumption. Which means making your ex-wife whole for the camp cost you skipped and forced her to shoulder alone, since you would not have withheld the funds if you hadn't gotten it in your head that your daughter's friend was a thief. You can either write her a check for your half of last year, or pay for 100% of this year to catch up the contribution you missed due to your tantrum. Anything less than that is only perpetuating your unfair actions, since you now know that those actions were NOT justified.", "No. You weren\u2019t \u201cjustified\u201d. \n\nYou were full of crap and making baseless accusations. You had *zero* proof! \n\nAnd guess what baby!  *YOU* were careless.  YOU messed up. This is 110% on you. \n\nWhat better punishment for YOU than to pay the whole cost, you have soooo many sins on your plate to atone for. This is the least you can do. \n\nOP\u2019s sins\n1. Being careless and losing his own money\n\n2.  Accusing someone with no proof. \n\n3.  Punishing his child and ex for his baseless, false accusations. \n\n4. Going against the custody/support agreement of paying for half. \n\n5.  Losing the money, *FOR TWO YEARS* \n\n6. Not bothering to *look* for the money or retrace your steps. \n\nJFC, adults don\u2019t do this stuff. This is a something a 7 year old would do.", "What? How was it justified? The \u201cinformation you had at the time\u201d was your assumption that the friend had stolen it. Not information, just your assumption. \n\nYour justification is ridiculous. You were wrong. You need to make it right.", "You still have a lot of growing up to do if you think you don't have to fix damage you've done just because you thought you were justified at the time to do it.", "Yeah. You do have plenty of first hand knowledge. My sympathy.", "IF **IF** on of them *had* stolen it\u2026it just as easily could have been his kid.  But he didn\u2019t even think that. Just went straight for the friend.", "I mean those are guesses people have based on their personal life experiences, not accusations. There's definitely no direct evidence of racism, but they're not saying that it's definitely the case and OP was *very* quick to point fingers at a child. It's frankly bizarre behavior and an underlying racial issue would explain a lot.", "Really? Cuz he jump straight to her stealing it despite there not being any evidence. His daughter said she was with her all that time. Like why jump straight to friend must have took it despite not knowing the friend well? Cuz he probably fell back on stereotypes. This also shows he don't trust the judgement of his own daughter if he thought she be friends with a thief.", "Reimburse your ex for YOUR share that she covered last year and then pay for this year's half. Or do as your daughter requested and pay all of this year's. It amounts to the same thing but whatever you need to do the right thing.", "Also, even if you were right, you were wrong to stop the payment last year. So what if there *had* been one dicey kid at camp? There's ALWAYS some dicey kids at camp. This was just an excuse because you were feeling sulky", "A fabricated suspicion at that", "This is the meanest thing I\u2019ve ever read on here and I love it.", "Cheap people aren\u2019t capable of embarrassment. \n\nThe OP isn\u2019t posting because he\u2019s embarrassed, he\u2019s posting because he was hoping to win an argument and regain some leverage against his daughter and his ex.", "Steal it all you want. I say it with all the bitterness in my slowly dying millennial heart. \ud83e\udd2a", "Wonderful! I know exactly when I\u2019m going to use it already \ud83d\ude02"]}
