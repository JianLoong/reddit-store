If I found out my significant other had a parent eavesdropping during personal, sensitive conversations, I'd be devastated. Sounds like your girlfriend might be under her mom's control and not be allowed to live her own life. I sympathize with her, but you shouldn't be expected to pay the price for that sick dynamic. You didn't sign up for secret non-consensual polyamory with her and her mom.", "NTA\n\nI would give your girlfriend the chance to explain to you in person one on one what exactly has been going on and I would ask exactly what has she been allowing her mom to listen to and why hasn't she told you.\n\nI'd reconsider moving forward whether you want a relationship with a person you can't trust.", "Absolutely NTA and that behavior is not normal by a long shot. I would reconsider the whole relationship by this point.", "NTA.\n\nIt is unclear to me how complicit your girlfriend was in this breach of your privacy.  She may have been all right with her mother listening in, or tt may be that her mother is overbearing, and she did not really have a choice in the matter, but even if that is the case, she should have said to you privately, \"Don't talk about private stuff over the phone because my mom insists on listening, and there is nothing I can do about it.\"\n\nEither way, this should be considered a warning for you if you decide to continue in the relationship.", "NTA. Of course you feel betrayed! Your current gf betrayed your trust and violated your privacy. I don't know how you can come back from this.", "NTA. Run, dude run. \n\nEither your girlfriend is complicit with her mum listening in, or she didn't care about it enough to tell you in person not to talk about private things on the phone. This is a huge betrayal of your trust.", "NTA, OP, get out, if the mom is that intrusive already and your Gf is ok with it aparently anf if you had not realize it they would still do it, this will colour any interaction you might have with her, move on, there is no trust.", "NTA. Any of us would have hung up in that situation. I would have a face to face and discuss boundaries and what happened. See how that goes before making further decisions.", "NTA.\n\n>both my girlfriend and her mom have been apologizing and trying to shift blame onto me\n\nThis is unforgivable. If you can't even trust your own gf to not exploit your most private and vulnerable secrets and weaponise them against you, you can't trust her at all... Ever.\n\nEven a grovelling apology isn't enough to make up for this disgusting betrayal, much less blaming you for their own scheme.", "NTA. Like never in a lifetime, break up with her and stay away from these kind of people. The way it was so easy for then to break somebody\u2019s trust is appalling. BREAK UP. You\u2019re dodging a massive bullet", "99.9% of the time, I think that anyone who hangs up on someone is wrong, and it is a pet peeve that I am usually willing to die on. You were not wrong. Your girlfriend and her mother are definitely wrong, and I think that it's very strange that Mom would spend any time eavesdropping on your relationship. This says a lot about your girlfriend's immaturity.\n\nNTA!!!!!", "I wouldn't necessarily end it immediately, but you do need to have a long conversation about how that's not okay to do, and how you will be able to trust her in the future. If it doesn't look like she's able to do that, either due to her own hang ups or due to a controlling mother, you may then have to pull the plug on the relationship.", "NTA \n\nYou should call back with some outlandish weird but believable story that you know Mama McSnoops-A-Lot will have to speak up when she hears it. Then when she does, open up with both barrels about invasion of privacy and tell them both what you think. \n\nThen say you are done with dating her and be clear to both of them that it\u2019s because of her mom\u2019s lack of respect for your privacy. Guilt trip both of them and don\u2019t allow them to get a word in edgewise. Then dump her and hang up. Mom and daughter both need called out in regards to their behavior.", "Nta block and move on with your life.", "NTA and the fact your GF did this I say end it. You'll save yourself misory later.

You are better for going No Contact with them.", "NTA\n\nShe betrayed your trust.the way to navigate this scenario is to leave her. I recommend a phone call. \n\n\"Hi Jane (and Joyce). I can't be with someone who exposes my private life to others. I did not sign up to date your mother.

I wish you the best.\" Click.", "NTA that was an awful breach of privacy in some of your most vulnerable moments. You\u2019d have every right not to trust your gf again.

If you're meant to be together, it can wait until she's 18, too.", "Nta. I know reddit is big on divorcing and breaking up, but in your case, actually break up. Because you are never recovering from this blow if you stay with this girl.", "Nta, I'd give your GF an ultimatum bro, that's really wrong of them", "NTA get a new gf", "NTA - that's such a violation of trust. I'm honestly not sure I would be able to get over that. There's no way of knowing how long she's been doing that and if she'd ever really stop. For me, it wouldn't be worth continuing the relationship because I could never trust her again.", "NTA, lose them both, that\u2019s childish", "NTA, if this happened to me it would be a deal breaker.  I wouldn\u2019t trust her or her mother again. I\u2019m just a super private person and don\u2019t trust easily.   I would hear your girlfriend out, but you are both young.  I don\u2019t know if this is something your girlfriend and mom always do, but it seems like either the girlfriend or her mom is not ready for girlfriend to have a relationship.", "Oh no Honey, NTA. Your so called girlfriend crossed a big ass line of trust with you. I dont see this relationship going forward.  Its a hard lesson to learn at your age but she cant be trusted not to share your darkest secrets with others. Time to kick her to the curb. Someone who truly loved you would never behave this way.", "NTA. Serious betrayal. Dump-worthy betrayal. It sounds like your girlfriend is being controlled by her mom, which is truly unfortunate, but unless you are willing to have this level of crazy as part of your life going forward, you need to move on.", "NTA Don't bother with her and break up and move on. No amount of justification is going to fix this.", "NTA I likely would have hung up too. Couples can work through trust betrayals, but it is work and you will need to decide if you\u2019re willing to put the effort into the relationship. \n\nIt sounds like there\u2019s some enmeshment happening between your girlfriend and her mother. If that\u2019s the case have a little grace for your girlfriend; she\u2019s still a teen and it can be hard for that to be worked on when you\u2019re still living with the parent.\n\nIf it\u2019s not enmeshment then your girlfriend may not have the maturity or experience to have these conversations with you. Learning how to manage big topics is hard and you\u2019re at the age where you\u2019ll fuck it up sometimes. \n\nUnderstanding motivations doesn\u2019t mean that you have to put up with the behaviour. If she is trying to shift the blame to you that isn\u2019t okay and doesn\u2019t leave room for repairing trust. \n\nI hope that you are able to learn and navigate this."]}
