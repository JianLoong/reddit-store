Any guidance on navigating this situation would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nEdit- I woke up an hour ago and watched all the comments come in while eating a whole ass margarita pizza. Thank you all for your advice and opinions. To provide more context:\n\nThroughout our relationship, my girlfriend has often joked about how her mom can get any information from her. However, I've witnessed firsthand how true this is lately. I've also noticed that my girlfriend doesn't respect privacy, claiming she needs a confidant because my situations are too much for her mentally, but then her mom knows everything I share in confidence. I also have tried not talking to her but she pushes every time. Because of this, I've become extremely cautious about sharing personal details.\n\nThey're both very religious, and while I share the same beliefs, it's been a contentious issue in our relationship. Her mom has used religion to justify intruding on my personal life, citing the need to guide me if I'm \"sinning.\"\n\nMy own family life has been challenging (I had to move out at 18 to escape). I talked to my own mother about all of this and her response was to say that it was not the worst thing and I was over reacting which is why I felt like posting. Her mom as expressed that she sees me as part of her family, which has led to her trying to control various aspects of my life, like dictating when I can drink coffee or imposing a bedtime. She's also shared my private struggles with her pastor and best friend, who've tried to intervene and \"fix\" me.\n\nI deeply care for my partner, but I can't envision a future where her mother's involvement is so intense in our lives. I plan to talk to her about this tonight and will update you all afterward.\n\n\nUpdate: She just called me at work. She started the conversation by saying she thinks we should probably break up because she can\u2019t do it anymore. I\u2019ll be honest, I snorted. She asked why, and I responded by asking her if it was because she was scared to talk to me face to face or if it was because she just didn\u2019t want to deal with the fact she screwed up and hurt me. She said it was because I say everything is her fault. \n\nFor context, I know I have a lot of problems because of a really hard home life and upbringing, and I acknowledge when I make mistakes. Last night was mostly me having to apologize and explain myself over and over. But this time, I flat out told her this was 1000% her and her mom\u2019s fault. I then had to go because I\u2019m at work and people needed help. I then got the texts saying things like, \u201cI guess this is all my fault\u201d and \u201cI deserve to sit in my consequences apparently.\u201d\n\nShe wants me to come to her house after work to sort things out. I think I am gonna see if we can meet ALONE in a public place to ensure privacy. I\u2019ll update after that.", "created_utc": 1701603006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189ro3c/aita_for_hanging_up_on_my_girlfriend_after_after/", "score": 1243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your so called girlfriend crossed a big ass line of trust with you. I dont see this relationship going forward.

Learning how to manage big topics is hard and you\u2019re at the age where you\u2019ll fuck it up sometimes. \n\nUnderstanding motivations doesn\u2019t mean that you have to put up with the behaviour.

Your gf sounds like she's dealing with a hell of a Mom based off this story and based off the result of them being caught. My best advice is to share this with your therapist, break up with the girl, and inform your parents tht a grown as women not only violated your privacy but then had the nerve to berate you for catching her. Time to heal and focus on yourself buddy. You have a bright future. And hopefully it's one that helps you grow once she out of the picture.\n\nP.s. your STBE should look into therapy herself... or some firm of help bc wtf", "NTA. \n\nI'd consider moving on.\n\nIf you stay, you'll just give yourself more issues which will impact your ability to trust a partner in future. Whereas if you leave, you accept that you were with someone who didn't value your privacy but you have the ability to find someone who will. \n\nWhen you hear about men and women talking about how they can't trust the opposite sex, it's because they usually end up trying to stay with people who keep betraying their trust.

That's awful.

No one wants to be spied on. So you are not an asshole in any event.  Whether you break up with her or not is up to you and depends on factors that we dont know and can't decide for you if we did.  You would be justified in breaking up certainly. \n\nAssuming your girlfriend knew her mom was listening in she is an asshole. Her mother is an asshole unless there is some very good reasons that your girlfriend needs much closer supervision that the average 17 year old girl, for example recent self harm.\n\nAs for my advice, I think you ought to at least give your girlfriend a chance to explain.  Find out did she know about the spying, and if she did, why didnt she warn you, and why does her mom spy.  Tell her how it made you feel. If you want to continue the relationship, you need to address these issues so you can make an informed decision. \n\nGood luck.

For 7 months, I would try to get one conversation in person, with just your girlfriend. Find out if she's been \"going along\" out of fear.

It\u2019s not fair to OP though, and I\u2019m glad he found out. It indicates moral weakness that the GF couldn\u2019t tell him the terms he was unknowing submitting to outright, and it sounds like her family will be hugely problematic in her life.\n\nOP is well within their rights to hang up, and break up, I\u2019d probably recommend it tbh - but the girl\u2019s life sounds difficult enough - we don\u2019t need to heap judgment or derision for things she\u2019s not guilty of.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

I suggest to discuss this with your therapist before talking to your GF. I would also look up terms such as Gaslighting, enmeshment, and DARVO. Do not ignore all of the red flags. It is easier to get out of this relationship now, than later.", "I am sorry this happened to you. One of the foundations of a relationship is trust.

And then for both of them to try and shift blame onto you, i'm sorry mate but it's time to pull the plug. She is too wrapped up in her moms bullshit to have a steady and happy relationship with, and you need to focus on your best interests at this point. I usually don't like advising breaking up as a first solution because reddit is too trigger happy with that advice, but i genuinely don't see another alternative here that protects your best interests, and you're still very young and it's a very new relationship (i get at your age 7 months might feel like a long term relationship, but it's a drop in the bucket in the scale of a true long term relationship) so you haven't invested too much to be lost yet, you've still got tons of time ahead of you to find a good partner who values you.
