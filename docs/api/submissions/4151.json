The ex wife having it might feel weird. I think the heirloom part makes it pretty special though. \n\nI don't think either of you are wrong. It's just a weird position to be in.", "I don't blame you at all for feeling weird. However, he's sort of in a weird spot himself.  It is a family diamond.  What the hell else is he going to do with it?", "NAH. It's understandable that you'd be uncomfortable with it because you associate it with his ex wife, but he doesn't. You're not being unreasonable so that wasn't cool of him, but to him that diamond means family and he wants you to own something incredibly important to him. There really isn't a right or wrong here.", "To clarify - is it the same ring/setting? \n \nIf not,have the diamond set into a ring that fully reflects your style.  Also you could have the ring blessed by your clergy before you wear it.", "NAH. By your wording I assume he\u2019s reusing the same diamond, but in a different ring for you. The diamond is special because it\u2019s a family heirloom, he just wants to keep it in the family. I don\u2019t see an issue with that personally. \n\nBut if you really don\u2019t want that same diamond that\u2019s your choice I guess. Just don\u2019t expect him to be able to replace it with something of equal value.", "NAH. I totally understand your discomfort with wearing the heirloom for your own engagement ring.  I don't think he's doing anything intentionally to upset you, either.  It is likely the stone, itself, that is the treasure your fiance wishes for you to have.  \n\nI'd suggest sitting with him and explain it just feels odd to wear a stone that was part of someone else's engagement ring, and you'd feel better having one that you're the first to wear.  Maybe suggest having the stone set into a nice pendant or other special piece of jewelry that you can still enjoy wearing when you go out together?", "NAH This is a tricky one. I would be much more understanding if he were trying to reuse the same ring he purchased, but this is so different from that cliche because it's not a ring he purchased for someone else. And not only is he only using the same diamond and getting you a different ring, that specific diamond is a family heirloom and very sentimental to him. But while I don't agree with your decision, I'm not comfortable calling you an asshole over it. \n\nI would try to find some sort of compromise. Would you possibly be willing to have it made into something like a necklace that you can wear for special occasions to keep it as a family heirloom?", "INFO: please and thanks. Is it the ring in its entirety or the diamond in a new setting, that is being offered?", "NAH\n\nI think it would definitely feel real, but put in a different ring would make it really easy to make it your own. But I also understand your fianc\u00e9 wanting to use the diamond anyway.", "NAH.\n\nI understand you want something uniquely yours, and that the last thing you want is to think of his Ex when looking at your ring.\n\nI would offer the center stone is the least important part of a ring. Sit down with him and a designer and pick out the rest together.\n\nIf you can't compromise on this, I'd recommend a Moissanite. Moissanite's have a higher refractive index with a more brilliant shine, and are nearly identical in hardness, but they're less than a tenth of the cost. You could easily afford a rock as big as you like, any cut, style, color. The diamond trade is an immoral monopoly that largely depends on exploited labor, hardly romantic.", "Question, would you expect an engagement ring with another diamond? Cause those things are stupidity overpriced.", "If it\u2019s a new ring with the same diamond then it wouldn\u2019t bother me but that\u2019s just me so neither of you are TA", "INFO: i would say whether you are the ahole depends on what you expect instead of that ring. If you expect a different diamond ring they Y A T. If you would be happy with any other ring that's unique for you too then N A H. \n\nI don't think your husband would de the ahole in any scenario, the ring has sentimental value and he is trying to share that even if it has a bit too much baggage for your taste.", "YTA.\n\nThis is a family heirloom and he's apparently putting it in an entirely different setting. Unless he's wallowing in money and literally cares nothing about family heirlooms, you need to get with the program. IDK why you would even feel \"odd\" about this.", "You could use a new diamond for your engagement ring and reuse the family gem in a few years down the road in a necklace or something!", "YTA. It's not \"her\" diamond, it's the family diamond. If it was the same ring I could understand. But this will be custom made to your own ring. Rejecting it is a rejection of his family. Especially since it was his mothers.", "NTA. He was not out of line offering it, but he was out of line not respecting how you feel about it.", "YTA\n\nHe's not asking you to wear her ring, he's honoring you by providing a family heirloom gem for you to have.", "NTA. Nah, I wouldn't want that either. \n\nI am left wondering how he was able to get the diamond back. If they were engaged and never married, sure, but they were married. Maybe it was in the prenuptial agreement? Maybe she just didn't want it.", "NTA, but with heirlooms it\u2019s better to think of yourself as custodian, not owner. His ex held the diamond while she was married to him, but the diamond was his family heirloom, which is why it stayed with him (not her) after they split. You now would possess the diamond, but certainly with the expectation that it continues to stay within his family.", "YTA. Its just the diamond not the ring. The diamond is an heirloom which means it wasn't bought specifically for the ex. Using your thinking its probably been worn by a few family members. Help design a ring that's perfect for you using the diamond and whatever other gemstones you choose.", "YTA, who cares.   It's a family heirloom. If you don't want to accept what he offers,  tell him your answer is \"no\".  Problem solved...you won't have to worry about the ring!!!!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There are a lot of superstitions about rings from failed weddings. But I would accept it as long as it's a new setting. That diamond was meant for you, not her! So just think about it being freed to go home.", "What if the diamond was made into a necklace or something? I understand the weird feeling but maybe you would be more comfortable with your own ring and still be able to keep the heirloom diamond as something you can wear?", "Info: it sounds like he wants to re-set it, so you're not getting the same ring. Any chance you could compromise and get it set into a pendant? Then the diamond heirloom is still used, but it's in a totally different form than the ex wife, so hopefully doesn't feel as weird?", "NAH. Personally, I'd suggest you remove the stone from the old setting and save it for a child of yours to make something else out of. They likely won't care as much, seeing as they'll just know it as \"the family heirloom\" and not \"my husband's ex's ring.\"", "Totally understandable. \n\nI would recommend saying this is new for both of us and I want to start fresh. While I'm so appreciative that you want me to have this, I don't want our marriage to start with your past or have any connection to your wife while we start our new chapter. \n\nMaybe in the future we can talk about having the diamond made into a new ring but now less concentrate on starting fresh. \n\nI think guys see a ring and don't see the emontial attachment to it or maybe he does but for him it's that it belong to his grandma and doesn't even think about his Ex-wife. \n\nUnless, he being cheap about it I just don't think he gets it and to be sensitive because about creating a new plan for you guys. Even if the ring is smaller or not as nice.", "turn it into a pendant", "NTA- not as your engagement ring? Ask for it to be remounted in a necklace?", "I have relative that owns a pawn shop.  It's common for people to buy jewelry at a pawn shop for a second marriage after taking a bath on a ring in the first marriage.\n\nSo my uncle overhears a couple talking about rings (mostly looking at the stone as you'd obviously reset the stone to a new ring) and the woman says '*I just don't know, I just sort of feel like I want a new diamond not a used diamond'* then looking at my uncle *'You know what I mean?'*\n\nAnd my uncle says *'I don't know, unless you mean a man made diamond all the diamonds in the world are a million years old, there's not such thing as a new natural diamond'.*\n\nYou are probably talking about a stone that is much, much nicer than anything your fianc\u00e9 will be able to afford and the ring setting will be unique to you.  It's not the same ring as your ex's fiance.  That diamond is just as old as the smaller diamonds you'd be buying off the market.", "YTA\n\nits a family heirloom... you are part of the family.\n\ncant you appreciate that? man.", "I get it, too. Having been in the jewelry industry for 30 years, I've seen some odd/uncomfortable situations. I'd say, the diamond is just a rock. Get it reset into something of her choosing, but that doesn't sound like it would be amenable for her. If he can afford to buy a new ring of her choice, he should. Return the diamond to whomever it should go to. Problem solved.", ">What the hell else is he going to do with it?\n\nHe could sell it and get 1/50 of it's appraised value ;)", "Best answer yet. Thank you.", "OP said the same diamond in her ring. It seems pretty clear it\u2019ll be the diamond but in a different ring for OP.", "Or sage the diamond ;D", "You said it...you, personally, wouldn't have a problem. But everyone's different. I probably wouldn't care myself, as long as i could reset it, or use the original setting. But she has a right to feel \"icky\" about it.", "Oh! How perfect! I hadn't thought of that. Was only thinking reset in a new ring setting, or whole new ring. You hit the [albeit expensive] sweet spot. Kudos.", "This is what I was going to ask", "Yeah, they're ridiculously expensive. But having said that, yes, another ring if she's that uncomfortable, and won't be comfortable with a reset. Lots of options besides a jewelry store.", "I did exactly that - got heirloom diamond back from ex, put it in new ring for new wife. She appreciated that I was willing to get an heirloom back for her. I would have been fine if she didn't want it for the same reason as the OP. The husband wasn't wrong to offer it, but he was wrong not to respect the OP's thoughts on it. Ironically - in my case - neither me, nor my wife GAF about diamonds. (as I said, she appreciated that I was willing to get an heirloom for her - it didn't matter what it was)", "It depends on how their relationship went.\n\nMy ex and I are still friends and there were no hard feelings when we divorced.\n\nThe diamond being an heirloom likely made a difference. It's possible that he had a new stone put into the ring for her.\n\nI'm not sentimental about jewelry, myself, so when my first husband proposed with the engagement ring he'd originally bought for a previous fianc\u00e9, it didn't much matter to me. The ring was just a symbol and it looked nice, and that was good enough for me.", "If that much!", "Yeah, but a lot of people believe stones carry energy, good and bad. Not saying that's the case here. Maybe she just thinks it's bad luck, now that it's been in a bad marriage?", "This is the way tbh.", "Yep that\u2019s why I voted NAH not Y T A haha. She\u2019s entitled to feel the way she does but that doesn\u2019t make him T A.", "Based on the verbiage, my impression was that it's only the diamond and he plans to have it put into a new custom setting.", "Thank you for your comment. Well, that's the point: you'd be fine with another ring if she was uncomfortable. You are understanding and flexible. Most people here are missing the big picture.", "Thats good of you. \n\nOP is being entitled."]}
