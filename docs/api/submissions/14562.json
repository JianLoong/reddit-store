John is black and I am mixed (Native American and Black). John has two daughters, 21yo \"Jackie\" and 25yo \"Nena\". I took after my dad fully and I have very strong Native American features, outside of my hair. This is what started the problems, I guess. Johns daughters knew of me but only knew my name and about us living together in \"our home\". They hadn't seen their father in years because they live out of state. But their dad wanted them to meet me and planned for 2 months to get them out here, which included me paying for most of their air fare (I make substantially more than John). They were going to stay here with us, as my home is 4 bedrooms. \n\nI had to work when they got in so their dad picked them up and I was due home a few hours later. I walk in to my home and at first the girls were nice and shook my hand and whatever but as soon as I took my hat off and they saw my braids, all hell broke loose with Jackie. She said something like \"oh hell no, you did not just walk in to my daddies home for the first time meeting us and already insulting us with your cultural appropriation bullshit\". I was definitely quite taken aback but I didn't really know how to respond either. So I just stood there staring. John was in the back BBQing and didn't hear this. So she like looks at me and goes \"do you have anything to say for yourself? Like what is this shit?\" And flips my braid. At this point Nena is just standing back with her arms crossed and eyebrows raised, glaring at me as well so I felt extremely cornered. \n\nI just walk past them to go to John because I didn't know what to do and they follow me and start going off on John about me \"disrespecting their heritage\". John didn't even correct them or anything. He just looked at my hair and shrugged saying he thought it was nice. I was flabbergasted. I said something like \"I'm mixed, part black and part Native American. Both cultures have braids. And this is my fucking house and now you both can leave.\" Nena started protesting and saying \"why didn't you just say that, like use your words\" but Jackie was calling me a liar. John was saying that we all needed to calm down. So I said again to get the fuck out. They did eventually after losing their shit about them supposed to have stayed here and having no money for a hotel. John is saying I ruined his chance at reconnecting with his daughters and I made him leave too. AITA? I'm so fucking lost right now.", "created_utc": 1681249974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12iz2on/aita_for_kicking_out_my_bfs_daughters_who_i_just/", "score": 607, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who comes to someones home and verbally attacks them after making a snap judgement?  OP this man is not to blame for his daughters actions but I'd seriously reconsider a relationship with him. You had to pay for his daughters airfare and made the effort on his behalf. That alone would give me pause but then to not have your back when they insulted you in your own home, then being blamed for coming between them. Where is his worth as a partner?", "NTA \n\nKick John to the curb completely.  If he wants to be with you, that means standing up for you even to his daughters.  What his daughters did is basically racism; they judge you (harshly) based solely on what they perceived your race to be.  Not to mention that they did this to you in your own home.  John should have been straight with his daughters that this was YOUR home, not his or even one that you two got together.", "OP you are amazing! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f Definitely NTA.\n\nLook at you, not just owning your house & having a great job like a true boss but also not accepting any disrespect from those brats or that spineless man. \n\nYou sound like you know your worth. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Nta\n\nAnd you better kick him out too before he has squatting rights.", "NTA", "NTA: Guests came into your house and started insulting you (instead of asking a basic question). Your BF can go be a father and teach his daughters some basic manners, but no, he decides to blame you for ruining his relationship with them?

So sorry that this happened to you.", "NTA at all. My heart goes out to you. You were ambushed in your own home. You are being used by John however,  you footed most off the bill\nfor his daughters to visit.  John gave the impression it was his house to his daughters. He didn't make a firm stand for you when one of his daughters was being very disrespectful to you. John is now trying to guilt you having  his daughters back in your house back  by telling you that he can't reconnect with his daughters. John is using you.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nDump this loser now", "NTA and they can figure their lives out while you change the locks. Hellll naw\n\nI'd expect a massive and humble apology or else I wouldn't let them back in.", "NTA, I appreciate that cultural appropriation is a triggering thing BUT they sure jumped to conclusions and steamrolled you. And then when you told them what\u2019s up they doubled down and tried to bully you about not saying something right away. \u201cUse your words\u201d, how extremely condescending of them. Wow. \n\nI\u2019d also be mad af at John for not telling the girls to calm down and standing up for you. \u201cUse your words\u201d John.

You did try to open up a line of communication with your (ex?) bf to have him handle the situation. You did try to ignore the daughter poisonous welcome. Only after it was revealed to be 3 against 1 did you use your protective words.\n\nFar too often women bend over themselves into contorted pretzels as the soother in these situations, when instead the other 3 had every opportunity to behave like halfway decent people.\n\nThe girls had 2 opportunities to stop acting the fool. BF had 1 full opportunity to remember his role.\n\nEveryone let you down, so you relied on yourself.\n\nI see zero problem with your actions.\n\nWell done.", "NTA, both your cultures have braids in their culture. You did not have to justify the fact you are mixed race, either, because as you rightly pointed out, braids were worn by First Nations as well - not just two long braids, but a whole range of fabulous hairstyles depending on the Nation. I actually have a photo of a Cree chief, taken in 1885, sporting dreadlocks. He sure as hell wasn't appropriating anything.\n\nWhile I understand how braids are a controversial issue and there needs to be a real discussion about how hair type is used to discriminate, your boyfriend's daughter should have paused to check her own privilege on this one as she is obviously ignorant of Indigenous cultures.", "NTA\n\nThis is a preview of how 'John' will not have your back for situations going forward... he ain't the one.", "NTA, that's just toxic behavior. Also lots of red flags in this relationship, with \"John\" the deadbeat standing by while his moocher daughters abused you. The only way you'd be the AH is if you let any of them anywhere near you again.", "Nta.  Cultural appropriation for braids is thrown around a lot; braids are actually very common in a lot of cultures.

Better.\n\nLike damn, I hope you\u2019re single now. \nYou sound amazing.\n\nNTA", "Wait, so bro was trying to patch up and catch up with his daughters on your dime? And letting them mouth off on you on the first meeting?\n\nAre you sure he's with you for the right reasons? does he have your back? \n\nHe's grown. it's not YOUR job to make it easier for him to meet his kids and connect with them.", "NTA! Sounds like they came with a chip already on their shoulders. Braids are not exclusively a Black hairstyle. They didn't even originate with Black people. That made absolutely NO sense. You were well within your rights to tell them to leave and I, for one, am glad you stood up for yourself, even if your so-called boyfriend wouldn't.

The fact that these two idiots have no damn clue that it's YOUR house, not their deadbeat fathers is enough to indicate exactly who he is.  He let these loudmouth brats completely disrespect you and didn't say a word.  Then he has the nerve to blame you!  I would have sent him to the same hotel his brainless children.", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA. You said exactly what needed to be said. Bonus is you get to know that John is a jerk as well. You shouldn\u2019t be feeling lost because you were so strong to stand up for yourself.", "NTA And those girls are also ignorant.  Braided, beaded, corn rows, etc have been in many cultures for thousands of years. So even totally white folks can have braided hair.

John is black and I am mixed (Native American and Black). John has two daughters, 21yo \"Jackie\" and 25yo \"Nena\". I took after my dad fully and I have very strong Native American features, outside of my hair. This is what started the problems, I guess. Johns daughters knew of me but only knew my name and about us living together in \"our home\". They hadn't seen their father in years because they live out of state. But their dad wanted them to meet me and planned for 2 months to get them out here, which included me paying for most of their air fare (I make substantially more than John). They were going to stay here with us, as my home is 4 bedrooms. \n\nI had to work when they got in so their dad picked them up and I was due home a few hours later. I walk in to my home and at first the girls were nice and shook my hand and whatever but as soon as I took my hat off and they saw my braids, all hell broke loose with Jackie. She said something like \"oh hell no, you did not just walk in to my daddies home for the first time meeting us and already insulting us with your cultural appropriation bullshit\". I was definitely quite taken aback but I didn't really know how to respond either. So I just stood there staring. John was in the back BBQing and didn't hear this. So she like looks at me and goes \"do you have anything to say for yourself? Like what is this shit?\" And flips my braid. At this point Nena is just standing back with her arms crossed and eyebrows raised, glaring at me as well so I felt extremely cornered. \n\nI just walk past them to go to John because I didn't know what to do and they follow me and start going off on John about me \"disrespecting their heritage\". John didn't even correct them or anything. He just looked at my hair and shrugged saying he thought it was nice. I was flabbergasted. I said something like \"I'm mixed, part black and part Native American. Both cultures have braids. And this is my fucking house and now you both can leave.\" Nena started protesting and saying \"why didn't you just say that, like use your words\" but Jackie was calling me a liar. John was saying that we all needed to calm down. So I said again to get the fuck out. They did eventually after losing their shit about them supposed to have stayed here and having no money for a hotel. John is saying I ruined his chance at reconnecting with his daughters and I made him leave too. AITA? I'm so fucking lost right now.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I was visiting someone I hadn't seen in a long time (father in this case,), I'd be out chatting while they were bbqing, not hanging out inside with someone I had regular contact with (sister.)", "Thank you for educating me", "Well different people have different takes on these situations. That's the point of this sub. I'm was a step-mum to some difficult adult step daughters myself, and I know there were times I've wished that I'd taken some time to calm down before I responded to them,  because it would have allowed me to be less of an AH. That's why I suggested that as a better option. \n\nMy username was just the first randomly generated one that reddit suggested so I have literally no idea what you mean about that?", "Giant vats of marinara flags", "I think they were planing to take over their daddy's home LOL", "And dreads too!!!!", "Even if OP was as white as the driven snow, she can wear damn braids. Venus of Willendorf is the oldest depiction of braids and it is 30K years old from Austria.", "And Hispanic women with their long braids!", "They didn't know she was NA. Their concern over appropriation is fair, but their way of addressing it was beyond ridiculous. Which I think we can agree on. Also I associate gatekeeping with like unnecessary things such as liking certain bands or not telling someone about a taco spot, stupid shit like that, so maybe that's just me.", "Ha! Excellent.", "Yeah nah I\u2019ma stop you right here. We were taken from our home country. We had no choice but to assimilate. It\u2019s literally legal for most states to discriminate against our hair texture. It was ILLEGAL for us to wear our natural hair, so we wore scarves. Then scarves were inappropriate, so we had to adopt white culture to assimilate. Everyone in this thread wants to talk about history and come correct, until it\u2019s Black Americans history. No, I\u2019m not saying what they did was right. I think this whole thing is stupid. But take a second to actually learn about BLACK history and not just what you know Pearson/McGraw-Hill textbooks, but actual people who experienced this oppression who are still living today. Ruby Bridges has an instagram. The first black girl to go to an all white school. Let\u2019s think a little bit before just talking.", "People are saying that about hoops?? I've always worn hoops. I never knew that could be considered cultural..", "Over 40 years ago the girls in my class braided the front of my fine, straight, slippery white girl hair on a class trip to Six Flags so I could enjoy the rides without my hair being a problem.  They were awesome.", "yea no, braids definitely CAN be cultural appropriation. europeans weren\u2019t walking around in boxbraids and cornrows. some braiding techniques were literally invented as maps for SLAVES to escape plantations. people are still discriminated against in social setting and work environments for having locs. let\u2019s not.", "I always thought there was a difference between cultural appreciation (wow I love your hair, jewelers, etc can I try it?) and cultural appropriation (white guy whose ancestors are all British opens an \u201cauthentic\u201d Mexican restaurant and profits off other people\u2019s culture). Looks like the definition has changed since I learned about it.", ">Peasants all over Europe had braids\n\nNot just peasants. Noble ladies wore braids too", "But it's not everyone's fault that poc get discriminated for  a hairstyle and not white people, that's from years of systematic racism, and it's stupid, people should be able to wear their hair however they want as long as it's safe (certain jobs might require hair coverings for safety concerns like when working with machinery, food, or performing surgery). People really out here tryna tell people what to do with their body just cause other groups did it first.  What a sad species we are xD.", "word", "100% something to that effect was said.", "How is their concern about cultural appropriation fair if white, brown, and black cultures all have braids?", "It\u2019s not fair. Many cultures have braids.", "No, their concern over appropriation was not fair. They have zero right to walk into somebody's home and instantly start shit over hair braids of all things. These are deeply ignorant and trashy people with no manners.", "Native Americans didn't invent braiding hair. They would have been many thousands of years too late to do so.", "They didn\u2019t need to know she was NA or black or anything else. Since braids are traditional to Hispanic, white, NA, black etc.. there is NO concern about appropriation, so no cause to mention anything about braids.", "Yet a circle is a basic shape...", "A lot of \"cultural appropriation\" accusations are tossed out by people who haven't seen much past their own experience. Where they grew up only people of a certain race or class wore that kind of jewelry, had that kind of haircut, wore that kind of clothing. In their mind it only exists within those narrow parameters. \n\nBack in the 90s I got a leather motorcycle jacket. My dad thought it was kinda funny because when he was growing up, only \"hoods\" (think West Side Story) wore jackets like that. By the 90s they were just jackets.", "As an Irish guy hoop earring as \"traditionally\" traveller but also inner city women who also want to look like Oompa Loompas.", "Same, only it was in high school backstage at musical practice, and my friends told me to sleep with a sock hat on that night so I could wear it like that at school the next day. It was awesome.", "Viking warriors usually wore long braids or dreadlocks to make them more intimidating to their enemies in battle \u2013 or perhaps, more simply, for the practical purpose or keeping their hair out of their eyes while fighting!", "boxbraids and cornrows are worn because they're protective hairstyles for textured hair. yeah, white people are less likely to have hair that needs that. but then is it cultural appropriation when black girls wear fine-textured wigs? \n\nlike, let's be proud of our cultures and let's be respectful to others- but it's a hairstyle.", "Hair has special spiritual and cultural significance for tribes, though traditions and styles vary from tribe to tribe. Whether worn long, braided or bound in a knot, most North American indigenous peoples see hair as a source of strength and power.", "I just recently learned this about the maps and it is cool as hell", "My 5th grade teacher in white suburbs told us that when a girl came back from a tropical cruise with cornrows. I thought it was such a neat fact and said we shouldnt wear a style we didnt understand, although I didn't learn the phrase cultural appropriation until I was much older!", "You either skimmed my comment or didn't read it at all. Try again. Nowhere did I say it was everyone's fault. And yes there are jobs that require your hair to be covered- but that wasn't what was being discussed. Stop being facetious- you knew exactly what I meant.\n\nWhenever poc talk about bigotry there's always that person who brings up unrelated topics and puts words in people's mouths to try to invalidate the feelings and experiences of minorities. Congrats on being that person.", "We used to be proud to be a \"melting pot\".  EVERYONE enjoying the best of EVERY peoples.", "That's just classist stereotyping, lots of girls I know wear hoop earrings, including me, and I'm roughly the colour of a bottle of milk. Hoop earrings are a classic, they've never been exclusive to any particular group.", "Ran this past my \u201csettled traveller\u201d GF and, after laughing for a minute straight, she invented an Oompa Loompa verse succinctly stating her feelings on this subject that I can\u2019t share in polite company.", "What is with that orange skin coloring?", "I've wondered about this before. Either it's ok both ways or in no ways.", "I\u2019ve been on a cruise to the Bahamas where locals were braiding the hair of tourists. They didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with the appropriation when they were taking the tourist\u2019s money. Funny that it was suddenly an issue when she returned to the States.", "The power differential changes things. There are school and work dress codes that try to ban traditional and protective black hairstyles, for example, so their adoption by white people as mere \u201cstyle\u201d can be galling. But even if all they saw of OP was her more indigenous features, she\u2019s definitely not on a \u201cmore powerful, exploitative\u201d side of the racial power differential."]}
