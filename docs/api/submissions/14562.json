John is black and I am mixed (Native American and Black). John has two daughters, 21yo \"Jackie\" and 25yo \"Nena\". I took after my dad fully and I have very strong Native American features, outside of my hair. This is what started the problems, I guess. Johns daughters knew of me but only knew my name and about us living together in \"our home\". They hadn't seen their father in years because they live out of state. But their dad wanted them to meet me and planned for 2 months to get them out here, which included me paying for most of their air fare (I make substantially more than John). They were going to stay here with us, as my home is 4 bedrooms. \n\nI had to work when they got in so their dad picked them up and I was due home a few hours later. I walk in to my home and at first the girls were nice and shook my hand and whatever but as soon as I took my hat off and they saw my braids, all hell broke loose with Jackie. She said something like \"oh hell no, you did not just walk in to my daddies home for the first time meeting us and already insulting us with your cultural appropriation bullshit\". I was definitely quite taken aback but I didn't really know how to respond either. So I just stood there staring. John was in the back BBQing and didn't hear this. So she like looks at me and goes \"do you have anything to say for yourself? Like what is this shit?\" And flips my braid. At this point Nena is just standing back with her arms crossed and eyebrows raised, glaring at me as well so I felt extremely cornered. \n\nI just walk past them to go to John because I didn't know what to do and they follow me and start going off on John about me \"disrespecting their heritage\". John didn't even correct them or anything. He just looked at my hair and shrugged saying he thought it was nice. I was flabbergasted. I said something like \"I'm mixed, part black and part Native American. Both cultures have braids. And this is my fucking house and now you both can leave.\" Nena started protesting and saying \"why didn't you just say that, like use your words\" but Jackie was calling me a liar. John was saying that we all needed to calm down. So I said again to get the fuck out. They did eventually after losing their shit about them supposed to have stayed here and having no money for a hotel. John is saying I ruined his chance at reconnecting with his daughters and I made him leave too. AITA? I'm so fucking lost right now.", "created_utc": 1681249974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12iz2on/aita_for_kicking_out_my_bfs_daughters_who_i_just/", "score": 3610, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Failure to be supportive is a deal breaker.", "NTA, break up with the BF.", "NTA but that man is a bum who is taking advantage of you. Nobody has the right to speak to you like that, especially in your own home, and John's response was absolutely pathetic. Does he have redeeming qualities that make up for his lack of a spine?", "They're racist, and he's stupid - you don't need either in your life.", "NTA Break up with leech boyfriend. He didn't even defend you.", "NTA - entitled brats got what was coming to them and he should\u2019ve stood up for you", "NTA, don\u2019t ever let people who disrespect you stay in your house.  It\u2019s like letting in poison.  The people you have in your home make a huge impact. Your home is your sanctuary, protect it.", "NTA be grateful you got rid of everyone so easily! You have dodged 3 bullets lol", "Wow. No. You're absolutely NTA.\n\nJohn, on the other hand,  is", "NTA. He's free to head out with them. What does John add to your life? Seriously?

But it might be best to break up with John.  First of all, he didn't defend you. Second of all, I can't see you reconciling with them. I also don't think he'll distance himself from them or demand they apologize, so that's going to make a very  tense relationship.", "You're not lost, you just found yourself.

Don't look back.", "NTA \n\nLots of cultures braid their hair, it\u2019s not a strictly black thing.", "NTA. Even if your heritage wasn't what it is, they don't have an exclusive claim on braids.

John can come back to pick up his belongings, but he needs to go.", "NTA - That's awesome that you kicked them *and* him out.", "NTA\n\nPeople who behave like that should never be welcome in your home.\n\nHe raised two racist snowflakes and doesn\u2018t defend you when the kids are clearly in the wrong. Even calling you a liar when being called out for their mistake. \n\nAnd he seemingly made them believe that it was his house. \n\nKick him out as well.", "Definitely NTA.  Who comes to someones home and verbally attacks them after making a snap judgement?  OP this man is not to blame for his daughters actions but I'd seriously reconsider a relationship with him. You had to pay for his daughters airfare and made the effort on his behalf. That alone would give me pause but then to not have your back when they insulted you in your own home, then being blamed for coming between them. Where is his worth as a partner?", "NTA \n\nKick John to the curb completely.  If he wants to be with you, that means standing up for you even to his daughters.  What his daughters did is basically racism; they judge you (harshly) based solely on what they perceived your race to be.  Not to mention that they did this to you in your own home.  John should have been straight with his daughters that this was YOUR home, not his or even one that you two got together.", "OP you are amazing! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f Definitely NTA.\n\nLook at you, not just owning your house & having a great job like a true boss but also not accepting any disrespect from those brats or that spineless man. \n\nYou sound like you know your worth. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Nta\n\nAnd you better kick him out too before he has squatting rights.", "NTA", "NTA: Guests came into your house and started insulting you (instead of asking a basic question). Your BF can go be a father and teach his daughters some basic manners, but no, he decides to blame you for ruining his relationship with them? There are some definite AH's in this story and all three owe you an apology.", "NTA.  What horrible people - you will be better off without any of them.  So sorry that this happened to you.", "NTA at all. My heart goes out to you. You were ambushed in your own home. You are being used by John however,  you footed most off the bill\nfor his daughters to visit.  John gave the impression it was his house to his daughters. He didn't make a firm stand for you when one of his daughters was being very disrespectful to you. John is now trying to guilt you having  his daughters back in your house back  by telling you that he can't reconnect with his daughters. John is using you.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nDump this loser now", "NTA and they can figure their lives out while you change the locks. Hellll naw\n\nI'd expect a massive and humble apology or else I wouldn't let them back in.", "NTA, I appreciate that cultural appropriation is a triggering thing BUT they sure jumped to conclusions and steamrolled you. And then when you told them what\u2019s up they doubled down and tried to bully you about not saying something right away. \u201cUse your words\u201d, how extremely condescending of them. Wow. \n\nI\u2019d also be mad af at John for not telling the girls to calm down and standing up for you. \u201cUse your words\u201d John. Honestly you\u2019re the only non-ah in this story!", "Why is the father not also kicked out. That man is using you OP.

You did try to open up a line of communication with your (ex?) bf to have him handle the situation. You did try to ignore the daughters poisonous welcome. Only after it was revealed to be 3 against 1 did you use your protective words.\n\nFar too often women bend over themselves into contorted pretzels as the soother in these situations, when instead the other 3 had every opportunity to behave like halfway decent people.\n\nThe girls had 2 opportunities to stop acting the fool. BF had 1 full opportunity to remember his role.\n\nEveryone let you down, so you relied on yourself.\n\nI see zero problem with your actions.\n\nWell done.", "NTA, both your cultures have braids in their culture. You did not have to justify the fact you are mixed race, either, because as you rightly pointed out, braids were worn by First Nations as well - not just two long braids, but a whole range of fabulous hairstyles depending on the Nation. I actually have a photo of a Cree chief, taken in 1885, sporting dreadlocks. He sure as hell wasn't appropriating anything.\n\nWhile I understand how braids are a controversial issue and there needs to be a real discussion about how hair type is used to discriminate, your boyfriend's daughter should have paused to check her own privilege on this one as she is obviously ignorant of Indigenous cultures.", "NTA\n\nThis is a preview of how 'John' will not have your back for situations going forward... he ain't the one.", "NTA, that's just toxic behavior. Also lots of red flags in this relationship, with \"John\" the deadbeat standing by while his moocher daughters abused you. The only way you'd be the AH is if you let any of them anywhere near you again.", "Nta.  Cultural appropriation for braids is thrown around a lot; braids are actually very common in a lot of cultures.  The daughters came off rude and disrespectful, instead of having an actual conversation with you.  Then, she tries to gaslight you with \"use your words.\"  Honestly, I would also rethink your relationship if your bf is not willing to reasonably come to your side when appropriate.", "NTA and get rid of them all.

Better.\n\nLike damn, I hope you\u2019re single now. \nYou sound amazing.\n\nNTA", "Wait, so bro was trying to patch up and catch up with his daughters on your dime? And letting them mouth off on you on the first meeting?\n\nAre you sure he's with you for the right reasons? does he have your back? \n\nHe's grown. it's not YOUR job to make it easier for him to meet his kids and connect with them.", "NTA! Sounds like they came with a chip already on their shoulders. Braids are not exclusively a Black hairstyle. They didn't even originate with Black people. That made absolutely NO sense. You were well within your rights to tell them to leave and I, for one, am glad you stood up for yourself, even if your so-called boyfriend wouldn't.

The fact that these two idiots have no damn clue that it's YOUR house, not their deadbeat fathers is enough to indicate exactly who he is.  He let these loudmouth brats completely disrespect you and didn't say a word.  Then he has the nerve to blame you!  I would have sent him to the same hotel his brainless children.", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA. You said exactly what needed to be said. Bonus is you get to know that John is a jerk as well. You shouldn\u2019t be feeling lost because you were so strong to stand up for yourself.", "NTA And those girls are also ignorant.  Braided, beaded, corn rows, etc have been in many cultures for thousands of years. So even totally white folks can have braided hair.

The girls sound like they weren't going to approve of this OP for personal reasons and the hair was an easy point to target. That does not erase the actual harm appropriation causes.

Better yet take yourself off for a walk, calm down then come back and tell them they owe you an apology.

John is black and I am mixed (Native American and Black). John has two daughters, 21yo \"Jackie\" and 25yo \"Nena\". I took after my dad fully and I have very strong Native American features, outside of my hair. This is what started the problems, I guess. Johns daughters knew of me but only knew my name and about us living together in \"our home\". They hadn't seen their father in years because they live out of state. But their dad wanted them to meet me and planned for 2 months to get them out here, which included me paying for most of their air fare (I make substantially more than John). They were going to stay here with us, as my home is 4 bedrooms. \n\nI had to work when they got in so their dad picked them up and I was due home a few hours later. I walk in to my home and at first the girls were nice and shook my hand and whatever but as soon as I took my hat off and they saw my braids, all hell broke loose with Jackie. She said something like \"oh hell no, you did not just walk in to my daddies home for the first time meeting us and already insulting us with your cultural appropriation bullshit\". I was definitely quite taken aback but I didn't really know how to respond either. So I just stood there staring. John was in the back BBQing and didn't hear this. So she like looks at me and goes \"do you have anything to say for yourself? Like what is this shit?\" And flips my braid. At this point Nena is just standing back with her arms crossed and eyebrows raised, glaring at me as well so I felt extremely cornered. \n\nI just walk past them to go to John because I didn't know what to do and they follow me and start going off on John about me \"disrespecting their heritage\". John didn't even correct them or anything. He just looked at my hair and shrugged saying he thought it was nice. I was flabbergasted. I said something like \"I'm mixed, part black and part Native American. Both cultures have braids. And this is my fucking house and now you both can leave.\" Nena started protesting and saying \"why didn't you just say that, like use your words\" but Jackie was calling me a liar. John was saying that we all needed to calm down. So I said again to get the fuck out. They did eventually after losing their shit about them supposed to have stayed here and having no money for a hotel. John is saying I ruined his chance at reconnecting with his daughters and I made him leave too. AITA? I'm so fucking lost right now.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
