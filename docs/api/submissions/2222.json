They loved me unconditionally compared to my bio parents but as soon as my younger sister (F28)-(their bio daughter) came into the picture they started leaning towards favoring her. They still treat me well, don't get me wrong! But they have \"their moments\" especially on holidays.\n\n\nFor thanksgiving, my parents wanted someone in the family to host thanksgiving dinner because they were dealing with health problems and can not commit. I volunteered and said that I'll glady host dinner on thanksgiving but mom replied and said that my sister will do it. I asked why and after pressuring her she said that she's the bio daughter, so \"technically\" she's family. I asked if I wasn't family and she and my dad said it's \"complicated\". I was livid and hurt. I decided that after this I will no longer be calling them mom and dad, yes they're nice to me but I decided to just start calling them \"mr.\" And \"mrs.\".\n\n\nSo whe they called, I referred to them as mr and mrs. When they visited I still used mr and mrs. Their reaction was to just stare in confusion but the straw was last night. We were eating dinner, and I turned to dad and said \"Mr. Clarkson...won't you pass me the salt, please\" dad looked stunned. I then said \"Mrs. Clarkson do you need help with the oven?\" She snapped and asked what the hell was that about and I told them that since they don't see me as family then why bother call them mom and dad. She and dad were furious saying it was petty and childish. My sister and her partner were laughing at this. The argument got louder and I had go leave. I said \"Goodbye mr. And mrs. Clarkson\" on the way out which made dad snap.\n\n\nHe and mom kept calling me nonstop. My husband had no idea what was going on he asked what the deal was and when I told him he agreed that it was childish and that I could've gotten the message across in a more mature way than this disrespect I'm displaying.\n\n\nAITA? They're mad as they can be and are begging me to stop or else I'll ruin thanksgiving when I start doing it infront of other relatives.\n\n\n\nInfo -I have not done this in public. I would not do it. I only did it at their home or my home.", "created_utc": 1668358479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu77rn/aita_for_no_longer_calling_my_parents_mom_and_dad/", "score": 3871, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At this point they don't sound deserving of those titles in the slightest.\n\nPetty? Yes. But it was also a good way to show them just how unimportant they made you feel. You can say you're hurt all you want and it will fall on deaf ears because they don't seem to realize how freaking disgusting that comment was.

Sure. But how can you seriously look at someone who claimed to love you and then basically say you're not family without having any ill feelings towards them.

Well.. what they said is that their bio-child technically was family, but just try and tell me that comment didn't extend to them saying you technically weren't.\n\nAs for is it immature?  Ehh, maybe.  Is that immaturity enough to make you TA in this situation?  NOT EVEN A LITTLE.  They think it's fine for them to suggest to you that they don't technically consider you to be family but are EXTREMELY OFFENDED when you suggest right back to them the same sentiment.  Does it not occur to them that when they turned down your offer to host Thanksgiving because of this \"technically family\" BS that YOU might have likewise been extremely offended by that?\n\nNTA.

Your sister laughing about it sounds like she realizes exactly why and isn\u2019t offended on their behalf, which just proves that you\u2019re NTA. Is it a little petty? Sure. But who says some pettiness isn\u2019t deserved. I think they earned it.", "NTA. What they said to you was very hurtful\u2026 as well as legally and socially absurd. You are in every context \u201cfamily\u201d. They failed you greatly as parents in \u201cotherizing\u201d you. I think your demonstration is an apt point. The only thing is, I think you need to sit down and discuss it. Maybe even with a counsellor, if possible. They need to know how it hurt you, *and* you need to know if they are angry with the \u201cMr & Mrs\u201d because they see themselves as *your* parents or, do they just want you to be \u201cgrateful\u201d to have raised you and feel \u201cmom & dad\u201d are names like a badge they feel they earned.", "They want to be called mom and dad but they don't see you as a family.

Maybe you should have asked them, \"what do I call you now then if I'm not a real family?\" Just to knock some sense into their brain.", "NTA.\n\nThey said you weren't family bc its complicated, you made it uncomplicated for them.", "NTA, it's not complicated at all, they adopted you. They chose to be your parents and are now trying to make a distinction between you both. This is disrespectful and they can't now call you out on putting up walls when it was all their doing.", "NTA. You\u2019re not \u201ctechnically family\u201d is a weasel way of saying they saw you as a place holder child. Once the one they wanted showed up, then they could drop the pretense of \u201cfamily\u201d. You\u2019re paper family, not \u201creal\u201d family. So why treat them any different? Yeah it\u2019s petty. Sonia lying to a child for decades and then dropping the truth that they never considered you to be real family.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m adopted. It seems this is a common occurrence for people who adopt a child and then manage to have a biological one and ITS SO SHITTY.\n\nYou\u2019re much better than me. I\u2019d cut them out of my life entirely.", "NTA - they set the stage, you just followed their lead. That's on them. Don't listen to the everyone sucks responses below (I saw at least one). You're not obligated to \"be the bigger person\" when someone starts something like that.", "Would you like to come to my house for Thanksgiving? Everyone who eats at my table is family, regardless of blood. I\u2019m not old enough to be your mom but you can call me Aunt Mags.", "NTA. \nThey said you weren't family. So why would you call them mom and dad? They brought this on themselves, your child is your child regardless of genetics. I'm so sorry this happened to you OP.", "NTA. This is what they asked for. Yeah maybe it's a little petty but they deserve petty for what your mother said. I wouldn't want to call them mom or dad either and honestly would be hard pressed to attend any function of theirs.", "NTA, anyone saying y-t-a or e-s-h is insane. adopting a kid is supposed to mean taking them into your family. to blatantly show favoritism for their biological child is fucked.", "NTA.  I would very bluntly tell them that they have wounded you deeply. You \"thought\" that they were your parents in every way that matters...but THEY TOLD YOU that this was not the case and you really are not family in their hearts and minds. How are you supposed to handle that? Pretend they never said it? Pretend that they didn't lie to you your whole life?  And their only objection is that they find being called out embarrassing?!?!  Oh lordy!  Maybe you are being a little \"childish\" but they are Cruel.", "NTA - But petty AF in the best way. Understand where its coming from and also kind of hilarious. You are just giving them back their own medicin. Next step could be cancelling the holidays with them and spend til with your husbands family, as you are prioritizing spending the holidays with family.", "NTA. \"Technically\" you are correct.", "NTA \n\nFuck em! If you're not family why would you use familial terms? Quite frankly using Mr and Mrs is more respect then I'd give them", "NTA. I feel like this is probably the most respectful way to get your point across. Either you're family or you're not. If you're not family enough to host thanksgiving then they don't get to have their cake and eat it too. I don't find it petty or childish. I find it to be an equal exchange of energy to their response.", "NTA but why spend time with them?

I\u2019d literally never call them mom or dad again.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine how hurt you must be after being told you weren\u2019t real family. They are the AHs here.

I get that you\u2019re hurt and want to hurt them back but other than their ego they don\u2019t seem to get it or care. Your husband is a giant AH too.", "NTA-was it childish, maybe. Is it still funny as hell?? Yep!", "Don't go to Thanksgiving.", "NTA by any stretch. As someone who is also adopted, I would immediately go no contact if my parents ever said that to me.", "NTA \n\nThey basically said you wasn't family and that's why you couldn't host. What did they expect? You to throw yourself at their feet and beg them to let you be part of the family they adopted you into?", "NTA.\n\nIt isn't complicated at all. You're either family or you're not. They have no right to do that to you.", "NTA- they started it, you finished it. I\u2019m sorry OP. It must\u2019ve been so hurtful to hear that from your parents. Hearts make families, not blood.", "NTA. They showed their true colors. Even if you had kids, they'd probably treat your sister's kids with obvious favoritism at this point. Why even bother going to Thanksgiving? Spend time with your husband and his family or your friends elsewhere.", "I'd drop Mr. And Mrs. And just use their names tbh", "NTA - there\u2019s no complication in this. Your parents assholes and your husband sucks too. \n\nStick to your guns and keep standing up for yourself. You deserve a level of respect that your husband and \u2018parents\u2019 seem unwilling to provide", "NTA, they literally told you they don\u2019t see you as family. That is so cruel to say to your child, adopted or not.", "NTA.  They are lucky you\u2019re even speaking to them at all.", "NTA.  They wouldn't say that you are family.  I can't imagine the hurt.  I would probably call them by their first names because that is a bit more intimate.", "NTA - I believe that \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d are titles to be earned. At some point, your parents earned those titles from you and you gave them to them. However, they told you point-blank that they considered you to be less-than, that you weren\u2019t *really* family. That\u2019s honestly despicable. They relinquished the titles themselves after that. You have the right to take those titles away, especially since they basically threw them off themselves.\n\nIf anything, I hope this was a wake-up call to them so they can see how alienating and hurtful the comments they made to you were. Reconciliation isn\u2019t impossible and you all might need to have a sit-down discussion about this. But what you did just made a point. You are not responsible for keeping the peace, or brushing their comments under the rug. You weren\u2019t even disrespectful; you just took them at their word.\n\nI also can\u2019t believe your husband doesn\u2019t have your back on this. I would\u2019ve said that your only wrong was not telling him beforehand so you could approach this as a united front, but since he reacted this way, I can understand why you waited on telling him.", "NTA And I'm sorry they treated you like that and told you something so hurtful. People who make a difference between their adopted and bio kids should not be allowed to adopt.", "NTA. Parents that favor biological children over adopted children and refer to their adopted children as not \u201creal\u201d family are messed up. But you should consider just not spending time with them if they aren\u2019t going to talk to you or treat you like family.", "NTA. How is it complicated? How are you not their family. My wife and I were seriously considering adopting but reading stories like this terrifies me. I would freeze my folks out for a solid few months if they did this to me and then ask for an apology. \n\nYears ago I confronted my parents about how my elder brother was the favorite child. My mom responded that wasn't true. That he was HER favorite child while my Dad favored me more. I was maybe 16 at the time. I'm now 37.\n\nI have since roasted her for about two decades on the subject off and on. Your parents are likely good people but that's a huge parenting error, saying those things out loud and honestly it's downright disrespectful to you. I feel you, because my experience with this scarred me so much that I only had one kid so she would always be the favorite.\n\nI would seriously sit them down and ask them what you have done to be less of a daughter than your sister. And if it's just a question of biology then explain you'd like to seriously consider being taken out of the will but also not responsible for taking care of them in their old age. So that everything is clear from the outset.\n\nI am SO sorry. What a terrible position to be in.", "is it petty? yes. are you TA? no.\n\nthey can't look past genetics after 30 years. they're the ones who are childish.\n\nalso, I'm so so sorry about all that. no one deserves this kind of disrespect.\n\nstay toxic.\n\nNTA", "NTA and that\u2019s really, upsetting and shitty of them. It\u2019s not unconditional love if they see and treat their children differently. You are no less their child than your sister is, and they specifically chose you to have you in the family. Them backtracking on that says much more about them than it ever could about you. Hope you\u2019re doing alright.", "Nta. They don't get to have it both ways. I think you made your point in a manner that was petty and respectful at the same time. And hilarious.", "NTA. Your parents don't exactly care about your feelings, saying that it will be embarrasing to be referred like that in front of the relatives. I'm sorry you're going through this, OP.", "NTA. \n\nYou did this because you were hurt by their blatant favoritism.\n\nMay they see this as a wake up call.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing \u201ccomplicated\u201d about it. You\u2019re either family or you\u2019re not and you\u2019re family, so them favoring your sister is dumb. \n\nWas calling them Mr and Mrs petty? Yes, but it\u2019s understandable.", "NTA, and I hope your sister was laughing in your support, that was the tone I was getting anyhow.\n\nMake sure your Christmas presents to them are appropriately labelled as well.", "NTA - I'm sorry that this is happening to you. I think you're being incredibly respectful considering the circumstances. You're a better person than they are.", "NTA- Sometimes being petty as hell is the only way to get the message across. When asked if you were family, they replied that it's \"complicated\" so you've uncomplicated it.", "I'd go with their first names.  NTA.", "You're so much NTA. But your husband is a bit of an asshole for not being supportive when you're adoptive parents told you that you weren't family. \n\nHopefully your sister laughing was because she was delighted to see mom and dad receive their just desserts.. but, omg. Is your husband delusional? Have your adoptive parents explained why you're not \"family\" to them?", "NTA. i'm adopted too. it's crushing to hear that the people who've raised and loved you don't truly see you as family, much less their daughter. If your \"parents\" took a clear stance on who the favorite is, and explicitly tell you that \"technically\" you are not part of the family, then you have every right to revoke that title. Why bother calling someone your parents if they don't see themselves as such? they don't want to be seen as your mom/dad? then you shouldn't be forced to call them that. i'm truly sorry this happened, and honestly you handled it way better than i ever could've.", "NTA.  Seems like a perfectly logical response to their statements.", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t go to thanksgiving.  They were extremely hurtful for no reason.

You are giving them their own medicine for how they're saying that you being adopted is \"it's complicated\".

They loved me unconditionally compared to my bio parents but as soon as my younger sister (F28)-(their bio daughter) came into the picture they started leaning towards favoring her. They still treat me well, don't get me wrong! But they have \"their moments\" especially on holidays.\n\n\nFor thanksgiving, my parents wanted someone in the family to host thanksgiving dinner because they were dealing with health problems and can not commit. I volunteered and said that I'll glady host dinner on thanksgiving but mom replied and said that my sister will do it. I asked why and after pressuring her she said that she's \"technically\" the bio daughter, she's family. I asked if I wasn't family and she and my dad said it's \"complicated\". I was livid and hurt. I decided that after this I will no longer be calling them mom and dad, yes they're nice to me but I decided to just start calling them \"mr.\" And \"mrs.\".\n\n\nSo whe they called, I referred to them as mr and mrs. When they visited I still used mr and mrs. Their reaction was to just stare in confusion but the straw was last night. We were eating dinner, and I turned to dad and said \"Mr. Clarkson...won't you pass me the salt, please\" dad looked stunned. I then said \"Mrs. Clarkson do you need help with the oven?\" She snapped and asked what the hell was that about and I told them that since they don't see me as family then why bother call them mom and dad. She and dad were furious saying it was petty and childish. My sister and her partner were laughing at this. The argument got louder and I had go leave. I said \"Goodbye mr. And mrs. Clarkson\" on the way out which made dad snap.\n\n\nHe and mom kept calling me nonstop. My husband had no idea what was going on he asked what the deal was and when I told him he agreed that it was childish and that I could've gotten the message across in a more mature way than this disrespect I'm displaying.\n\n\nAITA? They're mad as they can be and are begging me to stop or else I'll ruin thanksgiving when I start doing it infront of other relatives.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Letting them decide in private where they stand.", "Does your dad know what she said to you?", "IDK.  I think you should do it at Thanksgiving.  I\u2019m fact, when you go around the table and you say what you\u2019re thankful for this year.

If we\u2019re not missing any pertinent information here, this is the relationship they asked for.\n\nFor the life of me, I can\u2019t understand why anyone would ever prioritize DNA when they\u2019ve adopted a child.

They\u2019re lucky to have the opportunity to see you at all. \n\nI encourage you to discuss their behavior with someone they respect - your grandparents, a priest/pastor/etc., a best friend. This behavior should be brought out into the daylight, and dealt with.  I fear they won\u2019t change, and you won\u2019t be able to salvage the relationship. \n\nYou may want to go no-contact with your parents.

They want you to treat them as family while they treat you as 'its complicated' -- heck with that.", "NTA. I'm impressed you even went to them for dinner after that comment. Has your sister said anything? \n\nI really don't understand the mentality; my dad married my mum when my sister was 2 (she has a different dad). As her bio dad was still heavily involved in her life he never adopted her, she was just a stepdaughter. My parents divorced when she was 23 (15 years ago now). Despite legally and technically no longer having anything to do with her...he still considers her his daughter and she still calls him dad, and her kids call him grandad. He recently stood with her bio dad and walked her down the aisle.\nThat's because he loved her as his own for over 20 years and still does. \n\nWhat went wrong with your parents to even raise you for that length of time, referring to you as their son, and suddenly what? Change their mind??? And on top of that, they legally made that decision to adopt you! They literally chose you to be their son. \n\nThis reeks of a couple struggling to have biological children and people telling them 'adopt instead!' and doing that out of duty and treating you as a temporary stand in until they manage to conceive. \n\nI'm so sorry you're being treated like this. I think a big heart to heart is maybe needed here, is your dad aware of what your mum said?", "NTA. They\u2019re lucky you\u2019re speaking to them at all.", "NTA all the way.\n\nThat's the reason when I hear \"real kids\" or \"like your own\" or \"like they're your kids\" I always cringe, I'm not adopted, and I don't have anyone close who's adopted, but just imagining someone chosing to be your parents just to tell you you're less just because you don't share their dna is one the worst and most evil things I can think of. You're not in the wrong, I mean, I don't think you'd be wrong if you had ANY emotional reaction, I cannot start to imagine how deeply it must hurt.", "I\u2019m so sorry, this is horrible. NTA at all.

I've helped to raise and lived my SO and her three boys for almost seven years. They call me Keith, and I don't think they'll call me dad. They tell other people that I'm \"dad\".

Also your other family members will be there.  Why cut them off unnecessarily?\n\n  At first it may seem to others that using Mr & Mrs is petty, yet I maintain that it is not.
