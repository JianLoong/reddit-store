It's pretty closed minded to invalidate or dismiss one statement because of assumed subtext.", "To dismiss value in one perspective because of other conflicting perspectives is not how we increase peace on earth. Are all of his perspectives valid or enlightening? No. Does that discredit this one perspective? Not for me it doesn't. That's my opinion that WILL conflict with others and I am 100% ok with that because I accept the likelihood of conflicting opinions in a world of 9 billion people. The goal is not to find anyone that billions of people 100% agree with everything they bring to the table. The goal is to being open to finding something of value in conflicting perspectives that can benefit everyone at the table.", "The Copcake.", "Fondant Bureau of Investigation", "The gateau gestapo", "Yup! Non religious here. Married at 19 and still together happily 12 years later. We communicate freely, we love deeply, we laugh, we cry, and we support each other.

Got it. You\u2019re one of those people who think you should have special protection from anything bad possibly happening or being thought about you just because it\u2019s your wedding day", "I can't help you in the butter other than inflation/corporate greed affecting prices of everything these days, but egg prices are high because bird flu has taken out [50 million](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/why-the-ongoing-bird-flu-outbreak-is-driving-up-poultry-costs-ahead-of-thanksgiving) birds this year.", "We made friends with people who have chickens. They brought us some eggs the other day. They were so good!", "The cost of eggs is why we got ducks.  Of course, my husband didn't realize they'd go on strike most of the winter. But we did get about two dozen eggs before they did.", "That is insane! Where do you live?", "I live in what is supposed to be very cheap! I live in NE TENNESSEE!! What is happening! My eggs used to be $3.89 they are now $10.12!!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I finally got over poverty line and enjoyed that for 3months!

You're either incredibly naive or purposefully obfuscating to cover for a known fascist.", "Congrats! I'm closer to 30 than 20 and still can't imagine being married, but it's not my place to judge anyone who gets married young.

Been looking for a friend with a boat for 15yrs why not add chickens to my friend wish list!", "I have never had duck eggs! Are they good?? Are they the same as chicken eggs? Is this a stupid question??", "Oh I replied to myself like a moron..read above!", "So finding value in ONE statement from a flawed person in a world full of flawed humans is disingenuous? Good luck finding an unflawed person that billions people agree with everything they say.", "No I am open minded to finding value in a group of words regardless of the source. I doubt there would've be ZERO issues with sharing the statement \"everyone would benefit from raising their threshold of offense\" had I left the source out. You are incredibly closed minded.", "I've heard that some people can taste a difference, we mostly scramble our eggs or bake with them and I can't tell the difference (though it does depend on their diet and ours free range but also get duck food).  They're bigger and four of our ladies are jumbo birds - a couple of their eggs were about two times the size of a chicken egg.", "Whatever you need to tell yourself. You know what I call people who find value in fascist philosophy?  Fascists.", "Are they richer looking like the brown and green chicken eggs? I like that they are bigger!!!

I\u2019m thinking I would b TAH! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I think just generally fresh eggs tend to look richer than store bought eggs because they tend to be fresher.  Duck eggs have been yolks and are less watery.  We've enjoyed them.  As far as stealing from ducks in the park - I'm not sure how friendly they'd be!"]}
