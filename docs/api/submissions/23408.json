Names are the standard in every university that I\u2019ve attended. Names are particularly important in graduate school where the focus is writing and publishing research. Numbers are only effective for bias prevention when the judging authority doesn\u2019t regularly interact with the numbered subjects.

They certainly go against the ones in my country.", "NTA. That is incredibly dehumanizing. Also, the reasoning he gave is shirt.

The only time I've been referred to as a number was at soul sucking corporate jobs and prison.", "NTA, all my uni lecturers learnt our names!", "My professors always called me and all other students by name. A teacher can absolutely use his students names. I honestly wonder if he does this to avoid names he struggles to pronounce or has a religious objection to using.

I teach a college-level chemistry class with 100 students and at my college, every instructor is expected to know the name of each of their students by the end of the second week of the semester. Why? Because students who feel that their teachers actually care about them do better. They're more resilient and they're more invested in their day-to-day productivity. Often we find that students who don't yet have the maturity to be accountable to themselves  are able to thrive by making themselves accountable to a teacher they trust is actually caring about their performance.\n\nIf a teacher is concerned about fairness in their grading practices, as we all should be, then developing a well-articulated grading rubric is the way to go. Rubrics work and any teacher who isn't grading off of a rubric is a hack amateur who needs more training. \n\nReducing students to a number is a way of saying, \"I'm just not invested in you as an individual. I don't see you as an actual person.\" Instead of putting your kid in AP calculus, consider enrolling your kid at the local community college for this requirement.

It's a win-win.\n\nYTA.", "There is a reason humans have names. NTA. I see the other point of view but we ain\u2019t numbers.", "NTA to bring up your concerns and opinion on the matter. Now you know that this is a new direction for the school not just that teacher. It\u2019d be different if you went in raging and demanding the new teacher be forced to change or get fired or something. Just asking about it and not liking the idea doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.\n\nMy husband was a college professor for a number of years and he used student names to talk to his students\u2026 at least their last name. He had a class roster with names and photos of every student.\n\nI guess you will see how it works out with high school students. Will students have to learn their teacher\u2019s names and use their names instead of a teacher id number?", "You know there was a system that referred to people by numbers and it was recorded as one of the most horrific history events. Honestly myself as a parent would of pointed this out to the teacher because I am pretty sure if your child was of a certain color or religion it could be deemed pretty offensive and that teacher most likely has at least one student that it would be offensive to.", "I had a history teacher in high school who assigned us numbers for tests, essays etc. to avoid grading bias but she knew all of our names, engaged us in discussions, and was a great teacher all around. NTA", "Wow. Ok grading only by numbers to prevent bias is totally different from not learning any names at all and only using numbers. that's seriously messed up.", "Disappointed to see the OP backed down on this because she's not wrong. Students deserve to be addressed like people, not statistics.\n\nPlenty of college/university profs learn students' names, and use student IDs or nicknames on assignments to limit bias in marking.", "HS teachers are not doing this. OP either exaggerated or made this up.", "Because OP made it up", "Did your professors call students by numbers?", "Yeah if you talk to the professor often then they pick up on the name but I always just existed so I was just a number and kinda liked it.", "How is it bias-free? The teacher still know who is who.. it\u2019s exactly the same as learning names. Its just less personal and weird.\n\nHe knows the student based on one identifier and that identifier is on the assignments being graded?", "That\u2019s part of the game. Even I college sit in the front two rows and ask a question a class.", "Even in my 400 student classes I still was never *referred to* with my ID number.  We wrote them at the top of our tests, but generally the professors either knew our names or asked for them if they talked to us.  Not only are they choosing to not learn anyone\u2019s name but they\u2019re actively referring to students as numbers which makes this way way worse", "\ud83e\udee0", "Exactly this. Not sure how calling students by numbers and then grading them by numbers help with reducing bias when grading.", "Info edit- is this college or high school?  \n\nnot bc you think its wierd, I also think its wierd as hell. But its college, yes?  Your kid is legally an adult.  You need to step back.", "NTA This teacher isn\u2019t preparing them for higher education he\u2019s using that as an excuse to dehumanize his students. Never in my years of schooling (plus my parents experiences as university professors) have I head of this. It is unacceptable for high school.", "NTA. I\u2019m a strong believer that everyone should be called by their preferred name (and pronouns). Calling someone by their name is the most basic form of respect. You have a foreign sounding name? Great, I will try my best to learn it. You hate using nicknames? Ok, I\u2019ll call you by your full name. If you can\u2019t show basic human decency in the form of using someone\u2019s name, you\u2019re just an a$$.\n\nThey can write their ID # on tests for grading purposes, that\u2019s fair. But in other circumstances, what the heck?\n\nAlso, all of my professors in college knew my name.", "How does the teacher knowing a kid by their ID number prevent bias? It's one thing if the teacher learns the kid's name for interacting and then has the number as the only thing the child is identified by on the exam. But...\n\n\\*If I know Billy by Billy in class and he writes Billy on the test, I can be biased.\n\n\\*If I know Billy as 10003 in class and he puts 10003 on the exam, I still associate the exam with Billy and can be biased. \n\n\\*If I know Billy by Billy in class, but he writes 10003 on the exam and I do not have 10003 memorized as \"Billy,\" I can then grade without bias.\n\nOr is the teacher planning not to interact with the kids at all other than to present material in a lecture format? This sounds like bad teaching.\n\nNTA", "You are number 6...\n\nNTA", "I know you already edited but I think you\u2019re NTA. Using ID numbers for the tests is fine but having a teacher blatantly say they refuse to learn your name is not fostering a welcoming learning environment. He\u2019s probably the kind of shitty teacher who just loves giving students points off for stupid stuff because it gives him a power trip boner.", "NTA, idk what college she\u2019s talking about but we use our names, not ID# sounds like a dick move", "I know you added the edits, but honestly this is ridiculous of the teacher. I took very large classes in college and the professors all knew my name if I wanted them to. You can always go to office hours and things like that. But most of my classes were quite small and the professors knew each of us. I went to a very large in state school. We had ID numbers but they were rarely used. \n\nI taught AP English for a number of years and I can\u2019t imagine not knowing my students. I\u2019m a librarian now with almost 1000 students and I still work to learn all their names.", "NTA, in college (a huge university) many of my professors would make an effort to learn names", "NTA and your edit doesn\u2019t make sense. He can use the ID for testing and still care enough to learn your child\u2019s names. This is a teacher who doesn\u2019t give a damn about their classes, clearly. \nIf you cared about people and their education, you\u2019d want to know their names.", "Both of my parents are university professors too and would never in a million years call students just by their number. Hell they didn\u2019t do that to us in the military. I don\u2019t like it.", "How did they know your number though? Are you holding up a placard like at an auction when you want to ask a question?", "It\u2019s true. My parents are both university professors and they always make an effort to learn the names of their students. It keeps the students engaged, and is just nicer in general. Coming from a country where even addressing teacher and professors in formal language is abnormal (we go with first names only for everyone, even our king) this whole ID number thing comes of as appalling.", "Currently in grad school. Our professors absolutely learn our names, but several ask us not to on papers/tests/submissions so that they can control for their own implicit bias. I find this balance great.", "Right! When you go to college and focus on a certain subject, you get to know your professors and they get to know you. I studied English lit but I had the same prof for all my math classes so he knew my name. Same thing with bio and astronomy. My Spanish prof thanked me for the article I had written about Cinco de Mayo for the student newspaper. He knew I had written it because he knew my name (and called it out across the quad to thank me). Perhaps it's different in big, ivy league colleges but that would be the exception, not the rule.", "The issue isn\u2019t assignments though. It\u2019s normal to have assignments in an ID number. What\u2019s not normal is to refuse to learn any names at all. Or calling someone by their ID number in conversation which seems to be the issue here. At that point you are going out of your way to not use someone\u2019s name to the point that simply using their name would in fact have been easier. It makes no sense.", "When a student comes in for office hours, do you refuse to learn their names? Or do you pick up a few names naturally in the course of a semester? I would assume you learn a few names naturally, right?", "My children's student number has been important since they were in elementary. Yes, they'll use it, but he is being ridiculous and really doesn't understand how things work. How will he call on students to answer? How will he call them out if they misbehave?", "It is something that I actually experienced at the university. To ensure bias-free grading, we were assigned codes at the beginning of exams. But, this was only done during exam terms. \n\nIn the classroom, I would definitely find it weird to be coded.", "Completely agree. I had teachers in high school and professors in college that did the exact same thing\u2014they assigned a number or had us use our student number for grading purposes. But they didn\u2019t call me by my number\u2026 that would\u2019ve defeated the point of non-bias grading.", "And that would be fair, I think.  I don't think the professor in this instance would have a problem with that.", "If they do then they would be hypocrite"]}
