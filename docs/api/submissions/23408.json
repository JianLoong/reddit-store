Names are the standard in every university that I\u2019ve attended. Names are particularly important in graduate school where the focus is writing and publishing research. Numbers are only effective for bias prevention when the judging authority doesn\u2019t regularly interact with the numbered subjects.

The teacher will be regularly interacting with each student and will naturally associate the students with their numbers as if the numbers were names.

They certainly go against the ones in my country.", "NTA. That is incredibly dehumanizing. Also, the reasoning he gave is shirt. While professors in large lectures aren't going to  learn everyone's names, students still write their names on their papers (with or without their student ID). If he can learn all of their ID numbers, he can put some effort into learning their names.", "Nta. Every professor in college knew students' names.  You stood up for students.

The only time I've been referred to as a number was at soul sucking corporate jobs and prison.", "NTA, all my uni lecturers learnt our names!", "My professors always called me and all other students by name. A teacher can absolutely use his students names. I honestly wonder if he does this to avoid names he struggles to pronounce or has a religious objection to using.

I teach a college-level chemistry class with 100 students and at my college, every instructor is expected to know the name of each of their students by the end of the second week of the semester. Why? Because students who feel that their teachers actually care about them do better. They're more resilient and they're more invested in their day-to-day productivity. Often we find that students who don't yet have the maturity to be accountable to themselves  are able to thrive by making themselves accountable to a teacher they trust is actually caring about their performance.\n\nIf a teacher is concerned about fairness in their grading practices, as we all should be, then developing a well-articulated grading rubric is the way to go. Rubrics work and any teacher who isn't grading off of a rubric is a hack amateur who needs more training. \n\nReducing students to a number is a way of saying, \"I'm just not invested in you as an individual. I don't see you as an actual person.\" Instead of putting your kid in AP calculus, consider enrolling your kid at the local community college for this requirement. That's the actual best way for your kid to fulfill college credits and get a college experience.
