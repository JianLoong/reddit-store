My parents divorced when I was 5. My brother and I were close and he stayed over at our house a lot until I was around 12 yo. After some personal stuff between him and my mom and work on his side we sadly drifted apart and maybe saw each other 1-2 times a year.\n\nMy brother called me last year telling me was getting 'engaged' (in our culture the grooms family goes to the brides home to ask for her hand in marriage from her family. It was about that) and said he really wanted me there. I was excited and agreed, hoping that this would be a good time to try and reconnect. My mom encouraged me to go, but she seemed upset that it was 'last minute' (he called me a week before) and asked if he planned on buying me a dress. I said I didn't need a dress because I already had one at home that would fit. She didn't say much more  after that. \n\nAfterwards our relationship became much better and we hung out more.\n\nWhere I'm from most couples get married before the actual wedding. My brother and his now-wife got married a week before their wedding and again, my mom asked me if my brother was going to buy me a dress. I said I didn't need a new one because I had one at home. She held her tongue but it was obvious she was annoyed and upset.\n\nThen, the night before the wedding, my mom exploded over the dress thing. She said that she could overlook my brother not buying me a dress until now but she couldn't overlook the disrespect he was showing towards me as his sister by not buying one for his actual wedding. \nHe did ask me if I wanted to go dress shopping. I declined since I had a dress at home. It was one I wore to my cousins wedding a few years back and it still fit me. I told her as much.\n\nShe said that she won't allow her daughter to be 'humiliated'. What would people think if I wore an 'inappropriate dress for the grooms sister'. I said I didn't care and that the dress was very much appropriate.\nShe then said that my brother was treating me like a guest and how he never looked after me during all of this. I said that he always made me appointments for hair&makeup.\nMy mother said I was blind to how my brother has been treating me because I've idolized him, that he only wants me there because he wants to keep up face with his wife and in-laws, showing them how 'great of a brother he is'. Then she took my keys and hid them away so I couldn't leave.\n\nI didn't get my keys back so I had to call my brother and tell him I couldn't come to the wedding.\n\nEver since then I've been ignoring my mother. She's tried to talk to me and tell me she was sorry but that she only had my best interest in mind.\n\nI don't really see the issue in how my brother was treating me. I was happy to rebuild our relationship. I don't know if I can forgive my mother for making me miss his wedding.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694984702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lc55m/aita_for_ignoring_my_mom_after_she_didnt_let_me/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Locking you in is unforgivable and by no means normal. She does not have your interest in mind, not at all - she is holding a grudge against your brother and is acting out on it.

However I do find it silly to buy a new dress (especially since you're not a bridesmaid) If you have one why spend money you may not have on another one that would only be worn once!", "NTA. I'm not sure what the cultural expectations are for you, but this sounds pretty outrageous since you said he did offer to get you a dress and you declined. Whether she thought it was disrespectful or not, she way overstepped and treated you like a child. You're not a child and you are justified in being upset with her.", "NTA.  Your mother definitely did not have your best interests in mind.  You are an adult and your mother taking your keys was childish.  The sooner you can get away from your mother the better.

You're 20, why can't you call a taxi, a Uber, some friends to give you a lift. Instead you just decide she'd win, and stay home ?", "NTA. Your mom is the AH. Obviously.

Some things can't be apologized for and making you miss your brother's wedding is one of them. She did not have your best interests at heart-- only her own pettiness.", "NTA", "I also think she's been holding a grudge since whatever happened between them. The few times my brother and I saw each other over the years it was about stuff I needed like a new phone, a new laptop for school/work or some money for a school trip.

My mother has a very... explosive personality and I just really wanna get away from that", "I don't have anywhere I could stay at if I went to the wedding. I couldn't get back home since I had no keys. I have a cat too which my mother has threatened to give away plenty times so I couldn't risk that either. I'm saving up to move out hopefully soon to get away from her", "Believe me: She IS holding a grudge for something. You said he is your half brother from your dads first wife, right?

I don't really want to intrude on a newly wed couple", "I get my bank statements emailed to me, instead of actual paper copies mailed. If you get them emailed, then less chance of her finding out that you have another bank account. \n\nIf she has access to your email, then get another one and use that for the important stuff.", "I understand that completely. It may be worth talking to your brother at least about everything that's going on if he doesnt already know. \n\nWhen he is back from his honeymoon that is", "Do you speak with your father is he aware of how things are with your mum?
