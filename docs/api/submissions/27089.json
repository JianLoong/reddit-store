My parents divorced when I was 5. My brother and I were close and he stayed over at our house a lot until I was around 12 yo. After some personal stuff between him and my mom and work on his side we sadly drifted apart and maybe saw each other 1-2 times a year.\n\nMy brother called me last year telling me was getting 'engaged' (in our culture the grooms family goes to the brides home to ask for her hand in marriage from her family. It was about that) and said he really wanted me there. I was excited and agreed, hoping that this would be a good time to try and reconnect. My mom encouraged me to go, but she seemed upset that it was 'last minute' (he called me a week before) and asked if he planned on buying me a dress. I said I didn't need a dress because I already had one at home that would fit. She didn't say much more  after that. \n\nAfterwards our relationship became much better and we hung out more.\n\nWhere I'm from most couples get married before the actual wedding. My brother and his now-wife got married a week before their wedding and again, my mom asked me if my brother was going to buy me a dress. I said I didn't need a new one because I had one at home. She held her tongue but it was obvious she was annoyed and upset.\n\nThen, the night before the wedding, my mom exploded over the dress thing. She said that she could overlook my brother not buying me a dress until now but she couldn't overlook the disrespect he was showing towards me as his sister by not buying one for his actual wedding. \nHe did ask me if I wanted to go dress shopping. I declined since I had a dress at home. It was one I wore to my cousins wedding a few years back and it still fit me. I told her as much.\n\nShe said that she won't allow her daughter to be 'humiliated'. What would people think if I wore an 'inappropriate dress for the grooms sister'. I said I didn't care and that the dress was very much appropriate.\nShe then said that my brother was treating me like a guest and how he never looked after me during all of this. I said that he always made me appointments for hair&makeup.\nMy mother said I was blind to how my brother has been treating me because I've idolized him, that he only wants me there because he wants to keep up face with his wife and in-laws, showing them how 'great of a brother he is'. Then she took my keys and hid them away so I couldn't leave.\n\nI didn't get my keys back so I had to call my brother and tell him I couldn't come to the wedding.\n\nEver since then I've been ignoring my mother. She's tried to talk to me and tell me she was sorry but that she only had my best interest in mind.\n\nI don't really see the issue in how my brother was treating me. I was happy to rebuild our relationship. I don't know if I can forgive my mother for making me miss his wedding.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694984702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lc55m/aita_for_ignoring_my_mom_after_she_didnt_let_me/", "score": 301, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure what the cultural expectations are for you, but this sounds pretty outrageous since you said he did offer to get you a dress and you declined. Whether she thought it was disrespectful or not, she way overstepped and treated you like a child. You're not a child and you are justified in being upset with her.", "NTA.

You're 20, why can't you call a taxi, a Uber, some friends to give you a lift. Instead you just decide she'd win, and stay home ?", "NTA. Your mom is the AH. Obviously. Her concept of \u201cbest interests\u201d as attempting to destroy your other filial relationships is petty, particularly after being told that it was your decision", "Out of curiosity, why does your mother think that her ex-husband\u2019s son from before her marriage owes her anything?", "NTA and what your mother did was not only crazy, it was unforgivable. Some things can't be apologized for and making you miss your brother's wedding is one of them. She did not have your best interests at heart-- only her own pettiness.", "NTA", "I also think she's been holding a grudge since whatever happened between them. The few times my brother and I saw each other over the years it was about stuff I needed like a new phone, a new laptop for school/work or some money for a school trip. She always said 'that's the least he can do' while never saying anything nice about him but she never tried to not make me see him or talk to him like this before", "Turkey but I'm a 3rd gen from an immigrant family in germany", "I'm saving up to do just that. My mother has a very... explosive personality and I just really wanna get away from that", "I don't have anywhere I could stay at if I went to the wedding. I couldn't get back home since I had no keys. I have a cat too which my mother has threatened to give away plenty times so I couldn't risk that either. I'm saving up to move out hopefully soon to get away from her", "Believe me: She IS holding a grudge for something. You said he is your half brother from your dads first wife, right? If so, I bet your Mom hates him and holds a grudge against him just for that.\n\nYour mother is absolutely (sorry for my language) batshit crazy.\n\nMove out, as fast as you can.\n\nNTA", "Start gathering your important paperwork;\nBirth certificate, Social Security etc. Of course your equivalents there in Germany. \n\nDo not tell your mother.

Get paperless statements.", "Would it be an option to move in with your brother and his new wife for a while until you can finance your own place? \n\nI'm sorry your dealing with this", "Thank you for the suggestion! Will definitely do that.\n\nI'm sorry but what are paperless statements? Sorry, I have no idea about stuff like this much", "They are on their honeymoon right now so I can't ask but I don't know. I don't really want to intrude on a newly wed couple", "I get my bank statements emailed to me, instead of actual paper copies mailed. If you get them emailed, then less chance of her finding out that you have another bank account. \n\nIf she has access to your email, then get another one and use that for the important stuff.", "I understand that completely. It may be worth talking to your brother at least about everything that's going on if he doesnt already know. \n\nWhen he is back from his honeymoon that is", "Do you speak with your father is he aware of how things are with your mum? X", "Oh. Yeah, I have online banking so I get mine through there, no physical copies. I had my own account since I was 16 and refused to share any info with my mom even though she did ask for it", "NTA.

If she tries it again, ransack her room and find those keys!", "NTA you want a brother, your mother wants an ATM.

I think there maybe some cultural nuances at play here, but your moms also being a jerk and damaging your relationship with your brother.", "NTA\n\nSounds like mum is a control freak", "NTA\n\nHonestly, your mother crossed a line. At 20 years of age you have the authority to go wherever you please, but your mother withheld your keys, something you own, to prevent you from going against her wishes. She didn't exactly lock you inside a place, but she also didn't give you a lot of options other than to do what she wanted, which was toxically controlling. She deserves your silence, and she'll be lucky if that silence doesn't break with you telling her what she did was unforgivable regardless of how much she tries to dress it up.", "NTA. Your mother has no right to keep you from leaving. That\u2019s actually illegal and you should have called the police. Ignoring her is way too mild for what she did.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if your mother\u2019s opinion was based in fact or was ridiculous.\n\nYou are 20.  You could choose to go in a clown costume if you\u2019d wanted to.  She had no right to take that decision into her own hands.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Move out and cut all contact with your mother.  Who the hell does she think she is?\n\n>She's tried to talk to me and tell me she was sorry but that she only had my best interest in mind.\n\nBULLSHIT.  She threw a tantrum to serve her ego, and you paid the price.", "Nta why are you still living with this women and letting her control your life and relationships.", "NTA, but from one of your replies I gather you don\u2019t know what drive the wedge between your mum and brother, you need to ask what that was and find out what she\u2019s holding a grudge about as it could explain some things for you \n\nIt may not and might just be her being controlling but I do think it\u2019s worth asking", "Dude she's threatened to give away OPs cat whenever OP hasn't done what she wants, it's well beyond \"pettiness.\"\n\nMother's batshit nuts and incredibly abusive.", "She's being pretty seriously emotionally abused by her Mom, based on the responses. It's hard to leave those situations.", "Excuse me?! It\u2019s HER responsibility to provide you with these things (at least until you became an adult), not your brothers. NTA. Are you in a position to be able to leave?", "She's trying to hold you as a hostage for his money. She'll let you see him if he pays.", "Hallo und Gr\u00fc\u00dfe aus dem s\u00fcdlichen Nachbarland :) You know that locking you in the house is illegal here, right?\n\nAlso, this isn't about you not talking to your mother. This is about you living in an abusive household.", "I'm wondering what customs we are having here. Is it customary for the brother to buy a dress for his sister for his wedding? Is the OP able to move out of her mother's house or does her culture prohibit this?"]}
