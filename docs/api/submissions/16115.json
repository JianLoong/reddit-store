A month ago, she asked if I wanted to move in together to start off the school year (she\u2019s still in college). It sounded fun, so I agreed.\n\nUs looking for an apartment soon turned into just me looking, and doing all the work that followed. This wouldn\u2019t have bothered me, I\u2019m a planner, but she would ask me to do things she could have easily done herself, such as contacting complexes, scheduling tours, and communicating with the realtors. Again, as a planner, this still wouldn\u2019t have bothered me, but her list of demands quickly grew unreasonable.\n\nHer demands included:\nThe apartment must be walking distance to school\nSafe area\nDishwasher/washer/dryer in unit\nPets-ok (she has a dog)\nTwo bathrooms\nMUST have windows (she smokes)\nWindows MUST open (no flats)\nWindows MUST have a screen\nNO carpeting, hardwood only. Carpets are \u201cgross.\u201d\nLoose quiet hours (she wants to throw parties)\n\nI thought these were preference, but Ellie refused to compromise at all.\n\nAfter tireless searching, I found two places that met her needs. I asked her when to start touring, and she picked the DAY before we had to make a final decision. I warned her then that we would need to make a decision within 24 hours. She agreed.\n\nWe toured. The first was a no from both, and the second place I LOVED. It met all needs, was a 20 minute walk from her school, and we would each only pay $800/m. I thought it was the obvious choice, but she nitpicked. She said it was \u201ctoo small\u201d (800-900 sq ft), and 20 minutes was \u201ctoo far to walk.\u201d It\u2019s worth mentioning she was set on a furnished student housing for $1200/m (which I def cant afford, she\u2019s using student loans.)\n\nShe suggested we tour other places, and I\u2019ll admit that\u2019s when I blew up a bit. I said there WERE no other options due to her inflexibility, and we ran out of time because she wanted to start at the last possible second. I told her I was done looking, and it was all up to her, otherwise I would be moving elsewhere.\n\nShe panicked a bit after that, and after a day or so she agreed to the place.\n\nThe problem now is, the apartment we chose has two bedrooms, but only one has a connected bathroom (the master), and the other has a \u201ccommunal\u201d bathroom. She said she wants the master bedroom because she would want to put her dogs puppy pads in the bathroom, as well as smoke in the shower.\n\nHowever, I think those reasons are BS. She can put the pads anywhere, and she can smoke in front of the window in the living room or pay $15 for a smoke filter. \n\nPersonally, I think I should have the master bedroom. I\u2019m the one who stressed myself out from all the work to get us the place, and took every one of her needs into consideration.

The obvious answer is one of you pay an extra $100 a month for it.\n\nBut you are setting yourself up for disaster.", "Typically the one who gets the master bedroom pays more. So if rent is $1,600 total, the one getting the master should pay $850 or $900 and the other one then pays $750 or $700.

If it\u2019s not too late, RUN.", "1. Dont like with her.\n\n2. Whoever gets the master should have a slightly higher rent. 850/750. Or 900/700. Heck if she was gonna pay for a 1200 dollar place, make it 1000/600.", "NTA but the puppy pad thing makes sense. I think you should give her the room, but make her pay higher rent for it. Apparently she has the budget too.", "Why are you worried about being TA, when you would so clearly be The Idiot for living with her in the first place? Why can't you see that she would be a horrible roommate?

The amount of damage I had to repair and tar/smoke residue I had to clean was staggering. It got everywhere and on everything. It took forever to clean that place. Most rentals don't allow indoor smoking for a reason. OP should review the lease before allowing roommate to smoke indoors. Ever since my first rental I messed up, I only smoke outdoors. Won't even smoke in the car. If I need a smoke, whelp there's stops on the highways for a reason and it's a great chance to stretch the legs out.", "Yea I like how she thinks carpet is \u201cgross\u201d but plans on smoking inside", "This is the way. Back in my apartment sharing days, whoever had the bigger room kicked in a little more on rent every month.", "Money is the definition of fungible.", "Or she could walk her dogs.", "That means you probably won't eat her food, not the other way around. I have heard enough stories about omnivores eating up all the vegetarian options.", "Then she will eat all your vegan snacks and then say have some of mine which won\u2019t be vegan. She\u2019ll cook meat in your pans and then not clean them. She will smoke inside without the windows open bc it\u2019s too hot/cold. She will party and invite others over when you have a big exam or paper sue the next day.

You just know this is going to be a fight every day with her", "NTA\n\nI did all the work for my apartment in college and I demanded the larger room.

At least $100 more.", "NTA, getting the master bedroom seems like the very least of compromises considering she has been unwilling to make ANY compromises so far and wouldn\u2019t put in any of the work until you put your foot down. My question is: Wtf do you want to live with someone who smokes in the house? It doesn\u2019t matter one bit if she does it in front of an open window- your entire house and belongings are going to smell like cigs eventually. My response to the whole \u201cmust have windows in bathroom that can open with screens\u201d ridiculousness would have been \u201cthat\u2019s a non-issue because you\u2019re not going to be smoking inside, period. or you can find another roommate\u201d and I say this as someone who smokes. This whole process- her demands, her unwillingness to compromise, and her dumping the workload on you- all screams that she is going to be a nightmare to live with.", "NTA, you should be rewarded for your efforts and she should NOT be rewarded for her brattiness.\n\nIn my experience it\u2019s the decent thing to do to let the roommate who made the most effort finding the place have the biggest bedroom. It\u2019s horribly unfair otherwise.", "I mean I wouldn\u2019t want to live with someone who smokes inside and hasn\u2019t bothered to potty train her dog. Your opening yourself up to lost deposits for her damages. I highly encourage not signing a lease with this person. \nIF you go ahead-  The bigger room should go to someone who pays more for it. Also consider, which bathroom is used when guests/ parties are happening.", "INFO \n\n>She said she wants the master bedroom because she would want to put her dogs puppy pads in the bathroom, as well as smoke in the shower.\n\nShe wants to smoke in the shower?

Or will it just piss and shit in the flat......the flat that you don't own  and are required by the landlord to keep in good order. Bet you don't see that damages deposit again", "NTA. But don\u2019t move in with her", "A 20 year old who refuses to compromise on anything at all, who wants to smoke inside and have her dog piss inside the apartment. \n\nThat sounds like absolute hell to live with.", "NTA.\n\nYou have made a mistake. Already through the process you described, it's pretty clear she is entirely self absorbed and doesn't care about your needs or wants out of a place. Why did you ever agree??\n\nI have to ask:\nDoes the lease state anything about smoking? If it is a smoke-free apartment, you are going to get screwed over because of her, and potentially have consequences because of her bad habit. I notice it wasn't \"smoke-free\" as a requirement, but that the bathroom needs windows... The implications tells me she is trashy.\n\nAnd does the lease say anything about noise at certain times? Most apartments clearly state that there is a period of time where there isn't to be any disruption. If you signed an agreement where this is a case and she tries to throw late parties, this is also a serious issue and risk to you. I, for one, will not hesitate to file complaints against inconsiderate assholes that are loud at late hours of the night when it's been plainly stated it's to be quiet.\n\nIf the lease is against these two points that she insists on...yikes. You might want to have a discussion, either with her or the landlord.\n\nShe sounds like a very needy and demanding person. The absolute least she can do is give you the nicer room for meeting her requirements! Good luck OP, something tells me it'll get worse.", "NTA but you two are not compatible as long term roommates.", "NTA\n\nHowever, I am thinking that this will not be a good roommate situation. If she is this demanding and unhelpful is doing the basics before you live together, I can only imagine the nightmare she will be after moving in together.", "NTA and if she is smoking cigarettes that stench will permeate the apartment if she does it inside. She needs to go out to smoke.", "You are NTA, but do you really want to live with someone who's game plan for caring for their dog is to plan for them peeing in the house as a main option? There's no way this dog is going to be well behaved based off the roommate description. Bad people raise bad dogs", "NTA but take it from me, I have worked in student housing for several years now.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t sound good. This sounds miserable.\n\nI imagine you will be doing all the cleaning and all the grocery shopping. Probably looking after her dog as well.", "NTA but you don't want to live with this person.  Serious red flags and reading the comments, even more.\n\nLiving with a smoker along is bad even if the smoke outside.  They smell like smoke and bring it into the apartment.   And she already told you she intends to smoke even though it's not allowed.  Serious red flag waving.\n\nYou can find something/someone better.    \n\nAnd in general, whomever gets the master bedroom with an attach bathroom should be paying more.  You probably should get first right to get it since you did all the work to find the place, but if you did get it, you should pay more for it.", "That the dog doesn't just pee in the apartment accidentally is the wild part. It's the roommates plan to let the dog pee inside instead of caring for the dog", "You can auction off the room to make it fair.  If rent is $1600.  You ask both roommates would they take the bigger room for $825?  What about $850?  There is a price where both roommates are happy", "Exactly - I'd pay more to have that and the private bath.", "Excellent point", "Could be why she hates carpets. Smoker plus the puppy pad comment leads me to assume any carpets in a place she lived would absolutely become gross really quickly. I smoked for years; that stench in carpets is revolting and incredibly hard to get rid of. I don't even want to think about adding an unhousebroken pet to that.", "I'm in an apartment and the neighbor above smokes weed indoors despite the no-smoking rules. Guess what? Our apartment smells like weed all the time and we can't do much about it. We don't smoke it personally because it gives my partner nasty migraines. I run a million purifiers through our place to make it so the neighbors aren't giving my partner migraines all the time. It sort of helps, but not much.\n\nAnd management knows without having to be told because they can smell it from outside the building. Maintenance isn't fooled. The old neighbor across the hall was evicted for weed (we didn't know that's why they were evicted until much later). And we also recently found out our neighbor above us didn't get their contract renewed.\n\nYou can't hide the weed smell.

I too, made mistakes like this in college, thinking it would all work out. Narrator... ^it ^didn't.\n\nShe's already shown you how she is going to act. Are you going to plow forward assuming that's going to change? You'd be insane to either not find another roommate or rescind your application. Finding another place or another roommate is going to be a lot less hell than dealing with this person for a year.", "If you view veganism as purely a diet, then nothing. If you view it as a lifestyle that seeks to  do as little harm as possible to animals, then tobacco isn\u2019t vegan, as the global tobacco industry is implicated in many human deaths and adverse health outcomes for the human animals.", "Don't move in with her. This is a preview. It's currently a mostly consequence free preview. She is going to be a financial liability. Don't tie your rental history together with someone who plans to smoke inside and throw what sounds like large parties, you'll never get your security deposit back. If she can't be bothered to tour or fill out the application, she may not be bothered to pay rent. Get a one bedroom or studio for yourself and cut her loose. You don't want to spend the next decade potentially paying for the various financial mistakes one can endure from a bad roommate.", "NTA but you'd be crazy to move in with her.

She's going to make you miserable.", "If your name's on the lease & you did all the work, I agree you should get the master bedroom.  NTA.  Good luck with this roommate.  It sounds like it's going to be a nightmare living with her.", "NTA Op, If it feels like you HAVE to make a \"correct\" decision for both of you, you don't. You've already put so much work in. Moving in with her now may feel like a big waste of your time. But imagine truly wasting your time living with this person. If you push for the master room and get it, which you absolutely deserve. You know she will play childish games to get back at you. Save yourself so much time and sanity, live alone or with someone who will respect you and your space.", "NTA, use the parties as the reason her bathroom should be the communal one! She wants parties, guests have to use her bathroom.", "NTA. But, even if you do get the master bedroom you're in for a very very nasty surprise if you get a place together.

You will regret living with this person.", "NAH - You can demand without being an asshole.\nSounds like a dumb idea to start off a year lease like that, though. Instead of demanding, why not offer that whoever wants the master bedroom will pay $100 extra, that would help with your budget.", "NTA,  but trust the responses- you do NOT want to live with this person. She wants to smoke in the shower? Is it even a smoking apartment? she wants to throw parties? You realize if you have the communal bathroom all of her party guests will use THAT bathroom.

Or advertise through the university for a roommate?", "Pot, not cigs", "That makes me wonder if the dog is housebroken. When I had dogs & they were puppies, I had puppy pads for them & crated them when I wasn't going to be home. Once they were completely housebroken & the accidents stopped, the crates were put away & I gave the unused puppy pads to a neighbor.", "This is major concern.

It\u2019s great that you are a planner but I doubt that you are going to want to take on all the responsibilities once you have moved in together, let alone deal with all the new issues that will arise when any two people cohabitate.
