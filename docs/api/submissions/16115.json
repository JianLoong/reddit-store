A month ago, she asked if I wanted to move in together to start off the school year (she\u2019s still in college). It sounded fun, so I agreed.\n\nUs looking for an apartment soon turned into just me looking, and doing all the work that followed. This wouldn\u2019t have bothered me, I\u2019m a planner, but she would ask me to do things she could have easily done herself, such as contacting complexes, scheduling tours, and communicating with the realtors. Again, as a planner, this still wouldn\u2019t have bothered me, but her list of demands quickly grew unreasonable.\n\nHer demands included:\nThe apartment must be walking distance to school\nSafe area\nDishwasher/washer/dryer in unit\nPets-ok (she has a dog)\nTwo bathrooms\nMUST have windows (she smokes)\nWindows MUST open (no flats)\nWindows MUST have a screen\nNO carpeting, hardwood only. Carpets are \u201cgross.\u201d\nLoose quiet hours (she wants to throw parties)\n\nI thought these were preference, but Ellie refused to compromise at all.\n\nAfter tireless searching, I found two places that met her needs. I asked her when to start touring, and she picked the DAY before we had to make a final decision. I warned her then that we would need to make a decision within 24 hours. She agreed.\n\nWe toured. The first was a no from both, and the second place I LOVED. It met all needs, was a 20 minute walk from her school, and we would each only pay $800/m. I thought it was the obvious choice, but she nitpicked. She said it was \u201ctoo small\u201d (800-900 sq ft), and 20 minutes was \u201ctoo far to walk.\u201d It\u2019s worth mentioning she was set on a furnished student housing for $1200/m (which I def cant afford, she\u2019s using student loans.)\n\nShe suggested we tour other places, and I\u2019ll admit that\u2019s when I blew up a bit. I said there WERE no other options due to her inflexibility, and we ran out of time because she wanted to start at the last possible second. I told her I was done looking, and it was all up to her, otherwise I would be moving elsewhere.\n\nShe panicked a bit after that, and after a day or so she agreed to the place.\n\nThe problem now is, the apartment we chose has two bedrooms, but only one has a connected bathroom (the master), and the other has a \u201ccommunal\u201d bathroom. She said she wants the master bedroom because she would want to put her dogs puppy pads in the bathroom, as well as smoke in the shower.\n\nHowever, I think those reasons are BS. She can put the pads anywhere, and she can smoke in front of the window in the living room or pay $15 for a smoke filter. \n\nPersonally, I think I should have the master bedroom. I\u2019m the one who stressed myself out from all the work to get us the place, and took every one of her needs into consideration. Plus, my name is on the lease as the primary residence because so far I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s filled out the application. \n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I demanded the master bedroom in the apartment?", "created_utc": 1682916860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134d02h/wibta_for_demanding_the_master_bedroom/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Come up with a value that is worth it for you, say $900/month. It might suck if you are priced out of the room. But if she agrees to pay $1k and you pay $600 instead of your 800/800 split, you can save some serious money. This cna be renegotiated when your lease renews.
