A lot of people thought I was my boss's favorite, but I think it was just his ability to utilize me for different positions that made me a standout.\n\nProblem was, me and boss had multplie conversations about how I was fed up being more qualified than half his managers for the position, and yet every time a conversation about me moving up would happen, he'd give some lame excuse. The last excuse was \"well, continue with your sobriety and we'll talk.\" Granted yes, I was a severe alcoholic and he knew this! But i never once allowed my drinking to affect my work at all! I still came in, busted my ass for 40+ hours every week, and even offered to stay when they were short on closers.\n\nLast week he fired my boyfriend, and even though I made it explicitly known when he was originally hired that me and him were nothing more than coworkers on the clock, his work performance seemed to be the catalyst to why I couldn't move up there. Everyone had to bitch to me whenever he did something wrong. I told all the managers and my boss that his work performance shouldn't be credited above my own, especially as I'd be willing to cover his shifts whenever he decided he wouldn't be there! \n\nAfter being promised a promotion I never received, being harassed for my boyfriends performance, and a well loved manager walking out as well this week, I decided I was done and wasn't going to return.

The reason you didn't get promoted is that you were too useful where you were.  You could do it all, that's where management wanted you, and that's where you were going to stay.", "Never the ah for this in my opinion. It's not like they give us one we they decide to can us. Especially not in the fast food industry though. \n\nThat said, you should either rid yourself of the dead weight in your life (boyfriend) or at the very least refuse to ever work at the same company as him again. He's dragging you down and telling people it shouldn't won't change the effects that his laziness has on their perception of you. \n\nLastly I truly hope you continue to work on your sobriety. It sounds like you are an intelligent hard working individual and you deserve to advance and succeed so I hope you find what works for you to move any obstacles out of the way.", "NTA- That's a bridge that's meant to be burned. Pigeonholing is a real thing, and not just in entertainment. Here's the thing, you were *TOO GOOD* at your job, and they knew that letting you go on to management would leave them in rough spot. This was their plan all along, string you until you couldn't do it anymore, but jokes on them. Now the remaining managers have to do the jobs of 2 managers, since you were just about the most knowledgeable, and maybe even more so than other actual managers. I've never worked in fast food, but I'm guessing they need at least 10 people to replace you and that beloved manager.", "NTA.  You can quit at any time, with or without notice.  The flip side of that is you can be fired at any time, with or without notice.  A good manager who wants to keep a valuable employee will find a way to motivate that employee to stay.  If the employee leaves, that is on the manager.  People don't quit jobs, they quit managers.", "Nta if you're US based most jobs  2 weeks is a courtesy.", "NTA. 2 weeks notice is a courtesy, not a requirement. They've done you the courtesy to treat you like that and you've given them the courtesy of walking out without another word.", "NTA When you're at your wits end, it's over. A job should should not be a burden. I applaud this generation, they've embody the spirit of \"take this job and shove it, I don't work here anymore.\" There is nothing wrong with not letting people deminimize you because they think they can.", "NTA.  \n\n\nEmployers don't give anyone 2 weeks notice when they let them go, it's ridiculous that they think they are owed 2 weeks notice.", "NTA\n\nTwo weeks notice is a courtesy, not a requirement. If you were to be fired you wouldn't get notice", "NTA", "NTA\u2014employers don\u2019t give notice when they fire someone, why should they get the same?", "I don't feel like Wendy's is a place that requires notice be given.", "NTA. Good for you!", "NTA. There's a really weird part of American work culture where a lot of companies tend to hire outside their workplace, rather than giving promotions to the hard workers already there. It sounds like what happened to you. Maybe your work was such high quality that having you there was like having a bonus manager but on a regular employee's salary.", "NTA. Ma'am, this is a Wendy's.\n\nYou aren't a medical professional or responsible for million dollar contracts or construction. Worst case scenario, someone might have to wait a few more minutes for their fries. I am not trying to be mean or belittling... if I disappeared tomorrow and never went back to work, someone might have to walk on a slightly dirty floor. I am just saying that your job isn't life or death.\n\nThe fact that you told them you weren't coming back is a step up from those that just stop coming in.", "they don\u2019t give a notice when they fire you, so why should you have to give a notice?", "NTA. Giving notice is a courtesy you give to a job that gives you respect. You were a great employee but weren't respected due to them not promoting you, them making your boyfriend's problems your problems, and mentioning your sobriety as a condition of your promotion despite it never affecting your performance.", "NTA\n\nYou were being taken advantage of - your manager was never going to promote you when you were his most versatile employee.", "NTA.  Did they give your boyfriend a 2 week notice when they fired him?  Would they give you a 2 week notice if they fired you?   Seems like companies in the us only think this courtesy goes one way.", "If you didn't recommend your BF for the position, involving you in his hiring, firing and work ethic is wholly inappropriate. I see that you are 30 but you missed some good life lessons: 1) don't tell your employer about illnesses unless they affect you on the job & only if you are asking for accommodation 2) your workplace doesn't need to know who you are dating.", "This whole thing sounds hella messy. Way more going on here than it sounds like on the surface.  YTA for how this was written and not fully explained.  You didn\u2019t even explain why you think you might be and AH just all the reasons you don\u2019t think you should be", "YTA Mostly because if you'll quit without notice, you probably weren't the model employee you thout you were and there is a reason you didn't get the promotion.", "Were you justified? Maybe? Quitting without notice is kind of an asshole move. And it's a little weird to say that your boyfriend's work performance was not related to you, but then telling folks you quit because he got fired. Fwiw, quitting without notice will also make it harder for you to get a new job. Overall, this kind of behavior probably made your boss believe he was right for not promoting you.\n\nSo even if this felt good at the time, probably YTA", "Sorry, yta. \n\nMore to yourself than the job, but still.\n\nThere are good reasons to walk out without notice. None of those were here. You were upset at not getting promoted, at your manager's quitting and your BF's sacking. That's more than enough reason to quit ( and you don't need a reason to quit!).\n\nBut without notice wasn't good.", "TBH I kinda get it. You've shared too much with your boss and there're two reasons presented which would give them pause for thought in promoting you. Unless there's some reason of safety or your company is failing to pay etc. I'll always say that quitting without notice makes YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
