Then he decided to apply to medical school himself (he did dream of being a doctor when he was a kid tbf) and tried to tell me that I should wait for him to finish medical school because we couldn't both go at the same time and I was younger.

Another alternative, again assuming that OP is in it for the long haul, would be to change the nature of their bill paying structure.
