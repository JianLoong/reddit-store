We currently have two children and a third on the way. My oldest two (4f)(2m) are super excited to be having another sister. Weve been trying for a while and IVf was thankfully successful finally. We've kept my pregnancy from our families for about 4.5 months now due to our families not like my wife and I's not only lesbian marriage, but also our interracial marriage. Yesterday, we threw a party during which we announced our pregnancy. It was obvious that everyone was shocked and a few were not exactly happy but we didn't let it ruin the mood. About 20 minutes after things had settled and everyone congratulated us, my sister stands on top of our outside table and announces to everyone she is pregnant also. I didn't let it bother me, because I was happy for her, but I wished she had waited until another day. My wife was not happy with her but did not tell anyone that and we congratulated her. About 15 minutes later while taking to my sister alone, she tells me she LIED about the pregnancy, but that her and her husband were trying and wanted people to know now. Mind you she told everyone she IS 2 months pregnant. I instantly started yelling at her telling her that not only was she a liar but that she did it during the party that my wife and I threw to tell them about OUR pregnancy and how she was selfish and attention seeking. She and her husband left as she was crying. When my mom asked what happened i explained to her and my mom told me i should've just let her have her moment and left it alone. None of my family will talk to me, and even though my wife's family is on my side, they think i should've done it privately and keep telling my wife and i that i'm in the wrong.\n\nedit: i want to make it know since people are getting upset about the party..? we threw the party because this will be our first bio child. my son is adopted and my daughter is my wife's child from a previous marriage that i legally adopted as well.", "created_utc": 1676907216, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117a0hz/aita_for_screaming_at_my_sister_after_announcing/", "score": 2068, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You DID leave it alone. You only yelled at her because she lied about it, in an attempt to take the attention away. Now if she WAS actually pregnant and would've waited or talk to you about doing an announcement together I would say Y T A because there wouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with two pregnancies\nannouncements.

Your mother is enabling this bizarre and horrible behaviour.\n\nBut what concerns me is that your entire party were 'shocked' and some 'nor exactly happy.'  Your support network seems sadly lacking. I'd spend a bit of time wheedling out the ones who didn't look happy. You don't need them in your life.", "NTA. Nothing about this story leads me to believe anything other than your sister is an AH and a jealous one at that. \nCongratulations on your expanding family with your wife.", "NTA.

She needed to be taught a lesson.", "NTA. \n\nShe clearly couldn\u2019t tolerate you and your wife having a moment to celebrate your first bio child. Congrats by the way. \n\nNot only that but your family will have to now deal with when she eventually \u201closes\u201d her baby given she\u2019s not even pregnant. There\u2019s a reason people wait to announce to family and it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want the family to have to deal with a miscarriage.

I hope she gets some help because a stable, sane person does not act this way.", "You have two kids - why was anyone shocked? \n\nAnd why was anyone not shocked that a supposedly pregnant sister stood on a table.  \n\nThis makes no sense.", "NTA. Your sister is the attention-seeking AH here, and a liar as well. I assume this is not a one-off occurrence and that she has pulled stunts like this before, especially since your family wanted you to just \u2018let her have her moment\u2019. Your yelling was probably due to years of built-up frustration with this dynamic.\n\nCongratulations to you and your wife!", "NTA \r  \n\r  \nShe was being intentionally mean and was fishing for attention and a reaction from you. \r  \n\r\r  \nOf course in an ideal world we could always be collected and state our displeasure calmly, but your sister's actions were definitely out of line and your frustration was understandable.\r And knowing your families history of disrespecting your relationship it seems that their reaction to the situation is tainted by their bigotry.\r  \n\r\r  \nIf you want to be (overly) constructive about this, message your sister and explain how her behavior was hurtful, but that you are sorry about the screaming. \r  \n\r  \n\rAnyways good luck and strength dealing with your families and congratulations on the pregnancy!", "INFO: does your mother know your sister is not only a narcissist but a liar, too?\n\nI could see her believing your sister is pregnant and telling you to just let her have her moment, but if your Mom knew she was lying through her teeth and still told you that you were wrong, that would let you know exactly where you stand with your side of the family.", "NTA She lied.

It's just classless to announce a pregnancy at someone else's celebration. To outright lie about a pregnancy is even worse.

I'll never understand this type of drama.", "ESH. Your sister has some problems - I don\u2019t know what they are, but standing on a table at someone else\u2019s party to announce your pregnancy and lying about it is VERY strange. \n\nYou still shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her, plain and simple.

The only good thing about this is that the kids are (allegedly) 4 and 2, meaning they\u2019re hopefully too young to realize how excited OP is about finally having a biological child to the point that they threw a party just to announce it. 4.5 months pregnant and the favoritism is already showing\u2026\n\nRegardless, I\u2019m really struggling to believe it\u2019s real - OP\u2019s family doesn\u2019t really support her marriage, yet she still throws a party to announce her pregnancy and is surprised that not everyone is happy, the timeline and ages of the kids, crazy sister making it an obvious judgment, I saw in another comment that OP apparently initially said that the son was her wife\u2019s biological child meaning she couldn\u2019t even keep her story straight, and adding to that what you just pointed out.", "And the OP's edit says one is her wife's child from previous relationship but this comment says first two were adopted? Keep your story straight, OP. Something ain't right", "To be fair if my sibling lied about being two months pregnant in any context, I would probably yell \"WTF is wrong with you!\" whether there was a party or not. The fact that she did so intentionally to take attention away from OP and direct it at herself just adds icing to the cake, but isn't the core issue--the lie is.", "the question isn\u2019t AITA for having a party. I think the response was reasonable. It was already tacky to announce if it was real. Like proposing at wedding. But even then OP didn\u2019t say anything until she learned she faked it??? That\u2019s why the sister admitted it, because her first announcement didn\u2019t make OP flip out. This isn\u2019t just about social etiquette, it\u2019s about respect. I think it\u2019s more than attention seeking, considering OPs mention of racism and homophobia. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was a way of trying to snub OP\u2019s lesbian relationship and IVF with the announcement of a baby from a hetero relationship", "[removed]", "There it is right there. It is absolutely 1000% bigotry. It's fine for sister to *lie* about a pregnancy because of two likely things. Sister is in a heterosexual relationship AND is likely not in an interracial relationship. Those two things would make it ok to Mom for sis to lie because the unspoken part here is \"sisters pregnancy would be actually legitimate\". \n\nI have too many family members who think the same, and even for my very white heterosexual marriage, I've been told that if we adopt the kids arent \"really our kids\". My mother outright said she wouldnt treat adopted kids the same as \"real grandkids\". Some \"families\" can be rly rly effed up\n\nEdit to add judgement: NTA op. Your family, or at least your Mom for justifying it and your sis for doing it, are showing their true colors. People who do this kind of crap are despicable. When she inevitably announces the miscarriage is Mom going to admit then how awful sis is being, considering how many women go through multiple traumatic miscarriages?

Then to find out she highjacked your party with a lie I would have been livid.  She deserved to be publicly called out. Don\u2019t let your mother and family downplay this incident.  Your sister is either jealous or is the golden child and wanted to maintain that status. Your mother saying you \u201cshould\u2019ve just let her have her moment\u201d - what?! This wasn\u2019t her moment! It was your wife\u2019s and your moment. If your family doesn\u2019t stop, block them. You did nothing wrong.

I want to know what her plan was for when she wasn't actually pregnant and having a baby in 7 months.

It was your moment, she usurped it by lying about being pregnant.", "[removed]", "That fact that you family supports your sister LYING about being pregnant but doesn\u2019t really support you because of your lesbian/interracial marriage says a LOT! \n\nWhy do you even associate with them?? They all suck! \n\nAbsolutely NTA", "NTA. She picked YOUR pregnancy announcement party to announce a FAKE pregnancy??  Yeah...no.", "It's not that you were TA, but I'll say I think you didn't have to do anything. How desperate and sad your sister is. First to tell the lie, then to tell you the truth right after and still want to perpetuate her lie. In that moment, I think I would have just shook my head and walked away. None of that is to say your family is even close to right. I'm glad you've got good loving people in your wife's family. Focus on them.", "NTA. How was any of that meant to be \"her moment\"? It was a party thrown by you and your wife, to announce YOUR pregnancy. Does your sister have a history of trying to make everything about her? Does your mom and everyone else consistently take her side? \n\nAlso, how long was she planning to keep the lie going? If she kept this up for months and people started to ask questions it all would have blown up in her face anyway. Unless she's the sick kind of person who would fake a miscarriage for the sympathy, most likely when you and your wife announce the gender.\n\nFor the sake of your own mental health, keep your distance from her.
