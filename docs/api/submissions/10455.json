We currently have two children and a third on the way. My oldest two (4f)(2m) are super excited to be having another sister. Weve been trying for a while and IVf was thankfully successful finally. We've kept my pregnancy from our families for about 4.5 months now due to our families not like my wife and I's not only lesbian marriage, but also our interracial marriage. Yesterday, we threw a party during which we announced our pregnancy. It was obvious that everyone was shocked and a few were not exactly happy but we didn't let it ruin the mood. About 20 minutes after things had settled and everyone congratulated us, my sister stands on top of our outside table and announces to everyone she is pregnant also. I didn't let it bother me, because I was happy for her, but I wished she had waited until another day. My wife was not happy with her but did not tell anyone that and we congratulated her. About 15 minutes later while taking to my sister alone, she tells me she LIED about the pregnancy, but that her and her husband were trying and wanted people to know now. Mind you she told everyone she IS 2 months pregnant. I instantly started yelling at her telling her that not only was she a liar but that she did it during the party that my wife and I threw to tell them about OUR pregnancy and how she was selfish and attention seeking. She and her husband left as she was crying. When my mom asked what happened i explained to her and my mom told me i should've just let her have her moment and left it alone. None of my family will talk to me, and even though my wife's family is on my side, they think i should've done it privately and keep telling my wife and i that i'm in the wrong.\n\nedit: i want to make it know since people are getting upset about the party..? we threw the party because this will be our first bio child. my son is adopted and my daughter is my wife's child from a previous marriage that i legally adopted as well.", "created_utc": 1676907216, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117a0hz/aita_for_screaming_at_my_sister_after_announcing/", "score": 418, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You DID leave it alone. You only yelled at her because she lied about it, in an attempt to take the attention away. Now if she WAS actually pregnant and would've waited or talk to you about doing an announcement together I would say Y T A because there wouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with two pregnancies\nannouncements.

Your mother is enabling this bizarre and horrible behaviour.\n\nBut what concerns me is that your entire party were 'shocked' and some 'nor exactly happy.'  Your support network seems sadly lacking. I'd spend a bit of time wheedling out the ones who didn't look happy. You don't need them in your life.", "NTA. Nothing about this story leads me to believe anything other than your sister is an AH and a jealous one at that. \nCongratulations on your expanding family with your wife.", "NTA.

It was selfish and attention seeking after all.", "NTA what your sister did was shitty enough if she was telling the truth. The fact that she was lying just makes it worse, and good for you calling out the lying liar on her lies. She needed to be taught a lesson.", "NTA. \n\nShe clearly couldn\u2019t tolerate you and your wife having a moment to celebrate your first bio child. Congrats by the way. \n\nNot only that but your family will have to now deal with when she eventually \u201closes\u201d her baby given she\u2019s not even pregnant. There\u2019s a reason people wait to announce to family and it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want the family to have to deal with a miscarriage.

I hope she gets some help because a stable, sane person does not act this way.", "You have two kids - why was anyone shocked? \n\nAnd why was anyone not shocked that a supposedly pregnant sister stood on a table.  \n\nThis makes no sense.", "NTA. Your sister is the attention-seeking AH here, and a liar as well. I assume this is not a one-off occurrence and that she has pulled stunts like this before, especially since your family wanted you to just \u2018let her have her moment\u2019. Your yelling was probably due to years of built-up frustration with this dynamic.\n\nCongratulations to you and your wife!", "NTA \r  \n\r  \nShe was being intentionally mean and was fishing for attention and a reaction from you. \r  \n\r\r  \nOf course in an ideal world we could always be collected and state our displeasure calmly, but your sister's actions were definitely out of line and your frustration was understandable.\r And knowing your families history of disrespecting your relationship it seems that their reaction to the situation is tainted by their bigotry.\r  \n\r\r  \nIf you want to be (overly) constructive about this, message your sister and explain how her behavior was hurtful, but that you are sorry about the screaming. \r  \n\r  \n\rAnyways good luck and strength dealing with your families and congratulations on the pregnancy!", "INFO: does your mother know your sister is not only a narcissist but a liar, too?\n\nI could see her believing your sister is pregnant and telling you to just let her have her moment, but if your Mom knew she was lying through her teeth and still told you that you were wrong, that would let you know exactly where you stand with your side of the family.", "NTA She lied.

Not quite sure why she's playing victim here...", "NTA and time to start *greatly* reducing the contact you have with your asshole family members.", "NTA but your sister seriously needs some therapy because she has some massive issues she needs to deal with.", "NTA. It's just classless to announce a pregnancy at someone else's celebration. To outright lie about a pregnancy is even worse.

I'll never understand this type of drama.", "ESH. Your sister has some problems - I don\u2019t know what they are, but standing on a table at someone else\u2019s party to announce your pregnancy and lying about it is VERY strange. \n\nYou still shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her, plain and simple.

Op NTA.", "How does your wife have a 4 year old from a previous marriage if you\u2019ve been together 6?", "Color me ignorant than, I thought social gatherings were for socializing\n\nETA- I am not denying my ignorance, I very seldom attend events at all.", "If she\u2019s an adult and ready then why not. Didn\u2019t realize small brain action was going on here", "Ya they really buried the lede there. Maybe there's another reason the family isn't thrilled about their relationship?", "OPs sister is the worst but this whole set up is nonsense.  The grandparents are not supportive of the family - couple or adoptive children - so they have a party to announce a pregnancy\u2026 ummm no.  \n\nThen sister - if this is real - stands on a table to announce pregnancy and no one says \u2018did you just stand on a table to announce a pregnancy?\u2019  Also no.  \n\nThen sister says it\u2019s fake immediately - really? - and OP screams.  Screamed being OPs word choice.  Bc the pregnancy being fake is the biggest problem here?  \n\nThe kids definitely do not suck. E S H was not fair.", "You're out on a limb here. There is no comparison between having a party to make a family announcement and hijacking a party to make a family announcement. The former is an accepted, celebratory practice; the latter, at best, lacks couth.", "If you acknowledge your ignorance of these types of gatherings and their etiquette, it's rather bold (bordering on rude AF) of you to call OP and her partner hypocrites for creating a party to celebrate their news.", "Did you mean troll mecca?", "Yes it does. Cause she is a attention seeker and it was OP and OP'S wife moments.", "Of course a lie matters!", "She can do whatever she wants, but it's very weird to think other people should care that you're getting nutted in.", "Did you read the post? She isn\u2019t pregnant and lied saying she was to steal the spotlight. Seems like you have some small brain action going on.", "Yeah, this has got too many bingo points", "Oh I agree. Throwing the party was either a way to say \u201cfuck you\u201d to their family or it was a desperate and failed attempt to get the family\u2019s support. Inviting people who don\u2019t support your relationship or adopted kids\u2019 existence to a party is doing a disservice to OP\u2019s partner as well as to OP\u2019s kids, including the unborn one. That family doesn\u2019t deserve to be a part of the festivities, and hopefully OP learned that finally, if, like you said, it is even true.", "I'm sorry please explain.  Say my cousin were pregnant, she would have to throw party specifically to tell us? She couldn't just tell us when I saw her next, regardless of what party?", "You can go with rude, I'm feeling saucy today.", "Everybody\u2019s been one in there life", "Lies don\u2019t matter. I\u2019d rather lie to make someone feel like an ass then look like one", "If I\u2019m nutting in my girl, I want our family and friends to know we\u2019re trying for a baby. Nobody goes \u201cyeah I\u2019m being nutted in\u201d", "No, she just lied that she was already pregnant.", "How does your wife have a 4yo from a previous marriage if you've been together for 6 years? \ud83e\udd14", "It could be inferred that you didn't have any sort of celebration for the non-bio kids until you mentioned it in the comments, & I can certainly see how that might upset people who make that assumption, js.\n\nCongratulations on expanding your beautiful family!\n\nNTA"]}
