We currently have two children and a third on the way. My oldest two (4f)(2m) are super excited to be having another sister. Weve been trying for a while and IVf was thankfully successful finally. We've kept my pregnancy from our families for about 4.5 months now due to our families not like my wife and I's not only lesbian marriage, but also our interracial marriage. Yesterday, we threw a party during which we announced our pregnancy. It was obvious that everyone was shocked and a few were not exactly happy but we didn't let it ruin the mood. About 20 minutes after things had settled and everyone congratulated us, my sister stands on top of our outside table and announces to everyone she is pregnant also. I didn't let it bother me, because I was happy for her, but I wished she had waited until another day. My wife was not happy with her but did not tell anyone that and we congratulated her. About 15 minutes later while taking to my sister alone, she tells me she LIED about the pregnancy, but that her and her husband were trying and wanted people to know now. Mind you she told everyone she IS 2 months pregnant. I instantly started yelling at her telling her that not only was she a liar but that she did it during the party that my wife and I threw to tell them about OUR pregnancy and how she was selfish and attention seeking. She and her husband left as she was crying. When my mom asked what happened i explained to her and my mom told me i should've just let her have her moment and left it alone. None of my family will talk to me, and even though my wife's family is on my side, they think i should've done it privately and keep telling my wife and i that i'm in the wrong.\n\nedit: i want to make it know since people are getting upset about the party..? we threw the party because this will be our first bio child. my son is adopted and my daughter is my wife's child from a previous marriage that i legally adopted as well.", "created_utc": 1676907216, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117a0hz/aita_for_screaming_at_my_sister_after_announcing/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is she going to lie again and say she miscarried? If she gets pregnant in a few months is she going to pretend the baby was born early? Why would your mother condone such behavior? This is horrible", "NTA. Even if she was pregnant, what she did would've been uncouth. Since she wasn't, she was just being an asshole. There's no good faith explanation for doing that.", "No way. NTA. Your sister is a psycho and your family are all enablers. Fuck these people, jeeze.", "NTA.\n\nEven if she was pregnant, what she did was shitty. Obviously she wanted to take the attention away from you and your wife\n\n>About 15 minutes later while taking to my sister alone, she tells me she LIED about the pregnancy, but her snd her husband were trying and wanted people to know\n\nThis right here IS attention seeking. I don\u2019t blame you for yelling at your sister because what she did was wrong\n\n>My mom told me I should\u2019ve just let her have her moment and left it alone\n\nHere's the thing: you did. You DID leave it alone. You only yelled at her because she lied about it, in an attempt to take the attention away. Now if she WAS actually pregnant and would've waited or talk to you about doing an announcement together I would say Y T A because there wouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with two pregnancies\nannouncements. However, clearly she did this just for attention and was envious of the attention you was getting", "NTA- she did lie and was absolutely trying to steal the attention away from your announcement. Your mother is doing her no favours by allowing her \u201cto have her moment\u201d instead of holding her accountable for behaviour.", "NTA. Your sister has major issues and lied for attention. Your mother is enabling this bizarre and horrible behaviour.\n\nBut what concerns me is that your entire party were 'shocked' and some 'nor exactly happy.'  Your support network seems sadly lacking. I'd spend a bit of time wheedling out the ones who didn't look happy. You don't need them in your life.", "NTA. Nothing about this story leads me to believe anything other than your sister is an AH and a jealous one at that. \nCongratulations on your expanding family with your wife.", "NTA. Your sister\u2026 needs to get some help. What she did isn\u2019t normal. And your mom and other family members\u2026 \u201clet her have her moment\u201d?!?! \u201cHEY EVERYONE I\u2019M THE KING OF ENGLAND!\u201d NOW GIVE ME MY MOMENT!", "NTA - Maybe the approach was wrong but think you maybe entitled to it in this instance. It was selfish and attention seeking after all.", "NTA what your sister did was shitty enough if she was telling the truth. The fact that she was lying just makes it worse, and good for you calling out the lying liar on her lies. She needed to be taught a lesson.", "NTA. \n\nShe clearly couldn\u2019t tolerate you and your wife having a moment to celebrate your first bio child. Congrats by the way. \n\nNot only that but your family will have to now deal with when she eventually \u201closes\u201d her baby given she\u2019s not even pregnant. There\u2019s a reason people wait to announce to family and it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want the family to have to deal with a miscarriage. So that\u2019s a shit move on her part. \n\nI don\u2019t know why she couldn\u2019t just be happy for you and you\u2019re in the right for confronting her. You and your wife deserve better.", "NTA - why your family seemed to think this behaviour from your sister is acceptable when it's a blatant LIE seems weird. I'm sorry to say but those particular relatives seem like TA's and I would strongly recommend focusing on your wife and your kids as the only ones who matter.\n\nWishing you all the best with your new offspring", "Let your family continue to not talk to you\n\nThat way you can enjoy the pregnancy without any BS distractions from them.\n\nYour sister and your parents owe you an apology and until you get it, you should keep them at arms length\n\nNTA", "I can definitely understand that your reaction was perhaps more \"heat of the moment\", but regardless, NTA.\n\nNot only did she try to take the limelight away from you and your wife at a party YOU planned, but she also lied about it. The only person who is in the wrong here is your sister. I hope she gets some help because a stable, sane person does not act this way.", "You have two kids - why was anyone shocked? \n\nAnd why was anyone not shocked that a supposedly pregnant sister stood on a table.  \n\nThis makes no sense.", "NTA. Your sister is the attention-seeking AH here, and a liar as well. I assume this is not a one-off occurrence and that she has pulled stunts like this before, especially since your family wanted you to just \u2018let her have her moment\u2019. Your yelling was probably due to years of built-up frustration with this dynamic.\n\nCongratulations to you and your wife!", "NTA \r  \n\r  \nShe was being intentionally mean and was fishing for attention and a reaction from you. \r  \n\r\r  \nOf course in an ideal world we could always be collected and state our displeasure calmly, but your sister's actions were definitely out of line and your frustration was understandable.\r And knowing your families history of disrespecting your relationship it seems that their reaction to the situation is tainted by their bigotry.\r  \n\r\r  \nIf you want to be (overly) constructive about this, message your sister and explain how her behavior was hurtful, but that you are sorry about the screaming. \r  \n\r  \n\rAnyways good luck and strength dealing with your families and congratulations on the pregnancy!", "INFO: does your mother know your sister is not only a narcissist but a liar, too?\n\nI could see her believing your sister is pregnant and telling you to just let her have her moment, but if your Mom knew she was lying through her teeth and still told you that you were wrong, that would let you know exactly where you stand with your side of the family.", "NTA She lied. You hosted to share the wonderful news and it wasn't appropriate of her to make a grand stand and announce something like that, much less a lie. Not quite sure why she's playing victim here...", "NTA and time to start *greatly* reducing the contact you have with your asshole family members.", "NTA but your sister seriously needs some therapy because she has some massive issues she needs to deal with.", "NTA. It's just classless to announce a pregnancy at someone else's celebration. To outright lie about a pregnancy is even worse. What will your sister do next, claim she miscarried if no pregnancy happens? Then she gets more attention and undeserved sympathy. Congratulations to you, your wife, and your children. Shame you have such a crappy family.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyour sister is an AH .. why do you still allow her to be in your life? And: Your family are AHs, have a lot less contact wirth your mom and all the others. And STOP inviting your AH sister - let her have \"her moments\" somewhere else.", "NTA,  but why are you inviting your family to a party when your post states that neither your families like your interracial lesbian relationship.  Why would you want to celebrate with people who don't even support your relationship? Based on the that information your sister behavior and families reaction aren't that surprising.", "Women have been having babies since the beginning of time.  I'll never understand this type of drama.", "ESH. Your sister has some problems - I don\u2019t know what they are, but standing on a table at someone else\u2019s party to announce your pregnancy and lying about it is VERY strange. \n\nYou still shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her, plain and simple. Not only is it better to be the bigger person, but now you have a mess to clean up instead of you sister needing to figure out how she unwinds the false announcement.", "ESH-\n\n>I instantly started yelling at her telling her that not only was she a liar but that she did it during the party that my wife and I threw to tell them about OUR pregnancy and how she was selfish and attention seeking.\n\n\"Attention seeking\" is a bold thing to call someone at a party thrown for something a text could accomplish.

Also, I waited so long because I wasn't even sure If I was even keeping it as I was scared for my health as my first made my liver disease worse. I wanted to decide I ended up keeping it and wanted to see a OB first but finding one took a long time as either not taking In or they closed.\n\nAnyways, my husband ended up telling his sister during the wedding party but not like in a announcement just to her while everyone partied so he didn't scream oh hey everyone my wife pregnant!

But ooph sounds like your sister is either vengeful and/or really upset with perhaps a difficulty of getting pregnant. Which would suck, it\u2019s not fair it\u2019s hard for some- but letting her tell lies would not aid any cause. If she is lying just to get attention that is just entirely messed up.\n\nI am wondering why you would invite people who do not really support your marriage for such an intimate moment, but that\u2019s not really the point of this thread.", "NTA.
