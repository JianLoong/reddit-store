But you are on a 100-150 day hike.  On about day 80 this will become the most hilarious story ever.  Don\u2019t worry about it.  You are free", "NTA I have no idea why someone would just think, \"backpacking, no big deal!\" let alone misrepresent their experience and ability. Especially someone who has a known impairment that could be a factor when hiking a long distance. There are so many other ways she could support you, had she taken a day to research the PCT, without inviting herself along.", "NTA whatsoever. Go enjoy your hike. Zoe didn't know what she was doing, and what's worse, she misled you about her experience, concealed an injury that made hiking difficult, and was in general a load on you. \n\nShe wasn't doing you a favor at all. The nerve of some people. She was a burden, not a help.", "So are you writing this from the trail?  Have a great, fun, safe trip!  NTA.  Zoe should not have said she had experience when she didn't.  I'm not sure what she means by you weren't thinking of her, like did she mean you should have offered to keep carrying her stuff? 'Cause that's ridiculous.  She claimed to be an experienced hiker so you wouldn't expect you'd need to think about her!", "NTA. Those kind of hikes can be dangerous and she just flippantly lied about having participated in them before. Also. Vet people next time", "NTA.\n\nThis is Little Purple Pig level stuff if you caught that fun on the sub.\n\nLucky you guys had water before the 20 mile mark...", "NTA - at all! It is ridiculously selfish and dangerous for her to have lied about being able to complete such a trip. Not only does it endanger herself, but it puts you at risk too.  It was incredibly inconsiderate on her part. You went above and beyond trying to help her at any point. \n\nDo not think twice about telling her she should get a ride.", "NTA. I\u2019ve not reached backpacking level yet and just by watching YouTube videos, I\u2019ve already learned what she pulled was serious novice bs. Planning a trip like yours is a huge undertaking and you did more than enough to accommodate her till drop off. She should be grateful you didn\u2019t toss that extra weight down a ravine.", "NTA - people who haven\u2019t been backpacking truly have no idea. You can have a ton of outdoor experience but hauling everything on your back, being mindful of balancing weight and needs, is a whole other thing. This chick had no flipping clue the amount of prep work that goes into planning a through hike. My husband is section hiking the AT and his annual prep for that is enough. \n\nI agree with the poster who said this will turn into a funny memory along the trail. Who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll be inspired to repair the friendship. It was awfully kind of her to buy a whole bunch of unnecessary gear to support you. She was probably embarrassed and you were emotionally raw too. Give it time", "NTA, she's an idiot. If you weren't as experienced and told her to stop, she could have gotten herself into serious trouble.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She REALLY wanted to hike this intense hike, asked me if I wanted to come, I said \"no thank you\" because I am well aware of my athletic ability and I wouldn't want to add another burden to my friend for the sake of not getting FOMO. You have stated that this was your dream, she knew how important it was, so the least she could have done is assess whether she'd be able to handle it, or AT LEAST play it safe = not go/be prepared\nYou didn't force her to go.
