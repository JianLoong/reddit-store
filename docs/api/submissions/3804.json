So a little background:\n\nI (28M) am a writer. I mostly write erotica and while I don't make a ton of money doing it I make enough to get by and I enjoy my work. My immediate family knows about this and is fine with it, other than my mother. While mom is supportive of me and is glad I enjoy my work, she is embarrassed by it and won't tell her friends or family what I do. If anybody asks I just say I am a writer, but if mom is around she normally jumps into the conversation and blows it off like it's not a serious thing. I normally just let it go though as its not a big deal to me and I don't want to embarrass my mother.\n\nSo anyways, thanksgiving comes around and I head home for our annual dinner. The whole family is there and everybody is having a good time. My mother manages to change the topic whenever someone asks about what I'm doing, which was annoying but I could live with it. Things were going well until grandma asks me what I'm doing for work. Mom tries to change the subject again but Grandma is not swayed, her gaze stayed directed at me. Mom then interjects and tells everyone that I'm working at Denny's. My brother and I shared a quick glance of confusion. Grandma gets excited as her and Grandpa go to Dennys at least three times a week (which is really confusing why mom would pick Dennys in the first place to choose in her lie, but whatever.)\n\nSo grandma starts asking questions about my \"new job.\" I never got the chance to answer any of them as mom would answer them for me. Finally I had had enough and said loudly \"I don't fucking work at Dennys, I'm a fucking writer.\" (I do feel bad about swearing in front of my grandparents, but I was just pissed off.) My mom looked horrified and started crying while the rest of the family shared looks of confusion with each other.\n\nMy grandfather, not phased by any of this, asks me what I write, as he mows down on turkey (the only one left eating at this point.) As I explain to him that write erotic/sex stories, my mom continues to ball her eyes out and runs out of the room crying. Grandpa seems intrigued with my line of wok and ask many questions, we ended up having a good conversation. The rest of the family seemed to settle down and continue eating, nobody but mom seemed upset. My mom did end up coming back to the room to clean up, but would not speak with anyone the rest of the night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister says I'm the asshole for making a scene and making my mother seem like a liar in front of everybody. My brother thought the whole thing was kind of funny and agrees with me, other than using the f-bomb in front of grandma which I do feel bad about. I haven't spoke to my mother since as I'm not sure what to say, she is a good mother and I do love her.
