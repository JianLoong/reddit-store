Again I ask, because this is like elementary schools reading comprehension, what are you smoking? No lie detected.\n\nI'm shocked that no one here has the common sense to assume jumping a fence is the first thing that happened. Probably happens all the time. You guys think he pulled out lock picks or something? Use your common sense.", "I have an extremely aggressive dog. If they had hopped the fence or even entered my yard without letting me know to bring my dog in, they could have been attacked. I don't understand why workers, landscapers, etc, are not more concerned about things like this. My landscapers always come at different times during the week and once my dog almost got one of them... yet they still don't let me know when they're coming. I have to listen for their machines to know if they decide to show up and panic to make sure my dog is in. Unfortunately, only one of them speaks English and I don't know if he's relaying my concerns to the rest because they just keep doing it.\n\nAnyway, sorry for going off on a tangent.\n\nBeing concerned about people, even ppl hired to work, coming into your yard should be a normal thing to do.\n\nNTA", "YTA.  The workers had explicit permission from your husband to do the work they were contracted to do so long as they did not bother him.  You were the one who made the assumption that it was done, and ended up being wrong.  The fact that your husband made their permission contingent on them literally not bothering him means you have virtually no leg to stand on, they ultimately acted as they were instructed.\n\nYou just don't have a good counterargument here.  If you had actually decided to call the police over them \"trespassing\", the fact that they had a literal contract to repair your siding is just way, way stronger than your assertion that they jumped the fence to do it, particularly due to the implicit permission by virtue of what your husband had previously said, and you may have ended up with a ticket.  You can be annoyed, but be annoyed at the workers' supervisors for the workers' approach, not the workers themselves.  Complain to the firm(but ultimately, complain at your husband).", ">My husband was here and told them he'd be going to bed as he works nights and to continue as long as they weren't noisy about it. \n\nIt seems like the workers were trying hard to be respectful of your husband's request. Knocking/ringing the doorbell would have been noise that could have woken your husband and thus was directly contrary to the directions their employer gave them. Also, just inconsiderate since he said he was sleeping for work.\n\nI guess I don't understand what you're upset about? That they were in your yard doing their jobs like you paid them to do? That they didn't bother you to unlock the gate when they were specifically told not to? \n\nJumping the fence to unlock it for the other works is also considerate beacuse it means that they didn't damage anything to get in. They didn't \"break in\". They found a way to do what they were told even though that was made more difficult by you locking the gate. I understand you weren't trying to make their jobs more difficult, it was a misunderstanding, but you did and they were considerate and diligent workers despite that. They didn't bother you when you made things harder for them beacuse they'd been told not to.", ">It was clear that I was home. Knocking on the door would not have woken him up.\n\nThese are things you knew, they are not things the workers knew. You assume they knew you were home beacuse:\n\n> he could see a second vehicle was in the driveway now, so I was obviously home. \n\nI guess this is news to you, but some people go places without their car. It is not \"obvious\" that you are home when your car is in the driveway. So, for example I drive my car home from work, park it, and then sometimes I walk places. I walk to the grocery store, to the park with the kids, to a neighbor's home (that can be a very short walk). My kid's have an activity one day a week in walking distance. I pick them up from school/daycare by car, park it at home, and then we walk. Also, my older kid's school is in walking distance as well and sometimes there are evening or after school events and the parking is always full so we walk to those. I also actually go for these things called walks, where I just leave the house without my car for fresh air and exercise. People also walk dogs, babies, go for jogs, take their kids out to use scooters or bikes, etc. And I bike sometimes too. I know another couple that bikes a lot and a car in their driveway does not mean they are home at all. A car in my dad's driveway does not mean he is home despite him living alone and being nearly 70, either. Etc. \n\nNow let's move on to knocking would not wake your husband. Again, that depends. Remember, there is no guarantee you are home as you are not in fact glued to the hood of your care. Some people sleep more lightly then others. Some people have pets that make noise when you knock. Some people have loud doorbells. I admit that if they knew you didn't have any pets it seems unlikely they'd wake your husband, but since they were expressly told not to wake him so he could sleep for work it's just considerate of them not to risk it. When your boss asks you to be quiet not to wake them it's generally smart to not try and guess how much noise will wake them and just leave them alone."]}
