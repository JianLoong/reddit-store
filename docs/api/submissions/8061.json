{"id": 8061, "submission_id": "10j9xa2", "title": "AITA for telling my Mom she wont be allowed to attend my graduation and my mayor life events in the future", "selftext": "AITA for telling my mom she won\u2019t be invited to my graduation ceremony and every other big life event in the future?\n\nI (F/23) will be graduating university this year and my whole family is just really excited about it (and they have always been a huge support for me, especially my mom). Therefore I really want most of them to be there. \n\nThe issue is mainly with my stepdad. \nMy parents divorced when I was about five years old and my mom remarried two years later (my dad\u2018s childhood best friend). So my parents were not always on best terms.\n\nMy childhood was kinda bad due to their whole dispute and my stepdad and I always had a strained relationship. The older I got the worse it got. It really took a toll on my mental health and whenever my therapist suggested something to improve my mental health he straight up refused to do it or to even change his ways in the slightest. My mom fought a lot with him due to that for some time but she gave up trying and stayed with him (sometimes just for the sake of my younger half-brother, whom I dearly love and cherish). \nBut having my mom disregard my health for my brother\u2019s was still hard to deal with in my early teenage years.\n\nA few examples: \n\n- stepdad told me (when I was about 10/11) that no one would care about my day and that I should simply stop talking about it cause it was simply annoying to him. \n\n- when I was on the verge of mentally breaking completely my therapist suggested a pet as an emotional support. My stepdad hates pets so he just refused even though he was told that I would only get worse without a living being to emotionally support me\n\n- when I misbehaved as a child he didn\u2019t communicate with me but showed me index cards with his rules. When I still didn\u2019t follow through with them I was not allowed to eat and had to sit on the stairs without talking or anything \nmy younger brother (his son) never had or has to follow through with any rules and misbehaves a lot (no consequences tho)\n\n- overall he didn\u2019t and still does not communicate with me. He did not talk to me for the 12 years I lived with them. He did not treat me like a family member or even a family friend \n\nThere were a few smaller things, too, but he\u2019s overall not the nicest person.\n\nDue to my mom always demanding for him to come to all my mayor life events my dad missed out on a lot of them (even though I want him to be there every step of the way). \nShe straight up refuses to go without him because my dad is allowed to bring his wife and she doesn\u2019t want to show up alone. I kinda get where she is coming from but I don\u2019t want to deal with my unresolved feelings and issues on my special occasions. Therefore I told her that if she doesn\u2019t want to attend without him she can simply stay away and if she shows up with him she will be uninvited from every single future event.\n\nA few of my family members (mainly my mom\u2019s/stepdad\u2019s side) told me that I am overreacting and being a brat and I should just let him come. This makes me feel insecure about my decision. So AITA?\n\nEdit: \nBecause a lot of people seem to have a strong dislike for my mom I wanted to say some things:\n\nShe very much knows what happened to me as a child but she herself was badly abused by her own parents and had to basically raise herself. My dad physically and mentally mistreated her when they were younger and long before I was born (but he never treated me badly). She still tried and whenever she realized what happened she tried to give me as much attention as possible to kinda cancel out his neglect.\n\nShe is a good person, who was mistreated horribly in her life and who was just not fit to be a mother when I was young. I am by no means saying that I condone what she allowed to happen. She\u2019s just broken and sometimes broken people tend to do the same to others.\n\nEdit 2:\nMy parents are on speaking terms and they both have realized that they treated each other badly. I don\u2019t know much about their past relationship but they both turned fights physical sometimes. They both were not good for each other. I love them both dearly but I\u2019ve grown enough to realize that both were at fault and both failed me when I was a child. \n\nMy dad and even more my stepmom and their families tried their best to support me as soon as they found out about what happened at my mom\u2019s place. But I\u2019ve kept those things to myself most of the time because I did thing that it was normal behavior. I grew up like this ever since I was six.

She's still trying to force you to tolerate your abuser in your life, and still interfering with your efforts to recover. Do not downplay her responsibility in all of this. **Manipulation is also abuse.**  She's trying to have her cake (her abusive husband) and eat it too (a healthy relationship with her abused daughter), but these things are diametrically opposed. She can't have both, unless you \"break\" like her and simply tolerate the abuse. **That's what she's trying to do -- break you, too.** So that her life can be easier, at your expense.

I loved my own now-deceased mom too, though she was horrible (physically and emotionally abusive) to me right up until she died. Reaching a place from which I could move forward also meant that I had to see what she did to me for what it really was. My mom also claimed that 'she tried.' She claimed to regret abusing me, and showed me a little extra affection now and again to \"make up for\" the bad times -- but all of that was part of her particular cycle of abuse. She would say or do something awful, I'd call her on it or do something to mitigate the situation, she'd apologize and cry and say she tried... and then she'd start gaslighting me on what actually happened. Lying to our family about why I was angry, and sending them to harass me. Continuing to do the same old shit. Maybe she even believed she meant the words in the moment when she said them... but **it was a lie. She did not really regret abusing me.

Stop making excuses for your mom, she had one job, to protect you and she failed. Shes lucky you still talk to her. \nI was raised by a alcoholic and abusive mother who had mental issues. I broke off contact with her a number of times due to her behaviour and some things she said about my very young grand children. \nTake care of yourself and don't let anyone pressure you into anything.", "NTA\n\nI think you should take the time to write down a biography of what happened, dates, times, what happened and the consequences of those actions.  And your reasons for cutting her out of your life.  Make several copies, and put them in sealed envelopes.  \n\nNow if you ever get married and she wants to come, tell her that it is her alone and not her husband.  Eventually she is going to ask why, and then send her a sealed envelope and put down this is the reason why.  \n\nSame thing for if you ever have a child, do not invite her in, as she will bring her husband along and that is a whole other drama you do not want.  I would say do not inform her of if you do get pregnant, you do not need the stress in your life.\n\nOne day, if you ever have a child, that child may ask about your mother, and what all happened, and why he or she never gets to visit and other questions.  Tell them to ask when they are about 16 yo, and when the ask, then ask the child this:  Are you sure you want to know?  That once you hear, you will not be unable to hear it, that once you see, you can not unsee it and once you know, you can not unknow it.  And then hand them the envelope and let them read for themselves what all you went through while growing up.  That way the choice would be left in the hands of the child only.", "Strong NTA. Maybe tell mom she is welcome but stepdad is not? If she will only be there if he is welcome then she made her choice.\nDefinitely NTA but make sure you cut the right person out of your life. If she doesn't take this last opportunity to see how strongly you feel and how much his actions have had an impact on you to make you feel THIS strongly, then she is the one making that choice, nor you cutting her out", "NTA. Your stepdad abused you throughout your childhood. Your mom may have had reasons for why she allowed it to happen, but that doesn't (a) make it any less terrible what he did or (b) get her off the hook for still being willing to take his side in any way whatsoever. She should be grateful that you have any relationship at all with her after her failure to protect you from this monster", "NTA\n\nThey abused you. Your mother allowing your stepfather to abuse you, was in itself abuse.\n\nI understand that your mother had a hard life. That does not excuse anything or absolve her. That her reference point for how to treat people, including your own children, was so far from what is actually acceptable, is not her fault, but it was and is 100% her responsibility. \n\nDo not allow your stepfather to ever see you again. And personally, I would cut contact with your mother as well, but if you're not ready to do that, then you need to make absolutely clear that you will have absolutely zero contact with her husband, and if she doesn't respect that, then she needs to go as well. It sounds like she doesn't respect it though, so, I don't know there's much hope.", "NTA. However, if the issue lies with your step dad not your mom, You should have said she is welcome to come only if she doesn't bring him.", "Not allowing a child to eat....is physical abuse. Depending on how Lon they were forced to sit on steps- is physical abuse. This young woman does not want her mom to bring her ABUSER to life events.  She is NTA.", "If mom had custody- he may not have been allowed to know or come. NOW of course OP is an adult and can make that call.  But when a mnor- that may not have been the case.  Also the OP may have had \" consequences\" from step dad if she did invite dad- like not eating and being isolated on the steps for hours (FYI isolation is a SEVER punishment, and one that gets challenged legally all the time because of the significant negative impact)", "Geez! You deserve the Nobel big sister of the year award. Like I have tears streaming down my face. I will gladly come to your TedTalk *How Not To Be Jealous*. That was beautiful.", "But you are not even saying that anymore- you are not saying divorce and leave.  You are saying LEAVE HIM AT HOME.  And your mom- for all you empathize with her trauma, is still choosing to further traumatize YOU, rather than inconvenient herself. I understand why you empathize with mom- but mom has never made that effort for you- and you deserve AT least to not be constantly exposed to a man that physically abused you (not eating and sitting on stairs for long periods is considered, but CPS, PHYSICAL abuse)", "I'd hand her an index card next time either explaining that this is your house and they will follow your rules while they are there or basically throw back in her face how she won't go to events alone and that she should let the past be the past", "Your mom is wrong.", "The ABUSER and their ENABLER do not get to decide when the ABUSED is \"over it. Your mom wants to just move forward.  That is fine- he can do so by attending the events SOLO, without your abuser at her side.  Or SHE can \"let it go\", and not come.", "Your mom is enabling his abuse, and his past abuse explains but does not excuse that.", "I have a mother like that. I am a bit older than you, so I will share what I have learned. Whenever someone says to let the past rest, it is because that past makes them feel awful or shows they did something bad. She is ashamed of the past, but it made you who you are, so embrace it. I don't mean be a victim to it, I mean, acknowledge it happened and learn how to not parent from it.\n\nI always say that my parents taught me the valuable lesson of how to NOT parent. You hold that asshole to account using his own methods. You don't invite that asshole to any events because I am certain his rule is that he goes or your mother doesn't because he wants to see you uncomfortable.  If your mother chooses to support him, you can not change that, but do t make excuses for her either. You will only continue to enable her bad behavior. Your step-dad was probably mistreating you because you were not his child. Continue therapy and learn that you deserved the same treatment that your brother did.  Good luck and be well.\n\nPS - tag your stepfather to this if you ever feel the need to be petty so he knows he is shit and we all believe him to be shit.", "Thanks, I was getting confused.", "She's totally wrong too. OP is not this way because she left OP's father, she's this way because she stayed with OP's stepfather.", "This might be why she hasn\u2019t left her husband yet. I\u2019m not excusing, I\u2019m just saying that she saw how he could be towards you (and her, I\u2019m willing to bet there\u2019s abuse towards her), and in her mind she may have thought that if she had to leave her son alone with him, who\u2019s to say he wouldn\u2019t be abusive to him? However, by doing that, she put you in his danger daily. She allowed you to be abused. She is still complicit, no matter her reasoning. And, even worse, she\u2019s minimizing your needs and feelings to justify her decisions. Her husband might be controlling this situation by saying she can\u2019t go for you unless he\u2019s there. At the crux of this, she needs to take accountability. She may never. Being abused and also being the abuser (by enabling) is very complex.  \n\nYou: you need to start seeing the forest for the trees. Your mother was the best parent you grew up with between her and your stepdad. The bar was really pathetically fucking low. But, that\u2019s why you have such a strong alliance and feeling of loyalty to her. You deserve more. As a daughter of an enabling (and, subsequently abusive) mom and an outright abusive dad, a former wife to an abusive man, and now a mother to his children- you need to unpack the trauma and abuse of your past NOW. Do it before you repeat some version of this cycle. Take this as big sister or mama advice, I could be either. \n\nGet yourself a great therapist who specializes is adults with childhood trauma and abuse. Read books, listen to podcasts, surround yourself with people and media who bring light. Drop people who fill your time with darkness and negativity. Add people who bring value and real life genuineness to your world, and give back the same. \n\nI always recommend Nedra Tawwab\u2019s Set Boundaries, Find Peace (truly, a real education on boundaries) and Glennon Doyle\u2019s Untamed. Glennon Doyle\u2019s We Can Do Hard Things Podcast- the guests she brings on are truly gifted and powerful and I\u2019ve learned so much about myself. It\u2019s my free therapy when I can\u2019t afford sessions.", "Bruh, he needs to be on a serial killer watch list. That is literally the first step in a line before they start killing."]}
