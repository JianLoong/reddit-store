Therefore I really want most of them to be there. \n\nThe issue is mainly with my stepdad. \nMy parents divorced when I was about five years old and my mom remarried two years later (my dad\u2018s childhood best friend). So my parents were not always on best terms.\n\nMy childhood was kinda bad due to their whole dispute and my stepdad and I always had a strained relationship. The older I got the worse it got. It really took a toll on my mental health and whenever my therapist suggested something to improve my mental health he straight up refused to do it or to even change his ways in the slightest. My mom fought a lot with him due to that for some time but she gave up trying and stayed with him (sometimes just for the sake of my younger half-brother, whom I dearly love and cherish). \nBut having my mom disregard my health for my brother\u2019s was still hard to deal with in my early teenage years.\n\nA few examples: \n\n- stepdad told me (when I was about 10/11) that no one would care about my day and that I should simply stop talking about it cause it was simply annoying to him. \n\n- when I was on the verge of mentally breaking completely my therapist suggested a pet as an emotional support. My stepdad hates pets so he just refused even though he was told that I would only get worse without a living being to emotionally support me\n\n- when I misbehaved as a child he didn\u2019t communicate with me but showed me index cards with his rules. When I still didn\u2019t follow through with them I was not allowed to eat and had to sit on the stairs without talking or anything \nmy younger brother (his son) never had or has to follow through with any rules and misbehaves a lot (no consequences tho)\n\n- overall he didn\u2019t and still does not communicate with me. He did not talk to me for the 12 years I lived with them. He did not treat me like a family member or even a family friend \n\nThere were a few smaller things, too, but he\u2019s overall not the nicest person.\n\nDue to my mom always demanding for him to come to all my mayor life events my dad missed out on a lot of them (even though I want him to be there every step of the way). \nShe straight up refuses to go without him because my dad is allowed to bring his wife and she doesn\u2019t want to show up alone. I kinda get where she is coming from but I don\u2019t want to deal with my unresolved feelings and issues on my special occasions. Therefore I told her that if she doesn\u2019t want to attend without him she can simply stay away and if she shows up with him she will be uninvited from every single future event.\n\nA few of my family members (mainly my mom\u2019s/stepdad\u2019s side) told me that I am overreacting and being a brat and I should just let him come.

We don't have enough evidence to get full custody, but we are trying.\n\nThe fact is, even though my youngest idolizes his mother, she is openly and actively choosing to be with a man that \\[censored for rules\\] her child, because she \"loves\" him.\n\nYour mother is choosing your stepdad and has been for decades. How could she possibly be your \"biggest supporter\" if she lives with a man who has treated you this way for the majority of your life?\n\nYou're NTA, to be clear, but your mother and stepdad very much are.

It may also be possible they have absolutely no idea how you have been mistreated.\n\nYour boundary is reasonable and understandable. People who are invited should be people who actually care about you and support you. If your mom can\u2019t handle being there alone, that\u2019s her failing - not yours.

She never would have done what OP\u2019s\nMom has done. \n\n\nOP asked if she was an AH for saying what she said to her mom.. she is NTA for that. The AH\u2019s are her step father for what he did, and her mom for allowing it. The only thing OP is doing is what her mom should\u2019ve done.
