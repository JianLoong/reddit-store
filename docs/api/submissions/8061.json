Therefore I really want most of them to be there. \n\nThe issue is mainly with my stepdad. \nMy parents divorced when I was about five years old and my mom remarried two years later (my dad\u2018s childhood best friend). So my parents were not always on best terms.\n\nMy childhood was kinda bad due to their whole dispute and my stepdad and I always had a strained relationship. The older I got the worse it got. It really took a toll on my mental health and whenever my therapist suggested something to improve my mental health he straight up refused to do it or to even change his ways in the slightest. My mom fought a lot with him due to that for some time but she gave up trying and stayed with him (sometimes just for the sake of my younger half-brother, whom I dearly love and cherish). \nBut having my mom disregard my health for my brother\u2019s was still hard to deal with in my early teenage years.\n\nA few examples: \n\n- stepdad told me (when I was about 10/11) that no one would care about my day and that I should simply stop talking about it cause it was simply annoying to him. \n\n- when I was on the verge of mentally breaking completely my therapist suggested a pet as an emotional support. My stepdad hates pets so he just refused even though he was told that I would only get worse without a living being to emotionally support me\n\n- when I misbehaved as a child he didn\u2019t communicate with me but showed me index cards with his rules. When I still didn\u2019t follow through with them I was not allowed to eat and had to sit on the stairs without talking or anything \nmy younger brother (his son) never had or has to follow through with any rules and misbehaves a lot (no consequences tho)\n\n- overall he didn\u2019t and still does not communicate with me. He did not talk to me for the 12 years I lived with them. He did not treat me like a family member or even a family friend \n\nThere were a few smaller things, too, but he\u2019s overall not the nicest person.\n\nDue to my mom always demanding for him to come to all my mayor life events my dad missed out on a lot of them (even though I want him to be there every step of the way). \nShe straight up refuses to go without him because my dad is allowed to bring his wife and she doesn\u2019t want to show up alone. I kinda get where she is coming from but I don\u2019t want to deal with my unresolved feelings and issues on my special occasions. Therefore I told her that if she doesn\u2019t want to attend without him she can simply stay away and if she shows up with him she will be uninvited from every single future event.\n\nA few of my family members (mainly my mom\u2019s/stepdad\u2019s side) told me that I am overreacting and being a brat and I should just let him come. This makes me feel insecure about my decision. So AITA?\n\nEdit: \nBecause a lot of people seem to have a strong dislike for my mom I wanted to say some things:\n\nShe very much knows what happened to me as a child but she herself was badly abused by her own parents and had to basically raise herself. My dad physically and mentally mistreated her when they were younger and long before I was born (but he never treated me badly). She still tried and whenever she realized what happened she tried to give me as much attention as possible to kinda cancel out his neglect.\n\nShe is a good person, who was mistreated horribly in her life and who was just not fit to be a mother when I was young. I am by no means saying that I condone what she allowed to happen. She\u2019s just broken and sometimes broken people tend to do the same to others.", "created_utc": 1674471897, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10j9xa2/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_wont_be_allowed_to/", "score": 1088, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Really miss that old grumpy man after reading the comments here.", "My mental health at that point heavily depended on them as I was about seven years old. I have been to therapists for various reasons later on but in regards to my issues as a child it was mainly because my parents wanted to be told that something was wrong with me and they did not like it very much when it was suggested that while I might be a bit special and needed treatment they were very much at fault for the majority of my other mental problems.", "I mean, he literally abused OP, so yeah, I think it\u2019s valid to suggest he change his fucked up, abusive ways.", "First and foremost: I\u2019m sorry that you had no access to a therapist yourself. I think it\u2019s very important to talk about personal issues and mental health problems and whenever I hear that someone did not have those resources it makes me sad. \n\nI am very happy about the fact that my mom and my dad want to be there with me but my stepdad has literally no personal interest to be there. My mother is simply stringing him along out of her own interests. If he behaved differently nowadays I would never be exclude him. But he doesn\u2019t and I don\u2019t see any reason to let something that I cherish be ruined by his presence. \n\nAlso: I have a graduation because I fought for it. Every day. I had to work on many of my mental problems and I had to do so by myself. Because my parents took me out of therapy after there were told certain things they had to change. I am graduating because I made myself strong and not because trauma made me strong or something. I am grateful for myself and this achievement but that does not mean that I did not have to fight for it like most people that struggle do.", "For anyone who downvotes or comments after this;\n\nblasphemous_priest is a 20 day old troll account, don't even dignify it any further arguments.", "My dad\u2019s in the military and he still looked for ways to take me in when I was younger and told him that I wanted to move in with him but it wouldn\u2019t have worked out. He lives an hour away  and I didn\u2019t want to change schools or leave my friends. So it\u2019s not really his fault", "Perfect!", "Depriving a child of food is physical abuse. \n\nOP, do the family members who say you\u2019re overreacting know that your mother\u2019s husband regularly refused to allow you to eat?\n\nYour mother allowed her husband to abuse you and refuses to acknowledge that or do anything to protect you, even now.

Didn't make that connection", "NTA - based on that comment alone, I would have immediately gone no contact with her and cut her out of my life, sorry you had to hear that.", "NTA, I hope you find support with your fathers side of your family.", "Out of curiosity where was your actual father, did he have visitation? I\u2019m so terribly sorry you went through this trauma. It must feel so liberating being on your own and having the freedom to make these choices. You have every right to keep your abuser as far away from you as possible it\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure your mother is comfortable at your life celebrations. it\u2019s your turn to have the beautiful life you have always deserved.", "NTA. Maybe it in the US it isn't but atleast where i live not feeding children under your care properly and using removal of food as punishment is actually considered criminal child abuse and children are removed from homes for it. So yes your friends were right to be horrified. Your mothers husband was abusive and she by not protecting you from it failed you and you are now protecting yourself by removing him from important points in your life. If she can't deal with that tough she should have done a better from as a mother when you were young so this wouldn't an issue today.", "That's really sweet of you. Thank you. I also hope that you're able to have a positive and supportive relationship with your mom, sans your stepdad.   \n\n\nJust know that this random bonus mom on the internet is also rooting for you to be able to have a wonderful relationship with the parents who created you and the one who chose you.", "Congratulations on your graduation OP!!!

You have the right to express your feelings when and where you want your mom is a piece of s***and your stepdad is way worse.", "Your mom is a selfish moron that cared more about having a man (and the circumstances of him being your father's friend make me believe there was cheating involved) than looking after her own child.\n\n\nIf you gonna let the past be the past, drop all this toxic and awful people with it, have a great graduation with your dad and stepmom.", "Tell her that because she let you be abused, her being your mother is in the past.", "This is your mother not wanting to be held accountable for her actions. \n\nBoth of them have emotionally abused you as a child.

Tell your mom to STFU.", "I'm sorry, but your Mom is part of the problem right now, not the solution.  Don't explain, just set boundaries.

Yeah, that would be a good thing to leave there.", "NTA.
