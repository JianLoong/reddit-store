(My twin sister and I are in our late teens, my brother and my cousin sisters are in mid 20s.) The hill also had a temple inviting devotees to worship. The trip was for two days and one night only.\n\nThe hill is 3842 m high and the road wasn't paved. Since there was no air transportation, the option for traveling was by bus or jeep. The jeep was private so we booked the trip by jeep. Then the day before the trip the travel agency called and told they couldn't book any jeep so they would provide a bus and a good resort for a cheaper price. \n\nWe had to agree as this was only the time five of us were free. We wanted to reserve seats in the bus but they told whoever comes first would get their required seats. \n\nWhen we reached the bus stop, there was no bus. We called the driver to ask the location but he wasn't good at giving directions but we managed to find the bus.\n\nThe seats were already taken so we had to sit at the back which was very painful as the road wasn't paved so the ride was very bumpy. We traveled for nine hours and our backs hurt.\n\nWe asked what time the bus leaves tomorrow to be on time. He said the bus would leave at 10. \n\nNext day, we got on the bus at 10 am and it was empty so we sat in the middle so that the ride would be comfortable. It was already 10:30 and nobody except for us had come. Driver got angry and called the passengers to hurry up. Slowly passengers started to show up. \n\nThe family who were sitting at the seats that we were sitting in yesterday demanded their seats back. We told them seats weren't reserved so it wasn't their seats. They gave the excuse of having children and old people traveling with them so we sat one seat behind. The bus took off at 11. \n\nAfter riding for more than half hour, driver got a call that he missed a few passengers. We waited for the passengers to arrive for half an hour. It was already 12.\n\nWhen they arrived they also demanded their seats back. We told them to sit at the back where the seats were available. They also gave excuses of having a child and elderly traveling with them so my sister and I sat one seat back. The elderly and child sat at the front but the lady who was with them didn't. She demanded to sit with them and told my cousins to sit at the back. \n\nWe argued about compromising enough and it wasn't fair. Still they argued that we were being ridiculous and stubborn. The lady was in her mid 30s so my cousins didn't give up their seats. The previous family also claimed that we were wrong. We told them our backs hurt but they told us if they sat at the back their backs would hurt too. We argued for 15 minutes straight. \n\nFirst they made us 2 hours late, second they did not apologize for coming late and third they started fighting with us just for seats. There were seats available at the back but they refused to sit. We had compromised twice and instead of being grateful they yelled at us but we didn't give up.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1667118368, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh907r/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_bus_seat/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
