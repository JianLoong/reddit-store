Sure she wasn\u2019t a great mom but she appear to be legitimate reasons for some things. Not having food as much as it might suck was probably a money issue rather than a not caring issue. A single mom raising her husband\u2019s child from another woman was always going to struggle to emotionally connect and having a constant reminder of her husband was probably a guy punch every day. But this stepsister takes the cake for sure. Just no attempt to connect or care.", "NTA, she wasn\u2019t a good \u201cmother\u201d figure to you from what you describe, but cut her some slack. She is clearly still in your life if you are talking to her about your child. She was what, 25, when she became the guardian of a teenager, when no other adults were available to take you in? She would have learned not just how to be a parent, but how to take care of a teen, was a young adult learning to take care of herself, all while losing her mother.

You  Ean well and think you can have normal conversions with your \"fAMILY.\"\n\nYou can't have these conversations with those who raised you.  You lost people (adult who loved you) in you childhood and were a bit lost.\n\nYour step sister is NOT a role model.  She did her best bust she also had an imperfect childhood.\n\nShe is NOT the  reservoir of advice that you are looking for.  Right now,  go to books, go to older people who seem to have raised half way decent children. \n\nKylie was doing the nest she can with her child(ren).

Just as her adult life was starting out.\nTeenagers are awful. You were a 14 yo girl with many issues. Let's not pretend you were a saint.\nShe says she did her best and I believe her. It must have been very, very hard. Almost as hard as hearing that the work and love she put into you wasn't appreciated.\nPerhaps when your kid is a teenager you'll understand her better.\nOh she was very imperfect... But she tried.\nI feel YTA, she deserves a bit more gratitude than you're capable of giving...", "YTA - but only in the context of needlessly insulting her.   \n  \nI think that any young adult would struggle if the responsibility of their step-sibling was suddenly dropped on them. She might have been terrible to live with, irresponsible and controlling but you weren't her child and her life plan didn't incorporate becoming the legal guardian of her step-sister. I can empathise with her in that regard, it must have been very difficult for her to try and be a \"good parent\" when she knew you as her step-sister - the daughter of her mother's new husband. Andrea suffered a grievance, you suffered a grievance and Kylie suffered a grievance. \n\nI can empathise with everyone in this situation, but I think that you need to cut her some slack. As an adult you should be aware that the position she was put in was less that ideal for her, harbouring resentment isn't healthy, especially given the circumstances that all of this came to fruition from. I think it might be time to let those feelings of resentment pass and show some understanding, she doesn't sound like a malicious person, she was put in a tough spot and the cracks started to show.", "I see your point, but I\u2019m going to have to disagree.\n\nAndrea starved the girl, and she literally had to ask permission to eat, and punished her for things that were out of her control.\n\nYes, it\u2019s unfortunate she had to raise a young teen, but she\u2019s old enough to know right from wrong, and she emotionally and somewhat physically neglected OP.", "Young??

I remember 25, I wasn't a selfish angry monster to my younger siblings.", "Struggling is not outright denying a child food and locking it up or leaving a young child with strange men who can do god knows what to her.

She didn't have to. Your step mother, also didn't have to. I'm sorry that no one in your family stepped up to give you the Full House treatment but the fact you didn't end up in foster care is a result of a LOT of sacrifice by people who owed you nothing.", "Cut her some slack.

I could barely look after myself at the time, and teenagers are I understand not the easiest to live with at the best of times.\n\nFor her to become your guardian at all was probably a blessing, though I grant neither then or now it felt like it. 14 year olds in shared care/foster homes by and large have it a lot worse than what you have described.\n\nIt does sound like you need to talk these things out with her - she obviously cares about you.", "She tried to step up by abusing a child?
