Just like you are to me.\"", "NTA- next time anyone calls you tell them the answer is no and if they keep contacting you, you will file harassment charges.  If they dare show up, call the police.", "NTA. Do NOT give in. Stand your ground. This is the first domino. If you give in to this, they\u2019ll see you as malleable and push you around in the future. This may have once been your grandmother\u2019s farm, but it is now yours, and you do with it as you wish. This includes not allowing people who mistreated you to use it\n\nEnjoy your life like your grandma would\u2019ve wanted you to. In true farm fashion, your family must reap what they sow", "NTA!

You have every right to turn her down, especially as she has only got in touch with you after all this time to ask a favour. On the other hand, did your sisters inherit anything when your grandmother died?  If not then they may feel it's unfair that you're not willing to grant that favour, so I wouldn't blame her for asking you the question.

My property is off limits.

They treated you poorly, sent you to your grandmothers, and were EXCITED when you asked to live with her.  \n\n\nNow your grandmother decided to leave her whole estate to you and the rest of the family is mad they have to deal with the repercussions of their own actions. It's kind of awesome to be honest. To hell with them.  \n\n\nI'm very glad you've found happiness in the farm, and I hope you continue to do so!  \n\n\nI'd go back to no contact with your family.
