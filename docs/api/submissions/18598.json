We both got degrees in the same general field but have different specializations, but my girlfriend also got a minor in my specialization. I graduated early a year ago and my girlfriend recently graduated. I am currently in between jobs and my girlfriend is job searching as well.\n\nA while ago I applied to a really good job in the city we both wanted to move to. It had good pay and benefits. A week later my girlfriend told me about what sounded like the same job posting, saying that she had applied to it. I was a little worried that we were both competing for the same job, which was something that I sometimes thought about but always dismissed because our specializations are different. I debated telling her that I applied to the same job, but decided not to because there was a chance neither of us would get the job and telling her would just cause unnecessary stress. I also figured that it might not even be the same job positing because both of our specializations are different, just a similar job from the same company. In hindsight I probably should have told her, but there's nothing I can do about it now.\n\nA few weeks later I found out that I had been rejected from the job, but later my gf excitedly told me that she had gotten the job she had talked about. I asked her to show me the job and it was the very same one. I was pretty surprised since the job had more to do with my specialization than hers and although she does have a minor in my specialization, I had thought I would be more likely to get the job. I told her that I had applied to the same job and had gotten rejected, and she asked if I was okay. I told her that it didn't matter since at least one of us had gotten it, but in reality I was pretty sad and jealous about it. I ended up telling her this a few days later and she got really sad. She is debating if she should actually take the offer because of my feelings, but I don't want her to give up a good job opportunity to spare my feelings. All of this has me wondering if I'm being unreasonable by being sad. AITA?\n\nEdit: I am really proud of her for getting the position, especially since its in the city we both eventually want to move to. I do want her to take the position and when she told me that she was considering not taking it I told her that it wouldn't change the fact that I had been rejected. The job is a great opportunity and I will get over my feelings and find another job. I just feel bad because I feel like my emotions are getting in the way of her decision.", "created_utc": 1685497677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w8twy/aita_for_being_jealous_that_my_girlfriend_got_the/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are allowed to feel disappointed that you didn't get the job, but you don't get to make her feel bad for taking the job and being successful with it. Find a way to get beyond your hurt, and support your girlfriend.", "NAH personally, you have a right to be upset about not getting the job, as long as you don't take it out on her. Be happy for her in the meantime while you continue job searching. Good luck!", "NTA but you better tell her to take the job. Your feels are valid but shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of her accomplishments", "YWBTA if you let her walk away from this job offer. You're also an AH for allowing your disappointment to eclipse her happiness. \n\nIn addition to her focus she has a minor in your specialty. That will often make her the more favorable candidate when competing for the same position.", "INFO what did you tell her when you said it made you sad and jealous?\nYour feelings are normal, and understandable given this coincidence. judgment depends on how you handled it and expressed it to her. Since she\u2019s considering not taking it\u2026 I\u2019m just wondering how that went down", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to be upset about not getting the job, and it sounds like you\u2019ve handled it in a mature way by talking to your girlfriend about it, and by not wanting her to turn it down on your account. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, there are lots of factors that will influence hiring, beyond just qualifications. She may have written a really great cover letter with why she wants to work there, which will usually outweigh pure qualifications. Something like that might have given the company the impression that she\u2019d be a good fit with their current team, etc.", "NTA (yet). You never told her not to take the job, right? It was definitely the right thing to do to be honest about your feelings, and it\u2019s not unreasonable for you to be sad and jealous. But ultimately if it\u2019s a good job she should take it. If I were you, I would definitely encourage her to take it. \n\nI think YWBTA if you told her not to take it because of your feelings, but you haven\u2019t done that.", "NAH. It sounds like you are reasonably irked by rejection but being supportive of your GF.\n\nFor those giving a A rating saying you should hide your feelings... Dishonesty is not a good policy! Sharing feelings is GOOD. There's no manipulation going on here.", "NAH.\n\nDisappointment happens, just support her the way you would have wanted her to support you and you're golden.\n\nWho knows why she was selected instead. Most of the managers I have worked with say Hire for the attitude, the rest we can teach. Maybe she clicked well. Maybe you had an off day. Or maybe your resume didn't quite tick the boxes they were looking for.\n\nIn the end, the two of you are a team. And this is great news for the team!", "YTA if you let her walk away from that job to spare your feelings", "NTA because what you\u2019re feeling is normal and apart of being human plus you don\u2019t want her to give up the opportunity either", "YWBTAH if you are unable to support your GF in accepting this position.  She should not be required to bow out because she was selected over you.\n\nI have done recruiting and there are many things that go into the cut.  Many good candidates are passed over when competition is fierce because they just didn't score high enough in all the categories the employer was using to make that cut.  Doesn't mean you are no good, just that overall they felt your GF was a better fit for what they had in mind or maybe even to work with their existing staff.  Sure, it's a blow to your ego to be passed over but your GF should not have to pay for that.\n\nBottom line is you need to NEVER resent your GF's accomplishments but rather to be a true, supportive partner and be happy for her and to keep trying to find your own good position elsewhere.  Her not taking the position would not make it yours either, so give that some thought.\n\nWe all have disappointments at times when seeking good positions.  Don't lose heart, just keep trying.  Honestly, it's the quitters who never succeed. Go forward with a good attitude, a good presentation, and a willingness to work hard and to get along with co-workers.  Good luck!", "YTA. It\u2019s okay to be disappointed. It\u2019s not okay that you\u2019re pouting and making your feelings so known to your girlfriend that she feels guilty and is considering passing up an opportunity she\u2019s excited about.", "YTA it's okay to feel the initial disappointment but you are behaving like a massive AH in making her feel bad about it. What did you hope to achieve? She feels guilty, gives up the posting you all go back to square one then she gets the next job over you again?\n\nBased on how you are dealing with this I'm almost certain it's a matter of character that she got the job over you.", "YTA. You literally didn't need to tell her that you applied, and smother her joy about the situation. You could've been proud of her, and kept looking. You don't know why she got the job over you. The interviewer could've like her shoes or some other stupid, insignificant reason. Get over yourself.", "You\u2019re a team. You should be *ecstatic* that one of you got it, even if that one wasn\u2019t you. YTA.", "YTA. Jeez. Let your gf enjoy her job and be supportive instead of a jealous idiot. The company obviously saw something in her that you don't have. And you never told her about the job posting. Had you told her she probably won't have applied in the first place.", "YWBTA\n\nYou are certainly allowed to feel jealous or bummed out. You can feel whatever emotions you want\n\nYour actions will determine whether you are an asshole or not. She absolutely should not pass on this job just to spare your pride. You should be supportive and caring and try to resolve your feelings\n\nIf you do anything that results in her not taking the job or make her feel bad about taking it, then you are an asshole", "N T A  for feeling disappointed, but soft YTA for *telling* her you were disappointed. It would have been much better to vent with someone else so that you could get it out of your system and be happy for her. Well done on continuing to encourage her to take the position, though.", "YTA.  Tell her to take the job.  She earned it.  And, next time, find someone else to vent to.", "YTA. Be proud of your GF.", "NTAH \u2026 you can be upset you didn\u2019t get it but still be happy for her. Just make it clear that even though you were excited for the possibility of the job and are upset you didn\u2019t get it, you\u2019re still happy and proud of her. You can also take the opportunity to ask her to take a look at your resume to see if there are ways you can improve yours.", "Why are you mad? Atleast you can take the opportunity to visit your gf and roast the one who rejected you ;D", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Experience and qualifications do play a role, but there is more to it. Maybe it would be useful for you to review her CV, cover letter, etc. and reevaluate yours. Demographics also might play a role, as some companies have goals around diversity. \n\nOP, take this chance to reevaluate and practice being grateful and proud of your partner. I do think expressing the feelings is helpful, but stay honest with yourself and if the jealousy remains, try to work on it, seek help, etc.", "Hiding his feelings, then later having pent up sadness affect their relationship, would be far worse.\n\nIt\u2019s natural to be sad.
