We both got degrees in the same general field but have different specializations, but my girlfriend also got a minor in my specialization. I graduated early a year ago and my girlfriend recently graduated. I am currently in between jobs and my girlfriend is job searching as well.\n\nA while ago I applied to a really good job in the city we both wanted to move to. It had good pay and benefits. A week later my girlfriend told me about what sounded like the same job posting, saying that she had applied to it. I was a little worried that we were both competing for the same job, which was something that I sometimes thought about but always dismissed because our specializations are different. I debated telling her that I applied to the same job, but decided not to because there was a chance neither of us would get the job and telling her would just cause unnecessary stress. I also figured that it might not even be the same job positing because both of our specializations are different, just a similar job from the same company. In hindsight I probably should have told her, but there's nothing I can do about it now.\n\nA few weeks later I found out that I had been rejected from the job, but later my gf excitedly told me that she had gotten the job she had talked about. I asked her to show me the job and it was the very same one. I was pretty surprised since the job had more to do with my specialization than hers and although she does have a minor in my specialization, I had thought I would be more likely to get the job. I told her that I had applied to the same job and had gotten rejected, and she asked if I was okay. I told her that it didn't matter since at least one of us had gotten it, but in reality I was pretty sad and jealous about it. I ended up telling her this a few days later and she got really sad. She is debating if she should actually take the offer because of my feelings, but I don't want her to give up a good job opportunity to spare my feelings. All of this has me wondering if I'm being unreasonable by being sad. AITA?\n\nEdit: I am really proud of her for getting the position, especially since its in the city we both eventually want to move to. I do want her to take the position and when she told me that she was considering not taking it I told her that it wouldn't change the fact that I had been rejected. The job is a great opportunity and I will get over my feelings and find another job. I just feel bad because I feel like my emotions are getting in the way of her decision.", "created_utc": 1685497677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w8twy/aita_for_being_jealous_that_my_girlfriend_got_the/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure, it's a blow to your ego to be passed over but your GF should not have to pay for that.\n\nBottom line is you need to NEVER resent your GF's accomplishments but rather to be a true, supportive partner and be happy for her and to keep trying to find your own good position elsewhere.

I get it, it totally sucks when you don't make the cut for any job. But you're a young adult. You will apply to many jobs in your career; get accepted by some, get rejected by some. Now while you're not wrong for feeling a bit dejected and wondering why you didn't make the cut, you shouldn't have projected your feelings of jealousy on your gf. I'm all for communication and I get why you told her your true feelings, but now you've left her feeling that she needs to make a compromise so as to not hurt your feelings. Bud, I guess you know this already but she doesn't owe it to you to make you feel better. If you haven't done this already; **please tell her to take up the job ASAP!!** It just so happens that you are in the same field, but you very well know you wouldn't have reacted this way if you guys were in different fields. Also this comes across as a little pretentious to me:\n\n>I was pretty surprised since the job had more to do with my specialization than hers and although she does have a minor in my specialization, I had thought I would be more likely to get the job.\n\nSo basically you feel you are more deserving of the job than her? That's a big no-no. That's not up to you to decide. Yes you may have been extremely qualified for the job but your qualifications are just _one thing_ that employers look out for. There are other factors they look out for when hiring a candidate. You're a grown adult. You should be proud of your girlfriend, and **stop equating her success to your 'failure'.** There are so many other candidates who didn't get the job too. If I can give you a bit of advice, stop viewing her as competition. I know at that moment in time, you both were candidates applying to the same position; but at the end of the day you are bf and gf. You need to support each other. If she got the job, it's cause they think she deserved it. It's as simple as that. You can still have a few minutes to yourself to sulk, but then chin up and take her out to celebrate.\n\n>I was a little worried that we were both competing for the same job\n\nWhy does it worry you? Did it not occur to you that this was a possibility? And do you (even subconsciously) think that you being in the same field as her means she needs to back out from applying to certain posts; just to leave them open for you? You guys are just two fish in a big sea. You need better ways to cope with this. If being in the same profession is a deal breaker for you, then trust me it will turn toxic real quick. My parents worked in the same company for years and never had an issue. I know of a couple that were doctors at the same hospital. If anything they bettered each other by taking each other's opinions. Who knows, maybe now that your gf is in; she can possibly pull a few strings and land you a job there? Stop looking at this as black and white. See the silver linings. You are not a failure, neither does this make her better than you. Just be supportive of her. And I'm sure you will have many other wonderful opportunities for yourself. I hope you land a great job soon :)", "YTA. Your jealousy is pitiful. Are you one of those males who can't stand it if the wife has a better paying job? Who gets upset when the wife is more successful? So you did not get the job. Tough luck. She got it, be happy at least one of you got it. Do you think she would have been jealous if you had gotten the job and she did not? I doubt it. And then *telling* her about your childish feelings makes it even more AH behaviour, for now she feels sad and uncomfortable. Even if she takes it, it's stained and she will always know how you feel about it. You're a bad boyfriend.", "YTA- A company don't employ the best of people they employ the one we can control and cheapest of all.", "You applied for the job earlier and wasn\u2019t immediately contacted so there\u2019s a pretty good chance you weren\u2019t going to get it regardless of your girlfriends application.  You\u2019re allowed to be disappointed but don\u2019t overshadow your girlfriends success or let this be something that festers. NAH but potential to become one.", "That will often make her the more favorable candidate when competing for the same position.", "He told her she should take the job. Bottling up his feelings doesn't do anyone any good in the long run either. \n\n>Based on how you are dealing with this I'm almost certain it's a matter of character that she got the job over you.\n\nOh yea cause corporations totally care about how emotionally mature you are\ud83d\ude44. 90% sure they only hired her because they could get away with paying her less. This is a corporation we're talking about here, they're not exactly good Samaritans.", "I think you're overall handling it in a mature way.  We all get to have our feelings.  But I would emphasize to her that you encourage her to take it,  because in the long run,  you'll regret it a lot more if you know you cost her this opportunity.   \n\nHer giving it up won't give the job to you.  You both know this,  but your emotions maybe  don't.  If she gives it up,  all it means is you both get to miss out,  and she will resent you for it in time, even if you never asked her to give it up.  So find room to be a little bit more emphatic that you want her to take it,  and be as happy as you can for her.  Maybe in time she can also refer you for a similar role.", ">Demographics also might play a role, as some companies have goals around diversity. \n\nThis. A lot of companies are on board with affirmative action and that includes giving women the leg up that men have had.\n\nI think on top of that though, the fact she has a minor and OP majored in whatever specialization they're looking for, also played a part. She's technically less qualified so they could technically get away with paying her less and not have to worry about a competing company stealing her with a better offer."]}
