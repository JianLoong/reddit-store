She invited you to a pity party and you RSVPd \u201chell no\u201d.  Thats totally fine.\n\nShe was fortunate to have so many talents and opportunities in life.  She made a great life for herself and then set them all on fire, with not one, but a series of horrible decisions.  She hasn\u2019t earned the right to then claim she\u2019s the victim.  She would be best serve pulling herself back up rather than enjoying being at rock bottom.", "NTA. In certain professions (attorney, therapist, doctor, etc) it is pounded into your head all throughout school and training that one thing you Do Not do is get involved with a client. It crosses a major professional boundary. Even if she was not involved in his case, she still broke the law by smuggling in contraband and her actions were a huge liability to her employer. Your sister has no one to blame but herself. She needs to acknowledge her fault in the situation and move on. She\u2019s not going to get anywhere ruminating on what happened. The best thing she can do is consider it a lesson learned and focus on getting her kid back.", "NTA. \n\nWhile she may be at rock bottom, its by her own making. \n\nYou could have just walked away, which may have been the better choice honestly, but I can 100% understand that if someone is constantly complaining about their choices, that they actively took, in life, aka a pity party of their own making, in hopes that someone sides with them, is very tiring and annoying.", "maybe unpopular but NTA. your sister made a LOT of decisions, not just one \"mistake,\" and still is trying to play the victim card. like it does suck and it's unfair but it's not cool to keep making other people listen to how wronged she feels. it's one thing to vent \"this is hard and it sucks,\" and another to keep trying to find other people to blame. it was maybe harsh for how you said it, but this isn't exactly kicking someone when they're down. this is letting someone know you're not cool with them playing victim loudly and repeatedly in a way that divorces them from responsibility.", "NTA, I don't understand how everyone is saying YTA, sometimes you have to be blunt and honest especially with the people who you love and sometimes people need to hear things they don't want to hear. You can't live in a victim mentality your whole life blaming your mistakes on others so I think you were in the right with calling her out, she wouldn't be where she's at now if she didn't do what she did, she's never going to take accountability and responsibility for what's she's done if everyone just excuses or ignores her actions.", "I don\u2019t understand all the Y T A judgments. Letting her vent a few times makes sense, but it sounds like she\u2019s CONSTANTLY whining about this and has been for years, while simultaneously taking zero responsibility for her actions.\n\nNTA If your parents choose to keep listening, that\u2019s their choice, but I\u2019d keep telling her you don\u2019t want to hear anymore of her self centered, poor me act.", "NTA. More people need to start accepting the role they play in their own lives. Hopefully your worlds are the wake up call she needs to actually change her life around.", "NTA \n\nEspecially the shagging a criminal client in jail. \n\nI mean every solicitor knows you\u2019re not allowed to be involved with a client. But to illegally smuggle him stuff in jail and get busted shagging him is straight up dumb!", "NTA\n\nI've known too many people who regularly make poor choices, and then continuously bemoan for YEARS how the world is unfair and out to get them. For these people, nothing is ever their fault. Not the stuff that happened yesterday, not the stuff that happened today, and not the stuff that will happen tomorrow.\n\nThey will always be at some variation of rock bottom. They may briefly pop up and appear to be great for a moment, but then they'll do something dumb again and back to the bottom they go.\n\nThese sorts of people truly need a wake-up call. Or at the very least to not be continuously coddled by everyone around them. That's just feeding their victim narrative.", "NTA - Just proves that sometimes education does not equal emotional intelligence.", "NTA. You know what, your sister made a bucket full of horrible (some even illegal) choices, and she is, in fact, nowhere near a victim. She chose again and again, and is feeling the consequences, and is bitter that oh no, the world didn't bend over for her criminal boyfriend and herself, his Bonnie.\n\nPerhaps your dad's attitude says a lot about how she got to this victimized, self-centered, entitled mindset. She's not a child, she's just acting like one - except her crimes are a *tad* more dire than what most kids get up to.", "NTA\n\nLawyer here. Since you mentioned ivy league, I'm presuming USA. There's literally a whole ass class we are required to take as law students on professional responsibility that is required before a portion of the bar exams called the multistate professional responsibility examination  (MPRE). \n\n Three big takeaways from this class that stay with me over 10 years later:\n1) don't lie to the courts/judges\n2) don't steal money from clients\n3) for the love of (your diety of choice), unless there is a pre-established romantic/sexual relationship*, Do NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ENGAGE IN SEXUAL OR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH YOUR CLIENTS.\n\n*exceptions are still side eyed to hell due to ethical boundaries \n\nYour sister went into this with eyes open but likely figured she was too brilliant to ever be caught. She's blaming everyone and everything else because she doesn't want to face the reality of her circumstances. Good on you for not buying into her fantasy.", "NTA. Her attitude is keeping her from moving forward and it should not be entertained.", "NTA. She may not want to hear it but it needed to be said.", "NTA. And I don't think your sister has hit rock bottom yet. Given that she hasn't admitted fault, she still has farther to fall. \n\nCan you get a job at a summer camp or something like that to get out of the house?", "NTA - What your sister did was not a mistake, it was a calculated campaign of self-destruction. No one who reached the level she did in schooling and employment is simple minded. Her behavior was massively self-centered and violated just about every ethical rule she could possibly have managed. Now she's lost all her professional and social prestige, her child and her ability to earn a good living. This isn't like someone who was mugged in the street and lost their wallet. This is someone who deliberately undertook illegal and unethical actions and now is unhappy because the piper is demanding to be paid. As the daughter of two attorneys I have absolutely no sympathy whatsoever for the stupid choices that she made. She's going to have to work long and hard to dig herself out of this hole that she created. Demanding that everyone feels sorry for her because she FAFO'd it's just another example of her toxic level of self-centeredness. You don't owe her any apology for telling her the truth. Your parents need to stop indulging this pity party of hers and tell her to grow the F up and take accountability for her own actions.", "Take it back? What is she 12?\n\nHonestly, your parents have my sympathy because they\u2019ve seen one of their children fall from such heights to her current situation. That being said, you said nothing incorrect and your sister will continue to have life challenges until she can clearly accept responsibility for her actions. \n\nNTA", "This was a wild ride", "NTA, and for her to have gotten into an Ivy League school and become a lawyer, this was\u2026. Not very smart.", "Nta, im sorry but i will never feel bad for anyone who burns their own life to the ground.", "NTA\n\nThe truth hurts. Your sister felt entitled to do whatever she felt like doing, but doesn\u2019t want to deal with the consequences of her actions. She didn\u2019t learn a thing from her experience.", "NTA- someone intelligent enough for an ivy league college and law school should be able to distinguish between being victimized and piss poor decision making.", "NTA - she is an adult who knew exactly what she was doing and the potential consequences.  You are 100% NTA on being sick of her playing the victim card.  Her bed she made - her bed to now lay on.", "NTA, she has no one to blame but herself. She\u2019s made her bed, and now she gets to lie in it. Speaking from someone who used to be like your sister, she knows she screwed up, but won\u2019t take accountability for it. Don\u2019t worry, OP, you have done absolutely nothing wrong here", "Yes, she's at rock bottom.\n\nShe's the one that attached the rock to her foot, and threw it into the lake... dragging her down with it.  She really only has herself to blame, but seems unable or unwilling to admit it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nI find reddit so forgiving to women who fuck up their lives. You bring it up and reddit calls you out? Wants you to be kinder? No way. If she was a he we'd be taking her DOWN TOWN!!!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Some people need to face reality, and some people need to be slapped in the face with it.", "NTA. This didn\u2019t happen all at the same time. If she was caught she had the opportunity to end the affair and get her life in order. To then go to actively becoming an accomplice is completely on her. It\u2019s a deliberate act that she unequivocally know is wrong. She needs to take responsibility or she\u2019ll never get back on track, but it sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to do that.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister was and is an idiot.", "NTA\n\nNo, it needed to be said, these aren't little mistakes, these are major screw ups, so bad that she lost custody of her son.\n\nShe won't ever get him back with attitude like this.", "NTA. She hasn\u2019t hit rock bottom if she\u2019s not trying to crawl out yet.", "NTA. I believe she fucked around and found out'.", "NTA. \u201cOh no!  Not the natural consequences of your actions! How could anyone foresee this happening!\u201d  \n\nAnd not to rush to an idiot\u2019s defense, while she\u2019s made some massive mistakes, keep in mind these criminal dudes can be charming, manipulative, and charismatic and probably told her everything she wanted to hear about herself that no one else had said. I\u2019d probably back off at this point and not mention it further, for everyone\u2019s sake. She\u2019s paid a pretty high price even if her whining isn\u2019t justified and you were fair to call her on it.", ">Even my dad said I could be kinder to her because she's at rock bottom.\n\nI am honestly not sure I would even want to house her. I wouldn't want to continue a sister relationship so I probably wouldn't care if she was upset. I would be afraid of what else she is going to pull next and that she would try to involve me. \n\nThis wasn't one action. It was a long series of actions. NTA. I'm glad you're leaving again soon. I'm sorry if it's judgemental of me but I would not trust her and I would not want to listen to any of that.\n\nShe's also incorrect. She's lucky she's not also in jail.", "NTA\n\nShe did everything she wasn't supposed to do. She had an affair and got caught and lost everything. SHE was the one who chose to do that. It's no one's fault but herself, so her complaining is completely out of line.", "NTA, your parents are enablers and fostering a victimhood mentality. She did this 100% to herself. Whether she be at rock bottom or not; I believe your reality check was what she needed.", "You have her a wake up call and she didn\u2019t want it.
