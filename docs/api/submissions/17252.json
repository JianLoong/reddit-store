Shortly after she finished ~~high~~ law school she married a surgeon who adored and loved her.\n\nShe threw all that away. She had an affair with one of her clients. His litigation case was from the same acts as his criminal trials. He's a scumbag who had criminal record already. Despite his parents having money his crimes were enough to still put him in jail. He wasn't in jail when they met but my sister got busted when she was visiting him in jail after his sentencing. She visited him as his lawyer but didn't disclose they were in a romantic relationship. They got caught by employees at the jail. She lost her job at the law firm. She tried fighting it but she got disbarred because having a romantic relationship with a client was forbidden. She was sued and she also got arrested for both smuggling things (like a cell phone) into the jail and for helping him cover up his crimes and destroying evidence in the lawsuit. Her husband left her when she got busted at the jail and it came out that the baby she was pregnant with (my nephew) was not his.\n\nIt sounds like a darn soap opera. I was away at college when all this was going on so I only heard details from my mom and dad. I thought they had to exaggerating but it is all true. Now I'm home until the fall when I start graduate school.\n\nMy sister lives with my parents. She's on probation, and is doing a reunification plan to get custody of my nephew back.

My sister works in the stock room at Target.\n\nI'm tired of my sister complaining about how unfair everything is and how she was mistreated and it wasn't that bad. She constantly goes on about it and acts like the victim. I finally snapped and told her it's her fault and she has no one else to blame. I also said it's the wrong attitude to have if she wants to rebuild her life and get custody of my nephew back.\n\nShe's pissed off. Even my dad said I could be kinder to her because she's at rock bottom. Was I wrong for what I said? My sister wasn't a child, she was a highly paid lawyer with an Ivy League education. She knew what she was doing was wrong on so many levels. She created this mess and I'm tired of her constantly complaining and whining.

She invited you to a pity party and you RSVPd \u201chell no\u201d.  Thats totally fine.\n\nShe was fortunate to have so many talents and opportunities in life.  She made a great life for herself and then set them all on fire, with not one, but a series of horrible decisions.  She hasn\u2019t earned the right to then claim she\u2019s the victim.  She would be best serve pulling herself back up rather than enjoying being at rock bottom.", "NTA. In certain professions (attorney, therapist, doctor, etc) it is pounded into your head all throughout school and training that one thing you Do Not do is get involved with a client. It crosses a major professional boundary. Even if she was not involved in his case, she still broke the law by smuggling in contraband and her actions were a huge liability to her employer. Your sister has no one to blame but herself. She needs to acknowledge her fault in the situation and move on. She\u2019s not going to get anywhere ruminating on what happened. The best thing she can do is consider it a lesson learned and focus on getting her kid back.", "NTA. \n\nWhile she may be at rock bottom, its by her own making. \n\nYou could have just walked away, which may have been the better choice honestly, but I can 100% understand that if someone is constantly complaining about their choices, that they actively took, in life, aka a pity party of their own making, in hopes that someone sides with them, is very tiring and annoying.", "maybe unpopular but NTA. your sister made a LOT of decisions, not just one \"mistake,\" and still is trying to play the victim card. like it does suck and it's hard (edit: did say unfair) but it's not cool to keep making other people listen to how wronged she feels. it's one thing to vent \"this is hard and it sucks,\" and another to keep trying to find other people to blame. it was maybe harsh for how you said it, but this isn't exactly kicking someone when they're down. this is letting someone know you're not cool with them playing victim loudly and repeatedly in a way that divorces them from responsibility.\n\nedit: word choice. to be clear, i don't think the situation is actually unfair. poor choice of words.", "NTA, I don't understand how everyone is saying Y T A, sometimes you have to be blunt and honest especially with the people who you love and sometimes people need to hear things they don't want to hear. You can't live in a victim mentality your whole life blaming your mistakes on others so I think you were in the right with calling her out, she wouldn't be where she's at now if she didn't do what she did, she's never going to take accountability and responsibility for what's she's done if everyone just excuses or ignores her actions.", "I don\u2019t understand all the Y T A judgments. Letting her vent a few times makes sense, but it sounds like she\u2019s CONSTANTLY whining about this and has been for years, while simultaneously taking zero responsibility for her actions.\n\nNTA If your parents choose to keep listening, that\u2019s their choice, but I\u2019d keep telling her you don\u2019t want to hear anymore of her self centered, poor me act.", "NTA. More people need to start accepting the role they play in their own lives. Hopefully your worlds are the wake up call she needs to actually change her life around.", "NTA \n\nEspecially the shagging a criminal client in jail. \n\nI mean every solicitor knows you\u2019re not allowed to be involved with a client. But to illegally smuggle him stuff in jail and get busted shagging him is straight up dumb!", "NTA\n\nI've known too many people who regularly make poor choices, and then continuously bemoan for YEARS how the world is unfair and out to get them. For these people, nothing is ever their fault. Not the stuff that happened yesterday, not the stuff that happened today, and not the stuff that will happen tomorrow.\n\nThey will always be at some variation of rock bottom. They may briefly pop up and appear to be great for a moment, but then they'll do something dumb again and back to the bottom they go.\n\nThese sorts of people truly need a wake-up call. Or at the very least to not be continuously coddled by everyone around them. That's just feeding their victim narrative.", "NTA - Just proves that sometimes education does not equal emotional intelligence.", "NTA. You know what, your sister made a bucket full of horrible (some even illegal) choices, and she is, in fact, nowhere near a victim. She chose again and again, and is feeling the consequences, and is bitter that oh no, the world didn't bend over for her criminal boyfriend and herself, his Bonnie.\n\nPerhaps your dad's attitude says a lot about how she got to this victimized, self-centered, entitled mindset. She's not a child, she's just acting like one - except her crimes are a *tad* more dire than what most kids get up to.", "NTA\n\nLawyer here. Since you mentioned ivy league, I'm presuming USA.

She's blaming everyone and everything else because she doesn't want to face the reality of her circumstances. Good on you for not buying into her fantasy.", "NTA. Her attitude is keeping her from moving forward and it should not be entertained.", "NTA. She may not want to hear it but it needed to be said.", "NTA. And I don't think your sister has hit rock bottom yet. Given that she hasn't admitted fault, she still has farther to fall. \n\nCan you get a job at a summer camp or something like that to get out of the house?", "NTA - What your sister did was not a mistake, it was a calculated campaign of self-destruction. No one who reached the level she did in schooling and employment is simple minded. Her behavior was massively self-centered and violated just about every ethical rule she could possibly have managed. Now she's lost all her professional and social prestige, her child and her ability to earn a good living. This isn't like someone who was mugged in the street and lost their wallet. This is someone who deliberately undertook illegal and unethical actions and now is unhappy because the piper is demanding to be paid. As the daughter of two attorneys I have absolutely no sympathy whatsoever for the stupid choices that she made. She's going to have to work long and hard to dig herself out of this hole that she created. Demanding that everyone feels sorry for her because she FAFO'd it's just another example of her toxic level of self-centeredness. You don't owe her any apology for telling her the truth. Your parents need to stop indulging this pity party of hers and tell her to grow the F up and take accountability for her own actions.", "Take it back? What is she 12?\n\nHonestly, your parents have my sympathy because they\u2019ve seen one of their children fall from such heights to her current situation.

Not very smart.", "Nta, im sorry but i will never feel bad for anyone who burns their own life to the ground.", "NTA\n\nThe truth hurts. Your sister felt entitled to do whatever she felt like doing, but doesn\u2019t want to deal with the consequences of her actions. She didn\u2019t learn a thing from her experience.", "NTA- someone intelligent enough for an ivy league college and law school should be able to distinguish between being victimized and piss poor decision making.", "NTA - she is an adult who knew exactly what she was doing and the potential consequences.  You are 100% NTA on being sick of her playing the victim card.  Her bed she made - her bed to now lay on.", "NTA, she has no one to blame but herself. She\u2019s made her bed, and now she gets to lie in it. Speaking from someone who used to be like your sister, she knows she screwed up, but won\u2019t take accountability for it. Don\u2019t worry, OP, you have done absolutely nothing wrong here", "Yes, she's at rock bottom.\n\nShe's the one that attached the rock to her foot, and threw it into the lake... dragging her down with it.  She really only has herself to blame, but seems unable or unwilling to admit it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nI find reddit so forgiving to women who fuck up their lives. You bring it up and reddit calls you out? Wants you to be kinder? No way. If she was a he we'd be taking her DOWN TOWN!!!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Some people need to face reality, and some people need to be slapped in the face with it.", "NTA. This didn\u2019t happen all at the same time. If she was caught she had the opportunity to end the affair and get her life in order. To then go to actively becoming an accomplice is completely on her. It\u2019s a deliberate act that she unequivocally know is wrong. She needs to take responsibility or she\u2019ll never get back on track, but it sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to do that.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister was and is an idiot.", "NTA\n\nNo, it needed to be said, these aren't little mistakes, these are major screw ups, so bad that she lost custody of her son.\n\nShe won't ever get him back with attitude like this.", "NTA. She hasn\u2019t hit rock bottom if she\u2019s not trying to crawl out yet.", "NTA. I believe she fucked around and found out'.", "NTA. \u201cOh no!  Not the natural consequences of your actions! How could anyone foresee this happening!\u201d  \n\nAnd not to rush to an idiot\u2019s defense, while she\u2019s made some massive mistakes, keep in mind these criminal dudes can be charming, manipulative, and charismatic and probably told her everything she wanted to hear about herself that no one else had said. I\u2019d probably back off at this point and not mention it further, for everyone\u2019s sake. She\u2019s paid a pretty high price even if her whining isn\u2019t justified and you were fair to call her on it.", ">Even my dad said I could be kinder to her because she's at rock bottom.\n\nI am honestly not sure I would even want to house her. I wouldn't want to continue a sister relationship so I probably wouldn't care if she was upset.

I'm sorry if it's judgemental of me but I would not trust her and I would not want to listen to any of that.\n\nShe's also incorrect. She's lucky she's not also in jail.", "NTA\n\nShe did everything she wasn't supposed to do. She had an affair and got caught and lost everything. SHE was the one who chose to do that. It's no one's fault but herself, so her complaining is completely out of line.", "NTA, your parents are enablers and fostering a victimhood mentality. She did this 100% to herself.

Someone who was readmitted after disbarment would not have a particularly good reputation even if readmitted in this circumstances\u2019 case, so obviously would never again make anywhere near to what she was before.", "Not a lawyer myself but worked with clients who moved to become lawyers again in other states. Just like doctors, you can lose the license or get disbarred in one state and another state may allow you to become a lawyer again. State bar associations can only bar you from practicing law in the state where you work and only if your state lets the bar association work as a monopoly. If the state agrees to the American Bar association rules of conduct then the state might prevent you from practicing law in that state if you are disbarred from another but only 31 states follow the ABA's rules on this. In 19 states and Puerto rico you can be disbarred in another state and still practice in that state or region\n\nYou can get disbarred and become a lawyer again in your own state too, provided you don't bring a cell phone to your criminal boyfriend in prison.

Hiding evidence isn't an issue, that can be considered a lawyers job in some cases. We've helped lawyers get back from both of those. Bringing a cell phone to a prisoner is the issue. \n\nSee, you have to get permission from BOP in your state to access the prison system, you will not be given access if you violate prison rules in any state or federal prison. If you can't gain access to prisons no law office will hire you because every office deals with clients going to jail at some point. A litigator not being able to speak to their client outside of the courtroom would be considered a liability for most law offices which is why they wouldn't hire her. No client would either if they found out she can't go into a prison to discuss their case. We never worked with clients who were disbarred for bringing any type of paraphernalia to a prison unless that lawyer agreed to become a corporate lawyer.

Uuuuuuuuugh that's so nasty \ud83e\udd22", "You are, at least as far as legal ethics goes \ud83e\udd23 \n\nSomeone who\u2019s served a sentence for murder can say they\u2019ve repaid society by doing the time, and that it had nothing to do with their practice as a lawyer. So long as they didn\u2019t murder their client or opposing counsel. \n\nYou use your position as a lawyer to commit a crime/do dodgy financial stuff, you can\u2019t argue it had nothing to do with your fitness to practice.", "Is disbarment a state thing, or is it nationally? I\u2019m confused because I thought lawyers would only practice in states where they passed the bar, or else all attorneys would practice everywhere. So what\u2019s stopping her from passing the bar and practicing in another state?", "No firm is going to want to touch her even if she gets her license back. \n\nDestroying evidence is the key point, it opens the firm up for problems.", "That\u2019s not really correct. I am a lawyer. \n\nNot only do attorneys have to report any misconduct in one jurisdiction to any other they hold a license, I know of not a single jurisdiction that would admit a lawyer on motion or after taking their bar exam who is not eligible to practice in another jurisdiction. \n\nThere is a process called \u201ccharacter and fitness,\u201d and that applies equally to admission on motion and those who\u2019ve taken the bar exam and haven\u2019t been previously licensed. \n\nSo yeah maybe the attorney can pass the bar exam elsewhere, but there is a VERY VERY low chance they\u2019d ever pass character and fitness.", "What exactly did the family therapist do? Doesn\u2019t seem like it helped much. What does she think isn\u2019t her fault exactly? The cheating? The ethical breaches? The criminal actions? She chose to cheat on her husband and have someone else\u2019s kid. She chose to have improper relations with a client, which she had been certainly taught to not do. She chose to smuggle contraband into a freaking prison and violate the sanctity of court processes. \n\nThe consequences add up. I don\u2019t understand how exactly she\u2019s disassociating her culpability from the results of her actions.", "that part.  LMAO  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Disbarment is a state thing, as attorneys have to be licensed in each state they practice in (though there are procedures for temporary admission to practice for a specific case,) and are thus regulated and subject to sanctions for violating professional ethics rules by the specific body governing attorneys in a particular state.  (Varies by state, but often the state's bar association under the supervision of the state's supreme court.)\n\nHowever, there are agreements to impose reciprocal discipline where it comes to attorneys admitted to practice in multiple states and/or before federal courts, where if an attorney is sanctioned for professional misconduct in one state, the other states they are licensed in may impose a similar sanction on that attorney as well (generally cases of suspension, disbarment, and/or resignation in lieu of disbarment.)  IIRC, the sanctioning body will notify the relevant authorities in the other states the sanctioned attorney is known to be licensed in, and the sanctioned attorney may also be under an obligation to notify the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, as well as any other bodies they may be licensed by if it is related to their license to practice law of their being disciplined.\n\nAs for a disbarred attorney attempting to be admitted in another state, among the questions in the application for admission are items asking if one has ever been admitted to practice law before, as well as asking if they've ever been sanctioned for professional misconduct before, which would be checked in a background check of the applicant.  A previously disbarred attorney applying to take the bar exam in another state would likely be rejected on character and fitness grounds, especially if they tried applying before they were cleared to apply for readmission in the state that disbarred them in the first place.", "Her background check will flag", "That\u2019s why you try not to do drugs when practicing law.", "Ah, I miss that show!"]}
