I honestly just popped off about it one day and told him if he does it again, he can sleep at his friend\u2019s place and contribute to their nastiness(disgusting boy house). I also put up a sticky note that says \u201cDOUBLE CHECK TOILET\u201d. Whenever someone asks about the note, I tell them to ask my husband. It\u2019s been 3 months and has only happened once but I gave him a chance bc it\u2019s the day his grandmother died. (I know right?)\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to look at or clean someone else\u2019s shit or shit crumbs if they are not your child. You are not his mother.", "NTA he\u2019s an adult, you\u2019re not his maid! What the hell is wrong with men? To any man reading this, I clean the bathrooms, I clean the floors, I clean the HVAC system, I clean house, do laundry, fold towels, fold her clothes. If you can\u2019t be 100% in to a relationship and keeping house, GROW UP", "NTA 100%. I'm really disgusted with how mothers raised their sons because I feel like they can't pick up after themselves and we are left to mother them. Like, oh hell no, they are grown ! This is not your fault, he needs to grow up because that is so disgusting lol", "NTA.. Hilarious he got embarrassed cause his mom basically called him out for a dirty toilet. Now he blames you?\n\nI guess maybe he learned his lesson and will brush the toilet when he is done.\n\ud83e\udd26", "ESH - this relationship is so toxic and childish. Instead of working this out, you poop in the gym bathroom instead of your own house on the weekends? And it's been that way for a month? How do you write that out and not realize how ridiculous that is?", "NTA.\n\nHis mother should be disgusted at herself for raising a son who doesn't know how to use a toilet brush.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHe's a grown man, FCS.\n\nHe should be able to figure out how to use a toilet brush. It is a matter of personal hygiene.\n\nHe does shower every day, right?\n\nI think it's great that he got caught by his mom. Maybe he is embarrassed enough now to clean up after himself. I would bet she taught him better.\n\nTbh, I don't know if I would want to live with a man who can't take care of his own shit. Literally.\n\nJuck.", "I think you mean disabuse.", "He needs to eat more fiber, Your shit should not be smearing on the back of the toilet", "Maybe MIL can gift him his very own cleaning supplies for Christmas", "It your responsibility, rater than his, to check the house was presentable before his parents arrived!", "And... MIL asked hubby where the cleaning supplies are. Not OP. So, at least MIL figured that her son ought to know, right?!", "Dude, just drop it. You look like a fool trying to defend OP's husband's \\*shitty\\* behavior.   \n\n\nIf the bathroom he uses is gross enough that a guest requested CLEANING SUPPLIES it was gross enough for him to have cleaned it before the guests came over. It is not OP's responsibility.", "I have been pooping my whole life. I have never once gotten it all over anything. How the hell does that even work?", "[deleted]", "I haven't once defended the husband.", "I don't want it on the toilet either. I just don't see the point in making an effort to get rid of a small brown stain on the back of the toilet.  I think your analogy came from not reading what I wrote, but oh well.  I have kids, so cleaning poop and dealing with bodily excretions has been a part of my life for a long time now.  \n\nwe haven't even talked about the water line.. is the poop out of the water or in?  does that make a difference?  \n\nI'm not here to be attacked, or have poor attempts to shame me made.  I have never had a problem with flies in my toilet bowl and I am not repulsed by the look of shit.  If there are no other reasons than poop is bad mmmk then we can agree to disagree and go on with our days.", "so perhaps I am nose blind to it?  that's something to consider..  \n\nI think maybe it doesn't bother me because of my experiences in the military? if you have ever had to poop in a bag, then try and get all the TP into that small bag... that might be the cause.. \n\neither way if your partner is not ok with your cleanliness habits it's best to err on the side of cleaner than not.  I would absolutely clean the bowl everyday if it would make my partner that much happier(or less angry w/e).  \n\nI am not trying to debate or push my way of thinking I thought I did a good job of asking for more information on why most of the people here feel a certain way.", "She didn't clean, though, did she? She successfully embarrassed her kid into handling it with one whispered question. MIL knows how to get things done. Good for her.", "If she knew how to get things done, her disgusting son wouldn't be forgetting to clean his shitty toilet.", "NTA. Fucking gross.", "I wonder how many people read your post while leaving skid marks on the toilet.", "NTA that\u2019s disgusting. He can at least pour some bleach around and flush a couple of times, not that hard \ud83e\udd22", "Nta.  Not ur ass, not your sh1t, not your responsibility", "NTA. Just adding don\u2019t marry this man or have children with him. These types of situations will be exponentially worse with the stress of kids and all the mental load/tasks that requires. If he can\u2019t see he\u2019s a human that is capable of cleaning after himself now during these early \u201choney moon\u201d years it will not ever get better.", "NTA it's his mess so it's his problem. Is he always in such a rush that he forgets to clean the bathroom up after himself? Maybe he is having urgency problems and should see a doctor. Or he is leaving it too long like a child. Not surprising since the rest of his behaviour is childish.", ">Darn it I forgot the important part. The reason he was upset and embarrassed was because his mom asked him where we kept cleaning supplies so she could clean it.\n\nah-hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha\n\nNTA", "NTA. He deserved that.", "Have you told his mom the truth ? Bc I think she should know about him and not think you dirty . She may think like him but as long as she know you not the cause \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f he did it to himself bc I would\u2019ve told his parents at supper", "Ha.  Ha.  Ha.\n\nNTA; thanks for the laugh at him being called out by his mommy.  That crap encrusted toilet was his own doing.  I can't believe he hadn't noticed.", "NTA, this is disgusting.  Did you know this before marrying him.  I don't think i could spend my life with someone who would do that.  I mean that's gross.  How would he like it if you got blood anywhere in the bathroom during that time of the month and didn't clean it.", "NTA. He is a grown ass man and has been made aware of his grossness multiple times. He SHOULD feel all the shame he felt in front of his mom. I live with a roommate and if I get poo on the bowl, I clean it immediately, even if I\u2019m rushing to go to work. I don\u2019t let it stay and cake so you need to spend 5 whole minutes to clean it. Yikes", "NTA.  Love this.  How else does a lesson get taught when not learned by directly telling someone?", "NTA\n\nIt took his mom pointing it out for him to be embarrassed. My husband would be embarrassed for me, his wife, to see that. Because he wants to like to impress me and sleep with me. Why wasn't your husband embarrassed when you pointed it out initially? He thought it was ok for you, the person he wants to love him, to see, so by his logic it must be ok for others. \n\nIf his mom brings it up again, or he does, ask her if this was a problem he had growing up and how you got him to keep the toilet clean. So you are very clear that this is a husband problem, not a you problem. If he keeps it up with blaming you, I'd reach out to MIL and ask for suggested cleaning products and tips.", "NTA but then why did you marry him if he annoys you this much that you come here to whine about your husbands behaviors?\n\nI always see such posts here, partners complaint about other partners. I always wonder about the mystery that why they picked on those people to become partners.\n\nIts appereantly not a small issue, since you guys come here, a social media section with tens of thousands of active roamers, to express how much you dislike partner's X behavior.\n\nThen why, how do you guys put yourselves in such positions to begin with?", "NTA. \n\nInfo: how old is he? As another man I am constantly amazed at how many crybaby men exist out there.", "NTA.\n\nthe reason his mother went directly to him is because she knew from experience who created the shitshow in the toilet - i'm sure he was smearing the toilet of his parent's house too......", "NTA", "NTA, Your husband's consistent neglect to clean up after himself is a clear lapse in personal responsibility", "NTA do you even need to ask? Your husband is an entitled AH and at least he finally realized it needed cleaning", "Hope the widdle boy (husband) will now remember to clean the toilet.\n\nNTA. \n\nHave the in-laws over every week or two weeks to encourage hubby to keep toilet clean", "Nothing turns me on more than when my mummy\u2019s boy husband leaves a bowl full of turd for me to clean.\n\nLove it. Gets my bits all moist.", "NTA. Get him a Tushy on his dime and he can learn. If he can\u2019t clean the toilet, I am scared about the state of his butt or underwear.", "How dare you not clean a known problem you don\u2019t contribute to that you\u2019ve addressed and also come up with a solution to?? Seriously. You Neanderthal. \n\nIn all seriousness is your husband an actual idiot because his mental gymnastics are jaw dropping. NTA. Like WTF did he think was gonna happen?? The poop fairies would visit and bless his toilet bowl? What a moron", ">where we kept cleaning supplies so she could clean it\n\nNTA Yeah, this is exactly why he doesn't clean it. Does he clean any of his other messes?", "Really? She's supposed to remind a grown man that he needs to take care of his own poo poo so mommy won't be cross? If he uses the bathroom, then he should see how it looks. If he's embarrassed, good.", "Very hectic life that he's been taking speed shits for an entire month with no time to clean before rushing to the next urgent mission.", "I ask with no judgement but simple curiosity. Why do you stay with someone like this? How can you love and be intimate with someone who has such habits?\n\nHow is your husband okay with letting you clean up his literal shit?", "I agree with you here. It's possible that her asking him where the cleaning supplies are were a nice way of nudging him to clean up. Based on OP's description, I don't see where she made a fuss and it seems like she may have even realized what was going on and tried to avoid making it OP's problem by going directly to OP's husband for a solution. I'm assuming she realized that the rest of the place was very clean and could put 2 and 2 together.", "Unless he's rubbing his dick in the shitsmear, he's not going to get a UTI from just using a dirty toilet.", "This better be some sort of drinking game where you have to take shots for every 10 downvotes.", "What is your point? He can get out the cleaner and do a deep clean as well. Why is that HER job?"]}
