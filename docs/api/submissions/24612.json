I said I would call his mom and clear up exactly who leaves the toilet like that. \n\nHe said he won't forget again but that I was an ass not to check before we had guests. I told him the truth. I had checked it just wasn't my problem since he had promised that he would not do that any more.

How has no one cleaned the bathroom and the toilet for one month? Whose chore is it to clean the bathroom?\n\nEdit: trying to clarify as people seem to not be getting my point. I'm not justifying the husband not cleaning up after taking a dump. That's disgusting. I'm finding it weird none of them cleaned the bathroom (using cleaning products) in a month. And I asked who was in charge of that task. The husband is an AH. But whoever dad the job of cleaning the bathroom (with cleaning products) is also one (maybe it's the husband, maybe it's OP). And no, OP doesn't have to tell him to clean or be in charge of it. But someone is responsible for it and I'm asking who.", "NTA\n\nHopefully he's learnt his lesson", "NTA.

If he can't get the gist even with instructive videos, and especially if he ever calls you a jerk again, consider rehoming him.", "NTA\n\nI had a roommate before who acted just like that. It's gross.", "Spot on.", "She was asking him where the cleaning supplies are so that she could clean it herself. More than knowing how he can be, I guarantee she is the reason he is the way he is.", "Not everyone has a chore list with their partner!", "I used our bathroom in the bedroom and kept it clean.", "So things just show up clean? Or does no one clean them? I have a cleaning lady and still divide the rest of the chores with my partner: he handles the dishes, I handle the clothes. We both share the meal cooking.", "Again, whose chore is it to keep it clean.\n\nKeeping it clean is not just flushing and using the toilet brush. And you're surely not using cleaning products everytime you take a dump. So whose chore was it to keep the bathroom clean?", "Some people just clean their houses without needing to have a preset list of who does what.

But since, I tell you for the third time, I didn't use it for a moth I didn't clean it.", "You shouldn't just clean it when you see dirt.\n\nI use the toilet brush whenever it's needed.

It doesn't mean it doesn't have to be cleaned, using cleaning products, once a week.", "So you use cleaning products every time you take a dump?\n\nWho cleans the shower? Who cleans the sink? etc\n\nYou're surely not using cleaning products after every usage.", "It's like you don't understand that cleaning (at least once a week, with cleaning products) can also be classified as cleaning when you see dirt. I'm not talking about scrubbing the shit off. I'm talking about general house cleaning. Not everyone needs a schedule and a chore list. Some people just clean their houses.", "OP has explained several times. She uses the ensuite. Her partner uses the main bathroom and doesn't clean it. It is not OP's job to clean up her husband's mess especially when he has said he will do it.", "Are you intentionally being this dense? Plenty of normal, functioning adults are very capable of cleaning without being told to clean - it\u2019s as simple as \u201chey babe, have you cleaned the toilet recently? No? Okay, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d \u201cWelcome home honey! Just to let ya know, I cleaned the kitchen today\u201d - not all couples need a chore list to maintain a household", "Again, I could go a month without cleaning my toilet and I wouldn't see dirt. That doesn't mean it's clean.", "So it was agreed upon that she would be in charge of cleaning the ensuite and him the other one? I don't see that anywhere.\n\nWhat I got from OP's post was that she used to go after him and use the toilet brush to clean his mess and she stopped doing that. But that's not all that it takes to keep a toilet clean.\n\nThat's why I keep asking whose job it was and OP continues diverting the question.", "No one needs to be told.\n\nBut responsibilities need to be discussed. Otherwise it's no one's responsibility.\n\nOf course the husband needs to use the toilet brush and it's his fault it got to that point. I'm not discussing that. I just found it disgusting that no one cleaned the bathroom in one month and was trying to understand why.", "And in response to that I would say that maybe you aren't looking hard enough for dirt. Or maybe you live in a house that doesn't produce dust at all.", "Can you please explain which part of \"we clean up after ourselves\" you are having trouble understanding? I will endeavour to make it easier to comprehend.", "You seem to be of the belief that all cleaning tasks are OPs to either do herself or specifically request her partner to do them. This is not the case. The cleaning of the house is a shared responsibility and OP's partner has eyes in his head. She told him that she was no longer cleaning his shit, he could also see with his own eyes that the bathroom needed cleaning. He chose to do nothing.", "Not every couple needs to have a chore/job list like a bunch of teenagers. If you\u2019ve made a mess after you\u2019ve taken a dump, like OP\u2019s husband clearly often does, it is common courtesy/basic hygiene to *at least* use the toilet brush to make the toilet presentable again. OP\u2019s asked her husband several times to to the literal bare minimum. He is capable of cleaning his own mess up, and he isn\u2019t doing it; eventually she decided to make an example of it and it was well-made.\n\nCleaning up after yourself and doing an actual clean are two different things. If OP\u2019s husband didn\u2019t bother to clean his own mess off a toilet why is it OP\u2019s job? I\u2019m sure that OP would have no issue doing a bathroom clean if her husband didn\u2019t deliberately make it harder for her by consistently leaving his sh\u00a1t crusted to the toilet when he could just *clean it himself* like any responsible hygienic adult. Nobody cleaned the bathroom for a month because OP was trying to make an example out of her lazy husband, and it worked like a charm.\n\nOP, NTA. Well played.", "Why should it be her responsibility to clean a shit crusted toilet she doesn\u2019t use and has repeatedly expressed discontent over?\n\nAnd if not discussing responsibilities makes to no one\u2019s responsibility in your relationship, that\u2019s genuinely concerning - neither of you have the basic initiative to clean something that hasn\u2019t been cleaned for a while?", "The toilet is one of the least dusty places in the whole house. And again, cleaning dust doesn't keep a toilet clean.\n\nIf you only clean when you see dust you're cleaning too late.", "I clean after my self. I flush and if I take a dump I use the toilet brush. When I'm brushing my teeth and toothbrush falls in the sink I clean it up. If I spill something I clean it up. That's what I call cleaning after myself.\n\nThat's not all that's needed to keep things clean.", "No, I'm not. That's why I'm asking whose chore it is. If it's agreed that she cleans the bathrooms, then she should have cleaned it even if she doesn't use it. If it's agreed that he cleans the bathrooms it should be him. If it's agreed that each of them cleans one bathroom then it should have been him.\n\nOP doesn't need to ask or command. But it needs to be specified otherwise it's no one's responsibility.", "I fully agree with the first paragraph and would the first sentence of the second. That sentence is precisely why I'm asking this.\n\nI never said it was OP's job, I didn't even hint at it. The husband is an AH for not cleaning up after himself. But I found it odd (and disgusting) that no one has deep cleaned the bathroom in a month and was wondering about who should have done it.\n\nLet's assume the husband did what every decent human being does, which is to use a toilet brush. Would the bathroom not have been deep cleaned for a whole month because you couldn't see the shit?", "She doesn't have to clean up after him.\n\nBut that's not all that's entailed in keeping a house clean.", "I clean my bathroom every week. There is always some dirt/dust. I don't believe that when you clean your bathroom weekly there is no actual dirt to be cleaned.", "He has eyes", "I can\u2019t put words in OP\u2019s mouth but I would assume that the bathrooms and the rest of the house are regularly cleaned, but she decided to make an example out of this bathroom since she had repeatedly asked her husband to clean his mess off the toilet and he didn\u2019t. If OP had purposefully decided *not* to clean this bathroom, then it\u2019s a reasonable assumption to make that she usually does clean the bathroom and has just reached the end of her tether because her husband is being a dirty pig.\n\nIt is everyone\u2019s responsibility to keep a house clean if they live in it. OP had repeatedly asked her husband to clean his crusty mess off the toilet and he didn\u2019t. How many more times is she supposed to repeat herself before she decides to try something else, in this case, simply *not* cleaning up after him to teach him a lesson?", "In order to deep clean that bathroom she would have to deal with his crusty skid marks - we were specifically discussing whose responsibility it is to clean that toilet, and I think it\u2019s silly to even ask that question when OP has been so clear about their disgust at the situation"]}
