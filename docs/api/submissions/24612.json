Explain exactly what happened and why. Maybe even apologize that she had to see that, but you relied on your husbands word that he would clean up after himself. \n\nUnfortunately, people still tend to blame women for the state of a household. Even if it was your husbands job to clean, in their eyes it was your job to make sure he did it. \n\nI also suspect this is just the tip of the iceberg, so just in case I'll leave these links tjat live permanently in my cache.\n\n[You should\u2019ve asked](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/)\n\n[She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes By The Sink](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/she-divorced-me-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink_b_9055288)\n\n[Women Aren't Nags\u2014We're Just Fed Up.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)\n\nhttp://oliver-uploads-aus.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/05/09/08/10/35/535/WORK180_Family_Chores_Checklist.pdf", "He had to shower and change his clothes?

You're his wife, not his maid.  I admit I forget to do a LOT of stuff around the house.  That being said when my wife calls me on it I seldom complain or gripe.  I just do what she asks me to do because she's not my maid.  I was raised by a single mom until age 13, then had a stepdad who worked out of town a lot so it was almost like being raised by a single mom when he was gone.  I did all the 'guy stuff' around the house (Took out the trash, cut the lawn, etc.) and when my mom asked me to clean out the main bathroom I was usually the one who did the toilets.  My sister did most of the 'girl stuff' but I had to help with that sometimes too.", "NTA.\n\nNot a spouse but a roommate, was exactly the same. She would leave trash piled in her bathroom, which was the 'main' bathroom that guests would use when they came over since I had the master bedroom with my own bathroom. She would leave her dirty clothes on the floor, leave her sink a mess, she also had cats so there would be litter scattered everywhere. It got to the point where if I had guests I would tell them to use my bathroom through my room so they wouldn't have to use hers. I would flat out refuse to help her clean it and she would get embarrassed when people came over and said the bathroom was messy/dirty/smelled, etc. I would straight up tell them, 'well that's so-and-so's bathroom, I don't use it so I don't clean it' and she would be livid.
