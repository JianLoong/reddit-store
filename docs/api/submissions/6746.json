Start calling them before you go to bed to talk about your day. When they complain about being woke up tell them what time it is where you are and how it isn't that late. Ask if they think sleep is more important than sharing a conversation with you. Extra points if you have a silly/simple problem that you just want to talk about.\n\nA few times of being woke up may cure them.", "NTA  your mom and sister need to grow up and realize not everything revolves around them", "NTA. My petty self would make a point to call them at 3am every night until they got the point.", "NTA. Silence your phone until you wake up.", "NTA. Your sister is not your responsibility.", "NTA.\n\nHere's a life tip:  Ignore anyone who uses the term \"selfish\" in reference to you not doing whatever it is that they want you to do.  It's one of those stupid mealymouthed words like \"inappropriate\" or \"tacky\" that people use when they can't otherwise think of an actual reason you're doing it wrong.", "NTA", "NTA.  Turn your phone off when you don't want calls.  They can just leave a message.  Call them back 100am their time.", "NTA. Most of my family live in a time zone two hours earlier than mine. Even with my mom, who is an early bird, I try to be very aware of what time it is there anytime I call in the morning. Likewise, my family is aware that my kids' bedtimes start at 8pm, which means they shouldn't call after 6pm their time--unless it's an emergency, of course.\n\nYou have set your boundaries. They are reasonable and necessary for you to be able to get enough rest so you can support yourself and live a good life. You are not selfish for caring about your own well-being.", "NTA of course you aren\u2019t. They were extremely inconsiderate and way out of line here. Unfortunately it sounds like your gonna have to set some boundaries and at first that probably won\u2019t go over well, but people eventually get used to being told no if it happens enough.", "Call them at a convenient time for you and one that\u2019s inconvenient for them. Repetitively until they\u2019re willing to schedule calls that are reasonable for everyone", "NTA. Time to put do not disturb on your phone. \n\nI will say that as someone who has lived all over the world though, it\u2019s not uncommon for friends/family \u201cback home\u201d who have never dealt with time difference to seem completely incapable of understanding when is or isn\u2019t an appropriate time to call. So DND is a huge help.", "NTA.\n\nthis is bizarre. honestly I'd be a little upset myself if they got all bothered because I told them not to call me at 6am. not sure why they feel so entitled here, maybe because their family, but that doesn't give them the green light to call you at unusual hours for a procedure that's happening that you provide no value over.  getting your wisdom teeth pulled is not extremely invasive (you do get put under though.) and is pretty common these days around that age. I had mine pulled at 16 and I wasn't calling everyone to have them wish me well, that's ass backwards.\n\nHopefully you get the sleep you need!", "NTA, when I was working night shift I'd have to sleep during the day while my child was at school, but I'd keep the ringer on in case of emergency or if the school called. Everyone in my family knew when I'd be asleep and would only call or text me after 3pm when they knew I'd be awake. Your family is totally capable of understanding the concept, I guess they'd just prefer not to. They could've called you the night before if your sister needed support or a pep talk, or even asked you to text her a nice encouraging message to wake up to.", "You need to step up more on the do not disturb. Please explain this to your boss if you have to. If he's calling you at 6:00 a.m., he is TA also.", "Go ahead and set your alarm for 5:00 am their time.

I work swing shift and my phone does not make a sound when I'm sleeping. I gave everyone calendars of my shift schedule but I still get calls and texts asking what shift I'm on lmao", "You don't wake people up with a phone call unless it's an emergency. Just turn your ringer off, OP. Tell your sister you're teaching her a valuable lesson about boundaries. \n\nNTA\n\nEditing to add: if 6am calls are cool, so are 2am calls.

My mom is in hospice now and could take that final bad turn at any time. Also I am the second person to be notified in case the nursing home cannot reach my father. If my mother needs to go to the hospital which has happened numerous times, I have had to give permission for blood transfusions ,endoscopies to replace her feeding tube, etc. as well. I come from a large family and I am the oldest sibling of six ,well five now that my brother took his own life. But I have had several calls from my other brother when his dogs were very ill at 3 AM and I literally jumped out of bed and drove to the emergency vet, so I could help take care of things because he was an emotional mess. I have numerous nieces and nephews, and even a great nephew. I would hate not being there if someone needed me. And since I worked in healthcare for 25 years, I am usually the person that they seek advice from when someone is sick, although now, my youngest sister is a nurse and is starting to know what I have had to live with.\nAll that being what it is, I am currently on permanent disability from work with multiple illnesses and very much not a morning person. My family and friends for the most part respect that and don\u2019t call me before noon unless it\u2019s something very important or if I tell them to . And back when I was a travel, sonographer, working all over the United States, including Alaska I dealt with time zone changes and different work shifts all the time. I always made sure that my family knew my schedule, and that if my phone was turned off. It was because I was sleeping Due to taking call. I had one of the funniest messages from my brother playfully, cussing me out because he couldn\u2019t reach me for three days trying to wish me a happy birthday. I think most people can be reasonable if things are laid out for them in the simplest fashion.

You\u2019re definitely not the asshole.", "Thank you. My point, was that my friends and family know not to call me at inappropriate hours unless there is a true emergency.

Pretty please!", "multiple times i\u2019ve told them not to call me before 12pm on their time. she said i need to be there for. like talk to her ? idk but it\u2019s not my issue that she\u2019s getting her wisdom teeth out. not a reason to call me at 6am"]}
