It's not the end of the world for her, she can just rinse her clothes again and then find an available dryer to use.  Or be nice and respectful to you and get to use the dryer again.\n\nBut it's probably better to make peace here since you don't want tampering with your dryer while you are gone.  Maybe she can pay you to use it to defray costs?", "NTA, your dryer your rule.", "NTA.\n\nThat's like asking to use something of hers, she says no, and you do it anyway, repeatedly. \n\nSounds like you're gonna need to take the whole cord every time you're done with you laundry now.", "\"If you want to use someone else's stuff, you need to ask them for permission\". It's not a complicated concept. NTA", "NTA - the first time she used it was a misunderstanding, but everytime after that made her a bigger and bigger AH", "NTA - You told her No more than once.", "NTA\n\nNew neighbor is an opportunistic jerk. Keep that plug.\n\nAlso, you may need to deodorize your dryer.", "NTA, just wow!!  she was so rude.", "NTA\n\nL is entitled, petty and rude. In other words a real AH.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if your dryer ends up damaged. I might even set up a camera of some sort.", "NTA.\n\nShe f\\*cked around, she found out. \n\nBeware of retaliation though, I'm guessing she's the petty type.", "NTA.", "If it's a pain to remove the cord each time, OP should be able to find a locking plug cover that would prevent use.", "OP stayed the washers and dryers were in a communal area, so setting up a camera might be problematic.", "Nanny cams can be easily hidden and discreet.", "NTA but you need to let your landlord know of the incident.  Just do it as an FYI, not as seeking anything.  This way if something happens to the dryer, you have a documentation trail that will support your position.", "Most plugs have a hole in the wide side of the prongs.  Get a small padlock and attach it so the plug can not be plugged in. Take the key when you go to do your clothes. \n I used to snowplow my 80+ year old windowed neighbour's driveway.

She is not entitled to use your dryer, and it's really rude that she is acting like she has the right to do so. \n\nBut now I would be afraid that she will sabotage your dryer in some way, like hide a lipstick, some bugs, or some bleach in it. There are a lot of creative ways to mess with you.\n\nJust so you don't have to watch your back forever, it would be in your best interest to resolve this issue with her and clear the air. Like sell her half your dryer and agree that each of you use your own outlet.", "NTA she can buy a 20 drying rack or clothes line if she can\u2019t afford a dryer. She is an entitled AH and has no business using yours.", "NTA Removing the cord and leaving her wet stuff there was just the right reaction, imho. I probably would've removed the wet stuff and dumped it in front of her door, but I'm a massive asshole, lol.", "NTA, she was basically stealing from you even after you repeatedly told her to stop.", "NTA. You had an exchange of goods / services with the prior tenant. First time she used your dryer may have been a mistake, but every other time since has been them not respecting your boundaries or your stuff. I agree with another comment that talked about mentioning this exactly as you\u2019ve described it here to your landlord. Even if you only attach the cord when you use it, you run the risk of them pulling out your wet clothes, drying theirs, and then them leaving your clothes to molder. Or they\u2019ll damage the dryer out of spite in an \u201cif I can\u2019t use it, neither of us get to use it\u201d abuser mindset. If they can\u2019t abide by a new contract where you negotiate the use of your dryer on their electricity for some goods or services on their side of the bargain, that\u2019s on them.\n\nEdited to add: If your landlord is willing and / or the former tenant is still in contact with you and is a friend of new tenant, have them explain the entirety of the prior contract. You could also or instead write a very carefully worded handwritten note in a non-blaming, non-passiveaggro, non-aggro, non confrontational manner explaining the above, run it by your landlord, let them have a copy, make a copy for yourself, and then formally mail it to her instead of doing something like slipping it under her door.

And thank you for the gleeful karma justice giggle I got from reading that you took the whole cord with you, because the whole time I was reading it was mentally wanting there to be a easy you could **make** her stop.\n\nCuriosity: you mention being plugged into your outlet--is that how the cost is charged? Does that mean someone else can plug into your outlet with their machine and you end up paying for their use?", "Removing the cord was brilliant!", "NTA\n\nShe is not entitled to your property. Screams or not.", "can you shorted the mains lead so it wont reach her outlet?", "Wll to dry this one, NTA.  \nIt's YOUR dryer, not hers. YOU can tell who can use it and who can not.

She was already not asking permission in the first place. She can just use someone else\u2019s dryer without permission.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to be nice. She ignored you. This was the perfect solution.", "NTA.  She didn't ask & you told her no multiple times.  She continued to use the dryer at her own risk.  What you did was send a clear message that she is not to use your dryer.  It's really sad that all she had to do was ask, but instead she thinks she's entitled to it.", "NTA\n\nInstead of taking the cord each time, put a lockout canister over the plug to prevent unwanted usage. Put a lock on the canister and problem solved.", "NTA That is a very odd setup, but you don't use something that doesn't belong to you unless you get permission.", "NTA. She didn't get the message. Now you have to keep the cord in your apartment because she's entitled", "NTA. You asked her multiple times not to do it.", "I\u2019d of chucked her clothes in the yard after the first warning but hey, that\u2019s me!

If it is, can you just reattach the cord when you need it and take it with you when finished? I\u2019m sorry your new neighbor is a putz. NTA", "NTA, I did this but with a cord to a pinball machine in a college common room where people were trying to study for finals.", "op-=nta\n\nYou were much more patient than I would be.\n\nShe was told NO, she kept stealing use of dryer and on YOUR dime(electrical).\n\nYour friends are WRONG, she was at fault, not you.", "NTA\n\nShe doubled down after being caught.

And realistically I would have no place to hide a camera in that room.", "I let him know, just in case. But he essentially said he doesn't give a fuck since it's my own personal property and if anything were to happen to it, there's absolutely no way of proving it was her anyways. \n\nI doubt she'll actually do something to my dryer though but I'm insured anyways, so even if she's going to tamper with my dryer, my insurance will likely pay.", "Yes, you plug your washer and dryer into assigned outlets so that the electricity can be calculated individually.\n\nTheoretically you could plug your washer and dryer into other people's outlets, but this system is incredibly common in Germany and I've absolutely never had an issue with it, nor have I ever heard of anybody having an issue with it.", "Wow, that's a thing?!? I really was wondering how to lock up the dryer \ud83d\ude04\nLearn something new everyday!", "Sadly those don't work for the types of outlets we have in the basement. I've also never had an issue with her using my outlet for her washer though, and since I rarely use my dryer anyway, I'll just keep the cord in my apartment. Hopefully she doesn't unplug my dryer next time I'm drying my clothes though ..", "problem is the woman COULD buy a compatible cord and use OP's dryer without permission(on op's outlet).", "Yeah, definitely nix the camera idea then. You would be better off going about this through your super/landlord and possibly asking for cameras to be installed that way where everyone knows they are there if you don\u2019t trust your neighbor.", "Nice landlord. I'm sorry that you have to put up with that type of crap!", "Thanks for those details! It's the first time I've heard of it so I'm fascinated.", "Yep.

She's pretty young and this is her first ever apartment alone straight out of high school. I informed my landlord, but since it's my own personal dryer he obviously doesn't give a shit. But again I really don't think she's going to do anything tbh", "Understood, but there could be a potential legal liability of setting one up in a communal area.", "Not sure if that exact one would work with the shape of a dryer plug, but it gives you the general idea.", "COOL! Now I need to find something to lock.......jk, I just like interesting gadgets", "That is epic. I love that it's red and official looking. That's really going to piss her off.", "Also doesn't work with the type of plugs we have in Germany", "I mean, it\u2019s a pretty bold move to not only use someone else\u2019s dryer multiple times after bing told no but then to scream at the owner because her clothes now smell after using the dryer she wasn\u2019t supposed to be using in the first place? This girl sounds like a real piece of work. Hopefully she just backs off and you don\u2019t have any future issues with her.", "This is true and a good point. Best option would be to go straight to super/landlord.", "Oh definitely and I was pretty shocked to see her blow up like that ngl. But still.

Yes, this!", "NTA, You gave her more then enough warning. It is all her fault that her clothes stink. Your friends need a dose of reality.", "Hahaha brilliant! As I was reading I was hoping for something like \"pulled her half-done clothes out and left them on the dirty floor\" but removing the cord is so much better!!\n\nNTA, she needed to learn.", "NTA\n\nNot going to lie, I would be tempted to plug into her outlet when I was drying my clothes to even things out on the expense side.", "Not only using the dryer, but using her electricity, she has some nerve I would be more than mad I would've thrown her clothes on the floor", "Get a lock for your dryer where the socket goes in and only you have the lock", "I would have thrown her clothes in the dumpster.", "Lock the plug up, gat a lock on Amazon\u2026had to do this with a tenant and worked like a charm", "NTA.\n\nI'd have tossed her clothes on the ground after the first time of being told no.

I would have Brooke\u2019s no nonsense and removed the plug the first time I caught her. \n\n\nCaution though. You need to find away to put a lock on the cord opening bc she seems the type that will simply go buy her own cord to plug into your dryer.", "I was incredibly confused why you wouldn't have communal appliances, but \"Germany\" is sufficient explanation for that.\n\nAnyway, your machine, I assume your plug means you get charged for utilities. She does not inherit the deal your neighbor had, especially without offering anything in return, and she should never have been using it without permission. Please speak to your landlord about her behavior.\n\nNTA", "NTA, she found that taking the piss has consequences, just get her to wash her clothes again and dry in her house", "Hell no, NTA, not even a little bit!!  \nThree strikes and you're out! She was told 3 times that it's not OK to use your dryer. She has no respect for your property and no boundaries. You gave her plenty of chances to get it right!! I would have pulled the plug the second time I caught her!!", "NTA. I thought what you did was VERY appropriate.\n\nI would only plug in the dryer when you want to use it and take the plug with you when finished.\n\nYou could of moved the plug so all dryer loads are on her plug but then she could hold that against you.\n\nBTW - next time anyone puts clothes in your dryer, take them out wet and put them on their washer, as I don't know if the mildew will affect your dryer. (Just in case you leave your plug behind.)\n\nI also recommend that you update the landlord by email (in writing).", "Absolutely NOT the AH. When you told her the 1st time it was not ok she took it upon herself to use it again without asking. So you did right remove the cord \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Problem solved", "NTA. What\u2019s absurd is her using it at all after the first time.", "I would 100% report this to the landlord as well. \"I had an amicable arrangement with the prior tenant where I allowed her to use my dryer (plugged into her outlet) in exchange for goods (vegetables) and services (watering plants).

When I removed the cord to prevent her from using it without permission she aggressively pounded on my door and screamed at me.\"\n\nAlso, you've got to leave wet clothes in there for a while for them to start smelling bad, you would think that if you're using someone else's appliance without permission you would promptly remove your clothes after the cycle was completed.", "I think she's lucky her clothes weren't dumped on the floor still wet.
