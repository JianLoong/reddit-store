You probably will not need to worry about hosting any more pesky Super Bowl parties! Bad New! YTA. Was this really the hill to die on? Is there a huge back story of toxic behavior that you are not sharing? Enjoy your house rules!", "YTA.

What if the game went into OT?", "Is this really real?  \n\nI mean seriously you\u2019re not letting family into your house because they didn\u2019t communicate?

It\u2019s a Super Bowl party most start earlier than 5pm\u2026 so 5pm seems like an obvious time to come.", "YTA. Yes, showing up an hour early was rude. But you overreacted. You should have let them in and then done whatever you were going to do during that hour anyway, which I\u2019m assuming didn\u2019t include making mad, passionate love to your husband on the living room couch. You were under no obligation to entertain them, but threatening them with the police was really over the top.", "Yikes really going to call the police on your family bec they showed up 1 lousy earlier and wouldnt leave\u2026 you are repulsive, 45 is cold , I wouldnt have come back either or ever again for that matter\u2026 YTA\n\njeez they could have helped you out or just sat in the living room or whatever and waited for you to be ready\u2026", "YTA. Firstly, 45 degrees is cold. Secondly, yes they arrived a little early but you were anticipating company and it was your family. I can see being annoyed by the inconvenience but to refuse to let them in and threaten to call the cops on them unless they leave and come back an hour later is WILD.", "YTA lol tf did I just read? I can't believe your husband was fine with calling the cops on his own parents and brother for showing up an hour early. Could they not just stay in the living room while you got ready?

They shouldn't have come early with no warning, but that seemed like one hell of an over reaction.", "YTA. Do you really have to ask?", "YTA when you write \u201cwhat time will you be coming?\u201d It sounds like the time is flexible, so theres no reason to believe you will kick them out for arriving early. Further, you could\u2019ve easily invited them in to help you get ready or entertain themselves until you are ready. What are you setting up that they cant be there to witness it? The fact you even posted this is mind-boggling to me. You think there is some world where you are not the AH? Yeah I guess they inconvenienced you by not communicating well? You could\u2019ve told them you were worried and next time they should respond to your text. Thats all you need to say?", "YTA. Your reaction was over the top given the situation. No, it wasn\u2019t ideal that they showed up an hour early. instead of kicking them out, you could\u2019ve easily invited them in and ask them to help you set up for the party.", "YTA\n\nThis is incredible dumb.

For anyone.\n\nSure they were inconsiderate not getting back to you - but you went way past Over the Top here. \n\nThat's just not okay.  That's a relationship ender-right there.\n\nOne of those stories that will be told at family gatherings (That you aren't at) for years.  \n\nI am going to ask - Was there alcohol involved? because if so - get yourself to an AA meeting. You need to before you pile drive more relationships into the ground. (This is not how you treat family).  And while I don't like their lack of consideration for you? Wow. Your response was postal.\n\n45 degrees is cold enough to have to sit in a running car.  Does that seem feasible to you?  When there's a house you're going to be hosted in - in an hour. This is when you ask everyone to go sit in the living room - with the TV on some channel - while you finish prep..", "I\u2019d say YTA, but this can\u2019t possibly be real, right?", "Threatening to call the cops seems way over the top. Seems like there\u2019s a way bigger issue going on here then your MIL and BIL showing up an hour early. But I guess if that is the only case. YTA. It was an hour early, it\u2019s your MiL and BIL. You knew they were carpooling so you had some type of communication knowing they were coming, just not the specific time?", "YTA. I'm glad they don't speak to you. I think you should be around as few people as possible. An hour early isn't that big of a deal. You WAY overreacted.", "YTA:  \nJust what would it have harmed to let them in? This is not a Victorian uppercrust event. It's a game. They could have sat on the couch and been out of the way, but WARM.   \n\n\nSo pretentiious", "YTA and it sounds like you're leaving out a lot of context. You were going to call the cops over family you invited over showing up an hour early? Really?", "ESH, but mostly you and your husband.\n\nShould they have shown up an hour early without warning? No.\n\nShould you have told them to go away or you would call the cops? Obviously not! What kind of psycho are you that you would treat family like that? Your response was completely out of proportion.", "YTA and it's wildly alarming you have to even ask", "YTA. I mean, an hour earlier and you threatened to call the police on them? You have OCD? Or another kind of neuroatipical thing? Or maybe you are just rude and an AH, I wouldn't hold my breath for the invitation for the next family gathering. Wow just wow.", "YTA. What type of family get together do you have if family doesn\u2019t show up early and late. The parents with younger kids sometimes show up early so they aren\u2019t late. Can you even call it a get together or a gathering if someone doesn\u2019t show up early? Now I bet if they showed up 30 minutes late or 15 minutes late you would have been mad and went off on them. No one shows up at the exact time you say.

If they don\u2019t like that then it\u2019s their choice not to come in; but going all \u201cmy house my rules\u201d on them about something this minor is just spoiling for a fight. They\u2019re perfectly right to stay away after tant, you made it very clear that the entire evening was going to be uncomfortable for them.", "Wow you are 100% TA here. Why act so childish. Just let them inside.", "YTA. Damn. No gatherings at your house. Petty AF level 100.", "YTA. \n\nWas 34 a typo?", "Yta for overreacting", "YTA.  Let them in and make them sit by themselves until you\u2019re ready.  Normally I\u2019d say E S H but honestly you\u2019re super unflexible and causing a problem when none needed to exist", "Yeah unless there is some insane reason why this is not ok in your situation, Yta.  \n\nI\u2019ll be surprised if they return ever", "Call the police? You\u2019re not only the AH you\u2019re a menace.", "Yta \n\nWhy exactly couldn't they relax in your house while you got ready?", "Eh, YTA. This is extreme behavior.", "YTA. You told them the party started at 6, they got there at five. I see you didn\u2019t mention sending an RSVP..so technically they don\u2019t have to text and tell you anything. And you\u2019re being a complete jerk and so is your husband. YOU THREATENED YOUR FAMILY WITH THE COPS BECAUSE THEY WERE ONE HOUR EARLY!! Talk about making a mountain out of a molehill. I wouldn\u2019t have come back either!", "ESH.   You were going to CALL THE POLICE?!?!   Yeh, they may be AH's for the lack of communication but you were a total AH in how you guys reacted.   It's freaking family coming over to watch football.   You all need to get over yourselves.", "YTA\n\n45 is cold first of all\n\nBut also why not just let them in, what difference did the hour make? You were going to call the police because they came an hour early? WHY ask them what time they were coming if you didn't want people before 6? You should have just said \"See you at 6 when the party starts.\"", "YTA. Now they should\u2019ve responded to your text message to let you know when they were arriving, but they arrived just an hour early and it\u2019s not like you weren\u2019t expecting guests. Also, a little bizarre how you wanted to them to them to go to a restaurant to eat for an hour, isn\u2019t the point of inviting people to watch the game and enjoy some food? What did you need to do for the hour to prepare?", "YTA. and so is your husband.  a whole hour early and you threatened to call the cops on your own family?  yikes.", "Yta", "YTA. It\u2019s family.", "An hour early isn't that bad, if they wanted to come early then it sounds like they volunteered to help finish with set up, IMO. \n\nYTA", "YTA.

I would be pissed that people showed up an hour early. It\u2019s rude AF. I don\u2019t care who you\u2019re related to, my house is my house. I don\u2019t want you parking your ass on my couch while I\u2019m in the shower or doing last minute things. It\u2019s rude as hell.  My house is not an extension of my relative\u2019s house. If you\u2019re given a time to come over, that\u2019s when you show up. Otherwise you\u2019re the AH.", "I know that.  The lack of ability to use metric measurements is precisely why I never hire US citizens. Nothing like having years of research ruined by feet and inches.", "Yes. I know that.  It's obvious it's F. But their complete inability to notate the temperature properly,  or even realise the rest of the world doesn't use such archaic measurements is funny.", "My point is that what is cold to you is not cold to me. To focus on that one point as completely absurd is to assume everyone everywhere experience weather the same way. \n\nThe most obvious other example is if you go to Florida in January/February when it\u2019s 60-70 outside. The locals are bundled in parkas and the tourists from up north are swimming in the Gulf of Mexico.", "Hey I think u/SCCLBR is picking a fight with you.", "Hey I think u/dreamqueen9103 is picking a fight with you.", "Not really. The temperature was notated correctly. We use Fahrenheit and so, 45\u00b0 Fahrenheit is chilly. Your comment was actually irrelevant because your temperature is measured in Celsius and thus you\u2019re talking about over 100\u00b0F which again is completely irrelevant to Americans discussing cold weather. If you KNEW we are talking about 45\u00b0F then why would you go in about how hot that is? And then your response is to call Americans stupid for using a system that we\u2019ve all been taught because we have no say over what our country chooses to use as their system of measurement \ud83e\udee0 Bffr.", "Fuck no. This is a gross misuse of police resources. In your case it sounds like your family was threatening you. That is cause to call the cops. An hour early to a party? Many cops would cite the person calling for wasting their time. \n\nI don't think anyone here is saying there's never cause to call the cops on family. This ain't it."]}
