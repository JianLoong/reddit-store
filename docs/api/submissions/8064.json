As the cashier, I need to be in constant view of the register so I am usually the first to see customers and pets enter the store. Occasionally we will have a customer in the store with an off-leash dog or a young reactive puppy when a customer with a service dog comes in. I try to be very concise with service dog users in our store as a person with disabilities myself. That being said I've made a habit of informing any service dog users who come in at the same time as the above-mentioned dogs just to be on the safe side in case the other dog becomes reactive to the service dog and the user feels their dog could be unable to properly & safely perform its tasks in that situation. \n\nThe incident: I was at the register as usual when a lovely couple came in with a young puppy who was on a very long leash came in. I gave my normal welcome and gave a treat to the puppy who was noticeably all over the place and extremely hyper. About 5min after a service dog user (SU) around my age entered the store and the conversation went like this \n\nMe- \u201cHello welcome to (place I work)! is there anything I can help you find tonight?\u201d \n\nSU- \u201cno I'm fine\u201d \n\nMe- \u201cOkie Dokie! Oh just to let you know there are currently other dogs in the store\u201d \n\nSU- in a very sharp tone \u201cYEAH MY DOG IS WELL BEHAVED THANKS\u201d \n\nI didn't say anything to that because I was caught off guard. A bit later the couple and the SU ended up checking out at the same time and the SU was in line directly behind the couple. Well, the puppy started to bark and lung at the service dog trying to play. So despite only having 3 customers in line I called for register backup to help defuse the situation. When the SU heard me call for backup she sighed in a very loud annoyed way. Once backup arrived the SU walked over and slammed her items onto the counter of the backup cashier and told him to hurry up. she was buying a bag of 50lb dog food as well so per policy he asked her if she wanted any help loading the items. SU then yelled \u201cWOW DO YOU REALLY THINK I NEED HELP?!\u201d Scoffed and then left.\n\nI feel like SU was being extremely rude to me and my coworker and it was uncalled for. But I\u2019ve been reflecting on it and I\u2019ve started to wonder if I instigated this situation by acknowledging the fact that she had a service dog and she felt insulted.

This lady was just plain rude!", "Not the asshole, literally did nothing outside of your job description and got yelled at before your could finish a warning so that THEY can stay safe. Rude customer who assumes the worst of others and is unnecessarily reactive, ironically like a rabid dog. She should learn from her service animal.", "You\u2019re NTA, she was rude. She made an assumption in you telling her about the other dogs that her dog might misbehave. She had no reason to jump that conclusion and she carried on the perceived slur through checkout. That\u2019s all on her. You did the right thing in my opinion.", "NTA. You were being courteous and considerate.", "NTA Some people use their disability as an excuse to be an asshole. It is not a valid excuse. SU behaved very rudely. Don't sweat it, but you need to talk to someone at corporate to tell them their policies need to be tightened up. Dogs MUST be on a lead and the lead cannot be extended longer than five feet to protect ALL the customers. \n\nThe way you are warning service dog owners seems TO ME really unfair because service dogs are some of the BEST behaved dogs. They have YEARS of training and are trained not to react to humans or pets while at work. It's the people with dogs on the 30' retractable leads and off leash dogs that you need to be talking to, because THEIR DOG is MORE likely to create a problem, not the service dog...so singling out the disabled people seems like a shitty way of dealing with ALL THE OTHER DOGS THAT potentially could MISBEHAVE. \n\nYou don't punish the polite child for his rude brother do you?", "NTA, but I do wonder why your warning about the other dog is only given to service dog owners. They are the one's who would need it the least.

But you\u2019re specifically targeting customers with service dogs\u2026  \n\nYou\u2019re treating disabled customers as if *their* dog is the one that is the problem (\u201ctheir dog could be unable to properly & safely perform its tasks).  You\u2019re also acting as if the customer doesn\u2019t realize that a pet-friendly store will have pets in it, and they (but not other customers) need to be warned.", "SU was rude.  But they may have a personality disability as well or just at their limit for people that day, which as a servixe dog owner myself happens literally in 5 min because my dog is apparenly so cute that rules don\u2019t apply to people and I can\u2019t get to what I need because literally it\u2019s a constant conversation I don\u2019t want to have all the way there. \n\nSo I agree with you they were rude.  They may also be experiencing intolerable side effects or fatigue and just trying to do their best to get home before a melt down or things other than you.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to you by any means.  But you in my mind were not the problem. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t offer the help per store policy you could have issues from your boss or issues from someone who falls or injured themselves. \n\nTry to let it go.  People in general suck.  But if I say that about a person with a disability then I get buckets of hate.  Just know those people are under a lot of pressure and a lot of hurdles and the steam release sometimes is unfortunate timing.\n\nEdit NTA", "My wife has a service dog, so I have seen the struggles of having one firsthand. Let me say NTA. Maybe they were having a bad day or something,  but you did nothing wrong.", "This is precisely how many divisions between groups of people are made worse.  She was looking for offense and honestly believed she found it, at least twice just in your one store. It would be great if we could all take a breath.  NTA", "NTA, but it sounds like OP failed to pick up on some cues from the customer that self reliance was a big sticking point for this customer and they didn't appreciate the gestures of assistance.  That said, with people that prickly they can also go off when NOT asked if they need help, so I won't fault OP for going the route of offering help (within their professional bounds) and being courteous.", "YTA, but lightly and your heart was in the right place.\n\nWhile what you were doing was to you issuing a fair warning and wanting to be helpful, what you and many others do not realize is how infantilizing these kinds of interactions can feel. People with disabilities are constantly being approached by (well meaning) strangers and assumed they need help, they need warned, they need monitored. A wheelchair user entering a large airport \"needs\" warned and assisted and doted on despite knowing exactly what they're getting into when going to an airport. A Service Dog user \"needs\" warned that there are other dogs in the pet-friendly store she willingly walked into, \"needs\" rescuing from the puppy engaging with their service animal, \"needs\" assistance with their purchase. This is not their first day out in public either, this is every day, for their entire life. You are not the first person to look at them and try to help them do an activity they were already well prepared in advance for.\n\nIf a disabled person needs help or is uncomfortable, they will ask.\n\nWas she a bit curt the first time she said she was fine? Perhaps, but I dont think she's an asshole when I'm sure the first thing people see when they see her is her service dog. Again, it's likely not the first time someone assumed she and her dog needed special consideration.\nDo I think you were wrong in offering the advice the first time she walked in? Not really, though I would say if you are concerned only for Service Animals and not the safety of other people, animals, and children, I would personally vouch for enforcing the leash law within the store for everyone's sake.\nI think the part where YTA comes when you assumed she did not have the situation under control, panicked, called for help, and continued to try and offer assistance when she made it repeatedly clear she did not want any.\n\nAgain, I don't think you're an asshole as a person for this, just many many people don't realize just how capable people with disabilities and disability aides are, or how much the general public tends to take their independence and capabilities away from them as a whole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She might have thought you were one of these people, OP, and didn't realise that you were actually on her side, not having a go at her for having a service dog.\n\nOther people have said the SU might have been having a bad day, so there's also that to factor in.\n\nNTA, and also a very considerate person.", "NTA and at pet stores around here they offer help to everyone buying a fifty pound bag of food.\nThey were having a bad or are very sensitive but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong", "NTA I think SU didn't expect you to say that and it threw her off. I've said dumb things after someone just greets me unexpectedly \ud83d\ude06. She might be asking the same question, if she was out of line in this situation? \nThe AHs are the other dog's owners. They should have been removed or checked out somewhere else.", "That\u2019s good to hear. I\u2019m wondering would it make you feel singled out though? I always try to be desecrate when informing a service dog user. Do you think I could be doing it a different way?", "That\u2019s a good point. I worry about walking the line of warning pet owns there off lease dog or long leased dog needs to behave or to be carful as I\u2019m afraid of creating a problem with pet owning customers since many of them are not responsible and would/have gotten upset over me insinuating they can\u2019t control there dog. Lots of people don\u2019t understand disabilities and lots of people don\u2019t care especially in my small town so I guess I just assumed it would be easier to inform service dog owns and not the pet owners.", "Sure they behave well, but the other dog might not, and no one wants their service dog to get bitten in the milk aisle. That's a serious concern.", "I\u2019ve never been in a situation where a dog comes in after a service animal dose so I guess I never put much thought into if I should inform them or not. My store is clearly marked as pet friendly so I guess I would feel silly informing random customers with pets who most likely wouldn\u2019t understand why I felt the need to tell them there was a service dog user in the store. But now I\u2019m going to take a look at how I think about that and how I should approach it better.", "I would say it's actually a bit more important for service dogs.\n\nBadly behaved dogs can distract a service animal from doing their potentially life saving tasks, like warning their owners of an impending seizure or fainting.\n\nAnd if a dog attacks a service dog, it could permanently render that dog unable to continue their work by undoing its training or making it become anxious of other dogs.", "I understand that being social is usually frustrating and difficult for me too when I\u2019m not in \u201cwork mode\u201d", "I was worried it came off like that to her. I\u2019ve never been in a situation where a pet comes in after a service animal dose or near the other dog until the customer comes to checkout because I have to keep sight of the register area and they are usually at the back of the store at the dog toys. I agree it\u2019s irresponsible for my manger to allow off leased pets in the store. And I didn\u2019t mean to assume the SU didn\u2019t know it was a pet friendly store more my intention was to let them know there was currently one walking around in the store at the time. My town is small so we have days where no dogs come in at all.", "I\u2019m sort of with you here though I don\u2019t think it was intentional. To the SU, it probably seemed targeted. \n\nService dogs are supposed to be trained to deal with the distractions, warning them seems like targeting only the person with the disability. We also don\u2019t know what the SU had the dog for, so calling them an AH also feels wrong here. \n\nImma say ESH. The communication and assumptions being made on both sides just feel a very unfortunate interaction. Maybe the OP can use this as a lesson.", "Not at all, I\u2019d think you\u2019re being observant and considerate of the fact I have a working service animal but maybe that\u2019s just me. Maybe saying something like \u201cwe have a couple of non-service animals in store, just wanted to let you know in case you prefer to keep your dog at a distance\u201d  but tbh I think you phrased it fine and not in a way that singled her out, sounds like she was crabby. If you can\u2019t enforce the leashes then it could be good to speak to management about having a noticeable sign upon entry that asks customers to be mindful of any service animals that may be in store and to monitor their pets at all times :)", "I know you meant \"discreet\" but I just had an insane image of you spray painting male genitalia on a service dog.\n \n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso, you were fine, the person was an absolute spray painted dog.", "Legit service dogs are trained to act civilly around other dogs. Its the owners of other dogs who need to be extra aware of any other dog in the store. Its not telling people about service dogs vs other dogs, its telling all dog owners about any dog.\n\n\"Clearly posted\" = \"unread and/or ignored\"", "That\u2019s a great idea thank you. I absolutely love how you phrased it and I\u2019m going to be saying it like that from now on", "I agree that clearly posted = unread/ ignored as I\u2019ve had costumers be very surprised dogs are allowed at all"]}
