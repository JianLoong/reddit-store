I gave my normal welcome and gave a treat to the puppy who was noticeably all over the place and extremely hyper.

So despite only having 3 customers in line I called for register backup to help defuse the situation. When the SU heard me call for backup she sighed in a very loud annoyed way. Once backup arrived the SU walked over and slammed her items onto the counter of the backup cashier and told him to hurry up. she was buying a bag of 50lb dog food as well so per policy he asked her if she wanted any help loading the items.

It is not a valid excuse. SU behaved very rudely. Don't sweat it, but you need to talk to someone at corporate to tell them their policies need to be tightened up. Dogs MUST be on a lead and the lead cannot be extended longer than five feet to protect ALL the customers. \n\nThe way you are warning service dog owners seems TO ME really unfair because service dogs are some of the BEST behaved dogs. They have YEARS of training and are trained not to react to humans or pets while at work. It's the people with dogs on the 30' retractable leads and off leash dogs that you need to be talking to, because THEIR DOG is MORE likely to create a problem, not the service dog...so singling out the disabled people seems like a shitty way of dealing with ALL THE OTHER DOGS THAT potentially could MISBEHAVE. \n\nYou don't punish the polite child for his rude brother do you?", "NTA, but I do wonder why your warning about the other dog is only given to service dog owners.

They may also be experiencing intolerable side effects or fatigue and just trying to do their best to get home before a melt down or things other than you.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to you by any means.  But you in my mind were not the problem. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t offer the help per store policy you could have issues from your boss or issues from someone who falls or injured themselves. \n\nTry to let it go.  People in general suck.  But if I say that about a person with a disability then I get buckets of hate.

People with disabilities are constantly being approached by (well meaning) strangers and assumed they need help, they need warned, they need monitored. A wheelchair user entering a large airport \"needs\" warned and assisted and doted on despite knowing exactly what they're getting into when going to an airport. A Service Dog user \"needs\" warned that there are other dogs in the pet-friendly store she willingly walked into, \"needs\" rescuing from the puppy engaging with their service animal, \"needs\" assistance with their purchase. This is not their first day out in public either, this is every day, for their entire life. You are not the first person to look at them and try to help them do an activity they were already well prepared in advance for.\n\nIf a disabled person needs help or is uncomfortable, they will ask.\n\nWas she a bit curt the first time she said she was fine? Perhaps, but I dont think she's an asshole when I'm sure the first thing people see when they see her is her service dog. Again, it's likely not the first time someone assumed she and her dog needed special consideration.\nDo I think you were wrong in offering the advice the first time she walked in? Not really, though I would say if you are concerned only for Service Animals and not the safety of other people, animals, and children, I would personally vouch for enforcing the leash law within the store for everyone's sake.\nI think the part where YTA comes when you assumed she did not have the situation under control, panicked, called for help, and continued to try and offer assistance when she made it repeatedly clear she did not want any.\n\nAgain, I don't think you're an asshole as a person for this, just many many people don't realize just how capable people with disabilities and disability aides are, or how much the general public tends to take their independence and capabilities away from them as a whole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Dogs off leash in a store with other pets is a bad idea, they need to be strict with the leash policy and tell the people who choose to ignore it or think they are immune that THEY are not abiding by the policy and must exit the store or adhere to the rules. \n\nYou absolutely can warn customers when a dog is off leash, but that doesn't CORRECT the bad situation. Refusing entry to customers who won't abide by the policy is the only viable resolution. \n\nSome dogs are perfectly behaved 99% of the time, but what if someone has a kitten in their arms and a specific dog hates cats to the point of frenzy, only dog owner doesn't know? The dog can SMELL the cat as soon as that cat is within 100 yards, before it ever sees the cat. Dog is off leash because \"oh, he's well trained\"...then you end up with a dog possibly biting a person to get to the cat and then a dead kitten. \n\nLeash policies should NEVER BE ALLOWED TO BE BROKEN because nobody can be 100% certain their dog is not going to go nuts, and I HAVE DOGS. But they stay on leash until we get home, inside the fenced area at the dog park, or doggy daycare, because it makes it safer for EVERYBODY.", "But this is the sad part. Where there was information, and people with and without service dogs have choices, it gets replaced by rules and notices. \n\nThat happens so often, and it's so sad. I wish we could see the value in keeping things open ended, even when it means some things take more effort, more communication, and even more communication that you didn't actually need but other people might.", "The \u201coh\u201d is really a clue that they mean the thank you.  I would have followed up with \u201cwhere are they now?\u201d So I could more easily avoid them.  My SD has had to get over being scared by aggressive dogs in public.  You are good.  Corporate should give you the flexibility to restrict unleashed and aggressive dogs more.", "Don\u2019t worry, listen to the SD community, keep it up, and whenever you have the ability to restrict aggressive and unleashed dogs, do it.  For the couple with the hyper puppy, you could say, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s easier for puppies in stores when the leash is shorter, being kept near you is less stressful in such an exciting environment\u201d.  This is *true* and makes it easier for everyone.  Decent owners will learn, and cooperate.", "Not exactly, handlers need to keep their dogs well away from potentially aggressive dogs, because an aggressive dog can screw up a service dog\u2019s training, if the SD gets too scared.  Aggressive dogs in public have made handlers have to wash way too many service dogs.  It\u2019s to the point many handlers won\u2019t go to pet friendly places, to avoid their dogs having to deal with badly behaved dogs, to pretext them.\n\nSo, OP was right, if I were at the pet store, and was told there was an unleashed dog, we wouldn\u2019t go in.  If I was told there was a reactive puppy on a long leash, I would figure out where it was, and make sure to stay on the opposite side of the store.", "Agreed. I had a border collie who knew and obeyed more than 40 separate commands, in English, Spanish, hand signals and whistles. They ranged from \"come\" to \"leap through a hula hoop while catching a frisbee.\" If she was a speck on the horizon and you whistled, she would be sitting at attention by your side within seconds.\n\nUnless there was a cat. Then all bets were off. Which is why she was always on leash unless she was in a designated off leash area.", "Aye.. it's sad that we can't all be considerate and respect others.. (so guidance then turns into rules) .. but unfortunately some people are so unaware or ignorant (wilfully or unintentionally) about how their actions (or lack thereof) affect others.. \ud83d\ude16\n\nI'm no angel but have no doubt caused upset when my intentions were 100% the opposite and intended as what I thought was helpful.. (perhaps helpful by my standard.. But not what 'they' wanted or needed)\n\nHence why I don't think OP did anything wing.. and clearly the service dog user was having an intolerant / bad day..\n\nMore hugs / furry friend cuddles all round \ud83e\udd17", "I have a service dog, and what you said was *fine*.  It\u2019s just a heads up to watch out.  And then opening another register was considerate.  Asking if you need help is considerate, cashiers are SUPPOSED to ask that.  No community is AH free.
