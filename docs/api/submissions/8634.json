Until I walked through the door I assumed it would be 5 people. Me, my husband, my Father in Law, my Brother in Law, and my BILs long term girlfriend. \n\nWhen I got to the party it was roughly 20 people in a private dinning room of the restaurant. My FIL is a widower and a quiet man who keeps to himself and does not have an active social life. So 20 people was very out of the norm for him. The 20 guests were all people who are friends of my BIL through the restaurant he works at. It was people I know my FIL does not know, including one of the restaurant \u201cfriends\u201d parents who don\u2019t speak English. \nMy BIL and his girlfriend sat in the middle of the table, while my father sat next to me at the VERY end. It very quickly felt to me, like a dinner party for my BIL and his girlfriend. It was their friends, BIL made the toasts, did the ordering for the table as far as wine, and appetizers went, and generally ran the pace of the evening along with being the \u201cpoint person\u201d for the waitstaff who was serving the party. \n\nWe all ordered individual meals, and desserts. At dessert we did sing happy birthday to my FIL and that was nice. I\u2019m glad he was celebrated in some way. As we were packing up to leave after the meal, someone thanked me for buying dinner. I was SHOCKED. Nobody told me that my husband and BIL split the bill for this meal. \nI didn\u2019t say anything at the time, and my BIL and their friends, went out to the bars and brought my 70 year old FIL out with them. My FIL didn\u2019t get home until 3 am the next day. He likes to be home by 10 every night so I was pretty surprised to hear they kept him out so late for \u201chis\u201d birthday. \n\nOur portion of the bill was almost $1,000. \n\nI am VERY angry at my husband for not telling/clearing this with me before he agreed to split the check with his brother. He did NOT respect our rule \u201ctrigger number\u201d. My husband said he didn\u2019t want to fight with his older brother about it and BIL didn\u2019t ask him to split the total bill until the day before and he just agreed.\n\nBut I also find it wildly inappropriate that it appears to me like my BIL used this opportunity to have a dinner party for his friends. None of it was about my FIL, and nobody was there who was his age or who even would call him on his ACTUAL birthday later in the week. It feels so rude to me! Not to mention that we paid for it! \n\nWhen I talked to BIL and his girlfriend about it later in the following week they acted totally flabbergasted by my frustration. \u201cHe was among FRIENDS!\u201d. \u201cHe had met all of these people before at my super bowl parties!\u201d \u201cOne of them waited on us when we went into the restaurant one time, he KNOWS them.\u201d \u201cAll that matters is that the birthday boy had a good time. Who cares who was there.\u201d Are all things that were part of their rebuttal. \n\nI think I am being gaslit by my in-laws into thinking this is normal birthday behavior.", "created_utc": 1675014524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10odmiz/aita_for_being_mad_about_the_guest_list_for_my/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're mad, understandably, about the surprise THOUSAND DOLLARS out of your pocket. Anybody would be. Don't go to any of BIL's parties anymore. And have a real talk with your husband about boundaries.", "NTA for being mad, however you should ask your father in law how he felt about it before taking action.", "NTA \nYour BiL was out of line for inviting all of his friends to his father\u2019s birthday dinner \nAnd then to find out you\u2019re paying for it as well - I would mad as well \nYour BiL sounds insensitive", "NTA. \n\nBIL manipulated everyone in this.", "NTA. Sounds like your husband disregarded a rule you had made well in advance. BIL is disregarding his father\u2019s event. I will say, however, you should probably ask your FIL if he chose the guest list, cause you seem as if you might be hiding his reaction to get more internet validation than if he had responded with \u201cNo, I was perfectly happy with the guest list.\u201d But unless your FIL has dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, or the like, BIL really shouldn\u2019t have been making all the decisions for him. Good luck!", "NTA, your BIL is an AH for inviting only his friends and making your husband pay for them too, and your husband is wrong for not checking with you or trying to make it about his dad like it should\u2019ve been.", "NTA: The gall of your BIL to throw a party for his own ego (let's admit it had nothing to do with your FIL) and have you and your hubs pay half the bill.\n\nYou are being gaslit. It's too late now, but in the future you'll need to make sure boundaries are set clearly beforehand.\n\nQuestion: Did you FIL say he had a good time? That doesn't negate the fact you paid a ridiculous amount of money for a party you didn't know was happening, but it might remove some of the sting if he had a good time.", "Did your father in law ever talk to you about how he felt about the party? You seem to be making a lot of assumptions about him based on his age, but he might have enjoyed a a change from his usual quiet life. NTA for not wanting to spend a 1000$ without notice and without having a say on the guest list though.", "NTA. It seems like it was a party for your BIL. I'd be mad too if I found out my BIL invited all those people and then expected me to pay for half. $1k is a lot of money for a dinner party, especially when it was supposed to just be family celebrating your FIL. Your husband shouldn't have agreed to pay for half without talking to you about it and honestly I'd try to get some of that back. Idk why yall didn't just have each person pay for their own meal, except for your FIL.\n\nIf your FIL enjoyed going out after that's a separate issue that you should probably talk to him about.", "NTA. You ARE being gas-lit!  None of these people were your FIL's FRIENDS - they don't even qualify as acquaintances and certainly not 'close' enough to him that YOU should be paying for their food.  Would YOU be okay with a fake birthday party where you didn't know most of the people? Your FIL may be older, but that doesn't make him stupid, and your BIL shouldn't be treating him that way. Your BIL packed the room with HIS friends and got himself a party, on YOUR dime.  Your husband is totally an AH for violating your agreed-upon spending plan and that is inexcusable!! There was no need for him to say \"yes\" without a quick confab with you, or at minimum he could have told you away.    Your BIL should pay for this himself.", "Absolutely not. I would be livid especially with my husband. How dare him spend like that and know ahead of time as well. That is insane. We would be having some serious marital conversations about that. And his brother is a user. NTA. Your husband and BIL are though.", "It\u2019s hard to give a proper judgement on this. You\u2019re mad about the guest list but you\u2019ve never actually confirmed with FIL how he felt about the party? Or if he wanted to go out after and if he had fun? \n\nYou\u2019re jumping to conclusions based on your history with him. But why can\u2019t you just have a conversation and ask about how he felt? If he enjoyed his party and the people there, you\u2019re the AH. If he didn\u2019t, you\u2019re not and justified in your feelings. But if you truly care about your FIL as much as this post is posturing, your first step would have been to actually ask the person how they felt about their party.", "One AH thing you said is that none of the guests were his age.  Guess what?  People can have friends who are much younger than them.\nOn the bill issue you are not the AH.  While your BIL sounds insufferable, that one is on your husband for not talking to you about that first.", "ESH.  Your FIL is 70, not a child.  Let him handle his own business...if he didn't want to go out clubbing, he could have said something.  Besides, maybe he did want this type of celebration? Did he tell you he didn't enjoy it?\n\nBut your husband is a giant AH for not speaking to you beforehand about splitting the dinner bill.  I'm surprised that you seem less bent out of shape about that than FIL getting his groove on.", "NTA, but I wouldn't be mad at your husband over it. It sounds as though he was as surprised as you were and just went along with it for his father's sake. I guess in the future, you know that you need to clarify things with your BIL before agreeing to anything. But for this recent party, judging by their reactions, I don't think you're going to get anywhere with them. You may be better off dropping it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No one forced him to stay out until 3 AM, he\u2019s perfectly capable of getting himself home if that\u2019s what he wants. You\u2019re not telling us whether he enjoyed himself, which is what matters. Your issue is with your husband and the $1000, especially since he knew about it the day before.

Between inflation and a lot more people showing up it turned out to be a lot more expensive than their fiftieth, and SIL is not well off. My wife was mortified, but I told her we could cover it and let people pay what they felt they could and contribute in other ways.  SIL handled the photo show and her kids did a miniconcert and they were a big part of making it special. BIL drove with us and enabled us to save $2K in airfare and car rental.   That said... your husband needs to step up, not just in terms of letting you know what is going on but in terms of coordinating with his brother for events like this rather than assuming that someone else will do it.", "Why would BIL NOT do all of that?

His widow beat him into submission through their marriage and now he hardly talks or engages. Lives a VERY quiet and secluded life.", "I am assuming he did not want to out to the bars or stay out till 3 am. I know that based on previous attempts to take him out and from his frequent requests to be home by 10 pm from other get togethers. \n\nHowever no, I have not reached out to my FIL directly to ask how he felt about the party.", "OP only says it didn\u2019t respect their trigger amount which is a matter of trust and communication, not finances.", "Is there any room for it to be \u201cwell my sons threw me a party and I will never be mad about it, no matter what it is\u201d?

Time for husband to learn to say No to his brother. \n\nThis was definitely a party for BIL, who used dad's birthday as an excuse to get husband to pay half.

Nothing is ambiguous about that situation. \n\nAlso FIL did NOT get his groove on. He went to a pool hall till 3 am where he commented on how smoky he smelled and how he felt like he needed to burn his clothes after. \n\nStill possible he had a good time; but I cannot overstate how out of character that would be for him in the decade I have been in his life.", "Bil only did something wrong if he didn't clear the guest list with her husband and fil. If those people knew the score, then it's on her husband for not communicating. It husband was blindsided by a huge group, thinking it was maybe 4-5 people, then bil is the AH. If bil and husband knew but didn't ask the fil they are the ah. So, I think who is the ah depends. It is either bil,  or the husband. Possibly both if fil didn't know the invite list. If husband knew the guest list, then op is also the ah for yelling at bil", "Why would her husband think the guest list would include 20 people their dad (the person the party was for) doesn\u2019t know?", "Woof. I meant ask FIL if he chose the guest list, but that information makes this story a lot more believable. Make sure he\u2019s okay.", "That's what I find confusing, why would he go with them if he didn't want to? Couldn't he have gotten home by himself or asked you to drop him off after dinner if that's what he wanted? I understand your anger about the money, but unless you're very close to your fil and / or he's particularly frail, I wouldn't do or say anything on his behalf, especially without checking with him first.", "you should honestly", "It's finances as well. All of the above.", "Well if that\u2019s true then it\u2019s not your place to be this upset about it.", "That is true; I will readily admit I do not call each of my friends on their birthdays.  Of course for all I know they are all on here posting about me\ud83d\ude06", "What's missing here is that no one actually talked to FIL about what he wanted.  \n\nSit FIL down and let him know that you are willing to be an advocate for him in situations where he feels he is being steamrolled.  Be the' bad guy' for him if that's what he wants.  If he takes you up on your offer, great, but if he declines, then respect his decision and back off.", "Why would he not be involved and discuss it with BIL?

But if I had attended a friends birthday party earlier in the week, I would at least shoot them a text on the day of, 3 days later. But everyone is different I guess! \n\nI will also say he does not have any of their phone numbers.", "Why would he have to inquire about the guest list for a birthday dinner for their dad?\n\nOP says her FiL has no active social life\nMaybe he could have asked about the list of people coming but in this case it was safe to assume it would be five people \n\nOP isn\u2019t the AH and I don\u2019t want to stick blame on the husband either - in my opinion BiL is completely to blame", "You don't agree to go financial halfsies without discussing what that looks like - especially when you're not looping your SO in on the conversation.", "Your husband sucks!

If I were your husband, I wouldn't pay for it - I'd cover the two of you, FIL and maybe round up a little from there and say that's it.\n\nAlso you two should take FIL out for a nice quiet dinner at a place of his choosing, just the 3 of you.", "No one wants to allow that 70 year old widowed dad might have wanted to have some fun and his son  in the hospitality industry with fun friends made sure dad had fun until 3am?

No reason to make him feel bad about the cost or who paid for it.", "If he's like a lot of 70yr olds he'll say it was fine, just fine.", "The only place I will correct you is that he COULD NOT have gone home at any time. \n\nHe was stuck because BIL insisted on driving him. FIL like most people his age does not like any kind of ride sharing apps and refuses to use them, so we could not call him an Uber or Lyft or anything. \n\nHe could not have gone home at any time.", "Yellow Cab", "He doesn\u2019t have a cell phone with internet connection so it would have required my BIL, or someone looking up the number, and calling him a cab. \n\nHe is also so incredibly passive he wouldn\u2019t have done it. \n\nYou can continue to argue with me, but I\u2019m telling you him leaving the bars was not an option.", "To be quite honest, it sounds like your FIL got railroaded through the night and used as a fig-leaf excuse for your BIL to have the party he wanted. This sounds like the sort of thing a ma of your FIL\u2019s description would just mentally brace himself to grin and bear until he got home."]}
