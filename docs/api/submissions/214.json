My new job has 2 managers. Store manager (40 something F) and warehouse manager (40 something M). (Context: Store manager & warehouse manager are sleeping together. I know this because store manager told me and showed me texts of dirty talk between the two of them. She's a friend of the family so we're close-ish) \n\nWarehouse manager called me last week on my day off due to a workplace emergency. (Our store manager had just found out that our store was unintentionally selling recalled products). They needed my help immediately removing the product from the shelves (2 aisles worth). The thing is, I had 2 appointments that were non negotiable that day. I had a phone consultation with my doctor about getting me into therapy, and I had to accompany my grandmother to her doctor's appointment because she gets very nervous going to these things alone. \n\nHe said fine and I thought that was the end of it. I go in for my next shift and he immediately lays into me about \"not keeping my word that I would come in whenever they need me\" (I did say I would come in if they needed me, as long as they gave me at least 3 days notice. I made this very clear in the beginning, and as I stated above that my plans could not be canceled when he called me) He also threatened to take away the hours he was giving me because I \"apparently didn't need them\". I told him I didn't need anything from him and reminded him that it was the store manager who handed out hours. He left immediately afterwards. \n\nI then spoke to store manager, told her everything that happened, and told her to tell warehouse manager to never call or text me again because he isn't my boss, she is. She said she would talk to him but I doubt it will go my way because as I said before, they are sleeping together. \n\nI have decided that if it continues on my next shift with that manager, then I would give him 1 warning with the threat of quitting, after that and I'm going to quit and leave them high and dry. I am trying to leave 1 abusive job, I don't need another. \n\nSo here's why I might be TAH: \n-Gonna quit if it continues \n-They will be left very short on staff (it's a very small store) \n-Quitting without warning makes me look very unprofessional. \n\nBut honestly, I'm just trying to take care of my mental health and now my physical health. But I feel like I'm reaching my breaking point. (I'm also a student if that counts towards anything).", "created_utc": 1667253070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiq1pg/wibtah_if_i_gave_my_new_boss_an_ultimatum/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they don't hire you  you probably dodged a bullet bc like I said, this kind of employer LOVES someone who's already been trained elsewhere...if you say \"I don't deal with crap management\" and they don't hire you despite your experience, it's likely bc they know they have crap management and they worry that you'll quit mid-shift with them too.", "NTA.

You don't owe a workplace anything other than the hours you have committed to (and that *doesn't* include extra hours at their convenience for cleaning up after their mistakes.) \n\nHowever, I have a feeling if you threaten to quit the warehouse manager might just fire you on the spot, so you would have to be ready for that.\n\nIt's not your fault if they end up short staffed.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m going to just tell you a different perspective on your situation. As a manager I\u2019ve always been in charge of hiring and firing. So I know actual good employees that have just a basic level of logic and common sense are really hard to find. A lifetime ago when I wasn\u2019t the manager I always wondered why they tolerated certain things. Now I know. So if an employee does something that causes a big mistake I do talk to them about it. In my mind I usually go with the three strikes your out policy. Not showing up on a scheduled day off would NOT be one of those things. I don\u2019t give three strikes if they commit a crime. For example I fired someone on the spot for fraud. So when thinking of quitting about things like this, I also try for myself and recommend to others to use that three strike policy too. We are all human and make mistakes and sometimes say the wrong thing. You already spoke with the manager so I would count that as one strike. You can look for another job in the meantime. But if you just quit with no notice at all you can\u2019t use them as a reference ever. It\u2019s a small world and a good reputation is priceless. \n\nIf you do plan to quit because you don\u2019t think they deserve more strikes, then don\u2019t tell them. Many years ago I had two male employees who were doing a terrible job so I warned them if they didn\u2019t improve I would let them go. So the next day, they both \u201cfell\u201d off a balcony. They went on workers como and you can\u2019t\t fire someone if they\u2019re on workers comp. I fired them as soon as they were released to come back to work but never did. So I\u2019m way more careful after that bad experience. \n\nIf anyone wonders what great lengths I go to so I can find good people, ask. It\u2019s pretty shocking actually. \n\nI only wrote this so you can see it from every direction. That is usually what I do on everything. Some people say there\u2019s two sides to every story. I usually say there\u2019s about five sides to every story. \n\nBest of luck.\n\nEdit: word change for clarification", "I know, I just always try to have pride in my work and I try to please people too much.
