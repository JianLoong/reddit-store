Plus, a female friend of SIL and Jake started living them after her divorce to get back on her feet and let\u2019s just say it was uncomfortable because of how comfortable Jake and her were with each other and how they would both joke about SIL. Now my brother meant it in the way where he didn\u2019t mean any of it and it was just to show how much he loved her. But my niece picked up that bad habit and she\u2019s at that age where kids are honest about things that adults realize are rude.\n\nMy brother was away when SIL got into an accident. When we went to the hospital Emily saw her in a really bad shape and it traumatized her. The doctors said it was best if Emily didn\u2019t see her again. SIL had two emergency surgeries and is struggling to wake up. Jake flew back and had issues seeing her and every time he did get to she was unconscious/asleep. \n\nBoth Jake and Emily are struggling with guilt because the last memory SIL has is them saying rude things, Emily because she was a kid in shock at seeing her mom like that and Jake because he texted her \u201cI don\u2019t love you actually I hate you\u201d in response to SIL\u2019s \u201cI love you\u201d\n\nOur family gossiped about how it looked like SIL wasn\u2019t going to make it but their female friend was itching to be a stepmother and my son Matt overheard.\n\nHe asked me in front of Emily and Jake if SIL was going to live with us after the hospital since she wasn\u2019t going to be Emily\u2019s mommy anymore and Emily was going to get a new mommy.\n\nEmily started sobbing and Jake went to comfort her. I took Matt aside and said it was rude to say things like that and why. I had him apologize to Emily. Jake was furious and said I should ground him or punish him because of his behavior.

You were right to tell him not to take his anger out on your kid, and good on you for telling your son that what he said was inappropriate. Your son is 8, he meant no harm in it.

You\u2019re SIL\u2019s parents had a post about this last month (?). I think it\u2019s gone now. NTA, but your brother and the bestie were competing for that honor.

I don\u2019t see her family relenting anytime soon from what they wrote.", "NTA OP.\n\nYour son did what any child his age does, takes whatever he overhead from adults as fact. You did your part by telling why what he said was wrong. Brother must kick a hill.\n\nOn a similar note, when my son was about 7/8 he inadvertently exposed my aunt's affair by using Superman. Out of tf blue said \"gram-gram is like opposite Superman. Sometimes she's with uncle A, sometimes with uncle B but kisses both like uncle C (her husband)\". Then asked for ice cream and went to play outside. Kids are social sponges who will always word vomit things they hear and see", "NTA.  And if Jake wants to be angry at someone it would be the relatives gossiping and doing it in the hearing of young children.

I know he feels guilty but his behavior is unhealthy in so many ways and it\u2019s affecting Emily too", "Matt wasn\u2019t being malicious at all.

The fact that this behaviour is prevalent and public enough that his child has picked up on it is worrying. \n\nI really hope sil recovers and this is the wake up call your brother needs to start acting better. \n\nCaveat here though, almost this exact situation was posted recently, so this story may just be another troll post and I'm wasting my time commenting.", "Your brother brought a fair amount of that suffering on himself with his actions and words prior to the accident.  Your son acted like any other child that age would where they just spew out gossip as fact. I did that at that age, my kids all did that at that age. Embarrassing for the adults, but it presents a teaching moment, which you handled well. You and your family absolutely have my sympathy, this is a horrible thing for anyone to go through and I hope your SIL fully recovers. When SIL recovers I hope your brother corrects his bad behaviors and appropriately grovels.", "As long as you weren\u2019t involved in the gossip, NTA\u2014 it is definitely an AH thing to gossip about, but even if you were involved in the gossip, your son is definitely not at fault and he didn\u2019t do anything wrong! He apologized which is exactly right, you handled his behavior perfectly.", "I know that Jake loves SIL a lot and was basically living on the floor of her hospital room when she was allowed visitors but he can definitely be immature and thoughtless. I\u2019m giving him a pass for things right now since he\u2019s under a lot of stress especially with Emily who\u2019s is a bit precocious and came to the conclusion that the reason that she wasn\u2019t allowed to see her mother date wasn\u2019t because of the trauma it would cause Emily but because her mother was actually already dead. It took a lot of effort to show her that SIL was still alive back when she was allowed visitors but a lot of progress was just set back", "I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s still at their house even after it all went down. Honestly if it were me and my husband I would be asking for divorce. The only thing is that I know that Jake loves SIL so much  and he doesn\u2019t realize how his actions come across. \n\nOriginally Jake was at a business trip abroad which is super common for his job (he goes out of the country at least 12-13 times a year) and when my SIL got into an accident he got held up because one of his Covid tests didn\u2019t clear but the other did and a bunch of paperwork so the female friend babysat Emily and took her to see SIL right after surgery and Emily was traumatized to see her mother\u2019s mangled bandaged body and she screamed monster and ran out and then the doctors said we caused her trauma because she was too young to see that though the age cap was 5 and up and the female friend wasn\u2019t equipped to handle the tantrums so I took Emily in while SIL\u2019s parents watched over SIL but then SIL ended up declining really fast and went in for two more emergency surgeries and is struggling so when Jake got to see her she was never awake/alert. He\u2019s been sobbing constantly since and he and Emily really moved in so there was family support since he didn\u2019t sleep or eat", "Thank you it\u2019s been really tough since it really seems like SIL isn\u2019t going to make it and this is after our high hopes since first emergency surgery after her car crash went so well that the doctors were even surprised how well she recovered. It seemed like it was just a few days in the ICU and then rehab before she got home but then complications came up and she got a blood infection or something and then she had to go back for more surgeries and they stopped allowing her visitors at all since her condition was bad. I know that\u2019s why Jake is acting like this but honestly he can\u2019t take it out on my son who was just being a thoughtless kid. Matt learned his lesson about repeating gossip and apologized to Emily", ":/ I hope Jake realizes how bizarre all of this is. He's 30 years old and important enough to have a job that has him traveling internationally. It's time for him to grow up.", "Obviously I know it's a different situation, but I have a very close friend that was hospitalized for a while for a blood infection. I think it was around day 5 of her being in ICU when I got to visit and I left thinking I had just told her goodbye. People can recover from the most dire of circumstances, and let's just all assume that you're all just seeing the worst right now, and that the upside is just around the corner.", "Thank you that is reassuring because we all want SIL to pull through this and the doctor s have been realistic about expectations and said she\u2019s not doing great"]}
