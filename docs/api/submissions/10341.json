It took a lot of effort to show her that SIL was still alive back when she was allowed visitors but a lot of progress was just set back", "I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s still at their house even after it all went down. Honestly if it were me and my husband I would be asking for divorce.

It seemed like it was just a few days in the ICU and then rehab before she got home but then complications came up and she got a blood infection or something and then she had to go back for more surgeries and they stopped allowing her visitors at all since her condition was bad. I know that\u2019s why Jake is acting like this but honestly he can\u2019t take it out on my son who was just being a thoughtless kid.

He's 30 years old and important enough to have a job that has him traveling internationally. It's time for him to grow up.", "Obviously I know it's a different situation, but I have a very close friend that was hospitalized for a while for a blood infection. I think it was around day 5 of her being in ICU when I got to visit and I left thinking I had just told her goodbye.

OP, tell your brother to look in the mirror, because the reason any of this gossip is swirling around is because of HIS actions and HIS inability to be a good partner. Thoughtlessness is an excuse and unless he's a six year old he should've been adult enough to read the room and see that his wife being injured in the hospital is not the time to \"joke around.\" His wife doesn't want to see them because she's heartbroken and tired of taking this abuse when she should be healing. He has a lot of growing up to do and if he cares about his wife at all he needs to take a good look at himself and step up to be even a halfway decent husband that she deserves, and that involves acknowledging that he's been a terrible partner and allowed his wife to feel like a stranger in her own home", "Hey! I think your SIL's parents posted about your brother and the female friend maybe a month ago?  Let me find it!", "Your brother and his wife\u2019s so called friend, who she gave shelter to, let\u2019s not forget that. Gave her somewhere to live when she had nowhere to go.

There is no reasoning with a man in this situation.", "The post was removed but a copy/paste of it by the mods is at the bottom part of the comment thread", "I feel like I read a similar post where the 'friend' if dad brought a child to mom in hospital and remarked that mom looked like a mummy. Kid was terrified, said hurtful things about mom and left. Is this the same situation but with a question about your 8ye old son's new involvement? Or is this tragically 2 separate families and set of people?", "Understandably OP this is a difficult time for everyone. Jake is hoping his immature \"I hate you\" message will be treated as normal banter by his wife instead of realizing her body has undergone massive trauma. She may not be mentally able to waste her energy on Jake's dumb opposite game.He needs to step up and use his words correctly. This is not the time to tease her.\n\n . As for your niece, please help get her into therapy. The therapist can ease her mind that mommy isn't a monster, or dead. Mommy is healing and may have some scars or other physical limitations but is still her mommy that loves her. She is a child that needs more reassurance and needs to be taught age appropriate coping skills.\n\nOP, you said you cannot stop your Aunties from gossiping but you can make sure the kids are not around where they can accidentally hear. Your son asked an honest question with no malicious intent. You handle it wonderfully. Please don't put the kids back in that position again. \n\n As for the friend in their home, please ask your brother if  you or your husband can ease the burden of giving her a set date to move out. Jake is probably too overwhelmed to be thinking about her situation. I do not know if your SIL will need a caretaker or nurse when she gets discharged. Having that extra room available for family or a nurse would be helpful. And your SIL deserves the right to heal and convalescence in her own home without catering to her post divorce friend making dumb opposite jokes with her husband. \n\nI am glad your brother and niece are there with you so you can remind them to eat, sleep shower, etc... I am sending positive thoughts your way and pray your SIL heals quickly and can come home soon.", "I immediately thought of that same post.", "N T A for not punishing your son-he did nothing wrong.

Does he punish himself every time HE\u2019S an asshole and says something rude to his wife (and he does it on purpose!)?", "My heart breaks for your SIL and Emily.

He said something that hurt your niece's feelings, but it was a solid question based on what you describe here. And by punishing your son, or even say it was a rude thing to say, you are confusing him because he literally heard adults say the same thing, so why was it rude for him to say it? I almost want to call you an AH just for pulling your son aside and saying he was rude at all. \n\nI think what you said to your brother is right- given what has been unfolding, my son just said what others are thinking and saying to each other. So unless we are punishing the adults, your son isn't going to be punished either, and you can appreciate why he is stressed out and wants to direct his anger somewhere, but an 8 year old isn't the place to direct it.", "how can you punish your son for repeating something y\u2019all said? he was just curious. \n\nNTA. the only AH here is your brother & the female friend", "NTA your son is just a kid and you acted appropriately by explaining why it was rude and having him apologize.", "NTA but also INFO: How did his wife feel about his humour before the accident? Did she find it funny and endearing to be told 'I hate you', did she enjoy having her husband, friend and daughter make jokes about her, was she happy that her friend and husband got very close and comfortable together?\n\nBecause honestly it sounds like Jake had a quasi-affair with another woman in his wife's own home,  joined with his affair partner in turning their daughter against her mother and mocking her, told his wife he hated her and is now panicking at realising how awfully he's behaved and trying to backtrack.", "I was trying to figure out who \"Matt\" was.

Immediately reminded me of the same story", "Exactly. It gets to a point where the recipient of such comments and others witnessing wonder if there's at least a kernel of truth trying to hide in a \"joke.\"\n\nI always respond to these posts that seem plausible in good faith. I know some people IRL who do read these in search of advice. Sadly, this one does seem plausible. I've known many people who say similar hurtful \"jokes\"- it's a way for them to be passive aggressive rather than address what they honestly might feel. Like someone I knew who would \"joke\" about leaving his wife or \"joke\" about getting a mistress. He was deeply unhappy with his wife (and for good reasons), and they both had such poor communication skills. The \"joker\" wanted the wife to get upset, to show she cares.", "I know everyone is different, but my first reaction is that wouldn't at least the niece want to be in the comfort of her own home? The OP sound likes a solid person, but a lot of kids would want to be at home. Never mind the \"friend\" just living at the house like it's hers.", "I personally agree with you. Sleeping in your own bed, being surrounded by what comforts me is what I would want in this kind of situation. What I don't know is how his daughter feels about it - is being surrounded by what reminds her of her mother hurtful and this is better? Idk, the whole friend situation just rubs me the wrong way.", "The brother wants OP to punish her son for something the brother would say \"as a joke\".", "Its definitely the same. I realized that immediately. In the first post SiL was refusing to see her husband.", "That post made me so angry that I wanted to yell at Sonja and Liam myself if that OP wouldn't do it.
