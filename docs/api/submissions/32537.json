The owners recently sold it and the new ones are moving in, so my daughter and her husband have to move. The problem is rents have gone up dramatically. The rent they are paying is $1100 (for a 1 bedroom), which I thought was a lot, but now that I'm trying to help them find a place, most are now going for around $2000 a month or more! They can't afford this.\n\nMy daughter knows she is always welcome at home, granted a baby complicates things. I wasn't happy about her having a baby (she's young, just turned 22), but I would never deny her housing. However, I can't stand her husband (let's just call him Aaron for simplicity's sake). I wouldn't invite Aaron over for dinner, let alone let him live with me. Aaron's in his mid 30s. Criminal history. Hair trigger temper. Chronically immature and has one hell of a jealous/possessive streak that has caused strain in their relationship (which I obviously do not approve of).\n\nHonestly, when she told me she was pregnant, I finally thought we'd be rid of Aaron. I genuinely thought he's exactly the kind of man to ditch (they've been on and off over and over since she was about 18/19). Alas, if anything it made him cling to her tighter. They had a very rushed wedding and this is their longest stint together without any breakups. Just over a year. There's still been the fair share of dramatics, of course, but I am surprised they've made it this far.\n\nEven so, I simply don't want to live with Aaron. I don't like him. I don't want him around me. I'd go above and beyond for my daughter and the baby, they can stay as long as they need, but not him. \n\nObviously, this has created a rift between my daughter and I. She doesn't want to live separately from Aaron. I told her then she needs to figure out alternative arrangements. Well, their move out date is rapidly approaching (the 15th of December) and they've still not been able to find a place, and she's panicking. She's been begging me to let them stay.\n\nI reiterated my terms. Aaron simply cannot stay here. This led to a lot of tears and some angry words. Namely, me being an asshole.

Knowing that they always have a safe place to go, even if it\u2019s not right away, may make all the difference down the road.", "Hurt people hurt people.", "Going for a barely out of highschool young lady while in his 30\u2019s, and impregnating her while not having much money to support her or the baby is pretty shitty human behavior.  I\u2019m getting the feeling she\u2019s doing a majority of the work looking for housing.", "&#x200B;\n\nThat's interesting and nuanced, but a bit besides the point. He just sounds like someone who is dangerous to live with, so he can't be in your home.", "I mean, the entire point of my comment is that no man in his mid-30s should be pursuing a relationship with someone who is 18/19. Does it really surprise you that a man that age who doesn't have his shit together enough to get a woman near his own age is also not mature enough to provide for a child?", "Perhaps some can learn to grow and mature, but I'd typically say that a person who hasn't matured by the time they're in their 30s is a lost cause.", "As a man in my 30s, no. Lets not act like there aren't shitty men. \n\nLets instead recognize that shitty men exist, and do better.", "Nah. Saying that is demeaning to all of the actual boys who aren't shitty people. These dudes are just assholes who want a young, naive wife they can control and dominate.", "Emotional maturity, financial stability, involvement in home chores and parenting, lots of things.

Oral leases are enforceable despite their informal nature.\n\nI swear to God you can easily fact check this stuff using a search engine.  Don't let landlords walk all over you.", "Question:\u00a0I just found out my landlord is selling my rental house \u2013 what does this mean for my housing situation?\n\nAnswer:\u00a0If you rent a home and you discover your landlord is selling the property, don\u2019t start panicking (or packing) just yet. If you signed a lease agreement, your current and future landlord will have to honor the terms.\n\nTerm Lease Agreement\n\nA term lease agreement is a housing agreement between landlord and tenant for a designated amount of time, typically 6-months to one year. If you learn about the sale of your rental property, and you still have a few months left on your lease agreement, your new landlord will not be able to kick you out. \n\nWhen a buyer purchases a renter-occupied home, he must agree to take over the lease and honor the terms the tenant signed. A buyer can ask the renter to sign a new lease with him, but technically the tenant does not have to.", "Being online allows us to pass judgements really easily, because we don't have to deal with them.\n\nBut in the real world, we have to deal with real consequences.\n\nOP is the best person to make the judgement call, and I would add since they're already married with a kid, then OP has to decide where she draws her boundary here.", "I think they are shitty qualities to have, but good and even great people can have shitty qualities.\n\nNow, in my opinion, Aaron is neither good nor great, though I do believe he aspires to at least be the former.", "Shes defending him in the comments and now I\u2019m confused.", "Since she was \"about 18-19\" right at age of consent, assuming thats when they met and wasnt groomed prior to that or lied to her mom about the relationship beginning. She's now 22 and jumped into a shotgun wedding with a controlling man who she's been in an on/off relationship with for only 5 years. Unfortunately I think OP is right to defend him in the comments. She has to be understanding for her daughter so she doesn't get isolated from her. I just hope that OP having a perfectly healthy boundary about refusing him in her house doesnt cause the daughter to reject her mom in favor of this creep.", "Aaron and OP\u2019s daughter won\u2019t agree to this because they\u2019re most likely thinking living with OP as long term arrangement.", "3 in daughters place not 4 I read", "Thanks for the link!", "So glad you posted this!!! Perfect! Yes please have her read that op..and you too so you have a better understanding of how to communicate with her. \nGood luck!", "Oh Lordy... this was me.\n\nDefinitely daddy issues (I was molested by him, mother fucker) so I was 20 when I met my 35 year old boyfriend. He lived in a total shithole low income hotel but he was sooooooo hooooooottttttt (eyeroll). \n\nThis went down exactly as expected. Moved in together, he controlled every aspect of my life and even took my paychecks, he cheated, I moved out but then he couldn't afford to rent on his own, he moved back in with me and my mom, I got pregnant at 22 but then miscarried at about 5 1/2 months. Finally dumped him  because he sucked the whole time I was pregnant, wanting me to abort her, refusing to speak about her at all and just ignoring the situation, and then said I would have been a bad mom anyway and he would have gotton custody. Which was laughable because he has NO family, NO money, NO job, was an alcoholic...\n\nSo I'm nearly 38 now. After I lost the kid I grew up. A lot. Even thinking about him now and again I cringe, and if my family brings him up I immediately tell them never to talk about him again. \n\nHe was the most stupidest, embarrassing, grossest mistake I had ever made in my life. I was devasted at the time I lost the baby but I fully 100% believe it was for the best. \n\nI was a completely lost 20 year old. Now whenever I read these older man stories (for context he was 16 years older than me) I just try to warn these girls. I have grown and evolved so much since then.", "The 18 or 19 year old is probably not mature enough but there are people who graduate high school at 16 or are working since the age of 14-15 and are well-traveled executives at 19. These are very rare situations but then these types of age-difference relationships should be very rare.", "There is a such thing as month to month. If I pay rent for December my landlord can decide he doesn\u2019t want to continue in January,", "Again, you are the only one who is fit to judge the situation, but this is AITA and you asked for other people's opinion. I stand by what I said in that him being so jealous and possessive that it causes strain in his relationship with your daughter and is to the point that you obviously notice it makes him a less than ideal partner. I really hope that he's working on himself as your daughter says.  \n\nIn truth, I'm not sure why you're now trying to defend him against things you yourself said. It's up to you whether you trust him enough to let him live with you or not.", "I'm sorry to tell you this, but jealous, possessive, and a temper spells abuse. He's a predator who groomed your daughter and likely has kept her around through abuse. \n\nYou are well within your rights to not want him in your house, but he will NOT allow her to leave him. Having her in the home will give her a sense of safety and I think she's more likely to break up with him once she has additional support in the home. You also have the ability to see him in the relationship firsthand, and can contact police if he freaks out, getting him out of the home. \n\nPersonally I think the way to reach your goal and save your daughter is to allow him to move in, but you may want to reach out to a professional to get their take.", "I'm really sorry, but you sound like my mother regarding my sisters husband. Sister was in love with him, but we all thought he was a bit weird. However, her choice, she loved him for whatever reason. Then she became totally dependent on him, he phased everyone out of their lives, save for my parents because they helped them out especially when they had kids. My mother really, really tried to see the good in him and reason everything away, because after all, he was my sisters choice and there were kids involved.\n\nThen it turns out my BIL beat my sister and demanded the weirdest things of her, never quit his weed smoking or alcoholic habits. He turned out to be a narcissist. When that all came out my mother worried about my sister until she left the man, but she feels awful now that she kept convincing herself for so long, instead of telling my sister she needed to really look at her relationship and what kind of man BIL really is.\n\nYour daughter doesn't want to see the danger she's in because she's clinging onto some narrative, which is probably some romantic idea of 'we're made for each other'. That's why she's upset about your boundaries, but honestly, having a little time away from him may help her see things in another perspective. Don't talk bad about him, but don't talk like you do here either. Leave your opinion out of it, she'll figure it out herself eventually. All you have to do now is tell her that whatever happens, your door is always open for her and your grandchild even if she's angry now and goes no contact for a long time, even if she's ashamed if she sees what's really going on, even if you disagree with her life choices.", "Bless your heart.", "Op is the daughter. Or Aaron", "I'm a he. \n\nAm I defending him? Maybe? boggles my mind to think about. I do genuinely feel bad how people are imagining Aaron. I think people took what I said and really ran with it. I believe everyone is envisioning this terrible monster. Aaron has his faults, but in my opinion, is not a monster.", "This \\^\\^\\^ -- they want to move in with mom permanently.", "I meant if the OP allows her son in law to stay, it's 3 adults and 1 baby in an apartment.", "There's just not much in common between a 35 and 20 yr old. Generally, a 35 yr old is probably not that great of a guy if he's going for someone that much younger. Yes, it's legal but maturity-wise it's like a 25 yr old dating a 15 yr old. Unfortunately, the younger and less mature person spending so much time under the influence of the older person will be nearly impossible to be shown the error of their ways by others who care about them.", "I've been close with several people who were in a similar situation so I also have lots of empathy and feel sick when I read stories like yours. I'm really glad that you were able to get away and that your story at least sounds like it has a happier ending. I wish you a happy life and best of luck in whatever you do in the future!", "This was such a refreshing self-reflection to read. Thanks for sharing your story!\n\nFrom,\nA 36-year-old who has an almost 8-month-old with a 53-year-old who I allowed to control my every move for far too long\n\nI can definitely say I\u2019ve finally learned my lesson.
