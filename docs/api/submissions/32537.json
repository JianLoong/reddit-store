The owners recently sold it and the new ones are moving in, so my daughter and her husband have to move. The problem is rents have gone up dramatically. The rent they are paying is $1100 (for a 1 bedroom), which I thought was a lot, but now that I'm trying to help them find a place, most are now going for around $2000 a month or more! They can't afford this.\n\nMy daughter knows she is always welcome at home, granted a baby complicates things. I wasn't happy about her having a baby (she's young, just turned 22), but I would never deny her housing. However, I can't stand her husband (let's just call him Aaron for simplicity's sake). I wouldn't invite Aaron over for dinner, let alone let him live with me. Aaron's in his mid 30s. Criminal history. Hair trigger temper. Chronically immature and has one hell of a jealous/possessive streak that has caused strain in their relationship (which I obviously do not approve of).\n\nHonestly, when she told me she was pregnant, I finally thought we'd be rid of Aaron. I genuinely thought he's exactly the kind of man to ditch (they've been on and off over and over since she was about 18/19). Alas, if anything it made him cling to her tighter. They had a very rushed wedding and this is their longest stint together without any breakups. Just over a year. There's still been the fair share of dramatics, of course, but I am surprised they've made it this far.\n\nEven so, I simply don't want to live with Aaron. I don't like him. I don't want him around me. I'd go above and beyond for my daughter and the baby, they can stay as long as they need, but not him. \n\nObviously, this has created a rift between my daughter and I. She doesn't want to live separately from Aaron. I told her then she needs to figure out alternative arrangements. Well, their move out date is rapidly approaching (the 15th of December) and they've still not been able to find a place, and she's panicking. She's been begging me to let them stay.\n\nI reiterated my terms. Aaron simply cannot stay here. This led to a lot of tears and some angry words. Namely, me being an asshole. I can genuinely see why she might think that, but I also have to think about myself and my own sanity. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1701971708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18d19q5/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_who_is_facing/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But it's valid not to want that in your home, and living with Aaron would probably tank your mental health.  In addition, if Aaron hasn't gotten his shit together by now, clearly there's something going on and he's not going to get his shit together any time soon.  If you let him in, he's going to try and stay in your house as long as he can, and it's unlikely he'll leave without a fight.  \n\nThe best thing you could do for your daughter would be getting her to leave Aaron, but unfortunately, she's not ready.  Keeping this boundary and keeping your home open to her and her child only may in fact work in the long-run when she's ready to leave because she will know she has a safe place open to her.\n\nBut until then, you're likely going to be kept away from your daughter and grandbaby.", "NTA but at the same time, be aware that he could use this to further isolate her from any support network by saying you don't care etc", "You did nothing wrong.
