In this time, we've had three different prior tenants' packages delivered to our address. \n\nThe second occasion was a particular mess because it was the tenant prior to us and the landlord gave them our name, address (obviously) and phone number without our consent or knowledge. This really pissed me off because she's a licensed realtor and clearly knows better. I woke up to some stranger banging on the door and screaming \"hello?!?\" on a Friday and simply ignored them until they left.\n\nThen the flood of texts came - from the landlord and the crazy prior tenant. I work very long hours in a restricted area so no phone access. When I saw the large amount of texts I simply responded that I have very limited availability and if they are expecting a package, feel free to pick it up from the patio. Apparently they wanted to serve as delivery notification service even though it was sent via UPS with a tracking number.\n\nAfter this mess I sent my landlord a polite but firm text saying do not, under any circumstances, provide my name, phone number, or address to anyone requesting it. She responded \"OK sorry\" and it's been radio silence ever since so my assumption is she's mad. Previously she would check in via text somewhat often but that hasn't happened in months. I'm seriously considering leaving a review on her realtor/brokerage website but won't until we've moved out.\n\nFour days ago another package was delivered to my residence with a third name. That tenant came by today, tells me about her package, and says there will be another tomorrow. She then asks me to take her number and text her when the package arrives. I wasn't comfortable with that arrangement for a few reasons\n\n* I generally don't want strangers having my name, phone number, and address\n* It's not my responsibility to keep these people informed of their delivery statuses\n* Some of these tenants haven't lived here for 2-3 years and yet still have packages delivered\n* There was no apology or mention of an inconvenience - more like a dictation of \"hey take my number and text me when this arrives\"\n\nI tell her it won't work due to work (I didn't want to tell her specifics about work schedules, etc.) and apologize. I then suggest she is free to pick up the next package when it's delivered in case I'm not home. She seemed mad about it and said something about \"I'll see if I can work it into my schedule to swing by\".\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* AITA for calling my landlord out about that breach of privacy? Should I leave a review or take action - I feel as a realtor she should know better.\n* AITA for refusing to be the package notification service for these prior tenants? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1701060077, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184ups3/aita_refusing_to_text_prior_tenants_about_their/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People are taking liberties requiring you to fulfill something that serves only them. You were gracious to invite them onto the patio for them to retrieve  and she had the gall to give you grief. \n\nYour landlord is crazy wrong giving out your contact information to a source you did not approve. There has to be a ethical and/or legal consequence to this in respect to her licensing board. Don't keep waiting for her to 'touch base'; you are a renter and do not need to placate this relationship.\n\nMoving forward: The moment a package is on your patio it stays there. You immediately call the carrier and request it be picked up. If the addressed recipient cannot make it your patio before the retrieval then that's on them.  Take care of you first. Several in this scenario are bulldozing you with demands, updates and requests; Not Your Problem. Also choose to not answer your door. Best to you.", "NTA on both counts. What your landlord did was a major breach of trust, and it's completely unreasonable for people to expect you to be their personal package receiver. Personally, I think the prior tenants are lucky that you didn't keep any of their packages.", " Nta and I have concerns. I\u2019d decline to have their parcels delivered at all and tell them they will be returned to sender.

I'm on your side here. You'd get like a month grace period with me, not 2\u20133 years. Anything beyond that is pure negligence for which I have no patience.\n\nBut I'm not convinced your landlord is pissed. I think you might have scared her! Again I'm on your side with this but based on the way every else has handled the situation in your story, I think it could have been an honest mistake on your landlord's part. I urge you to consider the rest of your rental experience before leaving a review.", "NTA in either event. Your landlord sounds like a presumptuous podunk asshole.

The packages could contain drugs and they are shipping them to your place so they don\u2019t leave a paper trail.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou are already speaking about moving, so I'll save that advice. None of this is normal. You might be dealing with drug mules or scam artists. Involve the Police before you get hit for money or drugs being sent to you.", "NTA, not your responsibility. Not your worry to think about. They want their package bad enough, they'll come get it. Just leave whatever wherever it gets delivered (if it doesn't have your name on it). Gets rained on, damaged... again, not yours. Now, after the suggestions... giving out someone's personal information is a huge breach of privacy and dangerous too. Who cares if she gets mad. She needs to stop and think about protecting her clients before she finds herself without any.", "NTA\n\nIf you're home when they're delivered, refuse to accept them. Can you call the delivery service and have the package removed since the intended recipient doesn't live there?\n\nYour landlord has no business giving out your information. I would check with a lawyer to see if it's even legal.", "Move it off the porch with a note saying person doesn't live here anymore, call the delivery service and tell them to pick up the mis delivered package.

Answering the door would have resolved that package situation immediately.\n\nPeople receiving packages are not always responsible for the sender using an old address and as housing affordability and predatory landlords becomes more of an issue, people living in and moving between rentals is going to become more of an issue in society. An issue that could one day affect one of your deliveries.\n\nMaybe just leave the packages in a spot out of sight and let the REA know that's were they will be and only the REA has your permission to retrieve them.", "No one should have given your personal info to someone else without your permission.
