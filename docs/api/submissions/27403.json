I am not the owner, but I have been with them since I was a teen and worked my way up to my current position. It\u2019s been the perfect job to pair with my classes. As the general manager, I do the scheduling as well as the hiring. The owners trust my judgment and let me hire/fire at my own discretion. \n\nLast week I hired a girl, 16, from the local highschool. She was extremely sweet and showed a willingness to work. Seems a little on the quiet side but this being her first job I think it\u2019s expected to an extent. There were zero tells/ mentions that she may be special needs. \n\n2 days after hiring her (she\u2019s not supposed to start until this upcoming week) her father came in and introduced himself to me. He was polite, and thanked me for hiring his daughter and left his phone number, telling me to call him after I\u2019m off. I was confused by this as I\u2019ve never dealt with a situation like this. But I did call him. \n\nHe thanked me again but then said his daughter has severe anxiety and a \u201cslow learner\u201d and that I need to make special accommodations for her. Here is what they are. \n\n- Do not schedule her for more than 3 hours at a time. \n\n- please allow her as many as she needs 10 minute breaks when she starts to appear overwhelmed. He said that if it is very busy, it is better to just let her sit in the back room and watch YouTube. \n\n- her school comes first (which I understand) but he said when she has \u201csignificant\u201d homework she will need to call off. \n\n- give her plenty of compliments and let the other staff know to go the extra mile to make her feel welcome. \n\n- if she does make a mistake, not to discuss it with her but to call him. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about employment law and not sure if I could be in legal trouble, but like every state we have at-will employment. I called the owner to tell him about this and he said to use my discretion. I want to call the father back and say I cannot make these accommodations, and if she does need these accommodations I will have to rescind the job offer. \n\nI feel for the girl, like I said she was very sweet. But at the same time I do have a business to run, I\u2019m not a special ed teacher. What is the point of hiring her when I will need to be over staffed to accommodate for her? I just can\u2019t do it. So right now I\u2019m thinking calling her dad tomorrow and letting him know that she will be treated like every other employee and if this won\u2019t work for her than she cannot work here. Would I be an asshole for that\n\nEdit: hey y\u2019all thanks for the input. I\u2019ve decided I am going to give her the job and just see how it goes.

Write down what you will say and do not deviate.  Explain that the position is not able to make those accommodations, and they were not included in any offer.  If she is able to meet a normal schedule and work conditions as the job requires you'll be happy to have her, otherwise you'll be unable to proceed with her employment.

Or simply pull the offer for undisclosed reasons, the position is no longer available, etc.\n\nGood luck.", "With it being her first job, it will be overwhelming. It will take coaching and redirection to develop her to the employee you would want her to be. Most states have laws stating minors can't work past so many hours.

Schedule her 2 to 3 days a week so it doesn't interfere with her schoolwork. \nWhen it comes to his request of discussing with him instead of her when she makes a mistake, that would make me question as to why. As an employee, she has to be able to take coaching given to her. I would call her and ask her to come in for a second interview and discuss your expectations then so she knows what you expect.", "YWBTA, but cite Dad as the problem, not the accommodations.\n\nDepending on what age of majority is in your state, the parent's consent can override the child's, so I would be a bit careful here.\n \nThis is a sticky situation. I think it would suck not to give the girl a chance; for all we know just some positive reinforcement is enough to compensate for all of dad's supposed concerns. But, on the other hand, do you want to be inviting Dad to be all up in your business for however long the girl is employed? If Dad is getting involved this early with unreasonable demands, what complaints/lawsuits is he going to fabricate in the future?\n\nI think the best course of action is to rescind the offer--provided the girl remains a minor in your state. You can tell the girl it is because her dad failed the interview. Minority and legal guardianship aside, it is quite clear that you are not hiring two people, nor do you need to accommodate whatever incompatibilities her domestic life creates with the job. You have PLENTY of notice to believe this is a bad fit, and it is not solely because of the requested accommodations.\n\nMaybe they will come back with a more reasonable proposition where dad minds his own business. Maybe they won't. Maybe they will figure this out with the next employer. But you don't need to be rolling over and opening yourself up for headaches and liability before they have figured their things out.", "NTA. I would probably just pretend like that was a fever dream that never happened, and treat her just like any other employee, because that's what she would be. I would not want to call her father and get into any kind of discussion with him. He really shouldn't have anything to do with the job, so why bring him into it? If he comes in again and complains about her being treated normally, then tell him that everyone is treated well, but the same, and you hope he can understand that her employment is between her and the store, not him. And, while you appreciate his business, this is the last time you will take any time out to discuss employment issues with him.", "NTA. If you have other employees and don't give them the accommodations that is illegal.", "At the moment, I'm going to say NTA- but I think you should also have a conversation with the girl, *and* an employment lawyer if at all possible. \n\nAs someone who is both physically disabled and has diagnosed anxiety & PTSD, the accommodations her father is asking for (demanding) are in fact *unreasonable*. Yes, the ADA does guarantee reasonable accommodations, but they have to be just that: reasonable. \n\nThis young woman is under 18yo, so legally she is in fact entitled to more breaks than an employee who is 18+, but here's the thing... if her shift is <4hrs, in most states, the employee is not legally entitled to *any* breaks. That 1st break doesn't kick in until your shift is scheduled for 4 entire hours. For a 16yo, I would probably give one 10 min break every 2 hours (which is what a previous supervisor of mine did for a barista who was 16.)\n\nBeing paid to sit in the back and watch YouTube is *absolutely not* a reasonable accommodation, and would pretty much ensure that the rest of the staff resented her (and you). Especially if she gets to do it during rush, when everyone else is working their asses off.\n\nWith my anxiety and PTSD, I made sure that my retail coworkers and supervisors knew that I had certain triggers, and might need to step in the back for 5-10 minutes to re-center, breathe, and collect myself somewhere quiet. And because I was up front with it, provided documentation, and never abused it (aka, tried to take the breaks when I didn't actually need it), no one ever had a problem. \n\nI'd set my watch for 5 minutes, and then take the time to get breathing under control, re-center, cry, whatever I needed... and then go back out and handle my business, because *I was being paid to do a job*.\n\nYes, I agree that school and education should come first... especially because she's under 18. But the ability to call off whenever she has \"significant\" homework, with zero parameters for what \"significant\" is or consequences is also not a reasonable accommodation. If working on school nights is a problem, then her availability should be weekends only. \n\n\"Give her lots of compliments\" reads like a parent who thinks their little darling is the specialist angel ever, and everyone needs to know it... if she cannot function without constant compliments, then she needs to work on that issue before entering the workforce, because that will not be the case. (That said, everyone should of course make her feel welcome and part of the team, because they should be doing that for every employee.)\n\nRefusing to allow her supervisor to directly correct any mistakes, incorrect actions, or to address performance improvement with an employee is *not a reasonable accommodation.* \n\nThere will be times where you NEED to directly address an issue, because no one is perfect, and you work in food service, which has all kinds of special rules and training, for health and safety reasons. Again, if she truly cannot handle being given constructive feedback, then she is not yet ready to enter the workforce. \n\nI would have a conversation with this young woman 1:1, because her father's behavior sounds very much like he's doing this behind her back. (If he were so concerned with her grades, he would have said, \"if it's busy and she gets overwhelmed, let her work on homework\" not YouTube. Which is still not reasonable, but less egregious.) It's very possible she'll say, \"I don't need any of that- though I may need reminding on correct policy a few extra times before it sticks\", or something similar. \n\nBut if she truly cannot do the job without these exact \"accommodations\", I would likely rescind the offer, as these are unreasonable, and would put undue stress on the rest of the team. She is absolutely entitled to reasonable accommodations, but that's not what these are.", "NTA.\n\nYou should give the girl a heads up that this interaction happened (she probably doesn't know) and ensure that she's ready to work as a normal employee without special treatment. \n\nIF you hear from the father again you should firmly tell him that you are employing the daughter not him, and that your interactions will be with the daughter and not him.", "NTA. Imagine if it were flipped. Being hired for a certain position for x amount of hours. Only afterwards the business says it will be entirely different.", "Call her in, tell her everything, ask for her honest opinion on how much of that coddling is needed, and go from there. Her dad's rules mean nothing at all, and the fact that he thinks he can order you around would be sufficient excuse to un-hire the daughter, but she should know why you're doing it.", "YWBTA if you take everything her dad says as gospel. I would bet she feels smothered and helicoptered by him. It's more complicated than if she were a legal adult, of course, but I'd recommend not going through dad on this. Hire her; you liked what you saw when it was just her. Treat her with the conditions required by law for a teen employee in your state (it will say how many hours, etc.). Other than that, treat her like anyone else (I mean, don't be a jerk, but don't treat her with special kid gloves) and see what happens. If she can't do it, or if her dad makes her quit, so be it, but for all we know, she might flourish away from the helicopter.", "YTA Do not rescind the order and do not call the dad back. He does not work for you. She got the job. She works the job. She hasn\u2019t asked for any accommodations. Just let her work and see how she does.

I tried to do what I was told, but it was the real season in retail and I didn\u2019t train for very long. The one and only time I got in trouble was when I was taking afew minutes too long in the back room. I specifically made sure I didn\u2019t tell the owner I was autistic during my interview since I knew they wouldn\u2019t wanna hire me. One mistake I did make, however, was telling them about my photographic memory. Apperently this meant I was supposed to be good at everything vision wise. Because my focus was never great, I wasn\u2019t quick to grab stuff out of the back room. On top of that I was in my 2nd week working there, so I was very distressed about it when my manager told me I shouldn\u2019t be spending more than a couple minutes grabbing items.\n\nI chose the place I worked at because I walked in and immediately thought the layout looked good to work in my condition. I love sorting and I\u2019m very meticulous. I solved a few different problems while I was there and managed to sell many items the customers weren\u2019t even looking for just based on my perception of them.\n\nI knew something was wrong when I was scheduled less and less hours. Every time I asked for more hours, I would get turned down. Every day someone told me I was doing a great job. I told a manager about the back room incident during a conversation while I apologized profusely for being back there for five minutes. She talked with the owner and the owner was complimenting me all the time after that as-well. I was trusted handling fragile things because of my crafting experience, maybe I tried to convince myself that was a good sign.\n\nCome Black Friday, I was told to stay behind the counter to bag supplies so I did. It wasn\u2019t a very big store so there weren\u2019t constant lines, but there was a chair behind the desk I often sat in while I was making ribbon bows, checking out, and doing the z-report. I didn\u2019t think it was a bad thing to sit down when convenient to, and no one ever told me it was. Later that day, after 10 hours, 2 hours over when my shift ended, after everything was put on shelves, my feet felt like they had knives going through them and I didn\u2019t think I had anything else to do before closing, as I had already vacuumed and the bathroom was clean. I sat down for fifteen seconds or so and another employee told the boss then she came and fired me immediately. I couldn\u2019t even face the thought of getting a job for almost a year after that. I\u2019m still wondering if I\u2019m good enough.\n\nMy point is, I enjoyed being independent, I thought I was a hard worker, I didn\u2019t think I had any accommodations made for me other than the back room, everyone complimented me and my work, even the owner did the day before she fired me with zero warning, at 17 years old.\n\nThat dad is in the wrong. You\u2019ll be in the wrong if you don\u2019t contact her. See what\u2019s really going on. 3 hours with as many 10 minute breaks as she wants is ridiculous in my opinion, but I am high functioning and the only breaks I ever had were bathroom breaks whenever I wanted, which I am grateful for because it\u2019s annoying to work with a full bladder.

Trust me, even I found it annoying. And the parents and schools do it in a way where they make sure you know you\u2019re different and still take the word of your bullies, talk down on you, take you out of classes you want, thank your best friends for liking you in the first place, try to give you fake friends, etc. I graduated a full year early and they still had the audacity to \u201coffer\u201d me a job at a temp agency for disabled individuals where I knew I\u2019d be treated differently than my neurotypical peers and the contract allowed my dad the option to sign it for me, thankfully I talked him down from it.

She didn\u2019t mention to you her issues which is weird. The father doing this without the daughter is sort of weird.", "So I have a little experience with something similar. I was a hotel manager and I was approached by a man who worked with special needs people who wanted to work jobs. He was interested in if I would hire a young girl, around 20, who was mentally around the age of a pre-teen due to a brain injury. Since a hotel has basic cleaning tasks, he thought it would be a good fit. He said that he would be in and out to keep up with her progress. Her mother was also involved in the process. At first, it worked well. She basically helped fold laundry, do minor cleaning tasks, and assist the executive housekeeper. But soon, things devolved rapidly. At times, she wouldn\u2019t want to do the tasks assigned to her. She\u2019d be found sleeping in the laundry room. She would get very irate when she didn\u2019t get her way. But what became worse was the guy who was supposed to be watching her. He would come in and go directly to the staff, instead of speaking with me like requested. He would berate the staff for not having her do harder tasks and ask all kinds of personal questions of them. He wanted her and my staff to do videos and photos of her working but wanted it to seem like she was cleaning an entire room alone. Finally the staff broke down and told me what was going on. While we all loved the girl and wished her the best, we had to let her go. While I understand that people with mental disabilities would like to have jobs, it is important that a) they are in jobs that play to their strengths, b) that the disability and special requirements are known prior to hiring to see if they can be accommodated, c) the person can be communicated with and if another party is involved, that this person is easy to contact and willing to work with the company instead of against it. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, an employee with a disability and a need of special requirements must tell the employer at the time of interview. If the employer can reasonably met those requests without it having an averse effect on the business, then they must accommodate them. You can\u2019t hire someone who can\u2019t work when it\u2019s busy and who can take as many breaks as they want. You basically would be paying someone to hang out and occasionally work then they felt like it.", "NTA\n\nHer dad shouldn't have done what he did.  She could've disclosed her disabilities to you if she wanted to.\n\nChances are that she may be absolutely fine.

Some either care so much that they hinder any kind of independence from ever being gained, and some care so little that they won\u2019t be involved in the process whatsoever. Thankfully most of the parents are in a middle ground and are willing to work with me. \n\nTo answer your question, I think to take away the opportunity would make you an asshole, but this doesn\u2019t mean that you have to give this person all accommodations that the dad requests.

I have multiple individuals that fall into this category. \n\n-If you are in the US, every state should have their own department for disabilities that actually works to assist in these situations. However, the parent and individual are the ones who would need to request assistance from the state department in order to get the proper services such as employment or mental health services. \n\n-It won\u2019t be comfortable, but you absolutely have the ability to say that YouTube breaks are not a reasonable accommodation. Shorter shifts is a fairly common accommodation typically due to attention span, anxiety spikes, or physical limitations.\n\n-in my experience, I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s best to completely rely on the father for correcting mistakes within the workplace. This should probably be a collaborative effort between you and the dad to ensure she actually learns from her mistakes. \n\n-One of the best impacts these people tend to have is a caring and genuine manager / supervisor. As long as you are trying your best to work with them and help them understand each aspect of their job and how to improve. That\u2019s the biggest importance in my eyes. \n\n-The reality is that while reasonable accommodations can be met, sometimes individuals are just not a fit for the position. I\u2019ve had workplaces tell me that they will essentially need to fire an individual, but feared the legality. As long as you went through the same routine as you would for any employee (along with reasonable accommodations), it\u2019s still very normal and understandable to have to let an individual go if they can not meet the level of work you require. \n\nI hope this helps and I can try to answer anything more if you have additional questions.", "Shame on you", "NTA\n\nWhat is it with people thinking jobs like this are just a free-paycheck for their kid?

And from my experience (as well as trained as a SPED teacher) I would feel very confident to say the anxiety and shyness is almost 100% because of the parents. Yes, some nature is in play, not all nurture, being she was probably born a sweet and mild mannered person to begin with, but the input from the parents has turned it into some shy and anxious characteristics. And once the parents instilled these characteristics, recognized them, and used it as a reason to be even more overbearing. Like parents be: *be so overbearing to your daughter that she\u2019s now shy and has a lot of anxiety* parents: \u2018oh hey our daughter has anxiety issues and is super shy, idk why, but l that means I should be even more involved to protect them\u2019. \n\nIt\u2019s all coming from a place of love. Naturally you want to give your child the best, safest, perfect environment, and when they struggle, you wanna fight so it\u2019s not an issue and take that struggle away from them. \n\nAll that being said. I would look at this as an opportunity. For both this young employee and yourself. Yes it\u2019ll take some more effort on your end, temporarily, but the potential payout could be significant. Again for both parties involved. \n\nTreat her with respect. As in don\u2019t talk with her dad, talk with her. But not about anything her dad told you. Welcome her in like any other employee. However, for the first few months take extra steps to set her up for success. If there are know hours where it gets busy, makes sure the other people scheduled are reliable and can manage if she\u2019s struggling to keep up at first, maybe even add an hour or two to someone else\u2019s schedule to make sure things are covered. Beyond that try to schedule her for the slowest hours at first, so that you and others can give her plenty of time to train without any chaos. Give her a few months of that before getting her on a regular schedule. Be encouraging. Still held responsible but encouraging. Basically give her some mentorship while introducing her to a new world of employment and such. She probably badly needs someone to help build confidence and simultaneously treat her like an adult. \n\nThis could greatly benefit her! But as I said early, not just her, but you as well. \n\nIn my experience the effort you put into cases like this, you\u2019ll get a tenfold out of in through a highly efficient, hard working, dedicated, professional, low to no mistakes or problems, employee. \n\nIn college I had a serving job, and the restaurant worked with the local high school SPED program to employ their students. One kid started as a dishwasher and definitely had some overbearing parents, routinely trying to talk to the owner about all these things their son \u2018couldn\u2019t handle\u2019. And granted it was rough when this kid for the first few months. But the owner and head chef said basically screw that to his dad, and helped trained the kid. Really invested in him. Just over a year later the same kid was a line chef. His dad who catering chef, came in to yell at the owner saying his son couldn\u2019t manage being a line chef and how dare he overwork his son. Owner said prove it. Challenged the dad to work the line on a busy night along with his son to see who could keep up with the orders. The son completely dominated over his dad. Now the same kid who the parents said would never live independently got a scholarship to a culinary college and been loving college life. \n\nBasically yes it would be easiest to just rescind the job offer.
