I am not the owner, but I have been with them since I was a teen and worked my way up to my current position. It\u2019s been the perfect job to pair with my classes. As the general manager, I do the scheduling as well as the hiring. The owners trust my judgment and let me hire/fire at my own discretion. \n\nLast week I hired a girl, 16, from the local highschool. She was extremely sweet and showed a willingness to work. Seems a little on the quiet side but this being her first job I think it\u2019s expected to an extent. There were zero tells/ mentions that she may be special needs. \n\n2 days after hiring her (she\u2019s not supposed to start until this upcoming week) her father came in and introduced himself to me. He was polite, and thanked me for hiring his daughter and left his phone number, telling me to call him after I\u2019m off. I was confused by this as I\u2019ve never dealt with a situation like this. But I did call him. \n\nHe thanked me again but then said his daughter has severe anxiety and a \u201cslow learner\u201d and that I need to make special accommodations for her. Here is what they are. \n\n- Do not schedule her for more than 3 hours at a time. \n\n- please allow her as many as she needs 10 minute breaks when she starts to appear overwhelmed. He said that if it is very busy, it is better to just let her sit in the back room and watch YouTube. \n\n- her school comes first (which I understand) but he said when she has \u201csignificant\u201d homework she will need to call off. \n\n- give her plenty of compliments and let the other staff know to go the extra mile to make her feel welcome. \n\n- if she does make a mistake, not to discuss it with her but to call him. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about employment law and not sure if I could be in legal trouble, but like every state we have at-will employment. I called the owner to tell him about this and he said to use my discretion. I want to call the father back and say I cannot make these accommodations, and if she does need these accommodations I will have to rescind the job offer. \n\nI feel for the girl, like I said she was very sweet. But at the same time I do have a business to run, I\u2019m not a special ed teacher. What is the point of hiring her when I will need to be over staffed to accommodate for her? I just can\u2019t do it. So right now I\u2019m thinking calling her dad tomorrow and letting him know that she will be treated like every other employee and if this won\u2019t work for her than she cannot work here. Would I be an asshole for that\n\nEdit: hey y\u2019all thanks for the input. I\u2019ve decided I am going to give her the job and just see how it goes. If she can\u2019t handle it I\u2019ll just let her go.", "created_utc": 1695397496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pdns1/wibta_if_i_rescind_a_job_offer_that_i_previously/", "score": 199, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Write down what you will say and do not deviate.  Explain that the position is not able to make those accommodations, and they were not included in any offer.

As an employee, she has to be able to take coaching given to her. I would call her and ask her to come in for a second interview and discuss your expectations then so she knows what you expect.", "YWBTA, but cite Dad as the problem, not the accommodations.\n\nDepending on what age of majority is in your state, the parent's consent can override the child's, so I would be a bit careful here.\n \nThis is a sticky situation. I think it would suck not to give the girl a chance; for all we know just some positive reinforcement is enough to compensate for all of dad's supposed concerns. But, on the other hand, do you want to be inviting Dad to be all up in your business for however long the girl is employed? If Dad is getting involved this early with unreasonable demands, what complaints/lawsuits is he going to fabricate in the future?\n\nI think the best course of action is to rescind the offer--provided the girl remains a minor in your state. You can tell the girl it is because her dad failed the interview. Minority and legal guardianship aside, it is quite clear that you are not hiring two people, nor do you need to accommodate whatever incompatibilities her domestic life creates with the job. You have PLENTY of notice to believe this is a bad fit, and it is not solely because of the requested accommodations.\n\nMaybe they will come back with a more reasonable proposition where dad minds his own business. Maybe they won't. Maybe they will figure this out with the next employer. But you don't need to be rolling over and opening yourself up for headaches and liability before they have figured their things out.", "NTA. I would probably just pretend like that was a fever dream that never happened, and treat her just like any other employee, because that's what she would be. I would not want to call her father and get into any kind of discussion with him. He really shouldn't have anything to do with the job, so why bring him into it? If he comes in again and complains about her being treated normally, then tell him that everyone is treated well, but the same, and you hope he can understand that her employment is between her and the store, not him. And, while you appreciate his business, this is the last time you will take any time out to discuss employment issues with him.", "NTA. If you have other employees and don't give them the accommodations that is illegal.", "At the moment, I'm going to say NTA- but I think you should also have a conversation with the girl, *and* an employment lawyer if at all possible. \n\nAs someone who is both physically disabled and has diagnosed anxiety & PTSD, the accommodations her father is asking for (demanding) are in fact *unreasonable*. Yes, the ADA does guarantee reasonable accommodations, but they have to be just that: reasonable. \n\nThis young woman is under 18yo, so legally she is in fact entitled to more breaks than an employee who is 18+, but here's the thing... if her shift is <4hrs, in most states, the employee is not legally entitled to *any* breaks. That 1st break doesn't kick in until your shift is scheduled for 4 entire hours. For a 16yo, I would probably give one 10 min break every 2 hours (which is what a previous supervisor of mine did for a barista who was 16.)\n\nBeing paid to sit in the back and watch YouTube is *absolutely not* a reasonable accommodation, and would pretty much ensure that the rest of the staff resented her (and you). Especially if she gets to do it during rush, when everyone else is working their asses off.\n\nWith my anxiety and PTSD, I made sure that my retail coworkers and supervisors knew that I had certain triggers, and might need to step in the back for 5-10 minutes to re-center, breathe, and collect myself somewhere quiet. And because I was up front with it, provided documentation, and never abused it (aka, tried to take the breaks when I didn't actually need it), no one ever had a problem. \n\nI'd set my watch for 5 minutes, and then take the time to get breathing under control, re-center, cry, whatever I needed... and then go back out and handle my business, because *I was being paid to do a job*.\n\nYes, I agree that school and education should come first... especially because she's under 18. But the ability to call off whenever she has \"significant\" homework, with zero parameters for what \"significant\" is or consequences is also not a reasonable accommodation. If working on school nights is a problem, then her availability should be weekends only. \n\n\"Give her lots of compliments\" reads like a parent who thinks their little darling is the specialist angel ever, and everyone needs to know it... if she cannot function without constant compliments, then she needs to work on that issue before entering the workforce, because that will not be the case. (That said, everyone should of course make her feel welcome and part of the team, because they should be doing that for every employee.)\n\nRefusing to allow her supervisor to directly correct any mistakes, incorrect actions, or to address performance improvement with an employee is *not a reasonable accommodation.* \n\nThere will be times where you NEED to directly address an issue, because no one is perfect, and you work in food service, which has all kinds of special rules and training, for health and safety reasons. Again, if she truly cannot handle being given constructive feedback, then she is not yet ready to enter the workforce. \n\nI would have a conversation with this young woman 1:1, because her father's behavior sounds very much like he's doing this behind her back. (If he were so concerned with her grades, he would have said, \"if it's busy and she gets overwhelmed, let her work on homework\" not YouTube. Which is still not reasonable, but less egregious.) It's very possible she'll say, \"I don't need any of that- though I may need reminding on correct policy a few extra times before it sticks\", or something similar. \n\nBut if she truly cannot do the job without these exact \"accommodations\", I would likely rescind the offer, as these are unreasonable, and would put undue stress on the rest of the team. She is absolutely entitled to reasonable accommodations, but that's not what these are.", "NTA.\n\nYou should give the girl a heads up that this interaction happened (she probably doesn't know) and ensure that she's ready to work as a normal employee without special treatment. \n\nIF you hear from the father again you should firmly tell him that you are employing the daughter not him, and that your interactions will be with the daughter and not him.", "NTA. Imagine if it were flipped. Being hired for a certain position for x amount of hours. Only afterwards the business says it will be entirely different.", "Call her in, tell her everything, ask for her honest opinion on how much of that coddling is needed, and go from there. Her dad's rules mean nothing at all, and the fact that he thinks he can order you around would be sufficient excuse to un-hire the daughter, but she should know why you're doing it.", "YWBTA if you take everything her dad says as gospel. I would bet she feels smothered and helicoptered by him. It's more complicated than if she were a legal adult, of course, but I'd recommend not going through dad on this. Hire her; you liked what you saw when it was just her. Treat her with the conditions required by law for a teen employee in your state (it will say how many hours, etc.). Other than that, treat her like anyone else (I mean, don't be a jerk, but don't treat her with special kid gloves) and see what happens. If she can't do it, or if her dad makes her quit, so be it, but for all we know, she might flourish away from the helicopter.", "YTA Do not rescind the order and do not call the dad back. He does not work for you. She got the job. She works the job. She hasn\u2019t asked for any accommodations. Just let her work and see how she does. The father was out of line to interfere.", "Nta, but I'd give her a chance. As a parent of an adult with specific needs, I would never have undermined them in this way. I know what support is, and this feels like overstepping. The parent should not have this conversation without the daughter present.

She may can do a lot more than he thinks.", "Sounds like he\u2019s trying to sabotage her job search.", "I didn't read all of the replies so someone may have already suggested to you, or you may already know of \"Ask a manager\" website. https://www.askamanager.org\n\nIt's a super good resource. You may even find it here on reddit, I've just never looked because it's one or my saves. Best to you and the youngling.", "I understand everyone's sentiment to cut dad out of the equation, but given that she's 16, doesn't she need parental permission to work? She's a minor and presumably can't make decisions on her own yet. I'm not an HR person, but those accommodations sound far from reasonable.", "True I guess. If I worked there and they employed them, I'd be looking for a new job asap. Unless I too was allowed to watch YouTube during the busy periods rather than, ya know, doing what I'm being paid to do", "Please explain your point of view.  I genuinely want to know. How is it \"blatant discrimination\" to follow EEOC rules?  Why is is unfair for a potential employer to ask if you will be able to perform the job? Is it more fair for employer to hire someone and only to have it disclosed afterwards that the new employee can't do a key portion of job?  If I hire a filing clerk and the files are upstairs (no elevator) and you have to climb a ladder (yes this was a real situation) to access files, I need to know before hiring that you can't climb stairs or ladders. Otherwise the job isn't a good fit for either of us.", ">I\u2019m not a special ed teacher.\n\nLOL.", "I mean obviously, since she works in a froyo shop. Doesn\u2019t make it not ableist and rude to say it though. Fat people are fat, but I don\u2019t go up to them and say, \u201cHey, your fat.\u201d Because it\u2019s rude. Some people are ugly. But I don\u2019t go up to them and say, \u201cDude, you\u2019re ugly.\u201d Because it\u2019s rude. Some people are poor, but I don\u2019t go up and say, \u201cHey, I have more money than you, brokie!\u201d \nJust because something is \u201ctrue\u201d doesn\u2019t get rid of the mean spirited intent behind saying it.", "You may have options. I'd start by reviewing the ADA web page: [https://www.eeoc.gov/publications/ada-your-employment-rights-individual-disability](https://www.eeoc.gov/publications/ada-your-employment-rights-individual-disability). You may be able to rescind or modify the job offer because it is the applicant's responsibility to disclose that accommodations are needed, and the accommodations requested by the dad are, mostly, unreasonable.", "I assume she has her parents permission because she came in for the interview. It\u2019s not like I need it in writing", "Because in practice, even if that person\u2019s disabilities have no impact on their job performance in that particular role, what incentive do they have to hire them over someone who is fully able bodied? That\u2019s the discrimination. For your example- that\u2019s not an unreasonable ask. But you should be very clear in the interview process. The problem is that cases like yours pave the way for less-than-reasonable employers to follow. \u201cOh we can\u2019t hire that person in the wheelchair to be a cashier , they need to stand for their job\u201d or \u201ca deaf person can\u2019t be a teacher, they need to hear what their students are saying\u201d both of these are bullshit. Disabled people\u2019s lives matter. They should be accommodated and to not do so is immoral. People don\u2019t ask to be disabled. All they want is to work and contribute to society and it\u2019s idiotic to not let them be part of the workforce. It\u2019s not that expensive to put in a ramp or use bigger type or let people sit down while working or give people direct feedback or let them work from home or let them wear more comfortable clothes or hell even arrange some filing cabinets to be moved etc etc. Let the government pay for that with the money they save on disability payments that half the time would be unnecessary if employers actually let people with disabilities work.", ">if she does make a mistake, not to discuss it with her but to call him.\n\nThis is not an employee requesting accommodations. OP is responding to a father requesting accommodations that, among others, include the employer not managing the employee but going through their father.", "You're looking for a reason to be mad, at this point. The fact of the matter is that the OP isn't a special ED instructor, and it is not their job, as this girl's boss, to help her find ways to manage her anxiety. If it is as bad as the girl's dad says it is, there is every chance that the girl does have a PED, with accommodations like what the dad is asking of OP. The OP isn't doing anything ableist by saying that it isn't his responsibility to accommodate this girl's anxiety, because it isn't.", "I don't think YOU need it in writing, but the owner of the yogurt shop may need it. I'm assuming this would come in the form of some kind of work permit.", "Based on Dad's behavior, my assumption would be she has his *very* conditional permission. He's going to stay involved, and he's her father. So I'd probably cut bait or you're going to be dealing with him the whole time. Especially since you cannot reasonably make his demanded accommodations.", "I completely agree that if a disability has no impact on what I need an employee to do, then it has no barring on my hiring decision.  In reality, I might be swayed in that person's favor since they (may in my experience) be a more loyal employee because of my willingness to give them a chance.\n\nI agree with most of your examples.  Putting in a ramp or allowing someone to sit is completely reasonable.  If I was hiring a teacher and my applicant was deaf, I would have to ask what accommodations they would need to do the job, because I honestly don't know.\n\nI think employers get frustrated by the (hopefully minority) of people who don't disclose any issues before hiring then expect excessive concessions (like the ones the Dad was asking for in this post). Or are afraid that they will be sued if they can't make the position work.", "Sorry you're confused. I'm not arguing any of that. And it's not my point.\n\nOP asked if AITA and is open about their bigotry against people who need accommodations and \"I'm not a special ed teacher.\" \n\nThat alone is YTA.", "I am worried about that. Idk just how much he\u2019s going to attempt to insert himself into this", "I am not confused. \n\nI agree that the special education sentence is an TA thing to say/write. I don\u2019t think think it means that the employer is screaming discrimination when taken in context of the father\u2019s communication."]}
