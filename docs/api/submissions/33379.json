Besides all you have to pack no one wants to expose their baby to a large number of people with possible winter illnesses. A new baby at a family event usually ends up with baby getting passed around. Some are ok with that and some are not. Hold off until next Christmas. \n\nDon't stress about baby not sleeping through the night at 6 months. None of the baby's I have raised slept through the night until on solid foods and it was usually only 6 hours at most in the beginning Not the solid 8 I'm sure you are craving. \n\nYou are doing the right thing for you!", "NTA\n\nIf you have a baby they need to be at home, especially if settling into a sleep routine is being challenging.\n\nTell them that they can drop by for a visit on boxing day afternoon at a convenient time for your child's sleep schedule. Outside that they  can whistle for it. \n\nIf they whine about the inconvenience then point out how much worse it is with a baby and hang up.\n\nBabies and travelling = 10x more stuff than 2 adults and a huge amount of faffing about. Plus disruption of schedules, feeding and sleeping. Oh and lets hope they don't get car sick ...", "NTA - You're not the asshole for prioritizing your family's well-being and setting boundaries. It's reasonable to want a peaceful Christmas at home, especially given the lack of consistent support from your extended family. Communicate your feelings honestly with your parents and emphasize the need for understanding. Taking care of your son and maintaining a routine is crucial, and it's okay to prioritize that over accommodating last-minute requests.", "NTA \n\nThey are being BEYOND unreasonable. \n\nWhy do they think it\u2019s okay to demand you come to them? They should be coming to you, if anything! \n\nIt is totally ok to not want visitors during this time. Your baby isn\u2019t even sleeping throughout the night!\n\nSeparately, it\u2019s OK to have your own traditions. If your tradition is just you, your husband and baby on Christmas, that\u2019s OK.", "I don\u2019t know why you got into an \u201cabandonment\u201d argument. You already told everyone you weren\u2019t going anywhere with the baby, you and your husband want to have Christmas Day at home, and you\u2019d be willing to arrange something for CE. or Boxing Day. So, the answer to your mother\u2019s Christmas Day invitation is no. The end. NTA", "NTA. They want to be there for the \u201cspecial\u201d days, but not the difficult times? Nope. F that.", "NTA I am doing the same with my 6 month old. I am so annoyed with adults putting their wants over my child's needs. We are so happy with out little bundle of joy and so excited to celebrate this holiday with our little family! The manipulation and guilt trips we are getting are having the opposite affect than desired. \n\nWe offered my mother-in-law to do Christmas on the 23. They get to celebrate \"first\" but because MIL can't show off our baby to family friends, that isn't good enough. My family live out of state and can't visit until my baby is 9 months. Idgaf about MIL friends getting to meet him when my mom and sisters haven't. \n\nBut seriously you're an adult. Make your decisions and tell people \"It's too much for us to pack up our baby and keep a schedule around a bunch or people. We appreciate that you respect our decisions.\" And then ignore them and enjoy your life.", "NTA. My parents lived a mile from me and my in-laws 10 minutes away and even that was a nightmare when our kid was little. It's just hard on them, it's loud and there's a lot going on and their routines are disrupted and it isn't really enjoyable for anyone. We decided to do one family a day and had them come over and made it a nice event instead of a rushed, cranky nightmare.", "NTA.  Mom is out to lunch.  Her failure to support your decision makes her asshole worthy.  I agree with all of your suppositions.  But, even if I didn't ... Mom & Dad call the shots.  There is no incident in which that precept will vary.  Do what you want, Mom.  All three of you will benefit from your commitment to the welfare of your immediate family.  Merry Christmas!", "Definitely not. Your child, your Christmas and the first one together too. The grandparents can wait.", "From a purely logical standpoint, this is a bad idea. You\u2019d be talking an infant on a 2 hour round trip car ride to visit people whose health status is unknown. In the US at least, Covid is showing a resurgence and RSV is rampant along with multiple  viral illnesses. that alone is a no in my book. NTA.", "It\u2019s not worth trying to explain yourself to people like this. Next time just say no. They don\u2019t need an explanation. NTA", ">For months we have told each set of parents that we are not travelling this Christmas and want to relax at home and if anyone wants to see him, we can arrange something for Christmas Eve or Boxing Day etc.\n\nNTA. You told everyone your Christmas schedule, which gave them the option to visit you the days before and after Christmas. They don't like the options and are coming up with all sorts of excuses \"these people you only see once a year want to meet the baby\" why you should change your plans to suit them. Don't do it. \n\nStick to your plan and make a ton of memories at home with your son on his first Christmas. He's too young to remember any of it, so it's up to your and your husband to remember how much fun it was for all of you.", "NTA They aren\u2019t making an effort and then making excuses blaming you for why they aren\u2019t. Then they want YOU to make an effort to see them? Nah. You have a full plate. In this season of life, people need to come to you. Eventually you will be able to return to a giving role, but having a six month old ain\u2019t the time. \n\nOn top of everything - the last place I would want my baby right now is in a larger gathering with a bunch of travelers\u2026\n\nMaybe you can FaceTime them or something. NTA and don\u2019t let them guilt you.", "NTA - A six month old doesn\u2019t need to be exposed to your entire extended family in peak illness season anyway. If one side of the family has been able to make contact and visits happen and friends of your family are able to make it happen too? That tells you all you need to know. Don\u2019t feel bad about it. You might want to check out r/absentgrandparents here at Reddit, if you haven\u2019t already. \n\nEvery baby is different so I can\u2019t guarantee this will work for you but I swore by the baby whisperer method to get my kids to sleep through the night. You should also speak to your paediatrician to find out if you can change your feeding programme/schedule, sometimes that makes a huge difference in their ability to make it closer to 8hrs.", "NTA at all.  I would feel so disconnected from them as well.  And packing up a baby with all the stuff you need?  Just no.", "NTA. enjoy your Christmas without any BS. Make new traditions", "Nta what part of 'we're not traveling' do they not understand?", "NTA\nThey're the kind of people that will kiss the baby with their nasty mouths and get him sick anyway. No boundaries nor good-hearted people", "Extreme NTA - even without the lack of interest they've shown so far, it's your decision what to do on Xmas and you gave them an alternative.  Enjoy Xmas without family drama", "NTA", "When's the last time you contacted an extended family member about their kids? How often are you otherwise in touch with extended family? When did you last talk or ask them about their lives?\n\nINFO", "NTA and you never will be for prioritizing your nuclear family, which is now your husband and child(ren possibly).", "You gave them agenda, enough said. If they really want to see the baby you gave them the time", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve pointed out that if they want to see your baby, they can make arrangements to do exactly that. End of discussion.\n\nEnjoy your Christmas with your husband and your son, OP. I hope it\u2019s wonderful.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s totally reasonable to want to stay home on Christmas Day and not travel anywhere with a baby. It can be a lot and at that young you definitely don\u2019t want to risk him catching anything so totally reasonable.\n\nBut for you feeling disconnected\u2026are you generally a family that checks in often? That visits often? Did you check in often when others had kids? I know every family is different but I know if one of my cousins had a baby, I\u2019d be getting most updates from my mom who\u2019d be getting them from my aunt, and I probably wouldn\u2019t be the one initiating a visit. We\u2019re close but in a catch up at family gatherings and like each others instagram posts kind of way. Even my brother\u2019s babies, I waited to be invited over and just messaged my brother to let me know if they needed anything. Space is definitely the norm in my family with a new baby. So I just wonder if maybe your family is trying to give space and not realizing it\u2019s bothering you.", "NTA", "NTA but I think you're looking at this wrong. Here is a one shot easy way for you to catch up with all these family members. Now they'll feel more connected and it will be easier to stay in touch going forward. You can even say that you've missed them and felt abandoned. Honestly, let them know how you feel. \n\nTurning your back because you're disappointed in them is hurting you too.", "NTA", "You're complaining because **extended** family didn't stop down and redirect their whole lives around your pregnancy/birth and newborn? Seriously?\n\nNAH I guess but you're a bit much.  Your idea to stay home for Christmas is fine.  Your mother floated a chance for more socializing, and you can certainly decline.  \n\nIt's pretty rude to jump on your soapbox with that attitude about what everyone has or hasn't done for you though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

LOL.\n\nOur daughter was actually born Dec 17th and we still did not visit... we didn't even celebrate that year, because we were basically comatose. \n\nAnyways. No one has a right to see your child, holidays or not. Enjoy your first little family Christmas.", "NTA. It sounds like they feel entitled to see him only at their convenience. It is not the obligation of a new mom (or any parents really) to make their having a newborn convenient for other people. Should be the other way around.", "I\u2019ve been there with family in the past, and now again with our 7 month old. And let me tell you, I\u2019ve never regretted spending my Christmas at home with my own little family. Even if we do nothing but watch Christmas movies and eat snacks all day- that time is precious. \nBe kind and clear- \u201c Thank you for the invite, but we have already made our Christmas plan. Perhaps we can get together at another time.\u201d\nEnjoy your first Christmas with your little one in peace!", "It's ok to feel disappointed but do not feel defeated.  You and DH are the parents and you set the agenda with your child.  Just because it's Christmas does not mean your child becomes everyone's play thing for the holidays.  If your husband's family can make time to contact you and follow your boundaries, your own family should be able to do it as well.  They fact that most of them have not contacted you over the past 6 months tells you all you need to know regarding their priorities and their view of you.  Why must you pack up a 6 month old and take him somewhere else just because your family cannot be bothered to make time to see/call you?  I know it's hard but don't let it bother you and hold fast to your boundaries.  When your family proves they want to be involved in your life, then maybe you can make an effort to see them.  NTA", "NTA- family isn\u2019t automatically entitled to your time just because it\u2019s the holidays.  You can choose to prioritize your family- your husband and yourself.  There\u2019s a whole entire holiday season where you can choose to see people, and everyone that really cares about bonding with the baby is better off with one on one time than seeing the kiddo in a huge, overstimulating party", "NTA \n\nThe road runs both ways and the phone lines do too.

Its not unusual not want to travel with an infant.", "NTA.  Your family will be staying at home this year on Christmas Day to spend time as a family. Your EXTENDED family were informed when visiting would be possible but they decided to ignore it.  The trash talking is not a great look for them and I would ignore anyone who is talking crap about you and block them.", "NTA These people are only interested in you and your baby when other people can see them being interested. You've been crystal clear about the lack of interest both before and after your babies birth. This is a hill to die on. Don't let people who can't even send you a text let you feel like you're doing something wrong.", "NTA- your parents are saying that bs so they can see him without going to the trouble of coming over. So nope, they can either take what you offered or wait til later.", "NTA. \nTell your parents there are weekends and holidays for visits, and texting/calling can happen at almost anytime. \"Hi OP, I'd like to call/FaceTime, what time would best suit you?\" That's how easy it is. \nI've learned not to put energy into visiting those who can't be bothered outside of birthdays and holidays. They know where you live and have your numbers.", "It\u2019s up to you \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I would never fault a parent for making these kinds of decisions about a newborn. Anyone who gives you are hard time is an asshole.", "You are making the distance more", "I wanted to address the sleeping thing too. Infants have very small stomachs and are very prone to low blood sugar. They should not be sleeping through the night! They need to eat every two to three hours. That period slowly gets longer as they get older, but they will still generally only sleep for 6 hours at a time. If you're trying to put them down for the night at 6 or 7pm, you're doing yourself a disservice. They are going to wake up reliably around midnight to 1am ready to start the day. I would do a little research and revisit the bedtime routine.", "Also, in the last 6 months has OP actually invited any extended family over to meet her child? Or attempted to make any arrangements with them for a weekend visit?", "As a new, first time mom myself, today's first time moms think the rest of the world stops and is supposed to revolve around them. It's maddening. \n\nNot one of my aunts or uncles asked me about specific details of my pregnancy or birth because why would they. But I happily took my 6 month old to all family holidays because I want him to be loved by and attached to his family members. It's only damaging the baby's future relationships to isolate them. My 6 month old facially recognizes my parents more than my 18 month old niece bc my sister never brings her kids around."]}
