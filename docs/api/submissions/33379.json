Besides all you have to pack no one wants to expose their baby to a large number of people with possible winter illnesses. A new baby at a family event usually ends up with baby getting passed around. Some are ok with that and some are not. Hold off until next Christmas. \n\nDon't stress about baby not sleeping through the night at 6 months. None of the baby's I have raised slept through the night until on solid foods and it was usually only 6 hours at most in the beginning Not the solid 8 I'm sure you are craving. \n\nYou are doing the right thing for you!", "NTA\n\nIf you have a baby they need to be at home, especially if settling into a sleep routine is being challenging.\n\nTell them that they can drop by for a visit on boxing day afternoon at a convenient time for your child's sleep schedule. Outside that they  can whistle for it. \n\nIf they whine about the inconvenience then point out how much worse it is with a baby and hang up.\n\nBabies and travelling = 10x more stuff than 2 adults and a huge amount of faffing about. Plus disruption of schedules, feeding and sleeping. Oh and lets hope they don't get car sick ...", "NTA - You're not the asshole for prioritizing your family's well-being and setting boundaries. It's reasonable to want a peaceful Christmas at home, especially given the lack of consistent support from your extended family. Communicate your feelings honestly with your parents and emphasize the need for understanding. Taking care of your son and maintaining a routine is crucial, and it's okay to prioritize that over accommodating last-minute requests.", "NTA \n\nThey are being BEYOND unreasonable. \n\nWhy do they think it\u2019s okay to demand you come to them? They should be coming to you, if anything! \n\nIt is totally ok to not want visitors during this time. Your baby isn\u2019t even sleeping throughout the night!\n\nSeparately, it\u2019s OK to have your own traditions. If your tradition is just you, your husband and baby on Christmas, that\u2019s OK.", "I don\u2019t know why you got into an \u201cabandonment\u201d argument. You already told everyone you weren\u2019t going anywhere with the baby, you and your husband want to have Christmas Day at home, and you\u2019d be willing to arrange something for CE. or Boxing Day. So, the answer to your mother\u2019s Christmas Day invitation is no. The end. NTA", "NTA. They want to be there for the \u201cspecial\u201d days, but not the difficult times? Nope. F that.", "NTA I am doing the same with my 6 month old. I am so annoyed with adults putting their wants over my child's needs. We are so happy with out little bundle of joy and so excited to celebrate this holiday with our little family! The manipulation and guilt trips we are getting are having the opposite affect than desired. \n\nWe offered my mother-in-law to do Christmas on the 23. They get to celebrate \"first\" but because MIL can't show off our baby to family friends, that isn't good enough. My family live out of state and can't visit until my baby is 9 months. Idgaf about MIL friends getting to meet him when my mom and sisters haven't. \n\nBut seriously you're an adult. Make your decisions and tell people \"It's too much for us to pack up our baby and keep a schedule around a bunch or people. We appreciate that you respect our decisions.\" And then ignore them and enjoy your life.", "NTA. My parents lived a mile from me and my in-laws 10 minutes away and even that was a nightmare when our kid was little. It's just hard on them, it's loud and there's a lot going on and their routines are disrupted and it isn't really enjoyable for anyone. We decided to do one family a day and had them come over and made it a nice event instead of a rushed, cranky nightmare.", "NTA.  Mom is out to lunch.  Her failure to support your decision makes her asshole worthy.  I agree with all of your suppositions.  But, even if I didn't ... Mom & Dad call the shots.

You\u2019d be talking an infant on a 2 hour round trip car ride to visit people whose health status is unknown.

They don't like the options and are coming up with all sorts of excuses \"these people you only see once a year want to meet the baby\" why you should change your plans to suit them. Don't do it. \n\nStick to your plan and make a ton of memories at home with your son on his first Christmas. He's too young to remember any of it, so it's up to your and your husband to remember how much fun it was for all of you.", "NTA They aren\u2019t making an effort and then making excuses blaming you for why they aren\u2019t. Then they want YOU to make an effort to see them? Nah. You have a full plate. In this season of life, people need to come to you. Eventually you will be able to return to a giving role, but having a six month old ain\u2019t the time. \n\nOn top of everything - the last place I would want my baby right now is in a larger gathering with a bunch of travelers\u2026\n\nMaybe you can FaceTime them or something. NTA and don\u2019t let them guilt you.", "NTA - A six month old doesn\u2019t need to be exposed to your entire extended family in peak illness season anyway. If one side of the family has been able to make contact and visits happen and friends of your family are able to make it happen too? That tells you all you need to know. Don\u2019t feel bad about it. You might want to check out r/absentgrandparents here at Reddit, if you haven\u2019t already. \n\nEvery baby is different so I can\u2019t guarantee this will work for you but I swore by the baby whisperer method to get my kids to sleep through the night. You should also speak to your paediatrician to find out if you can change your feeding programme/schedule, sometimes that makes a huge difference in their ability to make it closer to 8hrs.", "NTA at all.  I would feel so disconnected from them as well.  And packing up a baby with all the stuff you need?  Just no.", "NTA. enjoy your Christmas without any BS. Make new traditions", "Nta what part of 'we're not traveling' do they not understand?", "NTA\nThey're the kind of people that will kiss the baby with their nasty mouths and get him sick anyway.

Enjoy Xmas without family drama", "NTA", "When's the last time you contacted an extended family member about their kids? How often are you otherwise in touch with extended family? When did you last talk or ask them about their lives?\n\nINFO", "NTA and you never will be for prioritizing your nuclear family, which is now your husband and child(ren possibly).", "You gave them agenda, enough said. If they really want to see the baby you gave them the time", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve pointed out that if they want to see your baby, they can make arrangements to do exactly that. End of discussion.\n\nEnjoy your Christmas with your husband and your son, OP. I hope it\u2019s wonderful.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s totally reasonable to want to stay home on Christmas Day and not travel anywhere with a baby. It can be a lot and at that young you definitely don\u2019t want to risk him catching anything so totally reasonable.\n\nBut for you feeling disconnected\u2026are you generally a family that checks in often? That visits often? Did you check in often when others had kids? I know every family is different but I know if one of my cousins had a baby, I\u2019d be getting most updates from my mom who\u2019d be getting them from my aunt, and I probably wouldn\u2019t be the one initiating a visit. We\u2019re close but in a catch up at family gatherings and like each others instagram posts kind of way. Even my brother\u2019s babies, I waited to be invited over and just messaged my brother to let me know if they needed anything. Space is definitely the norm in my family with a new baby. So I just wonder if maybe your family is trying to give space and not realizing it\u2019s bothering you.", "NTA", "NTA but I think you're looking at this wrong. Here is a one shot easy way for you to catch up with all these family members. Now they'll feel more connected and it will be easier to stay in touch going forward. You can even say that you've missed them and felt abandoned. Honestly, let them know how you feel. \n\nTurning your back because you're disappointed in them is hurting you too.", "NTA", "You're complaining because **extended** family didn't stop down and redirect their whole lives around your pregnancy/birth and newborn? Seriously?\n\nNAH I guess but you're a bit much.  Your idea to stay home for Christmas is fine.  Your mother floated a chance for more socializing, and you can certainly decline.  No problem.\n\nIt's pretty rude to jump on your soapbox with that attitude about what everyone has or hasn't done for you though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your husband's family can make time to contact you and follow your boundaries, your own family should be able to do it as well.

Why must you pack up a 6 month old and take him somewhere else just because your family cannot be bothered to make time to see/call you?

Infants have very small stomachs and are very prone to low blood sugar. They should not be sleeping through the night! They need to eat every two to three hours. That period slowly gets longer as they get older, but they will still generally only sleep for 6 hours at a time. If you're trying to put them down for the night at 6 or 7pm, you're doing yourself a disservice. They are going to wake up reliably around midnight to 1am ready to start the day.

My 6 month old facially recognizes my parents more than my 18 month old niece bc my sister never brings her kids around.", "NAH\n\nI understand wanting to stay home.
