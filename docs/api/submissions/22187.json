You're still healing and these hurt. It's a totally fair thing to ask for. It'll suck if you get the 'you're being so dramatic/you're too sensitive' reaction, which might happen, so be prepared for that, but you're totally okay in asking.", "NTA for feeling that way and not liking the where you were in life at the time those pictures were taken but I think its a little insensitive and unrealistic to expect your family to bury a few years of pictures. You have to remember that those weren't bad times for them like it was for you. I think your best path would be to take pride on them and use them as a way to show how much progress you have made.", "In EU we have the 'right to be forgotten' explained as 'the right to silence on past events in life that are no longer occuring', so I think NTA for wanting to erase those images. However there are other ways such as blurring your face and untagging you to protect your privacy.", "NAH\n\nYour parents love you and want to share the happiness of the memories they had with you. But of course it is quite hard for you to see. I think it would be an AH move to ask them to take down the framed photos, but reasonable to ask them to not post/crop  photos of you then. However, be mindful that more questions might be asked than now if your parents suddenly stop posting photos, or if people see the photos without you. Difficult situation man, and i hope another person in the comments can find a better solution", "YWNBTA - Even if those are good memories for your family those are painful memories for you. I'm transmasc and if I saw my old self pre-transition still in books and photos I would be devastated. They can still keep the photos and just photoshop you out, it's easier than ever to get photos edited. Yes it will be a hassle if they were to get every photo photoshopped they can still crop you out of many photos. Your feelings are valid and you can kindly ask them to take some of the photos down while explaining to them why these pictures cause you pain", "YTA. Like it or not, that\u2019s part of your life story. Not only yours, but your family\u2019s. Instead of being ashamed of where you were, why not be proud of how far you\u2019ve come and where you are now? Your attitude makes it seem like you haven\u2019t truly fully healed. And you\u2019re simply not entitled to their memories or mementos.", "YWBTA. It's important to remember that those pictures are a part of your family's memories and milestones too.", "NTA\n\nThey are shitty parents if they know that it does make you uncomfortable but refuse to do something about it. I get not wanting to take down framed pictures in your own home, but they could at least stop to post pictures you are uncomfortable online again and again.", "YWBTA. I mean this in the kindest way, but go to a counselor/therapist. Hopefully they can help you develop a healthier mindset, and then if you are ever confronted with similar bullshit you can stand up for yourself.", "Would photoshopping the images bring you any peace?", "Gentle YTA. Those picture are happy memories of family together. They loved you in your awkward difficult years and they love now. You are still viewing yourself harshly and unforgivingly but your family don't see you like that. \n\nOn an aside, you don't have to explain yourself if people question your appearance. Just dryly say the teenage years were not kind to you. Most people are awkward insecure about their physical appearance during the teenage years but it is very hard to see because we are so judgemental about ourselves than we are about others.", "YTA Thats probaly good memories for your family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
