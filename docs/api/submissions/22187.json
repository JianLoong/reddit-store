You're still healing and these hurt. It's a totally fair thing to ask for. It'll suck if you get the 'you're being so dramatic/you're too sensitive' reaction, which might happen, so be prepared for that, but you're totally okay in asking.", "NTA for feeling that way and not liking the where you were in life at the time those pictures were taken but I think its a little insensitive and unrealistic to expect your family to bury a few years of pictures. You have to remember that those weren't bad times for them like it was for you. I think your best path would be to take pride on them and use them as a way to show how much progress you have made.", "In EU we have the 'right to be forgotten' explained as 'the right to silence on past events in life that are no longer occuring', so I think NTA for wanting to erase those images. However there are other ways such as blurring your face and untagging you to protect your privacy.", "NAH\n\nYour parents love you and want to share the happiness of the memories they had with you. But of course it is quite hard for you to see. I think it would be an AH move to ask them to take down the framed photos, but reasonable to ask them to not post/crop  photos of you then. However, be mindful that more questions might be asked than now if your parents suddenly stop posting photos, or if people see the photos without you. Difficult situation man, and i hope another person in the comments can find a better solution", "YWNBTA - Even if those are good memories for your family those are painful memories for you. I'm transmasc and if I saw my old self pre-transition still in books and photos I would be devastated. They can still keep the photos and just photoshop you out, it's easier than ever to get photos edited. Yes it will be a hassle if they were to get every photo photoshopped they can still crop you out of many photos. Your feelings are valid and you can kindly ask them to take some of the photos down while explaining to them why these pictures cause you pain", "YTA. Like it or not, that\u2019s part of your life story. Not only yours, but your family\u2019s. Instead of being ashamed of where you were, why not be proud of how far you\u2019ve come and where you are now? Your attitude makes it seem like you haven\u2019t truly fully healed. And you\u2019re simply not entitled to their memories or mementos.", "YWBTA. It's important to remember that those pictures are a part of your family's memories and milestones too.", "NTA\n\nThey are shitty parents if they know that it does make you uncomfortable but refuse to do something about it. I get not wanting to take down framed pictures in your own home, but they could at least stop to post pictures you are uncomfortable online again and again.", "YWBTA. I mean this in the kindest way, but go to a counselor/therapist. Hopefully they can help you develop a healthier mindset, and then if you are ever confronted with similar bullshit you can stand up for yourself.", "Would photoshopping the images bring you any peace?", "Gentle YTA. Those picture are happy memories of family together. They loved you in your awkward difficult years and they love now. You are still viewing yourself harshly and unforgivingly but your family don't see you like that. \n\nOn an aside, you don't have to explain yourself if people question your appearance. Just dryly say the teenage years were not kind to you. Most people are awkward insecure about their physical appearance during the teenage years but it is very hard to see because we are so judgemental about ourselves than we are about others.", "YTA Thats probaly good memories for your family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But seeing pictures of me taken on days I remember feeling suicidal make me feel like I'm going to throw up even 5 years later. I'm not sure how to get over it.", "I haven't thought about it that way but yeah, I probably haven't fully healed yet. I'm proud of my progress but still struggle with embarrassment about how I was before.   \n\n\nFor some reason I feel like if people see pictures of me at that time, that's how they'll always see me and I won't be able to recover their perception of me.", "You\u2019re absolutely wrong here.", "Changing how I look in them would feel wrong because it's not the truth, but cropping or editing me out would.", "You should definitely seek a therapist who has experience with young adults and youth on the spectrum in your area, but what this person has said to you is not accurate, either.", "YWNBTA - I didn\u2019t like my picture taken for pretty much the same amount of time as you haven\u2019t liked it either. I\u2019m in my 40s now but I know it was a long time after I left my teenage years before I was comfortable seeing pictures of me from that time. My daughter is 19 and she\u2019s not let me take her picture for about 5 years now. Breaks my heart as I see her as beautiful and perfect, just as she is but she isn\u2019t comfortable so I\u2019ve never ever pushed it and I\u2019ve told her I understand. It\u2019s nice that you have pictures from that age, you may come to treasure them one day just like your parents do. Please don\u2019t get rid of them completely but asking to be out of site won\u2019t harm anyone.", "You need to get over it because they love you just the same then. To them these are wonderful memories shared with family. I understand you have your own trigger and you feel your own way about it. But they do not feel that way. Just continue to untag yourself and let it go off of your consciousness. Nah", "Slightly different, but I used to be twice the size I am now. I had a medical condition that shut down my metabolism, and my weight ballooned. Once we worked out what the issue was, we got my metabolism restarted and my weight went back down. But there was about a 4-ish year period in between, where I was seriously overweight / obese. \n\nI dislike seeing photos of \u201cfat\u201d me. It makes me feel uncomfortable and sad. So I don\u2019t usually show those photos around. \n\nBut sometimes I do, if I\u2019m chatting to someone who has only known \u201cthin\u201d me, and I mention my previous size issues and they\u2019re curious. \n\nI keep a photo in my files that has me at my top weight alongside a photo of me at my normal / healthy weight (which is half the size of the other).\n\nEvery single person has been incredibly shocked when I show them. They struggle to believe it\u2019s me in the \u201cfat\u201d photo. \n\nBut none of them have thought of me any differently afterwards (apart from being happy for me that I\u2019m now a healthy size), or treated me any differently. It doesn\u2019t change their whole view of me, any more than someone seeing photos of my Dad as a teen with his funny 70\u2019s clothes and giant afro does. It\u2019s just a \u201cWhoa! You were a different person then!\u201d (Which is true.) \n\nI\u2019m telling you this to explain that I very much understand the discomfort of seeing photos of yourself from a difficult period in your life, where you were really struggling. But I also want you to know that when outsiders see those same photos, they\u2019re not necessarily thinking the same things you think, or feeling the same things you feel. And the majority of them aren\u2019t going to have a different view of your current self just because they\u2019ve seen photos of you as an especially awkward teen. \n\n(I say especially awkward because most people have at least some kind of awkward stage. You just happen to be more sensitive about yours because of your extra struggles during that time.)", "NTA. No, just explain that to them, and offer to provide photos you\u2019re comfortable with replacing those photos of you if they want. Explain that while you understand the new photos won\u2019t replace the old ones, and you know they didn\u2019t mean any harm, it makes you really uncomfortable to be reminded of those times when you\u2019ve worked to hard to improve so much, and it\u2019s difficult to put the past fully behind you when you often get reminded of it. It sounds like they aren\u2019t doing it maliciously, so as long as you aren\u2019t aggressive or angry when you explain it, I see no reason they should have an issue with it. In the very least stopping them from posting photos online every year.", "NAH. I think it's a lot to ask that someone never share a photo of a graduation or a wedding because it happened during this age for you. I think it's perfectly understandable why you wouldn't want them to. Make sure all of your settings are updated to not allow tagging, for starters.", "Yes he can ask. And tbh I think they would be assholes if they don't crop him out of pictures they post on fb, bc that's public. But obviously you can't crop people out of pictures in the house so I think they wouldn't be assholes if they refuse that one", "Going through a suicidal period is really traumatic, and I get not wanting to be reminded of that. But someone said you're not fully healed if you get this triggered just from seeing pictures, and I don't disagree with that. That's not your fault though. I do think you should talk to your therapist not just about that, but about how conscious you are of other people's opinions of you based on a reply you made to someone", "Asking them not to tag you is fine. Asking you aren't posted online is fine. Not putting up photos of milestone events .... is something you are probably going to need to compromise on.\n\nCongratulations on getting help and feeling better. NAH", "Soft YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t really expect people to change the contents of their HOME for you. \n\nWhile I totally get where you\u2019re coming from and how you feel these maybe happy memories for your family. \n\nAccepting your past exists, instead of hiding from it, is part of the process.\n\nDon\u2019t ask any questions you\u2019re not prepared to hear the answers to.", "YWNBTA for asking them to remove them, take them dow, or stop posting them, but they have every right to refuse. Have a conversation. It will likely end in a compromise. Maybe they remove some of the photos, maybe you give them new pictures of you to hang up instead. Maybe they take some of the pictures out of the photo book they show guests and put them in a personal photo book just for them. Expecting them to fully bend over backwards is not reasonable, but it sounds like compromise would at least ease the issue a little.", "If OP is still working with a therapist they need to address this. I bet a informal poll would show 99% of adults find their middle school and early high school pictures embarrassing", "Except they\u2019re not happy for him. He was depressed, and even suicidal at times. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not want to be reminded of how much pain you were in then.", "OP, if it may bring you some peace of mind - I've seen old photos of people who used to look very different, but this cannot change my perception of the person in the present. I believe that's the case with most people, never seen anyone who starts to treat another person different just because of such photos.", "NTA. They should love you enough to respect your wishes. Your family should empathize with you on what you've been through in life. \n\nBut, I would also encourage you to look back on those pictures to see how far you've come. You don't have to feel ashamed or embarrassed of those pictures anymore. You're past it, and you're better now.", "NAH. your family loves you and they have a right to post or have family photos. Go easy on yourself op and instead of being ashamed, recognize that we are all very flawed human beings and you worked very hard to grow and evolve into the person you are today. Look at those photos with pride and say \"man, what a tough time that was. But look at me now and everything I've accomplished. I'm proud of myself\" I bet your friends and family are proud of you too and would give you a lot of positive feedback and gas you up."]}
