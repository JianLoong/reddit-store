{"id": 7195, "submission_id": "10adaao", "title": "AITA for not helping a friend who cut me off over a cookie?", "selftext": "About a month ago, this friend of mine (both 20f) invited me for a day out. I've known her for four years and were very close. She asked me to pick her up from her boyfriend's (25m) flat. They've been together for about 4 months. When I came over, a friend of his (J) was also present. As we're leaving, my friend points out to a box of pot cookies lying on the couch, hinting that we'll eat them once we come back. (I'm not aware that they aren't just 'normal' cookies.)\n\nWe went out, had a good day, come back to her boyfriend's in the evening. We have a good time, the four of us, and then later in the night my boyfriend joins in. The cookies were no longer on the couch and i wasn't bothered about them anyway. My friend and her boyfriend go to the bedroom first. My boyfriend leaves. J and I smoke a blunt and go to sleep. \n\nNext morning I wake up early and head home, no one had woken up yet. After a few hours, i receive a text from her, asking me if I had stolen a cookie. I decline. I had no idea about the whereabouts of it and i couldn't care less. She leaves me on read. She texts my boyfriend asking the same and he declines. She talks shit about me to him, saying how 'embarrassed' she is in front of her new boyfriend, without confronting me. She says that they infact were pot cookies and that I knew that they were, and that I only visit her to get high. My boyfriend shuts her off telling her never to talk to me or him again. She says she doesn't give a fuck about us anyway, inspite of us being almost like a family for years. Years of friendship ended in a flash. Over a fucking cookie.\n\nThe same evening, i receive a call from her which I don't pick up at first, but she bombards me with 'i need help ' messages. I reluctantly pick up her call, only for her to 'inform' me that she hasn't told her parents that she's in the same city as theirs and she has told them she's living with me instead. So if either of her parents call me i should 'take up her responsibility and take care of it'. I tell her parents that she's with me every time she visited the city, away from her uni. Those are the only texts or calls i receive from her for weeks, just informing me about stuff and telling me what to do. But yesterday, i had had it enough.\n\nHer dad calls me later that day because he wanted to talk to her about something urgent and she was ignoring his calls. Without any remorse i tell him the truth that she's not with me and that I had nothing to do with her that day. Her dad worriedly hangs up.\n\n i receive multiple texts from her in no time, on \"how dare i break the code\" and just a huge essay on how it was easily the most fucked up thing I did to her, which i didn't bother much to read. I told her that I didn't want her to be my responsibility if she was just going to use me for these favours. She ends the conversation with 'yeah alright, I'm sorry ' and we haven't talked since.\n\nAm i the asshole for not helping her and instead exposing her lies?", "created_utc": 1673563502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10adaao/aita_for_not_helping_a_friend_who_cut_me_off_over/", "score": 355, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Except, the cookies are hers already, I guess, and they have pot in them, and she's an asshole not a mouse?\n\nEh, NTA. And I bet if the mouse had a pot cookie that book would be lit.", "NTA The way she acted about the cookie, you would think that was the worst possible thing you could have done to her. After the way she behaved over a freaking cookie you didn't eat, I wouldn't worry about lying for her.", "I wouldn't call you TAH, but I wouldn't say you are guiltless in this story.  Yes, she is a HUGE jerk for saying crappy things about you and then asking for your help.  When she DID ask for help and you (I am assuming here) didn't want to assist, you should have shut it down right then.  A conversation about her crappy accusations and horrible words against you should have been brought up and you should have told her no...no interest in helping.  However, you did, and that's in the past.  \n\nYeah...you broke the code (whatever), but she is lying to her parents and it's not your responsibility to keep them informed of her whereabouts.", "NTA She want a favor from you? Then she shouldn't accuse you of stealing a fuckng cookie and then insult you to your own bf.", "NTA.\n\nStay away from people that do drugs. Any kind of drugs. Even marijuana.", "NTA\n\n\nCan't break friend code if she's not your friend.  She decided you weren't friends.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is trash.", "> My boyfriend shuts her off telling her never to talk to me or him again.\n\nUhh even in the context of silly 20s drama, this is really big overreaction from your BF. \n\n> She says she doesn't give a fuck about us anyway, inspite of us being almost like a family for years. Years of friendship ended in a flash. Over a fucking cookie.\n\nIt probably would have blown over in a week or two...\n\n> Without any remorse i tell him the truth that she's not with me and that I had nothing to do with her that day. \n\n...Until you did this. \n\nA true ESH. Like, seriously. Everyone here really sucks.", "ESH if you said you would lie for her and then you didn\u2019t. Maybe I missed that in your post but I can\u2019t tell if you agreed to or not just that you always have, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to continue doing it. But if you told her you would that\u2019s mean\n\nBut also, if she had picked up the phone for her dad he wouldn\u2019t have called you in the first place. She should have picked up the phone for her dad since she was already mean to you about a cookie.\n\nBut listen, don\u2019t hang out with petty \u201cfriends\u201d who think that you would steal drugs from them. Nothing good will come out of that and it would be terrible for you to get hurt in anyway over something you had nothing to do with.", "She didn\u2019t even ask either. She insisted and hung up before OP could even say \u201cno\u201d", "Her parents are strict and have academically high hopes from her. If they learn that she skips school to stay with her boyfriend, they'll stop funding her. She used to use me as a cover up because her parents trust me with her. She ended the call before I could reply anything.", "hahah", "NTA. She\u2019s dumb and an AH. That\u2019s what we call \u201cbiting the hand that feeds\u201d", "So there you have your answer. She needed you only as alibi. She is not your friend.", "NTA", "OP=NTA except for agreeing to lie in the first place.\n\nAs far as I can tell at that point, she was only using you as a shield, not being a friend, so what did you lose by telling the truth?", "Nta. You tell her she drew first blood when she talked nasty about you to your boyfriend.", "NTA. Accuses you of taking a cookie. Accuses you that the only reason you hang out with her is to get high... meanwhile, shamelessly asks you to cover for her living with her boyfriend? Who needs who? You can find pot anywhere these days. But good luck finding someone to cover your ass with your parents.", "NTA with friends like that who seriously needs enemies?", "Some people need to cut down on the pot.", "NTA. \nHelping her with what? Lying to her family? For what purpose is she doing that? Guess it depends if it's because they are abusive or she is scamming them for money,  etc", "NTA\n\nYou should have given him her address,  but warned him not to eat their cookies,  because she goes nuclear if one of her pot cookies goes missing.", "Or she just miscounted or she forgot she had one or or or.\n\nSo many ways a cookie can go missing.", "When you spend e ough time wit someone like this your normal meter gets broken and it's hard to know right from wrong.\n\nA lot of reasons this sub exists is for people who have had mind games played so often they've lost all internal compass and need a reality check.", "Been smoking too much weed.\n\nYou are NTA\n\nYour so-called friend is a major a-hole. Time to ditch her.", "NTA\n\nBlock her and move on. If she can use you and turn on you so quickly she\u2019s not your friend", "NTA. Cookie issue aside (which is ridiculous btw), it is concerning that your friend is asking you to cover for her. That\u2019s a dangerous precedent to set. What if you told her parents she was fine and in reality she really wasn\u2019t fine? You did the right thing.", "Nta", "No I don't care anymore, but i did care about her parents. They were always really nice to me whenever i interacted with them and trusted me with her. Telling them the truth that she wasn't with me really concerned them that day. They were heavily worried, especially after hearing this from me- someone they thought their daughter is with. That's why I began second guessing my decision, I could've just lied again. \n\nBut I'm glad I didn't. I don't know what happened between her and her parents after, but she's still posting pictures of her and her boyfriend oh so obviously showing off their stash collection on Instagram stories, so."]}
