Do this.\nCalmly talk to her and explain the situation to her in a way she can see things from YOUR shoes, as in given roles reversed, would she still feel the same way? \n\nHere's an example.\n\nIf she bought concert tickets to see her favorite artist and men were joining her that made you feel uncomfortable, so she bought you a ticket to join.... then day of, you refused to wake up to the point she was almost late.... ask her if she would either go without you OR miss the concert, which she was excited and looking forward to attending for WEEKS and inevtiably waste the money spent for both of the tickets....\n\nIf shes persistent enough to say she would still feel the same way about it, she's full of shit.", "NTA.

I'd say NTA for the purpose that you didn't not wake her up, in fact you tried more than once.

If you have been together for awhile, those boundaries should already be established and you should respect them and her and not have gone or uninvited the other women.\n Though, if this is a first time thought, I'd say you should've talked to her about it before going. When you're in relationships,  you have to consider the other person. What may not be a big deal to you, might be to the other. \nWhile I mention this, no way am I agreeing with what she did as clearly she might very well have expected you to not go because she didn't wake up and that isn't fair to you, especially losing out on money. I'd say, this is a moment for you to think of this woman is what you'd like to continue being with or if this was a cross in the line.", "ESH. You both sound super immature.", "ESH.

That\u2019s all- I\u2019m not saying he should have delayed or skipped the trip, I\u2019m not saying he should have sat next to her and gently nudged her into awakeness with coffee and breakfast in bed- I\u2019m simply asking if he had a coherent conversation with her to help her realize what time it was. \n\nThis mentality that people should never do a thoughtful thing for someone or give them a little grace is so depressing.", "You\u2019re new here, aren\u2019t you?\n\nJudging people off of imagined scenarios is what this sub is known for, lol\n\nNinja edit: I completely agree with you, though", "Even still a note is the polite thing to do if your partner is sleeping.", "I take sleeping meds. My bf has to shake me for me to be able to wake up, since idk if I\u2019m dreaming or awake at that point. The story is very short and OP gives no detail for us to work with.", "I mean, if I try to wake someone up I never fail at waking them up on the first try.  Not once.  It's not hard at all.  Something just don't add up. Call me skeptical if you want, but I think too many people are buying the OPs narrative.", "I mean think about it, if you had a trip planned and you truly wanted someone to go with and they had $200 on it, are you going to whisper in their ear to get up with a nudge?  No.  You'll turn the lights on, shake them awake, and talk, and get them going.  It would take 30 seconds of trying.  \n\nOP has reasons to leave his girlfriend behind, theres motive there.", "Two friends he has had sexual relations with.", "Double Holed Ass", "I wonder if they meant to say DAH", "I'm hung up about someone treating someone else the way they want to be treated? That's an equal power dynamic, the example I suggested", "Well he planned it without her so she can plan without him too right?", "By that rationale, since OP planned the trip, shouldn\u2019t he have been the one to arrange breakfast?", "She should\u2019ve been awake if she wanted to go so she\u2019s the AH for that but why the hell does she need to make food for them?? that\u2019s actually ridiculous. She wasn\u2019t the host, he was. If there\u2019s like 10 people coming you\u2019re saying she needs to make enough drinks and food for all of them like she\u2019s hosting thanksgiving dinner when she doesn\u2019t even know them?? fk that lol", "So even if she never met theses friends before OP still invited her to come along. She knows she doesn\u2019t like fishing, but hey new activity and a chance to hang out at sea. But instead of meeting her BF close friends, she sleeps in. How is OP the villain? I\u2019m seriously not tracking your logic at all.", "You're mad you, if she can't trust him then they shouldn't be together she literally had an opportunity to go but apparently she doesn't know how to set an alarm, she relied on her bf to get her up, which she didn't take seriously. It's her own dam fault.", ">This mentality that people should never do a thoughtful thing for someone or give them a little grace is so depressing.\n\nI agree and you have things backwards.   She knew this outing with his college friends was a big deal to the OP.  She should have made an extra effort to be up and ready to go to meet them.", "He got her up 3 times. Maybe I\u2019m lucky, because even if I only sleep an hour, the alarm goes off I get up.  Plus if I only have someone wake me up when something is planned I jump up because it is strange.  Plus, again it might be just me,  I don\u2019t like hot coffee in the, iced vanilla coffee in the afternoon maybe.  But why would you bring breakfast in bed when you are going to onto a boat.  That is a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nIn the end none of it matters.  She made a big deal about going and was invited.  She doesn\u2019t care enough about him or the situation to get her butt out of bed.  She needs to be responsible for her own actions and lack of them.", "three attempts at waking her across fifteen minutes seems like a solid effort. \n\nPolite would have been her getting up on time to go to the trip he payed for her to join him on.", "So what do you do when you have something planned for early the next day?", "I'm sure in most of those cases you are referring to the person you are trying to wake up probably isn't trying to sabotage a trip you wanted to go on.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust sayin' from the start the gf doesn't seem to want OP to go and falling back asleep 3 times while being woken up doesn't support that she made any sort of effort to get up and ready.", "I did think about it.  GF didn't want OP to go originally.  OP offered to bring her along to placate insecurities... \n\nGF decided not to get up on time. \n\nNot once\n\nNot twice \n\nBut three times.  \n\nIf anyone has reasons for anything it's the GF.", "Yea\u2026 the motive of his Gf trying to force him to not go on the trip maybe \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "And?", "_YWBTDHA._", "Even funnier!  The guilty have sh*t coming out of both.", "He invited his girlfriend along on the trip when she protested. He heard her concerns and addressed them appropriately. Her failure to wake up and follow through on the plans she insisted he make is on her, not anyone else.\n\nI swear, reading comprehension is dead", "Lmao what\u2019re you trying to do? OP\u2019s girlfriend is very clearly the asshole.", "Sure. As long as she\u2019s also out the $200.00 and allows him to try and sabotage the trip. As long as she\u2019s cool with that.", "His group planned the trip.   I just think that a little extra on her part, not a full breakfast but maybe a basket of breakfast snacks/donuts, would have been a nice way to say \"I'm glad you came so far to be with OP\".   I guess my perspective is that if you want to be with someone, you want his friends to want to be with you too.", "No, of course not.   I was thinking more like coffee and a basket of breakfast snacks.  IOW, nothing fancy, just a welcoming attitude.   \n\nBut then I'm not 20 and have different expectations.", "I ask him to wake me up. We live together. Is more of recent problem, so I\u2019m working on it. \n\nIn grad school me and my friends were all so tired all the time, so if we had something important really early we would text to call each other at certain times to check. Is nice to have someone to count on.", "Let's just think about the slight possibility op didn't want her to come along anyway so he could have time with his other girls.", "Right? \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f imagine reading this and thinking the BF was the one with motives \ud83e\udd23 soon as she wanted to come he was like \u201csure I\u2019ll pay\u201d but he totally just wanted to bang that other girl \ud83e\udd14and it\u2019s HIS fault she went back to sleep three times", "I don't think someone who wants to sabotage a trip buys a $200 ticket.  Wtf.", "Lol his post said that he planned the trip?? \n\nI don\u2019t think breakfast is a bad idea, I just dont think the onus should be solely on her to provide it. At the very least it should be a joint effort.", "But  she can be welcoming without catering. He\u2019s definitely not the ass in the situation  but she doesn\u2019t have to go that far for his friends, y\u2019know? Even coffee for a bunch of people could be two pots or more, depending on how many people and how much they drink. Plus it\u2019s not like they were having an event at their house, and it\u2019s likely they either brought food or went to go get some as a group.", "That MIGHT make sense if OP didn't shell out $200 for her spot on the fishing trip... or if he DIDN'T invite her along... OR if he left without attempting to wake her at all.  \n\nShe made the choice not to get up and she missed out on the trip.  \n\nOP didn't try to hide the trip or exclude her from it so it seems like quite a grasp to assume he is out trying to screw around.", "I'm just not buying it, again, I've never struggled with waking someone up.  Even if they're sluggish.  Nobody here is remembering there's two sides to every story.  I wouldn't leave my woman in this scenario.  I'd wake her ass up.  Am I the only one that's never struggled getting someone out of bed?  I have kids for ffs.  Think they're late to school cause I don't care if they keep sleeping?  Get real. Waking someone up isn't hard.  You can say you tried 3 times, but I ain't buying it.", "Who paid for the ticket\u2026. Try reading again mate?\u2026 so you AGREE the bf had no reason to waste HIS 200$?\u2026.. \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "All that's true.  I was just pointing out the difference between being happy to meet with his college buddies and trying to sabotage the plan.", "Then you\u2019ve never had a lazy GF?\u2026. I\u2019ll literally carry my Gf out of bed and find her back In bed 5 minutes later?\u2026.\nThe fact you completely disregard the story given. In favour of creating your own version that favours the GF doesn\u2019t really make you credible. It just makes you a white knight \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAbsolutely ppl exist who could have someone screaming in their ear and still to back to sleep. Especially if that person is doing so to be manipulative to get their way?\u2026. Not really uncommon\u2026. Like. At all? \ud83e\udd14"]}
