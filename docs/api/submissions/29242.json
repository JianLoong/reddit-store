If you have been together for awhile, those boundaries should already be established and you should respect them and her and not have gone or uninvited the other women.\n Though, if this is a first time thought, I'd say you should've talked to her about it before going. When you're in relationships,  you have to consider the other person. What may not be a big deal to you, might be to the other. \nWhile I mention this, no way am I agreeing with what she did as clearly she might very well have expected you to not go because she didn't wake up and that isn't fair to you, especially losing out on money.

In this situation, I\u2019d be pretty hurt if I was her too. You purposely went and planned something you knew she\u2019d be uncomfortable with. That\u2019s kind of a dick move.

I find it interesting that not one girl but  two girls who you \u201chad a thing\u201d with had scheduled a fishing trip with you.  That\u2019s an interesting dynamic.   It speaks to the casualness of your relationships.  You didn\u2019t think it was necessary to check with your girlfriend to see if she was comfortable with it.  If she wasn\u2019t comfortable, would you have gone?  Do you think your girlfriend is weird for feeling uncomfortable with it?  Do you have any understanding of why she might feel the way she did?  Do you actually think inviting your current girlfriend to a fishing trip with the \u201ctwo women\u201d  you had  a thing with was a good solution?  I personally don\u2019t think inviting her showed any sensitivity on your part.  Going on your fishing expedition was first\u2026 not the girlfriend.  Your girlfriend could have been plainer with you.  She agreeing to going on a fishing trip that she wouldn\u2019t enjoy was her mistake.  Her actions were passive aggressive.  She needed to be angry with herself for agreeing to it to begin with.  I don\u2019t call it abandonment.  But I do think your actions were selfish and maybe you\u2019re not ready for a serious relationship yet.  You\u2019re 21 years old.

How awkward for your gf. You don't have any male buddies that you didn't have a \"thing\" with to fish with. You clearly knew she was upset and uncomfortable.

Abandoning her would have been the night before you aren\u2019t home, you don\u2019t sleep at home that night, you come get your car and pack a bag without telling her or making her aware, and then the next day you avoid all contact while still going fishing, don\u2019t come home again that night and just show up and act like everything is normal. That would be abandonment. You not answering after waking her up 3 times and being upset about that is absolute deflection and her latching in to something that she could get mad about because she chose not to be a responsible adult and get up when you woke her up 3 times. That is 3 more times then I would have. You coming then we agree on a time to set the alarm. You don\u2019t wake up with me and stay in bed I\u2019m going to assume you decided to stay home and are not awake enough to communicate your decision. \n\nThe only thing I can say is I would have woken her up until she verbally says \u201cI\u2019m not getting up, or go without me, or I\u2019m staying in bed to sleep more\u201d that way there is nothing on you at all", "NTA. \nshe just wants something to moan about. \nShe also needs to grow up", "NTA. you tried, and her not waking up is not an excuse to be late to meet out-of-town friends", "I don't think this relationship is going to last long with a jealous GF.

I always told my wife, I'ld wake her once and if she goes back to sleep,  I don't care if she's late, she would get fired or whatever. Waking your GF up three times is just  too much.

She knew the plans ahead of time, and you gave her more than enough chances to be able to come along with you. Did you leave her a note explaining you tried to wake her up before you left?

Why wouldn\u2019t you want her to come in the first place, u say she got jealous and u told her she could come then, why wouldn\u2019t she be jealous? You admit u had a think with them.

I wouldn\u2019t just leave my significant other to go do a plan we made ESPECIALLY if I paid for it, I\u2019d make them get up. She probably feels like you didn\u2019t want her to come.

You are not her father, it's not your job to make sure this grown adult gets up in time. She chose not to come by refusing to get out of bed. \n\nHow much you want to bet that she was awake and was just refusing to get up?

You could\u2019ve just been a jerk and made her get up since she wanted to go sooo badly and actually put that money to use because trust me she would\u2019ve been less mad over that and you wouldn\u2019t be questioning whether or not you\u2019re TA. Watching people begrudgingly commit to things they agreed to brings great catharsis so I highly recommend making her suffer through her own commitments instead of wasting money on her insecurities.", "a lot of comments trying to make the gf seem like a manipulator, but for all I know, this could have just been her not getting enough sleep or having a difficult morning... it happens, shocking. does she have a history of pulling this shit?  \n\n\nanyways, NTA. both my sister and my mom have actually brought up that it's not cool to hang out with an ex without the current gf, and she could have been raised with the same thing thing in mind, but if you tried multiple times, not much you could have done.

Even a \u201cfriend of a friend\u201d. I think it\u2019s your job to not be at any event where past partners will be, if you have to go, you better drag your GF out of bed to come with you. I don\u2019t think leaving her behind when she wouldn\u2019t wake up is a problem, I think YTA because you\u2019re still hanging out with past flings. Now this is conjecture, but I\u2019d bet your gf didn\u2019t wanna go or was dreading going because of these girls and that may have played a factor in her \u201cnot waking up\u201d\n\nEdit: to get ahead of anyone, I understand everyone\u2019s relationship works differently and they might not share my opinion. However, the point of asking a question like this on Reddit is to get other peoples opinions. So maybe your relationship works differently but this is how my partner and I see things and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re not completely alone in that. Both of us had friends we\u2019ve known since high school who we cut off because the relationship with the friend turned sexual. When you\u2019re single, it\u2019s fine to have that relationship and have that \u201copen door\u201d but once the relationship turns sexual and you can have sexual relations with said friend, even if it was just once, they are now a FWB and it is wrong to be in that kind of relationship once you have a partner. \n\nIn my situation, I have a past fling who is now dating one of my best friends. When I started dating my GF, I removed this woman from all my socials as to close the door on any private communications. We do run into each other, but only when her boyfriend and my girlfriend are at the gathering as well. There are some past partners who you can\u2019t simply \u201ccut off\u201d but if you\u2019re seeing your past partners WITHOUT your girlfriend present, I would assume this is pissing her off and she doesn\u2019t know how to tell you that", "NTA.  She missed out because she chose to go back to sleep.  On a side note, I have a friend who is 44 who's mommy still calls to wake him up every day.

These friends are also traveling to see OP, so they probably don\u2019t see each other in person often. Therefore, this fishing trip is likely precious to this friend group.

Close friendship means one-on-one hangouts, a significant amount of communication, emotional closeness.  To me it is a bad sign.  A post relationship friendship often involves left over romantic/sexual feelings.  The most common person someone cheats with is \u201ca friend\u201d.  So it is simply way more likely to happen when that \u201cfriend\u201d is someone you used to fuck and have a sexual/romantic relationship with.  I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of people who are friends with exes and have never cheated on their SO.  But the risk is simply much higher, and it\u2019s not one I think is worth taking.  It is also a sign that can\u2019t move on from the relationship or the hook-up.  I know a significant amount of people think differently, and that\u2019s fine.
