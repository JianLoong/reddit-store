This is something you knew from the start so it's not like he's just all of a sudden bringing it up to be controlling.

You shouldn't have to worry about your partner finding you less attractive just bc you have multiple tattoos. If you are getting small ones as you said, they can be hidden so he can't see them. To me tattoos are art work and while I only have 3 and plan to get more, I myself am not attracted to someone who is covered with them (head, face, neck, hands, knuckles).\n\n I think you should have a serious conversation with him and ask if you getting more is a deal breaker for him.

It does NOT mean that he cannot love her and still not like her tattoos, or anything even remotely close to that.", "> He said I knew his stance on tattoos from the beginning, and asked me how I could expect him to be okay with it now. \n\nIf the fact that he makes her feel like he needs to be okay with what she decides to do with her body doesn't at least strongly hint at objectification, I don't know.", "They are attractive.", "People can have preferences, he is allowed that.", "Strong disagree here. My husband of 25 years is free to get a tattoo at any point if he wants one but it would end our relationship if he did. I loathe them. OP is NTA but she shouldn't be surprised if her relationship ends.", "But that's just the thing he didn't tell her this after she started doing this. He told her from the beginning.. listen I'm just not attracted to people that have tattoos. Everyone has the right to what they are attracted and are not attracted to. And if you want to take that away from somebody that makes YOU controlling. It's not any different than if you meet somebody and they say listen I'm just the kind of person who's not attracted to heavy set people. And then you get mad at them because they don't want to date somebody who's 600 lb. Well they're not physically attracted to you so how are you going to get mad that they're not attracted to you. We all have our preferences and he has every right to have his own preference.", "If my girl shaved off all her hair or put on 50lbs or got a face tattoo I would no longer be attracted to her and leave. I don\u2019t understand people wanting to intentionally make the person they love not attracted to them. If there\u2019s something I can do to make my so more attracted to me I\u2019m probably going to do it.", "I wonder if she really needs to ask him or if she's just choosing to ask him? If she's choosing then that's completely on her and has nothing to do with him without her actually answering the question we can't judge on that", "If you love and respect your partner, you shouldn't make them feel like shit about something they want to do to their body, especially something this trivial that impacts you in absolutely no way. \n\nOP's partner is certainly doing the very same thing you accuse OP of doing.", "\u201cIf you stop loving someone because they murdered a child you never loved them in the first place\u201d do you see how ridiculous you sound?

Oh wait, no, he never said that. Stop making assumptions, him not loving her anymore is a fear that OP has, not a fact stated by OP's boyfriend. OP's boyfriend is afraid his physical attraction to her might fade, but attraction is led by whats on the inside as well.", "It's called a bodily preference. If that's objectification then I'm sorry to say but most of us objectify.", "I said I can relate to OP's partner. Attraction is very important (to me) in a relationship, and tons of tattoos aren't attractive. We all have certain boundaries and for some people, too many tats are one of them.  OP knew this from the get go, and is shocked her partner isn't pleased that she' now entertaining a 3rd tattoo.  If the tattoos are more important than the relationship, then I think the relationship is dead.", "Dude, just accept that you misunderstood my comment and move on. It\u2019s not my fault that you failed to understand simple English, and getting angry and aggressive with me because I explained it to you is very immature, especially since you started your first rude comment with \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.\u201d It did make sense, you just failed to understand it, and now you\u2019re being hostile and unpleasant because you can\u2019t handle being corrected when you make a mistake.", "It's not that, it's talking about it like your preference is as important or more important than another person's self expression or the idea that you owe anyone to stay within some narrow window of their preference.\n\nObviously don't date tattooed chicks if you don't like tatoos and that is absolutely, 100% fine. Asking your partner not to get one is a different matter, and saying things like \"how could you think I would be okay with this\" sounds just a tad bit entitled.", "So if you want a beard, and your partner hates beards, you\u2019d shave right? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nShe\u2019s a person who likes tattoos. That\u2019s who she is. If his love and attraction for her stops when she gets tattoos, then he doesn\u2019t really love her. She has every right to be herself, it does not mean she doesn\u2019t love him. Pretending she doesn\u2019t want any more tattoos to appease her bf is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve heard today. You\u2019re saying if she loves him she would deny herself the things she wants because what he wants should be more important to her. That\u2019s not healthy. That\u2019s how people end up in abusive relationships! \n\nI hate beards. My husband loves his. I don\u2019t say a damn thing because it\u2019s his body. He\u2019s a lot hotter without the big beard, but I love the man, his kindness, his sense of humor etc. That\u2019s what I\u2019m attracted to, him. You aren\u2019t going to love everything about someone. Ever. People have flaws. If tattoos make you leave, you\u2019re shallow. Your not in love, you just want something you find attractive to f*ck.\n\nHere\u2019s some advice for you, if the most important thing is how your partner looks, you can order life sized dolls online. That way you don\u2019t have to worry about your partner changing their body to make it \u201cunattractive\u201d to you. \n\nPS: tattoos are attractive. Lots of men love my tats. I get compliments on the daily.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry but you two are not compatible. As much as you like this relationship you need to find someone who won\u2019t get into a fight with you about getting tattoos. Even when you win the arguments chances are there is resentment on his side. It\u2019s your canvas not his. Don\u2019t expect him to change his mind. There won\u2019t be one tattoo that will make him go \u201chuh this isn\u2019t worth fighting over and it makes OP happy\u201d. This is something he feels strongly about and you can\u2019t change that about him. Change is something that he would want but clearly he doesn\u2019t want to change his views. It\u2019s not fair to either of you. \n\nFunny enough I use to not like tattoos myself but as I got older I didn\u2019t mind them and find some of them to be really interesting or cool. I like seeing them on people but I won\u2019t get them myself - too low pain tolerance and seeing them on aged skin kind of wrecked that. This change occurred on its own going through life and not because of a partner, friend or family member\u2019s influence/having tattoos.", "NAH, I mean dude you just need to accept the reality, you two are not compatible and you're only seeing a future because you want there to be a future. But that fantasy does not line up with reality.\n\nThis person is not your only option. You won't die alone if you don't stay with this person. There is someone out there who will like your tattoos and that won't be a reason for them to question the future of the relationship.

He's been pretty clear about his feelings. You may feel it's small but from the outside this seems like an actual deal breaker. You need to find out specifically if the idea that he won't find you beautiful is in your head or his actual real thoughts. I think that would pretty much set your course forward.", "NTA. My ex hated tattoos on women. He saw them the same way as scars and therefore unattractive. I had one tattoo from before we got together.

ESPECIALLY when you're only dating.\n\nI didn't say she had to \"pretend she doesn't want anymore tattoos\" so don't put words in my mouth.  She can tell him she likes them, and I'm sure she already has.

I flat out told him when he asked me out \"No thanks, I hate beards, but best of luck to you.\" He immediately offered to shave his beard and he did to go out with me.

I certainly don't want to live by yours.\n\nPS: Whether or not tattoos are attractive is a matter of opinion based on an individual. I find nothing appealing about them.  Not on me, not on 99.9% of others I see.  I've only ever seen 2 tattoos that I thought were nice looking and a boon to the person who had them.  Generally I think they're trashy and unattractive.", "> So if you want a beard, and your partner hates beards, you\u2019d shave right? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nNot the person you're responding to, but I agree with him, and yes.

And yes I do have some very strong negative feelings about facial hair and excessive tattoos.  I really don't even like the one tattoo my husband has, and he wants to cover it up with a better one, and while I'm okay with that, I tend to look away from that area of his body because I don't find that to be attractive.  I've been open about these turn offs since before our first date, and he still wanted to be with me and marry me. We all have little quirks to our preferences, and I'm very glad my husband accommodates me on the facial hair thing.  I didn't ask him to shave it, he offered to. I was perfectly content to never date him and let him lead his life as a bearded man, but not at my side as one.  He was attracted to me strongly enough that he made sure we could date. \n\nHe has certain preferences too, that I go along with.  But I'll never get a tattoo, even though I know he'd like it.  He asked me once and I said \"that's like putting a bumper sticker on a Ferrari.\"  He accepts my aversion to these things while loving me anyways.  \n\nNot everyone has to feel the exact same way on these matters.  I accept that others don't agree with me.  But they won't change me either."]}
