{"id": 1884, "submission_id": "yqfxkm", "title": "AITA for getting tattoos when my bf hates them?", "selftext": "Ever since the beginning of our relationship, I was aware of his feelings towards tattoos. I wanted to get a small one, and it was a whole thing. Ultimately, he accepted it because, at the time, I wanted it to only be one. But I started noticing I wanted to have another. And I genuinely believed, again, that I wouldn't want to have more. So he begrudgingly accepted it once again. \n\nMaybe I was naive to think that. Because now I have a whole list of ideas. And I've been wanting to get another small one. So I told him about it, and it didn't go over so well. He said I knew his stance on tattoos from the beginning, and asked me how I could expect him to be okay with it now. I honestly thought that it wouldn't matter as much, especially since we've been together for a couple of years now. \n\nI feel really hurt. I see a future where, every time I want to get another tattoo, I'll have to be afraid that he will not think I'm beautiful anymore. He thinks that I'll ruin my body with tattoos and that he won't like the way I look anymore. I get that he's not attracted to women with tattoos. But it's not like it's my style to cover everything. I'm more drawn to smaller tattoos. But perhaps that's naive of me to think that won't change either. \n\nIn my opinion, this shouldn't be such a big issue. But it is, and maybe it's unfair of me to expect him to be ok with something he didn't like from the start. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nUPDATE: First of all, thank you for your replies! I noticed a trend of comments saying that my bf and I are incompatible and should break up. I get where you're coming from, but I don't agree. We had another conversation in the meantime, and we were able to be much more open to each other about what we feel and what we want from each other. We realized we were both being quite stubborn in our prior convo. So this time around it went much better. \n\nI asked him what he needs from me to meet him in the middle. And he said he would like me to show him different versions or options of the tattoo that I like, so he can decide with me. Alongside that, he likes to be able to talk about placement as well. So we talked about the specific tattoo I want right now, and he feels much better now that he has been involved. I also feel so much better, because I feel like we're more on the same page now. \n\nI know this might not be the solution everyone agrees with, but it feels like it's a good solution for us and our relationship. So again, thank you all so much for your insights! It did help me take a look at myself and my own expectations as well, and meeting him in the middle moreso than expecting him to just accept everything for me.", "created_utc": 1667992523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqfxkm/aita_for_getting_tattoos_when_my_bf_hates_them/", "score": 263, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But be prepared for him to no longer be interested in the relationship because he is not attracted to females that have tattoos. This is something you knew from the start so it's not like he's just all of a sudden bringing it up to be controlling.

You shouldn't have to ask for permission to get a tattoo. While I can understand tattoos are not something everyone likes, it shouldn't change how he sees and feels about you if he really loves you. You shouldn't have to worry about your partner finding you less attractive just bc you have multiple tattoos. If you are getting small ones as you said, they can be hidden so he can't see them. To me tattoos are art work and while I only have 3 and plan to get more, I myself am not attracted to someone who is covered with them (head, face, neck, hands, knuckles).\n\n I think you should have a serious conversation with him and ask if you getting more is a deal breaker for him.

Tattoos range for tiny hearts or butterflies in hidden places to abstract colors and pattern sleeves on your shoulders and arms that are hard to hide, to elaborate pictorial scenes of people or things all over your torso, to the real unignorable appearance-changing grotesqueries to the face. Some tattoos carry aggressive messages intended to offend or arouse the viewer; some tattoos are intended to signify dangerousness. Some tattoos commemorate relationships with specfic people.that may seem eternal to a 20 yr old, but not so much by 30 or 40. Some tattoos change employment prospects. Tattoos can be artistically impressive or crudely done, signifying something about the class and tastes of the wearer. To some people a large tattoo may imply a limited ability of the wearer to understand how it affects how people perceive them.  It is common that as the years go by, a person may change feelings about their tattoos. Tattoo removal or camouflage is expensive. \n\nTo many people aware that tastes can change with time, and to many educated people, tattoos signify below average social aspirations, lower class aesthetic values and associations, below average educational ambition, limited ability to understand negative social signals inferred when people see tattoos. Stereotypes are statistical and can be inaccurate or unfair, but for many social interactions, like job interviews, or decisions at a party, people can make decisions based on your appearance that affect you without you even understanding it happened. \n\n Many people would draw lines somewhere among all those possibilities.

My girlfriend and I have been together off and on for 10 years. When we met I did not see any tattoos on her but the first time we got naked I saw her \"tramp stamp\". At that point we had a conversation and I shared my feelings about them. I chose to accept her with that one because I had already developed feelings for her and from our conversation she had got that one to spite her ex husband when they divorced because he had always prohibited her from getting one. So be it. Time goes by and she decides she wants to get another one at which point she comes to ask me for permission.  My reply was to tell her \" you don't have to ask me for permission. I am no one to tell you what you can or can not do with your body. If you want to get one go right ahead, just let me know when you're going so I can pack my shit and go\". She ended up not getting one at that time. At one point we separated for awhile and during that time she went and got another one on her foot. When we got back together she told me and asked me what I thought about it. I told her, \" I don't think anything about it because I haven't seen it and I don't want to, out of sight, out of mind\". That is how I chose to deal with it. Years later I still don't really know what it looks like and she hasn't gotten another one. All that being said, I chose not to see them and she chose not to get more. We decided we were more important to each other, more so than than my dislike of tattoos or her like of them. We were able to make it work for each other but there will always be that boundary to be crossed and its ensuing consequences. Good luck figuring out your dilemma.", "Read the post and saw the edit.

The BF having to \u201cfeel involved\u201d and having input on placement or version of the tattoo is\u2026\u2026.. very strange to me.

You do you, OP.", "This a flat braindead take. People are allowed to have whatever visual preferences they want, and it's kinda sad the feeling of projection I get from your comment where youre basically attacking BF (whom you know literally nothing about) over his personal preference.
