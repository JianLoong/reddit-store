But be prepared for him to no longer be interested in the relationship because he is not attracted to females that have tattoos. This is something you knew from the start so it's not like he's just all of a sudden bringing it up to be controlling.

You shouldn't have to ask for permission to get a tattoo. While I can understand tattoos are not something everyone likes, it shouldn't change how he sees and feels about you if he really loves you. You shouldn't have to worry about your partner finding you less attractive just bc you have multiple tattoos. If you are getting small ones as you said, they can be hidden so he can't see them. To me tattoos are art work and while I only have 3 and plan to get more, I myself am not attracted to someone who is covered with them (head, face, neck, hands, knuckles).\n\n I think you should have a serious conversation with him and ask if you getting more is a deal breaker for him.

I said that if he doesn\u2019t love her with tattoos, he doesn\u2019t love her without them, either. That means, since apparently you need to have it explained to you, that if her having tattoos makes him stop loving her, he never really loved her in the first place. It does NOT mean that he cannot love her and still not like her tattoos, or anything even remotely close to that.", "> He said I knew his stance on tattoos from the beginning, and asked me how I could expect him to be okay with it now. \n\nIf the fact that he makes her feel like he needs to be okay with what she decides to do with her body doesn't at least strongly hint at objectification, I don't know.", "They are attractive.", "People can have preferences, he is allowed that.", "Strong disagree here. My husband of 25 years is free to get a tattoo at any point if he wants one but it would end our relationship if he did. I loathe them. OP is NTA but she shouldn't be surprised if her relationship ends.", "But that's just the thing he didn't tell her this after she started doing this. He told her from the beginning.. listen I'm just not attracted to people that have tattoos. Everyone has the right to what they are attracted and are not attracted to. And if you want to take that away from somebody that makes YOU controlling. It's not any different than if you meet somebody and they say listen I'm just the kind of person who's not attracted to heavy set people. And then you get mad at them because they don't want to date somebody who's 600 lb. Well they're not physically attracted to you so how are you going to get mad that they're not attracted to you. We all have our preferences and he has every right to have his own preference.", "If my girl shaved off all her hair or put on 50lbs or got a face tattoo I would no longer be attracted to her and leave. I don\u2019t understand people wanting to intentionally make the person they love not attracted to them. If there\u2019s something I can do to make my so more attracted to me I\u2019m probably going to do it.", "I wonder if she really needs to ask him or if she's just choosing to ask him? If she's choosing then that's completely on her and has nothing to do with him without her actually answering the question we can't judge on that", "If you love and respect your partner, you shouldn't make them feel like shit about something they want to do to their body, especially something this trivial that impacts you in absolutely no way. \n\nOP's partner is certainly doing the very same thing you accuse OP of doing.", "\u201cIf you stop loving someone because they murdered a child you never loved them in the first place\u201d do you see how ridiculous you sound? Everything in life is conditional, you don\u2019t deserve love it\u2019s something you have to continually earn unless you\u2019re a puppy.", "What you can explain to me instead is where in the post OP mentions that her bf said that he doesn't love her anymore. Oh wait, no, he never said that. Stop making assumptions, him not loving her anymore is a fear that OP has, not a fact stated by OP's boyfriend. OP's boyfriend is afraid his physical attraction to her might fade, but attraction is led by whats on the inside as well.", "It's called a bodily preference. If that's objectification then I'm sorry to say but most of us objectify.", "I said I can relate to OP's partner. Attraction is very important (to me) in a relationship, and tons of tattoos aren't attractive. We all have certain boundaries and for some people, too many tats are one of them.  OP knew this from the get go, and is shocked her partner isn't pleased that she' now entertaining a 3rd tattoo.  If the tattoos are more important than the relationship, then I think the relationship is dead.", "Dude, just accept that you misunderstood my comment and move on. It\u2019s not my fault that you failed to understand simple English, and getting angry and aggressive with me because I explained it to you is very immature, especially since you started your first rude comment with \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.\u201d It did make sense, you just failed to understand it, and now you\u2019re being hostile and unpleasant because you can\u2019t handle being corrected when you make a mistake.", "It's not that, it's talking about it like your preference is as important or more important than another person's self expression or the idea that you owe anyone to stay within some narrow window of their preference.\n\nObviously don't date tattooed chicks if you don't like tatoos and that is absolutely, 100% fine. Asking your partner not to get one is a different matter, and saying things like \"how could you think I would be okay with this\" sounds just a tad bit entitled.", "So if you want a beard, and your partner hates beards, you\u2019d shave right? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nShe\u2019s a person who likes tattoos. That\u2019s who she is. If his love and attraction for her stops when she gets tattoos, then he doesn\u2019t really love her. She has every right to be herself, it does not mean she doesn\u2019t love him. Pretending she doesn\u2019t want any more tattoos to appease her bf is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve heard today. You\u2019re saying if she loves him she would deny herself the things she wants because what he wants should be more important to her. That\u2019s not healthy. That\u2019s how people end up in abusive relationships! \n\nI hate beards. My husband loves his. I don\u2019t say a damn thing because it\u2019s his body. He\u2019s a lot hotter without the big beard, but I love the man, his kindness, his sense of humor etc. That\u2019s what I\u2019m attracted to, him. You aren\u2019t going to love everything about someone. Ever. People have flaws. If tattoos make you leave, you\u2019re shallow. Your not in love, you just want something you find attractive to f*ck.\n\nHere\u2019s some advice for you, if the most important thing is how your partner looks, you can order life sized dolls online. That way you don\u2019t have to worry about your partner changing their body to make it \u201cunattractive\u201d to you. \n\nPS: tattoos are attractive. Lots of men love my tats. I get compliments on the daily."]}
