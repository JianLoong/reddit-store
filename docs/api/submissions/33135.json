Things are not that friendly between them. I'm not sure of the why, just that they prefer to stay apart and I have always been okay with that. It's my normal and I never expected them to act all friendly with each other. My dad is remarried and has a big blended family at his house. His wife brought three kids into the marriage, dad brought me, they had three more kids together, they took in his wife's two niece's as well. I'm not really close to my dad so I'm not really close to any of his other kids. I spend only one weekend a month with him now, which was my choice and the courts supported when I was 14.\n\nOne thing that probably doesn't need to be explained in a lot of detail but I will mention is they don't really have a lot, my dad's household. Neither he or his wife have great jobs, no child support is paid and things are always tight there. When I was younger and was there every other week it was pretty crappy. Everyone is crammed into the three bedrooms they have. Meals were always kinda crappy and not exactly filling most of the time. Christmas and Birthdays were very modest as well.\n\nMy mom never remarried and focused on providing for stability. I never went without with her and she always did her best to provide me with nice things, both stuff I needed and stuff I wanted. My quality of life was better with her and I was happier with her. It helped that my mom showed me that she cared and that I was a priority. I never really felt that way about my dad but especially when he remarried and his finances took a bigger hit, it always felt like he was bitter and resentful that I was so much better provided for at moms.\n\nThe other kids at dad's house were aware that I had it way better with my mom. They resent me for it. Some of them hate me and think I should have been forced to not see my mom so we'd all have the same.\n\nThis year dad told me that I should have more of an understanding and compassion for \"all my siblings\" and I should talk to mom about helping me pay for gifts for them. He said I might not be able to afford much but mom should be making sure the other kids get something nice from me and showing me how to be a good older brother to all of them. He also mentioned household gifts to make life a little easier. He told me to ask. I made it clear to him that I will not asking mom to spend money on his household. Dad's response was I am totally old enough to put more care into my family and want to see them all have a better Christmas. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702739421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jt6se/aita_for_making_it_very_clear_to_my_dad_that_i_am/", "score": 627, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Expecting you to provide household goods and for your mom to supplement for \"nicer\" gifts is ridiculous.  It is safe to say that you should expect little to nothing for Christmas and it will be \"all your fault\"", "NTA, stop being so soft, your dad is an AH, tell him to stop bitching or you'll just go to your mom and he'll never see you again.\n\nHe'll either be glad that you're leaving and won't make his life harder, or he'll actually change and be normal", "NTA. Children owe their parents several things (love, patience, respect), unless they've been bad parents. And if you borrowed money from your dad you would owe him that; but if not, then no. He's in a special world if he expects other adults outside his marriage to provide for his household. So at this point, maybe you no longer owe him even respect.", "NTA I imagine your dad and his wife had a good reason for taking on her nieces when they were already stretched thin but it is not your responsibility to provide for everyone. Your job right now is to focus on school and enjoy being young. Let the parents be parents.", "NTA.\nDoes he not get that it was your choice to move in with your mother at age 14 because of a cramped life style?\n\nThey had 5 kids before, did they not realise that it wouldn't improve the finance and they did the irresponsible thing to add on further 3 kids. \n\nYour mother is not related to them, why should she spend on the family of an estranged spouse with whom she doesn't get along with.\n\nAnd why should you burden your mother when you don't have a close relationship and don't get along well. And some of them hate you. They should hold their parents accountable to be parents to 8 kids. How in the world did they think they could afford it? Some of them are, I am pretty sure old enough to understand that it is their fault.\n\nAnd your father is a mess to even go as far to manipulate and gaslight you into even questioning yourself.\n\nDon't have kids if you cannot afford to give them a good lifestyle and then expect to mooch it off someone.\n\nETA- I missed it but as some people have pointed out, he will want you to give your money to him to help his family out.\nAdditionally I think he wants you to get a job because he literally said that you are old enough to give them a better Christmas.\n\nWay to be father of the year by raising your child to perform labour for you. I really hate such parents.", "nta. he decided to have three kids on top of you and his three stepkids despite not being able to afford them. why would that be your or your mother's responsibility to fix?", "How in the world did they get custody of the nieces when they were already squeezing 8 people into a 3 bedroom house?", "> they took in his wife's two niece's as well\n\nThere must have been a serious reason for that. I must admit that's the one thing that makes me respect dad and step mom a little. \n\nAs for the rest, no you are not responsible for the finances of your dad's household and asking your mom to pay for it isn't right either. NTA for refusing to beg on your dad's behalf.", "NTA \n\nHe is also old enough to put more care into his family and want to see them all have a better Christmas. And yet- he chose to bring 3 MORE kids into their blended family of 4 kids. Believe me things would have already been tight with the 4 kids but to have another *3*?! \n\nIt is his choices, not yours, that have created these deep imbalances.\n\nAnd if he isn\u2019t paying child support to your mother, he can consider that her extreme charity handout", "NTA and by the way at your age no judge is going to force you to keep going to his house for a couple more months if you want to just let visitation drop. This does not sound fun for you, and your dad doesn't seem to see you as a son to bond with but just a bank account to tap.", "NTA. He's trying to manipulate a 17yo like you're a 7yo. Your dad is a problem.", "Ya, right. Do his job for him. Doesn't he know they could both get a part-time job to pay for Christmas, not mooch off his ex. NTA. Sorry you deserve so much better than that. Your mother did a great job of raising you. You could have turned it all back on him.", "His dad has TEN people in total living in ONE 3 bedroom house. TEN people that OP had ZERO responsibility in creating....is it crack?", "One has a feeling that OP is counting down the number of months before that court mandated visitation is annulled when 18 rolls around.", "If money was tight, he shouldn\u2019t have had more kids.  I assume he know where babies come from", "He\u2019s also old enough to not have kids he cant afford to provide for. He married a woman with 3 kids already then had 3 more kids with her..!", "This 100%!!!! It is not your job to provide for your father's family, especially when he had them knowing  they couldn't really afford it. Your mom sounds amazing, don't let him use her for his other kids, they're none of her responsibility!!", "Sibling who've grown to resent OP, because she should be in their same misery", "I agree.  When they married, they already had four kids between them.  That's already a lot to support.  Then they had three more bio kids and two nieces they took on.  That's going to make most people live near the poverty line.  \n\nI had two kids because I worked full-time and wanted to provide very well for the kids I had.  Sports, college, etc.  I feel for kids that come from families that are huge and can't afford things they need.", "The BEST response!!!!!", "NTA\n\nGood advice.  As mentioned above start going only for day time visits between meals.  If the hostility continues cut down your time spent there even further.  If your father talks about legalities be sure to mention to him you will tell the judge he wants you to help support his family.", "And who is to pay for that?  OP's mom?  Don't be ridiculous.  She has no ongoing relationship with ex and her son is not close too all those siblings.  OP watch out because when you start earning your father will expect you to financially support.  Do not start that.  It's a never ending hole - 2 people without good jobs and 4 kids between them choosing to have 3 more and take in 2 others.  Quicksand.", "Small gifts for 8 kids?  Even at $25 each that is what $200?", "oh please.  The dad made his bed years ago.  OP is NOT scrooge.\n\nEDIT -- he is 17, any money he has is likely from his mom housing him, etc.   He should not be encouraged to take what is mom's money to give to her ex", "You have an absolutely incorrect take on this. It is never incumbent upon a child to help their parent provide. And it is especially not the responsibility of the parent\u2019s ex-wife to help provide. OP, ignore this boob.", "If OP were independently wealthy, I might agree that he could, out of kindness, provide for his father\u2019s second family.\n\nHis father isn\u2019t asking HIM to pay; he\u2019s asking his ex-wife to pay.

His son is 17 and his ex wife has no relationship to the children in question. \n\nIts laudable that OP\u2019s father took in 2 extra children but its not right to try to guilt his child into wheedling gifts/money from his ex-wife. \n\nOPs father needs to look into other opportunities to get low cost gifts - USPS, angel trees etc. and he should be ashamed of himself for trying to rope his first born into taking responsibility for his children.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
