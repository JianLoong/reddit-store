Things are not that friendly between them. I'm not sure of the why, just that they prefer to stay apart and I have always been okay with that. It's my normal and I never expected them to act all friendly with each other. My dad is remarried and has a big blended family at his house. His wife brought three kids into the marriage, dad brought me, they had three more kids together, they took in his wife's two niece's as well. I'm not really close to my dad so I'm not really close to any of his other kids. I spend only one weekend a month with him now, which was my choice and the courts supported when I was 14.\n\nOne thing that probably doesn't need to be explained in a lot of detail but I will mention is they don't really have a lot, my dad's household. Neither he or his wife have great jobs, no child support is paid and things are always tight there. When I was younger and was there every other week it was pretty crappy. Everyone is crammed into the three bedrooms they have. Meals were always kinda crappy and not exactly filling most of the time. Christmas and Birthdays were very modest as well.\n\nMy mom never remarried and focused on providing for stability. I never went without with her and she always did her best to provide me with nice things, both stuff I needed and stuff I wanted. My quality of life was better with her and I was happier with her. It helped that my mom showed me that she cared and that I was a priority. I never really felt that way about my dad but especially when he remarried and his finances took a bigger hit, it always felt like he was bitter and resentful that I was so much better provided for at moms.\n\nThe other kids at dad's house were aware that I had it way better with my mom. They resent me for it. Some of them hate me and think I should have been forced to not see my mom so we'd all have the same.\n\nThis year dad told me that I should have more of an understanding and compassion for \"all my siblings\" and I should talk to mom about helping me pay for gifts for them. He said I might not be able to afford much but mom should be making sure the other kids get something nice from me and showing me how to be a good older brother to all of them. He also mentioned household gifts to make life a little easier. He told me to ask. I made it clear to him that I will not asking mom to spend money on his household. Dad's response was I am totally old enough to put more care into my family and want to see them all have a better Christmas. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702739421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jt6se/aita_for_making_it_very_clear_to_my_dad_that_i_am/", "score": 1995, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
