I said I was at work but he asked if I could take a break, go home and let the children facetime him for 10 minutes. I said I was sorry but refused. I promised I'd have the kids see him post surgery but he started arguing with me. He said that it was unfair enough I didn't let him have the kids the day before and that he felt like facetiming them before the surgery was reasonable enough. I had to end the call since there was so much commotion for my coworkers to hear. His girlfriend called back but I refused to respond.\n\nI got off work at 7pm and his girlfriend called asking if \"I was happy\". and said that he literally cried after the call was ended and after I refused to do what he asked.

In the way you\u2019ve described your pov, you come across as cold and self-centered.  This was an exceptional situation that warranted consideration on your part.

He led a healthy lifestyle, but there was a genetic component.   \n\n\nHis kids were adults when we got married, but had been misled about the cause of the original break-up - DH didn't tell them that their mother had committed adultery and she allowed them to believe that their father was to blame.  \n\n\nHe had to go into hospital. His son and DIL were supposed to visit a couple of weeks after the surgery. There were complications and a second op was required. I got a breezy phone call from the DIL : 'There's no point in our coming up while John's still in hospital. We'll come up in October instead, when he's home.'  \n\n\nMy husband had nearly died. He'd been having open-heart surgery for a triple graft bypass.   The sternum burst open after the op and they had to open him up again to rewire it.  \n\n\nI realised afterwards that the ex had minimised everything that my husband was going through. Even after he died 11 yrs later,  I discovered that they'd had no real understanding of his operation.   \n\n\nI totally understand that the OP doesn't want to frighten her children, but the decent thing to do would have been to let the man speak to his children.", "NTA for not leaving work to go home\n\nBut majorly YTA for not allowing him to see the kids before his surgery", "Info: do you use the kids as a card to get back at your X.

You too could\u2019ve been a little more understanding and offered a compromise rather than digging your heels in out of stubbornness. I\u2019m not surprised that he was upset, he was already emotionally fraught just before surgery which can be a very worrying time.

But yeah you had the court order applied to the letter.\n\nwhere is your heart seriously, whatever resentment you have toward him, he is still the father of your children.", "YTA. In the future, I'm sure that there are gonna be situations where you want to spend time with the kids during the days when they're with their father. Times I know that he's going to tell your sorry ass no. When he does, remember how selfish you were during this occasion and know that it's karma coming back to bite you.", "YTA - not for not leaving work but there is no real reason not to give him an extra day under these situations. You didn\u2019t even need to give him a full day just let him take the kids to his place, a park etc for a few hours. You say you couldn\u2019t switch time because of work, but you completely miss not every single instance needs to be a direct amount of switched time.

Why couldn't you let the kids see him before a freaking surgery?", "I would say N T A for not leaving work but YTA for not letting him have them the day before or trying to workout some way for him to see them before heart surgery.

When you declined to switch days with him you could have offered an alternate way to contact them (like facetime).\n\nThey also suck for assuming that you could just drop everything at the last minute and run home. If they wanted to FaceTime with the kids then they needed to schedule that in advance.\n\nPoor planning and communication all around.", "ESH. Why couldn't they FaceTime whomever was babysitting the kids? The post suggests that they were at your home with a caregiver. \n\nYou could've let the gf pick them up that day before the surgery or something, but idk what the situation is with her or how well the kids know her, so hard to say.", "So I am divorced and a single parent.

My ex is literally horrible but I would NEVER deny him of something like this.

Ur kids will know about this in the future. I hope", "INFO\n\nWhen he first asked to have the kids the day before, did he give you much notice? Could you have reasonably managed the change in arrangements in the timeframe he gave?\n\nFurther, how serious (without going into more detail than you need to) is this surgery?\n\nThis was either poor planning on his part, or a complete lack of flexibility and empathy on your part but there's not enough here to say which imo", "You are a petty asshole. Not to mention there is minimal information in your story. As a divorced father who fought hard for his kids I find you a vengeful petty self righteous asshole. My ex did the same shit. Thinking it hurt me but it just hurt the kids. They know the truth now and have a lot of animosity towards their mother because of her petty bullshit. I hope it hits you ten fold.", "YTA you weren\u2019t even with your kids when he requested if he could have them for one day before his surgery. Your bitterness is showing. If you are about to go under surgery with the risk of death and he denies you time to visit it will be what you deserve", "YTA. You wouldn't have needed to leave work in the first place if you'd worked something out when he asked you initially, so that argument is invalid. It sounds like just an excuse you made up because you realize damn well your behaviour is petty. Not letting your kids see their dad (and vice versa) before he goes into surgery is just a straight up AH move, unless there's a very good reason for it. Needless to say, \"I refused to try and compromise to spite my husband\" doesn't qualify as such.\n\nAlso, put your kids first ffs. They didn't ask for separated parents, and if this situation is examplary for how they are being used in your squabbles with your husband, you're destroying their youth and basically setting them up for some very serious mental health issues down the line. Get over yourself.", "NTA, Seems a bit harsh for them to expect you to just pick up and go. What if you lose your job or get hours cut because they don't think you value the job?

How would you feel if roles were reversed?", "YTA. You could have made time the day prior for him to see them and then you could have avoided the whole situation the day of. Sounds like you were being petty and should reevaluate what is important.

You should have let him have the kids the day before or your mother who was watching the kids could have pretended she was an adult long enough to allow his kids to FaceTime him.

And it absolutely would have been your fault.\n\nJust wait until you need something from him and he tells you no. You're supposed to be a coparent. It definitely sounds like you are being purposely vindictive. As a child of divorce let me tell you what that gets you. Resentment from your children. I still remember everything that my parents did to each other and me since I was the one who missed time with them because of it.", "YTA and I\u2019m sure you know you are. Not allowing him to see his children the day before surgery Is incredibly petty. Did he break your heart ? You sound extremely bitter. I know that coparenting is hard but the kids come first.
