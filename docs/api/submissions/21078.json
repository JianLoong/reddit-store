They didn't mention any of those reasons to me though", "Exactly. I was on a plane once, seated in an aisle seat next to a very large guy. Airline staff said if he could put the armrest down he was in his seat. He lifted up a fat roll, wedged it down over a fat roll and dropped the first fat roll over it. I just turned to the staff with a WTF look, economy plane seats aren't that big and I don't care what people weigh as long as they don't have fat rolls in my seating space. They just said the flight was full with no spare seats. I could hang over into the aisle, but it blocked trolleys and staff got pissy until word got to them I had 2/3rds of a seat at best. Plus we were a few rows in front of the bathroom and fellow fliers got pissy I was leaning into the aisle and one idiot put their handbag on my head and abused me when I moved. Huddling up to fat guy was better than being a handbag prop.\n\nI don't blame large guy, he had one seat and fitted into it according to the airline. If he'd bought 2 seats he should have 2 seats even if someone thought his \"spare\" seat was better than theirs. In the airline's defense I had a connecting flight plus 2 flights back again and got an exit row seat on two of them and a tail end seat with no one next to me on the other and since I was flying alone I didn't pay to choose a seat. I thought a seat was a seat until I didn't get a full one, after that experience I'm more than happy for anyone to get their paid for seats as long as I get mine, in whole, as paid for. And what I get others should get, being a seat, in whole, paid for. Even if that means they get 2 seats if that's what they paid for."]}
