Apparently their other child doesn't want to go to church either but didn't realize that was an option not to--sometimes seeing someone else do it gives you the courage to stand up for yourself. You didn't do this intentionally, it's just a natural progression.\n\nAnyway the parents are just going to alienate everyone if they keep pushing this issue.

Because this might turn into a massive issue in the near future.\n\nIf there isn't anywhere, there is something to be said for keeping your head down to keep the peace till you can sort something out.  Going along to church and not rocking the boat.  You may meet some other people your age that you actually like and get on with (who also might not want to be there), or you may actually find there's something there for you.\n\nThere's also something to be said for growing your hair long and using wireless earbuds (your long hair will hide them) and listening to something else while you are there.

Trying to guilt you into it with the \"acting like a part of their family\" thing is not cool at all.

You're never wrong for avoiding church....especially the kind where they try to guilt you into going.", "NTA- This is coming from an extremely Devout Christian, when I was younger I HATED going to church. We always had to wake up early sunday morning even if I had a marching comp the night before, my dad consistently grilled it in me. He was also a single father until recently being remarried, but consistently raising me and my brother in the faith. However, my dad cant convert me or my brother, that's a decision we make for ourselves. Sure I liked seeing some people at church, but I was mostly bored sitting through it. News flash, church can be really boring. And you are absolutely right, it can make you feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. Coming before God and surrendering among your peers is hard. Your tios should've talked to you about it before, incrementally bringing things up at a comfortable level for you. Death is very hard to comprehend and truly understand for anyone, and my heart goes out to you about your dad, if I lost mine it would break me, and its horrendous to see that your tios are taking advantage of your low point.\n\nIt is not your fault. It's not your fault he died, it's not your fault you had to move in with them, it's not your fault that your cousin is making her own decision on what she wants to do. It's often *cool* to copy the big cousin since she probably admires you and holds you in high regard. That's a discussion between her and her mother, not you. You arent telling the kid to not go or telling your aunt shes bad at parenting, so I see no issue with what you are doing. People forget that even with influence kids still do their own thing. Free will is a biblical concept that your Tios should read over again. If you ever are interested in the faith, just go to a different church. Research if they have kids your age to hang out with, it's kind of like a built in friendship. Please know your dad loves you dearly, and I know he cant wait to see what you accomplished.\n\nEdit: I say tios because its spanish short hand for aunt and uncle because their isnt an encompassing term like there is for spanish, and I didnt want to lose thoughts by writing to slow.", "No and neither are they. But what happened with Leah is really what they were worried about. They got their whole life together with that as a norm, like a tradition for them.  It's almost always the kids that want to break the tradition no matter what it is. We eat at the dinner table in this family. It'll be the kids who are on the couch/taking a plate up to their room. Mom or Dad or both simply enjoy that together and don't want to lose it and kids have less empathy formed on that and the couch/tv beckons above it.  Like my mom didn't care on that except in that my dad did.  When he wasn't home we ate wherever, when he was she was you know traitor to the liberty/couch for supporting him. \n\nThey also sort of want to set a standard for everyone under their charge. Attempt to kindly keep order. Like if you had one kid that had  bad diabetes or something you wouldn't want the other eating rice krispy treats and sugared strawberries right at the dinner table because empathy tells you hey that's hard for him to see and be denied.  In fact the kid w/o a condition is probably going to suffer his fair share of sugar free stuff.  Care triumphs over fair often enough.", "I used to have a Catholic wife.  To keep the piece (for me it actually was \"keeping the piece\") I would take a book I was reading, make a book cover that said \"HOLY BIBLE\" on the front and tape the cover on the book.  Take it to church and enjoy Catholic Reading Hour (actually 45 minutes).\n\nJust a thought.

All I see in your Christianity is hatred and contempt for others, and you spend most of your time making people's lives worse: your religion is homophobic, misogynistic, racist and generally hateful.  Even if it's true, it's still vile: I judge people by their behaviour, and all I need to do is look at Christians to know that even if every word they say is true, they are still foul people behaving terribly."]}
