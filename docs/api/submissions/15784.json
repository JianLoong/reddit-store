Because this might turn into a massive issue in the near future.\n\nIf there isn't anywhere, there is something to be said for keeping your head down to keep the peace till you can sort something out.  Going along to church and not rocking the boat.  You may meet some other people your age that you actually like and get on with (who also might not want to be there), or you may actually find there's something there for you.\n\nThere's also something to be said for growing your hair long and using wireless earbuds (your long hair will hide them) and listening to something else while you are there.

You're never wrong for avoiding church....especially the kind where they try to guilt you into going.", "NTA- This is coming from an extremely Devout Christian, when I was younger I HATED going to church. We always had to wake up early sunday morning even if I had a marching comp the night before, my dad consistently grilled it in me. He was also a single father until recently being remarried, but consistently raising me and my brother in the faith. However, my dad cant convert me or my brother, that's a decision we make for ourselves. Sure I liked seeing some people at church, but I was mostly bored sitting through it. News flash, church can be really boring. And you are absolutely right, it can make you feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. Coming before God and surrendering among your peers is hard. Your tios should've talked to you about it before, incrementally bringing things up at a comfortable level for you. Death is very hard to comprehend and truly understand for anyone, and my heart goes out to you about your dad, if I lost mine it would break me, and its horrendous to see that your tios are taking advantage of your low point.\n\nIt is not your fault. It's not your fault he died, it's not your fault you had to move in with them, it's not your fault that your cousin is making her own decision on what she wants to do. It's often *cool* to copy the big cousin since she probably admires you and holds you in high regard. That's a discussion between her and her mother, not you. You arent telling the kid to not go or telling your aunt shes bad at parenting, so I see no issue with what you are doing. People forget that even with influence kids still do their own thing. Free will is a biblical concept that your Tios should read over again. If you ever are interested in the faith, just go to a different church. Research if they have kids your age to hang out with, it's kind of like a built in friendship. Please know your dad loves you dearly, and I know he cant wait to see what you accomplished.\n\nEdit: I say tios because its spanish short hand for aunt and uncle because their isnt an encompassing term like there is for spanish, and I didnt want to lose thoughts by writing to slow.", "No and neither are they. But what happened with Leah is really what they were worried about. They got their whole life together with that as a norm, like a tradition for them.  It's almost always the kids that want to break the tradition no matter what it is. We eat at the dinner table in this family. It'll be the kids who are on the couch/taking a plate up to their room. Mom or Dad or both simply enjoy that together and don't want to lose it and kids have less empathy formed on that and the couch/tv beckons above it.  Like my mom didn't care on that except in that my dad did.  When he wasn't home we ate wherever, when he was she was you know traitor to the liberty/couch for supporting him. \n\nThey also sort of want to set a standard for everyone under their charge. Attempt to kindly keep order. Like if you had one kid that had  bad diabetes or something you wouldn't want the other eating rice krispy treats and sugared strawberries right at the dinner table because empathy tells you hey that's hard for him to see and be denied.  In fact the kid w/o a condition is probably going to suffer his fair share of sugar free stuff.  Care triumphs over fair often enough.", "I used to have a Catholic wife.  To keep the piece (for me it actually was \"keeping the piece\") I would take a book I was reading, make a book cover that said \"HOLY BIBLE\" on the front and tape the cover on the book.  Take it to church and enjoy Catholic Reading Hour (actually 45 minutes).\n\nJust a thought.

Maryland\u00a0(1961), Justice\u00a0William O. Douglas\u00a0illustrated the broad protections offered by the First Amendment's religious liberty clauses: \n\nThe First Amendment commands government to have no interest in theology or ritual; it admonishes government to be interested in allowing religious freedom to flourish\u2014whether the result is to produce\u00a0Catholics, Jews, or\u00a0Protestants, or to turn the people toward the path of\u00a0Buddha, or to end in a predominantly\u00a0Moslem\u00a0nation, or to produce in the long run\u00a0atheists\u00a0or agnostics. On matters of this kind,\u00a0government must be neutral. **This freedom plainly includes freedom from religion,** with the right to believe, speak, write, publish and advocate anti-religious programs.\u00a0Board of Education v. Barnette, supra, 319 U. S. 641. Certainly the \"free exercise\" clause does not require that everyone embrace the theology of some church or of some faith, or observe the religious practices of any majority or minority sect. The First Amendment, by its \"establishment\" clause, prevents, of course, the selection by government of an \"official\" church. Yet the ban plainly extends farther than that. We said in\u00a0Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U. S. 1, 330 U. S. 16, that it would be an \"establishment\" of a religion if the Government financed one church or several churches. For what better way to \"establish\" an institution than to find the fund that will support it? The \"establishment\" clause protects citizens also against any law which selects any religious custom, practice, or ritual, puts the force of government behind it, and fines, imprisons, or otherwise penalizes a person for not observing it. The Government plainly could not join forces with one religious group and decree a universal and symbolic\u00a0circumcision. Nor could it require all children to be\u00a0baptized\u00a0or give tax exemptions only to those whose children were baptized.\n\n(Bold text is my highlight)\n\nNTA", "NTA.

I suspect that before you even went to live with them, Leah had already tried to argue the point that she didn\u2019t want to go to church, and that your uncle and aunt knew that if you didn\u2019t go, that she would do a \u201cwhat about xxxxx, they aren\u2019t going!  It\u2019s not fair\u201d.  \n\nThey took you into their home, which can be seen as kind gesture on the surface (certainly it\u2019s a good flex to all of the church crowd), but I personally find it reprehensible to play with the idea of family, the feelings of belonging, to a young person who has not long lost his father, and making it look like you are rejecting them, just because you don\u2019t want to go with them to church.  I don\u2019t know which country you live in, or whether it\u2019s a better choice to be living with them or going into foster care, and whether they will push you out if you won\u2019t go to church, but for the next couple of years you need to keep your head down and pass your exams, so you can go in to further education or a trade school, with the goal of living independently.  Only you can do the calculation if it is better to live with them and their conditions, but be warned that it will not stop here.  This is only a Week 1 problem?  Soon they will be \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the way you wear your hair, your style of clothing, use of vulgarity like saying \u201cshit!\u201d or blaspheming, the music you listen to, etc. etc.  Make a mental note of things as they arise, because they will, I assure you.", "They left you to your own devices for two months (to grieve presumably - did they support you in any way?)  *then* decided you should be part of the family *then* decided you should go to church?\n\nHmm, NTA, no not at all.

Its a place of community, support, and in good ones love and kindness. You dont have to believe in the man in the sky to need community, support, love and kindness. To be honest, I cant think of things you need more right now. I lost my Dad when I was 23. Im 40 now. I wish I had spent more time in church and less time numbing the pain with alcohol and work and generally avoiding the hurt and pain I felt. 10 years of my life I wasted, please dont be like me.\n\nId also suggest talking with your aunt and uncle. Tell them you appreciate everything theyre doing for you. You dont have life all figured out, but youre trying. In a family you often do things you dont want because its for the greater good. I think they need you to tow the line a bit more, and its okay to tell them youre not really ready to be in a church, but could you come, sit quietly and journal, or whatever you can do that would help you process the trauma that you experienced and are experiencing, while also respecting how they run the house so to speak.\n\nIn the end, all relationships are about respect and trust. They sound like people that will show you grace as you all go through this, and you sound like an intelligent, kind amazing person that will show them respect and trust.

Some churches have really good groups for support and advice with blending families although usually due to remarriage, not this exact situation but many principles are the same.\n\n\nSo no, youre NTA, and neither are they.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that most wars are actually driven by other factors but then get religious reasons grafted onto them.\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t always mean wars between religions or even wars between sects.

Both sides had a shared religious background (granted, there\u2019s plenty of variation, then and now, I\u2019m not trying to say all sects of a religion get along).
