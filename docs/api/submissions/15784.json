He had terminal cancer, and passed away right when the doctors predicted, surrounded by friends and family, but it still hurts. He raised me all on his own after my mom walked out of our lives, he was my rock, my best friend, and now he\u2019s gone. After he passed, I was taken in by my aunt Shelby and my uncle Alan. They have two daughters; my cousins Leah (14) and Macy (11). \n\nEver since I moved in with them, they pretty much left me to my own devices. That is, until last Saturday evening. Alan came to talk to me and asked me if I had anything nice to wear \u201cfor tomorrow\u201d. I asked what he meant, and he told me that it was about time I started acting like a part of their family, and that I\u2019d be attending church with them the next day.\n\nIn my head, I heard a record scratch. I\u2019m not religious, and church makes me very uncomfortable (I\u2019ve been before). \n\nI tried to talk my way around the issue, but eventually I just came out and said \u201cI\u2019d be happy to start spending more time with you guys, but I\u2019m not religious and I\u2019m not comfortable going to church.\u201d\n\nAlan got quiet for a moment, before awkwardly telling me that he\u2019d have to talk to Shelby about it, and leaving me be in my room. \n\nThe next morning cam and went, and I slept right through them getting up and leaving for church. I was up by the time they came back, and Shelby told me how disappointed she was in me for \u201cnot accepting [them] as [my] new family\u201d. I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I just went up to my room without saying anything. \n\nSo apparently my cousins have this after school church thing they do on Wednesdays, and this morning Leah asked Shelby if she could skip it, on the grounds that I got to \u2018skip\u2019 church. Shelby said no and they got into a big fight, and now everyone is mad at me for causing this whole thing. I don\u2019t want to be a burden or cause any trouble, and I really am grateful to them for taking me in.

They're forcing their beliefs on you. You're entitled to what you believe in. If you're not religious, you're not religious. Others can't change that.", "NTA and I\u2019m not a fan of the \u201cwe are your new family\u201d comments. They have always been your aunt and uncle. Just because they took you in doesn\u2019t mean they automatically become the new \u201cmom and dad\u201d. They cannot and should not be forcing their religion on you, stand your ground. Is there any other family you could stay with if they can\u2019t respect your boundaries?", "NTA\n\nAt your age they kind of know they can't force it on you (which is why he \"went quiet\" and they tried to guilt instead of grounding you). Apparently their other child doesn't want to go to church either but didn't realize that was an option not to--sometimes seeing someone else do it gives you the courage to stand up for yourself. You didn't do this intentionally, it's just a natural progression.\n\nAnyway the parents are just going to alienate everyone if they keep pushing this issue. It isn't your \"fault\", this same fight would have happened anyway after the kid moved out and parents found out they stopped going to church.", "NTA. You didn't cause an issue, the people forcing kids to go to church are causing issues.\n\nAlso, shame on your asshole of an aunt for trying to replace your family you lost two months ago. I'm sorry for your loss OP, and hope there is other family you could live with.", "NTA at all. \n\nReligion isn't a bad thing, but neither is not believing in it. You, just like them, are entitled to your beliefs and it does not make you any less of a family member to not partake. \n\nStand your ground, you aren't doing anything wrong. I hope you are doing alright, friend.", "NTA. I'm sorry you got stuck with cultists. Stand your ground -- the moment you give religious psychos an inch, they'll take a mile.", "NTA you don't believe the mythology they do and there's no reason to force you to join in it", "NTA. It's their own fault for making their children do religious activities when they clearly don't want to.\n\nIt's basically the same with my parents. Parents want to go to church but us 4 siblings never want to and they get pissed about it.", "NTA. They shouldn't force you OR their kids into religion. It is highly immoral to do so, religion should always, always be a choice you get to make with the freedom to say no. You are not causing \"the rift\", they are. Ask them if religious freedom only applies to adults in your country.", "NTA\n\nThis is rock and hard place for you because of your age.  They are being very manipulative in using religion to control you.\n\nAnd it's hard for them to justify why you don't have to go but their child has to - they don't what those conversations with Leah.\n\nIs there anywhere else you can live other than this particular aunt and uncle?  Because this might turn into a massive issue in the near future.\n\nIf there isn't anywhere, there is something to be said for keeping your head down to keep the peace till you can sort something out.  Going along to church and not rocking the boat.  You may meet some other people your age that you actually like and get on with (who also might not want to be there), or you may actually find there's something there for you.\n\nThere's also something to be said for growing your hair long and using wireless earbuds (your long hair will hide them) and listening to something else while you are there.  But down low enough that you will hear if others are talking to you.  And better if you don't have to sit with your aunt and uncle (remember those new friends you might make).\n\nI only say this because you are 16.  If you were 18 and legally an adult, I'd say hold your ground.", "On one hand, I can understand that you're not religious and going to church makes you uncomfortable.  And that's okay.  Honestly, it should stop at \"making you uncomfortable\" bit.  I'm going to go with NTA.", "First off, my condolences to you, I understand that it will still be very raw for you right now and this is the last thing you should have to be worrying about.\n\nYou are most definitely NTA here. The right to religious freedom includes the right to be free from religion, and you have every right to not attend church. Trying to guilt you into it with the \"acting like a part of their family\" thing is not cool at all. I imagine Aunt and Uncle would not stop going to church if circumstances meant they had no choice other than to live with atheist relatives. They're being unfair in the way they've handled this and you have no reason to feel guilty.\n\nI hope your journey gets easier over time and wish you all the best for your future. Take care of yourself.", "NTA.\n\nTo be honest if it wasn't you, it would be some kid at school that inspired your cousins to rebel. Religion should be a choice offered to everyone who is old enough to make that call, and let's face it the cousin is 14, she's probably going to start showing signs of that angsty teenager phase regardless.", "NTA and I'm so so sorry for your loss\ud83d\udc94", "NTA- Your Aunt and Uncle have some very weird ideas about how you should be thinking or feeling about them after only living there two months.", "NTA. You\u2019re going through enough. Calmly hold your ground and let them sort out the issues with their daughters separate of you. Do not engage in any arguing if you can possibly help it. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss OP. I hope you carry your dad\u2019s love with you always.", "Freedom of religion means freedom from religion.\n\nNTA", "NTA- you lost your Dad 2 months ago, and now they want you to \u201caccept them as your new family.\u201d That just wrong, they don\u2019t get to try and replace your dad and the way he raised you. \n\nDo not blame yourself for the fight that their family is having, you are not to blame. Your aunt and uncle should have asked how they could make you feel more apart of their family, NOT tell you how you will feel, and how to be accepted by them. \n\nAs for your cousin she is at the age where a lot of kids start to see through the BS of religion and not want to go. My guess is she has been feeling this way for a while, you just gave her the courage to stand up for herself.", "NTA. You're never wrong for avoiding church....especially the kind where they try to guilt you into going.", "NTA- This is coming from an extremely Devout Christian, when I was younger I HATED going to church. We always had to wake up early sunday morning even if I had a marching comp the night before, my dad consistently grilled it in me. He was also a single father until recently being remarried, but consistently raising me and my brother in the faith. However, my dad cant convert me or my brother, that's a decision we make for ourselves. Sure I liked seeing some people at church, but I was mostly bored sitting through it. News flash, church can be really boring. And you are absolutely right, it can make you feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. Coming before God and surrendering among your peers is hard. Your tios should've talked to you about it before, incrementally bringing things up at a comfortable level for you. Death is very hard to comprehend and truly understand for anyone, and my heart goes out to you about your dad, if I lost mine it would break me, and its horrendous to see that your tios are taking advantage of your low point.\n\nIt is not your fault. It's not your fault he died, it's not your fault you had to move in with them, it's not your fault that your cousin is making her own decision on what she wants to do. It's often *cool* to copy the big cousin since she probably admires you and holds you in high regard. That's a discussion between her and her mother, not you. You arent telling the kid to not go or telling your aunt shes bad at parenting, so I see no issue with what you are doing. People forget that even with influence kids still do their own thing. Free will is a biblical concept that your Tios should read over again. If you ever are interested in the faith, just go to a different church. Research if they have kids your age to hang out with, it's kind of like a built in friendship. Please know your dad loves you dearly, and I know he cant wait to see what you accomplished.\n\nEdit: I say tios because its spanish short hand for aunt and uncle because their isnt an encompassing term like there is for spanish, and I didnt want to lose thoughts by writing to slow.", "No and neither are they. But what happened with Leah is really what they were worried about. They got their whole life together with that as a norm, like a tradition for them.  It's almost always the kids that want to break the tradition no matter what it is. We eat at the dinner table in this family. It'll be the kids who are on the couch/taking a plate up to their room. Mom or Dad or both simply enjoy that together and don't want to lose it and kids have less empathy formed on that and the couch/tv beckons above it.  Like my mom didn't care on that except in that my dad did.  When he wasn't home we ate wherever, when he was she was you know traitor to the liberty/couch for supporting him. \n\nThey also sort of want to set a standard for everyone under their charge. Attempt to kindly keep order. Like if you had one kid that had  bad diabetes or something you wouldn't want the other eating rice krispy treats and sugared strawberries right at the dinner table because empathy tells you hey that's hard for him to see and be denied.  In fact the kid w/o a condition is probably going to suffer his fair share of sugar free stuff.  Care triumphs over fair often enough.", "I used to have a Catholic wife.  To keep the piece (for me it actually was \"keeping the piece\") I would take a book I was reading, make a book cover that said \"HOLY BIBLE\" on the front and tape the cover on the book.  Take it to church and enjoy Catholic Reading Hour (actually 45 minutes).\n\nJust a thought.  If they really start to push the religion then you should definitely stand your ground.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
