Apparently their other child doesn't want to go to church either but didn't realize that was an option not to--sometimes seeing someone else do it gives you the courage to stand up for yourself. You didn't do this intentionally, it's just a natural progression.\n\nAnyway the parents are just going to alienate everyone if they keep pushing this issue.

Because this might turn into a massive issue in the near future.\n\nIf there isn't anywhere, there is something to be said for keeping your head down to keep the peace till you can sort something out.  Going along to church and not rocking the boat.  You may meet some other people your age that you actually like and get on with (who also might not want to be there), or you may actually find there's something there for you.\n\nThere's also something to be said for growing your hair long and using wireless earbuds (your long hair will hide them) and listening to something else while you are there.

You're never wrong for avoiding church....especially the kind where they try to guilt you into going.", "NTA- This is coming from an extremely Devout Christian, when I was younger I HATED going to church. We always had to wake up early sunday morning even if I had a marching comp the night before, my dad consistently grilled it in me. He was also a single father until recently being remarried, but consistently raising me and my brother in the faith. However, my dad cant convert me or my brother, that's a decision we make for ourselves. Sure I liked seeing some people at church, but I was mostly bored sitting through it. News flash, church can be really boring. And you are absolutely right, it can make you feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. Coming before God and surrendering among your peers is hard. Your tios should've talked to you about it before, incrementally bringing things up at a comfortable level for you. Death is very hard to comprehend and truly understand for anyone, and my heart goes out to you about your dad, if I lost mine it would break me, and its horrendous to see that your tios are taking advantage of your low point.\n\nIt is not your fault. It's not your fault he died, it's not your fault you had to move in with them, it's not your fault that your cousin is making her own decision on what she wants to do. It's often *cool* to copy the big cousin since she probably admires you and holds you in high regard. That's a discussion between her and her mother, not you. You arent telling the kid to not go or telling your aunt shes bad at parenting, so I see no issue with what you are doing. People forget that even with influence kids still do their own thing. Free will is a biblical concept that your Tios should read over again. If you ever are interested in the faith, just go to a different church. Research if they have kids your age to hang out with, it's kind of like a built in friendship. Please know your dad loves you dearly, and I know he cant wait to see what you accomplished.\n\nEdit: I say tios because its spanish short hand for aunt and uncle because their isnt an encompassing term like there is for spanish, and I didnt want to lose thoughts by writing to slow.", "No and neither are they. But what happened with Leah is really what they were worried about. They got their whole life together with that as a norm, like a tradition for them.  It's almost always the kids that want to break the tradition no matter what it is. We eat at the dinner table in this family. It'll be the kids who are on the couch/taking a plate up to their room. Mom or Dad or both simply enjoy that together and don't want to lose it and kids have less empathy formed on that and the couch/tv beckons above it.  Like my mom didn't care on that except in that my dad did.  When he wasn't home we ate wherever, when he was she was you know traitor to the liberty/couch for supporting him. \n\nThey also sort of want to set a standard for everyone under their charge. Attempt to kindly keep order. Like if you had one kid that had  bad diabetes or something you wouldn't want the other eating rice krispy treats and sugared strawberries right at the dinner table because empathy tells you hey that's hard for him to see and be denied.  In fact the kid w/o a condition is probably going to suffer his fair share of sugar free stuff.  Care triumphs over fair often enough.", "I used to have a Catholic wife.  To keep the piece (for me it actually was \"keeping the piece\") I would take a book I was reading, make a book cover that said \"HOLY BIBLE\" on the front and tape the cover on the book.  Take it to church and enjoy Catholic Reading Hour (actually 45 minutes).\n\nJust a thought.

Maryland\u00a0(1961), Justice\u00a0William O. Douglas\u00a0illustrated the broad protections offered by the First Amendment's religious liberty clauses: \n\nThe First Amendment commands government to have no interest in theology or ritual; it admonishes government to be interested in allowing religious freedom to flourish\u2014whether the result is to produce\u00a0Catholics, Jews, or\u00a0Protestants, or to turn the people toward the path of\u00a0Buddha, or to end in a predominantly\u00a0Moslem\u00a0nation, or to produce in the long run\u00a0atheists\u00a0or agnostics. On matters of this kind,\u00a0government must be neutral. **This freedom plainly includes freedom from religion,** with the right to believe, speak, write, publish and advocate anti-religious programs.\u00a0Board of Education v. Barnette, supra, 319 U. S. 641. Certainly the \"free exercise\" clause does not require that everyone embrace the theology of some church or of some faith, or observe the religious practices of any majority or minority sect. The First Amendment, by its \"establishment\" clause, prevents, of course, the selection by government of an \"official\" church. Yet the ban plainly extends farther than that. We said in\u00a0Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U. S. 1, 330 U. S. 16, that it would be an \"establishment\" of a religion if the Government financed one church or several churches. For what better way to \"establish\" an institution than to find the fund that will support it? The \"establishment\" clause protects citizens also against any law which selects any religious custom, practice, or ritual, puts the force of government behind it, and fines, imprisons, or otherwise penalizes a person for not observing it. The Government plainly could not join forces with one religious group and decree a universal and symbolic\u00a0circumcision. Nor could it require all children to be\u00a0baptized\u00a0or give tax exemptions only to those whose children were baptized.\n\n(Bold text is my highlight)\n\nNTA", "NTA.

On top of that, we live in a rules-based society where the law of the land we live in prohibits certain actions, e.g. stealing, assault, murder etc. There are consequences for acting solely in one's own interests and with no thought for those with who we live.\n\nI once heard a religious minister question Christopher Hitchens (if I remember correctly) about this point and he replied \"If it's only your belief in God that prevents you murdering or raping your neighbour, I'm glad you believe in the bible\"\n\nUltimately, you do not need to believe in any god in order to live a decent, honest, kind life while showing compassion and love to other people. \n\nIn this regard, we are on exactly the same page.", "Great.\n\nBut that has nothing to do with atheism.", "It's a pretty easy distinction, an example:\n\nLet's say I have a jar filled with marbles.\n\nI say: there's an even number of marbles in the jar\n\nYou say: I don't believe you\n\nThat doesn't mean you believe there's an odd number of marbles in the jar, it just means you're not convinced about me knowing the number of marbles in the jar", "Atheists just believe in one fewer god than people who believe in monotheistic religion", "Isn\u2019t that the definition of agnotiscism?

I'm sure many are aghast at some of the antics of the more extreme of their ilk.\n\nThe problem is the AHs tend to have the loudest voices, the widest audience, the most money and, therefore, the most influence.\n\nAs Christopher Hitchens once said \"I don't care if you sit at home playing with your toys. I don't care if you invite your friends to your house so they might play with your toys but I absolutely refuse to be told that ***I*** must play with your toys\"\n\nThis is the problem for me.
