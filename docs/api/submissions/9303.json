My younger brother got engaged a few months ago and he and his fiance have decided to have a destination wedding in the Caribbean.  I am the best man in the wedding so I obviously have to go.  And since we haven't been on a family vacation since pre-covid, we figured a week at an all-inclusive resort would be a nice break for all of us.  \n\nA couple weeks ago, I was discussing the wedding with my brother and asked how planning was going.  He started talking about the dress code and what their ideas are.  He said they aren't expecting all men to wear suits since it's going to be hot, but they don't want anyone in shorts either.  He said they want all men wear in slacks and a dress shirt, but no ties required.  And for all women to be in a dress.  He said they want everyone to be comfortable, but to also look nice.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see anything wrong with that.  But my daughter is not happy.  She absolutely hates dresses and will go to great lengths to avoid wearing one.  When I told her about the dress code, she said she would not wear a dress and if that's a requirement for the wedding, then she just won't attend the ceremony or reception.  \n\nI told her if she can't wear a dress for a few hours on a single day to attend her uncle's wedding, then she won't have to worry about attending the ceremony, because she won't even be coming with on the trip.  She asked if I would seriously leave her home while the rest of the family goes on a tropical vacation and I told her I would have no problem with it if she's going to raise a huge fuss about wearing a dress for a few hours.  \n\nShe said forcing people to wear something they aren't comfortable in is an outdated idea and as long as she's comfortable and looks nice, it shouldn't matter what she's wearing.  I told her that dress codes for weddings are absolutely a thing and totally up to the couple getting married.  I told her that if she can't adhere to the dress code, then she's not coming on the trip.  I told her I'm not going to let her come with on a vacation that is centered around my brother's wedding, and then have her not attend the wedding because she doesn't want to wear a dress for a few hours.  \n\nMy wife suggested talking to my brother about making an exception for our daughter, so I reached out to him.  He said they really want every woman to be in a dress, but if my daughter is more comfortable in a romper-style dress, that would work too.  But that is also unacceptable to my daughter.  I asked her what she wants to wear and she told me \"I don't know.\"  \n\nAt that point I threw up my hands because she hadn't even thought of alternatives and is just insisting on not wearing a dress.  I told her and my wife that they need to figure out either a compromise with my brother and his fiance, or find a dress that our daughter can wear, but if they can't then she's staying home.", "created_utc": 1675717854, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10viayi/aita_for_telling_my_teenage_daughter_that_if_she/", "score": 1277, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My younger brother got engaged a few months ago and he and his fiance have decided to have a destination wedding in the Caribbean.  I am the best man in the wedding so I obviously have to go.  And since we haven't been on a family vacation since pre-covid, we figured a week at an all-inclusive resort would be a nice break for all of us.  \n\nA couple weeks ago, I was discussing the wedding with my brother and asked how planning was going.  He started talking about the dress code and what their ideas are.  He said they aren't expecting all men to wear suits since it's going to be hot, but they don't want anyone in shorts either.  He said they want all men wear in slacks and a dress shirt, but no ties required.  And for all women to be in a dress.  He said they want everyone to be comfortable, but to also look nice.  \n\nPersonally, I don't see anything wrong with that.  But my daughter is not happy.  She absolutely hates dresses and will go to great lengths to avoid wearing one.  When I told her about the dress code, she said she would not wear a dress and if that's a requirement for the wedding, then she just won't attend the ceremony or reception.  \n\nI told her if she can't wear a dress for a few hours on a single day to attend her uncle's wedding, then she won't have to worry about attending the ceremony, because she won't even be coming with on the trip.  She asked if I would seriously leave her home while the rest of the family goes on a tropical vacation and I told her I would have no problem with it if she's going to raise a huge fuss about wearing a dress for a few hours.  \n\nShe said forcing people to wear something they aren't comfortable in is an outdated idea and as long as she's comfortable and looks nice, it shouldn't matter what she's wearing.  I told her that dress codes for weddings are absolutely a thing and totally up to the couple getting married.  I told her that if she can't adhere to the dress code, then she's not coming on the trip.  I told her I'm not going to let her come with on a vacation that is centered around my brother's wedding, and then have her not attend the wedding because she doesn't want to wear a dress for a few hours.  \n\nMy wife suggested talking to my brother about making an exception for our daughter, so I reached out to him.  He said they really want every woman to be in a dress, but if my daughter is more comfortable in a romper-style dress, that would work too.  But that is also unacceptable to my daughter.  I asked her what she wants to wear and she told me \"I don't know.\"  \n\nAt that point I threw up my hands because she hadn't even thought of alternatives and is just insisting on not wearing a dress.  I told her and my wife that they need to figure out either a compromise with my brother and his fiance, or find a dress that our daughter can wear, but if they can't then she's staying home.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Is there any reason in particular that she wont wear one? If she doesnt want to adhere by someone else's wedding dress code then by all means youre right: she can just stay home. I would do the same thing if someone was being so unreasonable. She has a choice of wearing a dress and going on a FREE vacation or not and stay home.

But it doesn't mean she should be left home ALONE when she's only 15, while everyone else is going to a destination wedding! C'mon OP. What happens with emergencies and everything?

Why can\u2019t she wear slacks and a shirt? If an event forces dated gender norms, anyone who does not feel comfortable complying should be encouraged to not attend, not punished for standing up for themselves. Your daughter provided an excellent compromise: she does not support requiring women to wear gendered clothes, so she will not attend.\n\nYou escalated by punishing her and refusing to allow her to be part of the family vacation. It\u2019s not like she wants to show up in gym clothes or wear a white gown\u2014she just wants the same flexibility her brothers get. You\u2019re punishing her for wanting to be treated equally.

Emily Post and Ann Landers would be mortified at all of you. \n\nWhen it comes to an occasion like a wedding, the hosts (in this case the bride and groom) may absolutely indicate a dress code which should be adhered to, but that's meant to give the guests an understanding of the LEVEL OF FORMALITY of the occasion. A dress code is absolutely not a uniform - with perhaps the exception of the strictest of white tie, where floor length ballgowns and literal white ties and waistcoats are normally prescribed . . . and even then, more than one famous woman (see: Marlene Dietrich, Katherine Hepburn, etc.) has been simultaneously renowned for their beauty and menswear looks on just such occasions.\n\nMy own incredibly conservative, traditional mother was more than happy to suggest to, and then outfit my very tomboyish 16-year-old self, in gorgeous flowy crepe trousers and a silk blouse for a formal family occasion more than 30 years ago, back in the '90s, and everyone including her told me how pretty (and yes, appropriate) I looked. \n\nMy point is: you're saying that this wedding isn't even formal. So not only is it totally inappropriate for the hosts to prescribe \"dresses\" specifically for anyone (gendered dress codes are not a thing in actual social etiquette standards), but there are plenty of options for your daughter to dress appropriately for a semi-formal wedding that do not involve a dress . . . or even a romper: a cute menswear look along the same lines as what you or your sons are wearing, with her hair done nicely and some low heels; flowy pants in a silky fabric and a cute camisole in velvet or some other nice fabric; tailored pants and a similarly dressed-up top. I can think of SO MANY possibilities. \n\nYTA. You're not trying to get her to dress appropriately for the occasion, and neither is your brother. This whole dress code is weird and sexist, and not even appropriate by etiquette standards.", "Leaving your daughter behind will cause a huge rift between you and your daughter.  YTA if you do this.  She is a child and trying to find her own identity and you are squelching that.\n\nI suggest you and the entire family enjoy the holiday and if she doesn't wear the appropriate attire required at *this* wedding (whole 'nother matter but your brother has a stick up his ass) then leave her in the hotel room with her phone and see her later in the evening.\n\nBefore you do anything rash, such as leaving her behind, I hope you see that this will be harmful and long lasting to all of you.  When this wedding is long forgotten, you will be left wondering if it was worth the price.", "YTA. She's not in the wedding party. Therefore a specific costume is not required. You and your brother are demanding specific clothing instead of a code of presentable event appropriate clothing.", "YTA\n\nSo, let me get this straight. Your brother is forcing all the female guests to wear one particular item of clothing, which isn't known for its comfort level while making accommodations for the men attending the wedding. It will be hot and humid for both sexes there; why should accommodations be made for the comfort of one but not the other?\n\nOh but that's not all! When she offered up a compremise (she goes to the holiday but not the wedding if she has to be uncomfortable) you tell her she has to stay home rather than going on a very fancy holiday, because of one day of it which requires an outdated dress code that she would rather be comfortable than please.\n\nYour daughter was the only mature one here.", "YTA \n\nIf this is doubling as a family vacation, her not attending the wedding shouldn\u2019t impact if she can go on the family vacation. It\u2019s a punishment that makes no sense.\n\nHell, I wouldn\u2019t even think of punishing my kid at all if they said \u201chey, I don\u2019t want to go to the wedding. I do want to go on a family vacation.\u201d I had the option of attending or not attending weddings in my youth and sometimes I chose to not go. I wasn\u2019t punished for this. \n\nI\u2019m trans and I wouldn\u2019t have been caught dead in a dress at that age, one time I tried to wear one and I cried. I\u2019m definitely not saying your daughter is trans, but I\u2019m saying that certain clothing can be more uncomfortable for someone than you think. Unless she\u2019s demanding to attend the wedding in an outfit not permitted, I\u2019m not seeing why you are punishing her so harshly.", "YTA for sure. I don't see why she can't go and not attend the wedding.. that seems like a reasonable compromise. Yes it's up to the couple to determine the dress code. Meaning formal, semi-formal, cocktail, etc. and guests should wear something they are comfortable in within those categories. Not a specific garment. That is so fucking weird and unreasonable of them and you.", "This dress code confuses me:  the bride and groom don't want shorts.  They don't want to see men's bodies (requiring slacks and dress shirts, which are generally long sleeved) but they want women in dresses, which show legs and, considering the location, generally will include at least arms?\n\nThese gendered dress codes are ridiculous.  You can say \"no shorts, please\" and get the same effect.  Frankly, dresses are much cooler than slacks and a dress shirt and I'm surprised more men don't choose to wear skirts in the Caribbean.  \n\nESH until your daughter proposes an alternative that meets with the general dress requirement.  She may not be comfortable showing that much of her body, so let her lead you to an appropriate choice.  If that involves slacks, I hope you support her.  If it involves shorts, you should not.", "It sounds like you asked your daughter what she wanted to wear in the middle of an argument when tensions were already high. Maybe she\u2019ll come up with an idea for an appropriate outfit after she gets some time to settle down. Imo this is not a situation to get worked up over.", "YTA\n\nThis is a pretty sexist dress code. If you're really not willing to stand up for her, at the very least ask her if she's willing to wear the men side of the dress code, that way she's not gonna stand up with something just completely different and she gets to not feel uncomfortable af for the whole thing.", "YTA, what is up with posts about people forcing women to wear dresses. \nA dress code indicates the fanciness, it doesn't dictate exactly what people have to wear. \nWork with her to find something appropriately dressy that's she's comfortable in, without being a jerk about it.", "YTA. There is no reason that a female should have to wear a dress. Its sexist, at best. But if your brother demands it, then she doesn\u2019t need to go to the wedding, but removing her from the entire trip is just nuclear. \n\nThe first thing my 50-something mom said to me after I got engaged was: \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to wear a dress do you?\u201d I told her no, and we ended up working together to find a nice pants-based outfit for her.", "YTA You don\u2019t exclude your 15yo daughter from a family vacation because of clothing issues.\n\nOffer her to wear slacks and a shirt instead of a dress, and she\u2018ll fit in with the men.

I can understand your daughter not wanting it be dictated that she MUST wear a dress. Your daughter is right \u2014 it\u2019s 2023, you/your brother can\u2019t mandate that she wears a dress when there are other equally as acceptable outfits that are appropriate for this occasion (the romper look being one that\u2019s currently popular.)\n\nThat said, your daughter also needs to be reasonable and proactively try to find a solution. Currently, it just sounds like she\u2019s stamping her feet about wearing a dress. I\u2019d tell her you\u2019re open minded but would task her with proposing another alternate wedding appropriate outfits instead that she would be comfortable wearing.", "YTA!! What the hell is with all these weddings requiring anyone AFAB at wear a damn dress?

I prefer dresses but think this is a bunch of outdated dark ages BULLSHIT!!!", "Im not particularly surprised a girl that isnt comfortable wearing a dress would be uncomfortable wearing a romper too. This sounds like the first time she is in a similar situation and instead of open minded supportive parenting she is getting threats. Lol man, uncool. She likely said she didnt know what she wanted to wear, because that is exactly the case. She is confused and being cornered to comply. I know grown people who will choose this hill to die on. No wonder a teenager is digging her heels in in this set up. \n\nAt the moment YTA, and this dresscode is pretty lame. If you want to deescalate the situation, come up with different solutions and let her choose what actually works for her. There are so many reasons why she may not like dresses: there is a good chance she either doesnt like too feminine attire; or is self consious about her body; or is feeling too exposed; etc, etc. Instead of threatening to take away the whole holiday, try suggesting: \n- the other acceptable attire: slacks and a shirt\n- a jumpsuit\n- a dressy top and high waisted wide trousers\n- to go shopping together and see what works best\n\nThere are lots of things she can wear, that are both fitting for a wedding guest and not a dress / romper.

Does she like skirts, or does she normally stick to shorts/trousers etc? What has she chosen to wear at special occasions & formal events in the past?\n\nI ask because this level of discomfort with wearing dresses seems quite particular. One of my cousins was always super uncomfortable in dresses/skirts etc. too, and kicked up a stink over it for formal events (so no one forced her to wear them). Turns out, she's nonbinary! So basically that discomfort over dresses was always more about her feeling uncomfortable with dressing in overtly feminine styles, when she was still unsure about that part of her identity & struggling to articulate that discomfort.\n\nYou haven't really provided much context on your daughter in general, so it's hard to know whether this is a one-off stubbornness, or a pattern of behaviour about how she feels most comfortable dressing & presenting herself. Punishing her by excluding her from a family trip just because she doesn't want to wear a dress seems like an overreaction, when it doesn't sound like you've actually tried sitting down and talking to her about where her discomfort is stemming from.\n\nYour attitude in the comments is giving \"I don't care about feeling uncomfortable in an outfit for a few hours, so everyone should feel about it exactly the same way I do\". Teenagers are at a v self-conscious stage of life anyway, so they're generally all quite picky about appearances (in my experience), and that's without considering that for some people presentation & self-expression is linked to their personal identity much more closely, so they might have stronger feelings about \"conforming\" than, for example, you do. It doesn't sound like you've tried being particularly empathetic or tolerant towards your daughter's feelings, because you want her to just go along with your brother's wishes.

She already feels panicky about how she\u2019ll be perceived and you just WAY upped the stakes for her, and really sealed in the idea that what she wears is a big freaking deal that every one will care very much about. Which is worst case scenario for a 15 year old. You\u2019ve gotta dial back the alarm bells. You freaked her out a bit. \n\nYou asked her for alternatives, but how is she supposed to know what the alternatives are? She has no life experience. Why don\u2019t you guys try googling \u201ctropical wedding guest jumpsuits\u201d or \u201ctropics wedding guest outfits with pants\u201d or maybe post to a female fashion advice subreddit for help. The truth is, neither of you really know what her options are. Tropical destination weddings aren\u2019t in your day to day routine. If you both just take a breath and take some time to actually look some inspo outfits, and maybe give her a budget and some time and see what she can come up with.", "Soft YTA. \nYour daughter is right, gendered requirements are icky. I recommend letting her wear slacks, or culottes. If she doesn't want to risk a sharp gust of wind showing everyone her underwear, that's her business. If she just doesn't like dresses, also her business. She could also go on the vacay and not attend the actual ceremony, if that brings joy.", "I'm torn here, because at first I thought YTA, by not giving her options, but although exasperated, you sort of tried. Also, it sounds a little like your daughter might be struggling with her gender identity, I'm not trying to jump to conclusions, I don't know her, but it would be good to dig deeper on why this is such a big deal for her. Also, the people saying she's entitled and the world doesn't revolve around her, you were raised by strict parents and it shows, I have spent most of my life taking care of children from different backgrounds, and the thing they all have in common is, they can be talked to like people, and they share more when you listen to what they're not saying, also, a dad's duty is to make his kids feel safe, not like they won't be listened to on a simple accomodation, also, she's a guest among many, not even part of the wedding party.", "I absolutely HATE dresses and I have since I was a child. But that said there are plenty of alternatives that can help make your daughter more comfortable and still meet the dress code. Bike pants under a dress, romper, jumpsuit. There are some really beautiful options so she can be comfortable and meet the dress code. \n\nYTA because you are trying to punish your daughter instead of working with her to make sure she feels accepted as she is and still conform for a formal occasion. This is something she will have to learn as an adult, so help her instead of jumping straight to \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d", "I went to a wedding last summer and there were 2 female couples. I am pretty sure they all identify as she/ her. I could be wrong, and if so, I apologize. One couple was a very dapper female in a mens cut suit, and her very hot girlfriend. The other couple was both wearing suits. One was definitely a man's cut, the other was more neutral. \nAnyway, if the dress code is full length slacks or a dress/ skirt. Those are the choices for your daughter. Take your daughter to a store and find her a pair of slacks.", "YTA, and so is your brother. They can decide \\*level of formality\\*, but insisting that women wear dresses is absurd, and you saying you won't take her on the trip is terrible.", "YTA. No-one would bat an eye if she were to be there wearing nicely pressed dress slacks and button down shirt. If your brother wanted all the *men* to wear a dress, would you do so without putting up a fight?", "YTA and so is your brother. It's wild that people are up in arms over someone not wanting to adhere to a clearly gendered dress code in 2023.\n\nYour daughter isn't making everything about herself by not wanting to wear clothing that makes her uncomfortable.", "Unpopular opinion.\n\nYTA and so is your brother. I'm floored that people think it's ok to tell someone what they must wear.", "My reading is that your teen may be gender non-conforming and may have a very concrete vision of how they want to look but that they aren't ready to discuss it or are scared to discuss it with you. OP, are you the type of person to always shut down your kids (or maybe just young women or women in general)? I honestly suspect this is the case. Count how many times you wrote \"told her\" in your post. Count how many times you wrote \"told me.\" I hope your daughter hasn't learned that clamming up when you have a disagreement is the best way for her to feel safe around you or that she hasn't applied that leason to all authority figures.\n\nI also think there's the posibility of you being really stuck in not understanding that your kid has different needs than most kids. Because your kid might just not be ready to climb that particular hill of a conversation of admitting they feel wrong in their assigned gender. It's a steep and potentially treacherous ascent that conversation.\n\nIf I were you, OP, I'd try to make it easier for my kid to talk to me by not trying to fill the silence of a teen putting together their emotions and words by demanding a decision that second or that day or that week even. Basically, prioritize your kid if they are trying to tell you that they feel wrong in their body over a wedding. Most weddings end up blending together once you go to enough.\n\nTruthfully, I think you may be applying the wrong leason overall and are making requests of the wrong family members to change.\n\nAnd of course you bring your kid on the trip. If you demand a punishment, which would be wrong to do, don't let her bring her phone or computer on the trip. Isolating a kid who is figuring shit out and not even being rude about it as far as I could see is a way to have your kid not trust you. Teen brains are rewiring themselves and are mastering interpersonal relationship cues and practicing behaviours based on what they are learning about themselves and the world. Do you want to wire distrust of you (and other authority figures) into their new process of understanding the world?\n\nI bet when your teen was a kid, you said that you'd always be there to listen to her and to talk things through with her and that you wanted her to be the type of person who could clearly and persistently speak up for themself and to strive towards fairness and being welcoming of guests even if they need different things to feel fully welcome. Because that's what your daughter is in the wedding, a guest. And now you are modelling different behaviour and values when your daughter does speak up for herself and has clearly said to you that she does not feel comfortable in a dress, in a quite extreme way that she likely got to the cusp of telling you something that could be life-destroying for her, depending on your reaction and on the level of hatred the government of your state promotes.\n\nYou are right that an hour or two or three in a dress wouldn't be an issue for most teens. But the fact that your kid has reacted so much and so consistently to wearing dresses means that you are not dealing with \"most teens.\" You know this. You may not understand it, but you know wearing a dress may be hurting your child in a fundamental way. And those kind of hurts leave scars that your kid will have to learn to accept and work around, with both of projects potentially being lifelong ones.\n\nSo YTA so far, but you have the potential to right this ship and not sink it any further by focusing on piling other family members' heavy whims on the back of your kid's psyche. Then you will need to repair the ship and let your kid guide you in how the repairs need to happen. But this is what parenting is, right? Teaching your kid how to take over for you when you die? And one thing they must take on is how to allow someone to be forgiven but to demand that real work is put into earning the forgiveness. They must learn both sides: how to earn forgiveness and how to hold others accountable. Good luck.", "Info: if the \"dress code\" was all men in pretty dresses... would you agree to it?

Not every teenager is TRYING to be difficult. Most of the time there's something else going on that they cannot or maybe don't feel like they can talk about.

Which leads me back to you needing to step up and figure out what would work for you and her while honoring your brothers dress code wishes.  Ask your daughter to go through Pinterest and find alternatives that she is comfortable in and for a semi formal dress code.  Maybe having a visual will help ease the conversation.  Does she want to look more masculine? Pants and a button down?  Is it appropriate for the setting and the level of dressiness?  Ask her why she doesn\u2019t like dresses?

Despite my ever loving hatred for dresses, I found a nice one and wore it to the wedding, because it\u2019s a day about the bride and groom. Not the guests. Sure the focus of the couple is supposed to be on each other, however they also want to remember it as a special event in their lives surrounded by their friends and family.

It\u2019s a bit much, and whilst you\u2019re right and they\u2019re very common, it\u2019s a hot destination and it\u2019s going to cost everybody a pretty penny.

What are her ideas, and how do you find something to compromise it. Does she wear a dress for the ceremony and change into her comfortable outfit later? You need to be her dad and support her whilst working with your brother.

But mostly she needs to understand that wedding dress codes are a very big thing, and when she\u2019s a little older and everyone around her is getting married, she\u2019s going to have to be uncomfortable for a few hours.

Have you also perhaps considered that the reason she said \"I don't know\" is because she doesn't believe you will be supportive? \n\nIf this was my kid, I would tell her that she means the world to me, and that it is important to me that my whole family be with me on an important event. I would discuss what the dress code parameters are, and ask if we could explore some options together. I would assure her that even if her choices are not the usual ones, as long as they are formal enough she will be welcomed with open arms. And I would also say that if any wedding doesn't want her there because she doesn't want to wear exactly what they list, then I won't go either.\n\nProbably at this time your daughter is feeling hurt, rejected, and like you don't support her, and that she can not come to you in the future about issues that have made her uncomfortable. You don't even want her there at all, for the whole vacation, if she doesn't conform and do something she isn't comfortable with. What message does that send her?", "NTA - your daughter sounds a bit spoiled and entitled. This is a good lesson as there are many many times in her life where a dress code will be required. If you give in here you are sending her the wrong message which is complain enough and you\u2019ll get your way which is not accurate in life.", "NTA - Isn\u2019t it normal for weddings to have a dress code? Why is your daughter making a big fuss over it? \n\nYou gave your daughter options, which was fair of you. What does your daughter expect to wear? Shorts and a tank top? If she had come up with other acceptable alternatives, then you would be the asshole but she doesn\u2019t.", "YTA-  wear a dress or you don't get to come on a week long family vacation sounds like the most reasonable solution to you? So what if she sits on the beach or in the room for several hours while y'all attend the ceremony and reception.   Why is this the anthill you insist on tying her to?", "NTA.. at least there is a compromise..", "> But that is also unacceptable to my daughter. I asked her what she wants to wear and she told me \"I don't know.\" \n\nThis made me lean NTA here. I get where your daughter is coming from regarding outdated gender stereotypes with women having to wear a dress, but when you get to the point where she won't even say what she wants to wear it just comes across like she just doesn't want to go in the first place.\n\nWas there any consideration to a compromise where she goes for the men's outfit instead? Not necessarily like the exact thing but like there's of course plenty of feminine dress slacks and blouses that could still probably match the \"formality\" level they're aiming for on the men's side.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's your brother's wedding, and they can set whatever dress code they want. I think it would be rude/discriminatory if he's forcing her into the women's dress code box, but if it's just the formality in general she can't deal with, then I have to put the blame on her here.", "Exactly. I'm glad we've culturally adjusted to giving teens a bit more leeway and accounting for people's different comfort levels, but I think in some ways we've overcorrected. If you don't like the options, you have three choices:  \n1) learn to choose between multiple crappy options (like you will have to do for most of your adulthood)   \n2) suggest an alternative  \n3) do not participate", "For me that is what makes op nta. If you don't have an alternativ suggestion don't complain over things others decide for you.", "I wish I grew up when teenagers made the rules \ud83e\udd23", "EXACTLY.

My daughter had to dress up for a band concert and didn\u2019t want to wear a dress because she was on a stage and wasn\u2019t comfortable in one. But she didn\u2019t immediately know what she wanted to wear until she started browsing for ideas of clothes she might like that would be appropriate.", "Okay but you're ignoring that a proper dress code doesn't dictate what men and women wear, it dictates a level of formality, that can be met in multiple ways.\n\nSaying \"women have to wear dresses\" doesn't even help determine WHAT level of formality is being requested...  cotton sun dresses?  Shiny, sequined cocktail dresses?  What does the brother actually want?\n\nOP is asking his daughter to tell him what she wants to wear, but she doesn't have the actual guidance of dress codes rules from which to figure out an outfit.\n\nHow is she supposed to know what to wear when no one has told her what the formality level of the wedding actually is???\n\nIs OP wearing dress slacks?  Khakis?  Has he shown his daughter what he and his wife is wearing so she can gauge an appropriate option for herself that both matches what others will be wearing and also is comfortable for her?", "NTA\n\nThis was the line that absolutely sealed the deal for me too.", "I was on her side until the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d part, which flipped me to NTA. \n\nIf you want the respect of getting to make adult decisions, show the maturity required. \n\nShe\u2019s 15, this isn\u2019t a huge ask. If she doesn\u2019t want to wear the thing, I get it. I loathe dresses. But being an adult means something like \u201cI recognize there is a dress code expectation, here are three outfits that I would be comfortable in. Do any of these work?\u201d \n\nBut if she\u2019s not going to constructively make an effort to make this work, then I\u2019d probably not want to haul a surly disgruntled teen half way around the world either.", "NTA she\u2019s being unreasonable. If your daughter has an idea of something that would look appropriate and make her comfortable she can send a picture and ask her uncle and his fianc\u00e9 if it\u2019s ok, but if she\u2019s unwilling to try then she\u2019s just being stubborn for no reason. There are a lot of comfortable and nice options for women outside of dresses but then daughter need to make suggestions and work with you guys.", "Yeah like if she'd be more comfortable in slacks and a nice shirt more like what guys were expected to wear that would be totally fair. But if she doesn't even know then what can you do?", "I\u2019m honestly wondering how \u201cromper style dress\u201d was explained to her because a romper is not a dress and calling it one could be confusing?

But she was given the option of two very gendered and inherently \u201cgirly\u201d choices. \n\nI\u2019m also wondering how feminine his daughter chooses to present herself in everyday life. If she\u2019s a little bit of a tomboy, well, maybe it\u2019s time for dad to realize that his daughter ISNT a hyper feminine and might want to always want to wear something more tailored to men\u2019s clothing. \n\nAnd honestly, it\u2019s kind of wild to have such a stick up your butt about the wedding dress code for a 15 year old girl that you would leave her out of a FAMILY VACATION instead of just letting her sit the wedding out. The brother is also an AH for being so weirdly rigid over what a child wears while also asking his whole family to pay for an expensive destination wedding. Some shit just doesn\u2019t matter.

If she hasn't shared that reason with OP maybe it's because she doesn't think he'd understand, which by his reaction to this I would have to agree. If this was the one time she said no to dresses I would think she was being a brat, but this clearly is important to her. Also being told she would be punished if she didn't do something that would make her very uncomfortable, and then suddenly offered an option that may or may not be ok for her and her, I think not having an immediate response is normal.

I guess I\u2019m an AH \n\nLol actually she doesn\u2019t give a shit either way (yet?) but her attending-a-wedding outfit last summer was a lacy dressy blue shirt with cute little frilly\u2026. SHORTS. And she looked very fancy.", ">I wore a pantsuit\n\nBased on the situation, I have a feeling a pantsuit would have 100% ok for the uncle. \n\nHe just wanted people to look nice and presentable for the wedding, often times though that means spelling it out for people.\n\nWhen my wife and I got married, we didn't think we needed to spell out what \"wear something decent meant\" until the day before the wedding when my Wife found out her sister was planning on wearing Jeans, A sweater and cowboy boots.\n\n\"It's my NICE sweater though\" was her response when my wife was like wtf.\n\nShe ended up wearing one of my Wife's old birthday dresses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the teen girl responded with \"I don't want want to wear a dress, can I wear a pantsuit?\". I'm guessing that would have flown just fine.", "I am surprised you think a gendered dress code is weird. Are you really young and live in a very progressive area?\n\nNon-gendered dress codes are a relatively new concept.\n\nI completely support them btw, I just have only thought of them as normal recently and I live in a very progressive place.", ">Her not knowing what she wants and not accepting compromise raise suspicion for me. She seems just peeved about the gendered dress-code, that her father didn't even make, and wanting to pick a fight about it.\n\nNot necessarily. This assumes that a 15yr old can reason and compromise like an adult. Between hormones and figuring out the world, she may not be able to readily come up with options. That's okay. As grownups, we're supposed to *help* teens.\n\nMy nibling sounded exactly like this. They hated wearing dresses and would avoid them like the plague. Every wedding, my sister would offer to take them shopping and together choose something. They wore a lot of dressy jumpsuits for several years but they were always uncomfortable. \n\nOnly recently, they came out as non-binary and suddenly have been much more confident in their clothing choices. It takes a while to figure out what you *like* when everything else feels *wrong*. \n\nOP shouldn't just expect their daughter to know what she wants. Instead, they should talk it out and try to find options together.", "She seems peeved about being told there are limits. Not everything is actually about gender. Sometimes it really is abt just being difficult.", "Where are you getting that she doesn't want to show her legs?", "Yeah real shit I\u2019d wear a dress for a couple hours just to have a chance to go on vacation.", "And OPs daughter said she wouldn't attend. That's her making that choice. Then OP decides to punish her for not wanting to follow an outdated sexist dress code. Cmon.", "Imagine being FIFTEEN, given ONE option and then being expected to come up with another that pleases everyone! What does that give her to work with?? \n\nThe gall of people laying the onus with a child. The absolute disgrace.", "Yeah but it\u2019s somebodies wedding and that\u2019s the dress code they have in place. They tried to compromise even. She\u2019s invited to an all inclusive vacation and I\u2019m sure a very nice ceremony, if she can\u2019t suck it up for the couple for a couple hours she doesn\u2019t need to go on their expensive vacation.", "I agree we can rail against gender expectations in our life, and it may be reasonable to turn down an activity if you find it overburdens you with expectations you disagree with.\n\nBut I also believe when rules are in place and one doesn\u2019t want to follow them, one has to accept the consequences and decline the associated activity or take initiative as an individual to find a compromise. This is how the real world works, no?\n\nAnd so, in this case, where OP\u2019s daughter has had a compromise offered to her which she entirely rejected - offering instead to \u201cjust skip the wedding\u201d, which will definitely make her uncle super happy on his wedding day - I fully agree the OP has to demonstrate how these things work by not allowing their daughter to freely come on a destination wedding vacation and skip the wedding without even talking to her uncle.\n\nDo you think that not even talking to your uncle before you skip his wedding because of an outfit is actually a virtuous, laudable move by this kid?? It looks very childish to me, which is why I find OP justified in not enabling it. It\u2019s kind of the point of parents to help us cull our childish behaviors in our youth, don\u2019t you think?", "She was offered a compromise, refused it and offered no other choice.  She now has a new offer, meet in the middle or stay home.", "> I sure as hell wouldn't exclude them from a family vacation over not wanting to compromise.\n\nLike I said, you'd teach them that saying \"I don't want to do that and I don't have alternate suggestions\" is totally acceptable.\n\n> > if my daughter is more comfortable in a romper-style dress, that would work too. But that is also unacceptable to my daughter. I asked her what she wants to wear and she told me \"I don't know.\"", "To teenagers, anything they don\u2019t like is \u2018obviously bullshit\u2019.\n\nAdults are aware that they won\u2019t always be able to wear/do whatever they want, whenever they want.", "\"Forcing?\" No, it's the price of admission. There is a destination wedding. The cost of attending is wearing a dress. The daughter does not have to pay that price if she doesn't want to; she can stay home.", "And be willing to suck up the consequences to your stand", "I kind of get what your saying but there was an an alternative that was also rejected. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s sexist since the men also have standardized code to adhere to. I\u2019d 100% be with you if it was men wear what you want but women need to wear a specific thing.", "Or even a long legged romper? You can get those really fancy.", "Teenage defiance.  There doesn't need to be a want.  Defiance is the point.  -was defiant teenager once.", "Agreed, she's just being difficult for difficulty's sake. My guess is she doesn't want to attend the ceremony with her family and just wants a paid tropical vacation.", "Oh yeah, I was def one of those teens. My birthday is the middle of December, and one year I wouldn't let my mom put up the Christmas tree until *after*  my birthday passed. Like, wtf? To this day I have no idea why.", "I was imaging a romper/jumpsuit with wide pant legs that would create the \u201clook\u201d of a dress while still having fabric separating the legs.\n\nI hated dresses at this age too and tbh I still dislike the feeling of my bare legs touching each other under a dress, it just makes me feel so naked and exposed for some reason. This would have been an acceptable compromise for me.", "the post said \u201cromper-style dress\u201d which tells me it\u2019s basically a dress with built in shorts. i hate wearing dresses and would not be more comfortable in a romper dress either.", "It doesn't, but the uncle specifically specified \"romper-style dress\". ie, basically just a dress with divided skirts.", ">There's plenty of unisex/plainer options\n\nReally? Because I don't think I've ever seen a man in a romper (aside from gender non-conforming looks like Harry Styles), so even the plainer options still read decidedly feminine to me.", "you basically have to get completely naked to pee in a romper, making them incredibly uncomfortable to wear in public (damn American bathroom stalls with huge gaps) I can see why she'd be uncomfortable in a romper as well", "It doesn't have to be a \"gender expression\" thing. I'm a woman, I identify as a woman, I don't wear dresses. I don't like them, I'm not comfortable in them, I don't like the way people look at me when I'm in them, so I wear suits instead and much prefer that. \n\nBut yeah I also rebelled against dress codes as a teen while I was still figuring all this out. It's part of the process. I personally think it's dumb as hell she can't wear nice pants and a top to a destination wedding, but hey it's their wedding I guess. I'm inclined to agree with others saying \"I don't know\" is probably her being unclear on her non-dress options more than petulance. She's a teenager.", "Nope, 30 and living in a very catholic country. Generally the people who get really bothered about things like that where I live are either very old or ultra conservative. No one else really cares as long as you\u2019re the appropriate level of fancy for the situation.", "It gives her literally every other clothing option available in the world and she couldn't come up with ONE IDEA. LMAO", "Yeah. There are so many things she can wear besides \u201cdress\u201d. My daughter went through a \u201cno dress\u201d phase too, but she was never not dressed appropriately for any occasion.", "A romper was offered as an option that she refused, and she hasn't suggested anything that she wants to wear.", "THIS! People (yes even teenagers) aren\u2019t usually just argumentative for no reason. Usually there is something bothering them and they are having difficulty expressing that in a better way. OP def could use this as a teachable moment on how to express your own style, be comfortable, and be respectful at an important event.\n\nAlso this is from the POV of the dad, he could have no idea why his daughter doesn\u2019t want to wear a dress. Parents can be oblivious to gender dysphoria and differences in gender expression until their child figures it out themselves (and sometimes much later than that).", "I mean, given the drama, she might be scared of the reaction if she asks to wear a suit"]}
