Within that time, there were a couple red flags that I ignored, as he always made it sound like I am overreacting. However, what happened now made me explode. I wish I could write everything he did that made me ,,overreact,, as he says, so you guys can tell me if these were red flags or not, however there is a limit of letters I can use. So I will just write the present situation.\n\n  \nLast week we went to work and he pointed at one of our colleagues \\[F20\\] that was off work for a while. I didn't understand why he is pointing at her and the conversation went like this:  \nMe-What about her? Tom-What a coincidence all of you women dye your hair red after going through something.\n\n  \nI was red since I was 19. I sometimes change it depending on my mood but i always go back to red. However I am pink now. My roots are dark brown and slowly turning to bright pink. This colleague used to be blond, then she turned brown and now came back from sick red. I don't care what her reasons are for going red, it looks good and that's it. I hate people that comment on other people's looks for no reason. \n\n  \nTom- Why do you all copy eachother? Me-Excuse me? I'm pink. But who cares? Red is a pretty color and i don't own it. Anyone can have that color. Tom-No your pink has faded and looks more red then pink. I won't even bother looking for you at work as you look like all the girls there from a distance and your hair color was what made you easy to spot. You should change your hair color. Me-So I should change my color for you? Are you serious? Why does this bother you? Did you tell your ex to change her blond to a different color as every third woman is blond? Tom- But she was natural blond. Me- yes, but she didn't keep it natural blond, she bleached it to have it the perfect typical blond every thrid girl has. Tom- Why are you bringing up my ex? Me- Because i want to know if you controlled her appearance aswell or is it just mine?\n\n  \nWe argued a bit longer, he asked what exactly he said that upset me, and when i explained, he said this ,,I'm glad I got to hear exactly what upset you, as now I know I did nothing wrong, you are just crazy and overreacting,, \n\n  \nI exploded and told him I hate him as he was never like this and that I'm done. He said if I'm ending it, then I better find a way back home as he won't take me. I had to sort out a way back home from work. Since then I'm ignoring his messages. \n\nBefore this happened, he even started to comment on my makeup. There are days I wear less, and then days I wear more, however he started questioning me why I come to work with makeup on. He never did this before. I feel like slowly he is trying to control my appearance and I am not letting him, which causes us to argue. \n\nA part of me is feeling like I am the ass for overreacting over hair.

His saying you overreact is gaslighting and his behavior and remarks show he lacks the maturity befitting his age.", "ESH\n\nHe sounds like an AH. But exploding and telling him you hate him is a bit much. It doesn't seem like you're in a good relationship. Probably best to move on.", "ESH You both sound unbearable. He is a standard jerk and you are wildly insecure.  It was just a stupid comment about hair color.", "ESH.  In general, no guy should ever date a girl who has hair that is not a natural color.  Pink or red or whatever means you are literally wearing a red flag on your head.  Unless you were born a redhead, that is.  The reason for this is simple.  Your boyfriend doesn't need or want your hair to be pink, and you can't see your own hair unless you deliberately look in a mirror.  So the hair color (unnatural) is seeking, demanding and craving attention from people other than your boyfriend.  That's OK, but it also means that attention from your boyfriend is not enough for you.  So a guy choosing to date you is swimming upstream before the first date, even.  Having said that, we will assume your boyfriend is not blind.  So he knew what he was getting into before he made the -unwise-choice to date you.  \n\nYou don't date a girl for two years and then demand for her to change her hair color.", "YTA Yes, in my opinion you were overreacting. Could have been like: Tom: \"You should change your hair color.\" You: \"No, I like IT like that. My hair my choice!\" End of story.\nIs it always a little disagreement like this, that causes so much drama?", "Nta he brought it up just so he could tell you to dye your hair lol", "NTA this is how it starts. Small comments that he can twist to make you feel crazy. Next he\u2019ll critique your friends and how you spend your time, until you\u2019re completely isolated. Then, gawd forbid, you get pregnant and completely entwined. Good on you for seeing Step One and getting out.", "Let him go. He's totally gaslighting you by saying you're overreacting. Nobody needs to have their feelings invalidated.", "NTA. Wrong forum - belongs on r/relationship_advice. And the advice is dump the misogynist loser.\n\n39? \"You women?\" To the streets he goes.", "this guy fkcn sucks NTA", "\"I hate people that comment on other people's looks for no reason.\"\n\nThe comment wasn't simply about her looks. It was about her non-conformity in hair color.\n\nI do not read your boyfriend's comments anout hair as controlling. He expressed a preference for a highly frivolous reason. You are free to say no.\n\nHe further makes a point arguing there is a lack of seriousness in the motives of women who dye their hair a non-conforming color. Clearly an opinion likely to offend you, but it's not controlling, and you didn't call him out on it. But that is the reason he thinks it is reasonable to ask you to change your hair color.\n\nSince this is not an isolated  incident my vote is NTA. If he's going to wander into territory that's guaranteed to offend you, he should apologize in advance or do something to placate you. And I think you're right to feel something off and act on it.", "This. He is pretty much insulting OP then calling her crazy for being upset by it.", "yup. i just had enough. I just exploded. I even said he's jealous because she and i have hair and he doesn't. really sucky of me i know. i just had enough of all his comments. i never put him down, so i thought if i put him down he will know how it feels, however it just made me feel even worse. i dont want to be like him.", "yes i agree. i never was this insecure, however ever since he started putting me down over my appearance im starting to feel ugly. first year he always said he likes how i look and doesnt care what hair color i have or what i wear. however all of a sudden he comments on my makeup, my hair and even comments on my body how skinny and boney i am. he himself is chubby, so i find it weird why is he commenting on my body when he himself isnt perfet. but this probably is just a huge red flag to leave him and gain my confidence back", "> you are wildly insecure\n\nTry not to be when the person you're supposed to trust most in life constantly puts you down.", "Hahah what incel idiocy is this", "lol you are the definition of ,,Does this man f\\*ck?,, :D and answer is no. no he does not. :D", "Your an idiot", "Keep the troll comments to a minimum, sir.", "Boy, bye.", "This is kind of a weird take.  I don't think people dye their hair because they crave attention.  Some people genuinely look better with a different hair color.", "Do you apply this to bleached blond hair? \n\nWhat about beards and various shapes of facial hair? \n\nWhat about clothes? How often do you see your own clothes?", "wow. he actually did worse and im so stupid for not seeing it back then. three months ago me and my two sisters went for holiday to hawaii and we took our partners, well we had so much arguments there as he judged me for always wanting to go where my sisters go and he didnt get to spend no alone time with me in hawaii. we havent been together as sisters for 6 years as one lives in america, the other in europe and i live in the uk. plus the only reason we went to hawaii was thanks to my sister as she got coupons for free accommodation in hawaii. so he should have been thankful and not be mad we spent 10 days all together as a group. :/", "And to try and justify asking her to change her hair color because otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be able to easily spot her vs her coworker\u2026 like wtf?!", "That's the red flag!  If he doesn't like the way you look, you should find someone who does.", "\"This is kind of a weird take. I don't think people dye their hair because they crave attention.\"\n\nIt depends.  Light brown changes to blonde?  Just like changing your shirt from blue to red.  Which one looks better?  OK to try it out...\n\nBut (some natural color) to PINK?????????????   That is a desperate cry for attention, and not from the boyfriend or girlfriend.  No guy ever commented...\"Y'know honey....I think you should die your hair PINK.  I think you would look better that way....\"", "thanks for the honest opinion. saying im wildly insecure is quite harsh but an honest criticism. i need to woman up and gain back my confidence so a comment about hair wont make me feel insecure.", "Besides you being an incel, you're just wrong. No guy has ever wanted his girlfriend hair to be a fun color? My fiance has told me I should dye mine different colors many times. And none of them being normal colors. \n\nHave you ever considered some people just want to have fun with their hair?", "It's txt. My bad. Didn't mean to attack. You sound like you have a handle on the situation. Trust your gut."]}
