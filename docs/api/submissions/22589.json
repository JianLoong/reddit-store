My (M57) son (M23) is engaged to Peggy (F22). They have been engaged for 5 months or so. Our culture dictates that Peggy\u2019s father and I share the costs for their wedding. He (her father) said we should provide $10k each, a total $20k budget. I could afford this sure but This seems insane and extravagant to me. I said I would give $5k and he could give whatever he wanted. Peggy\u2019s father also put up 5k.\n\nI told my son this and he told me outright it wasn\u2019t going to be enough. He said \u201cI don\u2019t mind, I figured that me and Peggy would have to pay for some of the wedding\u201d. I asked what he meant. He said no way would they be able to do their wedding in under $10k. I said My own wedding, after haggling and deals, only came out to around $7k so I do not think this is an issue. He argued against me and said that my wedding was 40 years ago and prices were different. He outlined some prices and said the cheapest venue he could find was $5k, and food alone was going to be $2,5k.\n\nHe again said he didn\u2019t mind and he thanked me for giving them money for the wedding but I honestly felt hurt that he thought we were not giving enough. I said how could food come out to 2500 dollars and he said that that was only around $25 per person. I suggested ordering pizzas or sub sandwiches but he looked at me like I was crazy. I said okay well we can just offer less for the photographer and decorator and he said that isn\u2019t how things are done. I said it is how things are done, and maybe if Peggy and him weren\u2019t so spoiled and expecting the best of the best for everything then $10k would be plenty.\n\nAfter I said this he just closed his eyes and thanked me for the money and basically told me to get out. I was complaining about this instance to my wife and she told me I was being a stick in the mud and it\u2019s his only wedding. My friends agree with me though.

You don't get to decide how much their wedding should cost, you only get to decide how much you want to contribute.\n\nSecond, did you serve pizza and subs at your wedding? If the cultural aspect of paying is so important to you, what are the other cultural traditions of this wedding, and would your family and friends been good with pizza when you got married? By the way, I'm down with pizza for a wedding, but  you being very invested in one part of the cultural tradition of a wedding while thinking going cheap on other major parts is..interesting.\n\nThird, no you don't get to just pay vendors less.\n\nAnd finally, do you really not realize that stuff costs more than 20 years ago? Your wedding cost $7k, and let's say it was 24 years ago (your son is 23, so I'm going with you had your son after you were married). Just by using the general US inflation calculator, $7k in the year 1999 would cost $13k in the current year. And that's inflation, not buying power. If you go by buying power, it is easily over $20k to get the same thing you got for $7k decades ago.  That's such basic comprehension that things cost more than 24 years ago, I can't believe you can't apply common sense to this conversation.", "Yes, YTA. He thanked you for the money and is planning on paying for the rest. How they spend their money isn't your business. Can you seriously not envision that prices have increased over several decades?", "YTA Your son was incredibly gracious but you had to keep pushing, he even thanked you.  \n\nDo you pay the same price for gas, food, clothes etc like 40 years ago ?   \n\nDo u live under a rock.", "YTA and so wildly out of touch. You evidently have no idea how things work now.  It\u2019s the mentality of my grandparents, which is understandable as they are in their 90\u2019s. You really have no excuse. \n\nWas your wedding also a pizza party?", "YTA\n\nI googled a quick inflation calculator. $7000 in 1980 equates to just under $26,000 today. So actually your son is talking about a wedding that's cheaper than yours.\n\nIn other words: This is like you being asked to plan your wedding back in the 80s for less than $2800.", "YTA. An average wedding these days is about $25k, depending on where you live. Your son and future DIL aren\u2019t spoiled; they handled this gracefully by making it clear they don\u2019t mind paying for some of the wedding themselves and thanking you multiple times for contributing. You calling them spoiled was out of line and you should apologize.", "YTA\n\nDude, I too am 57 and know things from back then.  Yes things were cheaper then BUT do you really think 10k today can buy what 10k bought 40 years ago?  Obviously you have a job and saved money so it is inconceivable that you would try to compare 40 year ago prices to todays. (In fact adjusted for inflation since 1983 your $7500 would be today's $22,975   https://www.usinflationcalculator.com) Your son thanked you and was appreciative (your projecting that he felt you were not giving enough was because you knew you were being cheap compared to your future in-law) and communicated what he was going to do to make up the difference and you pulled the I remember when it was a nickel when I was young line?!!!!  \n\nGet a hold of your time, try not to be that old dude and stop talking with the those friends who either have not gotten the whole story or are too old to remember that Pinball is not the biggest game at the Arcade.", "YTA. He was respectful and thankful. Explained why 10K would not go far for a wedding at today's prices. Your response was to suggest pizza and subs (at a wedding FFS) and insult him and his fiance. Your son is a far better man than you.", "Are you also one of the people who acts shocked that students can't pay for a college education outright with their wages from a summer job flipping burgers?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Not for deciding that all you want to give was 5k. That's fine.\n\nYTA for not believing (with inflation) that a wedding could cost 20k just because yours cost 7k FORTY years ago. And then to keep questioning him like he was lying. Why don't you get a quote for a basic wedding from a wedding coordinator? You'll be shocked that throughing a wedding for 10k is on the cheaper side, cutting a ton of corners.\n\nHe said thanks, he appreciates it, and will put his own money in. End of.", "YTA.   \nHe literally thanked you for what you gave and said he was prepared to pay the rest to meet the standards of HIS wedding. He wasn't asking you to cut costs for him. And he's right, prices aren't the same. Could he do a budget wedding for under 10k? probably. But that's not what he and his fianc\u00e9 want, and if they can afford the difference they are entitled to make it so. You had your ego hurt.", "YTA, he didn\u2019t complain, he was grateful for what you gave AND he was prepared to pay himself for whatever they needed beside what you gave. The only one who sounds spoiled in this story is you asking that they have a pizza party instead of a wedding..", "YTA. 10k is barely a bare bones wedding anymore. Also, your son was having a conversation with you. He doesn't seem to have been bitching that you didn't give enough, he just said it wouldn't cover everything and that he was prepared to make up the difference. He is right, you really don't know how things work anymore.", "INFO: they\u2019re prepared to pay, he thanked you for helping\u2026where\u2019s the spoiled part?", "YTA. For a \u201cnice\u201d wedding (and I don\u2019t mean extravagant) it is roughly $25k these days. You are very out of touch with how much inflation has affected the cost of a wedding.", "YTA...If culture dictates that you and the other father should split the cost, and your son points out how much things cost, you should reflect on that.  They are not being spoiled, you are being stingy.  You don't ask someone to order pizzas and subs for their wedding dinner.  Even after all of this, your son had the decency to thank you for your contribution.  If nothing else, you raised a decent person.", "YTA.  I mean, there was a new study that even a casual weekday lunch averages $15.  \n\n$10k is not enough for a car, down payment for a house or a wedding anymore.", "YTA.  \"Welcome to my son's wedding!  Help yourself to a sub from Subway's five dollar footlong section\"  Then step out to the rest of the strip mall, where we will be cutting the sheet cake from Costco later!

Those stains on the hem don't even show, do they honey!  My son is wearing his suit from graduation, doesn't he look great?! I told you letting down the hem of those pants would work out.  Please be careful of those bouquets, bridemaids.  I've keep the receipts and they are going back to Michaels tomorrow.\"\n\nThere is no doubt if they follow your advice, it will be a talked about event.  But not in a good way.", "YTA\n\nHow are they acting spoiled ? Son thanked you for the money and just explained how things cost more now.. your 57- have you not noticed inflation creeping up on literally every single thing with a dollar amount over the years ? really ?", "YTA.  It\u2019s fine that you are offering $5K but you\u2019re in the wrong about how much weddings cost, and being defensive and rude about it.  If he\u2019s trying to have a lower-mid-level event with a rented space, dress, cake, photographer, officiant, flowers, invitations, and maybe music, it\u2019s not going to come in under $10K.", "YTA: Put whatever you want up for this wedding, but don't pretend your son is spoiled because things cost more than they did 40 years ago. That's deluded.", "Let's put this in terms of vehicle costs. A  Chevy Silverado 2-door short bed work truck sold for new at just over $10,000 in 1983. That same truck now (work truck, nothing fancy) brand new in 2023 has an MSRP of just over $40,000.\n\nIf a truck/house/groceries cost 4x what they did 40 years ago, why wouldn't a wedding cost that much more?\n\nYou don't have to give him more, but you could admit you have no idea what things cost now. YTA.", "100% YTA. Your son responded gracefully and you are totally out of touch with how much things cost. \n\nI got married last fall. The venue was on my wife's aunt's property that she did not charge us for. The food was done by my parent's close friend who only charged me the cost of the food and the servers he hired. The DJ was a friend of FIL. We limited the guest list to 100 people. The wedding still cost us $10K", "YTA - \n\nThis is like the time I asked my dad how much milk costs\u2026 \n\nHomie, our salaries haven\u2019t changed but the price of goods and services DEFINITELY has and they have all gone up. The whole \u201cbang for your buck\u201d thing went out the window in the 90\u2019s. That\u2019s gonna be $15 for a small pewpew. Your kidneys will give you that bang tho. \n\nYour son wasn\u2019t trying to hurt your feelings or make you feel inadequate - he\u2019s probably just *really* tired of the whole \u201cback in my day\u201d spiel that we all get repetitively from your generation when it has literally no application in our current world. \n\nIf I could have lived as an adult when you got married, I\u2019d be so much happier.

Now I\u2019m paying $50 \ud83e\udd72", "A quick google search for an inflation calculator states that $7000 40 years ago has the same buying power as $25000 now. YTA for calling your son spoiled. Pizza or club sandwiches for a wedding? Lol. Lmao.", "I\u2019m saying YTA.\n\nYour son did not once complain about the amount based on his personal preferences. It sounds like he did his research of what the anticipated costs would be and quoted the cheapest that he was able to find to you. He thanked you for the help and even said that he didn\u2019t mind that it wasn\u2019t enough Eve cause he had already anticipated needing to pay some part of the expenses. \n\nThat is not him being spoiled.", "YTA. 40 years ago you could also raise a family on one income and buy a 4 bedroom, 2 bath house for 35k. Get with the program, grandpa, times have changed and not for the better when it come to money.", "YTA, inflation is a thing and the cost of goods and services go up. Your son was being very nice saying thank you for the money and not asking for more. You\u2019re upset because you want to be. You offended your son and his fianc\u00e9e for no reason. They are not entitled or spoiled. They\u2019re realistic. You need to do some research on wedding costs because you\u2019re way off base.", "YTA and are completely clueless about inflation", "YTA.   You spent $7K of your parents' money when you got married 40 years ago.  That would be about $25K today.  $10K today would have been $2.8K when you got married.  You are being a hypocrite.   You got the best of everything when you got married at your parents' expense, but you expect your son and his fiancee to pay for over half the wedding to get an equivalent celebration.", "Oh boy, having just planned a wedding,  this hits home. YTA, but I think anyone would be blown away by how expensive weddings can be if you\u2019re going the typical route. \n\nYour son was very gracious and absolutely right, $10,000 will likely not cover it, but it\u2019s still generous of you to help with the cost at any level.", "Oh my god\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 just\u2026 Yes. Yes, YTA.", "YTA things do cost more now and most businesses don't haggle, they aren't a flea market. Plus your son was respectful and thanked you for helping pay, didn't ask for more, so you called them spoiled.", "YTA - Before you spoke to your son, perhaps you should have done some research on the costs of weddings - in fact the cost of anything today. While $5000 would be a nice gift (and your son seemed appreciative), it would not cover 50% of wedding costs in most venues. Hell my son and fiancee are paying for their own wedding, and I'm giving more than that as a gift, and so is my ex.", "YTA.  Weddings are expensive.  He wasn't complaining,  he was thanking you and sharing he will be contributing as well.  You can order pizzas for your wedding, but they may want something nicer,  that's not being spoiled.  Negotiating your photographer and other vendors is fine to an extent but most vendors know their worth and aren't going to take kindly to being told you don't agree with the industry standards of their worth.  \n\nIt's perfectly fine and kind of you to give anything as I don't think parents are obligated to pay anything, but you don't get to dictate how their wedding goes, it's none of your business.", "YTA. The average cost of a wedding right now is $29,000 where I live, I\u2019m trying to plan my own wedding right now. The cost of everything has gone up. He\u2019s not being spoiled, he responded graciously. You pushed the issue.", "YTA - weddings are much more expensive now than they were 40 years ago.  I got married 2 years ago and spent about $14k.  That was with a new venue that was giving big discounts, no special transportation, big discounts on the DJ by picking a certain photographer, catering for about 60 people, and open beer/wine instead of an open bar.  That includes the flowers, the cake, the officiant, the photographer, dress and tux.  But I did a LOT on my own to save costs.  \n\nYour son's wedding will easily be $15-20K, especially if they're expecting around 100 people.  You need to stop making terrible suggestions like \"hire a cheaper photographer\" or \"order pizza for your wedding reception\" because those will just cause your son to cut you out of the process.  Your son is trying to be gracious and thank you for what you've agreed to give them.  Why are you continuing to argue with him about it??\n\nThey are not spoiled by wanting to have a nice wedding.  Rather, **you are being cheap and petty because you are ignorant about wedding planning and uneducated about what a wedding costs.**  Yes, it's a huge amount of money for one day.  You need to get on board with this because you'll ruin a lot of relationships with a lot of people if you don't.  You've already made a good start with your insults to your son and his fianc\u00e9e.", "YTA. How could they be spoiled if they are willing to help pay part themselves?  You have no sense of reality if you think a $7000 wedding 40 years ago would only be $10000 now unless you don't count for current inflationary terms and rising cost of goods.  It's time you step into the 21st century and step up for your son.  If not I hope you don't really want to ever see your grandchildren.  His wife will never forget this slap in the face.", "YTA. He said thank you and that he and his bride would pay for the rest. That\u2019s\u2026 the opposite of spoiled. He\u2019s not spoiled at all. You\u2019re being controlling and miserly and your son still said thank you and that he would pick up the slack. There\u2019s zero wrong with your son\u2019s position. You are basing your expectations for HIS wedding in 2023 on YOUR wedding 40 years ago. \n\nAre you\u2026. Crazy?", "YTA why tf are you complaining? He thanked you and was grateful for the money you provided. That is not being spoiled. Being spoiled would be throwing a temper tantrum and uninviting you from the wedding unless you paid more. \n\nI'm currently planning my wedding (with no contributions from family) and while I am doing a lot of things myself and have friends helping out as much they can, my budget is already well over $20k. Weddings are expensive now and there is no way you can compare the cost of your wedding 40 years ago to a wedding now.\n\nYou sound entitled.", "Info: Is this wedding in the US?", "INFO: where was your venue 40 years ago? How many people came? What did you serve for food? Was there an open bar?\n\nNot saying that an expensive wedding is owed or necessary, but if your culture suggests you are expected to cover half, and the standards of what that means aligns with YOUR wedding 40 years back, it's pretty hypocritical to pinch pennies and try to lock prices as hilariously outdated by any national measure.", "YTA.  Pizza and subs? Cheap out on the photographer? \n\nI know you don't have to give them money and your son did thank you but it sound  liike he knows what you're like. \n\nAnd yes, things are a lot different than when you had your wedding 40 years ago.", "YTA I\u2019m so tired of you older people just ignoring how expensive everything is now. Good for you that you could have your wedding for pocket change prices but that\u2019s not how it works anymore lmao", "Yta obviously. You are well on your way to get low contact with your son and have a bad relationship with your dil. Good luck", "YTA", "I have a hard time believing this post is real because OP is so delusional from what he says in comments \ud83d\ude05\nYTA and if they have additional funds to pay for the kind of wedding they want withoud taking out a loan, it\u2019s none of your business. Also her father offered 10k not to spoil her but because he made a realistic estimate of costs. In the end, different people value different things in their life.

People can't afford to lowball themselves not to mention prices HAVE risen worldwide exponentially.", "YTA \n\nUnless we\u2019re missing something, nothing he said came across as spoiled.

Not only did he thank you for what you contributed, but he also planned to pay for his wedding himself.  In what reality does that make him spoiled.\n\nYou are just throwing a temper tantrum because your son proved that the brides father was correct and you are wrong.  Real mature to resort to name calling.  Your son must get his patience, grace, and understanding from his mother.", "YTA. The average wedding cost in my area is $26,000. This is the midwest. Any further east or west and that number goes up. It\u2019s not the 80s anymore", "YTA! He has no problem paying for the excess, so what is the problem? You're the one that's being a spoiled brat, expecting his wedding to go to your specifications. 10k for a wedding is nothing nowadays. Most venues cost that much. Stop trying to force your son to do things your way. It's not about you.", "YTA\n\nWhy are you so hurt over this? He graciously accepted your gift and said he was going to cover the rest, no problem. What is this a problem? The part he covers is his own money to spend.\n\nAnd yes, the way you are explaining how your wedding went down isn't how it's done nowadays. Of course, you could go with a DIY wedding at home or a park or something and save costs. But not everyone wants to do that. It sounds like he wants a wedding at a venue, that is catered, etc. Also, subs and pizza at a wedding is also not the norm. Weddings are typically a dress up, formal affair. The average price of a wedding in the US is around $30,000. Having a wedding for $10k is definitely possible, but not if you want the 'traditional' experience with a venue, catering, photographer, flowers, etc. The photographer and flowers ALONE could cost almost $10k and that's not even the 'best of the best'. I want to also mention that $25 a head for food is an AMAZING deal. Most of the time it's more like $150-$250 a head. $25 a head means there are around 100 people going. How much do you think pizza and subs for 100 would cost (including drinks)? Probably not that much less!\n\nLastly, as some has mentioned, you were married 40 years ago for $7000. Inflation would bring that up to like $25,000 today, which is right around the average price for a wedding in the US today. Things HAVE gotten WAY more expensive. Even in the last 10 years! My sister's wedding was about 10 years ago and some things cost me almost double what it cost her. \n\nIt's your son's wedding and he is going to cover the cost of whatever he wants over the $10k gift. If he wanted you to cover all of it, that would be a different matter. But you're definitely sounding like a 'back in my day, we did it like this! Youngins these days are spoiled and don't know the worth of a dollar!' type of person. Don't be that.", "Ok, Boomer\n\nYTA. Never have those two words been more appropriate. Yes, I know your age isn\u2019t quite boomer, but your out of touchness to reality makes you one for sure.", "YTA. 10k 30 years ago and 10k now are completely different. He didn\u2019t even ask you for more money, he thanked you for helping and decided to handle the rest himself. You called him spoiled for taking matters into his own hands. That\u2019s actually the exact opposite of being spoiled. If he was spoiled he\u2019d be on here asking if he\u2019s the asshole for telling you that you need to pay up more.

The DJ and photographer were $1500 together from the same company for off season pricing. We invited the bare minimum of people that we could get away with.

Other than that (and the Canadian geese but long story lol) it was perfect. And super inexpensive! Hotel cost like $100/night, forgot what the license cost, we bought discount donuts to build our wedding cake so that wasn\u2019t much, maybe $100 on cannabis including a special joint and edibles (which was technically recreational since we were from out of state but I use it to keep seizures and stomach stuff and all that under control), $50 on some special local beer to toast ourselves and bring home with us, and ribs for dinner which were also a discount from the grocery store but we had leftover ribs when we got engaged so it was kind of perfect.
