He finally concedes and walks down to the secondary bathroom down the hall to use the toilet. Afterwards, he commented that I am really weird. The entire time I thought he walked into my master bathroom against my wishes and acted as if he was going to piss in my toilet just to joke around but I am thinking now that he really thought it was okay to ignore the homeowner's request even though there was a secondary clean and functional  bathroom available for use.
