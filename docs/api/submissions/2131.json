NTA", "The only time it was okay for me to go walk into my friends master bedroom to go to the bathroom in their toilet is because their house was a little odd in the layout. It had half of the downstairs underground and the living room was \"upstairs\" next to the kitchen and their bedroom, the \"downstairs\" had the 2 other rooms and the second bathroom. It just made more sense if we were hanging out in the living room to use their bathroom, but only after THEY suggested it.\n\n That being said, NTA. You didn't give him permission and he straight up ignored you. That's so fucking weird.", "NTA all the way. What kind of guest ignores the host's requests and why the fuck couldn't he use the regular bathroom? Your friend is weird.", "NTA, that\u2019s why you have a \u201cguest bathroom\u201d \n\nI ensure the guest bathroom is clean before guests come over, the master I don\u2019t because I don\u2019t expect people to use it.

But I'd ask your friend if he has a hearing problem.", "NTA\n\nWhy would his first instinct be to go into the master anyways. I hate going into peoples bedrooms especially if we're not close.

Is this a fucking joke?\n\nThats a good ass laugh.\n\nOp not the AH", "You need new friends. \n\nNTA", "\"Please use the bathroom down the hall\" is not an unreasonable request. Acting like he's gonna whip it out and piss right in front of you in the bathroom you specifically told him not to use?? THAT is weird.

You don\u2019t just walk into someone\u2019s private space", "NTA\n\nNo one needs to be in my bedroom ever. Off limits don't even question it. And I will afford you the same courtesy in your home.

Why do you even need to ask?", "NTA", "..NTA\n\nYour friend is rude.  Why not use the bathroom down the hall?  Why walk through another person's bedroom to that bathroom.\n\nThat's weird.  your friend is weird", "NTA, honestly after this display, he would no longer be allowed to be a guest in my house. Like that was very pointed that he was ignoring you and was going to straight up piss in your bathroom in front of you despite your protest. It is not weird for you to have a boundary but it is incredibly weird for him to go out of his way to violate it", "NTA", "NTA!! \n\nOur master ensuite is accessible via the laundry and is closer to the living areas. My dad kept making a beeline for our bathroom when he was over - even though we\"d told him numerous times where the main /guest bathroom was and to use that. Refused to listen. Once he even used the master bathroom while we were out and he was babysitting our kids along with my mum...and I had left clothes allll over the bathroom. Not impressed, kinda creeped out. \nFrom then on I started locking the damn door every time he comes over. It's the only thing that works.", "NTA\n\nYour friend's behaviour freaks me out.", "NTA.

Do no let him back over again.", "NTA - wonder if he wanted to look through your personal items in that bathroom or bedroom\u2026", "INFO, does he have to enter your bedroom to get to the master bathroom? Does he have to go through another room to get to the secondary bathroom?", "ESH . He sucks, but also you literally threatened to kill him?

Then someone like this guy wants to feel special or assert dominance or whatever goes through the minds of rude people and I remember not everyone has manners. \n\nI won\u2019t even go into someone\u2019s bedroom unless they say it is okay. It\u2019s private.", "I can\u2019t agree with OP being odd if the master bathroom in question wouldn\u2019t be an en-suite. The master bathroom is where I don\u2019t expect guests so that\u2019s where you could find panties soaking to get the period stains out or my freshly hand washed delicates hanging to dry. I\u2019m not obligated to have my entire home ready for guests to just walk into. It\u2019s that principle for me.", "I think the refusal to listen part is the most important detail here.", "Entrance to master bathroom is through the master bedroom. The secondary bathroom is standalone and is near the front door.", "You took that seriously? Really?", "Its a hyperbole, jesus.", "Oh, so you let people disrespect you at your own home?", "Or in the master bedroom.  What would be have done if he hadn't been followed?  That's a likely place to find small valuables or money.", "THIS - lol. YUP.  Though, if he's a close friend it might be worth asking WTF he was thinking... Just for the sake of curiosity. NTA", "^^^ this\nBecause OP describes it as the \u201cmaster\u201d a guarantee it\u2019s en-suite. But as was just described, your personal bathroom has all the stuff you DONT want guests to see - which is totally normal", "I don't get emotionally invested to the point of tying my ego to a room in a building where people shit lmao", "Op did mention they had to walk through their bedroom to get to the bathroom.", "In a random building perhaps, in their own home after being told no? Nope.", "Yall are weird lol", "Dont kid us, pal. No one in their right mind would be ok with a guest disrespecting them at their home.", "Dude if you wanna get mad over a thing you shit in then go ahead lol"]}
