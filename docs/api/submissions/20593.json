I have three daughters 15 and 16 and 24, and a son, 23. The youngest two have been going to local summer concerts and festivals here. They have bought some festival wear for those including corset tops and skirts. I am fine with the corset tops for festivals, concerts, going out with friends. A few of the corset tops look like lingerie. Which again, I am fine with normally. \n\nYesterday was my MILs mass (a year since she passed). My husband and I go to church every week, other than that I don\u2019t leave the house. We are friendly with the priest and a few of the people there. My only friends are at church. We left early leaving the kids to get ready on their own. The kids don\u2019t normally come to mass, but it was important to my husband as it was a memorial mass. \n\nMy youngest was going to another music festival that same night and our 16 year old had joked was she going to go in her pink corset top and concert wear. My youngest said \u201cObviously not I\u2019ll go home and change first.\u201d The 16 year old was laughing when she said this so obviously knew it wasn\u2019t appropriate attire and it was a joke. \n\nI was very happy to see them all arrive at church. The 16 year old gets out of the car in a white skirt (which was very short but stylish and would have been fine if it had another top) and a white lace corset top. The top is see through in between the boning. It literally looks like something out of a lingerie shop. I won\u2019t get into other details but it was very small. I know these are the style these days, but just not for church. \n\nAdmittedly, I was really embarrassed. I went up to her and whispered \u201cYou can\u2019t wear that here. What were you thinking?\u201d She insisted she was wearing and equivalent amount of clothes to her younger sister. I told her firstly, that wasn\u2019t true, but secondly, the problem was that the corset looked like lingerie and the style is just not ok for church. I told her since she made the joke earlier that she knew it was wrong and doing this was a big \u201cF*** you\u201d to me. She was defiant and said there was nothing wrong with it. I told her to sit in the back of the car and sent her sister home to get her a sweater. \n\nA few people from church saw her and our priest. I told her it was really embarrassing she had shown up to church like that. She was then rude to all my friends and came inside with an attitude. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should have just let her come in and said nothing. It was literally clubwear. She feels like I \u201cslut shamed\u201d her but I told her I was happy with the outfit and even the amount of clothes, but it was the fact it looks like underwear that embarrassed me. I don\u2019t want to be that type of Mom, but I also think there has to be limits sometimes. \n\nAm I the a-hole?", "created_utc": 1687715678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14isi3m/aita_for_making_my_daughter_put_on_more_clothes/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You let her express herself all the time with her clothing choices. It was definitely inappropriate to wear to a memorial mass.

She knows that's not appropriate attire for a church, let alone a memorial mass.", "Of course NTA. There are dress codes for everything. Things you can\u2019t wear at work, church, etc. You seem like a pretty open parent allowing your kids to wear what they want but there is a limit.", "NTA. Her outfit was completely inappropriate for the setting and she's old enough to understand that.", "NTA \n\nThere is a time and a place, and 16 is old enough to be held accountable for appropriate choices. Learning to adjust her appearance and behavior for the time and place is a real skill she will need to function as an adult. It\u2019s not like this is some arbitrary line in the sand. \n\nIt is not slut shaming to insist that she dress respectfully in a place of worship. And I say that as an atheist. You don\u2019t enter a place of spiritual significance with disrespect regardless of how your believes align with that spiritual group. It\u2019s not about her body and how much she does or does not want to show. It is about showing respect. People\u2019s religious leanings aren\u2019t her problem out in the world in general, but when you enter someone\u2019s place of worship, it is a completely fair expectation that you will behave respectfully within the bounds of that religious group.", "I was fully expecting you to be TA here but, holy shit, what was she thinking? I don\u2019t know about your denomination or anything, but most churches in my area (if not all, honestly) won\u2019t even let you in with your shoulders uncovered! And to do this for a service on honor of her grandma\u2019s?\n\nListen, I\u2019m not one to care for religion and/or restrictions around clothing, but this is just plain disrespectful.\n\nNow, she\u2019s 16 and probably didn\u2019t think it through, so she doesn\u2019t deserve nuclear punishment or anything, but I would have a talk with her about respect. Try to see if you can make her understand that you\u2019re all for her dressing in a way that makes her feel confident but there are boundaries that should be respected.\n\nEdit cause I forgot: Op, you\u2019re NTA", "NTA  \n\n\nYou stated that you're fine with such attire for other instances just not for church. I also don't think you slut shamed her. There was an expectation there that they clearly understood but she decided to disregard it", "NTA. There is different attire for different events in this world. She wouldnt go to her festival dressed in a full length gown would she? Or a funeral in a bikini?  Just because she may not be aware of this doesn't excuse it. Some places in the world she'd be beaten on the spot or worse.", "NTA. I saw something in a church one time that said \"You would'nt want to wear your church clothes to the beach, don't wear your swimsuit to church.\"  I saw the pic you posted and that is really not appropriate for church but I could definitely see it at a festival.", "NTA. There is a time and place for certain dresswear. Church is one of those and outside of that you let them wear what they want freely. \nOne day she'll look back on this and have a laugh at how silly she was acting but for now she is a teenager.", "NTA. It's not like you demand they attend mass every Sunday in long skirts with no bare arms. It's one freaking mass for her grandmother's memory, she couldn't just wear a skirt and short sleeve shirt? She will(hopefully) be so embarrassed by her actions in the future. I was raised Catholic, and have some religious trauma, as I am bi, and had a rough time coming out. But Jesus Christ, if we were visiting my parents, and my dad asked me to come to a mass in memory of my grandmother, I would suck it up, wear something appropriate, and be there for my dad, and remember my grandmother fondly", "nta, some things just aren\u2019t appropriate for the occasion, this is one of those things. you seem to be very lenient with their clothing choices in general, much more than i would be if i had a daughter. you handled it well.", "NTA.\n\nShe is your underage daughter living under your roof. It's your rules. \n\nPeople dress up conservatively for church. It's the cultural norm if you like it or not.", "She knows that's not appropriate attire for a church, let alone a memorial mass.", "NTA. There are basic social norms and dress codes that have nothing to do with shame and everything to do with the venue. No one sane would wear a bikini to a five star restaurant. No one sane would wear a ballgown to go swimming at the beach. Club wear is not the same as church wear. Maybe your daughter thought she was testing a boundary, but what she did was ultimately disrespectful to you and the memory of her grandmother. If anything she owes you an apology for bad judgment.", "Regardless of whether or not you believe in a specific religion or don't believe in any religion at all...it is disrespectful to behave or dress in a manner that is disrespectful to the church community you are choosing to worship with.\n\nWhat your daughter did was immature and disrespectful.  And more than that, you have shown her a lot of trust by allowing her to express herself as she see's fit.  And she took that trust and threw it back in your face by making a  very immature decision. \n\nAnd yes, there should be consequences.  In my house growing up, my mom trusted me to take care of myself, not get stupid, not get arrested, not get in trouble for drinking or causing problems.  And when I threw that trust back in her face, there was a price to pay\n\n\nThere is a time and a place for everything and this was neither the time nor the place for this act of rebellion\n\nThough I imagine this was more of a manipulation.\n\nNow she thinks you will just let her skip going to church all together\n\nNTA", "NTA.

You sound like you\u2019re more than fair with how she dresses and she should return the favor when necessarily", "NTA I know some people may not agree but there is a time and place to wear certain clothing. That fit sounds vastly inappropriate for church or even some family events. I let me kids wear what they want to an extent. I\u2019m an elder millennial and I pressed a lot boundaries. So I get it. But nope not at church.", "NTA. She has to learn that she has to dress appropriately for the location, type of event etc.", "NTA. There's a time and place for everything.

There are clothing expectations for most events.  You\u2019re more understanding of their clothing choices than I would be.", "I just wore an outfit like that today to brunch lol. NTA. She knew the whole deal! Time and place are a real thing and she should learn that how you dress is coded language in and of itself. She was being disrespectful to you and to other parishioners.", "NTA and you are way more welcoming to her attire than my mom would\u2019ve been when I was 16. It is also really sad she is using the term \u201cslut shamed\u201d as she is a minor.", "NTA. I\u2019m all for encouraging kids to feel confident in their clothes, but there are still some places where certain dress etiquette is a factor. That was the case here.\n\nYou didn\u2019t shame the outside itself or \u201cpunish\u201d her for it, you expressed that it wasn\u2019t the right time or place for it.", "NTA she's 16, she should know better", "NTA. I know people like to abuse the line come as you are as it pertains to church (that verse was regarding poor people who felt they didn't have clothes good enough to attend service), but there is actually, in my opinion clothes appropriate for church and clothes not appropriate for church.

Your daughter was being willfully obtuse.", "Nta, dress for the situation or don't come.  I wear different clothing at work or at the bar.

Would she wear a bathing suit to a wedding for example?", "[deleted]", "NTA. \n\nThere are places you can wear what you want and places where you need to respect the experiences and beliefs of everyone else who is sharing that space. \n\nDaughter needs to learn the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.", "NTA. Tell her it's a Catholic Church, slut shaming is kind of their whole deal.", "How come you don\u2019t leave your house?", "If I may ask, why do you not leave the house other than for church?", "NTA I guess because it seems like she did it on purpose, but church is of course the AH for making people feel embarrassed for how they dress in the first place.  Not how Jesus would have done it!", "Totally agree.  Your clothes speak for you.  They send a subtle message to those watching.

However, definitionally, telling girls they're misbehaving for not covering up more of their body *is* slut-shaming. It sounds like you and your daughter have different values around this. It sounds like you are Catholic and from what I understand the Catholic church also has different values around women showing their bodies.\n\nEdit: It might be good to ask yourself: why do I find it embarrassing that my daughter's body was visible in this context?

I'm so sorry.", "I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.", "Yeah, I get that!", "*She would be just as inappropriately dressed if she wore baggy jeans and a long sleeved band tee*\n\nThere's plenty of churches that would not blink an eye at that.   \n\n/a progressive Christian", "Yes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Did you read the part where she was only asked to go one day this year?\" .. and she was not ASKED; she was forced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: You still are the AH. For focing them to go to mass. Jsut because YOU believe in one or another religion does not mean they have to. And: You might want to pretend you are not controlling their clothes, but you ARE.", "See through right out of a \"lingerie\" shop?  Isn't that erotic underwear?   On your daughter?  Calling it lingerie makes it daily wear then?\n\nFirst, like most kids.  She has no style.  Probably too much makeup also.  \n\nChurch has a theme.  Being stylish in the theme is doable.  Clubbing has a theme too, i.e. a bit more risqu\u00e9.  You can still be stylish at the club.  \n\nI could give a class on style.  Uuuggghhh.  And I'm not even gay!!!", "You, like most mom's need to learn the subtle art of shaming.  \n\nI was not being sarcastic.", "Thank you. You really have summed up how I feel in the words I couldn\u2019t. They\u2019re just clothes. I don\u2019t attach any meaning to them. I don\u2019t think clothes label her as anything. I just didn\u2019t think this one outfit was appropriate for church. I did try to explain it to her but I\u2019m not sure the message is getting received that way.", "\"I don't force them to go to church, but here's a story about me forcing them to go to church!\"", "Why not let her skip church? Being forced to go to church sucks.", "Thank you. It\u2019s a very hard line to walk. I\u2019m just trying every day not to permanently damage them.", "Thank you. This is what I was trying to get across to her. Maybe I will try to explain again later using your examples. I really wasn\u2019t trying to shame her clothing just the timing and occasion for it was wrong.", "Thank you. It\u2019s been rough. I am seeing a counsellor about it and trying to get better.", "Thanks. I am ok but I am stilling missing a few teeth and embarrassed to go out, plus scared to go out. So that\u2019s why I only go to church.", "Unless the deceased or their family specifically requests casual attire, etiquette dictates that people dress a certain way for funerals, whether religious or secular. It's best for the girl to learn this now instead of humiliating herself as an adult by dressing inappropriately for an occasion.", "I disagree she was forced. Her father asked her to attend for her grandmothers memorial mass. She did not say she didn\u2019t want to go, and she didn\u2019t complain. She chose to go as her father asked her. \n\nI was controlling in this instance yes, but I don\u2019t believe other than this one instance I have ever commented on their clothes. I give them a good amount of money to spend on clothes and they purchase whatever they like on their own.", "My mom was an expert at shaming, amongst many other things. Both parents were horrible people in many different ways. My parenting up until this point was just to do the opposite of what they\u2019ve done and it\u2019s worked out well until yesterday. There obviously has to be some lines though. I find it hard putting boundaries for teenagers because they need them but I don\u2019t want to be like my parents. The difference is my mother would shame me for things I had no control over and very minor mistakes. It\u2019s very hard for me to know what\u2019s normal. My role models for parenting were very poor.", "Honey, I have 5 girls and 1 FTM that was raised as a girl bc he didn\u2019t start his transition until he was just about 18. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to see your kids wearing stuff that you don\u2019t particularly like but know that it\u2019s just a difference in taste and a different generation. I get your feelings on it. I do what you do- just keep my opinions to myself and let my kids wear whatever they want. \n\nBut to add into it teaching them the appropriate times and places for different outfits- there\u2019s definitely some missteps. \n\nAND THEN add into it that not being able to wear what you want wherever isn\u2019t actually policing their bodies or slut shaming them but actually just a part of living in society\u2026 it\u2019s a lot. \n\nYou\u2019re a good mama. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with trauma now, too. If you think it\u2019ll help, maybe the girls need some therapy to help them, too? It has to be SO scary for teenage girls to see that act of violence against their *mama* of all ppl. Our moms are part of our identity, too. Maybe she\u2019s acting out in a way that only makes sense to her subconscious. Maybe not but it might be worth a few sessions to see. \n\nAll my love to you and your precious girls. They\u2019ll get there and you\u2019ll survive it. ;)", "We asked them to go to church once a year. If she refused it would have hurt my husband\u2019s feeling but we wouldn\u2019t force her. It was a request from my husband to all the kids. He doesn\u2019t ask them for much so they probably felt obliged but they weren\u2019t forced. The only place we have ever forced them to go is school and the doctor.", "I let her skip church every week except for one a year. It\u2019s her grandmothers anniversary of her death and it means a lot to my husband to honor her and pray for her.", "did you even read the post?", "one day at a time, mama", "It definitely will take some time and don't be harsh on yourself, it's the little steps that count. You're doing beautifully. You sound like an amazing ma to be honest, and that there is somewhere else \"safe\" for you (your church and parish) is great too.", "Did I make a judgement on the OP's child?  No\n  I simply said jeans and t-shirts are fine at some churches.", "So you are very good at guilting them.", "My bad.  I see you're struggling.  \n\nYeah you probably needed some better role models.  \n\nTry something like ... sweetheart that looks really nice but that style isnt appropriate for church.  You can still be you at chuch dear but church requires a different type of sophistication.  \n\nWhat would help is if she saw you walking the talk.  Up your game a little and be her role model.  \n\nI make a point of never being out of shape nor out of style.  You dont have to be J Lo.  Just minor tweaks.  For her to listen, she must believe that you're probably right.", "Lolllll.   Typical parent.  I'm not ridiculing you.  Many new parents do the opposite of their parents.  That's how we got the shit show called the 60's.", "Thanks very much! I really appreciate your kind words and I will try to get them into therapy too.", "I mean, I get why you'd want them to cover up while there. The Catholic Church is famous for its ... uh... \"love\" of children. \n\nThe point being, surely there's a secular way to honor their grandmother's memory?", "I don\u2019t think so. We talk a lot about the Catholic Church and the issues with it. We disagree with a lot the church does and discuss it with the kids as well. We allow them to make their own decisions except for attending school and the doctors, which are mandatory. If I was good at guilting them, I doubt she would have worn that to church. She is probably better at guilting me than me guilting her to be honest. As I am here feeling guilty and she is fine.", "I used to be stylish and keep up with fashion until last year when I was attacked outside my house. I lost several teeth in the attack which still haven\u2019t been replaced so I don\u2019t feel very stylish. I have stopped leaving the house, except to go to church because I\u2019m embarrassed by how I look.", "Yes, I think my parents were much worse than other parents though. I\u2019m not talking religious fruitcake parents. An example of shaming in my house would be me getting shamed for being sexually abused by a relative at 4. As if I asked for it somehow. That was a running theme in my early childhood.", "Yes we also had a family dinner after (which she didn\u2019t attend for different reasons which I understand.) I didn\u2019t have the younger two attend the funeral because I felt they were too young and it would not be good for them. So my husband asked that they go to the anniversary mass. We aren\u2019t a super religious family and we don\u2019t agree with a lot of things the church has done. If she chose not to attend in protest of the Catholic Church, I honestly believe both of us would have understood. We have family discussions about this all the time.", "Yeah: You sound very democratic as long as they do what you want. And when they don't - like in this case - the heavy hand comes out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo they likely KNEW it weas easier on them to give in while dad was still asking.", "Can I ask you how you think what I did in this case was heavy handed? I told her to sit in the car until a new shirt arrived and then she went into church. Do you think people can wear anything anywhere? Should people be allowed to wear a bikini to the library?", "\"I told her to sit in the car until a new shirt arrived\" this is it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Should people be allowed to wear a bikini to the library?\" .. this was not a bikini.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the real reason is: Should people be allowed to be AHs to their kids and not expect to be called out for it when asked?", "Did you see the picture of the corset I posted? It is see through and lace. I feel wearing it to church is much like wearing a bikini to the library. I am happy to be called out but it didn\u2019t seem like you\u2019ve read the post. I more expected to be called out for saying she was embarrassing me. Not for asking her to attend mass one day out of the year for her grandmother. Your original post suggested I always force them to go to mass, which I don\u2019t.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m not religious but I attended churches as a kid and there\u2019s such a thing as CHURCH CLOTHES for a reason. Heck, even when I attended a Pentecostal church, if I didn\u2019t wear a skirt, I still wore fancy dress pants and appropriate shirt.\n\nETA: condolences on your MIL.", "NTA. I\u2019d let her know just how inappropriate she was being. By dressing in an intentionally provocative way, she not only disrespected the location (as many people genuinely find church deeply important and sacred), she also disrespected her family by doing this during a memorial for a passed loved one.", "You \"think\" there has to be limits \"sometimes?\" There have to be limits all the time with kids, they can't be allowed to do whatever they want all the time. It sounds like they do though, if your kid thought it was okay to wear a super short skirt and a see through top to church. Seems like the 15 year old is wearing the same kinds of things, and going clubbing at her age? It's alot easier to let them do whatever they want though, rather than imposing age appropriate limits.", "NTA. She knew better than to wear that to church. She intentionally did that to embarrass you. The fact that it was a memorial mass for your MIL makes this even worse. You\u2019ll need to have a serious conversation and find out the root of this behavior.", "Nta I also was the kid to always push boundaries with what clothes I would wear but it\u2019s super disrespectful to wear a party/festival outfit especially lingerie to a memorial service.", "NTA. She was not dressed appropriately for a memorial mass. She needs to learn time and place. Why not put on a blouse or sweater over the corset top that she can easily remove later to go to the festival? Why not wear a blouse underneath the corset top, if she wants it to be visible? She was intentionally trying to antagonize you. I have a corset top in black similar to what your daughter has (also purchased for a concert) and have worn it over other tops or beneath other shirts when going to class to make it a more appropriate outfit.\n\nShe needs to learn how to style the clothes she owns in a way that is respectful and appropriate for various settings and levels of formality. I'd recommend you show her some more modest outfits that she can wear to church and school that will still represent her personal sense of style.", "YTA\n\nyou could have \"punished\" her afterwards by no longer taking her to church tho I suspect she might be happy about that.\n\nbut shaming her is a worse mistake than showing up in clubwear to a church, especially since dess code is bullshit anyway\n\nyou daughter may be on to something\n\nshouldn't good christians accept people no matter what they wear? if you think differently please remind me when jesus said they should hide their skin when drinking my blood or eating me out?", "Yta for indoctrinating your child into a cult that promotes conspiracies and dumbs down critical thinking.", "NTA.... A part of parenting is teaching about how to choose clothing for different situations. (Job interviews, weddings, funerals, school, travelling in different countries...vs parts and beaches ....) This is just learning about basic manners and consideration for other. This of course is in balance with your own comfort. The key word being BALANCE.", "Wearing a see through top makes her feel confident?", "Of course she is certain she is right. All teens think that. But you are the parent, and you don't have to be super strict to not let them run wild.", "Maybe read some books to get other input on parenting issues? You really think it is okay for her to wear see through lingerie for clothes?", "If that doesn\u2019t work then you can buy yourself a festival outfit and wear it the next time you\u2019re in public with her. I suspect she\u2019ll quickly discover she understands that there\u2019s a time and place for different dress.", "That is truly my bad. Sometimes Freedom of Expression can be really taken advantaged of. Your daughter is in the wrong. Frankly I just realized that it is really fucked up that she's using the anniversary of her grandma's death to challenge the church."]}
