You should not live with your mom or sister.   They are financially and socially leeching off of you.  Your sister should do more than help with door dash.

Not cooking, cleaning, providing care to speak of, unless there are things you don\u2019t mention. \n\nAlso, you need help with night terrors. A healthy adult can sleep alone, even when they prefer to have company.   Maybe a fried would be a better roommate that your family.  I do wonder if there is a relationship between night terrors and all the family garbage that makes it so you are supporting the other adults.   \n\nYou deserve healthy relationships and a therapist might be a good idea.  \n\nRegardless, you mom has no moral, legal, financial or social authority over you.
