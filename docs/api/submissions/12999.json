In this case, you planned to take your date out to dinner, presumably at whatever passes for a nice restaurant in the \"rural hell\" you say you live in. You should dress for the occasion.\n\nTypically, on a date you should aim to dress a notch or two better than typical for the place you're going. I can't think of a restaurant dinner occasion where I would go lower than a shirt and slacks for a date - particularly a first date, and particularly when the dinner was the focus of the date. It's about making a bit of an effort for your date, to show them that you value them and the time you're spending together.\n\nSure - if your plan was a nice walk in the country together, then jeans and a sweatshirt would work, and you could grab dinner afterwards. But that's not what this was.\n\nThat said, if you are a casual person who doesn't want to \"dress up\" for occasions, then this wasn't the person for you, because she is obviously someone who likes dressing up and \"making an effort\". So I think I'm going with NAH, and just realize that you two weren't suited.", "YTA\n\nYou don't suggest to a woman what she should wear. You don't suggest to anyone what they should wear, actually, unless they ask for your input.", "NTA. It\u2019s actually good of you to communicate your expectations about the date beforehand and avoid the awkwardness of her showing up in a ball gown. While it may be common to put forth a bit of effort in your appearance for a date, it\u2019s in no way trashy to want to be comfortable when meeting someone for the first time. \n\nIt sounds like you dodged a bullet, TBH. If wanting to wear a sweatshirt and jeans on a night out is trashy, I wonder what other facets of rural living your date would find unacceptable.", "As long as the plan is clear, there's no need to bring up a dress code. Women will dress the way they want. Your comment made it sound like you weren't all that interested in her. Whoops, NAH.", "Everyone is different. Personally, I think jeans, and t-shirt is great. If that's what you're comfortable with, just keep looking until you find someone who matches that. \n\nNTA", "NTA \nShe sounds high maintenance", "\"Your outfit reflects the importance *you* assign to the event\" as someone told me once. \n\nNAH.

There are other girls who would love your casual attitude though.", "NTA her reaction was problematic, why insult and block you everything because of that lol", "NTA, find someone you can be yourself with. If I was talking to a girl and she blocked me for this, i'd consider it a nuclear missle dodged.  Trying to show a significant other's parents respect by dressing up a bit is very different than suggesting a more casual first date. Honestly i think I've dressed up once for a date at all and it made me feel like i was going to middle school prom and looked ridiculous. Some people like that, and maybe down the road a SO would want that occasionally and that's a fair ask if it makes them happy, but on a first date, it's silly, you don't even know eachother yet.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, I remember almost going on a date with a girl that explained to me the day before over text that I would have to meet her parents first (we were about 20) and hold all doors for her. (the excuse was \"southern charm\" but bro this was a coffee date) I promptly cancelled the date.", "I would have appreciated this from you.

If I'm getting into a relationship whether with my partner or my partner's family I want to get into it as me, not as some dressed up refined version of me that isn't going to last past the first meeting. \n\nBe your authentic self. You'll find the right person/family/friends/whatever.", "NTA\n\nShe definitely overreacted by calling you trashy. So I'd guess you dodged a bullet. She was likely expecting to get a nice meal out of it, and dressing casually  suggested you were cheap to her. \n\nUnfortunatly in general, the suggestion \"Lets just dress casually \" on a first date/meetup is going to sound like you are going to be a bit lax in the self care/hygiene area. A first date (especially  with a stranger) is basically the same as a job interview, and if you clearly didn't try and look a little nicer than usual, your date is likely to take it that you didn't think she was important  enough to bother with. \n\nSome girls are ok with that and will let it slide, but it's  still going to stick in their minds as a strike against you. In my experience, people who don't  try to dress nice and impress a bit on the first date, definitely  don't  try after afterwards, and quickly devolve into poor hygiene and very cheap dates. That may not be how you are, but its common enough that it is what you might convey.\n\n First date, suggest where you want to go, and dress appropriately but maybe a step  above what you would normally wear. I.e, leave the jeans and tshirt home unless you're  meeting on a hayride. Even then, wear nice jeans and a higher class of t-shirt, lol. Let the date decide, based on the venue how casual shes going to be. So say you don't  want to dress like you're going to a fancy restaurant or nightclub, just suggest meeting at a coffeehouse or casual restaurant, where more formal dress would be frowned on.", "Light YTA - it would have been better to ask if she would like to dress casual or would she appreciate a nicer dressed date instead of suggesting it.

I say slight, because I really don\u2019t think you had any intent on making her feel bad or really trying to control how she dressed. \n\nBut, for the future she knew the plans as you stated so she could pick her outfit and I assume she wouldn\u2019t have gone in a dress and some stilettos to dinner and a movie.", "If you are looking for people that give so much importance to dressing and so little importance to manners and kindness, then yes, you should dress more formal next time.\n\nOtherwise, as others said: you dodged a bullet.\n\nNTA", "YTA - you're basically saying she isn't worth the effort. You jumped to the 3 months dating date right off the hop.", "Calling you trashy and blocking you would seems to indicate a certain volatility in personality to me as don't think suggesting casual is really enough to warrant that much of a reaction. Someone who was interested and able to communicate would have just told you they had expected something different. Perhaps you may have been a bit naive but definitely not an AH for suggesting.

Don\u2019t tell your dates how to dress.", "NAH, I\u2019m all for a casual date. Girl was probably expecting something big.

She really overreacted", "ESH\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d block someone for it, but I wouldn\u2019t like it. If someone showed up in jeans and a sweater in a way that looked nice and put together, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d think twice.

And announcing that you intend to not try very hard is where the ahole part comes in.\n\nI don't think you need to dress formally, nice jeans and a nice non Iron Maiden shirt would likely be fine. But unless she asks specifically for dress guidance or you're going to a place she's not familiar with and she could use a heads up on the atmosphere, you shouldnt inform her how to dress.  \n\nThere's a big difference between dressing up formally and dressing like you want to look good for your date.\n\nShe is also the ahole cause she overreacted.

Because it's not like it's a surprise date where she wouldn't know what to wear and you need to say \"don't dress up\" or \"wear something nice\". She knows it is dinner and a movie, so she would dress accordingly and expect you to do the same. Someone saying \"let's do casual\" to a casual date would make me think you plan on rocking up in sweats or PJ bottoms, which is a bit trashy for a first date.

If someone tells me casual,I\u2019ll be rocking my jeans,some sort of pullover and my Vans or Chucks.", "Super disagree. Casual means jeans and a flannel to me, and that totally makes sense because for a first date with someone youve never met there should be lower expectations on spending and investment. No one thinks pjs for casual come on", "As a 22 YO, I see nothing wrong w sneakers to a movie and dinner date. If your white converse, or air forces go with your outfit, then they just do. I\u2019d rather a clean, nice outfit than loafers with a hoodie. I\u2019ve also been to a date recently where this guy wore a sweatshirt but he styled it well, imo he looked pretty great for a first date but also walking around afterwards or hanging out with your friends.", "Yeah. Where he went wrong is saying anything about how to dress. Even if she asked how she should dress based on what they were going to do, he could have just said \u201cwe are going to a movie\u201d and left her to decide on her own how she wanted to dress. He likely came off as apathetic, which turned her off.", "Seriously. A basic button up shirt untucked is not high effort or fancy, but it\u2019s a million times better than a hoodie on a first date", "This!!!", "OP would have been entirely free to not dress up regardless. If he felt good about what he\u2019s wearing, he\u2019d feel no need to coordinate the dresscode or to have his outfit choice validated. \n\ndressing casual for a date is 1000% fine (as is dressing fancy, to each their own), but telling someone else how to dress for you comes across as controlling and insecure.", "This is my thought. The right person will respond with \u201cthat\u2019s awesome!\u201d If that\u2019s what\u2019s important to you.", "Nothing wrong with dressing casual on a date. The weird bit to me is him suggesting to her how to dress, I don't even do that with my girl friends. If he was worried about them turning up in mismatched attire he could have just said what he was planning to wear", "I agree. And I'd be insulted and put off by someone who didn't think I could dress appropriately for the planned locations. I'm sure she knows how to dress herself.", "Hard disagree. On the first date with my current wife, we had the setting expectations conversation. Agreed to go casual and bam, love of my life is now my wife.  Communication is key. If someone is just gonna shut down a conversation, it ain't gonna work. Bullet dodged.", "I disagree, I love movie dates. You meet up before the movie, chat on your way in and while you're waiting for the movie to start, the pre-show might give you stuff to talk about, and then you watch, and then go out for dinner, or maybe just drinks or a quick bite, and talk about the movie.\n\nBut it's ultimately a personal preference thing. Some people really want to keep the conversation going through the whole date and some people appreciate an hour or two where there's no pressure to talk, but then having something to spark the conversation after.", "Right, I'd make an assumption that a man who said this was trying to weed out seemingly \"high-maintenance\" dates who dress nicely and \"cost more\".", "\u201cTo be or not to be dressed casually\u201d is not the issue at hand though.

Soft YTA for the phrasing", "Even if you prefer casual, you wouldn't find it weird for a guy to tell you what to wear before you've even met?", "I think she basically thought you were saying that you were just going to sleep together, so no need to dress up as it's just a glorified hook up.\n\nalso, why? let her dress up if she wants/dress how she wants.. this just sets the standards SO LOW that most women will see this as a guy who's too lazy to care.", "Oof yeah OP you told her you wanted to keep the relationship casual lol", "Oh my sweet summer child. That doesn't say 'let's dress casual' that says 'let's have casual sex but not get emotionally involved'", ">\"hey btw no need to dress up or anything, we can just keep it casual if you want.\"\n\nThis comment comes off as very... immature.

It will never be easier to stop talking to someone than when you've never met them before. Especially once a date is arranged, guys tend to think they've got it \"in the bag\" and loosen up a bit when means showing their ass.", "I think it really depends on the person. \n\nMy friend's version of business casual when I invited her as my +1 for a work christmas party was throwing on a knee length shawl/cardigan thing over her pajamas. It was embarrassing to say the least. She also showed up an hour late, hadn't brushed her hair, and ignored everyone and everything except food.    \n(We're not friends anymore, this was one of many things) \n\nOn the flip side, my ex would put on a nice, pressed dress shirt every time we went out (unless we'd been out four wheeling or something right before)", "As Poofter says, it's already a somewhat casual date, depending on the restaurant. People are going to dress appropriately. Saying to someone that you want to dress casual to an already casual date explains that your definition of casual is an even lower caliber than everyone else's definition of casual. \n\n\nIt's the same as if OP had said \"let's dress nicely\" - he's saying that his definition of dressing well is a higher caliber than most people's. \n\n\nGenerally speaking, clothing signifies effort. The reason we don't show up to most weddings and funerals in jeans is out of respect for the event. The reason most people don't show up in a sweatshirt to a dinner date is out of respect of the event. \n\n\nI'm not criticizing OP by the way. I'd say NAH, they just have differing opinions on how much effort you should put into a date.", "It does to me, as well. But I learned it means other things to people when a dude showed up to a first date in gym shorts, white socks, and shower slides on.", "In fairness, I *do* wear pajamas virtually everywhere most of the time. I only dress up for occasions that specifically call for a higher standard of dress, like a dinner party or a classier date. Casual is comfortable, CMV.", "Exactly. Assuming she is similar age to him, most young women know how to dress themselves given the information of where they are going. It isn't about being casual or not casual. It's about assuming she isn't smart enough to put her own outfit together for dinner and a movie.", "Yeah, if he'd just showed up wearing what he wanted to wear it might not have been a problem. My husband wore jeans, a t-shirt, and a hoodie on our first date and it didn't register with me as an issue, but I might've felt put off if he'd called attention to it or told me ahead of time.\n\nThat said, you can wear what you wanna wear, people are gonna feel the way they're gonna feel about it.", "Wait so, making sure both people are on the same page with expectations is wrong? Screw me and my ADHD/anxiety brain I guess. It should be normalized to have that discussion about expectations instead of having to guess/read minds.", "Hell, an unbuttoned flannel shirt over a clean, unwrinkled, plain t-shirt is better than a sweatshirt.", "I feel bad for him, I'm totally on team Iron Maiden shirt.", "The fact that everyone in this thread - and OP\u2019s brother, too, - is reacting only to the question \u201cis it OK to dress casual on a date\u201d shows me they\u2019ve really not understood what ticked this woman off. \n\n*The question isn\u2019t \u201ccasual or nah?\u201d It\u2019s \u201cdid I F up by telling my date how (not) to dress\u201d.*\n\nLike\u2026 smiling is great, but if anyone other than a photographer TELLS me to smile, I\u2019ll get mad, and not because I hate smiling but because i hate being told what to do!", "Casual to me when going out is a nice pair of jeans & shirt or jumper & decent shoes.

You might want to consider buying a sweater or two so that you have something to wear to casual events where you still would like to look put together.
