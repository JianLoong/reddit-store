In this case, you planned to take your date out to dinner, presumably at whatever passes for a nice restaurant in the \"rural hell\" you say you live in. You should dress for the occasion.\n\nTypically, on a date you should aim to dress a notch or two better than typical for the place you're going. I can't think of a restaurant dinner occasion where I would go lower than a shirt and slacks for a date - particularly a first date, and particularly when the dinner was the focus of the date. It's about making a bit of an effort for your date, to show them that you value them and the time you're spending together.\n\nSure - if your plan was a nice walk in the country together, then jeans and a sweatshirt would work, and you could grab dinner afterwards. But that's not what this was.\n\nThat said, if you are a casual person who doesn't want to \"dress up\" for occasions, then this wasn't the person for you, because she is obviously someone who likes dressing up and \"making an effort\". So I think I'm going with NAH, and just realize that you two weren't suited.", "YTA\n\nYou don't suggest to a woman what she should wear. You don't suggest to anyone what they should wear, actually, unless they ask for your input.", "NTA. It\u2019s actually good of you to communicate your expectations about the date beforehand and avoid the awkwardness of her showing up in a ball gown. While it may be common to put forth a bit of effort in your appearance for a date, it\u2019s in no way trashy to want to be comfortable when meeting someone for the first time. \n\nIt sounds like you dodged a bullet, TBH. If wanting to wear a sweatshirt and jeans on a night out is trashy, I wonder what other facets of rural living your date would find unacceptable.", "As long as the plan is clear, there's no need to bring up a dress code. Women will dress the way they want. Your comment made it sound like you weren't all that interested in her. Whoops, NAH.", "Everyone is different. Personally, I think jeans, and t-shirt is great. If that's what you're comfortable with, just keep looking until you find someone who matches that. \n\nNTA", "NTA \nShe sounds high maintenance", "\"Your outfit reflects the importance you assign to the event\" as someone told me once. \n\nNAH.

There are other girls who would love your casual attitude though.", "NTA her reaction was problematic, why insult and block you everything because of that lol", "NTA, find someone you can be yourself with. If I was talking to a girl and she blocked me for this, i'd consider it a nuclear missle dodged.  Trying to show a significant other's parents respect by dressing up a bit is very different than suggesting a more casual first date. Honestly i think I've dressed up once for a date at all and it made me feel like i was going to middle school prom and looked ridiculous. Some people like that, and maybe down the road a SO would want that occasionally and that's a fair ask if it makes them happy, but on a first date, it's silly, you don't even know eachother yet.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, I remember almost going on a date with a girl that explained to me the day before over text that I would have to meet her parents first (we were about 20) and hold all doors for her. (the excuse was \"southern charm\" but bro this was a coffee date) I promptly cancelled the date.", "I would have appreciated this from you.

If I'm getting into a relationship whether with my partner or my partner's family I want to get into it as me, not as some dressed up refined version of me that isn't going to last past the first meeting. \n\nBe your authentic self. You'll find the right person/family/friends/whatever.", "NTA\n\nShe definitely overreacted by calling you trashy. So I'd guess you dodged a bullet. She was likely expecting to get a nice meal out of it, and dressing casually  suggested you were cheap to her. \n\nUnfortunatly in general, the suggestion \"Lets just dress casually \" on a first date/meetup is going to sound like you are going to be a bit lax in the self care/hygiene area. A first date (especially  with a stranger) is basically the same as a job interview, and if you clearly didn't try and look a little nicer than usual, your date is likely to take it that you didn't think she was important  enough to bother with. \n\nSome girls are ok with that and will let it slide, but it's  still going to stick in their minds as a strike against you. In my experience, people who don't  try to dress nice and impress a bit on the first date, definitely  don't  try after afterwards, and quickly devolve into poor hygiene and very cheap dates. That may not be how you are, but its common enough that it is what you might convey.\n\n First date, suggest where you want to go, and dress appropriately but maybe a step  above what you would normally wear. I.e, leave the jeans and tshirt home unless you're  meeting on a hayride. Even then, wear nice jeans and a higher class of t-shirt, lol. Let the date decide, based on the venue how casual shes going to be. So say you don't  want to dress like you're going to a fancy restaurant or nightclub, just suggest meeting at a coffeehouse or casual restaurant, where more formal dress would be frowned on.", "Light YTA - it would have been better to ask if she would like to dress casual or would she appreciate a nicer dressed date instead of suggesting it.

I say slight, because I really don\u2019t think you had any intent on making her feel bad or really trying to control how she dressed. \n\nBut, for the future she knew the plans as you stated so she could pick her outfit and I assume she wouldn\u2019t have gone in a dress and some stilettos to dinner and a movie.", "If you are looking for people that give so much importance to dressing and so little importance to manners and kindness, then yes, you should dress more formal next time.\n\nOtherwise, as others said: you dodged a bullet.\n\nNTA", "YTA - you're basically saying she isn't worth the effort. You jumped to the 3 months dating date right off the hop.", "Calling you trashy and blocking you would seems to indicate a certain volatility in personality to me as don't think suggesting casual is really enough to warrant that much of a reaction. Someone who was interested and able to communicate would have just told you they had expected something different. Perhaps you may have been a bit naive but definitely not an AH for suggesting.

Don\u2019t tell your dates how to dress.", "NAH, I\u2019m all for a casual date. Girl was probably expecting something big.

She really overreacted", "ESH\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d block someone for it, but I wouldn\u2019t like it. If someone showed up in jeans and a sweater in a way that looked nice and put together, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d think twice. But saying it up front communicates that you aren\u2019t willing to go to any effort and aren\u2019t taking the date seriously.", "ESH, but you not for wanting to dress casual, but for bringing up dress at all \n\nIt's just kind of weird because if she knows where you are going, she can figure out how to dress. And announcing that you intend to not try very hard is where the ahole part comes in.\n\nI don't think you need to dress formally, nice jeans and a nice non Iron Maiden shirt would likely be fine. But unless she asks specifically for dress guidance or you're going to a place she's not familiar with and she could use a heads up on the atmosphere, you shouldnt inform her how to dress.  \n\nThere's a big difference between dressing up formally and dressing like you want to look good for your date.\n\nShe is also the ahole cause she overreacted.

Because it's not like it's a surprise date where she wouldn't know what to wear and you need to say \"don't dress up\" or \"wear something nice\". She knows it is dinner and a movie, so she would dress accordingly and expect you to do the same. Someone saying \"let's do casual\" to a casual date would make me think you plan on rocking up in sweats or PJ bottoms, which is a bit trashy for a first date.

Do you have an arcade close by?", "Maybe but better than sweatshirt.", "That's just wasting time. I did the \"young kid wanting to make a good impression\" phase, then the \"I'm gonna dress up nice to make a good impression\" phase. Eventually, you're gonna drop that and be you. Just be you from the beginning. \n\nI'm not saying you should show up to a wedding or funeral or job interview in pajamas, just that you should be yourself in normal circumstances such as \"dinner and a movie\". \n\nJust be you from the beginning and you'll save yourself from being in a relationship cultivated on \"pretend\" for years. If they're not about you, or vice versa, then you both win because you don't waste time only to find out you're not compatible later.", "Which I don't think is asking much. I'm also 29 and he's 20 so a bit of a generational difference", "This is what I am thinking! Because I have never gone on a first date where I'd need to dress up - I am FAR more comfortable in a scenario where I can wear jeans and a tee shirt, and I am not a girl who enjoys a dress, so therefore dressing casually to me is not a big deal at all (and honestly I always assume a dress code is casual unless stated otherwise lol).  \n\n\nBUT the way it's worded does make it seems like you want to keep the date and the relationship in general casual, honestly!", "My ex-husband and I saw \u201cBowling for Columbine\u201d on our first date.", "Funny enough I do know multiple that would.", "\u270b\ud83c\udffbfirst date with my fianc\u00e9 was the fucking joker movie and I had a great time. Speak for yourself\n\nEdit: LMAO you\u2019re the same person that hinted OP was trying to force his date to dress casual", "Yeah sure. If putting on a collared shirt is some terrible violation of being your authentic self then don\u2019t do it. Probably best to let your date know right away that you\u2019re a stubborn weirdo who is obsessed with trying to be different and unique. But if you\u2019re a normal person who can deal with putting on a nice shirt for an evening, I\u2019m still gonna recommend that you do that. You\u2019re probably gonna get more second dates.", "And the first dates will end up being more genuine because you'll both be being yourselves. I don't want a second date with someone trying to impress me, I want a second date with someone that is comfortable with themselves.", "Then you do that. I genuinely didn\u2019t know that there were grown adults who felt that wearing a nice shirt was some terrible betrayal of their personal identity so I\u2019m sorry for offending that demographic. But still, my advice to a young person who is more interested in building relationships and being part of society than they are in being a special little snowflake, is to buy a nice pair of pants, and a couple nice shirts and wear them when you\u2019re first meeting someone you want to make a good impression on."]}
