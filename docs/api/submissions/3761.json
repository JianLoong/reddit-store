I ensured him that I was just trying to make sure that she didn't get hit by a car, but he started getting agitated and told me to stay out of other people's buisness.

If the adult's behavior is both illegal (and in several places it is illegal to walk/run in the middle of a street) and inconveniencing other people then it's acceptable to say something.
