I usually see the same woman running as I'm leaving my neighborhood. She only ever wears black clothing to run, and she runs in the middle of the street (the sidewalks are icy this time of  year). She's extremely hard to see with the dark clothing, and I was worried that it was only a matter of time before someone hit her because she's impossible to see. Yesterday she ran across the street while I was waiting at a stop sign, and I realized that it was one of my neighbors who lives across the street from me. I wanted to say something right then but didn't want to freak her out, so I decided to write a note and put it in her mailbox when I got home basically saying that I've noticed that she's very hard to see when she wears black to run, and that she should maybe consider wearing lighter colors or something reflective so she doesn't get hit. Her boyfriend knocked on my door later in the evening and told me that I crossed a boundary, and that I was \"acting like a stalker\". I ensured him that I was just trying to make sure that she didn't get hit by a car, but he started getting agitated and told me to stay out of other people's buisness. It was not my intention at all to freak her out, and now I'm wondering if I really did cross a boundary.", "created_utc": 1669989777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zan3n9/aita_for_telling_my_neighbor_that_she_shouldnt/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or at least attempt to, THEN leave a note explaining that you\u2019re sorry you missed her but you were just stopping by because you were concerned for her safety because you almost didn\u2019t see her and are concerned other people might not pay as good of attention while driving.

I can absolutely see why a woman would feel creeped out by that note in her mailbox. I know you had good intentions but she doesn't know you or that, for all she knows you're watching or following her when she jogs. \n\nAt the same time, your point about her clothing is totally valid and absolutely a safety issue. Hopefully, she still takes the advice to heart and wears something more visible.

Mind your own fucking business.\n\nYTA\n\nEDIT: It's wild that in 2022 there are as many NTAs here. This guy is watching this woman run enough that he has clocked her regular apparel, knows her address, followers her on her route in his car enough to know where she is running relative to the street for the full duration. Maybe where you live that's fine in rural small townia or affluent suburbia, in my city that's step one for getting assaulted.", "NAH. You sound like a very compassionate and kind person who genuinely cares about the safety and well-being of others, and your heart was in the right place. But women who run are victims of crime far too often, and I can also see how getting an unsolicited note from a (I'm guess a male?) neighbor commenting on her outfit would come across as creepy. Regardless, hopefully she will consider wearing clothes that are less likely to get her injured.", "NTA.  Next time you see this woman apologize about leaving the note in the mailbox and say you were just concerned about driving and not seeing her but didn\u2019t mean to upset her or her boyfriend.

We all weigh personal risks differently.", "NTA. In most places there are actual laws about this.

She's a grown up and can make her own decisions as to what she wants to wear while running, and where she wants to run, even if those choices lead to her being less safe than possible. Or are you in favor of people leaving notes when they see their neighbors (i) failing to wear seatbelts, (ii) failing to signal at a stop sign, (iii) smoking, (iv) eating fast food, or (v) a plethora of other activities that are unsafe? Not even Sheldon Cooper would go so far.", "Sheldon Cooper would have absolutely told his neighbor she needs to wear reflective clothing.", "Oh so you're that kind of person. This situation is not even comparable with the things you said. She has nothing to do in the middle of the road and especially at this time at the day with dark clothes it could end in a very bad expercience for both of them and other people.", "Yes its her choice\n\nBut if someone does run her over they are likely to be traumatised and therapy for the rest if thier lives, especially if she dies. They might even find themselves prosecuted (depending on county/laws). Why should someone elses life be ruined because she didn't take two seconds to put on something reflective before going for a run in the dark?", ">She's a grown up and can make her own decisions\n\nNO ONE said otherwise. That isn't the problem. \n\nOp said she is HARD to see- dropped a mail and the woman felt stalked because of it. NOT because of if she was sexy in her cloth. The woman might not have known about that safety issue. \n\nShe is hard to see. \nShe felt stalked\nBoth are safety issues. \n\nNo one said she should not be naked if she wants to. \nOp is a good neighbour and I hope the woman (re)considers her clothing choice for her own SAFETY.", "When her choices affect other people, yes you should say something. She is putting the drivers in her neighborhood in a place where they are likely to not see her and possibly injure or kill her. Even assuming they are heartless and would not be emotionally affected, their insurance rates would be. Their car would likely be damaged. \n\nPeople in a car with someone not wearing a seatbelt do get to make a comment to that person because if the car is in an accident, that person's body becomes a projectile likely to kill other passengers. If they didn't stop at a stop sign, they are also putting other drivers (and possibly pedestrians/bikes too) in danger, so yeah fair to say something. If someone is smoking and you literally can't leave the situation (like they try to smoke in your house), that affects your health and you get to say something.\n\nAlso, leaving notes is like the lowest stakes thing ever. She can literally just ignore it if she wants to. It's not like OP called the cops.", "Assuming that he would, who wants to model themselves on Sheldon Cooper?\n\n:-)", "The kind of person who minds his own business and assumes that other adults are able to make a decision as to what to wear?

Have a good day.", ">not to wear dark clothing after dark\n\nMany are reasons anyone can wear a dark cloth after dark. \n\nYou are making an assumption that the neighbour knows. Maybe she doesn't? Maybe she thinks the few cars that pass aren't a big deal? Maybe she expects that the cars should see her? Maybe she thinks she is the exception to the safety concern. \n\nNow she knows. She can keep doing whatever she wants. \n\nOp did what they should do", "LOL.", "Well, that's asshole behavior.", "LOL. I understand the situation quite well, thx."]}
