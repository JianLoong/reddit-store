No need to do all either, just do sports safely.", "I'd hit her next time", "NTA. My son and I got caught out in the dark on our bikes a couple weeks ago (had to stop to look at cats many times \ud83d\ude02). We had some reflectors but not nearly enough. It was dark for us to see far ahead of us safely and I knew we were two black shadows to drivers. So we moved cautiously and this resulted in looong waits at crossings.

I wonder how it was worded, maybe the neighbor decided to send her bf cause she felt frightened", "So you're ok with being an accident waiting to happen instead which is just as dangerous??

My only gripe with the person one is that when you are running in an area with zero other light sources, it's difficult to see in front of you due to the brightness of the lights you wear.

Why would someone choose to run in the middle of the street in an urban environment? Even the quiet streets have cars nearly round the clock.
