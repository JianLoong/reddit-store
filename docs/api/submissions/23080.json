This included my best friend (21f) and her boyfriend. Alongside 20 other people. I have these kinds of pics on my social media, it\u2019s not uncommon of me. I\u2019m very body positive and advocate for everyone to be comfortable in their own skin. After I made the post my best friend since pre-school, suddenly ghosted me and went really weird. We speak every single day and she started ignoring me, not answering my calls and would make excuses to not hang out. She struggles with her mental health and I was worried she was going through an episode and needed help. I gave her space but also kept telling her I am here for her. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until almost a month later she sent me a message stating that she has been MIA because of the picture I posted and that \u201cit doesn\u2019t sit right\u201d with her that her boyfriend saw it. She then also stated that I sent her a tik tok that made her uncomfortable and that she\u2019s unsure she wants to be around me anymore. For context, I am bisexual but am in a long term relationship with a male. As our friendship has been for almost 18 years we are very comfortable with one another and something we do is make jokingly flirty comments. The tik tok I sent her was a video of a lesbian couple and my message was \u201cthis could be us but you love dick too much \ud83e\udee6\u201d which was no different to the out of pocket shit she sends me also. \n\nI was absolutely heartbroken, I felt so betrayed that she thought I had any ill intent about my picture and her boyfriend. She met her boyfriend on valorant and he lives in a different state. She flew to his state after talking for 1 week and began dating. At this point they were maybe dating for a month and a half. I figured maybe she\u2019s struggling with insecurities and trust issues as it\u2019s a fresh relationship but to then be uncomfortable by me for a tik tok when we have always been like that and she is like that with her other girl friends also. I responded to her message asking for context and apologising for making her uncomfortable and that it was not my intention. I then asked why she had a sudden issue with our flirty jokes and she said she wasn\u2019t sure. I asked if it had anything to do with my sexuality and she said no she just felt weird about it. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to others about the situation and they think she\u2019s insecure and slut shaming/being homophobic. I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s that harsh but I am really hurt. She\u2019s completely out of my life now but she sent me a message another month later saying that she didn\u2019t mean to drive a wedge between us. My response was along the lines of \u201cwhat you said really hurt me, at the moment I am not in the right headspace to speak about it but maybe another day we can catch up and voice our sides and work through this\u201d she left me on read and we\u2019ve not spoken since.\nAm I in the wrong?\nEDIT:\nAm I not allowed to post whatever I want to my own social media? It wasn\u2019t aimed at her boyfriend it was for myself. If she had an issue about it she could have spoken to me and her bf and arranged to delete me off social media if she didn\u2019t want her bf to see ass.\nTo add a different POV I have another friend who\u2019s bf was on the story and when I told her about this issue her response was \u201cidgaf if he sees your arse, I\u2019m not insecure and I trust him. It was just a photo\u201d", "created_utc": 1690258206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158x8my/aita_for_posted_a_booty_pic_that_my_best_friends/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is obviously going to create a lot of insecurities and it sounds like your friend is trying to rush and force herself into a relationship. When people do that there is a lot of insecurities going on in a lot of psychological shit.\n\nI realize you didn't directly send it to her boyfriend but this is kind of a read the room situation. He should not have been in your private friend group. He's not familiar enough and you guys don't know each other and she hasn't been dating him long enough for him to be seeing his girlfriend's best friend's booty. You also don't know any kind of conversation that may have gone on between them for that. For all you know he was staring at it for hours talking about how great it is while his girlfriend was 2 inches from him. So hopefully you take this as a lesson to really keep your private stuff private. You can post whatever the hell you want on your private pages but just be aware of who is going to be seeing it. It was obviously far far too soon to be adding somebody's boyfriend to a page where you show that kind of stuff.\n\nAs for your friend, she may need a little bit of therapy. Not because of you. She just sounds like she has some issues to work through. Hopefully she can become more secure and whatever is going on in her private life she can relax her anxiety about and you guys can repair your friendship.", "Hella boomers in here who dont know what snapchat is. NTA, you can post whatever you want to your story. BUT you need to be prepared to deal with the potential consequences, one of those being others insecurities.", "NAH but I do think it\u2019s a bit of an asshole move to send a friends bf you\u2019ve never met a pic of your butt (by adding him to close friends) Call me a part of the \u201csad generation\u201d or whatever OP labeled non gen z ers\u2026I think one day we are going to be looking at body positivity in the form of incessant selfies a little more critically.", "Ngl I kind of wonder if the issue isn't actually anything you did if this has never been an issue before even with this particular friend. You mentioned that the bf also follows your ig acct where you also post racy pics and I wonder if your friend thinks he finds you hot specifically.", "NAH. It\u2019s clear you guys aren\u2019t on the same page and that doesn\u2019t make either of you villains.", "This might just be me not getting how the specific website works, but why is your friend's six-week-boyfriend part of the 20-ish \"close friends\" who can see these pics?\nDid I get it right, that this relationship was only six weeks old when the oh-so-scandalous pic happened?", "Your friend isn\u2019t insecure. Insecure girls posts Booty pics for attention. Learn boundaries.", "YTA. \nAdding your best friend\u2019s out of state boyfriend of a little over month to your 20 person only private story where you post lewds/nudes is questionable at best.\nIt is expected that when you are in a relationship boundaries relating to communication and sexuality may change. Just because you used to joke flirt when she was single doesn\u2019t mean it is acceptable for her to joke flirt with you now that she is in a relationship. You crossed a boundary there and you didn\u2019t apologise for it. There\u2019s a general lack of respect and boundaries evident here through your actions, I don\u2019t think it makes you a bad person, it makes you young and clueless and that\u2019s fine but for the purposes of this post and story, I am afraid YTA.", "Can\u2019t decide on this one", "Nta my gf and I are thinking that she may be in some kind of denial and are thinking that she realized she like you more than originally thought. We could be very wrong however we are very high rn.", "NTA. You are just using the app for what it was created for. You two have been friends for a long time so she should be able to talk to you.", "YTA", "Post what you want but don\u2019t be shocked when there are consequences. Also I don\u2019t think it\u2019s insecure for your friend to be upset that her boyfriend received a pic of your ass. Personally I find it disrespectful. Side note: Body positivity and posting thirsty pics are 2 different things.", "YTA - like most have said, adding a boyfriend of a friend to a list that gets sexually suggestive images is going to cause issues.  It's also not ok to think someone is \"slut-shaming\" or \"homophobic\" to not want you to send thirst trap style photos to their significant other.  Just because your boundaries aren't the same as your friend's boundaries doesn't make hers wrong.  This was sent for the attention, otherwise why send it? People use body positivity as a reason to be able to send things that scream for attention on social media.  Secure people don't do need to do that.  Also, why would you not be more apologetic to a friend who gets upset about it?  Telling her that her feelings upset YOU turns the situation around on your friend and then makes it about your feelings, as if her naturally felt emotions (whether you agree with them or not) are wrong. They aren't wrong, they are her emotions.  She probably felt like you made this about you and invalidated her when she opened up about how it made her feel.  More empathy may have helped heal that relationship.", "Hesitant YTA\n\nThere's just so much that strikes me as strange to this story that I feel there has to be more to it. Ghosting such a long-term friendship over a single instance seems ridiculous.\n\nSending pictures like that to a group of 20 friends is also odd. (You do you, I just never saw the appeal of things like that. Attention maybe?) I can't help wondering if you're the only one or maybe one other person is doing it and the rest tolerate. \n\nThe lesbian joke I actually get, gay jokes between guy friends are pretty common at least with my boys. Again her sudden reaction makes it seem like there is more going on.\n\n\nAll in all, I want to go NAH but there's just too many things that rub me the wrong way. On the other hand, maybe she's being manipulated. I hate throwing out the predator theory but I mean.. a week of online game chat and suddenly she's flying out? Already mental issues and insecurities before all of this? Sudden behavior changes with no logical explanation? Has me worried.\n\nWhat we have here is a failure to communicate. You two are missing each other by miles it seems, I hope it gets worked out and that everything is alright.\n\n\n\nSeriously.. a week online and flying out? Flabbergasted. Especially a girl doing that. Dangerous.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with everyone here, it\u2019s like they didn\u2019t read the post or something. It\u2019s pretty obvious that your friend is just insecure. I\u2019ve been that person before in terms of feeling that way. She has every right to feel insecure, but to take it out on you was wrong.", "Light YTA. Why is her bf on your close friends anyway if he\u2019s in a different state? You seem like one of those weird girls ngl. Seen too many girls like you who aren\u2019t self aware. It\u2019s not an insecure thing bc I feel the same way as ur friend but I\u2019m def not insecure cuz I have a nice body. It\u2019s just more like an invitation for him to see your half naked body even tho it\u2019s \u201cnot ur intent\u201d\n\nI used to do the same thing when I was younger like 17-19. I would just be good friends with their boyfriends but it wasn\u2019t intended to be a thirst trap. However i realized it was weird to be posting such intimate photos ESPECIALLY on a close friends when I knew both the gf & bf. These are pics I would want my boyfriend to see only, because he\u2019s the only person I\u2019d give my body to. I use to think posting my body everywhere gave me confidence but when I limited it to one person, I feel more valued that way. I realized I was the insecure one & only posted my pics for validation. I mean, unless if I was an instagram model it would be different I guess. I\u2019m 22 also. Just something to think about. It\u2019s cool to post those cuz it\u2019s ur body but uh maybe just remove their boyfriends bc how close are you really to them?", "Light YTA. I agree that photos like that are no big deal but you also have to know your audience.\n\n<i>Am I not allowed to post whatever I want to my own social media? It wasn\u2019t aimed at her boyfriend it was for myself.</i>\n\nSocial media is by definition posting for other people to see it.\n\n*The tik tok I sent her was a video of a lesbian couple and my message was \u201cthis could be us but you love dick too much \ud83e\udee6\u201d which was no different to the out of pocket shit she sends me also.*\n\nShe seems to disagree but without knowing what the video was like and what she typically sends you, we can't really evaluate that.", "YTA. You sent an unsolicited nude (edit: lewd... thank God you were wearing underwear at least) to a group of people that included your best friend's boyfriend.\n\nImagine if a guy sent 20 people - including his bros' girlfriends - a snap of his dick while wearing speedos. And, when challenged on it, said that it was just him being \"body positive\".\n\nI don't know what's going through your friend's head but you might want to be sensitive to the fact that not everyone has the same view about the mental healthiness of sending lewds/nudes to friends and family and strangers on the internet.\n\nIn fact, and I'm gathering this might be a shocker, a lot of women get extremely uncomfortable with the idea that they have to \"compete\" for the male gaze with females who are more accepting of public nudity/lewdity. From a certain perspective, it's a challenge for her to get more nude/lewd than she's comfortable with so she can catch up.\n\nCan you understand how that's a little traumatizing? How this kind of puts her in a similar position as if a guy she was dating pressured her to get less clothed than she's comfortable with?", "ESH ? why was your friends boyfriend on your private snap story? that seems a little weird.", "I don\u2019t think either are truly TA. I think you both have your own perspectives. You absolutely have every right to post what you want, you\u2019re proud of your body and you should be! the only thing i feel weird about is that you made the private story, and added her boyfriend to it knowing that you post these kinds of things. Not everyone\u2019s spouse would be okay with that. I understand her insecurities are not your problem, but i also understand why she would feel uncomfortable. There was a lack of communication on both parts imo.\n\nI understand why you\u2019re hurt and saddened about her leaving your life as well as feeling betrayed, but a lot of people in relationships don\u2019t feel as \u201cidgaf\u201d as your other friend does. I also 100% believe that this is something she should have talked to you about as well as her boyfriend rather than cutting you off completely. I think it\u2019s just important to learn from this situation that not everyone is secure with their relationship, especially when it\u2019s a new relationship and in the honeymoon phase. That\u2019s when everything is the craziest. \n\nI hope you feel better soon and maybe find some other friends that will communicate better with you!", "NTA at least from what it sounds like at first. seems like a recurring theme of boyfriends acting out of line and being the root of the problem.", "Why is her bf of one month on your close friend list?? That\u2019s the question. \n\nYou can post what you want - but you clearly have issues understanding norms or what others may perceive as acceptable.\n\nClearly she also has issues and it\u2019s probably coming from the bf to a degree - but yeah I find the whole thing odd. \n\nESH", "YTA why you got your friends bf on private stories if you know you post thirst traps???? Weird af. She need to stay away from you.", "YTA, she has a right to be uncomfortable by something. Maybe she never liked the sexual jokes but took them anyways and finally had enough but for you to say she\u2019s slutshaming/homophobic is not okay. and then you\u2019re shocked that when she tried to talk, maybe when she figured out what the issue was you rejected her of course she\u2019s not going to reach out again. the friendship is over and you\u2019re at fault because you can\u2019t seem to see any wrong in yourself", "Gonna need to see the pic to know for sure if you\u2019re the asshole or not.", "Yta- you need to have this think we like to call self awareness. No girl, Idc who it is, wants their boyfriend to see their best friends booty pics. She also obviously is uncomfortable by your flirty tik toks. If she\u2019s only been dating him for a month why is he even on your private snap? Seems strange.", "NTA overall, but cautiously:  you said you felt betrayed that she couldn\u2019t see your intent.  I get feeling misunderstood, feeling confused.  But she didn\u2019t betray you.  Generally, we are better off when we don\u2019t rely on people knowing our intent\u2014intent is something entirely interior to ourselves.  \nI don\u2019t believe she\u2019s slut-shaming or being homophobic (and to be clear you also said you\u2019re unsure if she is).  She is drawing some apparently new boundaries.  It could be that your friendship will not survive those boundaries.  \nUnsolicited advice from a heterosexual woman who has a close bisexual woman friend:  her deciding that she\u2019s uncomfortable with \u201cflirty\u201d or very sexualized interaction with you is not homophobic.  You both are relatively young and still forming your sexual identities and relationship norms according to your own needs and experiences.  Try not to feel hurt by that.  \nShe clearly has some insecurities to work through and it\u2019s unfair of her to foist the responsibility of that onto you.  Hope you both can figure it out, because clearly this friendship means something to you.  Best wishes!", "NTA unless you send it private to him.", "YTA sorry you ruined your friendship but it was because you crossed her boundaries at least twice. I doubt it was just twice though.", "Soft YTA. You didn't mean anything by it, but you made her very uncomfortable and hurt her feelings. The bf thing with the booty pic, that's just kinda awkward for a girlfriend and best friend because \"body positivity\" and \"sex positivity\"/\"sexual confidence\" often go hand in hand, and it made her feel insecure for her bf to see you that way. That happens with a lot of people, so you should consider that moving forward. \n\nThe TikTok you sent was a joke clearly, but when you had already made her uncomfortable, you probably also made her more sensitive to content that was suggestive of romance/sexuality in your friendship with her. In certain contexts, btw, what you sent would be considered sexual harassment, so it's not good to send that stuff to someone (even a friend) who is on edge, and especially if they have other mental issues. \n\nI wouldn't think she is homophobic or slut-shaming or what have you. If she says she doesn't know what is weird about it, I'd believe her. She's probably trying to process what she feels and why. \n\nWhether or not you meant to do these things, and whether or not you think these things were just kidding or only \"meant for yourself\", anything you do that is in front of others (be it in person or online) can affect them, and you have to take responsibility for that. \n\nYou're not really an AH because of what you posted or sent. You're a bit of an AH because your friend has mental struggles, you made her uncomfortable multiple times, and you're sitting here saying you were \"betrayed\" because your friend took space to process her feelings that you caused. Sorry, I don't think you were the one wronged here.", "NTA take them off your close friends list and be done with it, if they're this childish with a butt picture they don't deserve to be there", "YTA\n\nYour friend should have confronted you earlier about the booty pic on the private with HER BOYFRIEND. Whether or not you intended it to be sexual, it was still wrong though.", "YTA.\n\nSeriously who sends a picture of their (naked?) ass to a group of 20 people?\n\nAlso making weird sexual passes at your bestie? I get that it\u2019s a \u201cjoke\u201d but like, yeah I get why someone in a relationship might put that together with you sending sexual images to her / her bf / your friend group and be weirded out.\n\nUPDATE: NTA based on new information provided by OP in comment. The image was clothed, which changes this pretty significantly in terms of the context. It also appears OP has posted more suggestive pics on socials before that the bff would know about, versus this being just a random one off.\n\nSounds like the new relationship is causing issues perhaps and your bestie is more self conscious perhaps about how you guys joke? Worth a chat if you can figure that out.", "I assume you wouldn\u2019t like it if we all just sent you our unrequested booty pics and started taking passes at you when you\u2019re clearly uninterested in us. \n\nYTA", "Nta \nTell her kick rocks , your body positivity all way round \nShe knows this \nTell her send more butt pics to her bf and stfu", "NTA, but it was thoughtless and careless. You didn\u2019t directly send it to him, but you knew adding him to your close friends he would see it. Be smarter about who you add to your close friends to avoid precisely situations like these.", "YTA. Why do you even have him on your socials? You're looking a little funny there, bud.", "Wow reading comprehension is really lacking in here. I'm going to say NTA. You didn't send pics to her bf specifically, he just happened to see something that was at least semi-publicly posted. If that's wrong, she'll need to keep her bf away from any and all underwear or swimsuit ads that are put up in public like in malls and stuff.\n\nIf anything, it may be weird to send a \"this could be us\" kind of message or tag to your friend, but how weird that is depends entirely on the kind of friendship you have and the humor your have shared together up to that point. Honestly, it might be less about how SHE's uncomfortable with what you post and more about how he reacted to seeing something on her phone or how controlling he is about the kind of friends she has.", "Why did you send a butt pic to your friend\u2019s boyfriend? What was the context? I\u2019m not sure why you felt the need to do that? You say you chose to do that, but why?", "Yeah, when you chat your ass to your friend\u2019s boyfriend, she\u2019s maybe going to get upset about it. \n\nGrow up.

She has told you what is unacceptable to her and it's her decision to no longer interact t\nWith you.  No one is the AH.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA, and first thing\u2019s first, you guys are at the age where some of these lifelong friendships are just going to naturally dwindle, or even snap altogether. I feel like we stopped warning young people about this? Anyway, I don\u2019t love that she flew to an internet dude after one week and is trying to control her friends behaviors around him after a month and a half, but her priority is clearly going from 0-100 in this relationship and that\u2019s where her head is at. Suddenly some of the intimacies she shared with you are now going to seem like you crossing boundaries, because her priority has changed. If she were more mature about it she might be able to verbalize it better, but no, you\u2019re all 22, you\u2019re gonna fight about it, and she\u2019s gonna tell you to get your booty away from where her boyfriend can see it and put up roadblocks when you try and assert your friendship is more intimate than this relationship she\u2019s trying to foster. Take some space from each other (which it sounds like you are), hopefully it\u2019ll blow over, but you\u2019re not an AH here. You\u2019re both just two people growing up.", "So context matters and it was you in a hoodie with pants on. British pants, not American pants.\n\nI find it weird, but thats my issue. If its normal for you and it doesn't bother your friends who cares! Go for it. \n\nHowever, this did bother your friend. And so did the tiktok. Seems like there is a lot more going on here and she doesn't know how to discuss it with you. I am not saying this is the case, but sometimes people laugh at things that make us uncomfortable to avoid having the confrontation. Perhaps, and again, not saying this is the case, your friend has never felt ok with the jokes and memes about you guys being together. Perhaps this was all too much at once and she lashed out as she hasn't said anything before. An overreaction to usual behaviour is usually a sign that things have been brewing for a while. Maybe though her long distance relationship isn't going great. \n\nNAH.\n\nBut she needs to talk to you about all of this and you need to listen and hear her.\n\nAs for the boyfriend, sounds like he was also kind of a friend to you too so not that weird to have him on close fiends. However, you don't know their situation it seems. Has she had a boyfriend before? Has similar happened and then they broke up? Is she insecure about her own ass? All can contribute to her feeling shitty about any comments he may have made or even him seeing it. \n\nMaybe stick to sending those kinda things to people who have said yes please to seeing all your life. Some people feel weird for all kinds of reasons with nudity or suggested nudity. Not your issue, but if you are sending things to people, not just posting them, then perhaps make sure they are ok with it. You also said you were having body dysmorphia at the time, so you understand feeling at odds and having issues with your body. Seeing others so confident can make that in some people (maybe your friend), worse. You didn't do anything wrong, it's your Snapchat, but, your friend was bothered by it and to keep the friendship maybe consider why.", "NTA. If you\u2019ve been best friends that long, she knows that you\u2019re a body positive woman. Since you post and share these media regularly, then she knows that if he was added to the private list there would at some point be one he\u2019d see. With how close you two were I positive she knew he had your private story. So with her already being fully aware of what you post, she should of 1. Told her BF to take himself off the private, or 2. Talk to her about that. If she had spoken up about her feelings to you you yourself probably would of removed him. For her to get mad about something she knew would eventually happen and not voice her opinion on it to you, she is the one at fault. You meant no I\u2019ll will and if it was because of how her BF was reacting to another woman\u2019s photo then I\u2019d say he\u2019s probably looking at others as well and he isn\u2019t the one for her. It\u2019s a lot easier to blame others than yourself though and when you add mental health issues into that, she directed her fault to you", "YTA", "NTA, bc it sounds like something that's normal for you.

No, but ofc you need to do you.)\n\nIf she had a problem she should have spoken with you, not ghosted you.

This included my best friend (21f) and her boyfriend. Alongside 20 other people. After I made the post my best friend since pre-school, suddenly ghosted me and went really weird. We speak every single day and she started ignoring me, not answering my calls and would make excuses to not hang out. She struggles with her mental health and I was worried she was going through an episode and needed help. I gave her space but also kept telling her I am here for her. It wasn\u2019t until almost a month later she sent me a message stating that she has been MIA because of the picture I posted and that \u201cit doesn\u2019t sit right\u201d with her that her boyfriend saw it. She then also stated that I sent her a tik tok that made her uncomfortable and that she\u2019s unsure she wants to be around me anymore. For context, I am bisexual but am in a long term relationship with a male. As our friendship has been for almost 18 years we are very comfortable with one another and something we do is make jokingly flirty comments. The tik tok I sent her was a video of a lesbian couple and my message was \u201cthis could be us but you love dick too much \ud83e\udee6\u201d which was no different to the out of pocket shit she sends me also. I was absolutely heartbroken, I felt so betrayed that she thought I had any ill intent about my picture and her boyfriend. She met her boyfriend on valorant and he lives in a different state. She flew to his state after talking for 1 week and began dating. At this point they were maybe dating for a month and a half. I figured maybe she\u2019s struggling with insecurities and trust issues as it\u2019s a fresh relationship but to then be uncomfortable by me for a tik tok when we have always been like that and she is like that with her other girl friends also. I responded to her message asking for context and apologising for making her uncomfortable and that it was not my intention. I then asked why she had a sudden issue with our flirty jokes and she said she wasn\u2019t sure. I asked if it had anything to do with my sexuality and she said no she just felt weird about it. I\u2019ve spoken to others about the situation and they think she\u2019s insecure and slut shaming/being homophobic. I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s that harsh but I am really hurt. She\u2019s completely out of my life now but she sent me a message another month later saying that she didn\u2019t mean to drive a wedge between us. My response was along the lines of \u201cwhat you said really hurt me, at the moment I am not in the right headspace to speak about it but maybe another day we can catch up and voice our sides and work through this\u201d she left me on read and we\u2019ve not spoken since.\nAm I in the wrong?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Pretty tacky thing to do knowing he would see it, and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re trying to understand your friends pov here but rather wanting people to side with yours.

Considering they met each other online and she flew to another state after ONE WEEK is making it very obvious that your friend is desperate for any kind of male attention. She barely knew the guy and paid for a plane ticket to see him based off surface level info. That says a lot already. Now after not even two months of dating she's cutting off a close friend because he decided to look at your story.\n\n2. BF either really likes you or reeeeally doesn't. Think about it, he probably saw the vids you send your friend and made a big deal about how weird it is or how you guys are way too close. The picture was fuel for the fire. Like a \"see you really want to be friends with this girl?\" A lot of straight men are insecure about their gfs having queer girl friends out of fear you'll \"turn them\". Or he was far too interested in the photo and expressed a fondness for you that destroyed your friend. Either way the real asshole is the new guy. \n\n3. She's only gonna realize this on her own. Go after her boyfriend? She'll probably get defensive. Say you can do whatever you want? She'll slut shame you anyway, she already has. All you can do is give her space and hope that your years and years of friendship won't fall apart because she's too afraid of being alone romantically. I've had 6-10 year friendships end over them getting a boyfriend. \n\nFocus on you OP and I'm really sorry. Hope you found some solidarity in my words.", "NTA. Post what you want on your social media.

I do agree with those who've stated that it may have been too soon to add the besties brand new bf to this close friends chat group. OP even allowed for newness of their relationship to be a contributing factor in this situation. We're all insecure when a new relationship forms, even with a friendship only relationship. OP also acknowledged her besties mental health struggles.

I believe bestie needs to run, not walk, away from the new bf. Bestie's reaction to long-term standards within her and OP'S normal interactions is very telling.  OP, keep letting her know you are there for her and a safe place for her.

I don't think you can make any argument whatsoever that you're promoting body positivity in some way, by specifically allowing your best friends boyfriend to see your ass. \n\nIf she struggles with anxiety and self image, then you adding her brand new bf to your private story is completely out of touch. For someone who is supposed to be her best friend, can you not see how that might make her feel threatened?\n\nShe isn't slut shaming you, and she most certainly isn't being homophobic about the message you sent her.

The problem is the fact that she's added her supposed best friends BRAND new boyfriend to her private story where she posts lewd content.", "At some point they do/did? If the friend didn't want her bf to see behaviour that is normal for the group maybe she shouldn't have added him to the group until she felt comfortable? Rather than suddenly expecting op and possibly other people to suddenly change their behaviour to accommodate her insecurities.", "So sending it to a group chat he\u2019s in **checks notes** doesn\u2019t count as sending it to him?", "It was a private story of close friends where I post a variety of things, sometimes funny vids of me and my bf or friends and maybe 2-3 times I\u2019ve posted those types of pictures. I\u2019m not that close with him but we were all good friends before they started dating and spent a lot of time gaming and on discord as a group. I added him to my story as I added him on Snapchat as he started dating my friend, I post videos of her and I on that story too so it was for him to see those funny vids", "\"thirst trap\" oh my God. It's a picture with an ass in it if that's a thirst trap you need to get out more", "[deleted]", "You are saying negative things about her for posting revealing photos. How is that not slut shaming? Also I'm sure if you could post booty pics and your friends would snap you saying you look great, you would. It's nice to feel desired or attractive there's nothing wrong with that. What's the difference between this and wearing something cute when going out with friends? Obviously I'm not going to convince you any other way bc you're knee deep in this gross ideology but I might as well try. Enjoy your day.", "It is not the same thing. If the chick don\u2019t want her bf seeing the booty pick, he\u2019ll have to unfollow her on insta too, she says in comments she has a lot of lingerie shots on insta, is she just supposed to take them all down so her friends bf can\u2019t see them? Like my guy", "I'm a woman lol", "I regularly post pictures, it\u2019s all over my Instagram been doing it for years. It\u2019s been a few months in between my last post and that specific photo but my public Instagram which her bf also follows, has lingerie pictures also.", "Did op say they needed people to look at their ass? No. They said they were battling body dysmorphia and this is how they chose to deal with it.", "We don't claim you", "Ok, let's see the image and we can judge from there... \ud83e\uddd0", "It\u2019s painful in this subreddit specifically. Lots of angry dudes who just want to call women assholes, and in contrast there\u2019s also lots of angry femcels who want to blame men for everything. \n\nHard to get an unbiased answer here, basically.", "I wonder if rather than her be insecure, her new boyfriend has something to do with her behavior. Maybe HE is the one who finds your behavior inappropriate. I\u2019d be curious to know if she broke up with her BF or something when she reached out to you to mend things. Honestly it seems less about her relationship with you and more about a potentially toxic relationship with her boyfriend.", "I agree with this take too even with OP\u2019s additional comments that have changed my verdict.\n\nIt\u2019s up to the \u201cin\u201d person in the couple to bring someone into a group dynamic successfully. If this thread had a known history of content like this (as it seems to), that\u2019s on the friend for managing expectations. Or she should have gone to OP and said, hey I\u2019m in this new relationship, can you give me a heads up if you\u2019re gonna post some of this stuff?", "It's the diff between going to his house alone and strutting around in a bikini and wearing a bikini around him at a pool party the group is having imo. So no it doesn't.", "Context clues really shine a light on things. \"I have these kinds of pics on my social media, it\u2019s not uncommon of me.\" This wasn't an out-of-the-blue thing to just appear randomly that was completely unexpected, this is a type of thing that this person regularly posts. But it's only a problem NOW for some reason, despite everybody who sees it knowing the person they're following or sharing with on social media. If it wasn't an issue before, why is it an issue now? If it was going to be an issue, why did he get added to the snapchat group where this kind of thing appeared to be a REGULAR OCCURANCE?", "That's an unfortunate oversight on your part then. Either way, the damage is done and it's up to your friends to decide when they feel comfortable with you again. You can also now choose whether or not to put yourself in this situation again. Good luck with everything.", "Apparently OP is the one who doesn\u2019t know how to act on social media. I\u2019m not the one out there losing friends over shared pictures of my ass.", "Did I ask?\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "In that case I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say \n\nNTA \n\nThe pic wasn\u2019t anything she hasn\u2019t seen before she was probably uncomfortable with it being posted for her bf to see but if similar content is on your IG then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable for her to be upset. Maybe she feels like you were doing this cos you\u2019re trying to steal her man and that\u2019s why she felt some type of way. \n\nThe way you worded your original post made it seem like you randomly decided to post a nude on your story for your best friends BF to see which would definitely have made you TA.", "They didn\u2019t say it, they didn\u2019t need to. Pretty obvious from the post", "No she never said that at all", "I\u2019m a woman and I don\u2019t agree with this take?\n\nThe context OP provided in comments was tremendously helpful in changing this from an AH to a NTA situation. \n\nContext matters and knowing your audience matters. OP\u2019s original post seemed to suggest this was totally unprompted nudity, that might make some new recipients (eg the new boyfriend) uncomfortable. But it\u2019s clear now it was nothing more than you\u2019d see at any beach or sidewalk and it was totally in character for OP and this group of friends.\n\nSending unprompted nudity to someone who doesn\u2019t want it I would assume we agree is kind of a jerk thing to do male or female, but now we know that\u2019s not the case here.", "Crass and trashy insults at everyone who disagrees with you. Nice, what are you 13? Grow the fuck up, people can have different experiences and opinions than you. Look up the word nuance.", "Lots of women here who just think sending out pics of your ass to your friend group is a new level of \u201cpick me\u201d.  Maybe she\u2019ll send a pic of her hemorrhoid next because why not.", "Also to add to it I wonder if he\u2019s religious at all? Idk sounds like he might be trying to \u201cchange your friend\u201d to be his ideal girlfriend and pushing away others from her as well", "Absolutely the context of OP\u2019s prior content (and what the \u201cbooty pic\u201d actually was lol) matters here.", "[deleted]", "Are you 12? What a comeback.", "Thank for you asking for context, I may need to edit to clarify. I understand her feelings but from such a long friendship and I myself have been in a very happy health relationship for 2.5 years I\u2019m just confused why she would think I want her man\u2019s", "This.", "Found the kind of dude I was talking about.", "Right? Like if I went on my socials and suddenly started posting myself in boxers in the mirror, my friends would be like \"dude you OK?\" But for other people that's just what they've always done.", "If you don\u2019t think booty shorts and a hoodie can be risqu\u00e9 \u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe ask someone who has some experience to teach you?", "Go feed your 12 cats sister\u270c\ufe0f", "You\u2019ve probably diagnosed the situation correctly in that she felt insecure for whatever reasons. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what happened and I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong as your behaviour was normal and expected. If she didn\u2019t want her boyfriend to see your pictures she should\u2019ve just told him to not add you on social media.", "Happy to have been initially wrong and change my mind on this one!", "So def not you got it \ud83d\udc4d", "A lot of projecting coming off of you rn man. Just say you're an incel and move on.", "Oh. You hurt my feewings.", "I have a girlfriend try again\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Oh my God is this a competition? Alright I have a boyfriend of three years. \ud83e\udd28 And you having a girlfriend doesn't mean you're not an incel look at Andrew tate."]}
