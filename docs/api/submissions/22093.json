If my favorite color was blue, his suddenly would be too. If I grew my hair out long, he let his grow too. If I learned a new instrument, he had to too. I couldn't be an individual and I hated it. What made it worse was that my family would often chose him over me, because he was a smaller and cuter version of myself. It really hurt, and it's contributed to my low self esteem and I still fear to this day that when people meet my brother they will eventually leave me for him. Call me selfish, but it hurts. Whenever I brought this up to my mother, she would blow me off and just said that \"it's what siblings do\". \n\nDuring my freshman year, I came out as a lesbian. I've never liked boys and often found myself having little crushes on girls in my class when I was in elementary school the way that girls would have little crushes on boys. Finally finding a label that described me was freeing and I was (and still am) proud and out to everyone I knew. My brother, following my lead, decided to come out as bisexual the following week.\n\nOnce my mother found out about this she became angry and pulled me aside. She told me that I knew that my brother copies everything I do and that I need to \"tone it down\" so I don't confuse him. Now, I already don't bring up my sexuality often because my father is homophobic and did not accept me for being a lesbian, but this grinded my gears. Throughout my entire life, it was ok for him to copy me even at the expense of my own mental health, but now that he copied something that SHE doesn't want him to be, copying suddenly isn't just \"something that siblings do?\" \n\nRegardless of this situation, I think it's important to explore your sexuality before confirming it and I would support him whether it was just another copying phase or something genuine. I told her this and now she's upset with me for turning her son gay. This was not my intention at all.

And i hope you are not too mad at your brother, sometimes siblings copy eachoter because they look up to you.", "NTA - but your parents are. \n\nYou should never hide or change who you are because of the behaviour or opinions of others.", "NTA. Your brother is 15. If he wants to come out as bisexual he\u2019s old enough to do that. It has nothing to do with you. It\u2019s nothing you should concern yourself about.", "NTA.  YOU didn\u2019t turn him gay.   Even if he is just copying you, that is a decision that he is making for himself. Even at 15 he gets to take responsibility for his own decisions and actions.  \n\nI think if she came back at you with this again, you should kind of throw it back on your parents.  \u201cI dunno, mom. Maybe he hasn\u2019t been copying me this whole time, maybe we are just so similar.  Maybe the things we do are due to genetics. Maybe we both have a \u201cgay gene\u201d that we inherited from one of you two.\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say your brother is an A H, without knowing more about him (eg, if he\u2019s neurodivergent, copying you might be the only way he knows how to fit in), but your mother *definitely* is. Regardless of *why* your brother does this, your parents should have put a stop to it long ago, because it\u2019s clearly bothering you. Plus, it goes without saying that sexuality is something we absolutely have to accept an individual\u2018s own words on.

Has he said anything to her on what she told you?", "You might want to mention to her no one can turn themselves or someone else gay no matter what they do and she s being ridiculous to actually say it never mind thinking it. \n\nJFC \n\nNTA", "He was kind of upset that she only thought he was copying me, but I don't think he's said anything back to her yet.
