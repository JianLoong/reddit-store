If my favorite color was blue, his suddenly would be too. If I grew my hair out long, he let his grow too. If I learned a new instrument, he had to too. I couldn't be an individual and I hated it. What made it worse was that my family would often chose him over me, because he was a smaller and cuter version of myself. It really hurt, and it's contributed to my low self esteem and I still fear to this day that when people meet my brother they will eventually leave me for him. Call me selfish, but it hurts. Whenever I brought this up to my mother, she would blow me off and just said that \"it's what siblings do\". \n\nDuring my freshman year, I came out as a lesbian. I've never liked boys and often found myself having little crushes on girls in my class when I was in elementary school the way that girls would have little crushes on boys. Finally finding a label that described me was freeing and I was (and still am) proud and out to everyone I knew. My brother, following my lead, decided to come out as bisexual the following week.\n\nOnce my mother found out about this she became angry and pulled me aside. She told me that I knew that my brother copies everything I do and that I need to \"tone it down\" so I don't confuse him. Now, I already don't bring up my sexuality often because my father is homophobic and did not accept me for being a lesbian, but this grinded my gears. Throughout my entire life, it was ok for him to copy me even at the expense of my own mental health, but now that he copied something that SHE doesn't want him to be, copying suddenly isn't just \"something that siblings do?\" \n\nRegardless of this situation, I think it's important to explore your sexuality before confirming it and I would support him whether it was just another copying phase or something genuine. I told her this and now she's upset with me for turning her son gay. This was not my intention at all.

Your brother is 15. If he wants to come out as bisexual he\u2019s old enough to do that. It has nothing to do with you. It\u2019s nothing you should concern yourself about.", "NTA.  YOU didn\u2019t turn him gay.   Even if he is just copying you, that is a decision that he is making for himself. Even at 15 he gets to take responsibility for his own decisions and actions.  \n\nI think if she came back at you with this again, you should kind of throw it back on your parents.  \u201cI dunno, mom. Maybe he hasn\u2019t been copying me this whole time, maybe we are just so similar.  Maybe the things we do are due to genetics.

I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say your brother is an A H, without knowing more about him (eg, if he\u2019s neurodivergent, copying you might be the only way he knows how to fit in), but your mother *definitely* is. Regardless of *why* your brother does this, your parents should have put a stop to it long ago, because it\u2019s clearly bothering you. Plus, it goes without saying that sexuality is something we absolutely have to accept an individual\u2018s own words on. If your brother says he\u2019s bisexual, then that\u2019s what he is unless or until he says otherwise.", "NTA. You can't influence someone into having a sexual orientation, much to the chagrin of conservative Christians across the world. If it was that easy they'd have 'fixed' all of us gays years ago. \n\nSadly it seems your father isn't the only homophobe in the family.", "Not at all! Even though it's hurt me a lot, he was just a child at the time and didn't fully understand how it hurt me. We're close now and he's grown apart from me and found his own interests and hobbies and I couldn't be more proud of him.\nHe's still bisexual tho! ;)", "We joke about my father being gay, so this would totally be perfect :D", "I love this idea \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "My brothers definitely not an AH, he was just a kid and he didn't understand how much it affected me. Both of us are neurodivergent if that helps! \nMy brother has grown out of the monkey-see-monkey-do phase and has developed his own hobbies and interests. He's still bisexual, though! :)", "I like that. How does he feel about what your mom have said? Has he said anything to her on what she told you?", "You might want to mention to her no one can turn themselves or someone else gay no matter what they do and she s being ridiculous to actually say it never mind thinking it. \n\nJFC \n\nNTA", "He was kind of upset that she only thought he was copying me, but I don't think he's said anything back to her yet. I told him that I'll always be here to support him and he has a group of friends that supports him as well!", "It's not just your father who is a homophobic asshole. Both parents are.", "Nta your mom and especially your dad are major league ah\u2019s, especially your dad", "well its always ok until it \rinconveniences them. NTA", "Agreed. OP, don\u2019t tone it down. Tone it up!", "This is separate kind of separate from what you posted about but what are the nature of these jokes you make about your homophobic father being gay? Also, you don\u2019t mention if your mom was homophobic when you came out - was she supportive or\u2026?\n\nDo you joke your mom is your dads beard? Or that he isn\u2019t actually attracted to or in love with your mom? That their marriage isnt a real marriage? \n\nHow long have these jokes been going on? Since you came out or do they predate you sharing this with your family? \n\nIm not saying she\u2019s right - parents need to live their children for who they are not who they might wish they were.\n\nYou say he came out a week after you did but you don\u2019t bring up your sexuality because your father is homophobic. Was he like that your whole life? Or did he just start doing that the week after you came out? \n\nI guess I just don\u2019t get the timeline here really. From you coming out, your dads reaction, your brother coming out, your mom pulling you aside etc.", "Lol your brother is adorable. Also NTA. I will say my lesbian sister told me I couldn\u2019t be gay because mom would blame her lol.", "Tell your mom: \"If he's copying me, wouldn't HE also like girls?\"", "Yta", "NTA\n\n\nJust, wow. If you need it, r/momforaminute is really great and supportive. Sounds like you could use some better mom support in life", "NTA. My little sister and I are the opposite in a ton of ways and have always had very different taste in most things growing up. When I came out as trans, I didn't know it at the time but she told me later that it really helped start her journey as a trans woman to see me come out and transition. This may seem like another copying thing to your mom, but lots of queer people realize they're queer when someone close to them comes out. You should be so proud of yourself for coming out, AND for supporting your little brother. Good luck to you both!!", "NTA.  Your mom is TA.  She's also homophobic.  Whether your bro is copying you or not is something you should dig into a little further.  If he truly is bisexual, he may need your guidance & support.", "NTA, your homophobic parents seem alittle dumb. But dumb in the same way all homophobic people are. They think you can somehow \u201cmake him copy you\u201d into being gay, just like they think a gay teacher can make you gay. Which if that were true, both of you should straight since you have straight parents and straight teachers? Also I included your mom in the homophobia because she literally asked you to \u201cTone it down so you don\u2019t confuse him\u201d. She may not be outwardly antagonistic like your father, but the dialogue you presented makes me think she\u2019s just tolerating you. She still doesn\u2019t actually accept it.", "There's a lot here.  Your brother copying you is a compliment.  He idolized you.  If your mother is worried about him copying you now he still does. \n\nYour father is an ass and so is your mother, and I suspect it is their attitude that compromised your self esteem then as it is doing now, not the actual copying.  You don't need me to tell you there's nothing wrong with being gay, and you don't need me to tell you that your brother isn't able to copy his way into it.  Your parents are assholes, did I mention that?  Damn it.  \n\nI hope you get away from these negative influences and into a queer community that values you sooner than later.  You are 1000% NTA.  Please take care of you.", "NTA, you can't control his actions and past precedent has shown you your parents won't either.  This is a situation they created.", "NTA of course and I'm not sure if this is a troll post or not, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. If he did copy you all this time, take it as a compliment. Something about you he doesn't have. Judging by your parents' ignorance about sexuality, I wouldn't be surprised that your brother has issues. The story of someone turning someone else gay is beyond silly. It's 2023 and nobody has any excuse with all the information out there to think you can make someone gay. You are or you aren't. If you're 18 as you say, it's a good opportunity to get out of that toxic environment, but cut your brother some slack and try to have some one-on-one time with him to see what is happening in that head of his. Take the copy stuff as a compliment, but talk to him. One day your parents will be long gone and it will just be you and your brother.", "Regardless of why your brother does this, your parents should have put a stop to it long ago, because it\u2019s clearly bothering you.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "**BOT ALERT**     \nPlease report as Spam > Harmful Bots.\n\n(Seriously, hacker?)\n\nComment (partially) copied from [here](\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ye1ly/aita_for_letting_my_brother_copy_me/jrs68n8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)", "**BOT ALERT**     \nPlease report as Spam > Harmful Bots.\n\n(What kind of dipshit programmer lets his bot copy from the OP's comments?)\n\nComment (partially) copied from [here](\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ye1ly/aita_for_letting_my_brother_copy_me/jrs68n8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)"]}
