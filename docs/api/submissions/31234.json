He quickly got addicted and ended up dropping out of college, causing him to develop depression. My husband and I supported him through this and it was a constant up and down. My husband had good position at the company he worked at and managed to get our son a job. When he was 23, he found a nice girlfriend and moved in with her. Everything was good until he relapsed. His girlfriend left him, he went to rehab again and started dating another woman he met a month after getting out of rehab. This relationship lasted 2 years and ended due to toxicity and cheating on both sides.\nAfter this relationship ended, he relapsed again. My husband and I made him move in with us again so we could help him through his problems along with a therapist. \n\nThis year he finally got better and seemed to be on a good path. He decided to go back to college again. We were so proud of him and supportive of his decision. About a month ago he called me and told me that he met someone and was in love. I was happy for him and told him I was excited to meet her. Today we met up for brunch and he finally introduced us to his new girlfriend. When I first saw her, I was schocked at how young she looked. When I asked her about her age, she told me that she was 18 years old. They met at college. She\u02bcs a very pretty and friendly girl, but the age gap is appalling to me. My husband was just as schocked as I was. I didn\u2019t say anything while his girlfriend was around, since I didn\u02bct want to upset her. But when I got home and my son called me, I just sighed and told him that I\u02bcm not supportive of this relationship and that he shouldn\u02bct date a teenager who just graduated high school this year. I also reminded him of his addiction and said that I\u02bcm scared that he\u02bcll relapse again and drag this poor girl into such a scary situation. This made him upset and he told me that he\u02bcs finally happy after years of depression and that he really loves this girl. He hung up the phone and didn\u02bct reply to my messages.

Your concerns are valid. A 29 year old man should not be dating an 18 year old girl. There\u2019s no way he sees her as an equal partner. He\u2019s probably happy because he found someone he can manipulate into doing everything his way. Your son has a history of relapsing when his relationships don\u2019t work out. This relationship has a very low chance of success so you\u2019re justified in being concerned that he\u2019ll relapse again. I think it\u2019s admirable that you\u2019re also considering the impact a potential relapse could have on his gf.

This must be hard as parents to go through this so I'm very sorry you're dealing with it. You are completelty valid and justified in being concerned and disapproving of this. I'm 23 and I'd feel a bit weird about dating an 18 year old so for a 29 year old thats crazy. I don't know what the solution here is but I wish you the best.", "NTA, that age difference would concern me as a parent, whatever genders involved. It's okay to express concern, you did that, he didn't take it well, but your standpoint is understandable.", "NTA, its weird that an almost 30 year old is in a relationship with a girl who had to raise her hand to ask to go to the bathroom less than a year ago", "NTA - he\u2019s being a creep. He\u2019s almost 30 years old and dating a teenager.", "NTA, but here's a thought: your son has spent many of his adult years lost in addiction. Emotionally, he may not be much \"older\" than 18. You've said your piece. As hard as it is, if he can stay sober and on track with this young woman, it might work out. I don't blame you for being very concerned for all involved, though.", "I hate to tell you this, but your son's a creep. Nta", "OP you should say something to this girl privately. I was that 19 yr old, dating a 25 yet old, thinking we were on the same level and only years later realising he couldn't date his age mates because they would notice his \u26f3.

This won't be his last 18 yr old girlfriend.

Your choice of phrasing to him in your concern may contribute to his anger about the situation. As I have no idea of the conversation and wouldn't dare ask, I would simply say that nobody wants to hear a truth that doesn't agree with what they want...at first.\n\nYour son is an addict, but not an AH. He's in love and love blinds early. He very well may be making a difficult situation for himself. Your support and his willingness to repeatedly attempt sobriety are both admirable in this case, and he will need both to continue recovery for the rest of his life. He will stumble, YOU will stumble. Humanity is a curse that way.\n\nHe's not breaking any laws that I'm aware of and he seems happy. Love him. Support him. You've expressed your opinion and he is currently rejecting it. The last thing that will help is to repeat it if he thought it was hurtful. Nothing says you can't be interested in his life and offer guidance, but the line between NAH and YTA gets extremely blurry when you begin to think you should interfere because then you may cause the exact thing you are afraid of.\n\nI hope this isn't offensive, I mean none. I empathize with you. Our children are our most precious gift and we never want to hurt them. I am merely offering you *MY* take on this and I would suggest that you involve a professional with a background in the psychology of addiction in this for YOU as well as if he would like to talk to someone impartial about it.\n\nThank you for your time.", "Nta", "Ur son is a loser poor girl", "Your concerns are valid, but my (addiction specialist) therapist has pointed out to me many times that an ongoing addiction significantly stunts a persons social development, especially early in life. Mentally, emotionally, and materially, he is in a very similar stage of life to an 18 year old. This is not exactly the same as an average 29 year old dating an 18 year old and even though he is potentially exposing her to some scary shit, I really doubt he has a significant upper hand on her socially the way many 29 year old men with an established home and career would. That doesn\u2019t make them exactly equal, but I think it makes sense that he would be in a relationship with someone younger than him. With all the years lost to addiction, he\u2019s basically a sophomore in college rn. Women his own age who are in a similar phase of life to him have probably either similarly struggled with addiction (often a toxic combination) or are otherwise deficient that they\u2019d be dating a 29 year old undergrad student with a couple rehab stints under his belt. I don\u2019t say that to disparage him, just to point out why it makes much more sense for him to date someone with a similar amount of real life experience rather than someone his own age. Can you honestly picture an average 29 year old woman, established in her career and lifestyle/socially developed and financially/emotionally independent dating your son at this exact moment? I doubt he is ready for that, or that it would even be the best thing for him. I honestly really empathize with his desire to date someone who is naive in love, I can see how that would feel like a fresh start for him. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right, but I get it, and I think you should prioritize getting it over admonishing him for it.\n\nEven though you are right to be concerned, throwing your sons relapses in his face in that moment had to be just about the worst possible response. As his mother, prioritize supporting him in finishing college and staying sober, take your hands off the wheel in all other areas. He\u2019s an adult who needs to learn to make his own decisions, even if they are bad ones. I think ESH, but imo you suck worse. I get why you feel the way you do but I think his years of dependence have understandably led to a bit of a control pattern and in reality, it is no parents place to control who their child dates as long as everything is legal and not abusive.", "ESH. Unfortunately your son and the girl are both adults. As someone who went through something somewhat similar many many moons ago, support would be better. Being happy that they\u2019re happy and so on. Once your kids are adults I feel it\u2019s important to support and not \u2018parent\u2019 your child. You don\u2019t have to like it, but if he\u2019s happy, then he\u2019s happy. \n\nAs for the son, he kind of sucks. He shouldn\u2019t be dating a girl that young. He should probably try and establish himself a little bit longer. You didn\u2019t mention how long he\u2019s been clean but if it hasn\u2019t been more than 4 years, he should probably focus on his own shit. But alas this is something he\u2019ll have to figure out on his own. \n\nThe young lady is the only NTA. Hopefully she leaves. Young girls shouldn\u2019t date older men with a history of problems.

It is none of your business whom he dates under these circumstances. If you keep insisting on being judgmental you will loose him...which after all you have been through with him on his road to sobriety would be a shame.", "Concerns are valid. But it\u2019s not your place to go anything beyond that.

As in, \"if you don't support everything I do, I might relapse?\" If so, that would be troubling. If not, then that's good, and he is simply disappointed.\n\nYou are not bound to support *everything* he does, especially when you think it's a bad idea. However, you can't really stop him. So all you can really do is tell him that your concerns are valid, and that you are sorry that he is disappointed by your response, but that you love him and will treat his girlfriend well for as long as she is in your life. Tell him that you would absolutely love to be proven wrong, and that you wish for both of their happiness every day.\n\nNAH", "YTA. Your immature son is with an immature girl and it works for them.

I'm sure if you backed off about it you could just keep an eye on how things develop. You might be used to being controlling about your son's life simply because of the trauma of trying to help him through addiction.

She\u2019s telling me something she feels I should know in order to be safe. \n\nWe\u2019re not talking about the average adult here. We\u2019re talking about a recovering addict. When the average person gets their heart broken, the process they go through is much different than the one a recovering addict goes through. OP\u2019s son has relapsed after a failed relationship not once but twice. OP is justified in pointing out the this pattern of behavior. You\u2019re basically suggesting that OP stand by while their son goes down a self destructive path that only leads to the grave or to  prison. OP\u2019s son\u2019s choice to date someone is evidence that his approach to life hasn\u2019t changed.

She is not clairvoyant and honestly has no idea how good or bad of a choice this is. Warning you about obvious danger is completely different from admonishing your child for doing things wrong. That\u2019s all aside from the fact that she didn\u2019t say what she said to protect her kid\u2014she said it to protect his girlfriend.\n\nNowhere did I say she has no right to be concerned or voice her concerns. You are dancing around my very clearly stated point to insist on yours\u2014the WAY she stated her perspective was harmful to her son/a massive overstep/an overly hasty condemnation, and if she wants to help maintain his sobriety she should focus less on what she has the \u201cright\u201d to say and more on what would be constructive to point out.\n\nYour mom probably doesn\u2019t text you \u201cwatch out for black ice\u2014you could kill someone given that you\u2019re a really crappy driver who\u2019s been in a ton of accidents\u201d.

The parents of addicts have no further right to tell their children what to do, not because it wouldn\u2019t potentially keep them from getting into trouble, but because that\u2019s not a sustainable dynamic for ANY parent to enter with their child.

He\u2019s dating. He\u2019s a grown man dating a teenager. That kind of dynamic never ends well. You can\u2019t sugar coat the truth with a recovering addict.

People change and do new things constantly. If that\u2019s how OP chooses to approach this with her son (looks like she has), she is very clearly implying that he will *never* stay sober, he will *always* be an addict and he will *always* make bad choices. As a parent, I will always approach my child with hope and belief in their ability to be better\u2014especially considering how much better OPs son is already doing. I hate how much I\u2019ve had to repeat myself in this conversation\u2014a 29 year old longtime addict is not at all on the same emotional level and a 29 year old self sufficient adult who\u2019s never struggled with drugs. This is a known factor in new sobriety and an important distinction because this is not quite as simple as \u201ca grown man dating a teenager\u201d. I never said it was a good idea, but common sense is for people to have about *their own behavior*.\n\nIt\u2019s so strange to me that you think her being blunt will in any way keep her son from doing what he wants anyway.  Like any child in the history of ever has stopped dating someone they\u2019re madly in love with because their mom said not to. This is the essence of my point about control\u2014you are giving pointers on how to more forcefully control her son, I am establishing the reality that she cannot do that no matter how she tries, and the most likely outcome of pushing this argument is alienating herself from her son. He has made it clear by his response that he\u2019s \u201cgoing to do what he wants anyway\u201d in your words\u2014AND now he\u2019s not speaking to her. Not a nice scenario for anyone involved. *Once again*\u2014she did NOT tell her son she was concerned for him. She told her son she was concerned for his girlfriend *when he eventually relapses*\n\nMy mom wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a crappy driver because \u201cwatch out for black ice, I love you and want you to be safe\u201d will do just fine without tearing me down in the process or framing her concern as being completely about the safety of others. And btw\u2014I *have* been in a terrible accident that was my fault and nearly killed me. When I was younger, less experienced, and less equipped to drive safely. As I have aged and gained experience and maturity, I have *become* a good driver, thankfully with the love and unwavering support of my parents. I guess that\u2019s the difference between our perspectives! I won\u2019t be replying further to this thread\u2014OP, I hope your son has a bright future of sobriety and peace!", "I made no disagreement. I simply asked your opinion. I'm a little confused why everyone is upset that I asked for a clarification, especially when it adds even more context to what you were originally saying. Weird place.", "The hate on this sub is amazing. I love it. Give me more lol", "OP did not imply that he will never stay sober and always make bad choices. She was telling him that she\u2019s still in a vulnerable stage of his recovery, this relationship is not a good idea and based on his history, he is putting himself at risk for a potential relapse since failed relationships are a trigger for him. That\u2019s where he is in his life right now. \n\nNot sugar coating things may not stop him from doing what he wants but at least he heard what OP said and hopefully he will come to realize OP was right. Have you had a close family member who battled addiction. I do. My mom\u2019s brother is a revering addict. He\u2019s been sober for almost thirty years now and he didn\u2019t get there by having family members who sugar coated the truth. He put my late grandmother, my mom and my aunts through so much hell. Unless you know what it\u2019s like to personally walk with someone on their journey towards recovery, you should not be saying that OP\u2019s method is wrong.", "Nice try, and proof you haven\u2019t been reading my comments. Why do you think I\u2019m in counseling with a substance abuse specialist? My dad is a recovering addict. He\u2019s been sober for a decade through the unwavering love and support of our family (and a 12 step program). You do you and I\u2019ll keep doing me\u2014treating my addict relatives in recovery (OPs son is currently in recovery and doing very well) with support and tactful nudges in the right direction. That would be because they are adults, who chose to wreak havoc on our families the same way THEY must *choose* to do better for themselves and their loved ones. You can pretend as much as you want that making that choice for them works, but it doesn\u2019t. Once again all the best to OPs family.", "I've read your logic. It is sound in many aspects, yet flawed on a very important level in the process of addiction recovery. Addicts perform better with positive encouragement rather than negative. You might automatically assume that reminding someone with addiction issues that they're an addict to help guide them would be a positive help. It actually, in the mind of an addict, can possibly cause what is referred to as a paradoxical effect.\n\nThe crux of this is that addicts never forget they're addicts...ever. They don't need a reminder. When someone points this out in a way that sets off the fight-or-flight response, many addicts will choose flight. An overwhelming fear grips them. Fear of what? They know they've relapsed before, but one of the first things you need to do to recover is establish a NEW routine...changing everything in your life is sometimes required protocol in some addiction management programs. When they have someone that they love and loves them say things like that, it can \"snap\" a little bit of that new routine. \n\nNow, I'm not sure what your familiarity with autistic people or addicts is, but in both of those instances a broken routine does not have a pleasant or even predictable outcome for the person. For the same reason autistic children start to decompensate and behave in extreme manners, addicts start to decompensate. I'm sure, since you had an uncle that battled addiction, that you know exactly what will happen if an addict starts to decompensate for their addiction. This is that paradoxical effect.\n\nOP did what she thought was right by advising her child on the manner, yes. Nothing wrong with that. OP may have touched that nerve though, even if she didn't actually cause a decompensation. Dealing with her son in a manner that acknowledges he is happy and that he can make better choices while recovering can be infinitely more beneficial than making him feel like he's on a circular track and can't build that new routine he needs for recovery. I speak from a position of watching addiction very close to me wreak havoc on the lives it touched. Enjoy your weekend."]}
