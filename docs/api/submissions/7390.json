How many of these \"pranks\" have Dale been pulling on your son?  \n\nBecause News Flash raising someone's hope up and crushing them isn't a prank....it's a dick move that only unstable or bitter people do.", "A prank would be giving him the toy car\u2026& THEN giving him the actual car he promised.\n\nWhat your husband did is cruel.

It is super common to have a prank gift like a toy car to a new driver, but then inside it there is an actual key to an actual car for the actual gift. Like, it was often a used car with \"special, unique features\", but something that gets a teen from point A to point B. \n\nY'all are just assholes. And then do it in front of his friends & family.

You are equally guilty, you could have saved your son from this disappointment and embarrassment.", "YTA. How can it be a \"prank\" when you in your own words say your son was: BEYOND THRILLED about the thought of getting a car.

Absolute humiliation and crushing disappointment. \n\nNot to mention the betrayal is actually coming from the parents/steps in this case. It's disgusting bullying. \n\nAlso, I think this is a carefully calculated scheme by Dale to drive a wedge between OP and her son.
