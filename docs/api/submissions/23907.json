I think of her like a sister. Due to health conditions, she has always known that conception would be difficult for her. It is very unfair, and we\u2019ve many discussions about it. Around the time we were in high school or college, I offered to one day donate my eggs to her if she is unable to conceive naturally. This was not something I forced upon her, nor did she pressure me to offer this. It has been a mutual discussion we\u2019ve circled back to every few years, and we\u2019re very much on the same page. I trust she would make an amazing mother and I would be able to have an aunt-like relationship with her children. \r  \n\r  \nFlash forward to the present day, and we are both now married. Me and my husband (27M) do not have kids, and are not planning to have kids until mid-30s when we have more money and a nice house. She and her husband (28M) have been married two years and are looking into family planning. As she has gone through testing, it seems she is unable to conceive or carry a child at all. So, if they were to have a baby, they would need both an egg donation and a surrogate. A surrogate can be very expensive, and so she asked me the other day my honest thoughts on taking on that role (This would basically mean I\u2019d skip egg retrieval and just receive artificial insemination, and then carry the baby). I said I\u2019d like to think about it, and she respected my answer. \r  \n\r  \nA couple evenings later, I told my husband about the situation and how I was still mulling it over. He got upset and said he wasn\u2019t comfortable with me carrying another man\u2019s baby, especially before his own. His tone came across as accusatory, and I reminded him that this was entirely clinical and that thousands of women donate eggs and are surrogates, but he said that this wasn\u2019t about the medical procedure, it was something we both had to live with for nine months. He felt that this was not something I should be allowed to decide without consulting him, since pregnancy would involve him as well (supporting me through the journey, helping me around the house etc.). He also said he would feel weird seeing me pregnant with another man\u2019s baby and he wasn\u2019t sure if he could see me the same if I went through with it. After some back and forth, he told me firmly that I could only have my friends baby if we could unanimously agree on it, and that he would never agree. \r  \n\r  \nI understand his points, but I also think that at the end of the day it is my body. And this has been something I\u2019ve discussed with my friend since before either of us even met our husbands, so it feels like I should still be allowed to make this decision on my own, even if that decision is no. \r  \n\r  \n(FYI: He and I have discussed donating my eggs to my friend before, and he never seemed to mind that, but I also don\u2019t know how seriously he took the conversation).\r  \n", "created_utc": 1691206853, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ikxuh/aita_for_not_consulting_my_husband_about_having/", "score": 446, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your putting your life on the line. One unfortunate complication could leave you unable to carry your own child someday.\n\nYour husband is right. This has to be a mutual decision. It may be your body but this affects him greatly. \n\nThere are medical bills. Clothing expense. He would be taking care of you. He would have to put your life on hold for 9 months.\n\nThere are alot of things to consider. If you care less about his concerns and more about your friend then your marriage is in trouble. You cannot expect to make such a huge unilateral decision and expect him to deal with the consequences.\n\nYes you promised before you where married. But now you have to take your husbands feelings into consideration. If you don\u2019t this could very well end your marriage. Is loosing your husband something you can live with because he is telling you that you being a surrogate is not something he can come to terms with?", "YTA\n\nChoosing to get pregnant even if you won't be keeping the baby at the end of the day is a decision which impacts both of you. Even if it's smooth sailing, you'll likely need support before and after. On the other end of the scale, you could end up disabled or even dead. And yes, there can be emotional impact as well for both partners. \n\nIt's very rare that a reputable surrogacy service will let a woman who has never had a successful pregnancy of her own be a surrogate, so this is likely a non-issue regardless.", "YTA and no ethical surrogacy agency would let you be a surrogate without your spouse's blessing. Do you really think that carrying a baby is no big deal as long as you don't plan to keep it? Especially a baby that's biologically yours? (That's not generally considered ethical either, by the way.) You should care about your husband's feelings on this.", "Before you fight with your husband about this, you need to confirm that you\u2019re eligible to be a surrogate. Most doctors would require that you successfully carry a baby to term before you can become a surrogate. Imagine how you would feel if you went through an emotional roller coaster to make this decision only to find out that you weren\u2019t an eligible candidate.", "YTA. You are married and you expect your husband to fine with you having a baby with another man because your friends husband wants a bio kid?\n\nAnd if you think it\u2019s just \u2018nine months\u2019 and then done you are both incredibly naive and misinformed. \n\nOn the milder side: it could take many many tries for the insemination to take, you\u2019ll have to miss work and thereby lose income, the expense for new cloths and more food.\n\nAnd on the serious side: you can lose your hair or go permanently and prematurely grey, lose your teeth, get brittle bones, get diabetes, go blind, end up paralyzed or just plain old die. \n\nPregnancy is No joke nor walk in the park. Take it seriously.\n\nYou are asking your husband if he\u2019s fine with you risking your health and life so another dude can have a bio kid because they are too shallow and egotistical to adopt.", "> I understand his points, but I also think that at the end of the day it is my body. And this has been something I\u2019ve discussed with my friend since before either of us even met our husbands, so it feels like I should still be allowed to make this decision on my own, even if that decision is no.\n\n...okay, but he has the right for this to be a complete dealbreaker for him.  That would not be unreasonable.  Just be fully prepared for him to leave you over this.", "YTA\n\nThat's a divorce, right there.  You don't make huge life-altering decisions like that without many talks with your spouse.  This just shows how much you don't care about him.", "YTA and this is NOT how surrogacy works. You have to have had at least one child in order to be a surrogate. You also have to undergo counseling. Also this would be your child with another man, surrogates usually have no relation to the child. Are you so sure you\u2019ll be able to give up the baby? Watch your child grow up with your friend raising it? This is a horrible idea. I think offering the eggs is a kind offer, it should end there", "Question: if you were single, would you do this on your own, or does having your husband there to help make you feel more capable of doing it?\n\nEither way, any major unilateral decision made when you're in a relationship is a YTA move. That's just basic respect.", "Yta.  Pregnancy is ROUGH.  You will need your husband support.  Whine I get that this is your body, this decision you're making will dramatically affect him too.  You need to be prepared for those consequences.", "I've known some surrogates, nice ladies. \n\nI'd never agree to it and if my Wife agreed to it or did it behind my back I'd be consulting divorce lawyers.\n\nNot to mention that surrogates are expensive for a reason. Pregnancy takes a massive toll on your body, you're risking your health and well being.\n\nFrankly I don't think you've actually thought about this at all.\n\nYTA", "YTA - being pregnant with someone else\u2019s child is completely different than donating an egg. Your husband has every right to be pissed he wasn\u2019t consulted.", "YTA. Your husband is entitled to an opinion on this.  Based on all of the comments above, you haven't done any research on what's involved. You should not be making an emotional decision.", "YTA. Pregnancy carries medical risks. And it's an emotional rollercoaster with all the hormones, plus after you have a baby, some things are changed forever. You'll likely be peeing every time you sneeze. And there's a (small) risk you may nevee be able to have another baby.\n\nYour life partner should absolutely get a chance to contribute to that decision.  It will impact him too.", "YTA\n\nBut I also feel like this is a pointless argument anyway since one of the first requirements of surrogacy is that you have to have already successfully carried a baby to term before. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a doctor willing to do it for you. Unless you\u2019re thinking of going the old school turkey baster route \ud83e\udd22", "YTA- you should have discussed this more thoroughly before you married. He'd already agreed to the donation of eggs, which is already a big deal, but actually carrying the baby for your friend is an exponentially bigger deal, and much more for him to deal with. You're right, it is your body, but it's understandable he'd feel this is too much of an ask for him.", "I don\u2019t want to say YTA, but you have no idea what you\u2019re getting into and how intense and perilous it can be. Pregnancy is potentially dangerous and it can take a huge toll on your body and health. It can also take a toll on your mental health. You don\u2019t know if it will go smoothly or if it will be a very rough experience. Some pregnancies have very little complications and some could require you to be on 8 month\u2019s bed rest with dangerously high blood pressure. The latter could occur even if you are a very healthy, fit person. There are myriad ways as well in which your body will change during pregnancy whether or not health problems occur. During all of this you will need a tremendous amount of support. If your husband isn\u2019t all in on this idea, it will be hard and resentment will potentially grow. It could really test the limits of your relationship. Also, all of the firsts that happen in a pregnancy, many of which are amazing and beautiful, will be happening with someone else\u2019s baby not your own. It\u2019s possible you might regret that aspect of the surrogacy even though it is a nice thing to do. It might be better to do a surrogacy after you\u2019ve already carried your own baby and had your own pregnancy. That way all the \u201cfirsts\u201d are with you, your husband, and your baby.", "YTA", "Look, I\u2019ve had two very difficult pregnancies, one almost  resulting in our deaths. \n\nThis will affect your husband too. If you get too sick, have complications etc he will have to be the sole income earner. \n\nWhat if you can\u2019t have children after this ? It\u2019s not safe for me to have another child now. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be negative but pregnancy and giving birth isn\u2019t just something you \u2018do\u2019 it can be a really smooth and easy birth and pregnancy but things can go wrong. \n\nI always believe it\u2019s best to go through something formal and legal because it can protect you and the child too. \n\nYou really have to think about this and have serious talks with your husband and friend. \n\nAnd this can take a while. You\u2019re in your late 20s and there will be more risks the older you get ( I had mine in my mid 30s) \n\nWhile it\u2019s certainly your body, imagine your husband donated sperm without telling you first", "YTA.  It's amazing to me that you would even have to ask.", "YTA-maybe a terrible comparison but bear with me. It\u2019s kind of like adopting a dog without discussing it with your partner. Even if you say you\u2019ll be the one taking care of it-it still will impact them (hair in the living space probably having to take it for walks). YTA if you get a dog without consulting your partner and I think the same hold true here. \n\nJust imagine how it would be for your husband. You get pregnancy cravings-he has to go to the store. And that\u2019s just the small stuff. As others have described in more detail, You don\u2019t know how pregnancy will impact you. \n\nInfo: why did you not ask your husbands views on the situation and wait so long to tell him? It seems like you\u2019re treating it as if his opinions doesn\u2019t matter at all-which I\u2019m guessing is a part of his reaction to the whole thing. I understand it is your body your choice-and fully support that. But even in the obvious analogue of abortion I would think that in most healthy marriages the partners would discuss it together even if the ultimate decision lies with the person carrying the child.", "YTA.\n\nYes, it's your body, but you will need your husband's support in this.", "I don't think it is a good idea to be a surrogate before you have your own children. There are probably many reasons why this isn't considered to be a good idea. What if during this pregnancy something happens to you physically which would result in you being unable to carry any further children? What if this pregnancy becomes the only one you will ever be able to have? How would you feel handing that baby over to your friend knowing that you can never have another child of your own?", "YTA. You might need a lot more help than \u201chelp around the house.\u201d What happens if you are put on bed rest for a few months and can\u2019t work?", "YTA not for wanting to do something wonderful for your best friend, but for disregarding your partner\u2019s valid concerns.  Your husband was okay with the egg donation, but getting pregnant is a lot more involved. It will effect him as well. \n\nIt seems that you haven\u2019t really considered the reality of pregnancy for your physical and mental health and the impact on your relationship. Lots of things can happen. Your own health may be impacted long term if there are complications. \n\nAlso, the last trimester can be tough. It can be very uncomfortable and your spouse will be the one supporting you. Your sex life will be impacted for months. If you do this without him being on board, your relationship will likely suffer. \n\nPlease thoroughly research what pregnancy actually does to your body before you commit yourself to carrying the baby as well. I work in the medical field and many women are not prepared or knowledgeable about how severe pregnancy changes can be. \n\nWeigh the pros and cons, especially if they can afford a surrogate. I would also suggest discussing this calmly and really hearing your spouse\u2019s concerns and telling him why it\u2019s so important to you that YOU carry the baby. Hopefully, it\u2019ll help you to  understand each other better and you can come to a decision that you\u2019re BOTH comfortable with. Your may want to consider talking this out in couples counselling if it\u2019s too hard to resolve the issue yourselves.", "As a pregnant woman I agree with where your husband is coming from. There\u2019s nothing clinical about this situation. YTA.", "YTA.  I hope this is a troll.   This is awful.   Are you going to work the whole time, still do stuff with hubby, still do chores, or is your time going to be occupied.   What if there are complications and this turns out to be the only child you will ever have.   And you had it for this guy.  Boy, what an ugly situation to put your husband into.   You married him, not your friends husband.   Get out of their lives and spend some time and energy on your husband instead.", "Total asshole YTA YTA YTA!!! You don\u2019t make life changing decisions without your partner!!! This is not adopting a puppy or getting a haircut he might not like. If you discussed this with your friend before marriage you should have warned your husband so he could have skipped the proposal. If you go through with this I\u2019m sure you will do it as a single person. You might not even qualify since you haven\u2019t had kids anyways.", "Having a baby is a *bit* different than just not liking someone else's clothing. He's told you he isn't comfortable with it. He's basically said it's a dealbreaker--if you choose to go forward with surrogacy knowing it could break your relationship then fine, that's the choice you made. But he's entitled to his opinion and you to yours.", "YTA.  A planned pregnancy, regardless of who the child belongs to, is ALWAYS a \"two yes; one no\" issue, meaning if one of you says no then it doesn't happen. \n\nIf you care so little about your husband that you would go forward with this against his consent, then just divorce him and do it by yourself.", "YTA. If you push this it WILL destroy your marriage.", "YTA", "Yeah.  That man deserves to leave you.", "YTA he is right, he deserves a say and you should not be deciding this without him.", "Using the my body argument here is so out of place and really ridicules the many places it does apply.\n\nImagine if he fucked another girl cause it\u2019s \u2018his body\u2019. Yeah, YTA", "Feel like it\u2019ll be split so imma say slight YTA. He\u2019s right that this will have a major impact on his lifestyle and there\u2019ll be stuff he\u2019ll have to do since you\u2019re his wife. I can also understand not wanting his wife to be pregnant with someone else\u2019s baby. This is definitely something you both just discuss fully together as a team. I\u2019m all for your body your choice but you should also take into account how your team dynamics will be altered.", "It\u2019s your body but something like this would have a dramatic impact on both your lives.\n\nEven jobs should be something couples agree on, where to live etc.  The entire point if a relationship together is making big decisions together.  Once one person is willing to break that and go unilateral on a big , life changing choice?  Dead relationship\n\nIf we were talking a tattoo or piercing but one thing, that\u2019s more in line with a weekend work conference, but actual surrogacy?  Would you be ok if your hubby took a new job that required him to move or travel 50% of the year even if you were against it\n\nYTA", "YTA and it\u2019s puzzling why you don\u2019t get this!", "YTA", "100% YTA for so many reasons.\n\nOP, pregnancy can be really rough. There is a good chance you\u2019ll be very sick, possibly for weeks in the first trimester, or put on bed rest, or even if you\u2019re lucky and have none of the very common side effects, there will come a point where you will not be physically capable of doing certain things. There will be periods where you\u2019ll have to work less, your body is growing an entire person! You also may be permanently physically damaged, such as future infertility, diabetes, or permanent incontinence. Your husband will have to pick up the slack if any of these occur. I presume you\u2019ll expect him to care for you if you\u2019re unwell? Your husband has to agree to pick up the slack that you will need given to you, and he\u2019s allowed to say no.\n\nThe whole reason why surrogates are supposed to have had a child already, is to rule out those who really struggle with pregnancy - and that is like half of all women.\n\nWorst case scenario: pregnancy and childbirth are still dangerous. Idk where you are based, but the US still has a concerning maternal mortality rate. You could d word. He\u2019s allowed an opinion for that alone. \n\nBecause your pal doesn\u2019t have eggs to give, it\u2019ll be your biological child. Husband gets to say that that\u2019s a deal breaker to him, you carrying a child that is biologically yours and another man\u2019s. Also you\u2019ll have to old fashioned turkey baster it bc it\u2019s not even surrogacy, it\u2019s just having your friends husbands child to give to her.\n\nIt\u2019s your body, yes, but it\u2019s both of your marriage. Big life altering stuff like this has to be a two yes situation. One yes one no = no. It\u2019s not fair to your husband to tell him he gets no say, and don\u2019t expect him to not resent you/leave if you push ahead anyway.\n\nEDIT: Also, legal reasons. This child will be your biological child. As you are married, your husband will be presumed the father by law. You would have to then establish paternity in court, deal with severing your legal rights as a parent/custody arrangement in favour of bio father. Depending on the laws where you live this may be considered abandonment. Then your friend is either legally a step mother to the child or she adopts them following severance of your legal rights. All of this likely wouldn\u2019t be any cheaper than if you just donated your eggs and they paid a proven surrogate to carry in the end. \n\nAdditionally, you may all be good friends now, but what happens if the kid gets sick, and they burn through all their savings/assets (very very possible if you\u2019re American) and they then have no choice but to sue you for child support? They\u2019d very likely have a case to do so in such a scenario.", "YTA \n\nDid you bother to investigate surrogacy at all before you agreed to it? If you go to a licensed accredited clinic you have to have carried a child and given birth before you can be a surrogate. You haven\u2019t.\n\nWhat are you going to do? Do it the old fashioned way and sleep with your friend\u2019s husband? Did she agree to that? You made an offer when you were young and neither one of you knew anything about it. The problem is your a grown woman now and still doing that! You two need to grow up and actually investigate what your talking about and find out the requirements before making all these insane promises and blowing up your marriage.", "You\u2019re wonderful for wanting to give your friend the gift of parenthood. That\u2019s amazing.\n\nYTA for not IMMEDIATELY discussing it with your husband. How would you feel if your husband discussed a donation of sperm to a friend before he impregnated you without immediately coming to you? Now imagine you had to watch this friend gestate and birth your husband\u2019s child before you got to. How would that feel for you? Try to see it from his perspective. You could literally die. Then what. Your husband would have lost his wife while another couple gets the only piece left of you. There\u2019s so much more here than it just being your body.", "YTA slightly, he deserves a say as this does affect him. However most places/doctors will require you to have had one pregnancy carried to term before you can become a surrogate so you\u2019ll likely not be able to do anyway. Donating eggs and being a surrogate are not even remotely the same. His feelings matter and are valid. I think you should seek therapy/counseling or other outside source to help you figure this out.", "YTA. You are married, this decision will alter his life too. There are also many things that could happen during the course of pregnancy. Not to be so down, but I almost didn't make it with my second child and there was no way we would have more after that. I understand that you want to help your friend, but I don't think you actually understand what this will entail for you and your husband. Not to mention, your husband, if he stays with you, will have to see a child that's biologically yours and someone else's. Think of how he'll feel about that. Yes, ultimately, it's your body, but don't expect your husband to stick around for this.", "YTA. If I was your husband I'll be seeing a lawyer first thing in the morning", "lol, it\u2019s your body?

He will need to support you through a pregnancy.  If you get sick or have a high risk pregnancy, he will need to pick up the slack in your lives. This affects him too.\n\nYou are so caught up in the promise you made to your friend, you haven't considered what being pregnant actually entails. \n\nYTA", "If you do this, he may leave you, and it won\u2019t make him the bad guy.", "YTA.

You belong to each other .  Not to your friend or her husband.  What are you thinking?  Do his feelings not matter?  Are they more important than your friends?

If you\u2019ve never had a live birth it\u2019s going to be nearly impossible for this to be done in an actual clinic and you will still have to go through the entire adoption process after the pregnancy. \n\nNot to mention that the postpartum recovery period your partner would also have to deal with and the fact that you\u2019ve never given birth before and would be adopting this child out would put you at far greater risk for postpartum depression and psychosis.", "YTA. That is a serious boundary violation. What is wrong with you?", "YTA\n\nYou are married and completely cutting your husband out of a MASSIVE decision about your future.\n\nAnd what you're suggesting ... I can see how it's a kind and noble gesture, but you are very naive if you think you can carry a baby that is yours, your first ever child, and then hand it over and watch them raise your child without wanting to be involved, or them cutting you out for fear of you feeling that way. However close you are now, pregnancy and children change EVERYTHING. They literally change your DNA. There's a very good reason surrogates don't carry their own genetic children, and why they are only surrogates after having already had their own children.\n\nAnd I wouldn't blame your husband for leaving you if you follow through on this idea. You're being incredibly selfish here, and completely disregarding your marriage. Stop and actually think about what you're suggesting.", "YTA, totally\nIf you were single then you could say \"my body my choice\" all day and not worry about it.

Being partners means making BIG decisions together. \n\nI would say the compromise is asking your friends to wait. \n\nSeriously, it's not condescending or judgemental that all these women are advising against it. It's not to stop the selfless act or stop your friends from receiving the gift. \n\nIt's the experience. \n\nIf you never wanted your own children and hadn't been planning for them, my advice would be different.

The first time you will endure the labor, and see your body change - and it will change forever. The first time you will feel the milk come in meant to feed your child. And then you will go home empty. \n\nWhen you want to be a mother you bond with the baby in the womb. You notice the personality and all that. I would absolutely surrogate for another close friend or relative now, but I had my kids and I am done. Don't want to start over when my grandson is 8.

You will likely wish to push the timeline for your own children up, you will likely hit major depression. The effects of pregnancy don't just stop after the baby is born. The child will be a part of you, when they are born you will see yourself in them. \n\nYour friends can find other options if they don't wish to wait, but truly have your children and family first then decide if you have what it takes. \n\nThe promise to your friend was made without all the information.

I had a very easy, quick, unmedicated (GET THE EPIDURAL LADIES I DIDNT TWICE AND DAMN) vaginal birth. Like 15 minutes of pushing, i cannot stress enough how lucky I was to have easy labours with my kids. That being said, I very well almost died. I lost just over a litre of blood before they managed to slow my bleeding down. I had 3 tears, one requiring stitches, I had a surgeon reaching into my vagina to pull out blood clots while a midwife pushed on my stomach, I very nearly needed surgery to stop the bleeding. My partner had to sit there and watch helplessly while he grappled with the idea of going home to our 2 year old and telling him mums not coming back.  \n\nI can't have another baby unless I want to risk bleeding to death for real. This absolutely affects your husband, things can go wrong in an instant during labour and you just never know. \n\n\nThis is all ignoring how hard pregnancy actually is on its own, and you can end up with things that with have you on bed rest your entire pregnancy. HG is a common condition that has many women on IV fluids because they can't eat anything without throwing up for months. I had gestational diabetes in my first pregnancy and that was terrible aswell. All to say, even if you offered me a billion dollars, I couldn't handle being pregnant if I wasn't getting a baby at the end of it. You might do it once and decide you'll never do it again. You might not be able to do it again. You could end up with severe post partum depression/anxiety/psychosis. \n\n\nHonestly, there's no way any doctor would LET you do this anyway, as you don't have your own kids. And to be fair, before I had babies I thought I could be a surrogate if I had to, but I now know that the second I meet the baby I grew I never want to let them go. Reality is, you don't know how you would feel/react when you meet your child, and why risk all of that heartache. \n\nDonate the eggs, but don't entertain the idea of being a surrogate", "YTA.

I think of her like a sister. Due to health conditions, she has always known that conception would be difficult for her. It is very unfair, and we\u2019ve many discussions about it. Around the time we were in high school or college, I offered to one day donate my eggs to her if she is unable to conceive naturally. This was not something I forced upon her, nor did she pressure me to offer this. It has been a mutual discussion we\u2019ve circled back to every few years, and we\u2019re very much on the same page. I trust she would make an amazing mother and I would be able to have an aunt-like relationship with her children. \r  \n\r  \nFlash forward to the present day, and we are both now married. Me and my husband (27M) do not have kids, and are not planning to have kids until mid-30s when we have more money and a nice house. She and her husband (28M) have been married two years and are looking into family planning. As she has gone through testing, it seems she is unable to conceive or carry a child at all. So, if they were to have a baby, they would need both an egg donation and a surrogate. A surrogate can be very expensive, and so she asked me the other day my honest thoughts on taking on that role (This would basically mean I\u2019d skip egg retrieval and just receive artificial insemination, and then carry the baby). I said I\u2019d like to think about it, and she respected my answer. \r  \n\r  \nA couple evenings later, I told my husband about the situation and how I was still mulling it over. He got upset and said he wasn\u2019t comfortable with me carrying another man\u2019s baby, especially before his own. His tone came across as accusatory, and I reminded him that this was entirely clinical and that thousands of women donate eggs and are surrogates, but he said that this wasn\u2019t about the medical procedure, it was something we both had to live with for nine months. He felt that this was not something I should be allowed to decide without consulting him, since pregnancy would involve him as well (supporting me through the journey, helping me around the house etc.). He also said he would feel weird seeing me pregnant with another man\u2019s baby and he wasn\u2019t sure if he could see me the same if I went through with it. After some back and forth, he told me firmly that I could only have my friends baby if we could unanimously agree on it, and that he would never agree. \r  \n\r  \nI understand his points, but I also think that at the end of the day it is my body. And this has been something I\u2019ve discussed with my friend since before either of us even met our husbands, so it feels like I should still be allowed to make this decision on my own, even if that decision is no. \r  \n\r  \n(FYI: He and I have discussed donating my eggs to my friend before, and he never seemed to mind that, but I also don\u2019t know how seriously he took the conversation).\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not to mention the fact that it\u2019s completely reasonable for your husband to not be ok with you carrying another man\u2019s baby BEFORE YOUVE EVEN HAD YOUR OWN children, which is something you\u2019ve agreed you want in the future. In his mind, having a baby with him doesn\u2019t carry the same meaningful weight that it does to you, since you\u2019re willing to have your first child with another man.

You're signing so much away when you accept a pregnancy.\n\nI mean, to be fair, I think a big reason for that is because society has been deliberately romanticizing pregnancy and childbirth for centuries now. Unless you end up on childfree sides of the Internet, or hearing horror stories about awful pregnancies/labors, women and girls don't really hear that much about those potential long-term consequences and risks. Society puts so much emphasis on the whole, \"Woman have uterus, therefore woman should have babies\" and \"Pregancy/childbirth is beautiful and magical!\" shticks that the objective fact that pregnancy and childbirth are both major, life-threatening medical procedures with major, life-threatening medical risks and potential aftereffects gets completely sidelined. \n\nLike, according to CDC records, and even including homicide, suicide, and \"unintentional injuries\", complications from pregnancy and childbirth are still one of the Top 10 causes of death for women of all ethnicities between the ages of 20 and 44. And in my experience, that's something that most people, including doctors and other women/mothers, just gloss right over when talking about pregnancy and childbirth.", "Yeah, that's more or less my point.

Will they pay for your hospital bills?\nB.  This will have a major impact on not just you but your husbands life.  This will be more then 9 months when you consider prep time and recovery.  Both of your lives will be on hold for a year.  There could be medical costs, clothing and food costs?  You could die or be rendered infertile.

Yeah you made the promise, about 10 years ago and it was just for an egg donation.  Now you are married and offering to be a full surrogate which is more then the promise.

While he has always supported my life choices professionally (and he has, more than anyone could ever ask for) he did not *personally* feel he could parent a child that wasn\u2019t his, especially if they were difficult and in need of special care. \n\nWhen we were younger it really bothered me, but I also never pushed to move forward with it because I didn\u2019t want to bring a child who already wasn\u2019t wanted/able to be cared for by their bio parents into a house where they may feel the same way (my husband isn\u2019t an ass but also if he knew he wasn\u2019t all in, it would be apparent in the end). \n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older I still want to do the same but also have more empathy for my husband and don\u2019t look down on him for his decision not to.  He literally said something to me in truth his truth that he feels ashamed about in relation to the work I\u2019ve done and while at the end of the day I know his heart and feel he would be amazing in the role he doesn\u2019t feel he would be good enough for it and his fears about not being all in is why he said he didn\u2019t want to and honestly I respect the fuck out of him for being willing to say it when it would have been so much easier for him mentally just to go along with it even tho he didn\u2019t want to. \n\nI know that\u2019s a word salad and a bit of a jumble but; I\u2019m glad he was honest with me about his true feelings on a matter that was important to me and glad I didn\u2019t move forward and potentially subject innocent kids to a less than inviting and welcome environment.", "I'd like to add the possibility of lasting post partum depression.

My second was way different.  Everything is okay, but my husband says no way he wants me carrying any more babies, whether it's for us or anyone else, because he's seen how rough it's been on me the last time. \n\nI wouldn't do it without my husband being on board.

PPD/PPA happens way more than many people realise, and the hormone shift after labour is ROUGH.

I doubt the husband would care about her donating eggs which I\u2019d see as relatively equivalent but still more invasive. \n\nDonating sperm is an hour long devotion in your day. Surrogacy is pre-counseling and doctor visits, a procedure, 10 months of pregnancy and ongoing doctor visits, feeling unwell, hormonal changes, reduced sharing of household chores and increased spousal support, potentially lethal, lifetime body changes including the potential of never carrying another child, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s mind boggling this is something someone in a partnership thinks they can choose to do on their own and stay in that partnership.", "It's like saying \"my body my choice!\" to starting a meth habit.", "I\u2019m a woman and I know what toll pregnancy takes. She is AH to do this to her husband. She will essentially be dropping the ball on participating in the marriage with no benefit to him.", "Yeah, that part of the conversation stuck out for me too.

It's just not a thing you can unilaterally decide for yourself when it effects so many different avenues.\n\nI also love my child and get the joy of being her mother each and every day so it feels worth it.

I need to sort out a dentist appointment because a piece of one of my molars just flaked off during the last weeks of my pregnancy. I had to take iron tablets because I developed anaemia and was exhausted, and then those made me constipated so I had to sit on the loo for 20-odd minutes trying to poo.  I chose to have a c-section and literally shuffled around the house for the first few weeks because I couldn't lift my feet up high enough to walk properly.\n\nOh and I miscarried my first two pregnancies and ended up in hospital both times because I had really bad bleeds. On the upside this meant that when I had my c-section they were expecting me to haemorrhage and gave me clotting medication at the first hint of excessive bleeding, so I actually lost less blood than you normally would in a c-section.\n\nI can't imagine how much worse it would have been if I'd been lying in hospital with that first miscarriage, thinking \"am I going to bleed to death?\", for someone elses baby. And then having to face them and tell them that I'd miscarried? I'm not sure I'd be willing to give them a 2nd chance, I certainly wouldn't risk a 3rd go for them, it was touch and go enough having a 3rd go for myself!", "I was so sick from day one through to the day I gave birth.

And I had an almost complication-free pregnancy and labour. \n\nOP is definitely exceptionally naive.

There's a vast difference between carrying a baby for someone and making your own baby to give it to someone.\n\nThat being said, it is exceedingly rare that someone needs both a surrogate and an egg donor.

Even easy pregnancies are so hard.\n\nIf you were properly compensating a surrogate (by that I mean, make her as whole as possible with money, such as, hiring a baby sitter for her older kids to make up for her energy levels, higher grocery bills, medical appointments, maternity clothes, etc) it should run you mid five figure USD, if not more.", "The one where OP gets to unilaterally make massive life choices impacting both partners.", "Yeah, HIS boundaries.
