My daughter is super outgoing and friendly, she\u2019s very universally liked wherever she goes and I love that about her.\n\nWe moved to this town when she was entering 7th grade and the school guidance office kinda \u201cset her up\u201d with this other girl who was also new so that they could navigate the school together. I\u2019ll call this girl Emma. I really liked the idea of Emma and Kyra being friends but I quickly realized that Emma was holding her back in a lot of ways. When Kyra began branching out and making new friends Emma got very clingy and tried to stop her.\n\nShe\u2019s constantly putting pressure on Kyra to help her with her mental health and essentially her free therapist but never helps Ky in return. Even when Ky was admitted to the hospital she showed up to tell her how she \u201ccouldn\u2019t survive at school without her\u201d and she had to come back as soon as possible. Not one question or care about how she was doing. Our new foster daughter is in the same grade as them and she says that no one in their grade tolerates Emma except for Ky and she is way too patient with her.\n\nI feel bad for Emma as I was a socially awkward kid too but I think she\u2019s taking it way too far. Kyra has started trying to slowly drift away from Emma but it\u2019s hard because she follows her everywhere. She even tried out for the volleyball club that Emma goes to so they could be on the team together.\n\nWell for Ky\u2019s birthday we decided that we could take 3 of her friends to Disney with her for a special weekend. She decided to take her foster sister, her very close friend from volleyball and one of her other close school friends.I told her to just not mention it to Emma or anyone who wasn\u2019t invited because she has a lot of friends and didn\u2019t want to make anyone feel left out.\n\nWell Emma found out from practically interrogating her and I had told her that if she did to just blame me. Well she did and I got a very angry call from Emma\u2019s mother. I said that I only allowed her to bring 3 people and I wanted her to bring those three because she\u2019s known them for much longer(which isn\u2019t necessarily true but she didn\u2019t know that) she said that Emma invited Kyra to her birthday which was also very small and the two of them are \u201cbest friends\u201d despite not knowing eachother very long and I shouldn\u2019t control who my kids are friends with.\n\nI tried to put as gently as possible that I and my other kids have noticed whenever Emma is over at our house she is not nice to Kyra and makes us uncomfortable and she freaked out and said I\u2019m bullying a child and said she could file and HIB at our school for this. She said she works for a school district and she knows exactly how to get a kid thrown out. She then said she\u2019d pay for Emma to go or pay for a bigger room for everyone but I flat out said no and hung up on her.I feel like an AH now because I might\u2019ve ruined their friendship and Kyra is furious with me plus I was a little harsh.

Emma\u2019s mom is not doing Emma any favors by making others responsible for her daughter\u2019s happiness.

Emma\u2018s mom should understand.", "This is absolutely a NTA. You saw Emma was holding your daughter back and decided to take action and allow her to use her full potential. I genuinely don\u2019t get what\u2019s wrong about this. And Emma should probably seek a professional therapist/ guidance counselor.

Perhaps the school has a counseling service for Emma since she is still struggling.\n\nTalk to Kyra about having an additional, more modest celebration and invite Emma plus others in addition to the Disney trip.  I suspect Kyra is upset with you because she does not want the drama caused by Emma's mother.", "NTA from what I can tell. However I may be biased as your daughters and Emma\u2019s friendship reminds me a lot about how a very toxic and emotionally abusive friendship I was in around that age. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s an abusive relationship rn or that it will turn into one, but there are a few red flags in your post alone and I think it\u2019s good that you see those red flags and try to create some distance", "nta.  Your daughter made her 3 pick without including Emma.  End of story. I actually feel really bad for Emma after you described her mother's behavior.", "NTA and you need to make 2 phone calls, one to your daughter\u2019s school and one to the district Emma\u2019s mom works for and explain the threats she made. She went from trying to bribe you to trying to blackmail you.", "This woman is threatening to use her position and knowledge to harm your daughter.  That's beyond not okay.  She needs to be reported immediately,  If you have any documentation at all, or any witnesses, use that.  Get some if you can. \n\nIf Emma has real mental health issues then those should be reported as well if you feel her parents are not providing the proper care for her she needs.  This isn't a \"you disagree with care decisions\" type thing, this is a \"they're actively harming or impeding their daughter's improvement\" thing, meaning only do something here if it's crystal clear Emma is suffering.\n\nNeither you nor Kyra owes Emma or her mom anything.  Friendships come and go through life.\n\nNTA.", "If Kyra chose her three invitees freely with no pressure from you, then you are absolutely NTA. The only important question here is how Kyra feels because its her birthday. If she feels guilty she could do something later with Emma, IF she wants to.", "NTA\n\nYour title could use work cause Your own Daughter specifically chose Anyone but Emma for this trip. You had no part in it and you are trying too hard to take the fall to protect your daughter when your daughter is trying her best to slowly cut Emma off on her own without your intervention.

Your daughter gets to choose who she brings with her to Disney. Yes, she should be cordial to Emma (which it sounds like she is), but not every kid has to be best friends with everyone. It does not sound like Kyra is mean at ALL to her and my guess is, Emma's mom is a huge part of why she is the way she is. Her tying to get a 14 Y/O kicked out of school for not being attached at the hip with her daughter makes her a giant a-hole, not you.

You may think you're protecting your daughter, when in all reality you're setting her up for a very uncomfortable future with this girl. Kyra also needs to learn how to stand up to herself as she is literally being bullied into a friendship she doesn't want.", "NTA Emma's happiness doesn't matter more than your daughter's. Your daughter is unhappy with this forced friendship, and she should be allowed to break away from it. The other mom's just confirms it's not safe to associate with these people at all anymore. Report the other mom's threat, get a lawyer, do whatever you have to do, but it's time to end all relationships with this family.", "NTA. Emma\u2019s mom ruined the relationship with her threats and desperation. That would creep me out", "This is such a confusing story.\n\nWhy did you tell your daughter to keep it  quiet?  It is not like all the invited people are gonna keep it quiet that they are going or went to Disneyland.\n\nThis is such a weird way....", "Oof this is so tough... on the one hand I can see you protecting your daughter,  but on the other I can see why Kyra and Emma's mom are upset. \n\nNAH because I think Emma just needs help. She's 14 and kids are meant to make mistakes. And I think you're just doing your best to make sure your kid is okay... which I don't blame you for, but so is Emma's mom for her. This could potentially make things a bad situation for Kyra at school too, just out of bad luck. Yes maybe the way you acted was harsh, but I wouldn't call you an AH for it, because your intentions are good. \n\nGood luck OP. This just seems like a really unfortunate situation.", "NTA contact the school immediately and let them know what's going on. If they share classes I'd ask for them to be have new seating arrangements if they cannot switch classrooms", "So, you let her choose 2 friends. Why wasn't the foster sister a given? Would you have let that child stay home if your daughter hadn't picked her? I hope the foster sister lives with your ex or something and not with you. YTA for that.", "YTA. I had to fkn stop half way thru but all this is worded like Emma is an adult who understands her manipulation.\n\nSure, force her away from Kyra and let poor Emma go into a breakdown...\n\nYikes.", "ESH (you and Emma's mother). Stop trying to regulate their friendship and focus on what Kyra actually asks of you. Kyra chose three friends, and then you lied to Emma's mother telling her this \"she knows them longer\" nonsense. If Kyra wants to drift away from Emma as a friend then it needs to happen naturally, not through you encouraging it.", "I think we found out what Emma\u2019s problem is\u2026her mother.

NTA", "NTA, and Emma\u2019s mum SHOULD be reported to HER school district based on her behaviour alone. Her daughter is so bad for yours.", "Oh sorry I forgot to clarify, they\u2019re 8th graders which is still very young. I have confidence Emma will become better at social situations as she gets older but Ky is very young too and it\u2019s just a lot to manage having such a high maintenance friend.", "Exactly.  If someone who works for the school district is using that to threaten to kick your kid out as blackmail so that your daughter will be friends with hers that is something they need to know about ASAP.", "The school wants this arrangement so they can put the burden of handling this girl on an unpaid student.", "Also, it's not safe to maintain any sort of friendship with the daughter now that the mom is making threats. When someone makes threats, that's a confirmation you need to sever ties, not placate the person.", "I forgot to add the part when Kyra came home and asked me if I would let Emma just come and have 5 people instead of 4. I just refused and she said she was only asking to not cause drama.", "I just told her not to go out of her way to tell people who weren\u2019t invited because in my opinion it\u2019s rude.

I have 5 kids, and my foster daughter didn\u2019t invite her to hers. The two of them have gotten much closer since then and I knew she would. I also don\u2019t have an ex ?", "I seriously don\u2019t think she knows how manipulative she is because she\u2019s a young kid but so is Kyra and it shouldn\u2019t be her responsibility to let Emma completely drain her emotionally. In my opinion she needs a therapist and possibly group therapy with other kids her age but that\u2019s not my say since I\u2019m not her parent. I\u2019m here to advocate for the mental health of my own kid and Emma has done nothing but harm that.", "Why should Kyra be responsible for Emma\u2019s mental health? Letting Emma continue to bully and manipulate Kyra just teaches Kyra how to be abused. Kyra is not responsible for Emma and while it\u2019s clear Emma is troubled letting her abuse others is not the answer. She needs help and not from another 14 yo.", "Are you actually implying that a child be forced to continue to be around another child who bullies her?", "OP\u2019s only priority needs to be what\u2019s in Kyra\u2019s best interests. And having to endure Emma isn\u2019t.", "Did you not read the story, Kyra is trying to drift away from Emma, but can\u2019t because she follows her everywhere. Emma just doesn\u2019t seem like that good of a friend, visited Ky in the hospital and could only talk about how EMMA can\u2019t survive without her, not a single question about how she\u2019s doing. Who does that?", "I feel like late 8th grade is when that switch over starts. \n\nMom can help Emma have a growth mindset about her social skills leading to successful adult relationships. \n\nOr she can not \u2026leaving Emma to figure it out on her own with uncertain success.\n\nEither way: you guys are still NTA", "When someone makes threats, that's the time to immediately cut all contact with them. \n\nYour kid shouldn't be having any contact with the other kid, if her mother is ok with making threats that put your kids education at jeporday.", "Just to be clear she doesn\u2019t work for our school district, she works for some other one that\u2019s pretty far away but she knows how this sort of thing works so she definitely would have the upper hand.", "Does not change what I said at all.\n\nYou jumped from the door to throw yourself under the bus. It's noble and great of you, but It's obvious that Kyra is trying to distance from Emma on her own... Even with your addition to this, her just backing down from the request and saying nothin more speaks a lot for itself.\n\nYou should have let Kyra try to handle this on her own with your help, then give her the permission and ability to direct the issue to you to handle.\n\nI've been on both sides of this \"toxic friend\" coin, it's not easy to drop crappy/toxic friends and as the person who has been the crappy/toxic friend, I've done my most to try to hold on to people I should not have. It doesn't make it easier when you have someone directly enabling the behavior. You and your daughter have a long road ahead, it's not gonna be easy, but it will be necessary for your daughter's peace and happiness.", "yeah, I think that's pretty normal.\n\nthat said- given that Emma's said basically threatened your daughter- via her education- I'd reach out to the school (or the school district) with a heads up about the issue. Emma's mom is a district employee and her behavior wasn't okay.", "Huh what age are we all talking about. This is such a confusing way to celebrate birthdays from your kids and foster daughter", "\u201cI never require my kids to bring each other to their parties\u201d\n\nWtf kind of alienation is that ??\n\nYou want them not to treat each other as siblings and as acquaintances instead ?", "It's not your daughter's responsibility but it is your responsibility as somebody in the community close to Emma to make sure she's treated with the help and respect she deserves.\n\nTake the fair judgment for what it is.", "Nope. Nobody asked about the kid... just the parent.", "Ok, and she still can be an ass doing so. That's life", "Of course I read it, I guess you missed the part where OP's call made Kyra upset. Again, if Emma is not a good friend and Kyra wants to distance herself, then she needs to address the problem herself. Parental meddling is not going to help here.", "You definitely need to talk to the school and work out a way for them to keep this kid away from yours indefinitely. Or until your child is ready to have a relationship with her, if she wants one. \n\nShe is obsessed with your kid. She can't even get time alone to breathe, let alone think. \n\nThis girl is damaging her mental and emotional health. She's tearing her down so that she will for sure stay with her and your daughter won't have any other friends hut her. \n\nYour daughter is in an abusive friendship and you need to do everything you can to get her out ofnit. \n\nThis gilr is damaging your daughters mental health, dont wait. Talk to the school and separate this girl from your kid, before this girl gets more abusive with her.", "Doesn't really matter usually people know each other... Just saying", "\nI would have laughed in that moms face and told her that the kids were nowhere near best friends. Her daughter is just obsessed and your kid can't stand her. \n\nI mean she was literally in the hospital and the kid only cam to complain about how lonely she is.\n\nThis kid isn't good for your kid.", "Well my kids as they get older typically prefer to have parties with a smaller group of friends than a big party. So I obviously am not going to require all their siblings come along. My foster daughters birthday was like 3 weeks after she moved in and it was just a hangout with kids from her old school. It\u2019s not up to me at all, I\u2019m just the wallet lol.", "Oh sorry I didn\u2019t see the first part. I mean like at the elementary school our kids go to they require the whole class to be invited if you\u2019re having a party in which case all the siblings are invited as well but if it\u2019s just a small get together they can invite whoever they want and usually after like age 12 that\u2019s what they want.", "They are siblings what? They spend all their time at home together. They love eachother and get along great. But they also have friends. We go on family vacations and excursions all the time(we\u2019re currently on one). Their birthday is their special day to invite whoever they want and especially if it\u2019s a cool trip like Disney then they\u2019d rather go with good friends than their siblings who\u2019ve they\u2019ve already been with 10 times.", "Even if siblings are doing just fine together, it doesn't mean they want to spent their birthdays with each other. I wouldn't want my brother on my birthday party and he wouldn't want me on his and it was like that even when we were kids. We want to celebrate with our respective friends.", "My sister and I didn't go to each other's parties that weren't at the house.  It wasn't alienation at all.  Heck, even when they were at the house we tended to avoid the event, because it was the other person's event, not ours.  We didn't share friend groups or even social circles really despite living in the same house and going to the same school.\n\nI've found that it's much more frequent that parents that force siblings to always do things together raise kids that hate them for it and have strained relationships with each other.", "Agreed, this is just odd.", "I accept the judgement but the reasoning is a little weird. Judging on how Emma\u2019s mom reacted to me saying one thing Emma did wrong I don\u2019t think she would be psyched at me suggesting her kid has actual issues and needs therapy. Also I\u2019m not close to Emma, I hear about her from my kids and greet her when she\u2019s at our house and that\u2019s about it. Occasionally I talk to her when I drive them places. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be considered any type of guardian figure.", "Speaking as the \"behavior buffer\" for too many kids in elementary and middle school, please see if you can separate the two in different classes or in the seating charts. Being the \"good kid\" was terrible for my social development and eventually my self-esteem from never feeling like I could say \"no\" to someone being my \"friend.\"", "This. Biological siblings need space too so why should non-biological siblings not need space? And birthdays are pretty personal too.", "Y\u2019all are all fckn weird , I grew up with two siblings and when it was one of our birthdays ya friends are invited but your sibling is there too", "Oh nothing's weird about it. All it takes is a bit of extra empathy and selflessness past the immediate situation. Tbh I wouldn't care about what Emma's mom thing, because she may very well be the reason Emma is like this. Or maybe she cares and needs an intervention to help her daughter.\n\nEither way, you cutting it off so abruptly and overtly will most likely lead to problems for Emma that very well will fall back on Kyra. The scorn and resentment of an unwell person is not something to overlook.\n\nYou may claim it's not your place or problem, but it is considering how much of the mind Emma has put into Kyra. Emma's problems are becoming Kyra's problem so now you'e invovled.", "Two siblings is different than 4, plus 2 foster siblings so 6. I don\u2019t have the money to pay for a whole family vacation for us plus her friends so should I just not let her do what she wants because her siblings wouldn\u2019t be able to go or make her only take siblings and no friends? Every family is different, it\u2019s not weird."]}
