My daughter is super outgoing and friendly, she\u2019s very universally liked wherever she goes and I love that about her.\n\nWe moved to this town when she was entering 7th grade and the school guidance office kinda \u201cset her up\u201d with this other girl who was also new so that they could navigate the school together. I\u2019ll call this girl Emma. I really liked the idea of Emma and Kyra being friends but I quickly realized that Emma was holding her back in a lot of ways. When Kyra began branching out and making new friends Emma got very clingy and tried to stop her.\n\nShe\u2019s constantly putting pressure on Kyra to help her with her mental health and essentially her free therapist but never helps Ky in return. Even when Ky was admitted to the hospital she showed up to tell her how she \u201ccouldn\u2019t survive at school without her\u201d and she had to come back as soon as possible. Not one question or care about how she was doing. Our new foster daughter is in the same grade as them and she says that no one in their grade tolerates Emma except for Ky and she is way too patient with her.\n\nI feel bad for Emma as I was a socially awkward kid too but I think she\u2019s taking it way too far. Kyra has started trying to slowly drift away from Emma but it\u2019s hard because she follows her everywhere. She even tried out for the volleyball club that Emma goes to so they could be on the team together.\n\nWell for Ky\u2019s birthday we decided that we could take 3 of her friends to Disney with her for a special weekend. She decided to take her foster sister, her very close friend from volleyball and one of her other close school friends.I told her to just not mention it to Emma or anyone who wasn\u2019t invited because she has a lot of friends and didn\u2019t want to make anyone feel left out.\n\nWell Emma found out from practically interrogating her and I had told her that if she did to just blame me. Well she did and I got a very angry call from Emma\u2019s mother. I said that I only allowed her to bring 3 people and I wanted her to bring those three because she\u2019s known them for much longer(which isn\u2019t necessarily true but she didn\u2019t know that) she said that Emma invited Kyra to her birthday which was also very small and the two of them are \u201cbest friends\u201d despite not knowing eachother very long and I shouldn\u2019t control who my kids are friends with.\n\nI tried to put as gently as possible that I and my other kids have noticed whenever Emma is over at our house she is not nice to Kyra and makes us uncomfortable and she freaked out and said I\u2019m bullying a child and said she could file and HIB at our school for this. She said she works for a school district and she knows exactly how to get a kid thrown out. She then said she\u2019d pay for Emma to go or pay for a bigger room for everyone but I flat out said no and hung up on her.I feel like an AH now because I might\u2019ve ruined their friendship and Kyra is furious with me plus I was a little harsh.

Perhaps the school has a counseling service for Emma since she is still struggling.\n\nTalk to Kyra about having an additional, more modest celebration and invite Emma plus others in addition to the Disney trip.  I suspect Kyra is upset with you because she does not want the drama caused by Emma's mother.", "NTA from what I can tell.

She went from trying to bribe you to trying to blackmail you.", "This woman is threatening to use her position and knowledge to harm your daughter.  That's beyond not okay.  She needs to be reported immediately,  If you have any documentation at all, or any witnesses, use that.  Get some if you can. \n\nIf Emma has real mental health issues then those should be reported as well if you feel her parents are not providing the proper care for her she needs.  This isn't a \"you disagree with care decisions\" type thing, this is a \"they're actively harming or impeding their daughter's improvement\" thing, meaning only do something here if it's crystal clear Emma is suffering.\n\nNeither you nor Kyra owes Emma or her mom anything.  Friendships come and go through life.\n\nNTA.", "If Kyra chose her three invitees freely with no pressure from you, then you are absolutely NTA.

You had no part in it and you are trying too hard to take the fall to protect your daughter when your daughter is trying her best to slowly cut Emma off on her own without your intervention.

Your daughter gets to choose who she brings with her to Disney. Yes, she should be cordial to Emma (which it sounds like she is), but not every kid has to be best friends with everyone. It does not sound like Kyra is mean at ALL to her and my guess is, Emma's mom is a huge part of why she is the way she is. Her tying to get a 14 Y/O kicked out of school for not being attached at the hip with her daughter makes her a giant a-hole, not you.

Kyra also needs to learn how to stand up to herself as she is literally being bullied into a friendship she doesn't want.", "NTA Emma's happiness doesn't matter more than your daughter's. Your daughter is unhappy with this forced friendship, and she should be allowed to break away from it.

Emma\u2019s mom ruined the relationship with her threats and desperation. That would creep me out", "This is such a confusing story.\n\nWhy did you tell your daughter to keep it  quiet?  It is not like all the invited people are gonna keep it quiet that they are going or went to Disneyland.\n\nThis is such a weird way....", "Oof this is so tough... on the one hand I can see you protecting your daughter,  but on the other I can see why Kyra and Emma's mom are upset. \n\nNAH because I think Emma just needs help. She's 14 and kids are meant to make mistakes. And I think you're just doing your best to make sure your kid is okay... which I don't blame you for, but so is Emma's mom for her. This could potentially make things a bad situation for Kyra at school too, just out of bad luck. Yes maybe the way you acted was harsh, but I wouldn't call you an AH for it, because your intentions are good. \n\nGood luck OP.

If they share classes I'd ask for them to be have new seating arrangements if they cannot switch classrooms", "So, you let her choose 2 friends. Why wasn't the foster sister a given?

Stop trying to regulate their friendship and focus on what Kyra actually asks of you. Kyra chose three friends, and then you lied to Emma's mother telling her this \"she knows them longer\" nonsense.

If someone who works for the school district is using that to threaten to kick your kid out as blackmail so that your daughter will be friends with hers that is something they need to know about ASAP.", "The school wants this arrangement so they can put the burden of handling this girl on an unpaid student.", "Also, it's not safe to maintain any sort of friendship with the daughter now that the mom is making threats.

I also don\u2019t have an ex ?", "I seriously don\u2019t think she knows how manipulative she is because she\u2019s a young kid but so is Kyra and it shouldn\u2019t be her responsibility to let Emma completely drain her emotionally. In my opinion she needs a therapist and possibly group therapy with other kids her age but that\u2019s not my say since I\u2019m not her parent. I\u2019m here to advocate for the mental health of my own kid and Emma has done nothing but harm that.", "Why should Kyra be responsible for Emma\u2019s mental health?

It's noble and great of you, but It's obvious that Kyra is trying to distance from Emma on her own... Even with your addition to this, her just backing down from the request and saying nothin more speaks a lot for itself.\n\nYou should have let Kyra try to handle this on her own with your help, then give her the permission and ability to direct the issue to you to handle.\n\nI've been on both sides of this \"toxic friend\" coin, it's not easy to drop crappy/toxic friends and as the person who has been the crappy/toxic friend, I've done my most to try to hold on to people I should not have. It doesn't make it easier when you have someone directly enabling the behavior. You and your daughter have a long road ahead, it's not gonna be easy, but it will be necessary for your daughter's peace and happiness.", "yeah, I think that's pretty normal.\n\nthat said- given that Emma's said basically threatened your daughter- via her education- I'd reach out to the school (or the school district) with a heads up about the issue. Emma's mom is a district employee and her behavior wasn't okay.", "Huh what age are we all talking about. This is such a confusing way to celebrate birthdays from your kids and foster daughter", "[deleted]", "It's not your daughter's responsibility but it is your responsibility as somebody in the community close to Emma to make sure she's treated with the help and respect she deserves.\n\nTake the fair judgment for what it is.", "Nope. Nobody asked about the kid... just the parent.", "Ok, and she still can be an ass doing so. That's life", "Of course I read it, I guess you missed the part where OP's call made Kyra upset. Again, if Emma is not a good friend and Kyra wants to distance herself, then she needs to address the problem herself. Parental meddling is not going to help here.", "You definitely need to talk to the school and work out a way for them to keep this kid away from yours indefinitely. Or until your child is ready to have a relationship with her, if she wants one. \n\nShe is obsessed with your kid. She can't even get time alone to breathe, let alone think. \n\nThis girl is damaging her mental and emotional health. She's tearing her down so that she will for sure stay with her and your daughter won't have any other friends hut her. \n\nYour daughter is in an abusive friendship and you need to do everything you can to get her out ofnit. \n\nThis gilr is damaging your daughters mental health, dont wait. Talk to the school and separate this girl from your kid, before this girl gets more abusive with her.", "Doesn't really matter usually people know each other... Just saying", "\nI would have laughed in that moms face and told her that the kids were nowhere near best friends. Her daughter is just obsessed and your kid can't stand her. \n\nI mean she was literally in the hospital and the kid only cam to complain about how lonely she is.\n\nThis kid isn't good for your kid.", "Well my kids as they get older typically prefer to have parties with a smaller group of friends than a big party. So I obviously am not going to require all their siblings come along. My foster daughters birthday was like 3 weeks after she moved in and it was just a hangout with kids from her old school. It\u2019s not up to me at all, I\u2019m just the wallet lol.", "Oh sorry I didn\u2019t see the first part. I mean like at the elementary school our kids go to they require the whole class to be invited if you\u2019re having a party in which case all the siblings are invited as well but if it\u2019s just a small get together they can invite whoever they want and usually after like age 12 that\u2019s what they want.", "They are siblings what? They spend all their time at home together. They love eachother and get along great. But they also have friends. We go on family vacations and excursions all the time(we\u2019re currently on one). Their birthday is their special day to invite whoever they want and especially if it\u2019s a cool trip like Disney then they\u2019d rather go with good friends than their siblings who\u2019ve they\u2019ve already been with 10 times.", "Even if siblings are doing just fine together, it doesn't mean they want to spent their birthdays with each other. I wouldn't want my brother on my birthday party and he wouldn't want me on his and it was like that even when we were kids. We want to celebrate with our respective friends.", "My sister and I didn't go to each other's parties that weren't at the house.  It wasn't alienation at all.  Heck, even when they were at the house we tended to avoid the event, because it was the other person's event, not ours.  We didn't share friend groups or even social circles really despite living in the same house and going to the same school.\n\nI've found that it's much more frequent that parents that force siblings to always do things together raise kids that hate them for it and have strained relationships with each other.", "Agreed, this is just odd.", "I accept the judgement but the reasoning is a little weird. Judging on how Emma\u2019s mom reacted to me saying one thing Emma did wrong I don\u2019t think she would be psyched at me suggesting her kid has actual issues and needs therapy. Also I\u2019m not close to Emma, I hear about her from my kids and greet her when she\u2019s at our house and that\u2019s about it. Occasionally I talk to her when I drive them places. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be considered any type of guardian figure.", "Speaking as the \"behavior buffer\" for too many kids in elementary and middle school, please see if you can separate the two in different classes or in the seating charts. Being the \"good kid\" was terrible for my social development and eventually my self-esteem from never feeling like I could say \"no\" to someone being my \"friend.\"", "This. Biological siblings need space too so why should non-biological siblings not need space? And birthdays are pretty personal too.", "[deleted]", "Oh nothing's weird about it. All it takes is a bit of extra empathy and selflessness past the immediate situation. Tbh I wouldn't care about what Emma's mom thing, because she may very well be the reason Emma is like this. Or maybe she cares and needs an intervention to help her daughter.\n\nEither way, you cutting it off so abruptly and overtly will most likely lead to problems for Emma that very well will fall back on Kyra. The scorn and resentment of an unwell person is not something to overlook.\n\nYou may claim it's not your place or problem, but it is considering how much of the mind Emma has put into Kyra. Emma's problems are becoming Kyra's problem so now you'e invovled.", "Two siblings is different than 4, plus 2 foster siblings so 6. I don\u2019t have the money to pay for a whole family vacation for us plus her friends so should I just not let her do what she wants because her siblings wouldn\u2019t be able to go or make her only take siblings and no friends? Every family is different, it\u2019s not weird.", "NTA. PLEASE go and speak to the school about this situation (including the mother\u2019s threats) and start working on solutions to fix this.\nI would also encourage you to explain to Kyra that she shouldn\u2019t communicate with Emma (or as little as possible) in light of these threats.", "NAH. Emma might have\u2026 a crush on your daughter. The excessive mental anguish she always needs help with, social isolation, and obsessive feelings and jealousy when Kyra hangs out with others.

If the whole family isn\u2019t going then never mind.\n\nETA oh then yeah not the AH", "YTA.", "INFO: Why is your foster child counted among three friends you've allowed Ky to invite instead of just being counted as part of your family? Were you going to leave her behind if Ky didn't invite her? Also, as a parent to a teenager, I'm wondering why you are so involved with your daughter's friendships and social life. Why aren't you letting Ky manage her friendships without your interference? She's 14, and this is the age we learn how to handle relationships and interactions with others.", "You need to go to the school and tell them that Emma's mom threatened you. You need to give them the context, what she said, and that she wants to use her position to make it happen. Do not be passive about this. This woman can screw up your daughter's future to be vindictive.", "NTA out of curiosity have you sat down with your daughter to discuss Emma, her behaviour and how she treats your daughter?", "NTA. You need to continue to have your child's back and set firm boundaries. I'd also talk to the school because their attempt to formulate a friendhsip has backfired. \n\nIf Emma's mom would yell at you, imagine what Emma would do to get her way. Sounds like she's already clingy and could manipulate your daughter to get her way.", "NTA. I was like your daughter for many years, and I\u2019ve had a few Emmas in my life. I wish my mom had done for me what you\u2019ve done for Ky.", "NTA that mom is garbage. The fact that she called as if she really had a say. If she starts trying to bully your child handle it.", "NTA. This is very concerning. Emma is having mental health issues and her mother is making everyone else responsible for Emma\u2019s well being instead of addressing the issues. I would preemptively go to the school and explain that Emma is clinging to your daughter in an unearthly way and that her mother is threatening to get her kicked out of your daughter tries to distance herself. It is not bullying to decide to not be friends with someone any more (although that hasn\u2019t even happened-yet). In fact, Emma\u2019s mother is the one behaving like a bully. I had a friend like Emma when I was in school. She had mental health problems and no one else liked her because everything was about her. I was willing to be kind to her, but she didn\u2019t want me to have other friends. My problem was solved because her mother was not as unreasonable as Emma\u2019s and my mother talked to hers about the situation. The girl received counseling and the family ended up moving but it was a very difficult time for me.", "NTA go to the school and tell them about the situation. If all else fails you may just have to lay it out simply to Emma, but that should be a last resort.\n\nReport the threat. I'm sure the school district wouldn't want to be associated by someone willing to openly abuse their power to affect kids.
