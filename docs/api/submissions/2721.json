He was totally OK with you being on your own with the kids back home, but suddenly it's a grave sin to be on your own with the kids in a different hotel, after he made it *clear* to you he was not going to be available for family time no matter what? It's not your fault his work booked  a different hotel. Honestly, as much as I hate to defend corporate overlords, I can't even blame them for booking a cheaper hotel. Sometimes that's just life. These are the kinds of problems a lot of people *want* to have, honestly.", "NTA - You agreed to a week off work and it makes sense for it to be an actual week off for you.  It doesn\u2019t sound as if the accommodation is at all suitable for kids that age. I get where your husband is coming from however the travel would be a pain for you and the kids and it would be great for you to get a break as it is your annual leave after all.", "NTA.  What was proposed by your sister sounds reasonable.  Spell it out to your husband about the extra expense that a rental car and parking at the parks will cost.  Plus, a 2 and 4 year old in a business type hotel with no pool would be a disaster.  I hope you can talk some sense into your husband.", "NTA.

This one is pretty easy. \n\nHe\u2019s on a work trip and will be working late. The other hotel is better for you and the kids. \n\nDisney is already extremely expensive and can be a headache for the parent. No need to add additional stress.

There isn\u2019t anything for the children to do at the hotel and it will cost more. Also he will be really busy working so being with your sister makes more sense.

What you chose to do is practical and does simplify the time for you and the kids. In the same token, having y'all in the room with him when he's done with his work to help him relax and recharge is a benefit to him.\n\nHe is a bit more of TA for going off on the suggestion however and not giving it serious thought.", "NTA because I have lived in Orlando and it can be a real nightmare getting around the attractions area! It really is going to save you a lot of time and hassle. Maybe your husband will understand once you\u2019re there and he sees how not-fun it would\u2019ve been at his hotel.", "He literally said he'd be unavailable most of the time anyway.  You're changing hotels for the kids enjoyment.  I see no problem really. You probably would stay with him if it was kid free, but it isn't.  You're making the best of it!  NTA by any stretch.", "NTA why is it all on his terms? He will be working.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYou should never have butted in on a weeklong work conference to begin with. Who the hell wants to be all day and evening at work functions and then come back to a hotel room to deal with a wife and 2 toddlers?

But he's probably angry that you initially tagged on as if you wanted a family thing and now you're bailing out with your sister.", "Maybe he is upset you decided to have a family vacation with your sister instead of your original plan of being with him at bedtime and in the mornings. Maybe he is upset he will miss the excitement in his kid's faces when they see Disney world for the first time (I'm assuming it their first time) maybe is worried that while he is at work, in those conferences, all he will be thinking about is much fun his family will be having and how much he is missing out.\n\n On the other hand it wouldn't be fair to you and the kids to be trapped in a boring hotel all day. Young kids need to burn energy. Plus it would be easier for him to Uber then you to have to rent a car, carry two car seats, and drag whatever luggage through mco.", "ESH. Did you not ask about the hotel? Did he know and not tell you?", "NTA why should  you be at  home working and looking after the kids full time. Its  your week too. He cant join you, so what.

The days are too long or too much for him, he can go back to the room, FaceTime you guys, and then relax himself.

You are effectively spending money on a really nice vacation for you and the kids that he doesn\u2019t get to enjoy.  He liked the idea at first, because he would have you and the kids at his room or with him when his work day was over.  Now you aren\u2019t even staying in the hotel, so he won\u2019t see you at all until the last day.  So yes, he is frustrated and upset that you are going on a vacation with the kids without him.\n\nMy husband and I spend years in careers where we both had work conferences.  We drew a line early on that no matter where the conference was, it was work, not a vacation for the spouse.  If we wanted a vacation at that site, we would plan it for a separate time where we were together as a family (we had a child), and not part of a work conference because it is distracting.  Both my husband and I would talk about colleagues who would,bring their families to work conferences and it was a huge distraction for those people.  They would do it to save money because the company was paying for the hotel room and the employee\u2019s airline ticket.  One of my work conferences had a policy of no spouses or family allowed, because it was a distraction to the employee.  A lot of productive conversations, meetings, and networking happen outside of the scheduled sessions.\n\nMy husband wasn\u2019t crazy on theme parks, so there times where our son and I would go to the park while hubby hung out at the pool, and the. We would meet back up for lunch or dinner.

He always asks me if we want to tag along. (Aka go on vacation without him.) Because of that my kiddos have experienced AMAZING things. (We also homeschool so that makes things a lot easier when it comes to traveling.)

Could still have the date night with the kids at the cousins for one night.", "How long is the trip? Would it be feasible to spend a day or two in the hotel with your husband, and then go to your sister a couple days before he\u2019s able to come join you all? Maybe the kids can do activities in or near the hotel for a day or so without you having to transport them a half hour away to Disney, and they can spend mornings with dad \u2014 and then the second leg of the trip is the Disney trip with their cousins.", "Couldn't your husband simply move hotels with you?  That way, your daily chores are simplified,  he could uber to his conference and see you daily", "As a workaholic, his reaction tells he wants them there when he\u2019s done for the day to help him keep his mind right.", "He immediately agreed to them coming and they booked the wife and kids plane tickets to join him the same day.

That's not great for a marriage either.", "He\u2019s definitely not in introvert or an over thinker, I think when he agreed to us coming he thought it was just going to be a very simple arrangement and didn\u2019t really expect the amount of planning it takes to travel with toddlers and now he\u2019s feeling left out.", "Seems so odd that he is getting so upset by this, maybe its just the initial reaction to the idea. I hope he calms down and understands why it's best for you and the kids.", "I mean, I think the issue is that he was expecting to have his family there, and now he gets to miss out on that because he has to work. \n\nSince you say he's not a big theme park fan, maybe the solution is that he gets to choose what the next vacation is", "He didn\u2019t ask them to come as it was suppose to be a week long business trip with lots of meetings and meals.

He and OP didn't know he was going to be at a business hotel nowhere near Disney when any of the plans were made. But that doesn't make it any less unsuitable for the plan to go to Disney...

But that's not the case.", "Just because you read the post doesn't mean you understood the post or the events that transpired. It seems you lack the experience to fully comprehend what happened and are just blaming the husband for this situation because OBVIOUSLY he is wrong for, once it was suggested to make it a family trip, actually wanting his family there. You're right. They shouldn't be going and he should suffer in misery for having the audacity for being offended that a trip he was looking forward to with his family was cut to only a single night with his partner at the end of it.\n\nI do hope one day someone opens your eyes to the reality of the world around you and it is not clear cut to what you think it is.\n\nAs a point of reference, my original answer is one from EXPERIENCE in being in this situation before.

Hubby has told everyone how his perfect family will be there, and how he's such a super dad he's paid for them to go Disney while he works, but he'll be super dad every morning at breakfast. My god, he's  a walking hero!\n\nWhere are your kids dude?\nErm....\n\nThis is about him playing a PR point on you going with him and now it won't happen. THAT'S  why he's angry. You just made him look a fool and hurt his career as far as he's concerned. IMHO.", "NTA.", "NTA but you're spending your vacation time and probably your vacation budget to go on a vacation without him. I can see where he's hurt. I also think spending your vacation time in a hotel that's not child friendly isn't fair, either. The problem is that his employer did something different than you assumed they would. It's no one's fault and now you have to find alternate solutions to how to bridge this being both your family vacation and a work trip. You should work together to find ways to include him.", "NTA\n\nThe husband makes no sense...\n\nHe asks for permission thinking he'll be alone on the business trip.\n \nThen he agrees with his family coming, but insists that it is a work trip and that OP will be mostly on their own.\n\nThen he makes a fuss about not having family time!?", "NTA. \nDidn\u2019t he already say you were on your own with the kids?", "Nta\n\nI'm guessing he has never has kids in a hotel without you doing all the work.", "NTA \n\nyour husband sounds a little but hurt that he will miss out on the fun, but he was going to miss out anyway", "NTA. This is totally reasonable. Did your husband perhaps already make arrangements for you or make plans for your family despite his schedule? It may be good to talk with him why he is being so upset about and what his suggestion is", "Clearly NTA.\nOne the one hand I sort of grasp the emotional knee jerk of thinking his family was going on a vacation without him.\n\nBut\nIt is what it is.

He probably thought he was awesome for providing the 'spark' to start the vacation, but got salty when his accommodations were (understandably) no longer needed. That's why he's so against you doing you're own thing with your sister. Misery loves company.", "NAH. I think you both had different expectations for this trip. Maybe you could see if you  family could watch the kids after an early dinner one night and driver over to have a date night with your husband after his day?", "NTA - Your logic makes more sense than his because of the logistics of shuffling the kids to and from the theme park. He should be thrilled and happy for you and the kids having a great and generous opportunity to stay with your sister instead of thinking so much about himself.", "NTA, it sounds like your husband is just pissed that he actually has to go and do his job. He is flying there for work trip, the only reason you and your kids would fly there is so you could then go to Disneyland.

Honestly, I hope you and your kids and your sister/her BF have a super fun week at the parks and your husband can suck it, because he's definitely TA.", "Very reasonable considering the first option was to stay home with the kids.", "THIS right here. He's the one who said he wouldn't be able to see you or hang out with the kids from morning to late night, given conference, business dinners etc etc that that you'd be on your own. So, that's what he's pretty much getting. Can he even articulate a specific reason why he's angry? Or is this simply because you didn't consult with him first or some kind of control thing? Either way, NTA at all.", "He's expecting them to hire a car/get a taxi for the 70 minute round trip to and from the park each day. At least that's what I assume, I don't think he's expecting them to stay at the boring hotel all day, just for mum to make the extra effort so that dad can get to have \"family breakfast\".\n\nNot that I agree with his rationale, but that's what I think it is.", "Wait on his return. Be SUPER eager to see him.

You gotta see this photo - aren't they cute? Oh, that's my SiL - we were so lucky that she and her hubs could join us... it's so great to have a close and supportive family for your kids, don't you think?\"  \n\n\nThere's a MILLION ways to sell it and look good...", "Honestly I wasn\u2019t\u2026 when the idea first came up he even posed the idea (briefly) of two different rooms (in the same hotel) because of how late he could be coming back at night since his boss likes to kind of \u201cgo wild\u201d on these trips. He takes trips with his boss often where he kind of gets the VIP treatment, gets to travel and do cool things while I\u2019m home with the kids.

I mean don't do the 30 minutes, at least enjoy the thought.", "If you were at home i stead of on the trip he wouldn't get to go to the park with you, or date night, which is the real other option.", "I do kinda see his point, despite the fact that I\u2019m a huge Disney fan. What\u2019s the point in tagging along on his work trip if you guys are not going to spend any time together?", "Yea I would just go on with the plans you made with your sister. Your kids would be miserable there in a hotel that isn\u2019t for them, and they\u2019ll have fun with your sister & you and hubby will also get a date night(which he\u2019s probably too stubborn to see at the moment) if I were you, I\u2019d tell my husband to get over it because as long as you are letting him do what he needs to get done without complaining, then keeping the kids happy is your priority.", "I'm gonna guess this is as close as he gets to having a vacation trip, and now it will have even less of his wife and children.", "Historically they do tend to get a little wild on their trips, but generally he talks to me like he enjoys it and looks forward to it. When he asked if I\u2019d be OK with him going on this trip he seemed like he was genuinely excited about the offer to go", "Why can't he stay with y'all in the Epcot hotel if family breakfast is so important?", "You have very calm and rational responses, which I think is a great attitude. It sounds like he\u2019s feeling a bit left out of what\u2019s turning into a fun family vacation. Since he will have more flexibility in traveling, perhaps he can come stay the night once and have breakfast, and Uber back. And maybe a morning FaceTime breakfast with the kiddos. Hopefully he stops pouting and starts to feel happy that you guys get to experience a few days of adventure. Maybe get him some Mickey ears too :)", "So his plan is to come back late at night after drinking to the same room toddlers are in and somehow NOT wake them up??", "He said that due to his boss paying for the room, and everyone going to the conference staying in the block of rooms together he\u2019s obligated to since it\u2019s a \u201cwork trip first\u201d.", "Apparently so\u2026 that\u2019s EXACTLY what I said, and even when he\u2019s not out having fun he\u2019s one of the loudest people I know when it comes to having to be quiet\u2026 insert face palm here\u2026", "Ok, but you\u2019re obligated to put your family first (I\u2019d argue he is too, but he\u2019s right, it was a work trip first). Tell him he\u2019s got two options\u2014 join you at the other hotel since he\u2019ll likely have a rental car as well, or stop complaining.

Or are rental cars/Ubers not in play?", "NAH. I think the two of you came at the situation from two different directions and didn't react well to the new reality. He should have reacted better, but you should have also considered his feelings as well.\n\nFrom how it sounds, the only time you'll be together is on the last night so for him it'd be the same as if you and the kids had stayed home and not accompanied him st all.\n\nAlso, what would you have done if your sister wasn't going to be there? Would you still booked a separate hotel? Did you and your husband have any sort of discussion about the hotel situation before you brought it up to your sister?

Or did you only speak about changing hotels with your sister first and let your husband in on the plan after the fact?", "NTA--He would be busy ALL DAY. So you are expected to stay at the hotel all day and do nothing with toddlers while he is out doing whatever for work.\n\nIt is a brilliant idea to stay with your sister and it is so nice she offered, especially with helping with your kids, ON VACATION.\n\nIf your husband can begrudge his kids a fun trip with family, WHILE WORKING ALL DAY. then he is selfish. It is a WORK TRIP like he told you so now he's acting all hurt you get to actually have a good time with the kids WITHOUT stressing him out while there. \n\nAs for him having fun with his boss and partying, drinking....I guess you aren't allowed AND you'd still HAVE THE KIDS. Talk about selfish.", "Ha.  NTA He can\u2019t have it both ways.  If you stayed home he wouldn\u2019t have you and the kids near.  You wanted to go and he said he would be busy day and night.  Go have fun", "NTA and WTF!  When he thought he was going by himself it doesn't sound like he was that concerned about his family being together.", "NTA. He has already said he will basically be working early until late with no time for you. Instead of worrying about whey suits him, he should start thinking what is best for all of you.", "NTA\n\nThe plane tickets are bought, go with the kids, stay with your sister, and let him get over himself.\n\nhe said you would be dealing with your kids alone, because he had conferences, and work dinners and wouldn't be there most of time. So what does he expect you to do, when you are not at Disney? Who's is going to help with the car seats, and getting you back and forth to the theme park etc? Why should you have to travel over thirty minutes one way just to sleep next to him at night whenever he decides he is done with his work dinners? He is being unreasonable. \n\nWhat would he do if he went alone without you guys, and you guys went somewhere else on vacation without him? How is this different?", "YTA. He had a work trip and asked if you wanted to come along. The alternative was you being at home. You have now turned this into a giant Disney family vacation that he is completely excluded from, and you can\u2019t understand why he\u2019s bummed? I mean I get why the trip expanded like it did, but remember that this was his thing in the first place.", "Nta. Seems fair and a good compromise", "INFO: Have you guys ever taken the kids to something as special and exciting as Disney World before? Even if your husband isn\u2019t into theme parks for himself, is it possible that he\u2019s upset at missing out on getting to see your two kids experience Disney for the first time?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make him getting super angry and refusing to talk ok, just something that might be worth asking him about.", "NTA\n\nYou're going so you can take the kids on holiday. I mean if you're going to have to take off work anyway, might as well make a trip of it.\n\nYour husband is going strictly for work. It's selfish for him to expect you to be waiting on him at his hotel the entire time. He's putting his irrational wants first.", "NTA\n\nHe maybe just upset since you're all traveling but won't be staying together.", "NTA - go stay at the other hotel ur husband Doesn\u2019t like to enjoy any of the stuff that you guys do so it\u2019s a win-win he\u2019s just upset maybe that you guys won\u2019t get to spend nights together but otherwise he\u2019s working so he can\u2019t get a say what you do", "NTA, nothing wrong with what you're planning. Let him work or suggest he stay with you and travel for work.", "NTA, it seemed like a reasonable request. Your husband insisted he wouldn\u2019t be around much anyway, so I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019d be so insistent to have you and the kids staying in the hotel he\u2019s staying at.", "NTA. This makes sense, I don\u2019t know why he\u2019d be pissed at this lol", "NTA. Let him rent a car and drive to his hotel. Then he can spend a little time with you and you will be near the fun stuff.", "NTA.\n\nHe's on a business trip.\n\nYou're on a  leisure trip.", "NTA I get why he's upset, but that doesn't make it any less valid as a solution. He doesn't have to like it for it to be the right choice.", "NTA \nIf you stayed home with the kids y'all wouldn't be in the same place so why is he bothered y'all aren't staying in the same hotel.", "Wow; what a hostile reaction!\n\nFirst thought was he never wanted you along for that trip.  He agreed but also made sure you knew you\u2019d be seeing very little of him.  You were supposed to be dismayed and just stay home.  Instead you have a work around that is terrific.  Instead of you having to sacrifice, you are going to get a vacation out of this.  Your kids are getting to see Mom as the cool parent.  Nobody is going to feel inconvenienced and that upsets him big time.  I wonder why?\n\nI would think your plans would please him enormously!  He hets to work and have dinners without worrying about you or the kids.  He also gets to stop feeling guilty for making you take time off.\n\nBy the way, who made the travel arrangements that suddenly changed his hotel to one inconvenient for your accompanying him?  \n\nConsider that this imposition on your time may have been the first of more to come.  If you use up your vacation time staying home when he is on a business trip, you essentially provide him with an out at your expense; no vacations for you.\n Basically, you screwed up whatever he was trying to manipulate you into so now he is mad; hoping you will be contrite and cancel everything to be in his good graces.", "NTA", "Is he said he'll be away from the kids that much?\n\nOriginally he was going away by himself and leaving you at home .\n\nTravelling w little kids I think you win this one. Nta", "Nta.  Everything you have done is reasonable and it's not cool if he's lashing out at you for it. I'm guessing the unexpected hotel switch on the company's part is a big part of the issue here.  I saw in one of your comments to another poster that you'd asked if he would be ok with you and the kids having fun while he was working and he replied yes.  Did he know what the hotel situation was going to be when you asked him?  In his head he may have figured that at least he would get to spend time with his wife and kids in the early mornings and evenings but with your current set up he basically doesn't get to see you or the kids til the last day.  Those are two very different work/travel experiences for him.  It's like the difference between being a long haul truck driver and the guy who gets to come home every night despite driving the same type of truck.  Just food for thought.  Maybe a visit with you and the kids or just you one or two nights would make him feel a little less left out if that is the issue for him.", "NTA sounds like he just feels left out. When he calms just try to talk to him on a way to express the pros and cons of all your options. Explain why this option is the most beneficial to everyone cause either you go and do your idea where you and the kids are happy and safe with family and he can join after, you trapped in a hotel room ALL DAY with two small children, or you staying home where even then he wouldn't have you. Maybe consider if there's a chance he can stay with you for this trip and just meet at the designated times he's booked for work? I know some companies will do that if you talk to your manament team cause at the end of the day it saves the company money to not have to pay for your room if you offer to stay elsewhere out of your own pocket while still attending required work activities at their time slots", "Kids need a pool.  That hotel has no pool.  It\u2019s Florida.  They would want a pool.  Also needs a hotel nearby for naps.  Trust me, with kids that age, they need naps after spending time at the parks.  He will be gone all day and late at night.  He would wake the kids up when he comes in.  Uber would be very expensive going back and forth.  No in and out privileges for Disney parking.", "NTA. Isn\u2019t he working anyway? Wasn\u2019t he not going to see you and the kids for a week anyway? Then who the fuck cares where you stay", "NTA, this all sounds completely reasonable. Well, not his reaction but your plan.", "NTA! What the hell is wrong with your husband?!?!", "NTA \nThe family friendly park sound better. And getting to the attractions is better too.\nTell him to stay at the place you are and he can do the travel.", "NTA it sounds reasonable", "NTA\n\nGoing by the title alone I thought no way that would be the answer. But you and he are on different trips. He seems like he might be a weird-minded person who wouldn't have minded at all if you'd called them separate trips from the beginning, I don't know, and anyway that's not on you. Just tell him you're going to have a vacation with your sister to fully separate the trips in his mind, because this is stupid. You'd have been just sitting at home and he'd have been fine with it, so I really do feel like he's getting tripped up by how the whole thing is perceived.", "NTA - he is the one who will be super busy with work anyway? So why waste $$$ on a car etc when your sister is being so generous. He is cutting off his nose to spite his face. His presence was never needed, if he wants a family vacation then ya'll can discuss planning one.", "NTA, at all. This makes way more sense. Side note, you\u2019re a true champion for originally planning to take both kids by yourself. Kudos to you.", "NTA. If I were in your situation, I would suggest the same thing. You and the kids want to enjoy the trip, and all of the childcare is already on your shoulders. I would  think that your husband would be happy to find a way to make your trip more enjoyable.", "NTA.  When I first saw the title, I wasn't sure, but when you said how un-family friendly the hotel is and how far away I can't understand why he would want to make you so miserable.", "I think your first question is exactly his biggest issue with the whole thing. I think he thinks that if my sister wasn\u2019t going, I\u2019d suck it up with the accommodations. But I had said I wanted to wait until we new what the accommodations would be before committing to the trip (for exactly this reason) and unfortunately we had to by the plane tickets before we found out the hotel info, so it just happened in a really bad order. I never really talked to my sister about changing hotels, when she asked where we would be staying I told her we were waiting to find out. Once we got the info I let her know and obviously told her the challenges I was facing because of the situation, and she offered up the idea. I never committed to it but just said I would talk to my husband and that I was grateful for the offer and that it sounded like a good idea.", "I\u2019m the one that asked if we could come along and I could bring the kids to Disney. He gets to go on cool work trips at least a couple times a year to different places and I always stay home with the kids. He knows I\u2019ve been dying to go to Disney and he\u2019s not a big theme park person so it seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to ask if we could come along. We also planned an extra day at the tail end of the trip so he could go to the park of his choice with us. I\u2019m not trying to exclude him, we just didn\u2019t know the accommodations before buying the tickets and now the accommodations are really challenging for me and the kids. That\u2019s really all it\u2019s about.", "So you didn\u2019t actually really read the post did you? OP asked if she could go and take the kids to Disney and stuff and the husband said sure but told her several times he would be working all day and late at night and she was totally on her own with the kids the whole time", "He wanted her to realize that if she went with him on his work trip it was going to be a terrible time and she was going to have to do all the childcare and shouldn\u2019t expect anything from him because he is going to act the exact same way as he would if they weren\u2019t there. This way she won\u2019t ask to come on these trips in the future. But now that it turns out it is actually going to be a good time for her he\u2019s going to have a harder time convincing her not to for example suggest to her sister that this becomes a common occurrence if this is a yearly conference.", "He was, but he says he\u2019s obligated to stay at the business hotel with his boss and colleagues", "We\u2019ve never done anything as big as Disney before but we have done other trips with them. I asked him specifically before we made any purchases if he was SURE he wouldn\u2019t be upset or feel like he was missing out if the girls and I went to Disney, but I could defiantly see him feeling differently as plans are being made. I should note we are staying one day past the conference so he can come with us to the park of his choice.", "We did talk about him moving hotels but he said it\u2019s not an option. He boss also loves the \u201cnight life\u201d on these trips and so does my husband; he even told me before we booked the flight that him and his boss party and he will still be doing that even with us there.", "He\u2019s upset she\u2019s on vacation without him. He\u2019ll be stuck in the stuffy hotel while they are having fun for a week.", "Bingo. \n\nHubby must not be very far in business yet if he doesn\u2019t see how this plays better for him.", "He and the boss may be bros. It\u2019s a shame he\u2019s not a considerate husband and father. \n\nDisney recommends you take the children to your hotel room midday for a nap. How the heck can you do that at 35 minutes away? Then go back later for the evening shows. \n\nThere is no way this can be successfully done his way. I\u2019d honestly rather stay home. I\u2019ve done Disney multiple times with kids. Trust me. You are NTA but HE certainly is.", "Ok so if it\u2019s all fine, why are you here asking?", "And now you've figured it out as requested.", "He can't have it both ways.\n\nHonestly, you were not even supposed to be with him on the trip in the first place. If you stayed at home, would he be pissed too?\n\nYou say that he gets to travel with work several times a year, and that he parties with his boss etc. on these trips. Meanwhile, you are stuck at home with all the childcare, using up your vacation days just so he can nurture his career and party with his boss. This time you found something fun to do in YOUR VACATION, something that's fun for both you and the kids, and then hubby complains?", "I see!\n\nSo if he got angry at you for simply suggesting the idea then shame on him. I do sympathize that logic doesnt always win out over feelings and he's clearly hurt over the idea of not having you and the kids with him even if its in the style of passing ships.\n\nIt really depends on how you approached him with the idea but if it genuinely was just you suggesting and expressing interest in the idea and he \"got pissed\" then you are definitely owed an apology. He let his feeling of abandonment go in a toxic direction.\n\nThe only thing I will say is his anger came from a place of feeling secure in knowing he'd have you guys close with him and then having the surprise of that being taken away suddenly. Just keep that in the back of your mind if you try to revisit the conversation with him.\n\nBut also, stand up for an apology. Anger is almost never the right response to a partner", "Then I don't see why he has such an issue then. You won't see him much anyways regardless of where you stay. There, the other place, or home. At this point I'd just say screw it and just go along with your plan anyways and treat it as your own separate trip from his. But that's just me. He's being very unreasonable.", "Seriously? Your HB wants to act like you and the kids are not there. Then why does he need you to be there?", "He is not abandoning them, he is working.  \n\nThis is a work trip.", "He said he\u2019s obligated to stay at the business hotel with his boss and colleagues", "He was going to join us at Disney on the last day there after the conference was over.", "Same! I\u2019m an only child, but I like to think that in the alternate universe where I have siblings they\u2019re as cool as op\u2019s sister!", "Oh he won\u2019t be stuck in the hotel. His boss LOVES to party and they always go out partying and to VIP stuff when he goes on these trips. He even warned me before we booked that he\u2019d likely be out late more than once", "It\u2019s not all fine?!? Like I said I\u2019m the post he\u2019s not speaking to me about the trip because he thinks I\u2019m the AH for asking about the hotel. I\u2019m trying to say he\u2019s not totally excluded and I\u2019m the one that asked to go, he didn\u2019t invite me along.", "I said this above, but I wanted to give it more visibility.\n\nI think he's mad because he thinks of this as your trip. You need to separate that in your mind -- he's going on a business trip, you're going on vacation, it just happens to be the same city. If possible it would be good to get flying down with your sister to even further cut the weird misunderstanding of things he seems to have.", "And hers is a vacation. There's nothing wrong with them both doing what they want, since she'd have just been sitting at home otherwise and he'd have NO in-person contact with her that way.", "Oh I missed that. Sorry. Maybe you could split the time? A few nights with your husband? A few nights closer to disney?", "NTA. Also you're the one who suggested tagging along in the first place. I'd understand him being pissed if he had suggested it. But he didn't. You did. You wouldn't even be in the same city otherwise", "honestly, he may just be salty that he's on a work trip while the rest of his family is having a Disney vacation and the separate hotel is just rubbing that in a little bit lol", "I think the real reason he is upset is that he straight up wanted to make this an example of why you shouldn\u2019t ever ask to tag along on his work trips - he knew that it would be relatively stressful for you to go to Disney with two kids and hoped that would discourage you but when you didn\u2019t express any concern he decided to let you see for yourself but now that your sister and brother in law are going and are making it actually something that sounds fun and enjoyable he just sounds kind of jealous and a little bit petty because he was hoping that ultimately you\u2019d \u201crealize\u201d you should just let him go on his work conferences alone and he doesn\u2019t have to be the bad guy who actually tells you he doesn\u2019t want you there.", "I\u2019ve been told Ubers when needing car seats are really unreliable. I don\u2019t know this for sure because we don\u2019t have Uber in the area we live which is really rural. I\u2019m really trying to avoid needing to rent a car and deal with flying car seats down or purchasing/renting car seats once we\u2019re there.

Just arrange for a rental car with a car seat or talk to the hotel about shuttle services. You can have breakfast with him and then leave after that and come back home at night so he at least spends some time with you. Work is already hard enough and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s choosing to spend it away from you, he\u2019s doing it to provide for you and the children so you should put him first over enjoyment if it means a little more difficulty for you. He\u2019s only asking to spend time with you, that\u2019s a relationship \u201cproblem\u201d a lot of people would beg for", "What?????\n\n\nThis was originally his (your?) work trip without the wife and kids.

His boss looooves to party on these trips and so does my husband. Generally when they travel together they are out all night drinking, eating at fancy restaurants and having fun. I\u2019m lucky to even get one call a day from him when he goes on these trips normally. Aside from a quick breakfast I think it\u2019s more likely he\u2019d wake us all up coming into the hotel room late at night after we\u2019ve all already gone to sleep. I think he\u2019s getting more and more jealous as he hears the plans I\u2019m making with my sister and he\u2019s feeling left out. I totally understand feeling left out, but I don\u2019t think things would really be any different (for him) if we stayed at his hotel.", "Why should the kids have to put up with wasting an hour of each day commuting, and also be stuck staying in a hotel that has nothing geared toward kids (like a pool)? Her husband can commute to breakfast if it's that important to him. Frankly, I don't see why he can't check into his assigned room in the hotel his boss is paying for, then actually spend his nights at the other hotel with his family \u2013 but I definitely don't see the merit in maximizing, rather than minimizing, the number of people who have to be inconvenienced.", "But if she stayed home they would be seperated too?

Having one toddler at a theme park would be difficult on a parent going solo. Two toddlers would be significantly more difficult, so he was probably banking on you only doing it once - then you'd be content to wait for him til he could schedule you and your children in. \n\nHe was fine as long as you were going to have two toddlers, on your own, all day, every day. He was probably banking on your being so overjoyed and grateful to have his help at the end of every day that you wouldn't mind him having a couple of wild nights with his colleagues, during the trip. \n\nHe's mad now because you'll have help and fun with your toddlers, all day, every day, at the fun hotel - while he'll be working all day in the boring hotel. He's not looking forward to hearing about all the fun adventures you and your children will be having without him. He's not loving the fact that this will be a true vacation for you and your children, which makes his \"work first\" trip seem pale and unappealing. Sure, he gets to live it up with his colleagues in the evenings, but you and your children will be living it up all day, every day.\n\nHe was okay with you going, while your trip centered on him and his work schedule - but heaven forbid you should have a more fun reason for going that doesn't involve ironing his shirts and waiting for him to have time for you all to have fun together as a family.\n\nCould he also be jealous that your sister's boyfriend may see some of the childhood firsts that your husband will miss? It might not matter about your sister, but sometimes when a father misses a childhood first that another man gets to see, the father gets a rush of jealousy that clouds their thinking about most everything else.\n\nEither way, he's being an AH. You weren't taking the week off as a vacation. You were taking the week off your outside-home job, in order to double your inside-home job - so that he could take a \"work-first\" party trip with his colleagues. In doing so, you've received an offer to lighten your emphasis on work and add in more fun. Don't give that up, just because he's jealous that he's not getting the same perks.", "NTA. He has a work trip and you staying in a hotel with free services to the things you and the kids are doing makes sense.

This was done under the assumption that his work was doing things the way they normally do. \n\nHis work changed things from previously. \n\nIt now no longer worked for you.\n\nYou have an alternate opportunity. It makes sense to use it.  The only other options are: stay home with the kids. Stay in his hotel and bother him all day. Which does he prefer truly? \n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole.

I asked him if he was sure he wouldn\u2019t be upset knowing the kids and I were off at Disney world but I know feelings can change once that reality really sets in. He goes on trips a lot where I have to stay home and he gets to have cool experiences, travel and have VIP treatments while I stay at home with the kids. We also planned to stay a day past the conference so he could come with us on the last day to his park of choice to finish the trip as a family.", "I mean he was more than ready to abandon you at home for a week to go to his meeting and dinners, what changed? The fact that now you aren't stuck at home with the kids?", "But he was already doing his own thing. I could understand if it was just work, but the going out at night to party, the part where he told you that you would be 100 percent alone in caring for the children, etc. He either wants you there, and then we should actively spend time with you when he's not working, and priorities you over going to night clubs. Or he chooses to do his own thing, and you are allowed to make plans with your sister.\n\nHe can't expect you to be there and have a crappy time, just so he can see you for 15 minutes at breakfast before he is gone for the rest of the day (and night). That's not fair.", "In your other scenario the family would be taking a trip to Niagara Falls instead of Orlando, a half hour drive is nothing in Florida. Plus he's working, and won't even really have to see or entertain his family, where's the stress?", "That is true and not something I had considered. She did say that he isn\u2019t a theme park person and that her sister would be helping her with all of that stuff. Plus she is now staying with her sister, as being in the hotel work booked would be more hassle than it\u2019s worth, so it\u2019s really only the plane ride and the last day. \n\nI think the stress level would be relatively low for him since it is just the travel.

Would he be willing to stay home with the kids and use up vacation days while you went on vacation with your friends?
