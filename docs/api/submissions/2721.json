But your husband is just being petulant. He was totally OK with you being on your own with the kids back home, but suddenly it's a grave sin to be on your own with the kids in a different hotel, after he made it *clear* to you he was not going to be available for family time no matter what? It's not your fault his work booked  a different hotel. Honestly, as much as I hate to defend corporate overlords, I can't even blame them for booking a cheaper hotel. Sometimes that's just life. These are the kinds of problems a lot of people *want* to have, honestly.", "NTA - You agreed to a week off work and it makes sense for it to be an actual week off for you.  It doesn\u2019t sound as if the accommodation is at all suitable for kids that age. I get where your husband is coming from however the travel would be a pain for you and the kids and it would be great for you to get a break as it is your annual leave after all.", "NTA.  What was proposed by your sister sounds reasonable.  Spell it out to your husband about the extra expense that a rental car and parking at the parks will cost.  Plus, a 2 and 4 year old in a business type hotel with no pool would be a disaster.  I hope you can talk some sense into your husband.", "NTA. Your husband is TA for getting mad that you would want the vacation to work for the rest of the family instead of just him.", "You\u2019re NTA. This one is pretty easy. \n\nHe\u2019s on a work trip and will be working late. The other hotel is better for you and the kids. \n\nDisney is already extremely expensive and can be a headache for the parent. No need to add additional stress. Tell him to swing by if he gets a break from work and to be happy his kids are being taken care of while he\u2019s working.", "NTA. Theme parks aren\u2019t fun. I\u2019m an Orlando native.

Sit around and wait for him so that you can all go to sleep", "NTA seems like would be easier for him yall not being there while he\u2019s busy with working late ect. He\u2019s not looking at how inconvenient it would be for you with the kids the whole time,", "NTA. What does your husband expect you to do? There isn\u2019t anything for the children to do at the hotel and it will cost more. Also he will be really busy working so being with your sister makes more sense.

What you chose to do is practical and does simplify the time for you and the kids. In the same token, having y'all in the room with him when he's done with his work to help him relax and recharge is a benefit to him.\n\nHe is a bit more of TA for going off on the suggestion however and not giving it serious thought.", "NTA because I have lived in Orlando and it can be a real nightmare getting around the attractions area! It really is going to save you a lot of time and hassle. Maybe your husband will understand once you\u2019re there and he sees how not-fun it would\u2019ve been at his hotel.", "He literally said he'd be unavailable most of the time anyway.  You're changing hotels for the kids enjoyment.  I see no problem really. You probably would stay with him if it was kid free, but it isn't.  You're making the best of it!  NTA by any stretch.", "NTA why is it all on his terms? He will be working.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYou should never have butted in on a weeklong work conference to begin with. Who the hell wants to be all day and evening at work functions and then come back to a hotel room to deal with a wife and 2 toddlers?  Ever heard of needing some downtime to recharge and rest?\n\nYour husband is overreacting to the change of plans though.  He should be delighted that you're going to another hotel, I agree with you.  But he's probably angry that you initially tagged on as if you wanted a family thing and now you're bailing out with your sister.", "Maybe he is upset you decided to have a family vacation with your sister instead of your original plan of being with him at bedtime and in the mornings. Maybe he is upset he will miss the excitement in his kid's faces when they see Disney world for the first time (I'm assuming it their first time) maybe is worried that while he is at work, in those conferences, all he will be thinking about is much fun his family will be having and how much he is missing out.\n\n On the other hand it wouldn't be fair to you and the kids to be trapped in a boring hotel all day. Young kids need to burn energy. Plus it would be easier for him to Uber then you to have to rent a car, carry two car seats, and drag whatever luggage through mco.", "ESH. Did you not ask about the hotel? Did he know and not tell you?", "NTA why should  you be at  home working and looking after the kids full time. Its  your week too. He cant join you, so what.

Thankfully he will get to spend the last day at the parks with his family and have some memories as well. Let the kids have fun and be kids. Let you spend some time with your sister. The days are too long or too much for him, he can go back to the room, FaceTime you guys, and then relax himself.

Now he/you have to put money out on a hotel.\n\nAlso why is it a necessity that he stay in the business hotel with his boss?", "YTA - this is a work trip for him.  You are effectively spending money on a really nice vacation for you and the kids that he doesn\u2019t get to enjoy.  He liked the idea at first, because he would have you and the kids at his room or with him when his work day was over.  Now you aren\u2019t even staying in the hotel, so he won\u2019t see you at all until the last day.  So yes, he is frustrated and upset that you are going on a vacation with the kids without him.\n\nMy husband and I spend years in careers where we both had work conferences.  We drew a line early on that no matter where the conference was, it was work, not a vacation for the spouse.  If we wanted a vacation at that site, we would plan it for a separate time where we were together as a family (we had a child), and not part of a work conference because it is distracting.  Both my husband and I would talk about colleagues who would,bring their families to work conferences and it was a huge distraction for those people.  They would do it to save money because the company was paying for the hotel room and the employee\u2019s airline ticket.  One of my work conferences had a policy of no spouses or family allowed, because it was a distraction to the employee.  A lot of productive conversations, meetings, and networking happen outside of the scheduled sessions.\n\nMy husband wasn\u2019t crazy on theme parks, so there times where our son and I would go to the park while hubby hung out at the pool, and the. We would meet back up for lunch or dinner.

I think he\u2019s sad that he wouldn\u2019t see us at all those first few days even if he\u2019d only be seeing us for a few minutes in the morning or evening, and he feels like it\u2019s more a trip for me and my sister now even though this would actually allow us the date night we were hoping for and everything.", "I would agree IF the husband had seemed like he wanted the wife and kids there..

We\u2019ve done business trips with one kid, one kid and pregnant, one kid and one infant with formula I had to make from scratch (that was fun lol), and one kid and a toddler. He always asks me if we want to tag along. (Aka go on vacation without him.) Because of that my kiddos have experienced AMAZING things. (We also homeschool so that makes things a lot easier when it comes to traveling.) My oldest has gone through the living human exhibit, gone to different space centers, collected sand and done experiments on it, gone to natural history and natural science museums, gone to about 5 different zoos (red pandas are the favorite), and so much more.", "Before we ever booked the tickets I asked him specifically if it was going to be too hard on him knowing that the kids and I were at Disney for the first time having fun while he was working.

Is one or the other, he can't have both.", "There would be an added cost but my sister said they would split the cost of a room with us so I still think it would be cheaper than renting a car, car seats, paying for parking at the hotel and parks, gas, etc. he said he has to stay there out of courtesy of his boss for paying for the room, and because him and his boss are sort of like \u201cbros\u201d when they go on work trips together, they go out a lot at night and everyone else from work/ people going to the conference are all staying there in blocked rooms", "Isn't he already essentially abandoning you for long days and into the night while he is working?\n\nBreakfast with him is a relatively small sacrifice for the help and support of family and much better accommodation for the circumstances you are in.", "Maybe just that she said yes to it without consulting him, even though this is the only choice that makes all of their time there more enjoyable. \n\nP.S.

Could still have the date night with the kids at the cousins for one night.", "How long is the trip? Would it be feasible to spend a day or two in the hotel with your husband, and then go to your sister a couple days before he\u2019s able to come join you all? Maybe the kids can do activities in or near the hotel for a day or so without you having to transport them a half hour away to Disney, and they can spend mornings with dad \u2014 and then the second leg of the trip is the Disney trip with their cousins.", "Couldn't your husband simply move hotels with you?  That way, your daily chores are simplified,  he could uber to his conference and see you daily", "As a workaholic, his reaction tells he wants them there when he\u2019s done for the day to help him keep his mind right.", "He immediately agreed to them coming and they booked the wife and kids plane tickets to join him the same day.

That's not great for a marriage either.", "He\u2019s definitely not in introvert or an over thinker, I think when he agreed to us coming he thought it was just going to be a very simple arrangement and didn\u2019t really expect the amount of planning it takes to travel with toddlers and now he\u2019s feeling left out.", "Seems so odd that he is getting so upset by this, maybe its just the initial reaction to the idea. I hope he calms down and understands why it's best for you and the kids.", "I mean, I think the issue is that he was expecting to have his family there, and now he gets to miss out on that because he has to work. \n\nSince you say he's not a big theme park fan, maybe the solution is that he gets to choose what the next vacation is", "He didn\u2019t ask them to come as it was suppose to be a week long business trip with lots of meetings and meals.

He and OP didn't know he was going to be at a business hotel nowhere near Disney when any of the plans were made. But that doesn't make it any less unsuitable for the plan to go to Disney...

But that's not the case.", "Just because you read the post doesn't mean you understood the post or the events that transpired. It seems you lack the experience to fully comprehend what happened and are just blaming the husband for this situation because OBVIOUSLY he is wrong for, once it was suggested to make it a family trip, actually wanting his family there. You're right. They shouldn't be going and he should suffer in misery for having the audacity for being offended that a trip he was looking forward to with his family was cut to only a single night with his partner at the end of it.\n\nI do hope one day someone opens your eyes to the reality of the world around you and it is not clear cut to what you think it is.\n\nAs a point of reference, my original answer is one from EXPERIENCE in being in this situation before.

And if your husband stays this way when he meets up for the last day.... Have him watch the kids and go for a night out with sister and BFIL. That sounds like a lot more fun.", "NTA\u2026he sounds jealous", "NTA Your plan sounds perfectly logical, his...not so much seeing as he is working all the time anyway and his hotel has no facilities and is further away.", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s being weirdly controlling. He\u2019s not going to even see you because he\u2019s going to be working. He should have been happy and grateful.", "NTA My take? Hubby has told everyone how his perfect family will be there, and how he's such a super dad he's paid for them to go Disney while he works, but he'll be super dad every morning at breakfast. My god, he's  a walking hero!\n\nWhere are your kids dude?\nErm....\n\nThis is about him playing a PR point on you going with him and now it won't happen. THAT'S  why he's angry. You just made him look a fool and hurt his career as far as he's concerned. IMHO.", "NTA.", "NTA but you're spending your vacation time and probably your vacation budget to go on a vacation without him. I can see where he's hurt. I also think spending your vacation time in a hotel that's not child friendly isn't fair, either. The problem is that his employer did something different than you assumed they would. It's no one's fault and now you have to find alternate solutions to how to bridge this being both your family vacation and a work trip. You should work together to find ways to include him.", "NTA\n\nThe husband makes no sense...\n\nHe asks for permission thinking he'll be alone on the business trip.\n \nThen he agrees with his family coming, but insists that it is a work trip and that OP will be mostly on their own.\n\nThen he makes a fuss about not having family time!?", "NTA. \nDidn\u2019t he already say you were on your own with the kids?", "Nta\n\nI'm guessing he has never has kids in a hotel without you doing all the work.", "NTA \n\nyour husband sounds a little but hurt that he will miss out on the fun, but he was going to miss out anyway", "NTA. This is totally reasonable. Did your husband perhaps already make arrangements for you or make plans for your family despite his schedule? It may be good to talk with him why he is being so upset about and what his suggestion is", "Clearly NTA.\nOne the one hand I sort of grasp the emotional knee jerk of thinking his family was going on a vacation without him.\n\nBut\nIt is what it is. No need to punish everyone. This all sounds like a perfect solution and really the only way to get a kid free date night.\n\nHe\u2019s not thinking it through.", "Maybe he's pissed because he wasnt invited to the fun hotel with you guys.", "NTA", "NTA at all. Sounds very reasonable. Besides, being cooped up in a business hotel with two kids and no help might be pretty miserable for all involved.", "NTA, your hubby is jealous that you're both going on the trip to the same place at the same time, but you will clearly be having a better time than him. He probably thought he was awesome for providing the 'spark' to start the vacation, but got salty when his accommodations were (understandably) no longer needed. That's why he's so against you doing you're own thing with your sister. Misery loves company.", "NAH. I think you both had different expectations for this trip. Maybe you could see if you  family could watch the kids after an early dinner one night and driver over to have a date night with your husband after his day?", "NTA - Your logic makes more sense than his because of the logistics of shuffling the kids to and from the theme park. He should be thrilled and happy for you and the kids having a great and generous opportunity to stay with your sister instead of thinking so much about himself.", "NTA, it sounds like your husband is just pissed that he actually has to go and do his job. He is flying there for work trip, the only reason you and your kids would fly there is so you could then go to Disneyland. He's not a child you can't abandon him, you are leaving him to go and do his work and giving your kids a fun time. Hopefully when he calms down he'll apologize to you", "You have three kids, hun. Hubby needs to grow up. Honestly, I hope you and your kids and your sister/her BF have a super fun week at the parks and your husband can suck it, because he's definitely TA.", "Very reasonable considering the first option was to stay home with the kids.", "THIS right here. He's the one who said he wouldn't be able to see you or hang out with the kids from morning to late night, given conference, business dinners etc etc that that you'd be on your own. So, that's what he's pretty much getting. Can he even articulate a specific reason why he's angry? Or is this simply because you didn't consult with him first or some kind of control thing? Either way, NTA at all.", "He's expecting them to hire a car/get a taxi for the 70 minute round trip to and from the park each day. At least that's what I assume, I don't think he's expecting them to stay at the boring hotel all day, just for mum to make the extra effort so that dad can get to have \"family breakfast\".\n\nNot that I agree with his rationale, but that's what I think it is.", "Wait on his return. Be SUPER eager to see him. Hang off him at breakfast - which will ABSOLUTELY be where his management team/clients he's trying to woo/business contacts he's trying to impress are - so that everyone can see how much of a devoted family man he is.   \n\n\nThey're window dressing.  \n\n\nNow, if he was smart, he'd send them to Disney, and have her text him updates and photos - like, at lunch and coffee break times. THAT way, he can say 'Excuse me just a sec', check his phone, smile like a dope, and come back to the conversation with a \"Sorry, my wife just sent me the MOST gorgeous shot of our kids... they're doing Disney this week while I'm working, and then we're taking a few days as a family to go to...\\[insert family-friendly beach here\\]. You gotta see this photo - aren't they cute? Oh, that's my SiL - we were so lucky that she and her hubs could join us... it's so great to have a close and supportive family for your kids, don't you think?\"  \n\n\nThere's a MILLION ways to sell it and look good...", "Honestly I wasn\u2019t\u2026 when the idea first came up he even posed the idea (briefly) of two different rooms (in the same hotel) because of how late he could be coming back at night since his boss likes to kind of \u201cgo wild\u201d on these trips. He takes trips with his boss often where he kind of gets the VIP treatment, gets to travel and do cool things while I\u2019m home with the kids. When I asked about coming he stressed so heavily that this was a \u201cwork trip first\u201d, I really didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal at all.", "I wish I could up \u2b06\ufe0f vote you 100x.  This is so on point.", "Yep! Numerous times. That it was a \u201cwork trip first\u201d and id have to figure everything out with the kids on my own.", "It might be good to talk to him about why he is so upset and what his advice is", "I honestly thought that was the plan from the get go.\n\nYou don't want your room next to your coworkers when you have a spouse and kids with you", "Can he not stay at the hotel closer to disney? Let him drive the 35 min instead of you?", "I think it's nice that although he knows he will be busy, he is trying to spend time with you and the kids. Even if it is just breakfast. I mean don't do the 30 minutes, at least enjoy the thought.", "If you were at home i stead of on the trip he wouldn't get to go to the park with you, or date night, which is the real other option.", "I do kinda see his point, despite the fact that I\u2019m a huge Disney fan. What\u2019s the point in tagging along on his work trip if you guys are not going to spend any time together?", "Yea I would just go on with the plans you made with your sister. Your kids would be miserable there in a hotel that isn\u2019t for them, and they\u2019ll have fun with your sister & you and hubby will also get a date night(which he\u2019s probably too stubborn to see at the moment) if I were you, I\u2019d tell my husband to get over it because as long as you are letting him do what he needs to get done without complaining, then keeping the kids happy is your priority.", "I'm gonna guess this is as close as he gets to having a vacation trip, and now it will have even less of his wife and children.", "Historically they do tend to get a little wild on their trips, but generally he talks to me like he enjoys it and looks forward to it. When he asked if I\u2019d be OK with him going on this trip he seemed like he was genuinely excited about the offer to go", "Why can't he stay with y'all in the Epcot hotel if family breakfast is so important?", "You have very calm and rational responses, which I think is a great attitude. It sounds like he\u2019s feeling a bit left out of what\u2019s turning into a fun family vacation. Since he will have more flexibility in traveling, perhaps he can come stay the night once and have breakfast, and Uber back. And maybe a morning FaceTime breakfast with the kiddos. Hopefully he stops pouting and starts to feel happy that you guys get to experience a few days of adventure. Maybe get him some Mickey ears too :)", "So his plan is to come back late at night after drinking to the same room toddlers are in and somehow NOT wake them up??", "He said that due to his boss paying for the room, and everyone going to the conference staying in the block of rooms together he\u2019s obligated to since it\u2019s a \u201cwork trip first\u201d.", "Apparently so\u2026 that\u2019s EXACTLY what I said, and even when he\u2019s not out having fun he\u2019s one of the loudest people I know when it comes to having to be quiet\u2026 insert face palm here\u2026", "Ok, but you\u2019re obligated to put your family first (I\u2019d argue he is too, but he\u2019s right, it was a work trip first). Tell him he\u2019s got two options\u2014 join you at the other hotel since he\u2019ll likely have a rental car as well, or stop complaining. You need to be able to stand up to your husband and tell him he\u2019s being unreasonable and you won\u2019t tolerate it, or else these behaviors spiral.", "Can't y'all meet somewhere between the hotels at a breakfast joint? Or are rental cars/Ubers not in play?"]}
