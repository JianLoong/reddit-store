But your husband is just being petulant. He was totally OK with you being on your own with the kids back home, but suddenly it's a grave sin to be on your own with the kids in a different hotel, after he made it *clear* to you he was not going to be available for family time no matter what? It's not your fault his work booked  a different hotel. Honestly, as much as I hate to defend corporate overlords, I can't even blame them for booking a cheaper hotel. Sometimes that's just life. These are the kinds of problems a lot of people *want* to have, honestly.", "NTA - You agreed to a week off work and it makes sense for it to be an actual week off for you.  It doesn\u2019t sound as if the accommodation is at all suitable for kids that age. I get where your husband is coming from however the travel would be a pain for you and the kids and it would be great for you to get a break as it is your annual leave after all.", "NTA.  What was proposed by your sister sounds reasonable.  Spell it out to your husband about the extra expense that a rental car and parking at the parks will cost.  Plus, a 2 and 4 year old in a business type hotel with no pool would be a disaster.  I hope you can talk some sense into your husband.", "NTA. Your husband is TA for getting mad that you would want the vacation to work for the rest of the family instead of just him.", "You\u2019re NTA. This one is pretty easy. \n\nHe\u2019s on a work trip and will be working late. The other hotel is better for you and the kids. \n\nDisney is already extremely expensive and can be a headache for the parent. No need to add additional stress. Tell him to swing by if he gets a break from work and to be happy his kids are being taken care of while he\u2019s working.", "NTA. Theme parks aren\u2019t fun. I\u2019m an Orlando native. You should definitely stay somewhere else with the kids while he has to work. He\u2019s being unreasonable here.", "NTA. He wants you to stick around and be bored in the hotel while he's not there anyway? What does it change for him?", "NTA.  You are on kid duty 24/day for the entire trip if you stay with him, and have to spend money for that \u201chonor\u201d on boring stuff.  He is being absurd.", "NTA. That sounds like a good compromise.", "NTA. He already told you he wasn\u2019t going to be around at all so what\u2019s the issue. Wha doesn\u2019t he expect you to do all day with the kids. Sit around and wait for him so that you can all go to sleep", "NTA seems like would be easier for him yall not being there while he\u2019s busy with working late ect. He\u2019s not looking at how inconvenient it would be for you with the kids the whole time,", "NTA. What does your husband expect you to do? There isn\u2019t anything for the children to do at the hotel and it will cost more. Also he will be really busy working so being with your sister makes more sense. Also in the beginning he didn\u2019t ask if you wanted to go but if he could go meaning without you. So he should be happy with this arrangement.", "Soft ESH here.\n\n1) Yes it would be easier on you and the kids to have your fun since he will be working pretty much the entire time.\n\n2) However for him, coming back to the hotel with you and the kids there would probably do quite a lot for his mental health by having y'all there so he could interact and see everyones smiles for what he missed.\n\nThis is a case of neither side being in the wrong while both sides are also TA for not communicating effectively and coming up with a plan together that would be beneficial for all.\n\nI can honestly see both sides being a workaholic myself. What you chose to do is practical and does simplify the time for you and the kids. In the same token, having y'all in the room with him when he's done with his work to help him relax and recharge is a benefit to him.\n\nHe is a bit more of TA for going off on the suggestion however and not giving it serious thought.", "NTA because I have lived in Orlando and it can be a real nightmare getting around the attractions area! It really is going to save you a lot of time and hassle. Maybe your husband will understand once you\u2019re there and he sees how not-fun it would\u2019ve been at his hotel.", "He literally said he'd be unavailable most of the time anyway.  You're changing hotels for the kids enjoyment.  I see no problem really. You probably would stay with him if it was kid free, but it isn't.  You're making the best of it!  NTA by any stretch.", "NTA why is it all on his terms? He will be working.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYou should never have butted in on a weeklong work conference to begin with. Who the hell wants to be all day and evening at work functions and then come back to a hotel room to deal with a wife and 2 toddlers?  Ever heard of needing some downtime to recharge and rest?\n\nYour husband is overreacting to the change of plans though.  He should be delighted that you're going to another hotel, I agree with you.  But he's probably angry that you initially tagged on as if you wanted a family thing and now you're bailing out with your sister.", "Maybe he is upset you decided to have a family vacation with your sister instead of your original plan of being with him at bedtime and in the mornings. Maybe he is upset he will miss the excitement in his kid's faces when they see Disney world for the first time (I'm assuming it their first time) maybe is worried that while he is at work, in those conferences, all he will be thinking about is much fun his family will be having and how much he is missing out.\n\n On the other hand it wouldn't be fair to you and the kids to be trapped in a boring hotel all day. Young kids need to burn energy. Plus it would be easier for him to Uber then you to have to rent a car, carry two car seats, and drag whatever luggage through mco.", "ESH. Did you not ask about the hotel? Did he know and not tell you?", "NTA why should  you be at  home working and looking after the kids full time. Its  your week too. He cant join you, so what. You could go anywhere  you want in the world in that week.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing with him on a business trip and then staying somewhere else is an AH move.

You and the kids should absolutely be able to have a great time while he\u2019s busy with work. Why would he expect you guys to be in a hotel with no pool or activities?

Do they want to adopt some more family? \n\nYour husband is looking at this completely in the wrong. He HAS to work and spend his time doing business things. Thankfully he will get to spend the last day at the parks with his family and have some memories as well. Let the kids have fun and be kids. Let you spend some time with your sister. The days are too long or too much for him, he can go back to the room, FaceTime you guys, and then relax himself.

If you stayed in the business hotel he probably didn\u2019t have to pay for the room.  Now he/you have to put money out on a hotel.\n\nAlso why is it a necessity that he stay in the business hotel with his boss?", "YTA - this is a work trip for him.  You are effectively spending money on a really nice vacation for you and the kids that he doesn\u2019t get to enjoy.  He liked the idea at first, because he would have you and the kids at his room or with him when his work day was over.  Now you aren\u2019t even staying in the hotel, so he won\u2019t see you at all until the last day.  So yes, he is frustrated and upset that you are going on a vacation with the kids without him.\n\nMy husband and I spend years in careers where we both had work conferences.  We drew a line early on that no matter where the conference was, it was work, not a vacation for the spouse.  If we wanted a vacation at that site, we would plan it for a separate time where we were together as a family (we had a child), and not part of a work conference because it is distracting.  Both my husband and I would talk about colleagues who would,bring their families to work conferences and it was a huge distraction for those people.  They would do it to save money because the company was paying for the hotel room and the employee\u2019s airline ticket.  One of my work conferences had a policy of no spouses or family allowed, because it was a distraction to the employee.  A lot of productive conversations, meetings, and networking happen outside of the scheduled sessions.\n\nMy husband wasn\u2019t crazy on theme parks, so there times where our son and I would go to the park while hubby hung out at the pool, and the. We would meet back up for lunch or dinner.  But we were on family time, not work time.\n\nYou are not saving any money on a vacation by staying somewhere else\u2026 you are just getting to enjoy a fun vacation with the kids while your husband has to work\u2026", "YTA - You\u2019re planning a vacation without your husband, and including other folks.\n\nThere's a big difference between \u201cthe kids and I will meet up after work\u201d and \u201cwe are in a hotel across town living our best lives.\u201d\n\nIncluding your sister was a seriously low blow.

I think he\u2019s sad that he wouldn\u2019t see us at all those first few days even if he\u2019d only be seeing us for a few minutes in the morning or evening, and he feels like it\u2019s more a trip for me and my sister now even though this would actually allow us the date night we were hoping for and everything.", "I would agree IF the husband had seemed like he wanted the wife and kids there.. But no part of this story sounds like he was pushing to have the kids with him during this time.", "Hopefully he doesn\u2019t think of his wife as an annoyance he has to \u201cdeal\u201d with after work, since he did, you know, make the decision to marry her\u2026 what kind of a comment is \u201cESH for burdening him with your presence, why would he want to deal with you?\u201d ??\n\nEspecially since the only conflict here is that she wants to go somewhere else and he actually wants them around.", "My husband does. As long as it\u2019s some place I\u2019m comfortable taking the kids to my husband always encourages us to go. We may only see him at bedtime but to him he\u2019s getting to see his wife and kids. We\u2019ve done business trips with one kid, one kid and pregnant, one kid and one infant with formula I had to make from scratch (that was fun lol), and one kid and a toddler. He always asks me if we want to tag along. (Aka go on vacation without him.) Because of that my kiddos have experienced AMAZING things. (We also homeschool so that makes things a lot easier when it comes to traveling.) My oldest has gone through the living human exhibit, gone to different space centers, collected sand and done experiments on it, gone to natural history and natural science museums, gone to about 5 different zoos (red pandas are the favorite), and so much more.", "Before we ever booked the tickets I asked him specifically if it was going to be too hard on him knowing that the kids and I were at Disney for the first time having fun while he was working. He said no and that he\u2019d be excited to join us on the last day of the trip but I think you could be right that maybe he wasn\u2019t honest in his response or his feelings have changed since my sister is involved now", "We did not know what the hotel accommodations would be like before the plane tickets were needing to be booked. We were going off of where the conference had been held in the past.", "How does OP suck", "He can't say that he won't pay attention to her and the kids or do any activity with them, but then salty when they are staying somewhere else. Is one or the other, he can't have both.", "There would be an added cost but my sister said they would split the cost of a room with us so I still think it would be cheaper than renting a car, car seats, paying for parking at the hotel and parks, gas, etc. he said he has to stay there out of courtesy of his boss for paying for the room, and because him and his boss are sort of like \u201cbros\u201d when they go on work trips together, they go out a lot at night and everyone else from work/ people going to the conference are all staying there in blocked rooms", "Isn't he already essentially abandoning you for long days and into the night while he is working?\n\nBreakfast with him is a relatively small sacrifice for the help and support of family and much better accommodation for the circumstances you are in.", "Maybe just that she said yes to it without consulting him, even though this is the only choice that makes all of their time there more enjoyable. \n\nP.S. OP, I'm happy that you have such a thoughtful and generous woman as a sister. This redditor stranger applauds her\ud83d\udc4f", "This is exactly it. Could still have the date night with the kids at the cousins for one night.", "How long is the trip? Would it be feasible to spend a day or two in the hotel with your husband, and then go to your sister a couple days before he\u2019s able to come join you all? Maybe the kids can do activities in or near the hotel for a day or so without you having to transport them a half hour away to Disney, and they can spend mornings with dad \u2014 and then the second leg of the trip is the Disney trip with their cousins.", "Couldn't your husband simply move hotels with you?  That way, your daily chores are simplified,  he could uber to his conference and see you daily", "As a workaholic, his reaction tells he wants them there when he\u2019s done for the day to help him keep his mind right.", "He immediately agreed to them coming and they booked the wife and kids plane tickets to join him the same day. He was happy they were coming. Of course OP isn\u2019t highlighting that, but it\u2019s all there in the post. OP didn\u2019t have to convince him or anything. \n\nOP tread on her husbands feelings - here he was thinking his wife wanted to come with him and at least be with him at night and in the mornings only to find out, nope. Doesn\u2019t care one bit. But OP has good reason for the change - it is much more convenient for a Disney trip, even if her husband is now totally out of the picture. \n\nThis is not good for their marriage, I can tell you that much. \n\nOP, YTA for being so indifferent to your husbands feelings, but it\u2019s not insurmountable.", "Is he an introvert that overthinks? Maybe he had a change of heart and doesn't want to rain on your or the kid's parade.", "By having you stay at that hotel was he hoping to not have to go out at night with the boss. Does boss drag him to nightclubs or strip clubs?", "I agree, that\u2019s exactly what I said to him. I\u2019m hoping we can let the issue rest and revisit it with a more clear head\u2026", "I dont think she said yes to it yet... in post in mentioned suggested and that she brought the idea up to him... he just seemed very closed off to the idea. Maybe he already feels distant from his kiddos and wife and this is making it feel worse?", "He says it\u2019s a necessity he stays in the business hotel with his boss", "But he didn't ask for them to come, he told his wife that she needed to look after them at home. There is nothing in the post or the comments that suggests this.", "I never meant to suggest he didn't want them to come. But it wasn't his idea for them to come, it was a bonus plan based on him staying in a hotel next to Disney. He then wasn't staying at a hotel next to Disney. And the new plan allows his kids the trip to Disney, facilitates help while she's there, and still allows them a date night and a day at Disney as a family. He's not out of the picture.\n\nThe husband got really mad, called her an AH and is ignoring her. That's not great for a marriage either.", "He\u2019s definitely not in introvert or an over thinker, I think when he agreed to us coming he thought it was just going to be a very simple arrangement and didn\u2019t really expect the amount of planning it takes to travel with toddlers and now he\u2019s feeling left out.", "Seems so odd that he is getting so upset by this, maybe its just the initial reaction to the idea. I hope he calms down and understands why it's best for you and the kids.", "I mean, I think the issue is that he was expecting to have his family there, and now he gets to miss out on that because he has to work. \n\nSince you say he's not a big theme park fan, maybe the solution is that he gets to choose what the next vacation is", "He didn\u2019t ask them to come as it was suppose to be a week long business trip with lots of meetings and meals. OP suggested they come along and have a day or two of family fun with implications of a few family meals as well. OP then offered a suggestion from the cousin to make it a more fun trip for them inadvertently and unintentionally leaving out the husband.\n\nAll the information is there if you can read between the lines.", "That\u2019s ridiculous.", "The husband will still have the date night and a day at Disney. The only difference is that his children won't be asleep in his room at night, and he won't be able to have breakfast with them. But, as I keep saying, he didn't request that, so he doesn't have much right to be pissed about it not happening.\n\nAnd she didn't change the plans for shits and giggles, her husband's company booked into a hotel that wasn't suitable for the kids.", "*sigh* The world isn't black and white as you seem to think it is.\n\n1) OP's Husband has business trip that would leave little time for anything else and didn't want op/kids to be doing nothing.\n\n2) OP suggests making it a family trip where they will be there with husband nights while they spend their day at Disney.\n\n3) Sister calls next day and they make plans for them all to do Disney and Universal and booked hotel near Disney.\n\n4) OP/Husband found out hotel arrangements 2 days later AFTER plans were made.\n\n5) Sister suggested booking separate hotels for Sister and OP can still have fun leaving Husband at work hotel alone. *he was looking forward to having his family there when done with work engagements even if he couldn't spend much time with them*\n\nThis boils down to a communication issue between OP and Husband.", "1) The last part is just a guess on your part. OP said she threw out the idea of going as a joke. There was no indication that he even considered them going. Maybe he did, but you're pulling it out of the air, not the post/comments.\n\n2) yes, I read the post \n\n3) same answer as 2\n\n4) again, I read the post. He and OP didn't know he was going to be at a business hotel nowhere near Disney when any of the plans were made. But that doesn't make it any less unsuitable for the plan to go to Disney... Which was always the plan for OP and the kids, whether the sister was involved or not. \n\n5) sister suggested a plan to stay at a more convenient hotel. She then suggested the plan to her husband and he didn't like it. \n\nListing the events of the post doesn't change anything. I read it. I got the order of events. \n\nI still don't think he really has any right to be angry at OP for the suggestion that she has an enjoyable/feasible trip to Disney with the kids, and he still gets a bonus date night and day at Disney with the family, as  they had planned. \n\nHad he suggested them coming on the trip, I would think it was more unfair on him, as he'd clearly wanted them there since the beginning. But that's not the case.", "Just because you read the post doesn't mean you understood the post or the events that transpired. It seems you lack the experience to fully comprehend what happened and are just blaming the husband for this situation because OBVIOUSLY he is wrong for, once it was suggested to make it a family trip, actually wanting his family there. You're right. They shouldn't be going and he should suffer in misery for having the audacity for being offended that a trip he was looking forward to with his family was cut to only a single night with his partner at the end of it.\n\nI do hope one day someone opens your eyes to the reality of the world around you and it is not clear cut to what you think it is.\n\nAs a point of reference, my original answer is one from EXPERIENCE in being in this situation before. I have a good idea what is going through his head."]}
