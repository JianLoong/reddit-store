My younger brother (Josh, M34) was also invited. Since Josh and I live in the same city (about a 45-minute drive from our parents' house), he offered to drive me and my family.\r\n\nJosh has been really excited to show us his new car (a Kia K5) and thought that this would be an excellent opportunity. The day before we were supposed to go, both Emily and Ian got a little bit of food poisoning, so they were feeling a bit ill. Emily hinted that she might want to stay home with Ian, but I convinced her to come along as I thought my parents would be upset if they didn't come.\r\n\nThe morning of the trip (yesterday), Josh arrived on schedule and we were off. Josh is a slow driver and stopped a few times at Emily\u2019s request, so Ian could get some fresh air and use the restroom. This turned our 45-minute drive into a 70-minute one. I was getting a little frustrated with Emily, as I had reminded her to make sure Ian used the restroom before we left (she forgot), and I had work related tasks on my laptop to attend to once we arrived at my parents' house.\r\n\nAs we pulled up to my parents' house, Ian began to feel even more nauseous. While Emily and I were unloading the trunk, he vomited inside the car. Josh took him out of his child seat and, as he carried him towards my parents\u2019 house, Ian vomited on Josh again.\r\n\nEmily went inside with them to take care of Ian, and I brought the rest of our belongings into the house. My mom was concerned about Ian and asked me about him. When I mentioned how both he and Emily were not feeling well, she became upset with me and told me that they should have stayed home and recovered.\r\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, I was on the porch working on my laptop. Josh came out of the house with cleaning supplies and said he was going to clean his car. He seemed a bit annoyed. So, I told him that kids can be messy sometimes and that they couldn't be held accountable for situations like this.\r\n\nHe said that he of course didn't blame Ian, but that he would appreciate some help cleaning up. I responded that Emily couldn't be expected to clean as she was ill. He said he didn't plan on asking her as she was ill, and that I should be the one helping him. I explained that I was busy with work and couldn't assist.\r\n\nHe appeared frustrated and started walking away. To ease the tension, I made a joke, suggesting that he was acting like his car was some fancy European model and not just a Kia. He didn't say anything, just shook his head and put on his airpods.\n\nLater, I shared told Emily about this interaction and how Josh was acting strange. She said that she thought I was being overly harsh. My intention wasn't to be rude, but I felt that Josh was being too pushy.\r\n\nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1692104860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rs8ng/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_it_isnt_my_wifes/", "score": 281, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.", "YTA.

Then get him a gift certificate to have his car professionally cleaned after you put your sick child in it needlessly. Edited to add: apologize to your parents for bringing sick people over. Apologize to your wife for forcing her to leave her house sick. And apologize to your son for the same reason.", "YTA YTA YTA\n\nUnbelievably selfish. Your wife and kid are sick and you convince them they need to drive an hour to your parents. Your brother shows up and dutifully stops frequently to help them out.

This just seemed to point to adding a whole extra layer to the assholery.", "YTA. You and your wife should have stayed home if you knew you were sick. Your brother was nice enough to offer you a ride and show you his new car, which he is obviously proud of. The least you could do is help him clean up the mess that your son made, or at least apologize and offer to pay for a professional cleaning service. Instead, you brushed him off, made fun of his car, and acted like it was no big deal. That's very disrespectful and ungrateful of you. You owe your brother an apology and a car wash.", "Wow !! you made fun of your brothers new car after your son destroyed the inside of it ?? You didn\u2019t even bother to help him clean it up ??", "YTA, for not cleaning the car, for automatically putting care work and cleaning on your wife's plate, and for making your wife and son come to this dinner when she told you it was a bad idea.", "YTA- Your child threw up in someone else's car and neither you the wife or the child took responsibility to clean it up.

You exposed your brother & parents to your family while they're sick. You didn't clean up after YOUR kid who was sick in your brothers new car. He's not acting strange, he's acting mad at you which he is fully entitled to. You also made your sick wife take care of your sick son, instead of you taking care of them both.\n\nYou basically made all the wrong decisions and don't seem to care about anyone but yourself. You don't even seem to take parenting seriously, every instance you mention of your sons needs fall on your wife. Why didn't you take him to the bathroom? Why didn't you notice when your son needed breaks from the drive? Why didn't you carry your son in, clean him up & get him settled? No you let your sick wife do all that while you did.....what exactly? Move bags and work when there were other more important things to take care. If you had work to do why did you travel anyway? Expecting your wife to take care of everything and handle the families needs?\n\nYou sound like a crappy husband & father.", "YTA - She tried to stay home. You insisted.

YTA", "YTA,  1000 times over.\n\nYou insisted they come with you knowing they were not well. \n\n1. As soon as YOUR son puked it became your responcibilty to clean the car. \n\n2. It was YOUR reaponsibily to take your kid in and claena him up not your wifes.\n\n3. As soo as you were done cleaning the kid up it was YOUR respnsibilty to go find cleaning stuff and go clean the car. NOT LATER or tell your brother to do it.  Or even suggest anything about your wife. \n\nYou are a HORRIBLE father and husband. No mater what the division of labor is normally when one of thise people is sick the other one takes ALL the responsibilities.", "YTA\n\nThe kids aren't responsible. You as a parent are responsible for your kids. It's definitely not your wife \"job\" either, and since she's ill that responsibility moves to you.\nThe joke was mean, too.

When your kid makes a mess you clean it up. You knew he and your wife weren\u2019t feeling well and you still insisted they go with you. And you were planning on working.

OF COURSE, YOU and your wife are responsible for cleaning it up.

I explained that I was busy with work and couldn't assist.\n\nYTA. You forced your sick wife and son to travel in a new car that is  not yours and when your son predictably barfed everywhere you didn't clean it up, but excpect your brother who was already doing you a favor, to do so (also apparently thought he wanted your sick wife to clean it and not you?

And a leaking streaming one at that. It was CLEARLY your actions, one after the other, that led to the vomit in the car. Pay to have the interior of your brother\u2019s new car cleaned, apologize to him, apologize to your wife for forcing her to go on a long drive with a child when they were both clearly ill, apologize to your mother for ruining her dinner, apologize to your 4 year old for putting him in a rough situation when he was already sick. Are you always this insensitive and selfish and generally awful?", "You are a Major league AH\n\n1) parents are responsible for the damage their kid causes. Always. \n\n2) you denegrated his vehicle which he was excited about. He takes pride in something and you disrespected it. \n\n3) that Josh even had to be pushy about you taking care of your kids mess is appalling. \n\nKids mimic their parents behavior. Do your kid a favor and get some emotional awareness.", "YTA and an uncaring prick.  If your kid makes a mess you clean it up.  If your wife and child are unwell you let them rest at home. You're a disgrace.", "YTA at every point in this sorry tale.\n\nYou coerced Emily and your son to come when they were sick.\n\nYou could also have made sure that your son used the washroom before leaving. Childcare is not dll your wife's responsibility only, especially when she too is sick. \n\nYou did nothing to help when your son was vomiting, and it was in fact your brother who even carried your fon inside. \n\nYou should've helped your brother clean the car but you didn't. \n\nYou made a \"joke\" insulting your brother's car and thereby crapping on his achievement. \n\nEveryone in your family should rightfully be mad at you. \n\nIs this even a real post?", "YTA - such a sorry excuse of a father, partner, brother and person.

Maybe you could have driven? \n\nYou blame your wife for asking for stops so that your son can get some fresh air and that she forgot to make him use the bathroom before heading out (Why was that her job anyway? She was sick! You have two functioning arms (I assume), so you should do most of the child-care and house work on the one day your wife is sick with food poisoning! On good days, parenting is a job for both of you, this day it was yours.)\n\nYou are also too lazy to help your brother with cleaning the car. Honestly, he shouldn't have had to ask you to begin with; you should have offered and told him to not bother, because you would do all the cleaning. \n\nAnd why was your son in the car after the arrival anyway? First take out the child, then take care of the luggage!

You should have offered to help clean, especially since you are the one who convinced them to come even though they weren\u2019t feeling well.

I want you to read the thing you just wrote, and really assess whether or not *you* would think YTA if you hadn't written it.\n\n1. Your wife and child were unwell with food poisoning, but you \"convinced\" your wife that they should still take a car journey of a reasonable length for a family dinner regardless, when really they should've stayed at home to recover from their illness.\n2. You got annoyed at your wife because she, who is still feeling unwell from food poisoning, did not make sure that your son, who is still feeling unwell from food poisoning, did not use the washroom before leaving for the journey. And yet, you seemingly did not have any hand in getting your son ready for that journey yourself, knowing that both he and your wife were feeling unwell. Perhaps being directly involved in that process may have helped?\n3. Your brother was kind enough to drive your family to this dinner, and when disaster struck and your son threw up in his car and on his person, when he asked for help dealing with the consequences of that, your *immediate* assumption was that he wanted your *wife* to help him clean up and not you, when he very clearly meant you - since you were sitting on the porch, alone, on a laptop, and I presume your wife was inside *tending to your unwell son*.\n\nI think not only are YTA in this situation, I have a feeling you might just straight-up be an asshole altogether, and if this story reflects your parenting approach and interpersonal skills in general, you're also probably a bad father, a bad husband and a bad brother.

My younger brother (Josh, M34) was also invited. Since Josh and I live in the same city (about a 45-minute drive from our parents' house), he offered to drive me and my family.\r\n\nJosh has been really excited to show us his new car (a Kia K5) and thought that this would be an excellent opportunity. The day before we were supposed to go, both Emily and Ian got a little bit of food poisoning, so they were feeling a bit ill. Emily hinted that she might want to stay home with Ian, but I convinced her to come along as I thought my parents would be upset if they didn't come.\r\n\nThe morning of the trip (yesterday), Josh arrived on schedule and we were off. Josh is a slow driver and stopped a few times at Emily\u2019s request, so Ian could get some fresh air and use the restroom. This turned our 45-minute drive into a 70-minute one. I was getting a little frustrated with Emily, as I had reminded her to make sure Ian used the restroom before we left (she forgot), and I had work related tasks on my laptop to attend to once we arrived at my parents' house.\r\n\nAs we pulled up to my parents' house, Ian began to feel even more nauseous. While Emily and I were unloading the trunk, he vomited inside the car. Josh took him out of his child seat and, as he carried him towards my parents\u2019 house, Ian vomited on Josh again.\r\n\nEmily went inside with them to take care of Ian, and I brought the rest of our belongings into the house. My mom was concerned about Ian and asked me about him. When I mentioned how both he and Emily were not feeling well, she became upset with me and told me that they should have stayed home and recovered.\r\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, I was on the porch working on my laptop. Josh came out of the house with cleaning supplies and said he was going to clean his car. He seemed a bit annoyed. So, I told him that kids can be messy sometimes and that they couldn't be held accountable for situations like this.\r\n\nHe said that he of course didn't blame Ian, but that he would appreciate some help cleaning up. I responded that Emily couldn't be expected to clean as she was ill. He said he didn't plan on asking her as she was ill, and that I should be the one helping him. I explained that I was busy with work and couldn't assist.\r\n\nHe appeared frustrated and started walking away. To ease the tension, I made a joke, suggesting that he was acting like his car was some fancy European model and not just a Kia. He didn't say anything, just shook his head and put on his airpods.\n\nLater, I shared told Emily about this interaction and how Josh was acting strange. She said that she thought I was being overly harsh. My intention wasn't to be rude, but I felt that Josh was being too pushy.\r\n\nAITA?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA to an impressive extent. Your brother was doing you a favor by giving you a ride. You were the one that decided it would be a good idea to go, even with food poisoning. You so fully assume that your child is your wife's responsiblity that you did not even understand your brother may mean you. You did not lift a hand to clean the mess your child has created, did not even consider taking 15 minutes off work, and then had the audacity to take a dig at your brother's car model.
