Naturally I do groceries and dinners everyday.\nAnd for all this I ask him  for few things - to not leave his laundry around house, not misplace everything he picks up, not leave his hair in the shower drain (he has an amazing curly hair but these are everywhere, I have to swipe them everyday) and TO PUT DOWN THE DAMN TOILET SEAT. \n\nSo today we were reorganizing some stuff and first we argued about placement of some CDs and DVDs he has to sell (these are laying around for at least half of a year) because if we were to put them where he wanted another half of a year will pass and I am the one to swipe dust off of them. After that we argued few more times mostly because I was hurrying him up ( he tends to just walk around and look busy not doing anything at all while I do basically everything). And with all of this I put up on daily basis, he complains and sigh over anything I ask him to do, even fold his own laundry.\n\nThen he angrily went upstairs where our toilet is and after some time used a toilet and came down to continue tidying up.

You\u2019re working full time AND balancing household duties, it sounds like he expects you to be his second mom. If he\u2019s whining about doing basic tasks, he needs to grow up and realize no one\u2019s gonna be his full-time maid while also working a full-time job without receiving any respect. If you plan on having children with this man it seems like he\u2019ll expect you to take the role of working housewife since you mostly work remotely. I\u2019m not telling you to leave him, but he clearly either forgot what it\u2019s like keeping a home clean and comfortable or refuses to acknowledge your efforts probably while thinking \u201cwhy does my fianc\u00e9e complain so much, it\u2019s so easy clean and cook, etc, I\u2019m tired from work she should be focused on keeping me happy\u201d meanwhile you\u2019re contributing more than your fair share of hard work in this relationship. P.s regarding the toilet seat, I honestly recommend both of you shutting the lid completely before flushing and then opening the lid when you need to use it, two steps for everyone plus it helps with containing the particles from going everywhere in the bathroom.\n\nRepost because mods took my original comment down for calling him a _child mb I guess, didn\u2019t think it was uncivil.", "NTA - it sounds like the honeymoon is over before you even get to it :( please think about what you want your relationship to look like and then have a talk with him about it", "NTA.

While gets to come home from work and just relax.\n\n\nIt sounds like life would be easier for you if he weren't in it.

You do everything whole working and he can't even put a toilet seat down?  Have you no self respect?", "NTA. And I will argue that he CAN put the toilet seat down and here\u2019s my reason why - he CHOOSES to stand when he pees, he could sit down to pee, there\u2019s nothing preventing him from doing that.

He has the time to do laundry at his own pace, he can do minimal tasks especially something as simple as putting the toilet seat down. If he forgot it, it\u2019s not like something in the kitchen will burn, he can go and put it back down. He has the time to because his future wifey is taking care of everything else.

Only thing the cleaning add is to add brownie points to OP and make people more sympathetic to her side.  \n\nSeriously does who does the cleaning has anything to do with of the seat should be up or down?", "I fall in every time!

Those \u201cbrownie points\u201d? no, they aren\u2019t brownie points they are context. Her fianc\u00e9 has barely any other commitments at home he can at LEAST do the few small tasks that THEY AGREED ON. Did you even read it fully? She CALMLY confronted him and he tells her to cater to HIS needs despite him doing jackshit around the house, and after he treats her like a maid she rightfully calls him gross and entitled because he is. She shouldn\u2019t be expected to do absolutely everything for him including putting down the damn toilet seat that he could\u2019ve done in one easy step before washing his hands. Unless you lack the basic reading comprehension of a 9th grader in America, you think \u201coh, we should ignore all the context because she\u2019s obviously the asshole, she should ofc put down the toilet seat if she wants to use it\u201d is how normal, respectful people think? No, why? Because it\u2019s basic manners to put the seat down or shut the whole lid even. Respectfully, your argument is stupid I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s true and someone had to tell you.

The role reversal doesn\u2019t matter in this case as you are asking hypothetically. Do not try to play the \u201cif he did this and she did that\u201d game with me I\u2019m not interested.

You realize he needs the seat down too right? To take a shit? Seriously, in one eye and out the other. This is a win for both of them if he stops making it seem like he\u2019s a special case when our of their combined four bodily functions 2 for urine and 2 for shits, it\u2019s 1/4 that need that toilet seat up. The toilet seat would be more beneficial to both of them if it were down. Boom, are you happy? You like the math? You\u2019re welcome.

I'm a dude.", "Bro \ud83d\ude2d I\u2019ll just write it in points at this rate. Not that I can anyways because mobile sucks. -The main question is about whether or not she\u2019s the AH for wanting him to do one simple thing.
