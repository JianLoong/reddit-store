But if you\u2019re hitting snooze and it\u2019s going off more than once over the course of a half hour, that\u2019s really annoying. I\u2019ve had roommates and neighbors who insisted on setting alarms and then snoozing for up to an hour.

Do you have sleep apnoea or stay up till very late or some other reason you\u2019re so tired?", "NTA Tell your neighbor to get earplugs and welcome to apartment living.

Your sleep issues definitely need to be checked out by a doctor. If you've gone to see a doctor already, go see another one. Having your alarm go off for half an hour is excessive, which is probably indicative of a larger issue with your quality of sleep.\n\nBut having an alarm at 8:30am is very late, so I have no idea why your neighbour is being so pissy at you. If it was 5 or 6am, I would understand not wanting to hear an alarm for half an hour. But by 8:30am, most normal people are either about to leave for work or already have. Then the comments about noise when you have guests over? This person sounds like a jaded a-hole who hates the world and will find the smallest reason to complain.\n\nI think one piece of advice I'll give you is only having a vibrating alarm instead of a sound. The vibrations should still be able to wake you up. If you've tried that and it doesn't work though, I've got nothing.", "NAH you could also be playing the drums for half an hour at that time.

I'd jump up when my alarm goes off for a second, but hers meant I was awake from 7.30am everyday knowing I'd only feel worse if I did doze off again just to be woken again. We have a great relationship but I mean it drove me mad, like an absolute pyscho, I couldn't stand her, I was actually so angry at her constantly and it got to a point where I'd just cry in the mornings out of frustration, it really had an impact on my mental health.\n\nSo, my advice... Set 1 alarm and get up as soon as it goes off. Or look into alarm clocks for heavy sleepers, there's ones for your wrist that vibrates etc. YTA but hoping that changes", "Perhaps you should chat to your GP and look into a sleep study?", "That's what I was thinking. If he's sleeping 12 hours regularly and it's that hard to wake up, I wouldn't be surprised if it was something like sleep apnea."]}
