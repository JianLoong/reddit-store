I get it, I also have a really hard time waking up in the morning, but that's your responsibility, not your neighbors. Have you looked into those alarms on wheels that you have to chase around the room after you hit snooze the first time? they sound ridiculous but I have one and it's actually very helpful for me. Also might want to consider talking to your Dr. About this if you haven't yet", "YTA and need to develop a pre sleep routine and a morning routine to change your body's relationship with sleep", "You might look into alarms that don't require sound. My smartwatch vibrates on my wrist. They make ones that vibrate your bed. Also, see a doctor for your waking/sleep issues, you might have a medical condition. There are now many other types of alarms you can find out there other than sound ones. Try them out on your days off, but definitely talk to your doctor.", "I was going to say N T A until I read that you're letting the alarm go off for pretty much 30 solid minutes. YTA and that's ridiculous. If you're that hard to get up, you need to figure out a different method. There are watch alarms you can set where the watch will vibrate your wrist to wake you up, since your 30 minute alarm isn't good enough, maybe you need to change up how you wake up. This isn't sustainable with shared living. If you ever have an SO they will not put up with this, if you ever have any other roommates other than your brother who is a saint to put up with it, they will give you the same complaints. And the fact a NEIGHBOR can hear your alarm? That's really ridiculous. I have an alarm set for 5 AM every morning. My partner never even hears it and he's in bed with me. You're just being disrespectful/rude.", "I thought it was like 4 alarms 10 minutes apart not one alarm blasting for 30 minutes.", "I don't know what are the rules at their building, but where I live you can work (loudly) from 8am til 3pm so the alarm would be the least of my problem. I vote NTA, it doesn't ring too early.", "1am at latest", "Wanna say that some people need to snooze a lot cause they sleep soo deep they are otherwise physically unable to wake up. Op is the asshole for having the amarm ringing without pause for 30 minutes. But people who snooze a lot and has a resonable break between the snoozes are not assholes.", "Great suggestion! \n\nI feel for this person struggling with sleep/waking issues while having to live in an apartment.

Hopefully they'll be able to make some of them work.", "can't. i have to study till i go to bed for 2 months because of my exams\n\ni already get 7.30 hours of sleep", "I tried the alarm on my fitbit, and was unimpressed. The alarm on my phone does a much better job of waking me. Although, unlike OP, my alarm goes off for about 10 seconds before being shut off. I also get my butt directly out of bed because I know that if I don't, I will fall back asleep.", "i answered why i can't go to bed earlier and it's already 7.30 hours of sleep. for my age that's more thab enough\n\nwhenever i feel tired i take a nap during the day or on my off days don't really have an issue with that", "Although I agree that the OP is YTA, as someone with sleep disorders I can say that \u2019GROWING UP\u2019 does absolutely nothing to wake me up. I\u2019ve spent a lifetime managing these disorders and I can assure you that it is not a matter of simply deciding to start adulting.", "Feel free to tell my brain to \"grow up\" since apparently it never got the memo and can sleep through literal earthquakes and emergency sirens \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Leaving an alarm blaring for 30 minutes is unreasonable", "Having an alarm go off for 30 mins is not reasonable.", "They make \u201csunrise\u201d alarms - there\u2019s a light on the clock that starts dim and increases brightness, hitting full brightness at the time you set your alarm (mimicking a sunrise). They work pretty well, actually, you have the option of using an alarm sound at the time you set if for in addition to the lighting or just going with the lighting only. Might try that or if you have a smart watch, those can have the vibrating alarm just right on your wrist so you actually feel it more.\n\nThere\u2019s also an app that has you keep your phone close to where your head is when you sleep - tracks your sleep (can connect with smart watches) and the alarm will go off at the best point in your sleep cycle. You set the latest you want to be awake by, and the app will track when you\u2019re not in deep REM closest to that time to wake you up.", "I use an alarm app called, \"I can't wake up\"", "My neighbour used to wake me up doing this and they were in a whole different freaking house.

Maybe try to go to bed earlier so that you aren't torturing everyone around you with 30 minutes of alarm sounds.", "That's just not true. First, snoozing is a really bad habit that just makes you more tired and waste time since you don't recuperate at all while snoozing. And second, disturbing everyone around you and making them lose sleep with avoidable behavior does make you an asshole, even if you're not intentionally trying to ruin their day.\n\nI can say that even though I myself was the asshole for years. I used to snooze like a motherfucker because I would hit the snooze button while still asleep without even realizing. Well guess what, just move the alarm out of reach so you need to get up to turn it off and look at that! You're awake now.", "It\u2019s obviously not enough", "Everyone\u2019s sleep needs are different. If it takes you 30 minutes of alarm every day to wake, then the 7.30 hours you\u2019re getting isn\u2019t sufficient for you (regardless of what is the norm is for your age). I understand the challenges of juggling commitments - I work full time and study (and have friends, family, hobbies, fitness to balance). It can be a lot, and finding a schedule that works includes considering sleep. It takes work and trying lots of things until you find something that works for you. That might mean swapping day time naps for day time study, and ditching the post-study midnight YT sesh. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other tweaks you could try to find something that means no more 30 minutes of alarm. If you won\u2019t do it for your neighbour\u2019s sanity, do it for yourself. It sounds boring as hell but everything in life is easier to manage when you\u2019re well rested.", "Go to bed earlier and get up earlier. It might not be compatible with you sleep rhythm.

Have you considered another shift?  Are you a student?", "But are they driving their family and neighbors insane every morning with their alarms? You have to do what's right for your body, and it sounds like you need over 8 hours to feel rested.", "Sleeping less to study more is not a sound learning strategy.\n\nYou need enough sleep to be able to retain information and store it in your long term memory.\n\nI know a lot of schools and universities do not teach sound learning strategies and that's a shame. \n\nSo from a teacher who died try to make sure her student know what strategies are useful and which are not here is a short list.\n\nWhat not to do:\nStudy for too long without a break. \nSleep less.\nOnly read the information you want to learn.\n\nWhat you should do:\n\nSleep as much as you need. Being rested well make it easier for your brain to retain information. It will also make it easier to distinguish between the important information and the unimportant side drizzle. \n\nTake a break often. The recommended time for doing a study task is no more than 20 minutes. After that your brain needs a break. You can take a five to ten minute break, with a longer half for break every 3 hours. Or you can switch study activity, change the subject you're studying (works well in high school) or learning activity you're doing (works well in university) and then take a 30 minutes break after 2 hours.\n\nUse a lot of different learning activities/strategies. For example, reading the text out loud to yourself, write out a recap, make study cards with questions and answers, quiz a friend, be quizzed by a friend, make a mindmap, make/remake questions/problems (homework assignments and look online for more work), watch YouTube videos about the subject, highlight the important information, read over your recap and mindmap and see if you still understand everything you have written down, if not not, look up the information and reread the paragraph is about.

The watch and phone both alarm multiple times, and the phone has multiple sounds. \n\n80-90% of the time the first three don't wake me up fully and I only wake up to the Sonic Boom.
