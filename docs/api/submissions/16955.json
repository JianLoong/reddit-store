It's hard enough to get a doctor to see you for serious issues, they won't help you with \"I need to use the snooze button to get up\". They'd laugh you out of the room. Health care is steadily declining in the UK (but I also know other European countries where it's the same issue), soon I might not even have a GP as many of them quit one by one.\n\nIf I don't use the snooze button I won't wake up. If I don't wake up I will miss work and not get paid and finally be sacked. Than I'll be homeless. All just because I didn't use my snooze button because someone thinks it's annoying. (My neighbours have never complained, because I don't complain to them about a bit of noise now and than either.) You cannot expect other people to follow your schedule of life and to never have to endure a bit of \"annoyance\" by someone else just because you don't have the same problem or experience things differently.\n\nI could just as well say \"just sleep through the noise, it's really easy to not wake up, or just go back to sleep it's really not that difficult\". But that would dismiss that other people are different than me and what's easy for me is not necessarily easy for them too.", "I mean it's not a matter of opinion, it's fact proven by science. Just google it and you'll see. In order to get rest from sleeping you need to be in deep sleep for a certain time, not just a few minutes.", "I have the same problem and tried the putting it across the room technique. I thought I was going crazy, constantly thinking I set it but in the morning it wasn't waking me up, until I had friends spend the night. Turns out I was getting up, walking across the room, turning it off, and going back to sleep, all without actually waking up. My friends tried to remind me that I had work that morning and I very aggressively told them \"Fuck off, I'm not going,\" then returned to bed. I have no memory of any of this, but sleepwalking does run in the family. Pretty sure I only do it to silence my alarms though. A sunrise alarm clock has been helpful, probably because it gradually brings you out of sleep rather than jolting you out of a REM cycle.", "Thanks!", "Thank you, I\u2019ll check them out!", "Thank you, I\u2019ll definitely have a look!", "Actually, those same studies have proven that if someone has repeatedly interrupted REM sleep, they will drop back into it rapidly, meaning even 2-3 minutes can be quite important. It was a pretty cool study where they followed on-call medical personnel and some other professions that often had 1) interrupted sleep 2) were expected to wake up quickly and be 'on' in minutes \n\nSo yeah, snoozing can absolutely be helpful, especially considering that a large chunk of the nation is clinically sleep deprived.", "This attitude is a real problem for like a 3rd of the populace. Yes OP is the AH for subjecting their neighbor to half hour alarms every day, but the fact OP naturally sleeps later than you and doesn't wake up ahead of his alarm is not something to be shocked about. First off, some people are morning people and naturally wake up early, and some people are night owls *who still have the same sleep needs as everyone else* ie probably need 7-9hrs of sleep a day, and of course some people are between the two in peak alertness times. If everyone was a morning person we'd all have been eaten by sabertooth tigers at 2am millennia ago. If you are a young person who naturally needs 9+ hours of sleep and a night owl you might naturally sleep most of the day away when left to develop your own sleep cycle.\n\nAnd I haven't even yet mentioned people with health issues, sleep disorders, and 2nd or 3rd shifters. Or worse, the people with variable schedules.  Anyway, don't assume that just because 6am is a natural wake up time for you that is or should be most people's experience.\n\nI know you didn't make a value judgement on OP or call them lazy or anything, but it's really pervasive in our culture where business hours really influence what people consider \"reasonable hours\" and how they negatively view people with different schedules.", "Sleep apnea", "Some of us have different circadian rhythms and literally cannot go to sleep early enough to be awake before alarms go off, especially since society operates on a morning person schedule.", "That disorder always gives me the impression that doctors decided to make differing circadian rhythms a diagnosable disorder because social norms consider sleeping in to be lazy and staying up until 2a or later to be childish or whatever (only what youthful college students can get away with).\n\nI\u2019m not maliciously trying to diminish/deny the diagnosis & know it has some real shitty symptoms that negatively impact your life in major ways. Diagnosis gains access to treatments to better help people live their life more conventionally (so you can get paid and still be able to shop & run errands & see friends/family). The diagnosis isn\u2019t what irks me, just the social implications of not maintaining a farmer\u2019s sleep schedule.\n\nThe fact that you changed time zones and it didn\u2019t help makes sense to me, regardless of someone just being a \u201cnight owl\u201d or actually having an impactful sleep disorder. Depending on severity, there may be a short time period where it may have \u201chelped\u201d but really that\u2019s adjusting to the new timezone. Time as we know & relate to it now is a bit of an arbitrary social construct, but that doesn\u2019t mean the clocks around us don\u2019t impact how we internally perceive what time it actually is & what we should be doing. Especially how the time on the clock relates to the sunrise/sunset of each day, which is influenced by geographic location & time of year. \n\nThe only difference I can see moving might make is a scenario where someone moves to the far far north where the sun never sets for a portion of the summer & never rises for a portion of the winter. And I wouldn\u2019t expect that to be a positive difference in sleep patterns. It fucks with people who don\u2019t even have sleep disorders, so I imagine those that do would just be constantly confused, tried, frustrated, and eventually lose grip on reality because of the constant denial after checking the time or simply forgetting to ever check the time because, hey, it\u2019s still light out/dark out; there\u2019s no way I need to go to sleep/be somewhere.", "But if you can afford snoozing and still not being late, you'd be much better off just setting your alarm later. Also, if you have your own house, do what you want with your snoozing, but this post is about waking up your neighbors with repeated snoozing, which is undeniably a problem. Snooze how you like as long as you're not ruining everyone else's sleep. The benefits of snoozing are not great enough to make it worth waking up everyone else.

Even if the neighbour works graveyard, he can\u2019t expect everyone to conform to his sleep schedule and other people living their lives. The other noisier neighbours probably make more noise than your alarm. And complaining about kids who are over maybe twice a year is ridiculous, suck it up, it happens rarely. \n\nOn another note, definitely get your sleep checked by a doctor or something, you probably have something going on there. I can be the same sometimes, and my sleep is not healthy so you should get some help with that. Try switching up the alarm sounds so you don\u2019t get too used to them, might help your brain not tune it out for so long. Or try setting your phone with a vibrate and put it under your pillow.

One day I had absolutely had it with my brother. I had unplugged his alarm and threw it down the hallway.
