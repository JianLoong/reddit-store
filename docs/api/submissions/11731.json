It might seem a little hobby for you but she's going out of her way to try to learn something new(to the point of attending cooking classes) and your input back for her was to try doing something else? Do you not hear what that sounds like? It sounds like you're telling her she isn't good enough to even learn this skill. If you truly love your mom, you would support her and give her some good constructive criticism.", "YTA you were being rude. Its good that she actually wants to improve, so why break her down, instead of build her up? She was there every step of you learning to do stuff.", "Imagine dedicating your entire life to caring for your family, but the little asshole you raised can't even fake being thankful.", "YTA- I doubt your mother has ever told you to just give up on something you wanted to get better at. You can afford her the same courtesy. You could have told her that her lasagna sucked without telling her she is culinarily hopeless.", "YTA. The reason she was never offended before is probably because she knew it wasn\u2019t her strong suit and had never had lessons. This time, she is actively trying to improve her skills and you are putting her down. You don\u2019t need to lie and tell her it was delicious, but you don\u2019t have to be so negative as to tell her to give up.", "YTA you suck op", "YTA\n\nI will cut you some small slack for being a teenager but you're also an adult now and perfectly capable of being tactful and not hurting people.\n\nYour mother knows she does not have cooking skills. Your jokes in the past have probably rankled a little, but she wasn't trying to cook for you so it wasn't an issue. She could probably agree and laugh at herself.\n\nNow however she has applied herself, she is going to classes to learn, and she made an effort into making a nice meal to you because she felt more confident. You took a giant dump on that confidence. You literally told her to QUIT because she cooked one bland meal after starting to go to classes.\n\nIf she'd gone to painting classes and done her first ever painting would you say you should never paint again?!  I bet every time you weren't amazing at something the first time you did it she didn't say \"oh well son, you fell off your bike, guess you suck at cycling, just quit.\"\n\nThere is a way of being kind and being tactful, and you should employ that ability. You could have said \"I'm really glad you cooked for me! It didn't quite have enough seasoning for my taste though, maybe next time you could use more x and x.\" You could offer to share a recipe, hell you could offer to cook with her and give her pointers. You could turn this into a nice family thing. Instead you told her she should just never try again.

A little more oregano maybe?\u201d Or something to that extent. \u201cThe cheese is really good and melty but I think the noodles got overdone\u201d. \n\nAs for why she is upset - there\u2019s a bit in the Simpsons where Bart, who always gets a failing grade, studies his butt off.

You\u2019ve gotten plenty of f\u2019s before\u201d and he replies \u201cyeah but this time I TRIED.\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s trying. She\u2019s learning.

You were an AH.\n\nBeing honest you could have told her \"it needs more flavor and its slightly overcooked\" and then give her some encouragement to keep trying.  \n\n\nIt sounds like crapping on her cooking has become a pass time in your household. Ditch that habit from your father. Its shitty behavior. Grow up and support your mom when she wants to try improving herself.", "Dude, YTA. The way you phrased it made ME feel bad. She's starting to get older, continuing to learn new skills and have hobbies is important throughout your life and I'm so sad that you took a moment of her trying to learn and be independent and shit on her for it. I'm sure she never looked at you and said \"you should really give up, I think you kinda suck at what you do honestly\" in the 18 years she's been there as your mother. I'll never understand people who disrespect their mom like this.\n\nThe lasagna might have been bland, but you're simply a bit rotten and that's far worse.", "YTA. She's learning.

I told her that it was awful and that she's just not cut out for it.\n\n  \nAITA? \n\nnot to mention she was *excited* for **you** to try it.", "Yeah YTA. It's a hobby and she's had \"a few lessons\" - should we all just give up on learning anything new if we're not automatically good at it?  \n\n\nLearning a new skill when you're older is damn hard, and the least you could have done is given thoughtful, constructive criticism (i.e. maybe cooked the noodles a little less next time) rather than tearing your mom down and hiding behind the \"it's just a joke!\" excuse.", "YTA since you didn't mention you were going to step up and cook all meals so she didn't have to. You're an adult expecting personal chefs the rest of your life?", "YTA\n\nYou can honestly without being rude. Maybe you should take those cooking classes with your mom. It's an important life skill.", "Yta. Other comments have already explained where you went wrong, so I'll only say go apologize again. \"I'm just telling it like it is\" is code for \"I don't care about your feelings.\" That line was like rubbing salt into the wound.", "YTA She's trying to improve and you and your dad are constantly bullying her. How would you feel if someone talked to you like that when you we're struggling with something? Maybe try to to into the kitchen and figure out where the problem is and if she's just got lousy recipes or she's misunderstanding something.", "YTA. \n\nShe tried to show you something she was working on and proud of trying. And on her first attempt you tell her to find a different hobby??? But you're just \"telling it like it is\" so that's okay? \n\nYou are aware that there's a way to tell someone that you don't care for their cooking without sounding like a complete tool and shitting on their self esteem, right? \n\nI'm proud of your mom. I'm excited she's trying something new, and she's trying her best. I just hope that she keeps continuing to try despite your AH remarks. She deserves better support.", "YTA  \n  \n1. She cooked for you once and you dismissed her efforts  \n2. Cooking can take practice like anything else  \n3. You shot her dreams down without giving her any benefit here  \n4. You were rude   \n5. Why on earth were you surprised by her reaction, see 4...  \n6. Be nice to your Mom next time \n7. Oh and go apologize", "YTA. Your Mom is trying to learn something new, she put a lot of time and effort into making something, and you gave honest feedback. That's OK. That's how you learn and get better. The reason YTA is for the part after the feedback, that could have been constructive, when you told her that she should just give up. That is a really lousy way to think about life and it was a pretty awful thing for you to say.", "YTA yes that was rude of you. She's just learning right now, and she took the time and effort to make you a meal. You could tell her it could use some more seasoning or a little less time in the oven, that's still telling it like it is. Nobody learns to cook overnight. Praise her efforts and thank your mom.", "YTA. She's in cooking classes and presumably she's making lasagna from a recipe, not sure it could be as bad as what you're saying.  But even if so, it's rude to make that kind of remark to someone trying a new skill.", "YTA\n\nIt's one thing to be honest about how the food tastes in that moment\n\nYou went into asshole territory by then trying to tell her she's wasting her time and should find a new hobby\n\nHow was it the worst lasagna you've ever had? Too cheese? The noodles not cooked properly? Too salty? What was it?\n\nYou gave no actionable critiques about the food. Sounds like you just hate your mom. Get therapy.", "YTA. What is the matter with you? Why are you so mean to your mom? She obviously cares which is why she\u2019s attending cooking classes. She cares about getting better. I would imagine she has been offended by your jokes before and now that she\u2019s finally taking classes she has the courage to speak up about it. \n\nPractice some damn sensitivity. Learn how to give constructive criticism. Maybe try the \u201cfeedback sandwich\u201d next time - give positive feedback, constructive feedback, then positive feedback/reaffirming the original positive feedback.", "Cooking is not a hobby it's a requirement to life itself.  Maybe you need to get off you ass and work with your mom in the kitchen during meal prep time to ensure the meal itself is going to turn out tasty. The learning curve takes time to prepare food, and your mom is in that curve. You come off as an entitled spoiled son. One day, you'll be the one dealing with your teenage child telling you that something you were proud of sucked.

Did your mom tell you to give up every time you tried something new and weren\u2019t perfect at it right away? I\u2019m guessing probably not since you can read and write well enough to be on Reddit.

Are you sure she\u2019s in on the \u201cjoke?\u201d Maybe she\u2019s sick of being told she can\u2019t do things by her own family and I wouldn\u2019t blame her for it.", "Cook your own stuff then, kiddo! YTA", "YTA.  Everyone can be a good cook. It just takes time and practice. Tell her it may have been cooked too long or could use more flavour.  You\u2019ve been spoiled by a family chef.

Cos i can, im actually really fkn good at it, and it took a long time and a lot of effort to be so \n\nCooking is a skill homie, even people that are naturally gifted have a lot of work to do to develop it. Would you tell someone that had taken like 5 art classes to quit painting?? \n\nReal talk it kinda sounds like you dont like your mum trying to learn how to cook and thats just kinda weird actually. Telling her to quit was frfr just mean. Literally why would you do that?? You could have told her what would have made the dish better instead. Did it need more garlic and oregano?? Was it overcooked as in burnt or did she cook the pasta too long?? \n\nStop being unsupportive and mean to your mum omg.
