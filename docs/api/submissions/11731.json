It might seem a little hobby for you but she's going out of her way to try to learn something new(to the point of attending cooking classes) and your input back for her was to try doing something else? Do you not hear what that sounds like? It sounds like you're telling her she isn't good enough to even learn this skill. If you truly love your mom, you would support her and give her some good constructive criticism.", "YTA you were being rude. Its good that she actually wants to improve, so why break her down, instead of build her up? She was there every step of you learning to do stuff.", "Imagine dedicating your entire life to caring for your family, but the little asshole you raised can't even fake being thankful.", "YTA- I doubt your mother has ever told you to just give up on something you wanted to get better at. You can afford her the same courtesy. You could have told her that her lasagna sucked without telling her she is culinarily hopeless.", "YTA. The reason she was never offended before is probably because she knew it wasn\u2019t her strong suit and had never had lessons. This time, she is actively trying to improve her skills and you are putting her down. You don\u2019t need to lie and tell her it was delicious, but you don\u2019t have to be so negative as to tell her to give up.", "YTA you suck op", "YTA\n\nI will cut you some small slack for being a teenager but you're also an adult now and perfectly capable of being tactful and not hurting people.\n\nYour mother knows she does not have cooking skills. Your jokes in the past have probably rankled a little, but she wasn't trying to cook for you so it wasn't an issue. She could probably agree and laugh at herself.\n\nNow however she has applied herself, she is going to classes to learn, and she made an effort into making a nice meal to you because she felt more confident. You took a giant dump on that confidence. You literally told her to QUIT because she cooked one bland meal after starting to go to classes.\n\nIf she'd gone to painting classes and done her first ever painting would you say you should never paint again?!  I bet every time you weren't amazing at something the first time you did it she didn't say \"oh well son, you fell off your bike, guess you suck at cycling, just quit.\"\n\nThere is a way of being kind and being tactful, and you should employ that ability. You could have said \"I'm really glad you cooked for me! It didn't quite have enough seasoning for my taste though, maybe next time you could use more x and x.\" You could offer to share a recipe, hell you could offer to cook with her and give her pointers. You could turn this into a nice family thing. Instead you told her she should just never try again.

A little more oregano maybe?\u201d Or something to that extent. \u201cThe cheese is really good and melty but I think the noodles got overdone\u201d. \n\nAs for why she is upset - there\u2019s a bit in the Simpsons where Bart, who always gets a failing grade, studies his butt off.

You\u2019ve gotten plenty of f\u2019s before\u201d and he replies \u201cyeah but this time I TRIED.\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s trying. She\u2019s learning.

You were an AH.\n\nBeing honest you could have told her \"it needs more flavor and its slightly overcooked\" and then give her some encouragement to keep trying.  \n\n\nIt sounds like crapping on her cooking has become a pass time in your household. Ditch that habit from your father. Its shitty behavior. Grow up and support your mom when she wants to try improving herself.", "Dude, YTA. The way you phrased it made ME feel bad. She's starting to get older, continuing to learn new skills and have hobbies is important throughout your life and I'm so sad that you took a moment of her trying to learn and be independent and shit on her for it. I'm sure she never looked at you and said \"you should really give up, I think you kinda suck at what you do honestly\" in the 18 years she's been there as your mother. I'll never understand people who disrespect their mom like this.\n\nThe lasagna might have been bland, but you're simply a bit rotten and that's far worse.", "YTA. She's learning.

I told her that it was awful and that she's just not cut out for it.\n\n  \nAITA? \n\nnot to mention she was *excited* for **you** to try it.", "Yeah YTA. It's a hobby and she's had \"a few lessons\" - should we all just give up on learning anything new if we're not automatically good at it?  \n\n\nLearning a new skill when you're older is damn hard, and the least you could have done is given thoughtful, constructive criticism (i.e. maybe cooked the noodles a little less next time) rather than tearing your mom down and hiding behind the \"it's just a joke!\" excuse.", "YTA since you didn't mention you were going to step up and cook all meals so she didn't have to. You're an adult expecting personal chefs the rest of your life?", "YTA\n\nYou can honestly without being rude. Maybe you should take those cooking classes with your mom. It's an important life skill.", "Yta. Other comments have already explained where you went wrong, so I'll only say go apologize again. \"I'm just telling it like it is\" is code for \"I don't care about your feelings.\" That line was like rubbing salt into the wound.", "YTA She's trying to improve and you and your dad are constantly bullying her. How would you feel if someone talked to you like that when you we're struggling with something? Maybe try to to into the kitchen and figure out where the problem is and if she's just got lousy recipes or she's misunderstanding something.", "YTA. \n\nShe tried to show you something she was working on and proud of trying. And on her first attempt you tell her to find a different hobby??? But you're just \"telling it like it is\" so that's okay? \n\nYou are aware that there's a way to tell someone that you don't care for their cooking without sounding like a complete tool and shitting on their self esteem, right? \n\nI'm proud of your mom. I'm excited she's trying something new, and she's trying her best. I just hope that she keeps continuing to try despite your AH remarks. She deserves better support.", "YTA  \n  \n1. She cooked for you once and you dismissed her efforts  \n2. Cooking can take practice like anything else  \n3. You shot her dreams down without giving her any benefit here  \n4. You were rude   \n5. Why on earth were you surprised by her reaction, see 4...  \n6. Be nice to your Mom next time \n7. Oh and go apologize", "YTA. Your Mom is trying to learn something new, she put a lot of time and effort into making something, and you gave honest feedback. That's OK. That's how you learn and get better. The reason YTA is for the part after the feedback, that could have been constructive, when you told her that she should just give up. That is a really lousy way to think about life and it was a pretty awful thing for you to say.", "YTA yes that was rude of you. She's just learning right now, and she took the time and effort to make you a meal. You could tell her it could use some more seasoning or a little less time in the oven, that's still telling it like it is. Nobody learns to cook overnight. Praise her efforts and thank your mom.", "YTA. She's in cooking classes and presumably she's making lasagna from a recipe, not sure it could be as bad as what you're saying.  But even if so, it's rude to make that kind of remark to someone trying a new skill.", "YTA\n\nIt's one thing to be honest about how the food tastes in that moment\n\nYou went into asshole territory by then trying to tell her she's wasting her time and should find a new hobby\n\nHow was it the worst lasagna you've ever had? Too cheese? The noodles not cooked properly? Too salty? What was it?\n\nYou gave no actionable critiques about the food. Sounds like you just hate your mom. Get therapy.", "YTA. What is the matter with you? Why are you so mean to your mom? She obviously cares which is why she\u2019s attending cooking classes. She cares about getting better. I would imagine she has been offended by your jokes before and now that she\u2019s finally taking classes she has the courage to speak up about it. \n\nPractice some damn sensitivity. Learn how to give constructive criticism. Maybe try the \u201cfeedback sandwich\u201d next time - give positive feedback, constructive feedback, then positive feedback/reaffirming the original positive feedback.", "Cooking is not a hobby it's a requirement to life itself.  Maybe you need to get off you ass and work with your mom in the kitchen during meal prep time to ensure the meal itself is going to turn out tasty. The learning curve takes time to prepare food, and your mom is in that curve. You come off as an entitled spoiled son. One day, you'll be the one dealing with your teenage child telling you that something you were proud of sucked. YTA.", "Let me guess: you are the type who brags about being \"honest\" rather than nice.\n\n>Then I told her that not everyone can be a great cook and suggested that she may want to try a different hobby instead. \n\nYou do realise that nobody is perfect at something they do for the first time?

Did your mom tell you to give up every time you tried something new and weren\u2019t perfect at it right away? I\u2019m guessing probably not since you can read and write well enough to be on Reddit.

Are you sure she\u2019s in on the \u201cjoke?\u201d Maybe she\u2019s sick of being told she can\u2019t do things by her own family and I wouldn\u2019t blame her for it.", "Cook your own stuff then, kiddo! YTA", "YTA.  Everyone can be a good cook. It just takes time and practice. Tell her it may have been cooked too long or could use more flavour.  You\u2019ve been spoiled by a family chef.

Cos i can, im actually really fkn good at it, and it took a long time and a lot of effort to be so \n\nCooking is a skill homie, even people that are naturally gifted have a lot of work to do to develop it. Would you tell someone that had taken like 5 art classes to quit painting?? \n\nReal talk it kinda sounds like you dont like your mum trying to learn how to cook and thats just kinda weird actually. Telling her to quit was frfr just mean. Literally why would you do that?? You could have told her what would have made the dish better instead. Did it need more garlic and oregano?? Was it overcooked as in burnt or did she cook the pasta too long?? \n\nStop being unsupportive and mean to your mum omg.

Telling her to give up because she wasn't instantly awesome at it is a seriously AH thing to do.\n\nYes, she's still offended. Because YOU WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY TO BE OFFENSIVE!!!! \n\nI wouldn't want a jackhole like you around, either!", "NTA People say it's rude to tell someone you don't like their cooking, but what does lying about it accomplish? Make them offer you more in the future. When someone makes something that comes out terrible AND solicits your opinion, you HAVE to tell them the truth.\n\nNow, treating a bad cook as less valuable of a person? Telling them it's their duty to be a better cook? Nitpicking a genuinely good dish? Bossing the cook around? Demanding they cook and then complaining? All bad and unacceptable, and none of which apply here.", "Dude are you INSANE?  Women are super sensitive about that!  You might as well have called her an ugly hag!\n\nEven if it sucks just sneak some salt onto it and look forward to the day you move out.  There's no way you can do this in a way that will come out well; just apologize", "YTA It's a hobby, not a career. You don't have to be good at something to enjoy doing it. With practise and *constructive* criticism, if she is open to it, she might get better. Try being supportive, ask if you can cook with her and give her some helpful tips, like tasting as you go etc. Putting people down for not being good at something they are trying to improve on and enjoy doing is low", "Disrespectful to your mother and think it's funny.", "YTA\n\nYou sound just as entitled as I imagine someone who grew up with a private chef would be.", "NTA. Here's the main reason why: it was undercooked.\n\nIt's one thing for something to be bad, which seems to be the norm with her and something you and your dad have joked about. But to give something undercooked to your kid? And risk them getting food poisoning?\n\nI understand not knowing the trick to certain flavours, how to blend them and so on. That takes trial and error. I basically learned how to cook this way, and trust me, some of my cooking when I was getting the hang of it was plain awful.\n\nBut I've *never* fed anyone anything that was undercooked. That's just a very basic rule.\n\nIt's not like you told her \"hey, I'd rather eat shit. Why do you even bother?\"\n\nYou suggested, after eating an undercooked meal that traditionally has ground beef in it, that she try her hand at something else.\n\nRegardless, her feelings are clearly hurt, so maybe suggest cooking with her? It'll be a good bonding experience and you'll learn something from it. Maybe she needs that extra set of eyes to help her cut back on the basil or make sure something is properly cooked through.", "He could ask his butler to write a letter of apology.", "They had a personal chef, all her \"dedication\" was to raising him(unless they also had full time nannies) and this is what she raised(maybe). Not too sure what OP is supposed to thankful for. Terrible lasagna?", "You can thank someone for cooking for you, but you can't lie and say it tastes good, or they'll just make it for you again.", "YTA do you think your first attempts to walk were great? Aren't you lucky your mother didn't tell to give up because you just weren't any good at it?\nLearning something new involves persistence. Of course you aren't great at it at the beginning.", "[deleted]", "Seriously.  \n\nI never read more than \"he's just brutally honest\" or \"I don't have a filter\" or \"that's just his sense of humor\" before I know, yep... YTA", "I second all of this. YTA.", "Yeah constructive feedback is the way to go here. \u201cNext time try adding more seasonings, and take it out of the oven sooner\u201d would be really useful for someone learning!", "His daddy does have a lot of money... so probably, yes.", "Even a rat. Did this kid never watch a Disney movie?", "Then she'll just make more of the same. (Not immediately, but in the future).", "You gotta read better, mom is not giving the silent treatment. She's just not effusing with conversation with OP.", "YTA in a massive way, respect your parents if they haven't given you reason not to, and you bro? Do you always have baseless ignorant opinions or just an off day?", "It\u2019s not about telling her he didn\u2019t like the cooking. If he had just said that, then that would be fine. He told her not to bother trying anymore, because there was no point. That\u2019s so unbelievably rude. It\u2019s not likely anything he\u2019s ever done has been perfect first time, and instead of encouraging his mother to keep trying until she gets it right, he discouraged her in the worst way. There was no need for how rude he was.", "\ud83c\udfc6 Take my free award \ud83e\udd2d", "OP, the asshole, did not thank her or show any appreciation though.", "You can tell someone their food isn't good without being a rude AH.", "Except it was bland which is fixable with some constructive feedback. \n\n\u201cWow, you put a lot of work to make this. Lasagna isn\u2019t easy. It was a good first effort but it was a little bland. Maybe needs a bit more herbs/spices to the sauce for next time. I\u2019m happy to taste test the sauce for you. \u201c\n\nInstead OP was rude and dismissive and owes his mom a massive apology", "I\u2019m dying at that visual!\n\n\u201cYou are such a bad walker, you didn\u2019t even take two steps! Just give up now, not everyone is cut out to walk. Maybe just find a new way of transportation.\u201d\n\nOP is definitely TA though", "Right? Imagine if his mom told him that using a toilet maybe just wasn\u2019t for him the first time he missed. Or using a spoon. Or speaking in full sentences. \n\nParenthood is basically coaching your child through all kinds of things humans aren\u2019t born knowing how to do, and suck at the first time they try. I guess this might be OP falling at the first hurdle of empathy but in any case he\u2019s totally TA", "Really? You needed strangers on the internet to explain this to you?", "I think that would be a good idea", "If I had a lot of money I don't think the implication would be I'd want to fund every aspect of my child's life well into adulthood so they never had to learn how to be an adult, but I'm going to guess that assumption is not going to pan out.", "Avoiding your child and not speaking to them is the silent treatment.
