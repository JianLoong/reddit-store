The best memories I have in life are with her and she\u2019s been my travel buddy ever since we were young. She grew up in a different lifestyle than me, as I had a single mom really doing everything she could to finish school and make sure I had a good life, and a financially unstable father growing up. She had everything provided for her, very financially supportive/inclined parents, even until she started working in the real world after college. I honestly see this as a blessing for her and it\u2019s a life I\u2019d want to provide for my kids, but I also want to be able to teach them to be humble and considerate of everyone. \n\nHere\u2019s the point: She\u2019s getting married and asked me to be her bridesmaid, which made me cry because I love her so much and am extatique to be by her side on her special day. The plans began for it to be early next year, local, and there would be around 200 people invited. We talked a couple weeks after and now she wants to elope, which I\u2019m super supportive of, as that\u2019s something I want to do as well. The thing is, where she wants to elope is suuuuuuper pricey to fly to (it\u2019s a domestic flight within the states) and she wants it to be THIS August. She has close family members that might not be able to go and is projecting the stress, as some of my side of the family have big things planned, too (school, month long trips, etc). She\u2019s getting frustrated because not everyone can be there and she seems to be expecting everyone to drop everything for her persistence. It is HER wedding and I emphasized to her she can do what she wants to do, but at least be considerate of peoples situations. I also told her to sit down and think if she wants her day with more people that love her, or if she just wants to say fuck it and who comes, comes. I also expressed that I don\u2019t expect her to understand, as she\u2019s had an overwhelming amount of support all her life. She hasn\u2019t responded to me and I\u2019m not sure I over stepped. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nEDIT: I know what elope means, I just said it like this because that\u2019s how she expressed the situation!

Are you just talking about a destination wedding?\n\nEither way you're not an asshole for pointing out that people can't necessarily show up for an expensive destination wedding on short notice, but if you're describing it as an elopement you're *also* kinda telling those guests not to come because it isn't really an event for guests!", "I feel like people have starting using elope to describe when they want to have a wedding but not be held responsible for any hosting responsibilities or expenses.  She is not using the word correctly - she wants a short notice destination wedding, not an elopement. But overall - your cousin can invite people but it is up to them whether they attend. I don\u2019t think it was wrong to point that out, but honestly, it\u2019s not your responsibility to make her see reason from now on since she seems unwilling to entertain any other points of view but her own. NTA", "How is she eloping and still having people attend? Isn't the point of eloping to not have people know?", "NTA at all. One of the most important things that real friends do for each other is provide reality checks. Yeah, we're there to support each other, but support, honest support, means real feedback when we're starting to stumble and acting like fools.  Believe me, I'd far rather a loving sit-down from a friend who cares about me than having people out in public telling me I'm a fool when I show my ass out there, which is what happens when the people who love you \\*don't\\* intervene.\n\nCouple things. What your cousin is talking about \\*isn't\\* eloping. Eloping is when the bride and groom and maybe a witness or two go off for a private wedding - it's done to cut costs, to cut drama, to get it \\*done\\*, for a lot of different reasons, but it's usually pretty simple, pretty quick, and not a big production. What your cousin is talking about is a destination wedding, and those usually come with the understanding (or they should) that not everyone is going to be able to make it. That's the price of having one of those - you get the fancy destination, but you lose some of the guests you might have wanted there. And you \\*don't\\* get to kvetch. \n\nAnd - no shade here, kiddo. It's ecstatic.  BTW - the way you talk about your mom is really sweet. I bet you'll be a great mom when you get there. It sounds like you're already a great friend.", "NTA. I don't see anything wrong with you telling her that some people may not be able to attend her wedding if she changes the date within 6 months of the wedding itself.", "English is not my first language but I though eloping meant getting married with like a couple of witnesses.\n\nWhat you're describing is a destination wedding to me.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s the thing about destination weddings, not everyone can go. If she wants them there THAT bad she should pay for them to go", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you cousin fully understands what \u201celoping\u201d is. Like that\u2019s something you do with a few people at most. It sounds like just wants a small destination wedding and is getting upset people aren\u2019t able to make it, which is understandable in that time frame.", "Is she eloping or is she having a destination wedding?\n\nEloping kinda comes with the assumption that very few people will attend (if any) from your friends and family and that you're kinda doing it in secret.", "Wait I'm confused I thought when you elope  it's secret no one is invited and you just come back like we're married now!", "NTA. You were completely honest with her. If she wants to have people travel, she also has to accept that not everyone will make it\u2014 for financial or scheduling reasons. I think it sounds like you\u2019re the voice of reason.", "NTA, though you should not have included the bit about how you \"don't expect her to understand\" because she's been spoiled.

That is a \"destination wedding\".\n\nElopement is a term that is often used in reference to a marriage which is conducted in a sudden and secretive fashion, sometimes involving a hurried flight away from one's place of residence together with one's beloved with the intention of getting married without parental approval.\n\n**e\u00b7lope** *(verb)*: run away secretly in order to get married, especially without parental consent.\n\nDestination weddings are ceremonies that are hosted away from the couple's hometown and usually require travel for the wedding party and guests.", "NTA you were realistic and not mean about it. August is 4 months away. No time to plan to even get there if it\u2019s a destination.", "NTA\n\nwhen people who haven't had to work for things their entire life suddenly have people saying no for various reasons, they usually can't understand it. \n\nbut why? nobody ever says no to me. I have money, why don't you? you're supposed to do what I want. \n\nyeah...like that. \n\nI wouldn't worry. being supportive sometimes means telling someone something they may not WANT to hear, but NEED to.", "NTA\n\nNo, you are not the asshole in this situation. You were being supportive of your cousin's wishes while trying to be considerate of everyone's situations. You expressed your opinion in a respectful way and offered her advice on how to make her decision. It is up to her to make the final decision but it doesn't seem like you overstepped any boundaries.", "Does elope mean something different nowadays? I thought it meant run off and get married in secret,  but so many posts talk about guests involved when eloping.", "YTA for making me think I was having a stroke with the misspelling of ecstatic LOL I was sat here for ages trying to figure out what it was", "What she wants to do is not eloping.  It is a destination wedding.  People who plan such weddings understand guests may not be able to afford the trip, hotel, meals out, days off work, etc.  people who plan destination weddings know the guests attending will be much smaller than having a wedding locally would allow. \n\nEloping is when a couple plan getting married with few or no guests is r reception or fuss.  You elope when you get married at a courthouse, for instance.  You avoid the planning, expense, guest lists, high cost of having a wedding with groomsmen and bridesmaids, etc.", "That\u2019s literally what I told her in the message! I\u2019m like you either want to say fuck it and go, whoever comes comes and who doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t, or you want people there. I told her she needed to sit down and really think because at that point you can\u2019t expect people to just go and it\u2019s a lot to ask for. It\u2019s one or the other", "Elope means just the two people getting married. She's confusing that with \"destination wedding\".", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying like ?? Lol. If we go to this place, there\u2019s be about 20/30 people she wants to come (immediate family)", "She said about 20/30 would come so it would be immediate family she wants there.

Not of my family members traveling for a month days after or the ones that have kids that have to pay $600, too. If I couldn\u2019t go, I feel like she\u2019ll hold it to me.", "But you do not *invite* people to an \"elopement\".", "Okay, then tell her that\u2019s a wedding. She can elope, or have a wedding. Maybe she doesn\u2019t understand the semantics.", "That's not an elopement, that's a small destination wedding. I know that the terminology isn't that important, but if she actually wants family there she's screwed up; she is using a term that pushes them *out* of the wedding when she wants to emphasize how much she really wants them to be there. That said, either way she cannot expect them to make it to an expensive destination wedding on short notice.", "I think we're are all getting caught up on the wrong aspect here. \n\nElope or don't elope or invite 19 people or 300 to your \"elopement\"...\n\nThe important part is the traveling. \n\nAnyone who has a destination wedding HAS to understand that some people won't be able to attend. \n\nTravel costs, time off work, asking for/using that time off work, travelling with kids, or finding babysitters....", "1.

Exstatiquelly.", "Not quite sure your cousin understands what elope means", "It sounds like you tried about the kindest way to deal with somebody who is becoming a bit bridezillaish about the idea that not everybody can or will take the time and money needed to attend her destination wedding.

How dare you! /s\n\nSeriously, NTA: you were very careful with her feelings as well as honest. You\u2019re a good friend for that, and if that\u2019s what you\u2019re teaching the kids, more power to you.\n\nI\u2019d be patient, however. Weddings are stressors, as sure as there are bridezillas out there. Not saying that your cuz is one, but she\u2019s probably very jumpy these days.", "Elope means you get married quietly with like 2 witnesses and tell people after. If she wants people to fly down, that is a destination wedding.", " NTA! I was always under the impression that couples who plan destination weddings do so with the knowledge that not everyone can come, and that it's kind of on purpose to keep the guest count low. Only in the last year or so have I heard stories about brides getting bent out of shape when their guests decline invites to such a pricey event. \n\nOP, weddings unfortunately have a way of bringing out the worst in people. You gave her very good advice, but she is not being rational.", "Just dug further and you're right, term has changed over the years. But still, she can't expect to have it both ways. Getting married in haste she can't expect people to just drop everything and hope they'll show up, it's still going to be a limited number.", "Eloping is a way to *avoid* people having to make travel plans..."]}
