They were together for 5 years and she\u2019s a lovely girl, we all got on really well and she\u2019s the nicest girl he\u2019s ever dated in 17 years. \n\nI have no idea what their relationship was like at home, I know they were going through a rough patch with a lot of life things not going right for them, but she adored him and he acted like he adored her. This has changed after the breakup, she\u2019s not said a bad word about him though he has plenty of bad things to say about her now. \n\nIt recently came out that he was having an affair for 6-12 months, I\u2019m not 100% sure, but it was atleast 6. His fianc\u00e9 called me to let me know they were breaking up and she was devastated, her cries were so heartbreaking they made me sick. \n\nShe moved out and went to stay with her brother.  Three weeks later our friend called my husband to let him know he was bringing his affair partner over to meet us, I said no. \n\nHe said they\u2019re in love, but I told him that there was no way that woman was welcome in my home, he can do whatever he wants, but I refuse to let him replace his fianc\u00e9 like that. If they are still seeing each other in 6 months I will allow it since shes clearly going to be involved in his life, but I won\u2019t be friends with her. \n\nMy husband said I\u2019m putting him in a hard place with his friend, but I don\u2019t care. He may have been our friend first, but she was in our lives for five years, she was our friend too. I can\u2019t in good conscience let this woman, who knew he was engaged, over to my home like nothing happened. I respect his ex-fianc\u00e9 to much to erase her like he has and accept the woman who knew he was getting married and she still had a relationship with him. \n\nI\u2019m not happy with my friend either, but after I tore shreds off him I have accepted my husband will always be best friends with him, I can barely look at him lately. \n\nI feel like I could be TA because a few of my friends have said I\u2019m being to harsh and that you can\u2019t help who you fall for, I\u2019ve also been told it\u2019s not my business. A few other friends are on my side and said people that allow this just condone cheating. \n\nI also think I could be TA because my friend says I should be supporting him and his happiness, he\u2019s upset with me, but I can\u2019t support this relationship, he said my opinion is too black and white and that IATA. \n\nHe\u2019s right, it is black and white. He cheated which is gut wrenching and I believe there\u2019s no excuse, he\u2019s devastated a girl and says he didn\u2019t mean to hurt her, I don\u2019t believe him. \n\nTL;DR- AITA for not allowing my friends affair partner to be involved in our lives for awhile after he cheated on his fianc\u00e9?", "created_utc": 1692270604, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tkc1w/aita_for_not_accepting_my_friends_new_girlfriend/", "score": 322, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Literally cheated on his fianc\u00e9 and has continued to bad mouth her afterwards. And your husband thinks that\u2019s perfectly fine. Probably not the worst idea to be wary of your husband. \n\nAnd I like your plan, if the affair partner last more than 6 months, then at least you know she\u2019ll be around for alittle bit. Not worth getting too attached to her since she\u2019ll be replaceable at any moment, no matter how serious their relationship is.", "NTA. But I wouldn't let him in your house either. He is the biggest culprit here.", "NTA but it says a lot about your husband that he'd stay best friends with such a blatant cheater who is also badmouthing his ex.", "NTA. He's an ass, your husband is being semi an ass as well.\n\nI'm a guy, I have a best friend, and his wife is my wife's best friend. I would 100% disown him if he cheated on his wife, as would my wife disown her friend if she cheated on him.\n\nThe actions and integrity of the people you choose to be around directly correlates to the actions and integrity you yourself would be ok operating at. Ask your husband his thoughts on infidelity within a marriage, REALLY ask him.\n\nEDIT: I alway write my response before reading others', I don't want to be swayed. But I see now others are also questioning your husband as well. Figure that shit out.", "NTA- repeat after me: yes, you can't control who you fall in love with but you can control whether you'll cheat on your partner or not. It's a cowardly thing to love someone else and not tell your partner to keep her from getting hurt even more. What was he hoping that would happen? Did he want to marry his fiance and just go on with his affair for the rest of his life?", "\u201cyou can\u2019t help who you fall for\u201d is totally right. but you absolutely shouldn\u2019t stay with someone if you know you want to be with someone else. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA but I would let that dinner hapen. It would be perfect oportunity to ask-\n1)How did you meet?\n2) Have long have you been sleeping together?\n3) How is feeling to be \"that woman\"?", "NTA, but I\u2019d focus on being angry at the friend who cheated on his wife rather than the affair partner", "NTA", "[removed]", "You know, women cheat too.", "It is not required to cut everyone out of your life who does something you don\u2019t condone, especially if the relationship is close and longstanding. OP is NTA at all, but this is not evidence that her husband is cheating on her or will in the future.", "\u201c7 tears\u201d to describe your first marriage is epic", "I think this is a 2 yes/1 no situation. She should not have to leave her own home for someone who doesn't live there. I would feel personally violated to have someone I felt that disgusted by violating my safe space/sanctuary. Husband can hang out with his friend outside the home.", "They prolly covered for eachother", "I'd be getting rid of the friend and the husband.", "IMO itd depend on what \"condoning\" looked like.\n\nDid OPs hubby help him cheat by fibbing to the ex-fiance about guys nights? Is OPs hubby also badmouthing the ex? Is he **supportive** of the cheating? Or is he doing anything to hold his friend accountable and call him on his bad behavior?\n\nTbh, if I were OP Id be clear that the cheating friend wasnt welcome in my home for a while. If they want to get together they can go out for dinner or meet at the friend's place. But Id be distancing for a bit, and wouldnt want them in my space for a while. If hes comfy enough to badmouth the ex he wronged, Id be pretty done with him.\n\nAfter that it would depend on hiw things shook out.", "That's not how that works in most relationships though. Both have rights here.  Thr easy compromises involve someone leaving for a short time, or if the home is very large secluding themselves to a room and waiting it out.  Your \"disgust\" doesn't trump your husband's wishes, and vise versa.  It's also frankly a silly immature way to be towards a person you don't know or don't approve of your friends actions.\n\nYou can ask your hubby to meet up outside the home but you don't have a right to force him.", "Yuuup. Id be done with that dude - and anyone defending him - too.\n\nI once told my partner's brother's fiance that he was cheating on her. At Christmas dinner. It was the second time we'd met and my partner and I are not super close to his family.\n\nBut the brother in question had been **boasting** about cheating at Thanksgiving dinner, then they show up for Christmas recently engaged?!\n\nI waited until they were about to leave, pretended I needed a \"feminine product\" to get a private second, told her and how I knew, apologized, and then left the ball in her court.\n\nThey did get married, so maybe she'd known already. But Im not going to be involved in covering up for shitty people. Period.\n\nMy partner thought I should have kept it to myself since I didnt really know her, but he also knew no one else was going to tell her. So he wasn't mad or anything, and he did think she deserved to know. He'd pushed his brother on being a dick at thanksgiving.", "That's ridiculous. If you think that OP can \"ask hubby to meet up outside the home but doesn't have the right to force him\", then equally hubby can ask to bring an unwanted guest into the home but doesn't have the right to force her.\n\nIt's both their home. He wants this woman to come in. She wants this woman to stay out. Asking OP to leave the house while this woman comes in is not a compromise, it's hubby getting what he wants and OP having to leave her own house if she won't go along with it.", "Give me the example where both hubby and user above get what they want.   Provide two examples both parties can be equally happy with, if you can.  Although good example will suffice.\n\nMy philosophy for relationships is compromises where both parties get what they ultimately want, or both parties get part of what they want.  Both parties should not get anything out of the conflict.", "Found the friend who cheated \ud83e\udd23", "They talk and try to find a compromise, if there is one to be found. Not hubby gets everything he wants and OP gets nothing. FFS.", "Ok give an example using OP as reference point. Actor X wants B to come to home. Actor Y says no.  What's the resolution look like?", "Still not the same", "I don't need to provide a perfect solution. OP is justified in not wanting someone in her home. \"Go in the other room or leave\" is not a reasonable solution. That's it.", "Fair enough. I guess you aren't much for logic.", "Bullshit. Don't tell me that my solution sucks if you won't provide a better alternative. OP and you are both assholes on this issue.  I provided 4 different solutions all of which are reasonable compromises that adults make in relationships with other people with different thoughts and feelings."]}
