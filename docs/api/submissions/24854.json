They were together for 5 years and she\u2019s a lovely girl, we all got on really well and she\u2019s the nicest girl he\u2019s ever dated in 17 years. \n\nI have no idea what their relationship was like at home, I know they were going through a rough patch with a lot of life things not going right for them, but she adored him and he acted like he adored her. This has changed after the breakup, she\u2019s not said a bad word about him though he has plenty of bad things to say about her now. \n\nIt recently came out that he was having an affair for 6-12 months, I\u2019m not 100% sure, but it was atleast 6. His fianc\u00e9 called me to let me know they were breaking up and she was devastated, her cries were so heartbreaking they made me sick. \n\nShe moved out and went to stay with her brother.  Three weeks later our friend called my husband to let him know he was bringing his affair partner over to meet us, I said no. \n\nHe said they\u2019re in love, but I told him that there was no way that woman was welcome in my home, he can do whatever he wants, but I refuse to let him replace his fianc\u00e9 like that. If they are still seeing each other in 6 months I will allow it since shes clearly going to be involved in his life, but I won\u2019t be friends with her. \n\nMy husband said I\u2019m putting him in a hard place with his friend, but I don\u2019t care. He may have been our friend first, but she was in our lives for five years, she was our friend too. I can\u2019t in good conscience let this woman, who knew he was engaged, over to my home like nothing happened. I respect his ex-fianc\u00e9 to much to erase her like he has and accept the woman who knew he was getting married and she still had a relationship with him. \n\nI\u2019m not happy with my friend either, but after I tore shreds off him I have accepted my husband will always be best friends with him, I can barely look at him lately. \n\nI feel like I could be TA because a few of my friends have said I\u2019m being to harsh and that you can\u2019t help who you fall for, I\u2019ve also been told it\u2019s not my business. A few other friends are on my side and said people that allow this just condone cheating. \n\nI also think I could be TA because my friend says I should be supporting him and his happiness, he\u2019s upset with me, but I can\u2019t support this relationship, he said my opinion is too black and white and that IATA. \n\nHe\u2019s right, it is black and white. He cheated which is gut wrenching and I believe there\u2019s no excuse, he\u2019s devastated a girl and says he didn\u2019t mean to hurt her, I don\u2019t believe him. \n\nTL;DR- AITA for not allowing my friends affair partner to be involved in our lives for awhile after he cheated on his fianc\u00e9?", "created_utc": 1692270604, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tkc1w/aita_for_not_accepting_my_friends_new_girlfriend/", "score": 204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
