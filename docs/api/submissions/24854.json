{"id": 24854, "submission_id": "15tkc1w", "title": "AITA for not accepting my friends new girlfriend ?", "selftext": "My (43f)  husbands best friend(42m), who is also my friend of 17 years, recently cheated on his fianc\u00e9. They were together for 5 years and she\u2019s a lovely girl, we all got on really well and she\u2019s the nicest girl he\u2019s ever dated in 17 years. \n\nI have no idea what their relationship was like at home, I know they were going through a rough patch with a lot of life things not going right for them, but she adored him and he acted like he adored her. This has changed after the breakup, she\u2019s not said a bad word about him though he has plenty of bad things to say about her now. \n\nIt recently came out that he was having an affair for 6-12 months, I\u2019m not 100% sure, but it was atleast 6. His fianc\u00e9 called me to let me know they were breaking up and she was devastated, her cries were so heartbreaking they made me sick. \n\nShe moved out and went to stay with her brother.  Three weeks later our friend called my husband to let him know he was bringing his affair partner over to meet us, I said no. \n\nHe said they\u2019re in love, but I told him that there was no way that woman was welcome in my home, he can do whatever he wants, but I refuse to let him replace his fianc\u00e9 like that. If they are still seeing each other in 6 months I will allow it since shes clearly going to be involved in his life, but I won\u2019t be friends with her. \n\nMy husband said I\u2019m putting him in a hard place with his friend, but I don\u2019t care. He may have been our friend first, but she was in our lives for five years, she was our friend too. I can\u2019t in good conscience let this woman, who knew he was engaged, over to my home like nothing happened. I respect his ex-fianc\u00e9 to much to erase her like he has and accept the woman who knew he was getting married and she still had a relationship with him. \n\nI\u2019m not happy with my friend either, but after I tore shreds off him I have accepted my husband will always be best friends with him, I can barely look at him lately. \n\nI feel like I could be TA because a few of my friends have said I\u2019m being to harsh and that you can\u2019t help who you fall for, I\u2019ve also been told it\u2019s not my business. A few other friends are on my side and said people that allow this just condone cheating. \n\nI also think I could be TA because my friend says I should be supporting him and his happiness, he\u2019s upset with me, but I can\u2019t support this relationship, he said my opinion is too black and white and that IATA. \n\nHe\u2019s right, it is black and white. He cheated which is gut wrenching and I believe there\u2019s no excuse, he\u2019s devastated a girl and says he didn\u2019t mean to hurt her, I don\u2019t believe him. \n\nTL;DR- AITA for not allowing my friends affair partner to be involved in our lives for awhile after he cheated on his fianc\u00e9?", "created_utc": 1692270604, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tkc1w/aita_for_not_accepting_my_friends_new_girlfriend/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then he had the nerve to badmouth her? And your husband is just okay with this weeks later? Worrisome that your husband doesn't feel the need for a break, too. Stand your ground, he's lucky you plan to speak with him ever again.", "NTA. You can, and should, 100% control who you \"fall in love\" with when you're in a relationship. He shouldn't have been entertaining anything like that while engaged to another woman. Neither of them are the kind of people I would want to be friends with or be involved in my marriage.", "NTA. I don't respect cheaters and I'd be worried about my husband is so easy to morally accept and welcome cheater - beware.", "I\u2019d have a lot more questions for the husband. I\u2019m sorry, but he obviously knew and he\u2019s been lying for months too. \n  \n  I wouldn\u2019t have her in the house either, NTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd you can tell your friends that if they fell in love with another person while they were otherwise engaged, the decent thing to do is leave the current partner, and not cheat on them for literal months and then badmouth her with everyone.", "NTA. I would think that your husband would appreciate you having a harsh stance on cheaters. You sound like \"good people\" to me.\n\nA cooling off period before meeting the affair partner sounds smart.", "\" I\u2019ve also been told it\u2019s not my business \" - it's your house, isn't it?\n\nYou need to support the ex by inviting her to dinner, showing her that her friends are not abandoning her or spreading lies like BFF. That's a conversation to have with your husband too - what is HE doing to support a friend who his bro betrayed?\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Presumably your husband also genuinely liked the former fianc\u00e9e?  Then he should appreciate she is a real person in your life, not interchangeable at a whim.  \nI think your suggestion that if they are still a thing in six months time you might be warmer to the idea of meeting another woman, even one who caused your friend such grief. Though to be clear, it is your husband\u2019s friend who is at fault here, he was betrothed and he betrayed a good woman. \nBut don\u2019t be bulldozed into it. Your have your reasons, your moral compass, it can\u2019t be discounted to make others feel better about their shitty behaviour.  \nYou and your husband need to be clear that any meetings, dinners, will not be happening in your home. It is a big world, plenty of other places to eat.", "NTA. It's ok to say it's just too soon", "NTA - I agree with the notion that accepting the other woman is condoning his actions of cheating, which is never acceptable. If he was not happy, he could have ended things rather than cheating for such a long period of time. Huge respect to you.", "NTA.
