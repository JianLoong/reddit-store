They're acting on some fantasy in their heads by making it a \"family\" vacation, but then not treating you right when they get there. I doubt this is the only problem with them. Consider that they may be less than honest or helpful in other ways - don't take their word as gospel truth.

It sounds like you can\u2019t win: you go on vacation and get yelled at, or you stay behind and get yelled at as well. You might as well stay at home and enjoy a couple weeks of peace and quiet.
