And she\u2019s your older sister lol. She has no shame!", "Maybe your mom didn't know the whole story. In any case I think you have done enough for your sister she seems a little spolied and if you continue to help her she will never learn the real value of things, so if you want to help her you need to stop giving her so much and just wait until she earns her money. I support your decision of selling your phone to your Bf it seems like he appreciates more, good luck and be strong.

If people can't afford something, they work harder and save up.\n\nYour sister's current phone is clearly good enough, your BF's one was not. He could have had a new battery fitted and bought a portable charger. Or he could have gotten something himself through a contract, as could your sister. Your sister allegedly agreed to you selling the phone to your bf, but you (from some reason) decided to give your sister some compensation money (wtf?).\n\nYou are keeping them all dependent on you. Sounds like you like the power and to lord it over them. And the others don't understand the joy of autonomy. And your mum sticks her nose in where she shouldn't and will ruin your relationships forever.", "NTA.  Your sister is very entitled and slightly bonkers.  Your mother is also a bit bonkers.  Its your stuff, you get to choose what you do with it, and its not like your sister hasn't had plenty of stuff from you.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that she received an almost new phone every single year makes it even worse.\n\nI personally think OP is strange for buying a new iPhone every year because that just seems wasteful, but if they can afford to do so, then that is their choice.\n\nBut the sister complaining because one year she doesn't get a new free phone is utterly ridiculous. Completely spoilt and unappreciative", "Exactly, As clearly stated OP has always given her old phones to her sister. Not out of any debt or issue but of her own choice.She then added money so her sister can get a better phone. What gives her the right to complain about it when OP even got her a better phone. OP please can ignore her and stop giving her things if she's gonna act so entitled.\nYour mom should stop taking sides and stop trying to guilt-trip you. NTA"]}
