Even my own mother said she can\u2019t make it because she will be at step sisters wedding and getting ready all day. I\u2019m pissed how can she choose a step daughter over her own grandchild. Everyone is picking this girl who isn\u2019t even really family over my daughter. My mom says to just change the party but I think it\u2019s ridiculous they can\u2019t do both and won\u2019t change my schedule for my step sister.

A wedding can't be moved.\n\nI'm a stepdaughter - being welcomed by a step-parent is a blessing, and your bitterness is nothing other than childish.\n\nChange the date of your daughter's birthday party so everyone can enjoy both days and stop inflicting your petty issues onto the rest of your family.", "INFO: did your mom actually mistreat or neglect you when she got remarried? From what you wrote it sounds like just the fact of having a step sister is what set you off. I may edit later be in the meantime:\n\nYTA. Aside from all the stuff about how you never worked through your feelings of jealousy etc when your mom remarried and how you deliberately scheduled a conflicting event because you thought everyone would prioritize your kid's bday since you think blood family is more important or whatever phrase you used [\ud83e\udd2e], attending weddings is exhausting and the last thing I'd wanna do before going to one is drag my ass to a 1 y.o.'s bday party that was scheduled out of immature spite.", "YTA", "YTA - do you remember your own wedding? You weren't the only person running around, stressed out, trying to make sure that everything was perfect. Depending on the size of your wedding, most likely everyone had a job and very few actually just showed up and did nothing besides relax and have a good time. \n\nPlus, your child is only 1 year old. That baby isn't going to remember anything about their birthday this year (or probably next) and the only thing that'll happen is: people come over, chat, eat some food, baby appears from it's nap, people go awwe look at their little outfit, you sit the baby down in front of their cake, you blow out the candles, then you pretend that the baby is opening its gifts, then people start to get bored and leave. At some point the baby cries because someone it doesn't know picks it up or tries to hold it. \n\nImo, wedding sounds WAY more fun. And is something more memorable. You can't be upset at people for choosing fun over forced awkwardness of a baby's 1st birthday party. Especially when you refuse to give them the proper opportunity to attend. Weddings, as you well know, are planned months if not years in advance. Wedding dates are usually the first thing selected. So, depending on when your stepsister got engaged, your date was already irrelevant to your guests. \n\nAnd, sorry not sorry, I'm not going to spend all day getting dressed and ready for a wedding, to go to a baby's 1st birthday and risk getting thrown up on.

Since it isn't your daughter's actual birthday it isn't as though your step-sister scheduled over her day. Move it to the next weekend! Also, any concern for your daughter's feelings about this are kind of ridiculous. She's turning one, she has no concept of dates or birthdays yet and will be fine with whatever date the party happens on. To be truthful, like most one year olds she will probably be put off by the whole thing! \n\nIt seems like your true issue here is the feeling of your mom replacing you or putting your stepsister first. That's a legitimate feeling and I'm sure it has caused you a great deal of pain throughout your life. From what you've said it seems like the reason you don't have a relationship with your stepsister in the first place. But that isn't your stepsister's fault. \n\nThe mature thing to do here is to reschedule your daughter's party, and to find another time to talk with your mother one-on-one about the feelings that spurred this conflict.

Even my own mother said she can\u2019t make it because she will be at step sisters wedding and getting ready all day. I\u2019m pissed how can she choose a step daughter over her own grandchild. Everyone is picking this girl who isn\u2019t even really family over my daughter. My mom says to just change the party but I think it\u2019s ridiculous they can\u2019t do both and won\u2019t change my schedule for my step sister.

Stepsiblings are not unusual.", "Lol they wont care about a birthday the Child wont even remember\n\n\nYta", "But they won\u2019t do that, and it\u2019ll be entirely your fault.\n\nYou clearly tried to make it a competition to see which daughter your mother chooses. Spoiler - she\u2019s not going to choose you. Fuck around and find out.\n\nYTA.", "So you want people to be extra busy on a day they already have plans for, and your mad at them? You need therapy, for your daughter's sake.", "Do you not know how stressful the wedding day is? There is TONNES to do! But regardless, if you want people to come, you know what to do. No-one's going to give you the time of day to listen to this non-point you're trying to make", "I think the issue is YOU need to \"come to the party\". Listen, you don't see them as family, but everyone else does. That's a you issue that you're clearly willing to die on and cause issues about. You're clearly not over any of the emotions, you haven't worked through them, you've done nothing besides carry your baggage into your newborns life. \n\nYou need some therapy asap.\n\nYTA.", "This is one of the most inconsiderate solutions I\u2019ve ever come across.\n\nAre people supposed to come to a child\u2019s birthday party in their wedding finery?\n\nYou expect them to rush around getting to your place and then get themselves back home or to a hotel to rush around getting ready for a wedding? Do you have any idea how exhausting that sounds?\n\nAnd then what happens if they do come to your party? Are you going to get pissed if they leave early because they have somewhere else to be?\n\nYou are deliberately creating a situation so the family has to choose between you and your stepsister. If it\u2019s a choice between a 1 year old birthday party and a wedding you are going to lose.\n\nBut you know that. I think you\u2019re looking for something to hold over your mother\u2019s head.\n\nYou\u2019re creating this. You can\u2019t blame anyone else when it backfires.", "I am guessing that her dad encouraged this way of thinking. The total lack of empathy for a girl whose mom died is upsetting, especially considering she is a mom herself now.", "It\u2019s because this is pretty obviously a child writing this. No adult woman would act like this.", "The disgusting part is she probably believes that she is her daughters only mother, and no one else can ever be her mom. She won't even consider the treatment, she would probably like to come back and haunt whichever poor soul dares to attempt to be a mother to her child. So I don't think she has the ability to truly consider your hypothetical.", "I dunno, if OP keeps effectively demanding Mom make a choice, she might get her wish.  I just don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to like what Mom chooses.", "I found out a few weeks ago but didn\u2019t think it would matter they can just do both. I would think blood family is more important", "Ha!! What an amazing point\n\nShe claims to care about her daughter and blood family etc etc - but she\u2019s literally spiting her own daughter to hold a grudge against her step sis!", "the kid won't suffer! Won't even remember it...\n\nDo you know someone who has memories of their first birthday party?", "Right. They are THRILLED she planned it on the same day so they don\u2019t have to go", "Raise your hand if you love this comment!!!!  ME:  raising hand.", "No adult woman would act like this? May I please turn your attention to the JustNo subs?", "She certainly won't, and I want to be happy about it but unfortunately the only person OP will blame is her innocent step sister. She will never take into account that  she's her own worst enemy. It's honestly just so pathetic and childish, to have this outlook on life, and I truly believe she scheduled this party on the same day in the hopes of sabotaging the wedding. It didn't work, so now she's here to seek validation and garner sympathy. We have none to give her, but if she wants to send her step sister my way, I'll give her allllll of mine instead.", "Blood family is more important? That's one of the most disgusting things I've ever read on here. Family is family.", "With your attitude, it\u2019s no wonder they aren\u2019t doing both.", "YTA.  To even think that way, SMH.", "Blood family is more important??? Your husband must love the fact that he comes after your entire family than\u2026 seriously please never foster/adopt children or remarry cause you would suck in the role of a adoptive parent or stepmom\u2026", "Very few people would want to go to a birthday party the day they have a wedding to go to. You gambled and lost, too bad your dragging your child into it as well.", "I mean, clearly people aren\u2019t going to do both. They are explicitly telling you that they will do the wedding over the birthday. \n\nSo you\u2019d rather have no one there for your child\u2019s first birthday? All because of a petty squabble with your stepsister?", "Not when they suck as much as you do.", "As a popular TV show has always rightfully stated: family don't end with blood, and it doesn't start there either.\n\nAs much as I love my parents, I live thousands of miles from them. Yes, they are family but the friends I've made where I live are family to me and if I'd agreed to do something with them first, it would be that before my blood family's thing.\n\nYou sound toxic AF. In fact, it's usually toxic people who say \"blood family matters more than anything else.\" So I'm going to take a guess that regardless of the YTA votes here (my vote too), you're going to ignore it and play the victim."]}
