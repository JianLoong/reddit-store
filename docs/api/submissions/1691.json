Even my own mother said she can\u2019t make it because she will be at step sisters wedding and getting ready all day. I\u2019m pissed how can she choose a step daughter over her own grandchild. Everyone is picking this girl who isn\u2019t even really family over my daughter. My mom says to just change the party but I think it\u2019s ridiculous they can\u2019t do both and won\u2019t change my schedule for my step sister.

A wedding can't be moved.\n\nI'm a stepdaughter - being welcomed by a step-parent is a blessing, and your bitterness is nothing other than childish.\n\nChange the date of your daughter's birthday party so everyone can enjoy both days and stop inflicting your petty issues onto the rest of your family.", "INFO: did your mom actually mistreat or neglect you when she got remarried? From what you wrote it sounds like just the fact of having a step sister is what set you off. I may edit later be in the meantime:\n\nYTA. Aside from all the stuff about how you never worked through your feelings of jealousy etc when your mom remarried and how you deliberately scheduled a conflicting event because you thought everyone would prioritize your kid's bday since you think blood family is more important or whatever phrase you used [\ud83e\udd2e], attending weddings is exhausting and the last thing I'd wanna do before going to one is drag my ass to a 1 y.o.'s bday party that was scheduled out of immature spite.", "YTA", "YTA - do you remember your own wedding? You weren't the only person running around, stressed out, trying to make sure that everything was perfect. Depending on the size of your wedding, most likely everyone had a job and very few actually just showed up and did nothing besides relax and have a good time. \n\nPlus, your child is only 1 year old. That baby isn't going to remember anything about their birthday this year (or probably next) and the only thing that'll happen is: people come over, chat, eat some food, baby appears from it's nap, people go awwe look at their little outfit, you sit the baby down in front of their cake, you blow out the candles, then you pretend that the baby is opening its gifts, then people start to get bored and leave. At some point the baby cries because someone it doesn't know picks it up or tries to hold it. \n\nImo, wedding sounds WAY more fun. And is something more memorable. You can't be upset at people for choosing fun over forced awkwardness of a baby's 1st birthday party. Especially when you refuse to give them the proper opportunity to attend. Weddings, as you well know, are planned months if not years in advance. Wedding dates are usually the first thing selected. So, depending on when your stepsister got engaged, your date was already irrelevant to your guests. \n\nAnd, sorry not sorry, I'm not going to spend all day getting dressed and ready for a wedding, to go to a baby's 1st birthday and risk getting thrown up on.

She's turning one, she has no concept of dates or birthdays yet and will be fine with whatever date the party happens on.

Even my own mother said she can\u2019t make it because she will be at step sisters wedding and getting ready all day. I\u2019m pissed how can she choose a step daughter over her own grandchild. Everyone is picking this girl who isn\u2019t even really family over my daughter.

Her actual birthday is in the middle of the week.", "This was one of the saddest parts of it all for me. I have barely enough patience for adults having such drama - but to put a child who has nothing to do with anything in the middle. You used the exact word: pawn", "Surprised it took me scrolling this far to get to\nthis. OP seems like a champion at weaponizing/emotional manipulation so she will absolutely use this to fuel not only her own ongoing vendetta, but to mold her daughter into another ally and weapon to use.", "Reminds me of- \"resentment is like peeing your pants. Everyone can see it, but only YOU can feel it.\"", "I\u2019ve got the pics and they felt the love.", "That's exactly why she picked that day. She wanted to force her mom to choose betwen her \"rEaL daughter\" and step daughter. Utterly unfathomable and disgusting.", "Cruel to mom, step sis - and weaponzing her child. Honestly not sure which part of this is worse", "Or her daughter is a spoiled brat. I mean, we can\u2019t discount that possibility.", "No necessarily. A lot of parents introduce their blended families and try to foster a sense of unity, but are met with resistance because most people don\u2019t like or deal with change well.

Probably she was old enough to give shits and be a menace and to be fully aware about everything she is doing. It is just my opinion.", "While I could sort of agree to that - ultimately, OP is still not punishing the step sister in all this. And to add insult to injury, she\u2019s weaponizing her own daughter to \u201cstick it to the sister\u201d\n\nWhy pick a wedding and first birthday to make this point? And why not take it up with MOM??", "There is a picture of each of my kids with their first birthday cake - my daughter looks downright confused and my son is actively angry.

I can understand her resentment, and this resentment probably built up from when she is a child and affects her as an adult.\n\nOP needs therapy\u2026 she sounds super insecure about her mom and her side of family. I also think mom probably should have managed her relationship with OP better when introducing stepfamily.

He would call her out of her name constantly, and he would demean her success (she became a nurse).  Even when she would help take care of him when his prostate cancer became terminal, nothing she did was good enough.  Before he died, I asked him why did he hate her so and he told me that he was the only child for 6 years and it should have stayed that way.  I mentioned that she wasn't treated any better than he, in fact, she had it harder because my Aunt (their Mom) raised her  that women are to be the homemakers and he got away with a lot of crap way more than his sister ever did.

My parents still gave all of us (4 kids in total) the same attention they did before my little brother was born, but a baby needs more attention than an 8-year-old and my sister seemed to take that personally. She was a pretty well-behaved kid and suddenly she was getting in trouble at school, getting in trouble at home, getting in trouble at friend's houses. We're grown now and she has a much better relationship with our little brother, but boy did she go through it when he was born.", "Also, if Mom *always* took stepsister's side even when she was wrong then OP wouldn't be shocked that she is picking the wedding over the birthday party. OP forced people to choose sides because she thought she might win, that implies that stepsister hasn't been blindly favoured in the past.", "Yeah, I don't get this at all, but I've seen it, too. Sometimes people get really sour about stuff and it isn't because of how their parents treated them.

I can absolutely see a mother just trying to shine on for years, waiting for her daughter to grow up and see things another way, and then having to deal with the fact that it just never happened.", "Entirely possible, but just like OP doesn't say anything to suggest her mom did something awful, she doesn't say her dad did, either. Though it's very possible that if he has just supported her feelings of jealousy the whole time she wouldn't see what he was doing as toxic.", ">My little sister was the baby of the family for 8 years before my little brother came along and she FLIPPED at not being the baby anymore. \n\nHa! I was just talking to my nephew about this -- he handled not being the baby anymore well, but we were talking about how he was the baby of the family for 7 years and then BOOM: Middle Child. \n\nI will give him this -- it's an adjustment. He's a good brother to her, but she totally took his spot.", "I'd say YTA. Regardless of whether you chose to have a relationship with your stepsister, I think it'd be a given, via your mom, that you'd know when the wedding is prior to setting the date for the birthday party. You'd have known about the engagement, you'd have known about the dates, etc since you still keep in touch with your mom, and there's no way she wouldn't have brought any of those up in conversation. \nI also think you're purposely trying to sabotage the wedding and sway guests away from it. I feel sorry for your daughter for having such a petty mom.", "You are creating unnecessary conflict and I\u2019d imagine making everyone in your family feel uncomfortable due to your deep-seated insecurities and rivalry with your sister, a rivalry in which you\u2019re the only participant. I get that when we a person gets caught up in a rivalry, or other emotionally charged situation, regardless of its merits, we can easily lose sight of what is important, or the hurt our own selfish actions are causing others, and obviously, in this situation, you are TA. However, I applaud you for being forthright in your post, as I\u2019m sure on some level you already knew what the responses would be, and that is never easy to hear. \nI only hope that you are able to take some perspective from this, and allow this experience to help reassess your feelings and your actions. And I hope that leads to positive changes felt by all of those in your life, from your mom, to your child, even to your sister, but mostly it will be you that benefits. Because it really cannot have been easy carrying so much hatred and jealousy for all these years, and it reveals deeply rooted insecurity, relationship and acceptance issues, that I know from my experience, can make life feel like hell when everything is filtered through these issues. I can tell you this wasn\u2019t about your mom choosing your sister over you, you set up a conflict due to issues with insecurity. Your mother made the right decision and sounds like a kind, caring person. Blood does not make one child more family than another, I\u2019m glad your sister was fortunate enough to become part of a family where she was able to receive a mother\u2019s love without being made to feel lesser than any other child in your mother\u2019s heart. Hopefully in time you can come to see that you weren\u2019t losing a part of your mother to your new sibling, but rather were gaining a sister and all the awesomeness that could have entailed had you allowed yourself to be open to her. I\u2019m sure she probably wished that had been the case as well. While you can\u2019t change what has happened, by facing why you behaved that way and working to improve yourself, one day you may be able to accept responsibility, apologize and begin to make amends with your sister, and family at large. Not only will that likely lead to more happiness in your life, but can lead to a better environment and future for your child. I can only hope that this post serves as a wake up call and spurs you to begin addressing them. \nEven if just for the sake of your child, I would strongly encourage to see a licensed professional to begin unpacking and working through the issues listed in OP, and any others you may be dealing with. There is no shame in seeking out the help of a therapist, myself, and I\u2019m sure a good majority of those responding either are currently seeing someone, or have at various points in their life. I can tell you from experience that it may feel difficult at first, you may even stop and restart several times and that\u2019s perfectly ok. The benefits in the long run are definitely worth sticking with it. \nAnd your child is definitely worth that effort!", "YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t seriously not see that, right? You hate this girl for no reason other than you didn\u2019t want a sibling. Your mother did the right thing, that ALL stepparents should do, and treated her stepkid the same as her biological kid. You are no more important than she is, just because you have a blood relation, just as she is no more important than you are. \n\nI would put money on betting that you purposely scheduled your child\u2019s birthday party on the same date as your stepsisters wedding out of spite. Even if that\u2019s not the case, a wedding trumps a birthday party, especially for a one year old. A wedding is a lot more expensive to reschedule and there is no good reason for it to be rescheduled, whereas you could easily change the date of the birthday party. You\u2019re claiming that your stepsister is ruining your one year olds birthday party, even though presumably this wedding has been planned and scheduled for this date before your child was even born. Also, a one year old is not going to remember their birthday party. They will not care if it\u2019s the weekend after their birthday vs the weekend before. \n\nInfo: how old were you and your stepsister when your parents got married?", "YTA. A wedding trumps a first birthday party. Just the sheer amount of time required to get ready for a wedding means that no, actually, people couldn\u2019t do both - and who would WANT to do two social events in a day like that? Weddings are expensive to organise, and you (in theory) have ONE in your lifetime. Your kid will have tons more birthdays and won\u2019t even remember her first. You\u2019re definitely the asshole here.", "Completely YTA looking at all of that.\n\nFrankly it was the same judgement before I learned this - it takes the merest pinch of common sense to realise that 7 hours between the *start of 2 events* is not enough time for many people to easily attend both on time, and that's for any event.  Add in the fact that the second one is a wedding, which is likely to mean needing to change into formal wedding attire, and of course no one wants to completely stress themselves out over trying to fit in what, realistically, would be about 30 minutes of cooing over the baby, baby getting overwhelmed and crying, a cup of coffee and quiet chat while said baby inevitably falls asleep and a 50/50 chance of getting spit-up in your hair.\n\nThis is the most pointlessly petty nonsense I have seen on here.  The 1 year old isn't even going to remember it.  OP is tanking her relationship with her entire family for literally no reason over another woman who lost her own mother in childbirth.", "This. Exactly.\n\nu/sistersmash (also what a horribly telling username) Your family has chosen to make your sister part of their family, and seem to like to enjoy spending time with her. If you\u2019re this unpleasant all the time, they\u2019re eventually not even going to spend time with you out of obligation. Consider that.\n\nI hope you realize that family doesn\u2019t owe you their unconditional love. If you insist on making it conditional, you\u2019re gonna get a rough awakening one day and your own kid is gonna suffer for your immaturity, selfishness, and ineptitude.", "Came here to say this. At 1 year old, that baby couldn't give a toot about a birthday party. This woman's child isn't suffering. She's using her kid as a martyr to try and get sympathy and it's pretty gross.", "This made me think of the episode of This Is Us where the mom and her three children are in a therapy session and the oldest is accusing her of loving her other 2 children more than him (specially the adopted child) and she says is not true. But upon him pressuring her to say is true she says, \u201cThey were just easier!\u201d I\u2019ve never thought of this before and it might be true that OP with all her resentment made it harder for her mom to continue to show her affection and it might have come easier to show affection to her living in step-daughter.", "Weddings are always a bigger deal than a first birthday. \n\nUnless the parents of the kid are offering an all-expenses-paid luxury trip to someplace exotic for several days... In that case I'd be reconsidering the importance of my relationship to the wedding couple.", "Good point. I\u2019ve never heard of a wedding where the ceremony starts that late.

Def hope this is one she sees!!!", "It'll also be the best!", "I absolutely agree... I have a feeling she's been fighting this tooth & nail from the time her mom married her step dad, & I'm sure made everyone's lives that much more complicated, which makes it that much more difficult to maintain a pleasant relationship with her.", "And if OPs kid grows up being weaponized, she might turn out to like OPs family more than OP.

She spent all that money but didn't even enjoy the night since things weren't going as she planned and she had to look after the baby and also had to serve and socialize with the guests.

The baby looked like he was having none of it and he won't even remember anything growing up\" But hey, at least I got free food. \n\nOh, and when the party was over, there weren't any food left but she didn't even have the chance to take a bite.

But I've asked my parents about it,  & they confirmed that yes,  those things actually happened,  & told me the whole story. \n\nThe most vivid one was of being somewhere remote with animals,  & fields,  it was just my dad,  & grandpa. I remember being outside,  petting some cows,  & goats, my grandpa showing me the seeds inside a cotton boll. My dad taking me to use the facilities,  but said facilities were a pretty scary outhouse, & my freaking out over not wanting bugs to jump out of the literal hole in the ground to bite my ass while I peed. I thought it must be a dream I was remembering. \n\nI told my parents about it,  & they both laughed,  & told me that did actually happen.  We were city people,  but a relative of dad's had just bought some farm land out in the sticks, so dad & grandpa went with him to look at it,  & brought me with.  Mom & little brother stayed home,  coz brother wasn't old enough to walk yet,  & the terrain was too rough for a stroller. \n\nThey did the math,  & even went through my brother's baby book to see when he started walking. My grandpa was still alive,  & hadn't yet been diagnosed with prostate cancer.  They couldn't pinpoint the exact date,  but all of that indicated I was younger than 3.5yo, but older than 3, which would explain the fuzziness of the memory. Dad also told me more about that trip,  how I was obsessed with the chickens, but got scared when I watched a huge spider come out of a hole in the ground,  & snatch a smaller chick, how I ate my weight in mangos, & rose apple fruit. The whole potty ordeal,  which started with me refusing to pee in the bushes, but ended with my freaking out when dad took me to the outhouse, & it was just a wooden structure with a hole in the ground, & that it wasn't bugs in general that I was scared of,  it was those giant spiders! This hole was much bigger,  & my 3yo self decided that meant the spider living in it must be massive, & would absolutely do me in like the poor chick.  \ud83e\udd23", "Yea, but if she did that, you know OP would have mentioned it.

No one stealing anyone's parents, simply a younger sibling they just never got over. Some people are just troubled", "Per OP, it\u2019s now \u201cher party\u201d lol she is barely even pretending this is about her kids bday anymore", "Is better is they fall asleep before the presents. It\u2019s painful trying to watch a one year old open multiple presents. They just keep getting frustrated they you give them a toy just to be taken away from them immediately after. I refused to make my son open presents. His sisters opened a few for him, and then I just left the rest there for whenever he felt like doing it. Eventually they all got opened.", "Horrible yes, but also wedding trumps one year old\u2019s bday. Kid is not even going to remember that.", "You could not have the party at all and it wouldn\u2019t matter to the kid. LOL", "We had IVF, and our daughter was born 1 yr and 1 day before our wedding.  We lost her twin sister.  When we were married the day after her first birthday, we just had some cheesecake with some friends the night before and chilled.  No big deal.  It made no difference to her, and we weren\u2019t going to stress about it.  Believe me, she never cared, and still doesn\u2019t.  She\u2019ll be 13 in a month.", "I baked a cake and it\u2019s likely my mom came up so including kiddo we had 4 total. Mostly he was interested in putting frosting EVERYWHERE. This party is for OP, and she\u2019s shooting herself in the foot.", "I remarried  and we each had a daughter about the same age (8/9).  The other parents did not have much contact.  As adults, they call each other their sister.  They have a good relationship.", "When I was a little child, we lived in an apartment above my nonna and great aunt, and lived 2 blocks from my grandparents. My sister came along when I was 6 and we had to move to a bigger place. I (in my child-eyes) lost my nonna and aunt, my room, my house, my school, my friends, well my entire life. And I wanted a brother, not a sister.\n\nI think I hated her for about 6 months tops maybe because who holds a lifelong grudge for something like that from when they were 6 years old? Weird.", "I\u2019m not sure therapy would help her. She\u2019s in the \u201cwhat about me\u201d I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be open to hearing she\u2019s wrong from an actual therapist\u2026.", "This. OP cares more about having that emotional gotcha than she actually cares about her daughter.", "OP\u2019s mom sounds like a lovely person, honestly.", "If my mother ever wanted a redo of my first birthday party I'd be all for it if it meant I'd get a cake all to myself."]}
