My mother is a nice person, but not practical. She never got around learning the new language properly or earned our living expenses (which was understandable with 2 small children). From the first day on, I was the breadwinner and problem solver, despite being a teenager myself.\n\nTBH Mama was often the source of our problems, with irrational decisions or incompetence. To her defense, our previous life had not taught her how to live in poverty.\n\nWe grew up, built carriers, started doing a bit better. My baby brother and I continued to take care of Mama. 2 years ago, I found a flat close to my own home and furnished it for her nicely. I take her to the doctors, monitor her finances, buy her groceries etc.\n\nLast year Mama asked BB to send a considerable amount of money to one of our distant relatives. He was fairly reluctant, but he paid. She had promised to pay back shortly after, which she actually did. I was still not very happy about it and I told BB that he should not give in to our mother's guilt trip.\n\nSure enough, a few months later the same lady asked Mama for help. Mama diverted the request to her personal banker, AKA baby brother. This time, our relative couldn't pay back.\n\nI was fuming. When I confronted Mama, she said that it was the moral duty of BB to help, because he had the means to do so. I argued that 1) having a saving account with a few thousand $ doesn't turn one into Warren Buffet and 2) BB should be able to choose the time, the manner and the amount of humanitarianism he wishes to display.\n\nShe claimed that I just didn't like our relative (not true - besides, it doesn't matter). She said it was not my money and consequently, not my business at all (true, I guess). She said that I was cold-hearted and manipulative.\n\nThis was the point when I threatened her. I'm not proud of it, but I truly had enough of her bullying BB into submission, who had sacrificed enough. I told her that if she ever dared to ask him for a similar kind of help again, I would call our relatives and explain to them that our mother was pressing him to send money to them, even if he didn't want or could.\n\nI was suspecting that deep down, aside from philanthropic, noble motives that my mother undoubtedly has, she wanted to show off a bit; being generous at BB's expenses. It would be devastating for her if anyone found out how she behaved towards him.\n\nAfterwards, I told BB what had been going on. He approved of every word I had said.\n\nNow our mother basically has broken with me. She doesn't let me know when she needs help. Last week, she slipped on the street and hurt herself. I didn't find out until I saw the injuries days later.\n\nShe is old, invalid and depressed. Shall I give in and apologise to her, so she lets me take care of her again? Have I meddled in something that is ultimately not my business? Am I truly a cold-hearted person?\n\nPS: Sorry for my poor English.", "created_utc": 1673428264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1090d3x/aita_for_protecting_my_brother/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You told her you would honestly expose the situation if she did it again - that she was using someone else's money to make herself look good.  That's fair.\n\nSince BB totally approved, you clearly handled it appropriately.  You are not cold-hearted.  I expect she asked BB rather than you because you won't put up with her manipulation.\n\nYou could apologize for being harsh, to try to make peace.  Don't go back on what you said though, about telling them if she does it again.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your brother are not her personal piggy banks.\n\nSounds like yall need to have a heart to heart on this. (You and mom, I mean). Because it would suck if this completely ruined your relationship, but your mom probably needs you in spite of her flaws.\n\nMaybe find a way to apologize for hurting her feelings without apologizing for your actions?", "NTA. This \u2018over generosity\u2019 of your mom using your BB\u2019s money helps to put her in good standing with her relatives no matter what it costs others. It is very selfish of her and unthinking.", ">She never got around learning the new language properly or earned our living expenses (which was understandable with 2 small children).\n\nYou are cutting your mom *way* too much slack. Not learning the language is one thing, assuming she can get by without it. But parents have a responsibility to provide for their children. It doesn't matter if they are small - all children start out small. Bare-minimum parents provide for their children.", "Honestly, it sounds as though she needs you way more than you need her.\n\nDon't apologise. Your brother approved your actions, and while you could apologise for having been harsh, it sounds as though this isn't the first time you have talked to her about this and she's ignored you. \n\nWhat you can do is tell her that you remain willing to help her out if she needs helps , that she hs your number etc and you're happy for her to call you if she needs help with the Doctor etc. \n\nIf you apologise all she is going to learn is that stopping speaking to you for a bit gets results.\n\n  \nTlak to your brother as well, let hm know that she is isn't speaking to you at present, that you've made clear to her that you remain willing to help her and the bal is in hr court, that way, it's harder for her to play the two of you off agaisnt each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd also suggest to your brother that the two of you make it a rule that you don't either of you give her money or promise money without talking to the other first,. If you get in thr habit of saying something like \"I'll need to check whetherI can afford it\" and then each speak to the other, you're more likely to be able to say no and stick to it as you're making it harder for her to push you into it on the spur of the meoment, plus it means each of you knows what the other is doing to help her out or give her money, so you can both have a bettre idea of whether she actually needs halp, and you avoid the risk of both funding the same request! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are definitely not cold hearted. It's one thing to help support your own mother (although you are not under an obligation to do that) it's quite another for her to give away your money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if the family member needs your help, they can always contact you directly and you can make a decison based on what they need, why, and what your relationship with them is.  And again, you don't have  any obligation. Even igf yur country / culture of origin has a strong emphasis on family members supporting each other, it sounds as thoug hyou haven't ever really benefitted from that as you were n't living in that community, so there isn't much of the 'these people supported you as a child, therefore you should support then when youare an adult and can do so' community spirit.", "NTA \n\nBut why don\u2019t you and your siblings set a small amount aside for her each month- she can then donate from it to whoever she wants. That way her pride is taken care of and she feels good that she is able to help whoever she wants", "ESH. You are right in that your brother shouldn't have to give money to people he doesn't even know just because they are relatives, and your mom says so. \n\nBut you were also wrong in the way you said it to your mother. You could have explained your reasoning in a calm and collected way. It's not like your brothers life was at stake, and if she wouldn't listen, you could still try to explain your reasoning to your brother. And if he then still would have chosen to give in to your mothers wishes, you would have had to accept that.\n\nI think you should apologise to her, explain that you are sorry for your rudeness, but also carefully explain why that you still hold that believe, but its okay if she thinks differently.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's why I felt the need to talk to her in the first place.", "You're exactly right. I'm better off financially, but I also speak our native language better than my brother, especially the pronounciation of the word \"no\". This is why she wouldn't ask me :)", "Sure, but that's not the point I wanted to make. I just emphesised that we, her children, have worked for every penny we own now. It's not inherited or something.", "True, I don't need her, but she is my mother and I care for her well-being.\nShe can't play us against each other. We have a strong bond. He just made a mistake of hiding it from me on her request.\nYes, in our culture you are obliged to help eachother, but we barely know these relatives. My mother has never met this particular person, but believes in the value of blood connections. We left the old country before our relative was even born.\nYou are assuming correctly. Community doesn't come into it. We don't owe them anything, if you ask me. When we were the ones struggeling, I never even thought of asking relatives for help, although some of them were wealthy. That's actually one of my points: why can't this person ask closer relatives of her for help, who live in her direct neighbourhood?", "I did explain my POV calmly, at first. 3K characters don't allow me to recite the whole conversation. She was not listening to reason, so at some point, it escalated. You probably know how families can be :)", "You did the right thing. It's sad she decided to cut you off but hopefully she will come around", "It mostly highlights that she gave you nothing but expects everything.", "Yeah, I know the situation, I really do, I know the type. \n\nThing is, if she doesn't listen, what use is it to continue arguing and escalating? She's not gonna change her opinion because of your arguments, so wouldn't it be better to leave it at that once you had explained your reasons? All it did is that now she is sad because of you.", "She gave us life and love.", "My goal was not winning the argument for its own sake or making her see it my way in order to feel superior, but stopping her from bullying my brother, which I only achieved by hurting her feelings. Yet I can see that this makes me the A-Hole at the end.", "No, she's sad because of her own choices and her own inability to see reason. OP is NTA - except insofar that it sounds like they have never drawn any boundaries for her and have indulged her all the way. She's not a child. Just because she is older doesn't mean she can't be treated rationally.", "Eh. Sometimes hurting someone\u2019s feelings is necessary to get them to stop a problem behavior. Her bullying and begging for money is harming your brother, so it needs to stop.", "NTA, your moms be projecting, calling you all that while she herself is forcing your brother and pressuring him into giving his hard-earned money for frivolous reasons.", "NTA and you need to put some distance between you and mommy dearest, who clearly has some mental health issues. Is there any way perhaps you could afford a care giver of some sort who could go for a few hours a day to her house to help with groceries, doctor's appointments and such?", "We understand that part. The part that we're upset about is that it appears your mother moved to a new country and expected her teenage children to provide for *her* when that is not how that is supposed to work. That was not okay with her, she shoved her responsibilities onto her teenage sons. I would understand if she had made some kind of effort but it makes it sound like she didn't make any kind of effort at all. Made you two translate and work for her. That is *abuse*. \n\nIf she won't tell you when she needs help anymore, it might be time to look into assisted living for her. Not a home, but they do have places where a person has their own apartment but still gets help with groceries and basic things they need done around the house.", "The person has probably gotten all the money close people will give. The close people probably also stopped giving because of the bs they spent money on. If it is cultural for your family to help, one would have to ask themselves why no one living in the culture is willing to help. Or why this person is asking people far away who can be easily lied to for money versus family \"down the street\".", "Valid questions. It may be that your mother has overstated your sucess so people back home see you are wealthy and/or that they are not aware of the differneces in costs of living so may genuinely think you are much better off than you really are.\n\nI think my advice is still the same, though . You love her, you can make clear to her that you still care about her andthat you remain willing to provide \\*her\\* woth the same practical help and support as before, but that you did the right thing and so won't be apologisong . \n\nAfter all, if these family meber s want help, they can ask you o your brother directly , or she can \\*ask\\* you if you are able to help, the issue seems to be with her promising others your/your brother's money, and then trying to put pressure on you to give.", "Which is the bare minimum as a parent.", "Very poetic and very true. You OP are a good man.", "Below the bare minimum. Food, clothing and shelter is the bare minimum.", "NTA\n\nI don't know how old your mother is, but there's a direct connection between being elderly and being easily scammed. Old people can get lonely and want connections. Their memory can start to go and they forget.\n\nThere's also the fact that your mother is choosing not to tell you she's being injured. That's a horrifying thing to do. It's possibly the worst manipulation tactic I've ever seen.\n\nIf your mother is competent, she's choosing not to inform you if injuries out of a personal vendetta. Giving into her once would mean she could use it to get her way again.\n\nYour mother's life has shown that she chooses not to be competent with money. She's giving away money that isn't her own and making her children pay for it. It's not an acceptable emergency like your aunt needs money because it's an emergency and your mom is asking because of an emergency. She's just doing what she wants.\n\nIs there a possibility that your mother never learned the value of money because she never had to? How often did someone else support her with money?\n\nIt sounds like you've spent your whole life being the parent and your mother is the child.\n\nGiven your mother's age, her behavior, and her track record, giving her a solid boundary is way over do. Don't let her cross it. She's treating you like a bank and doing what she wants. It's abusive behavior.\n\nIn my opinion, your mother needs more then boundaries. Again, your mother's's, behavior, and track record show that she's not trustworthy. Now, she's at an age where she's potentially easily taken advantage of and purposely being cruel because she didn't get her way.\n\nYou need to treat your mother the way she needs to be treated. If she's being taken advantage of because of age related issues, then someone could take more from her while her issues only get worse. Talk to her about an evaluation and put checks on her behavior. \n\nThere are bank cards where you can preload an amount of cash every month. I've done it with my grandmother because  it's easy, lets me monitor purchases, and is reloadable. If you use something like that, you're not being cruel to your mother. You're keeping her safe whenll you don't know if she can do that herself. \n\nUsing something like that card would also be evidence of competentcy. Your mother would have x amount to spend. Spending it all would be on her. It's not your responsibility to reload it if she runs out. It would just prove weather or not she can take care of herself.", "NTA.\n\n\"I was suspecting that deep down, aside from philanthropic, noble motives that my mother undoubtedly has, she wanted to show off a bit; being generous at BB's expenses.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShowing off is 100% the only motive. There is no philanthropy here. If she cared about anyone, she would care about her son, your BB.\n\nYou are not cold-hearted. You are sane. You just draw a line with your mother who seems to have constantly caused issues for you and your brother growing up, and even now. Enough is enough. Despite everything, she is an adult. She can choose to be more responsible for herself. Or she can choose to play this grand person while making life hard for her children.", "NTA. Not you or BB job to support anyone. If mom thinks it, is she needs to find employment of her own to support them. She may feel obligated that doesn't mean you two are. Don't be guilted into giving.", "NTA and your English is fine. Your mother is an entitled, petulant woman. You have done right throughout all this.", "Dont give in to her. \n\nNTA. Her generosity was not sustainable.  She will have to work her way through this.", " It is very selfish of her and unthinking."]}
