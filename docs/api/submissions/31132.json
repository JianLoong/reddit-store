You brought those appliances for everyone to use, but if your roommates can't respect your belongings and boundaries, then it's absolutely fair for you to take them with you temporarily.

Classic FAFO", "NTA - it\u2019s your stuff (and it doesn\u2019t sound like there was an agreement you got, say, reduced rent in exchange), and if they want appliances, they should buy their own. But it\u2019s not great roommate behaviour either; why would you care if they had people over and you were packing?", "NTA for wanting to protect your property, although I don't think this is about appliances at all. Why do your roommates have to ask your permission to have guests over when you are not present? Do you own the house? If you don't it sounds strange to me that you should be the one to decide when the others do and do not have visitors. Personally I would hate to be in a roommate situation, and I would hate it even more if my roommates and I had vastly different standards of cleanliness and tidyness. At the same time I am sure I couldn't accept it if one roommate would act as self-appointed boss of the other roommates.", "NTA. It's your stuff.", "Be prepared to keep all those things in your room when you return because I guarantee the roommates will replace them and ban you from using theirs.\nPlus they will go out of their way to invite people over and you won\u2019t be able to stop them.", "How old are the people commenting on this? Stop fueling the fire. It sucks. You have to live together. Try and resolve things or at least calm them rather than make it worse. YTA ESH you have until lease is up so make it easy on yourself at least.", "It\u2019s a weirdly petty reaction. You share a dorm. Do they not get equal votes? You got outvoted. \n\nYTA simply because the one has nothing to do with other and you\u2019re looking to increase tensions rather than defuse them. Leave the shit at home and look into changing rooms.", "It's your stuff to do with as you darn well please.", "ESH. Taking away the microwave is really petty, Leila is right.", "YTA.... you don't own the house. You are all renting it together.

Packing 10 guests into an 800-square-foot apartment *that you already share with several people and their belongings* is something that you should have to clear with *all* of your roommates. If someone objects, too bad so sad, have your get-together at someone else's house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP objected because she had homework and packing to do, and because the friends in question had previously been disruptive and acted badly toward another of the roommates.
