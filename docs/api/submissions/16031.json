May lives with me along with her (large) dog. Now here is the issue. May is \"self-diagnosed\" I can't say let alone won't say exactly what it is, but as far as I am concerned all she has is a classic case of depression.  She moved in with me when this all started and I had no qualms under the condition that she maintain a job, save her money to get back on her feet, and see a therapist or find some sort of way to help manage it. For the past 6 months she has called off work, taken sick and vacation day after day, and I am pretty sure she is pretty close to losing her job.She saw a therapist for a few weeks but hasn't been back since and since she has used up her sick leave I am the one paying for it because her insurance won't cover this particular therapist. Her bedroom is a mess, there is garbage everywhere dirty dishes, stains, food scraps, and her laundry is just disgusting. I have tried to help when I can like doing her laundry, but at almost 30 I would expect someone to be able to clean up after themselves. Now onto the real issue: May has a 4 year old dog. The dog is nice enough, but it's very large and very strong. Whatever the breed is it requires a lot of exercise to which May has been slacking in. This is leading to the dog to become VERY destructive. Chewing on the furniture, tearing the pillows and couch, and reliving itself everywhere. I still work, I am gone all day. I am not home to watch or walk this dog, May is. **I have told he time and time again that she needs to take care of the dog, she needs to walk the dog, she needs to exercise the dog because I can't.** I physically cannot. her response is the same: \"I can't I have depression' or a similar response but with the same underlying meaning.\n\nThis is where I might be the AH. After coming home yesterday night, the dog had made a complete mess in the living room but the final straw was the fact the dog had torn up my brand new couch. I was livid. I had given her one to many chances and opportunities but this was it. I called up the neighbor boys, loaded the dog into the car, and took it to the nearest shelter. After coming home a few hours later, May decides to make an appearance to ask where her dog is and I told her. Cue the screaming match. I was accused I could have done more for the dog and if I really loved her and understood her situation I would have just took care of the dog while she took \"care of herself\". She has now locked herself in her room and is refusing to come out claiming what I did was redeemable and everyone will know what a monster I was and proceed to call up the whole family dragging them into this nonsense. Now the whole family is involved and divided on this. AITA?\n\nEdit: for those of you commenting, the dog is legally mine. its my name on the papers, and its my name on the vet bills. She wanted a dog and I didn't have an issue.

It is *her* dog and *her* responsibility. This was not a matter of you not dog sitting when she had to run out, this was a matter of her forcing the work of dog ownership onto you while she had the enjoyment.  The fact that you are paying the bills only further demonstrates her apathy towards the dog. Additionally, dogs more frequently treat these conditions; they can give us positive energy and something to focus on. Caring for that dog should have been how she picked herself up and avoided therapy.\n\nThe fact that you tolerated as much as you did is remarkable.", "NTA. I know people suffer from depression and sometimes it takes all the will you have to just get out of the bed. Your daughter is lucky that you are providing her shelter. Even in her state she should respect the boundaries that comes with staying with someone else. If she is not able to take care of the dog then it's not your responsibility as well. It's already mentally draining to take a care of a adult up with depression . You don't have to come home from work and take care of the dog as well. Hope your daughter feels better but clearly you are NTA", "Depression is not an excuse for your daughter to keep herself in the conditions you described. It is your house and  you are not obligated  to let her keep it filthy due to depression.  So clean it  (I doubt she will) and make certain she keeps it clean.  Secondly you tried to get her to walk the dog, feed it and care for it but she responded \"I can't I have depression.\" So you are not in the wrong for sending the dog to a shelter.  It's better for the dog and yourself that way. If \"depression\" was going to keep her from being a responsible dog owner, she shouldn't be throwing a tantrum over this outcome. Depression is a very real condition but it sounds like your daughter is just using the label to shirk her responsibilities.", "NTA. Clearly nobody in your house is adequately able to care for the dog. Hopefully a new owner will be able to do so.", "Going against the grain to say NTA. I feel for May because I've been at that point in my depression before, but if you've tried getting her to take care of the dog and given her warnings, then I do think you tried your best to get things to the point where you could keep the dog. It's probably really devastating to her to lose her dog but if she isn't at a point where she can care for a dog then she shouldn't have one imo. Having a dog isn't a right, it's a privilege. I had to re-home my pet during the worst of my depression and it was a struggle, but ultimately I knew it was the right thing to do because my dog deserved better.", "***If*** this was a no-kill shelter and *if* everything else you added in comments is true, NTA. She can\u2019t care for the dog, because she\u2019s ill. You can\u2019t care for the dog, because you have to work/it\u2019s not physically possible. The dog deserves better. If you warned her and gave her chances to alleviate the problem and she didn\u2019t - even if she didn\u2019t because she couldn\u2019t - then this was a sad but necessary choice.", "I really hope that you took the dog to a no-kill shelter at the very least.", "NTA. Your daughter abused the animal via neglect and you have placed it appropriately for rehoming. Hopefully it will get the attention it needs in its new home.", "NTA your daughter should be grateful you've put up with her making you live in that condition for that long. If it were me I would have removed both her and the dog from my home but I hope this is a wake-up call for her to take care of her condition more seriously.", "NTA I have Depression and I have 2 large breed dogs. They are also both under 2 years old. Even on days that I don\u2019t have motivation it doesn\u2019t take to much effort to make something to occupy the both of them of course it\u2019s a bit easier for me because they have each other to play with", "I think your daughter's depression has reached the stage where she needs some inpatient time.  She may be past the point at which outpatient therapy can get her back on her feet.", "Good for you. Next step is \"Get therapy now!\" with a hard deadline. You can't help someone who doesn't want it. However you also have every right to look after yourself first.", "NTA. Sounds like rehoming your daughter should be your next step.", "NTA there's a certain number of people with depression who can handle a pet, and she's not one of them. I've seen some people say that they wouldn't be able to get out of bed if they didn't have their pet they need to care for, and use it as motivation. They use the energy they feel to care for it to also do their own chores and care for themselves, and that's a really good way to get some people moving. However if May can't drag herself up to even care for the dog, she doesn't need it, she's not one of those people.", "NTA but I would\u2019ve re-homed the daughter AND the dog!", "Rehoming a dog is finding another home for it, not dumping it at a shelter. Did you ask them if they are a kill shelter?\n\nESH except the poor dog surrounded by AHs.", "ESH but I\u2019m really hoping it was a no kill shelter. Depression is no excuse, I have it but I still do my best to do what I have to everyday. However it\u2019s not the dogs fault it\u2019s not being taken care of correctly. Dogs that are overly energetic need lots of attention and when they don\u2019t get that they act up. I think putting the dog in a shelter was impulsive and since your the one that legally owns the dog, technically it is actually your dog. You should\u2019ve instead taken the time to get it a good home where it\u2019s not being treated the way you two are treating it. Again, I really hope it wasn\u2019t put in a kill shelter. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for the daughter to use depression as an excuse for everything but I also don\u2019t agree with the impulsive act to throw the dog in the shelter because of that.", "I just think of that poor dog and I hope it\u2019s not a shelter that will kill him. It wasn\u2019t his fault and I hope he gets a loving home. \n\nI\u2019m going to say ESH. You\u2019re allowing your daughter to continue adding chaos to your home and she\u2019s not contributing to the household. That poor dog deserved you trying to find a good home for him instead of suddenly being dumped in an unknown place. Your daughter also deserved a conversation if you were going to get rid of her pet.", "NTA tell your daughter she has 60 days to get her shit together and move out. She's an adult who needs to learn how to manage her mental health issues. She has the support from you to do so if she doesn't want to take control of her life that's on her.she shouldn't have gotten the dog if she wasn't going to take care of it. Any family members saying differently can take her in or mind their business", "ESH\n\nI don't fault you for your frustrations with her inability to properly care for herself, let alone the dog, and I would imagine the dog would do better in a home with someone willing and able to properly exercise them. But taking the dog out of the blue and just giving it to a shelter without saying anything is just brutally messed up, especially knowing how apparently fragile your daughter's mental health is. I think you should go get the dog back if you can, because I know if I was in a similar situation, it might take potentially years before I would be able to trust you again.", "Chronic fatigue syndrome? That's a real thing and there is treatment for it.", "You have every right to not want a dog ruining your home and expecting it to be properly taken care of. However, YTA for punishing the dog. You did not re-home it, you abandoned it at a shelter in the heat of the moment with no guarantee that it will survive or make it out of there. If you had re-homed it to a new *home*, which I guarantee you could have done (or at least tried), that would be different. Also, you can't hide behind a defense that it's your dog so you had the right to do what you wanted with it but it's also not your dog so it's not your responsibility to care for it. It either is your dog or it's not.\n\nYour feelings are justified, but you could have (and imo should have) made better choices in your actions.\n\nEdit: I'd go as far as ESH because daughter should at least realize she is unable to properly care for the dog and want the best for it if she is incapable.", "YTA \n\nYou can\u2019t have it both ways. In your original post you say it\u2019s May\u2019s dog and she was not taking care of it, but then when called out on getting rid of someone else\u2019s dog you say it\u2019s actually your dog. If you signed the adoption papers than you have a responsibility to making sure the dog is cared for and neglecting your responsibility and then dumping the dog at a shelter is a shitty thing to do. Also, you know there\u2019s issues in your home between the dog and May yet you thought hmm, this is the perfect time to get a brand new couch - it kinda feels like a setup so you\u2019d have a final straw. \n\nYour daughter has real issues and it sounds like she needs serious help, I hope that she gets it. Your home was not a good fit for this dog but you went about this in the worst way possible.", "YTA. If you had re-homed the dog and not dumped it at a shelter you wouldn\u2019t have been TA.", "YTA for the mere fact you didn't rehome the dog. Apparently you don't know the meaning of the word Rehome.  \nI would assume for you being 60 years old you would know the meaning.  But since it is obvious you don't know here you go; rehome noun ; to find a new owner for a pet, especially a dog or cat, usually after caring for it for a time.\n\nNo what you did is take it to a shelter. And not once have you said that the shelter was a no kill shelter.  Makes you a massive AH\nSo you are aware the dog possibly has 72 hours before it is put down. Or did you not know that little fact. \n\nAnd not once did you even I don't know even entertain getting dog training and crate training.\n\nYou and your daughter are both AH'S  and I hope your happy knowing you killed that dog. Becuase that is exactly what you did.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter has depression and your solution is to get rid of something she loves? That's DEFINITELY going to make things worse,  and you probably irreparably damaged your relationship with her.  I'd go no contact SO FAST if someone got rid of my pets. \n\nNot to mention, you are punishing that poor animal for things outside of its control.  It's a living thing,  4 years old.  Can you imagine how scared and confused it must be right now? Animals have feelings and that poor thing is probably terrified and alone. Not to mention, many shelters will euthanize \"problem\" animals, so not only did you take your daughter's beloved pet away,  you very likely got it killed. \n\nAlso YTA for acting like depression is just some everyday nonsense.  \n\nDo you even care about your child?", "Could\u2019ve been a bit less impulsive about the dog. You had time to find it a proper home. \n\nThat being said, maybe use that energy on your daughter? Every single time I see my family members \u201crescue\u201d their struggling kids it ends up as a vacation from life for the (adult) child. If she\u2019s not seeking help, not trying therapy/meds/anything you can either force it on her or pack bags.", "ESH. I get that depression is no excuse for your daughter behaving the way she is (speaking as someone who is dealing with it) but you also suck for punishing the dog. The fact that you can\u2019t answer everyone that\u2019s asking you if it was a no kill shelter makes me think that you honestly didn\u2019t care at all about the dog either so you dumped it at the first shelter you could possibly find. Back in my teens I volunteered at my local animal shelter only to find out soon after I started it was a kill shelter. I didn\u2019t go back because they treat the animals like crap! I sincerely hope you go get this dog back and at least put in the effort to find him an actual good home!", "YTA. It does sound like your daughter is struggling with pretty severe depression and it sounds like you\u2019re having a hard time either accepting this or you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s very serious. \n\nAs someone who\u2019s struggled with depression in the past, selfcare and keeping up with responsibilities can incredibly hard for some. Even things like doing laundry or getting up to walk the dog become dreadful. While she doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s in the proper headspace to care for an animal, dumping the dog off at the shelter was unfair to both her and the dog. She deserved a warning or at least a chance to rehome her pet", "YTA with a side of ESH. The appropriate response to this situation is to kick your daughter and the dog out. She's not holding up her end of the bargain, and you don't deserve to live with a dog that destroys your home. Period. What you did was wrong and likely illegal, since it wasn't legally your dog to surrender.\n\nBTW, \"all she has is a classic case of depression\" is a VERY AH thing to say, that alone swayed me to the YTA. Depression is a serious illness and it can make it impossible to function.\n\nYou have every right to kick her out of your house--you had no right to steal her dog and surrender it illegally.", "You need to tell May to get a counselor and go. She needs to try a few different ones to find one that fits. Second she needs an appointment with a doctor to check her general health. You are going to need to use tough love. If she can not help herself her moves. If not you are going to rehire with her in a bedroom. A counselor for you may help you with the steps.", "ESH (assuming it was a no-kill shelter)\n\nIt comes down to one simple premise for me.   Big dogs are great, but they require a lot of love, and attention, and work.  And if May wasn\u2019t interested in taking care of that dog\u2026 then how good of a life could she have possibly provided that dog.   I\u2019m not interested in defending dog owners who can\u2019t be bothered to take care of their dogs.  And if May had her own place, I suspect the dog would be acting just the same way.   So I get why you\u2019d want to get rid of the dog.  And I sincerely hope it was to a non-kill shelter. \n\nBut on the flip side of it\u2026 that dog is legally her property.   And I get she\u2019s in a depression, and it sounds like she has real issues to sort out\u2026 but this was never going to help her along now is it?   You were mad about a couch, and the mess, and this was more to make yourself feel better than it was to help May or the dog out.\n\nSo I hope you both are able to go back to the shelter together, and get the dog back.  Maybe this incident will have scared May into taking the dog more seriously, and making sure it\u2019s clean.  I\u2019d also suggest you both do therapy together.   If May isn\u2019t interested in therapy, or receiving help\u2026 as hard as it sounds, then maybe it\u2019s time she move out.   She\u2019s not getting better living with you then, so it might be time to try something new.", "ESH. It's reasonable for you to want the dog out of your house, but you don't just get rid of somebody's dog as a surprise. You need to have the guts to confront her about it.\n\nIt doesn't matter whose dog it legally is. You acknowledged it as your daughters dog.", "ESH. She is your daughter and you got the dog for her in your name.

She absolutely doesn't deserve to have the dog if she won't take care of it properly, it's a living thing that needs her, and it sounds like she's using her condition as an excuse to let other things fall apart despite consequences, but you should have at least told her she has one last straw or maybe found someone you know or are able to contact to give the dog to so at least it's not just in the system unable to be found.", "If your name is on the adoption papers and vet bills, then why weren\u2019t you helping to look after the dog? \n\nI hope the dog survives and gets a far better home that he had with you.\n\nYTA", "ESH, I know what it\u2019s like having depression where my dogs were literally the only thing that got me through it at times.

While there does appear to be some issues of the depression being used by your daughter as an excuse in some aspects, this does not justify the way you did/are acting in response.\n\nBreaking it down, there\u2019s a few key things I noticed: \n\n1. \u201c\u2026at almost 30\u201d The ableism here is blatant. The misconception of acting as though a disorder checked ID is far too common and just all too common. Like as far as I\u2019m aware, illness typically doesn\u2019t just decide like \u201coh you\u2019re almost 30? damn must\u2019ve missed that, that symptom was for 25 and under, apologies!\u201d \n\n2.

Like an example scale for the day might be:\n\n1-10 (1 being possible, 10 being impossible)\n\n10- Walking the dog outside the house\n5- Playing tug of war with dog for 15 minutes \n1- Watching youtube videos with dog training tips\n\n10- Cleaning entire room top to bottom\n5- Pick one section (Bed, Nightstand, Dresser, Ect.) to clean up And set 15 minute timer. At the end of each 15 minutes, gage energy level, and either stop when feeling the fatigue or reset timer for another 15 minutes. \n1-Choose an item to pick up all of. Pick up just the wrappers or just the tshirts or just empty bottles etc.\n\n10- Wash, Dry, Fold, and switch laundry.\n5- She washes, you fold and dry, she puts away\n1- She organizes the clothes in piles, so the load is ready to wash\n\nAnd based on a 3-30 scale for the day, if she was at say a 12, doing 2 tasks that are a \u201c5\u201d and one \u201c1\u201d task leaves here with only \u201c1\u201d energy to do everything else, including eating, showering, making calls, getting dressed, socializing, ect. Which is why establishing how much energy a task uses is so vital in recovery. \n\n3. While rehoming her dog felt like a last straw for you, clearly it was a blindside to her since she was confused to where the dog was.

I say this as someone who has been treated for depression for many years.\nIf she doesn't find a doctor and doesn't follow the treatment, it's time to \"re-home\" her too, after all, you can't care about grown woman who doesn't care about anything and is not willing to make any effort, or to respect her own mother who provides her with a home and all the care.", "NTA for rehoming the dog.\n\nHowever, your attitude towards her mental illness seems a little ignorant. \"All she has is a classic case of depression.\" You're expecting May to be fully functional when she has a debilitating illness that makes getting through what would be a normal day for non-depressed people a monumental task for people who do have depression. \n\nMay's room is filthy because she likely doesn't have the physical or mental energy to keep it clean. She couldn't attend to the dog's needs because of the same thing, and you were right to rehome it. But expecting her to work, keep her room tidy, and function as normal just because of her age is unrealistic. \n\nDepression can affect anyone at any age, because it's an illness, and that's how illness works. You can't say \"you're almost thirty, you shouldn't be getting the flu, or cancer, or lupus, and I expect you to function as if you're fit and healthy because you're old enough to not let it affect you.\"\n\nMay has an illness. A long-term, medical condition that you seem to be underestimating because you apparently don't understand how totally overwhelming it can be. If you want to help May, please read up on what depression is, what forms it can come in, since there isn't just one type, and how it can adversely affect people suffering from it.\n\nWhen you have depression, you can often suffer from bone-deep exhaustion. You can spend your days exhausted. You might get a good night's sleep if you're lucky, and still wake up and be exhausted. Just doing the bare minimum of getting out of bed and going to the bathroom can be enough to sap your energy. Eating, bathing, brushing your hair & teeth, getting dressed, can become monumental efforts, nevermind cooking, cleaning and going to work.\n\nYou can become slow and sluggish. You can be in physical pain 24/7 from the tip of your toe to the top of your head. Your thought processes can become foggy and entangled. Your focus and concentration can disappear. You can become suicidal at the drop of a hat. It can be like wading neck-deep through an ocean of molasses in the dark, and any glimmer of light is so far away that you don't think you'll ever be able to reach it.\n\nIt can take months to physically recover from one day of activity. That might be why May's calling in sick-- she's chronically fatigued from an exhausting illness that saps the life, strength and energy from her every single day. You're probably not seeing that because it's an invisible illness. And because it's highly subjective, even if you had depression yourself, your experience of it might be very different to hers.\n\nHopefully, with a little time, May will see that you did the right thing by the dog. She's upset now because she probably feels lonely and isolated and the dog was the one thing in her life that gave her unconditional love without judging her. She might see it as you taking away her lifeline. Your correct action on rehoming the dog might feel to her like you're punishing her for being ill. She might even see it as you rejecting her. So try and be understanding on that front.\n\nMay's depression might be frustrating for you as her parent, but it's probably ten times that for her.", "YTA \nThis is your dog not your daughters dog.

It wasn't getting the care or attention it needed and was acting out--and that, left unchecked, can cause a lot of damage to the dog (as well as your house).  \n\nI've been crushed with depression in my life and I have cats.  In my worst throes of depression, yes, the litter boxes a few times went longer than they should have, but they got done and the cats were all fed and groomed--in fact, it was my need to take care of \\*them\\* that got me out of bed some mornings.  \n\nIf she can't do that, who's to say if she's not even more depressed than I was. But it's cruel to neglect an animal, especially a dog (because they have more needs than a cat, let's be honest).

Your daughter cannot even take care of herself, let alone an animal that is being cooped up all day because of her neglect. As you mentioned, not only is she at risk of losing her job, but her behavior/mental health is spiraling downwards.

See if she is able to take antidepressants or what methods she can do to learn to get back into a routine. You gave her an ultimatum and she's not keeping up with it.

But he is also 10kg, so his needs are a lot easier to manage than bigger dogs. I'll admit it was not my best decision to get a dog when I did, and I've been very lucky I have family that have helped me when I needed IP treatment. But regardless how sick I've been, I've always ensured his needs are met. Even when psychotic, I've ensured he is safe and his needs are met. In my crisis plan it even states he is to be treated as if I had children, if they think I need acute IP stay I have to be allowed to get him placed with my parents or sister and ensure he has food etc. So they won't just rush me to emergency unit, they allow me to go home and sort things out for him because they know his safety is my number one priority and I won't do anything that will risk his safety. Which includes taking advantage of that trust they grant me, because regardless how unwell I am, I would not be able to forgive myself if he had even a minute of not being safe or taken care of.

Everyone is talking about how they took responsibility when they were sick and that\u2019s awesome if you have the self awareness to reach that point. Lots of people with mental illness refuse medication or treatment because they don\u2019t believe they are sick, or they think they can handle it by themselves. This is why involuntary commitments are a thing. No one gets involuntarily committed for a heart condition. In many cases the commitment is so they can get some medicine in them so they CAN realize what\u2019s happening and take responsibility for following a treatment plan.
