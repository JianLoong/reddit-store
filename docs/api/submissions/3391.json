Our wedding planner is truly a saint and had no problem setting up passwords with vendors like some people suggested and it was a great suggestion so thank you.\n\nWe then invited my mom to dinner and told her that she has to stop trying to help us with the wedding.\n\nIt started off bad as she brought her binder and had her own wedding dress in her car. Her dress is in very bad condition, would not fit either me or my fianc\u00e9 and is quite frankly hideous. I would never say that to her face, though I've told her every time she's asked that I want to pick out my own dress and she should keep hers for if she wants to get remarried.\n\nShe assumed that we had invited her to apologize and let her plan the wedding however she wanted. How she jumped to that conclusion I have no idea.\n\nWe lied about not wanting her to get overly stressed in the hope she'd take it better then telling her that she's been causing problems and that she hasn't been helpful.\n\nShe didn't take it well and started crying, and saying all she ever wanted was for me to have the perfect wedding and she'd already given up getting the perfect son in law and grandchildren so at the least we could let her plan the wedding. It stunned us both as she has never said a bad word about me liking women, not when I came out, not when I got my first girlfriend, not when me and my fianc\u00e9 got engaged.\n\nThat put me over the edge and I told her that she wasn't going to plan anything, she was a guest and nothing more and I would be cutting her speech if she was going to behave like a child. She had a full on tantrum so me and my fianc\u00e9 paid and left her to cry and scream in the restaurant.\n\nThat was all fine and dandy until our florist called to tell us my mom had called to try and get the flower arrangements changed behind our back. I called her and she tried to lie until she realized she was backed into a corner and admitted to doing it because she knew what was best and was trying to help.\n\nNeedless to say that I've now uninvited her from the wedding with the full support of my fianc\u00e9 and my soon to be MIL and FIL.", "created_utc": 1669592173, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6gfbo/update_aita_for_telling_my_mom_if_she_wants_to/", "score": 1218, "replies": ["Wow!

You reached out, got advice and put it into effect in a fair, reasonable way. Your mom's reaction is not your fault. I physically cringed at that \"I gave up the perfect son in law and grandchildren\" thing, and you handled that perfectly, too. If she wants to make vile, hateful comments and whip up a circus in public (which is a pressure tactic people use when desperate to force their will on someone) the right thing to do is simply refuse to participate in her games. Thumbs up.\n\nBut to be realistic, I doubt this is over since she tried again to meddle with the florist. That goes back to having security at the wedding - the conversation at dinner did not get through to her, and since she continued trying to meddle and is willing to make a scene in public, you do have to be ready for the chance she crashes the wedding to start screaming at the gates to be let in. Luckily, it sounds like you've got a strong network in place, so I know you can handle any further stunts.\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming marriage.", "Oofta.

I can't carry a child because of health complications and me and my fianc\u00e9 have agreed that if we ever do have kids it won't be for at least a few years. Which isn't good enough for her, she wants us to pop out grandbabies for her yesterday", "We have set up passwords, but that didn't stop her from trying, the reason the florist called us was that my mom didn't give the password so the florist called to double check we wanted the changes which we of course didn't want", "O.

Your family is who you choose, not who you are related to by blood, thankfully.", "Wow I am sorry to hear all that happened but it is for the best.", "May you & your soon to be wife have a beautiful wedding that is YOUR dream, not your mom's. Good for both of you to grow from this.\n\nAs a mom of adults, one of the hardest things to do is to recognize that their dreams are not necessarily what you wish for them. AND THAT IS OK AND NORMAL.

But please, hire security to make sure she stays away.", "I wouldnsuggest a cease and desist or a restraining order.", "Man what a shitty situation for everyone involved. Especially for an important event.\n\nYour mom is being overbearing and overstepping boundaries and she is doing that because she's mom and she has some control issues. Her heart is misguided and she definitely told you why she is trying to control the whole situation and going behind your back. She lied because she knew you would be mad and probably think you would say no to her ideas. Definitely don't agree with how she is going about everything.\nYour mom is projecting her crushed hopes and dreams onto you with this wedding and maybe some underlying resentment about your sexuality(?) I would really hope not for your sake and all that is very sad. She said she wouldn't have grandchildren or a son in law. Your mom made a daydream/desire into expectation of what your life and her life would be when you were an adult at this exact moment. And this is what needs to be addressed.\nYou can certainly have children still, if wanted; you're both females or you can adopt as well if you both want children.\n\nIf I were you, I would talk to her alone and have a heart to heart and really get down to the root cause. Don't make it accusatory, just lead with compassion for your mom. If you show empathy she should follow suit \u2665\ufe0f\nHopefully this can be resolve. Example: \"Mom what's really going on? I feel there is something deeper than what's on the surface, is there anything you want to talk about and get off your chest? I feel the last time we talked, what was said about me being a lesbian and how you're never going to have grandchildren and a son in law really struck a cord with me and it has me concern. What's going on that has you hurting so much that it's interfering with the wedding to the point we had to reach an extreme place just to put a boundary down?\" Don't say I wanted you there or anything just in case she tries to manipulate the situation.\nAny relationship issues, always try to find the root cause.

OP has stated that the mum fully supported her when she came out and never said anything bad about the fiance. \n\nI think it's rather lazy to assume it is vile, hateful homophobia that she has secretly hidden all these years, rather than just craziness over the wedding day. Mum clearly has a lot of wedding specific issues and is turning into a Mother-of-the Bridezilla.\n\nTo be clear, OP is NTA and the mum is a huge AH and banning her was justified.", "Listen to your children\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe.

While not the same because my partner & I opted to not have a wedding, my mom said similar comments about how I was depriving her of her moments, life events, being a grandparent & so forth.

I can't even imagine her having a gay child she wouldn't cope. \n\nShe gets really crazy about certain things like my house plants it was a weird time, luckily my possum chewed them all and we don't have that problem now.", "First off, congratulations on your upcoming wedding. I\u2019m glad you and your fianc\u00e9 will get to have the wedding you both want, and not the one your mother does. \n\nSetting passwords is a great idea, I\u2019d also tell the wedding planner/venders what\u2019s going on, and ask them to contact you if someone calls them, claiming to be either of you, and tries to change/cancel anything. I wouldn\u2019t put it past your mom to continue to try to force her wishes, at this point. But that\u2019s from personal experience.\n\nMy friend in university had a similar problem with her future MIL, and when they told her no several times, she had the audacity to try to call the vender and caterers and try to cancel the first and change the food order to her chosen location, along with trying to change the food selection too. It was a nightmare for everyone. She got herself kicked out of the wedding, by trying to damage the bride\u2019s dress on the day of, after showing up post her invite being rescinded. They let her in, not wanting stress/a scene on their day. She said she was sorry, and wanted to help with the set up, general prep. \n\nI was around, because I was a plus one to a friend who\u2019s girlfriend had to cancel last minute. And got a rundown from a friend of the bride, as I volunteered to help with the prep. It was a pretty casual country wedding. The venue was an old barn in the country in autumn. They paid for it l themselves, and did what they could to keep the costs down. \n\nMIL wanted 5 stars, glam, pricy to the max. Her wanted venue was at a ritzy hotel. As I later became friends with the bride and groom, I quickly figured out that MIL\u2019s venue was the exact opposite of both of them. They are both easy going, and wanted their wedding to be fun for them too.\n\nThe bride was suspicious about her sniffing around the changing rooms/prep rooms, and asked a few of general wedding guests to watch her, and a few placed in other areas to keep her out of trouble. My \u2018date\u2019 found her trying to jimmy the locked prep room where the dresses were. The bridal party had gone to grab a quick snack before makeup and changing. There was a mass blowup between her and her son. At some point he grabbed her purse out of her hands, and dumped it on the table. There were kitchen scissors. We all knew what she had been planning. They still don\u2019t speak to her to this day, and this was 15 years ago, and 3 kids later, now. \n\nI did read your original post, but didn\u2019t comment as it seemed like others had said it for me. But your situation definitely reminded me of my friends. I\u2019ve belaboured on longer than I wanted, but memories\u2026. Have a great wedding!", "I'm really sorry you had to be blindsided with her stance on your sexuality, that had to have really sucked to put it lightly.
