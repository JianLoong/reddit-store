Our wedding planner is truly a saint and had no problem setting up passwords with vendors like some people suggested and it was a great suggestion so thank you.\n\nWe then invited my mom to dinner and told her that she has to stop trying to help us with the wedding.\n\nIt started off bad as she brought her binder and had her own wedding dress in her car. Her dress is in very bad condition, would not fit either me or my fianc\u00e9 and is quite frankly hideous. I would never say that to her face, though I've told her every time she's asked that I want to pick out my own dress and she should keep hers for if she wants to get remarried.\n\nShe assumed that we had invited her to apologize and let her plan the wedding however she wanted. How she jumped to that conclusion I have no idea.\n\nWe lied about not wanting her to get overly stressed in the hope she'd take it better then telling her that she's been causing problems and that she hasn't been helpful.\n\nShe didn't take it well and started crying, and saying all she ever wanted was for me to have the perfect wedding and she'd already given up getting the perfect son in law and grandchildren so at the least we could let her plan the wedding. It stunned us both as she has never said a bad word about me liking women, not when I came out, not when I got my first girlfriend, not when me and my fianc\u00e9 got engaged.\n\nThat put me over the edge and I told her that she wasn't going to plan anything, she was a guest and nothing more and I would be cutting her speech if she was going to behave like a child. She had a full on tantrum so me and my fianc\u00e9 paid and left her to cry and scream in the restaurant.\n\nThat was all fine and dandy until our florist called to tell us my mom had called to try and get the flower arrangements changed behind our back. I called her and she tried to lie until she realized she was backed into a corner and admitted to doing it because she knew what was best and was trying to help.\n\nNeedless to say that I've now uninvited her from the wedding with the full support of my fianc\u00e9 and my soon to be MIL and FIL.", "created_utc": 1669592173, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6gfbo/update_aita_for_telling_my_mom_if_she_wants_to/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Wow! Make sure security has her picture on your wedding day! Best of luck to you both \ud83d\udc8d\ud83d\udc8d", "Sad story.  You didn\u2019t have much choice.   Enjoy the process going forward!  Have a very happy wedding !", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your mother chose to work her angst into your wedding. She has a lot of apologizing to do. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd and congrats on your nuptials. \n\nPEOPLE WITH ADULT CHILDREN: Get therapy. Listen to your children. Apologize. Work hard to avoid making the same mistakes. You will die alone if you don\u2019t. That is all.", "My mind just boggles.  Glad that you've got that awkward discussion over with, and can sort-of move forward with the business of planning your wedding.  Best wishes.", " Oh hell hon... she sounds like such a hand full.\n\n I do hope you are having bouncers caues I can just see her trying to crash.\n\n\n  I do hope you have a beautiful wedding day", "if you haven\u2019t already, i suggest you take a look at the r/raisedbynarcissists sub", "I have to echo the comment about having security at the wedding... this sounds like a potential gate crasher if ever there was one.\n\nIf it helps at all, I think you and your fiancee handled this like true pros. You reached out, got advice and put it into effect in a fair, reasonable way. Your mom's reaction is not your fault. I physically cringed at that \"I gave up the perfect son in law and grandchildren\" thing, and you handled that perfectly, too. If she wants to make vile, hateful comments and whip up a circus in public (which is a pressure tactic people use when desperate to force their will on someone) the right thing to do is simply refuse to participate in her games. Thumbs up.\n\nBut to be realistic, I doubt this is over since she tried again to meddle with the florist. That goes back to having security at the wedding - the conversation at dinner did not get through to her, and since she continued trying to meddle and is willing to make a scene in public, you do have to be ready for the chance she crashes the wedding to start screaming at the gates to be let in. Luckily, it sounds like you've got a strong network in place, so I know you can handle any further stunts.\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming marriage.", "Oofta. Also,  does she not know that same gender couples can have kids?????", "That\u2019s so awful. Your mum seems rather unwell. \n\nYou need to give all of your vendors a password so she cannot cancel or change them.", "she's well aware but apparently it \"wouldn't count\" if we adopted or my fianc\u00e9 carried the child because biologically it wouldn't be *her* grandchild. I can't carry a child because of health complications and me and my fianc\u00e9 have agreed that if we ever do have kids it won't be for at least a few years. Which isn't good enough for her, she wants us to pop out grandbabies for her yesterday", "We have set up passwords, but that didn't stop her from trying, the reason the florist called us was that my mom didn't give the password so the florist called to double check we wanted the changes which we of course didn't want", "O. M. G. O.o", "Maybe point out then, that even if you were straight it would be be biologically yours because of health reasons. Surely she would be able to understand that?", "she's gotten it in her head if I was straight I wouldn't have health issues and that I should just try harder to have a child. All reasoning falls on deaf ears unfortunatly"]}
