Our wedding planner is truly a saint and had no problem setting up passwords with vendors like some people suggested and it was a great suggestion so thank you.\n\nWe then invited my mom to dinner and told her that she has to stop trying to help us with the wedding.\n\nIt started off bad as she brought her binder and had her own wedding dress in her car. Her dress is in very bad condition, would not fit either me or my fianc\u00e9 and is quite frankly hideous. I would never say that to her face, though I've told her every time she's asked that I want to pick out my own dress and she should keep hers for if she wants to get remarried.\n\nShe assumed that we had invited her to apologize and let her plan the wedding however she wanted. How she jumped to that conclusion I have no idea.\n\nWe lied about not wanting her to get overly stressed in the hope she'd take it better then telling her that she's been causing problems and that she hasn't been helpful.\n\nShe didn't take it well and started crying, and saying all she ever wanted was for me to have the perfect wedding and she'd already given up getting the perfect son in law and grandchildren so at the least we could let her plan the wedding. It stunned us both as she has never said a bad word about me liking women, not when I came out, not when I got my first girlfriend, not when me and my fianc\u00e9 got engaged.\n\nThat put me over the edge and I told her that she wasn't going to plan anything, she was a guest and nothing more and I would be cutting her speech if she was going to behave like a child. She had a full on tantrum so me and my fianc\u00e9 paid and left her to cry and scream in the restaurant.\n\nThat was all fine and dandy until our florist called to tell us my mom had called to try and get the flower arrangements changed behind our back. I called her and she tried to lie until she realized she was backed into a corner and admitted to doing it because she knew what was best and was trying to help.\n\nNeedless to say that I've now uninvited her from the wedding with the full support of my fianc\u00e9 and my soon to be MIL and FIL.", "created_utc": 1669592173, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6gfbo/update_aita_for_telling_my_mom_if_she_wants_to/", "score": 4959, "replies": ["Wow!

You reached out, got advice and put it into effect in a fair, reasonable way. Your mom's reaction is not your fault. I physically cringed at that \"I gave up the perfect son in law and grandchildren\" thing, and you handled that perfectly, too. If she wants to make vile, hateful comments and whip up a circus in public (which is a pressure tactic people use when desperate to force their will on someone) the right thing to do is simply refuse to participate in her games. Thumbs up.\n\nBut to be realistic, I doubt this is over since she tried again to meddle with the florist. That goes back to having security at the wedding - the conversation at dinner did not get through to her, and since she continued trying to meddle and is willing to make a scene in public, you do have to be ready for the chance she crashes the wedding to start screaming at the gates to be let in.

Definitely don't agree with how she is going about everything.\nYour mom is projecting her crushed hopes and dreams onto you with this wedding and maybe some underlying resentment about your sexuality(?) I would really hope not for your sake and all that is very sad. She said she wouldn't have grandchildren or a son in law.

OP has stated that the mum fully supported her when she came out and never said anything bad about the fiance. \n\nI think it's rather lazy to assume it is vile, hateful homophobia that she has secretly hidden all these years, rather than just craziness over the wedding day.

I wouldn\u2019t put it past your mom to continue to try to force her wishes, at this point. But that\u2019s from personal experience.\n\nMy friend in university had a similar problem with her future MIL, and when they told her no several times, she had the audacity to try to call the vender and caterers and try to cancel the first and change the food order to her chosen location, along with trying to change the food selection too. It was a nightmare for everyone. She got herself kicked out of the wedding, by trying to damage the bride\u2019s dress on the day of, after showing up post her invite being rescinded. They let her in, not wanting stress/a scene on their day. She said she was sorry, and wanted to help with the set up, general prep. \n\nI was around, because I was a plus one to a friend who\u2019s girlfriend had to cancel last minute. And got a rundown from a friend of the bride, as I volunteered to help with the prep. It was a pretty casual country wedding. The venue was an old barn in the country in autumn. They paid for it l themselves, and did what they could to keep the costs down. \n\nMIL wanted 5 stars, glam, pricy to the max. Her wanted venue was at a ritzy hotel. As I later became friends with the bride and groom, I quickly figured out that MIL\u2019s venue was the exact opposite of both of them. They are both easy going, and wanted their wedding to be fun for them too.\n\nThe bride was suspicious about her sniffing around the changing rooms/prep rooms, and asked a few of general wedding guests to watch her, and a few placed in other areas to keep her out of trouble. My \u2018date\u2019 found her trying to jimmy the locked prep room where the dresses were. The bridal party had gone to grab a quick snack before makeup and changing. There was a mass blowup between her and her son. At some point he grabbed her purse out of her hands, and dumped it on the table. There were kitchen scissors. We all knew what she had been planning. They still don\u2019t speak to her to this day, and this was 15 years ago, and 3 kids later, now. \n\nI did read your original post, but didn\u2019t comment as it seemed like others had said it for me.
