My mom is putting me on her insurance provided by her work, but it\u2019s with a different provider than I had (I had Kaiser.) the thing is I have documentation that my dad signed where he agreed to provide my insurance until I am 18 and whatnot. That document is the same in two states, (I live in one with my mom, the other my dad lives in but is pretty close to me.) I confronted him when it first happened but his excuse was it was \u201conly $80 for my insurance but an extra $400 to pay for yours\u201d even though he lives with his parents, doesn\u2019t pay rent, and almost IMMEDIATELY AFTER cancelling my insurance he bought a new tv and modded his car. Would I be the AH if I told him he needs to put me back on it or I will take action?\n\nEdit: Ty all who gave advice, it helps more than you think! I don\u2019t appreciate the comments telling me to stay in my lane and let it be, I have done that long enough and now his bs is affecting my health so I am wanting to do something about it and remind him that he has gone too far.

I am well aware it is between them legally but it is also about my health and how I am sick of my dad being a dick thinking he can get away with this shit. I know how it works well enough to know that he legally can not do that, I can not sue until 18, but I can aide my mother in making a case and help find a good lawyer. My dad is neglecting my health, yes. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to sit here and let him push us around. I can\u2019t do anything on my own legally but that doesn\u2019t mean I can not remind him of what he signed, remind him that mom and I have the documents to prove it, and tell him to get his shit together and fix it or mom and I can and will take legal action. I\u2019m old enough to make my own choices and my choice is to 1, not let people like you giving me attitude when I am seeking advice and not seeking for people to give me shit. And 2, not let my sorry excuse of a father to get away with this shit any more than he has. So I would appreciate it if you wouldn\u2019t say shit like \u201cstay in your lane\u201d and not remind me of basic facts about how it is legally between them instead of acknowledging that I am trying to figure out how to go about it :)"]}
