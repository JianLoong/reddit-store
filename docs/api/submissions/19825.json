You can tell a kid 1000 times \u201cno, it\u2019s hot\u201d when they grab for your coffee/try to touch the stove/etc. but it will mean nothing to them, if anything, they may want more because they want to test boundaries.

I get that your risk tolerance is different than theirs, but they are the parents. My older brother had kids 9 years before I had my first. I parent much differently than he did and that\u2019s ok. He and his wife were very much less risk averse in terms of falls/kids learning on their own than I am and part of that was because I watched them hover over their daughters and the kid would seemingly be fine until the mom gasped loudly and ran straight to the kid asking how hurt she was and then the kid would cry. My husband and I wait to see the child\u2019s reaction before we react and oddly enough, most of the time the kid is more startled than hurt and my kids learned physical boundaries a bit earlier than my nieces. Again, it\u2019s parenting preference. Neither way was wrong. \n\nBut I said YTA because your sentence \u2018fine watch your own kid, I\u2019m done\u2019 implies you thought they were relying on you to hover over their kid but nowhere do you state that they asked you to do this or expected it of you.

If I\u2019m unloading groceries, taking trashes out and down, turning sprinklers on/off or grabbing the mail. Sometimes they come along with me for three tasks and sometimes not. I would get nothing done if I was constantly hovering over my kids. Kids are much more capable than you\u2019re giving credit for. My almost 2 year old sits in a regular chair to eat. He can walk up and down the stairs on his own with me holding his hand, I don\u2019t let him do it alone and there\u2019s gates on the top and bottom of the stairs. \n\nIf you put a kid in a bubble, and are constantly hovering, you\u2019re giving them anxiety about unnecessary tasks and not allowing them proper development. My 3 almost 4 year old makes her own sandwiches. She plays in her room alone. She can get herself water and uses the toilet all on her own. Kids are capable if you allow them to explore and teach them.", "No they definitely won\u2019t - because i am free child care. I have been since birth. I appreciate you for understanding the situation without me having to entirely spell it out. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a perfect parent situation and I get that I didn\u2019t mention that - but I\u2019m wildly confused why so many would assume that and go off on me with that assumption.", "That's the best answer, and a good point about risk.  You're not wrong to keep an eye on the kid, but turn down the volume.  Aim for situational awareness, not 'watch your damn kid!'", "Your sister and her husband know their son, they know what he is capable of and what he needs assistance on. By three most kids are very proficient with stairs, climbing, getting off and on seats etc. so walking away while he is on 3/4 steps isn\u2019t a big deal. Also a chair isn\u2019t a big deal, he could get off himself and go after them when needed. Yta softly because you are concerned out of care but over reacting.", "You're welcome!", "I think it's really sweet how you care about your nephew but if they told you to chill out then you need to do that OP, take it easy, if you know they're good parents and not doing something obviously bad then take it easy! Soft YTA.", "I can see your POV where you\u2019re saying that it comes from a place of concern and anxiousness. I just want to give you a different perspective. If my husband and I were at a family gathering/event and someone unbidden kept hovering over my child and insinuating that they knew how to risk-assess my son better than I could, I would feel very much like it was a \u201cgotcha\u201d maneuver or savior complex. Take it with a grain of salt, but this would be my perspective as the mother in the scenario.", "My son is one and can get in and out of chairs on his own. How are they supposed to learn if you're just standing there staring at them? Being that overreactive is only going to make the kid freak out and not want to try and do anything in fear of you telling them no or stopping them.", "A 3 year old can be in a chair by themselves. They won\u2019t die. \n\nYou\u2019re crazy overprotective. It\u2019s strange.", "No, there is not genuine concern with a three year old sitting on a CHAIR. How high up is this chair? If it\u2019s a normal sized chair, I\u2019m sorry but response was WAY over the top. A two year old can get up and down from a chair, I\u2019m sure a three year old will be just fine lol. \nSource: mother of two children", "No there\u2019s not.  My kids aren\u2019t even 2 yet and get in and out of chairs and the bed themselves", "then personally, I feel like it's not your responsibility to watch him. that's on his parents. and also, a part of growing up is getting \"hurt\" (not injured) and having accidents or mistakes and learning from them. as long as there's no serious bodily harm, then let the kid be a kid. just my two cents.", "Wait, the kid has lived in a house with stairs for three years and has NEVER used them\u2026.? Or were they at your home? If it\u2019s their house, I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m sure the kid goes on the stairs and sits on chairs all the time when you\u2019re not there.", "How do you think he's going to learn how to do stairs by himself?  By doing the stairs by himself.", "And he never will do stairs by himself until you let him.", "There\u2019s gotta be a first time for everythinf", "Truth hurts", "Lol?", "Welcome to reddit lol. You post for one thing and receive answers about everything else. That's normal.\n\nFor a short answer to your real question: YTA. Not your kid, not your responsibility. Unless they are actively abusing the child, butt out. And no, this isn't abuse or neglect.", "I think it\u2019s because he just turned 3 like last week so I keep thinking of him as 2", "My sister (no kids) is more cautious like this with my kid than I am, and I think it comes from the absolute dread of being responsible for harm befalling someone else's child. I see my kid every day, I know pretty well what she can safely do. My sister doesn't feel that confident, so the rules are different. That's fine with me; what would not be ok with me, and what happened here, was OP wasn't asked to watch the kid. The parents were on site, they knew what he was up to and deemed it acceptable. You're not the only one who is more protective of their nibling than parents are, and I think it's the fact that you took on the mantle of responsibility without communication and doled out judgement that makes YTA. Not a huge unreasonable A, just for what you said.", "https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/blog/concussion-prevention-recognition-in-little-ones/#:~:text=Common%20Causes%20of%20Concussion%20in,Fall%20with%20a%20fast%20speed.\n\nFalls onto a hard surface can cause a concussion. I'd put a rug at the bottom of the steps. Everything is fine until one time it isn't. \n\nI don't think you need to \"hover\"; just keep the kid away from the stairs and top heavy furniture if you have that.", "You\u2019d leave your toddler home alone unsupervised while you\u2019re outside??? I don\u2019t get it, genuinely. Even if you had the most trust that they\u2019d just sit there watching cocomelon.", "No - but question. Would you go outside and do yard work while your 3 year old is in the house?\n\nPopping out for a question is one thing - but I think being out in the yard while your toddler is inside alone is a bit different?\n\nAnd I could be wrong! I am actually willing to accept that. But it doesn\u2019t feel that way.", "Reread the final paragraph. I never changed the story.", "It might be poorly worded but I said they went outside leaving him in a chair. Meaning they were outside of the home in the yard and he was sitting in a chair inside the home.", "I think that is the factor that the OP is ignoring and what makes them in the wrong\u2026 the parents know their own kid AND get to make the decision about risk tolerance.  \n\nBy hovering and acting like the parents are neglecting their kid, the OP is negating the parents entirely. This would insult me on a VERY deep level. No parent wants to be accused of neglect or abuse, especially when the are allowing their child calculated risks. These risks are what let\u2019s kids grow. This is a good parent and a bad aunt.", "Is it? I always assumed you shouldn\u2019t leave a toddler alone in a room unsupervised - I guess I was wrong.", "How do you think parents take a shower?", "Yes absolutely. I'm.not going to fight with a kicking and screaming 2.5yr old to put shoes on just so I can wheel a 1yr old and my pregnant self over to the chook coop to feed and water chooks. Just to have her storm off across a field back to the house all by herself while I'm knee deep in chickens.\n\nShe knows how to walk to the patio and call me. My house is appropriately child safe. Turns out she wanted to tell me she saw a dog on TV. Then went back inside. \n\nThe biggest danger was crayons. I've had to hide them. The walls....the walls are not a canvas. \n\nToddlers know and understand so much more than we give them credit for sometimes. They just don't have the same level of verbal skills we adults have. \n\nTry sitting sown and talking with both the parents and the kid. I think you'll be very surprised the level of understanding and development this little human has. He knows what's going on around him.", "No it\u2019s just not clear the kid was left alone in the house with NO adults at all.", "I cannot WAIT til you have kids \ud83d\ude02 what\u2019s the right age to leave a child in a chair?", "Oh my gosh. Never leaving a toddler alone? Ever? Because that\u2019s totally realistic for parents. /s \n\nThis is the problem with people who don\u2019t have children but think they know everything about parenting. Stay in your lane.", "Carefully and quickly? And by putting on the tv or giving them some sort of distraction?", "Added an edit that\u2019s my bad - I thought it was clear but clearly I messed up lol", "21 in the USA or 18 in Australia, I mean obviously you have to wait till they're legally an adult.\n\nGeez, my 2yr old won't even let me help her get on and off of chairs anymore. I like to poop in peace sometimes too...and even *gasp* ...... lock the bathroom door. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on where the 1yr gets to while I'm showering \ud83e\udd23 .", "I think if you\u2019re leaving your 2/3 year old unattended in a room for over 5 minutes while you\u2019re outside\u2026. You should really take a parenting class.", "See, most people don't have a TV in the bathroom, where they tend to shower. So I guess, parents have to leave toddlers alone once in a while.", "Do you think it's neglect? They knew you were in the house, did they assume you were watching him? If you think they are neglecting the kid do something. Maybe I watch too much YT but horrific things have happened to children of neglectful parents because no one around them spoke up. \n\nAt first glance it seemed like you were for sure being ridiculous but I've read all of your comments and you are very passionate and defensive about this and it makes me think this is a really big issue. Otherwise you'd just agree with people and laugh and how silly you were being. Luckily you've been there, what happens when they leave the kid alone in the house when you aren't there? Assuming all your replies are genuine, it sounds like these people need a wake up call.", "I'm just imagining forcing my 10yo or 7yo twins to follow me around all day because they can't be alone now, thanks for that \ud83e\udd23\n\nThey do all attempt to be in the room while I'm showering though,  thank God for locks.", "I think you are the one who needs to take classes. Helicopter parenting is not good for the kids.", "Lol. How do you think single parents shower? Poop?", "Ever heard of people going to the bathroom and leaving their toddler by themselves? I had 3 toddlers of my own and have watched two of my grandkids since birth. Did it with all of them. My kids are grown up and healthy productive people and grandkids are growing fine as well. It's not bad parenting", "Have a kid, then you can have an opinion", "Yeah. But you\u2019re still inside of the home with them. You can hop out of the shower if you hear screaming.", "Genuinely - is not wanting to leave a child unattended inside a home helicopter parenting. If it is I\u2019ll look it up and learn more. But I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s so unreasonable", "You\u2019re still in the house with them? That\u2019s different", "You understand that it's already happened once they scream, right?", "Just like they can walk back inside if they hear screaming\u2026.", "What do you mean by unattended? are the parents leaving the property?", "You need therapy for your anxiety.", "How, though? You can\u2019t exactly get up mid-poop", "It's literally not any different. If you're within a few meters of your kid, it doesn't matter whether you're physically under the same roof. A toddler can absolutely be left alone in the next room or whatever for 10 minutes, whether the parent is in the bathroom or in the front yard.", "I added clarification. They were outside of the house in the yard. I was leaving the house too because I needed to get back to my office. But no one else was around inside to watch my nephew.", "Uh. If I heard him crying I\u2019d be up so fast so yeah. You can."]}
