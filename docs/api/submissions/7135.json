Maybe live with his in laws? But he said he can't for multiple reasons.\n\nI talked to my kids to see if we can find a solution.

It's not about the fact that you won't kick the others out. It's that you let your youngest stay when you kicked the older two out, then claim its \"different\" now to justify yourself. Then you let your oldest come back with his whole family when he needed help, and it sounds like you went to some effort to accommodate them.\n\nThen comes your middle child, who needs help and turned to their parent just like he's seen his older and younger brother do.

That your home is not open to him and his family can't be accommodated because his brothers are there.\n\nHow is he supposed to feel? How do you justify treating Josh the way you do?

Put them all in a room together and no one gets to leave unless it all gets sorted out that they're staying or leaving. \n\nI also don't understand why you would ask a teenage girl to share with her aunt? Why the heck can't a husband and wife share wherever they are? There's nothing wrong with two of your sons and your daughter in law in the same room?\n\nOr even, in the worst case, putting up a divider in the living room and behind that is their \"bed\", couch or air mattress.

He's the last person to come back into the house; he gets the least say.", "Question - it\u2019s a small house, why does Alana get veto over sharing a room? NTA - your house you get to decide if Paula stays. But have you sat down and explained to the two older kids why Paul is getting held to such a different standard than they were? Because I\u2019m sure to them it looks like favoritism. I\u2019m not suggesting you kick Paul out, but you didn\u2019t just not kick him out at 18 - you let him stay 5 years past that day. If my mother had made that big a difficult I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be resentful.", "NTA. Sometimes you just don't have the ability to help. It's a tough situation, but you can barely house the people who already live with you. \n\nYour son is scared and desperate.

That's rich coming from a guy who showed his first two the door promptly at 18. \nThe widowed son has now had 8 years to reconfigure his household- should've been gone 6 years ago easily.  Are you going to toss the grandkids at 18?  Seems only fair,  using your logic.\nYTA", "NTA \n\nYou acknowledge you treated the older ones different. \n\nYou allowed Mike and his two kids back in. So 5 adults in a house!\n\nNow Joey wants to move 3 more adults into the house and they don\u2019t fit! \n\nThis isn\u2019t about not wanting to help Joey, it\u2019s that the timing sucks and Joey and his family doesn\u2019t fit! \n\nLife often isn\u2019t fair and timing is all important", "I don't understand why everyone is so mad. They have been living with OP for 8 years. It's their home as well. Usually you don't evict paying people for ones with no job...\n\nQuestion:  if there are some willing to double up how is there  no possible way to accommodate the married couple? Or let them both sleep in the living room. Maybe pull a trailer in the yard or pitch a tent?\n\nBut I think NTA, it's your house and you already have roommates. Probably if you never brought the part about kicking the older ones out at 18 no one would have said anything.", "NTA  Kids aren't entitled to the exact same upbringing, especially when they are 20 years apart.  \n\nIt's unfortunate that Josh is struggling but the bottom line is you don't have the space.  And you tried re-working things to make space, but that wasn't good enough.   Asking someone to move out because he feels entitled to his desired setup in a house he isn't planning on contributing to is ridiculous.\n\nAlso, that many people in a house isn't going to make anyone happy.", "NTA. Bottom line - your house.", "NTA, I have no idea why everyone is asking why your youngest is still living at home, even if he wasn't there still wouldn't be enough room so it's a moot point, claiming favouritism is also bs because the eldest was kicked out at 18 too. \n\nAlso, I'm failing to see why this can't work, why is the only possible way of this working if the wife and the eldest daughter share a room? I can think of multiple possible ways to make this work. \n\nAgain I don't think YTA but there is ways to solve this if you do want to get your Middle son's family into the house.\n\nPossible ways to make this work would be:\n\nOP + eldest \nMiddle + wife\nYoungest\nEldest son and middle son\nEldest daughter. \n\nOr\n\nOP + youngest\nMiddle + wife\nEldest \nEldest son and Middle son\nEldest daughter\n\nOr \n\nOP\nEldest + youngest\nMiddle + wife\nEldest son and Middle son\nEldest daughter", "NTA - you help when you have capacity to, that is completely fine.  But how about Rose gets a job..?", "ESH but overall you are NTA.\n\nThere's a big age difference between the first two kids and the youngest and things change. The fact that Paul is still at home at 23 is neither here nor there v's the fact that the others left at 18.  The world is different now and a lot more expensive.\n\nHowever Mike is taking the piss here..  There is nothing stopping him from moving out.  A few years ago he probably did need some care for the kids as they were a lot younger but they are now 16 and 17 and fine to be on their own for a few hours.  Surely Mike has been able to save some money and it's time for him to move out with his kids.  So if Alana and Joey want their own rooms, their dad needs to provide that.  This is your home and your rules.  Yes they live there but they are only there because you allow it.\n\nI can completely see why Josh is upset.  Your first suggestion about staying with the inlaws was reasonable but that's not a possibility.\n\nDo Mike and Paul pay rent?  If not, then perhaps it's time to start charging them market rent.  Then with the rent that Mike and Paul pay (and you might need to contribute some), Josh will be able to stay in his current house (or downsize to something a little cheaper).  That's another potential thing to throw into the mix.\n\nSo the choice is people bunk up (Alana being a 16 year old girl gets to keep her own room) and everyone lives with you or they pay rent that goes to Josh so that Josh can afford to pay for a home.", "NTA, I find this situation odd. But demanding any person be allowed to move into your already full home is entitled. And then it gets worse when they don't like the arrangements. And then demanding that other people lose their home for that is completely nuts. \n\nPresumably they are moving in because of the harsh economic conditions. Why do they think their little brother with two decades less of experience would have it easier than them?", "NTA,  because Josh didn't like your terms of his wife sleeping on the couch. What I'm not understanding is why can't Mike move into the basement with his kids? The teen boys could share a space and perhaps a sleeper sofa is an option for Paul? I'm also assuming Josh and his wife aren't expecting to live with you long term. Is there a garage space that could be converted as well?", "Wait, lemme get this clear like mud... you said yes after discussing with the household, on the proviso that Josh's daughter is on the couch, as you wanted to accommodate all you could within reason. \n\nTell your son to get a grip on reality, regardless of whether you might have been overly strict when he was young. Displacing others for his own benefit is selfish as hell. \n\nOh, yeah, NTA, but Josh...", "You should have just put this situation on the 3 siblings to figure out and stepped out of it.
