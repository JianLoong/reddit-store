I had dreamed of spending holidays and vacations with my son's kids. I was upset he told us over a zoom call, and they had a dinner with DIL's family the next day to tell them. I told my son that it hurt that I didn't get told in person and get to give him a hug. I tried to keep the news to myself but in my excitement I did share with some family. \n\nson said he did not want me to share what he told me about DIL's health and I explained that family supports you and should know. I woke up one day to a text with pictures of the newborn saying he wanted to tell me first (proud moment) and to call him. I sent a message to the family letting them know that everyone was healthy and baby was here, then called. I tried to check in several times in the hospital because I was so excited that I had a newborn grandson and was desperate for pictures. He did not respond quickly (if at all). \n\nMy wife had a meal for their freezer. they told us we could come two days after they went home bc we had traveled and needed to quarantine. We were in town so I brought the food and asked if we could come by. Son said no. I drove by their house and her sister was there so it's not like they weren't having company, just not us. I said some unkind things in anger and hurt feelings to son about how he was a disappointment and was turning his back on me, later apologized. \n\nWe tried to get together on holidays and were rejected. We were told to ask before we could see our grandson but they always had plans. How can new parents have THAT many plans? when we found out that they were expecting their second (in person this time, an improvement) I told my son that I didn't want this one to go the way the other had and he told me that was up to me. \n\nI kept trying and he seemed to open up more, but anytime I would ask for one on one time with my grandson I was shot down. I was told that I needed to improve the relationship with son and DIL before I'd be allowed around grandson without them. I told son I was willing whenever she was. I invited him to an event a month before baby, he said yes and then cancelled. I got upset and told him that he didn't feel like my son. He reached out to wife a month later saying that baby had been born a WEEK earlier and that she could come but not me. She refused to go with out me so he came around and invited us both when the baby was 4 mo. I tried to be on best behavior and sat out of the way and keep my mouth shut. They told us that we weren't welcome back because I was cold and they didn't want their kids to think it's ok to be like that. He says I \"disowned\" him and that's why I wasn't invited with his mother.\n\nI know I have made some mistakes, but I really don't think I'm the AH here.

That you were hurt because you only got a zoom call and her family is in person. That kind of score keeping is exhausting for everyone and tinges every interaction with a sense of walking on eggshells. And then you tell your son he\u2019s a disappointment. How the F is he supposed to treat you? So you apologized. BFD. How about expecting your son to treat you like shit for a few years so you can be prepared for the unfair (in your eyes) rejections that you\u2019re sure to experience. You F\u2019d up.

It sounds like you're leaving out a lot of context of your relationship with your son, but nothing you've said paints you in a good light. You have repeatedly stomped on their boundaries and demanded their time and attention. You don't care about what they want, you just want to force them to do things on your terms. That's not how you build or repair a relationship. \n\n>I think they are trying to control everything and not giving me any slack for being an excited first time granddad\n\nThey're the parents. They have every right to control this situation, and you don't deserve any slack for ignoring their wishes behind the excuse of being \"excited\". You're not entitled to time with your children or your grandkids, you have to earn that. And so far all you've done is shown them you can't be trusted to follow their very simple and clear boundaries. \n\nIf you want to try to salvage things, reach out with a *genuine* apology.

After all of that, they don't trust you.  You had opportunities to try to repair this relationship and didn't do it because you focused instead on how they treated you instead of even acknowledging that you did anything wrong.\n\nAnd then with the second baby, you sat there and pouted.  When are you going to take responsibility for your actions?  If you want to have any relationship with your son and his family, you need to talk to them.  Apologize, do NOT use the word \"but\" or try any of the shitty \"I'm sorry you felt that way\" apologies.  Ask them if you can please be part of their lives, and how you can do that in a way that they are comfortable with.  Promise to respect their boundaries going forward.  **Be accountable and understand that YOU fucked this up.  Nobody else.**\n\nAnd btw, many new moms want their family around them when they give birth and while recovering.  THEIR family.  Not their husband's family.

And even if they choose to tell you something, that does not mean they consent to you sharing that information with others.", "You could have contained it. You chose not to.", "But then why can't her parents take priority for her?", "Reread my comment slowly.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about who gets priority.\n\nI am saying that when you tell Aunt Sally that DIL is pregnant, that means your son and Aunt Sally no longer get their special moment.", "Would you have rather he was totally honest and said 'Dad, we're only accepting visits from people that my wife feels comfortable with and close to and you're not one of those people so please don't come'?\n\nYour son is trying to be tactful and spare your feelings, you're trying to find ways to force him into behaving how you think is right and honestly, you can go ahead with it but it won't make him or his wife want to let you around their kids because you're showing that he can't trust you.", "He wanted y\u2019all to wait because you are from out of town and they have a new born baby. You could be sick or have covid. It\u2019s perfectly normal to ask you to quarantine and wait. The sister may be from the same city or already quarantined . The fact you don\u2019t understand why that is important shows it\u2019s all about you and not the health of the baby!", ">they told us we could come two days after they went home bc we had traveled and needed to quarantine.\n\n>He said we could come two days after they got home because we had traveled and they wanted some time alone.\n\nWhat were you saying about lies?", ">I don't normally drive by though, that's the only time that we have driven by that we weren't dropping something off.\n\nWhen you drop something off do you ask when is a good time or do you go around unannounced?", "Her sister may have actually been helpful.  Also, maybe she wanted her sister seeing her bleeding out of her vagina and her leaking boobs, something you don't usually want your FIL to see", "Weren\u2019t you supposed to wait a couple days because you were away and they wanted you to quarantine? But you went anyway.", "> regret it, it did let me know that he was telling a lie about wanting to be alone since her sister was there.  I don't normally drive by though, that's the only time that we have driven by that we weren't dropping something off.\n\nDo you even have any Concept of what it is to be a new mother?  You are upset because her sister is there, most probably HELPING her during her recovery, but you get upset because they don't want to ENTERTAIN?\n\nYou are either purposely being obtuse or are truly a clueless, selfish person.  New parents are ALLOWED to take time before entertaining.  Sheesh. \n\nYou sound exhausting, and I recommend you really do some soul searching and begin to respect your son and his wife, because if you don't start really understanding THEY are the parents and are the decision makers, you will NOT have a relationship with your grandchildren.\n\nYour wife better get her head out of her rear also, because by supporting your idiotic behavior, she will not know her grandchildren either.", "He is allowed to say no. Learn that he is a person with his own family, his life does not revolve around you anymore.

You need to find a professional counselor\u2014a psychologist or a licensed clinical social worker or a marriage and family counselor. You need to get into therapy to understand why you are doing the things you are doing. This is not about communication between two people, as would be addressed in family therapy. This is about you and your belief that you should run the show and your willingness to stomp on other people's boundaries.\n\nYou said that you were working on your anger issues. But if you aren't being seen by a therapist for those issues, and if you haven't talked to a psychiatrist about a medication like Lamictal, you aren't really working on it. You're giving it lip service. And that means that you're using it as an excuse for your bad behavior. Working on it means actually trying to change things.

That's private information on a need to know basis. The need to know is your son and DIL. Honestly, I find it a little weird and creepy that you all are speculating and commenting on their intimate life. They're not objects or something for you all to control. Speculation, gossip, and control seems to a problem.  I stand by saying, you need to back off, get some anger management or go to therapy, and respect their boundaries.", "You haven't *earned* being even with her parents. Her parents *earned* their privileges by being respectful and helpful. They have been rewarded for being loving and appropriate. If you'd like to enjoy the privileges they do, you'll need to engage in behavior equal to theirs.", "So you expected them to travel to you in the middle of a pandemic, risking everyone\u2019s health, just so you could feel special?", "You\u2019re really not doing a very good job on the \u201cstop keeping count\u201d thing are you?", "But then thats between you and your son - you keep blaming your daughter in law but she isn't the one responsible for dealing with you or telling you big news - that's your sons role. \n\nNow, you might say 'well exactly, and he didn't do that properly/fairly'. But by your own admission, you have a short temper and have said horrible things to him in the past. Of course he keeps you at arms length and doesn't want to let you in too close. \n\nHave you considered they are closer to his wife's family because they have a better relationship with them? Because his wife's family are kind and don't say nasty things or call them disappointments or say they'll disown them? If your son has experienced your temper on a regular basis before, then of course he will avoid you or spend less time with you.\n\nIn another comment, you talked about actions have consequences. Well here are the consequences of YOUR actions. Your short temper, your cruel words, have led to this point and the consequences are that your son wants limited contact with you. People don't want to be around angry, nasty people and unfortunately, you have been angry and nasty on multiple occasions by your own admission. So stop blaming others and start recognising that if you had been a kinder person in the past, you wouldn't be at this point now. \n\nYou said terrible things to your son after the birth of his first child and you chalk it up to you having a temper. Have you actually considered how much that must have hurt your son? Have you apologised properly, recognised his hurt, acknowledged that was a terrible thing to do when he was vulnerable? Or did you just say something like 'sorry, you know I have a temper and say things I don't mean.' Because the latter isn't an apology, its a lame excuse. \n\nYou really lack insight into your own actions. Another point I'd make - your son and DIL probably don't want you to spend one on one time with their kids because of your temper. You've shown repeatedly that if you lose your temper, you will say awful things - why on earth would they risk you losing your temper with their children and saying hurtful things ?", "No.  It those are also old feelings. I\u2019m trying to do better going forward. It\u2019s really hard when they get to live the life I\u2019ve dreamed of and feel like I\u2019ve earned with my grandkids."]}
