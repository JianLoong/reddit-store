I had dreamed of spending holidays and vacations with my son's kids. I was upset he told us over a zoom call, and they had a dinner with DIL's family the next day to tell them. I told my son that it hurt that I didn't get told in person and get to give him a hug. I tried to keep the news to myself but in my excitement I did share with some family. \n\nson said he did not want me to share what he told me about DIL's health and I explained that family supports you and should know. I woke up one day to a text with pictures of the newborn saying he wanted to tell me first (proud moment) and to call him. I sent a message to the family letting them know that everyone was healthy and baby was here, then called. I tried to check in several times in the hospital because I was so excited that I had a newborn grandson and was desperate for pictures. He did not respond quickly (if at all). \n\nMy wife had a meal for their freezer. they told us we could come two days after they went home bc we had traveled and needed to quarantine. We were in town so I brought the food and asked if we could come by. Son said no. I drove by their house and her sister was there so it's not like they weren't having company, just not us. I said some unkind things in anger and hurt feelings to son about how he was a disappointment and was turning his back on me, later apologized. \n\nWe tried to get together on holidays and were rejected. We were told to ask before we could see our grandson but they always had plans. How can new parents have THAT many plans? when we found out that they were expecting their second (in person this time, an improvement) I told my son that I didn't want this one to go the way the other had and he told me that was up to me. \n\nI kept trying and he seemed to open up more, but anytime I would ask for one on one time with my grandson I was shot down. I was told that I needed to improve the relationship with son and DIL before I'd be allowed around grandson without them. I told son I was willing whenever she was. I invited him to an event a month before baby, he said yes and then cancelled. I got upset and told him that he didn't feel like my son. He reached out to wife a month later saying that baby had been born a WEEK earlier and that she could come but not me. She refused to go with out me so he came around and invited us both when the baby was 4 mo. I tried to be on best behavior and sat out of the way and keep my mouth shut. They told us that we weren't welcome back because I was cold and they didn't want their kids to think it's ok to be like that. He says I \"disowned\" him and that's why I wasn't invited with his mother.\n\nI know I have made some mistakes, but I really don't think I'm the AH here.

That you were hurt because you only got a zoom call and her family is in person. That kind of score keeping is exhausting for everyone and tinges every interaction with a sense of walking on eggshells. And then you tell your son he\u2019s a disappointment. How the F is he supposed to treat you? So you apologized. BFD. How about expecting your son to treat you like shit for a few years so you can be prepared for the unfair (in your eyes) rejections that you\u2019re sure to experience. You F\u2019d up.

It sounds like you're leaving out a lot of context of your relationship with your son, but nothing you've said paints you in a good light. You have repeatedly stomped on their boundaries and demanded their time and attention. You don't care about what they want, you just want to force them to do things on your terms. That's not how you build or repair a relationship. \n\n>I think they are trying to control everything and not giving me any slack for being an excited first time granddad\n\nThey're the parents. They have every right to control this situation, and you don't deserve any slack for ignoring their wishes behind the excuse of being \"excited\". You're not entitled to time with your children or your grandkids, you have to earn that. And so far all you've done is shown them you can't be trusted to follow their very simple and clear boundaries. \n\nIf you want to try to salvage things, reach out with a *genuine* apology.

After all of that, they don't trust you.  You had opportunities to try to repair this relationship and didn't do it because you focused instead on how they treated you instead of even acknowledging that you did anything wrong.\n\nAnd then with the second baby, you sat there and pouted.  When are you going to take responsibility for your actions?  If you want to have any relationship with your son and his family, you need to talk to them.  Apologize, do NOT use the word \"but\" or try any of the shitty \"I'm sorry you felt that way\" apologies.  Ask them if you can please be part of their lives, and how you can do that in a way that they are comfortable with.  Promise to respect their boundaries going forward.  **Be accountable and understand that YOU fucked this up.  Nobody else.**\n\nAnd btw, many new moms want their family around them when they give birth and while recovering.  THEIR family.  Not their husband's family.

This guy does not view you as his father, I bet he has absolute contempt for you, and I bet a big part of that is the anger you admit you have a problem with.", "Until you treat your son and dil with respect, you don't deserve respect from them. Being his dad doesn't automatically make you anything but the person who contributed DNA. You have huge boundary issues and are behaving as though your son is both an extension of your person and someone who owes you a debt. You choose to father a child and raised him to adulthood. He doesn't owe you shit for that.", "If you don\u2019t check that attitude STAT, your son/DIL will go NC with you. That doesn\u2019t fly now.", "You're making up arbitrary rules because you want to be the center of the universe. News flash: you're not.", "No, you shouldn't.   You lost that consideration with all your boundary stomping.  Your disrespect towards your son's wishes dropped any priority you may have enjoyed to a very far back burner.", "you are his extended family now. his priority is his wife and kids cos they are his family now. whether you see her as family or not is up to you but then dont cry cos they exclude you", "Seems like he is having trouble *wanting* to build a relationship with you then. Stop making it harder for him when he is literally *telling* you what he wants you to do.\n\nYou can't ignore instructions like that and wonder why people get annoyed. When you are holding the flashlight for the guy fixing your car, you point it where he tells you to, even if you don't think it's best.\n\nYou want a role in your grandkids life?\n\nLet *their father* lead.", "Maybe she's more comfortable with her sister seeing her shirtless while her nipples bleed than she is with you doing the same. Ever think about that?", "Here\u2019s the thing. Your son has explained the issue to you. You just don\u2019t like his answers. He has zero obligation to keep explaining it until you understand their boundaries and, frankly, you aren\u2019t entitled to understand them. You aren\u2019t required to agree with them. But if you want a relationship with your son and grandchildren  \u2014 because we can all tell that you are blaming your DIL for this entire situation and I suspect you have already burned that bridge to the ground- you are required to abide by their boundaries. \n\nCan you do that or not? That\u2019s the only question.", "It's all so restricted because you have shown, repeatedly, that if you're given an inch, you'll take a mile, and demand another one on top. And so now your son doesn't trust you to respect any boundaries but the very harshest and prickliest ones.", "I suspect they \u2014 your DIL especially \u2014 are unimpressed with all your \u201ctrying\u201d. You really shouldn\u2019t need to \u201ctry\u201d managing your temper and respecting their privacy and boundaries. (If my FIL divulged my medical information to extended family and friends without my permission, it would be a **very** long time before I spoke to him.)", "My dad was once an extremely excited first time grandfather but he didn\u2019t behave like you.\n\nSorry to be blunt, but there are restrictions because they don\u2019t particularly like you and they don\u2019t want the relationship with you that you would like to have with them. You overstep boundaries, you are over bearing, you have a bad temper. They choose not to spend time with you. They choose not to frequently expose themselves and their children to you.\n\nYTA. And you also seem to be wilfully obtuse. Do better.", "Maybe its so restricted because you repeatedly \"get upset\" and say hurtful and insulting things to your son and his wife?    If you want to see the baby more then maybe quit acting like one, you're a grown man get a grip on your emotions and quit throwing tantrums", "They don't owe you an explanation.", "Every single comment is telling you why they have made these decisions", "your son and dil can explain all they want, but they can\u2019t *make you understand* that is reliant on you.", "You do not need to understand something in order to respect it. It's not about you. It's about them. They get to make these decisions regardless of how you feel about it.", "Yes they can be important, but plenty of people get through without grandparents so it's not a requirement.", "This explains so much about your behaviour, and not in a good way.", "You are religious. That doesn't mean your children are. Religious \"therapists\" have an agenda. You need someone completely neutral to actually get anything worthwhile done.", "It\u2019s funny how religious families are often the most dysfunctional. What was it that Christ said about keeping score and making sure no one gets more than you do\u2026? I forget.", "You're only grasping at family therapy to force them to spend time with you instead of focusing on self-reflection and self-improvement.", "You are religious because it benefits your self-centered, patriarchal mindset. You do not need more religion enabling you. You need to be challenged to grow as a person.", "Knocking? OP is ramming head first into that door.", "This was me misspeaking. I told my wife to apologize to DIL and son for speaking about them trying to get pregnant to my sons grandparents. Just typed it wrong so that it was confusing.", "Also, what new parents want multiple visitors at once?\nIf they're trying to control how many people are over at a time, it sure doesn't sound like OP would be okay hearing 'We're letting other people visit today and you will have to wait two days for your turn'", "Yep, even in his own retelling he is telling on himself. He is twisting this as they are being singled out when in fact they weren't allowed to visit until it was safer for the newborn due to covid.... All they had to do was wait a few days.", "How so? Why is religious bad?", "You're digging yourself deeper. Just shut up", "YTA - this  is not something I would expect someone to cause drama over.  You don\u2019t live nearby so they told you over Zoom.  It seems like you go out of your way to find reasons to be upset and resentful.  \n\nYou are making your life so much harder than it needs to be  and destroying your relationship with your son.", "You are not equal because they obviously have a better relationship with them.", "YTA. Your son is his own person, with his own thoughts, feelings, wants and desires. He is not merely an extension of you and your will. \n\nHis core family is now his wife and new baby. Not you. You\u2019re acting extremely entitled. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve earned\u201d \n\u201cI deserve\u201d \n\u201cI want\u201d\n\nA lot of \u201cme ne me\u201d going on. None of it matters. Because it\u2019s not what your SON and HIS WIFE want. And when it comes to THEIR nuclear family, that\u2019s all that matters. \n\nBe warned that this blatant disregard and disrespect of your son as his own individual person who makes decision for his family will eventually lead them to go low to no contact with unit if you don\u2019t reign in your entitlement.", "> was hurt that they told us over a zoom call and them in person.\n\nconsidering the timeline that you've been super vague about and the mention of needing to quarantine after travel, could the zoom call have been because of... i don't know... some worldwide health emergency that curtailed your ability to be there in person?", "Her parents have respected her wishes. You have specifically stomped all over your son's wishes so you could be the center of attention. If you want to be treated respectfully, then you need to act respectful.", "You aren't as important.  You cannot be trusted.", "You really can't see that you're doing it on your timetable without checking if it's okay with your son, can you? And you'll think \"but I'm being helpful/kind/generous by dropping this off, I'm doing them a favour\".", "Religious = using guilt and fear to control", "Religious family counseling tends to be rooted in the hierarchy of god is first, and the man of the house is second and everyone else comes next. \n\nit tends to produce people who think like you do...\n\nyour son and DIL probably believe in an equal partnership, not a hierarchy. \n\na non-religous therapist or counselor would provide a less biased perspective", "Domineering patriarchal leader, consistent disregard of boundaries, supremacy of the father, need I continue?", "Nice attempt to move the target.  I was specifically addressing your statement: \u201cA son is a son until he takes a wife. A daughter is a daughter the rest of her life.\u201d", "No, he didn't. You're full of it.", "That is true, but We live the same distance as her parents so I would have thought the same would apply to them.", "No, we aren\u2019t that far away. Driving distance but not convenient and the same distance as her parents. They decided to tell us over zoom because they were telling her family the next day at an in person dinner and wouldn\u2019t be able to see us in person together for about a month because of both DIL and our travel schedules. My son came to see us in person when she was out of town, but they wanted to tell us together so did it over a call before she left. It was during Covid, but the zoom call wasn\u2019t because of Covid.", "You may be right. I\u2019ve never really thought about it and never gotten any negative response from it outside of this. It\u2019s very common here among family and friends though so I never thought it was a problem."]}
