Hopefully he can quickly sell his assets and transfer them overseas before the child is born so he can dip and not be trapped by this woman. \n\nI wish men had similar rights as women do in the ability to legally abort their relationship to the kid before its born and not be trapped because someone made a decision they couldn't possibly be involved in.

Kids come with bills, and those bills have to be paid by the parents.\n\nHe can't sign away his obligations. If he doesn't want to be involved in child's life, that's fine, but he still has to contribute financially.
