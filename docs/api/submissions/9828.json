Either abort or raise the child on your own without child support. Her going behind the agreement makes HER the asshole especially if she can't afford to have the baby. If she can't afford to have the baby on her own she shouldn't give birth to it or give it up for adoption. She is the asshole in his case.", "If you\u2019re not financially capable of having a baby, then don\u2019t have one. It\u2019s simple. NTA. She\u2019s crazy.\n\nYou can\u2019t bring a life into the world being completely financially unstable, and with someone who doesn\u2019t want the kid. She\u2019s not gonna get any money out of him since she signed the contract so she\u2019s outta luck.", "I would no longer be friends with someone like her. NTA", "It probably is and would be where i am but I don't think you can definitively say this. OP didn't mention where they are, it may be binding in some countries", "Depending on the state, even relinquishing parental rights won't automatically  waive child support obligations.", "It's not at all legally enforceable, at least in the US. LoL Fuck buddy boy was delusional.", "How is op a ah here?", ">I agree with another comment. I would think this would be a pretty rare thing to happen, not impossible I guess but rare that the condom failed and her BC failed\n\nIt's like 1 in a 100 for average use. A lot of things can cause hormonal birth control to fail too. Like grapefruit or antibiotics or just missing a day. Depends on what kind of bc she's on. Condoms can fail pretty easily too. All three of my niblings were failed bc pill accidents xD", "> It would be very interesting to see how this would play out if your friend still decides to keep the baby and goes for child support. Is it a legal document, notarized and signed by witnesses? \n\nIt wouldn't hold. Child support is for the child not the mother, the woman can't just sign a document saying she won't sue for child support when it isn't for her.", "It\u2019s crazy how a lot of this comments are siding with her, he was clear from the start, used protection and told her immediately that he was not going to raise or support it. It\u2019s fucked up how little rights men have when it comes to children, obviously their body their choice but it\u2019s also his finances his choice", "> These other people are using coercion and gaslighting him to be a father when he never wanted that from the start.\n\nIf he doesn't want to be involved in the kid's life, he doesn't have to be.  Still doesn't absolve him of financial responsibility towards the child, though.  Because someone needs to be financially responsible for the child, and I'm not the one who was dumb enough to sleep with this woman, so why should my tax dollars be used to support it?", "The same people that are extremely pro-choice typically cheer when men are forced to pay child support for a kid they didn't want. Only women are allowed to have sex consequence free apparently.", "You've gotten or are in the process of getting a vasectomy..right? For you own sake I hope the answer is yes.", "Do you know every single countries legal system on waivers? Just curious because I\u2019m 99% sure OP and all aren\u2019t in USA", "Oh. And you are NTA for refusing to get involved in what is obviously a completely f\u2019d up argument.", "Reminds me of the sovereign citizen stuff.  The law isn't a magic set of incantations that gets you out of all responsibilities.", "NTA. In most jurisdictions, that contract would not be enforceable.", "Except that this would still be true in most developed countries. I'd need them to specify the country in order to believe that such a document would have any legality.\n\nNTA but this is nonsense.", "Well it wouldn\u2019t wash in Australia, and I doubt hte UK or Canada. So the OP\u2019s options are narrowing.", "Okay- which countries? Name one country with a child support system and abortion access where this waiver would have any validity, I dare you.", "Given OPs previous posts could be either India or Canada. Canada it wouldn't be legal... India on the other hand...", "I think maybe they meant the friend and her fwb, not op. He shouldn't have tried to scam her with that unenforceable contract, but she shouldn't be lying about their relationship and trashing him in social media", "Thanks for the info, I would have thought the odds were higher than that.", "By the looks of OPs page, your tax won\u2019t be supporting it unless your in either India or Canada", "He is going to be financially responsible for the child though... The court will make sure he is responsible through child support. I never said he won't pay or that the tax dollars of hard working Americans would be in jeopardy. \nSo don't worry friend. Your tax dollars are safe. Well as safe as they can be.", "Same for all European countries under EU-law.", "You made the claim it is definitely illegal regardless of where op is. It's on you to prove that. \n\nI merely said it might not be, some countries have extremely underdeveloped and misogynistic legal systems. I wouldn't be surprised if some don't provide the legal right to child support at all.", "OMG!  I haven't laughed so had all day!  This post has been a riot!  OP's friend will be so glad she wrote it!\n\nNTA cuz OP has managed to find support for her friend after all!", "A lot of people don't realize that really simple things like grapefruit or antibiotics can mess with bc too..", "You are definitely wrong.", "While I somewhat agree with you about some countries having misogynistic laws, it\u2019s highly unlikely that she would be allowed to have an abortion in one of those countries exactly for that reason. However I have heard of and seen firsthand people and businesses drawing up and signing ridiculous documents that don\u2019t comply with legislation, then trying to enforce them and getting laughed out of court. Some people genuinely believe that whatever stupid shit is put in writing and signed by both parties is legally bounding.", "Grapefruit ??", "And activated charcoal, if it's oral contraceptive", "Grapefruit messes with the way your body absorbs some medicines. Idk about BC, but I can't eat grapefruit because of my SSRI.", "Your first sentence is so incredibly wrong.", "It\u2019s a good think they\u2019re not in USA aye"]}
