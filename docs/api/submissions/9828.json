She wanted to keep the baby. He didn't. He says he communicated this from the very beginning. Now she's pressurising him to be a father or at least pay child support because she can't afford to take care of the baby on her own. And her parents are back home, so she's alone here. Plus, they're not super rich.\n\nHe apparently made her sign a waiver years ago that if this happened, he won't be responsible for the baby in any way. It's a legal document. She forgot about this. Now she and our other mutual friends are emotionally guilting him to discard the contract and help her out anyway. They've been calling him heartless and cold. He offered to pay for the abortion, but nothing more than that.\n\nShe went emotional and crazy and started making social media posts about how men are all pigs and how her bf (not bf, a fuck buddy) is dumping her when she got pregnant to get sympathy and getting him involved in the child's life. He got nasty reactions from people online and IRL and is super pissed. He also retracted his offer for paying for the abortion. \n\nShe's been asking me to convince him to change his mind because we're friends. I said no because it's none of my business.

I'm sorry but no, he shouldn't be financially responsible here. When I got pregnant with my daughter, I was very much on the same page with her father as we had adult conversations and made adult decisions together. She doesn't get to change the rules because she says so. As women, do we want equal or not because we don't get to have both. I get to decide and you have to pay me isn't acceptable when he was very clear where he stood. He didn't say he didn't want children ever, he said he didn't with her in a legal document. She knew exactly what the parameters were and made the choice to move forward. He wore condoms and she was on birth control. Honestly, how can he be sure it's even his child since they were not in a relationship at all? This was FWB period.", "This is so strange I wonder if it\u2019s made up.

Every precaution would be not having sex with someone you don\u2019t want to have children with. \n\nA paternity test will determine if the child is his, and if it is then he will pay child support.

Child support is absolutely not an obligation to the state, if no state funds are used to support the child. It's bizarre that, in my opinion, I don't think he should have to pay child support? Not that I think he isn't legally obligated, I just don't think he should be legally obligated in this particular situation given how very clearly he absolutely had zero desire to father a child with this woman. She very clearly entered into this arrangement with her eyes open. There was no ambiguity about his intentions which she was fine with for years. Now, she has changed her mind AND is lying about the nature of their relationship for sympathy. Us women either want to be equal OR we don't. We really need to make up our minds.", "He made a conscious choice to engage in an act that informed adults know can lead to pregnancy. How is he not responsible for the consequences of his own actions?", "He was clear enough that they sign legal paperwork making it clear that he absolutely had zero desire to father a child with her. She agreed to the terms for years and he wore condoms while she was on birth control. Literally every part of this makes it crystal clear his intentions. They were not in a relationship. She is trying to force a relationship with someone she was never dating to begin with. How is she not responsible to stick to the agreement she made?", "Except it may not be a legal paper. In most, if not all, states neither the mother or the father can sign away a child's rights to child support *(in the USA)*.", "And I disagree with that being acceptable in situations specifically like this. There was no ambiguity or unclear communication. She changed her mind about having a baby and now wants to act like they were ever anything more than FWB. Like I said, as women, we either want to be equal or we don't. How does he have no say if she has it when he doesn't want it or wants it and she has an abortion. If they don't agree then the person who wants the kid should take all responsibility.y opinion as a woman who has a child, anything less than both parents having the same right from conception on is the only way it will ever be equal.", "He stuck his dick in her- doing so is his acknowledging consent to the possible conception of a child that he will be 50% responsible for. All of his fake \u201ccontracts\u201d (which are 100% fake and going to get him laughed out of court) won\u2019t override the obligation to his child that he was a willing participant in creating. \n\nIt\u2019s disgusting that you think men should be able to force women into abortions because they chose to get their dicks wet without thinking of the consequences."]}
