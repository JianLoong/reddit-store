The courts aren't going to force parenting time or custody if he does not want it. However, he was responsible for bringing a child into the world, so they will force him to to be financially responsible towards that child until it reaches adulthood.", "No. State doesn\u2019t care. Child support is in the best interest of the child, and so they will not absolve him of that responsibility regardless of whether he wanted to be a parent or not.\n\nYou make it, you buy it.", "I'm curious if something like \"I'm suing you for the breach of contract to the amount of whatever the state demands in child support \" would work. \n\nI remember on the show Boston Legal they tried to get a TRO to get a woman to get an abortion. I think they had sex with a condom and she got it from the trash. \n\nThere are legitimate men's rights issues in the world. They are paled in comparison to woman's rights issues, which we've gone backwards on. Don't go to the incel-infested subs about men's rights though. \n\nPersonally I don't think anything related to birth will ever be 100% even in rights to each parent. You have a strange truth table:\n\n--|--|--\n--|He wants the child | He Doesn't \nShe wants | everyone is happy, baby | baby, he's not happy \nShe doesn't | no baby, he's not happy | everyone is ok, no baby\n\nIt's skewed to the fact that the prospective mother always gets what she wants.

One time I saw someone ask how the poster intended to start the conversation about \u201chey, sign this\u201d and the poster said it was really easy to do it the same time that he tells them he can\u2019t wear condoms.
