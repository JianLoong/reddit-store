Have you bluntly told him his words are racist?", "Yeah, NTA, putting the racial discussion aside; if you had posted this story with no ages my first thought would have been, \"your daughter is 18+, right?\"", "NTA. Your friend is a racist and your husband is enabling racial abuse of your child.", "NTA. Fetishizing mixed race children is always in poor taste.", "NTA Calling people exotic has been declaredly out of bounds for over a decade (not to say it was ever good, but that it was much more common) and someone his age should be well aware of that. He needs to cut the shit and stop acting like you noticing his racism is something that *you* did to make *him* uncomfortable.", "NTA. Definitely never leave your daughter *or* your son for that matter alone with this guy. This is definitely creepy.", "NTA husband and his friend are being super weird and if it isn't that big a deal according to them, then it shouldn't be a big deal for this dude to cut out the creepy rude crap he's saying", "NTA. you\u2019ve set the boundary multiple times and he hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s practically fetishising your baby. Also calling her \u201cexotic\u201d is really creepy. Idk I just feel like that\u2019s not a compliment you make about a child.

While complimenting someone their kids is normal, making a thing out of them being mixed isn't.  I have mixed nephews and it would creep me and my sister out if someone started calling them exotic.

NTA 100% NOT THE ASSHOLE. Why are people so weird about babies?", "**NTA**\n\nAnd the reason you're uncomfortable is because he isn't complimenting her at all. He's dehumanising her. He may be describing her in an admiring tone of voice, but THE WORDS HE'S USING TO DESCRIBE HER ARE NOT COMPLIMENTS, they are descriptors that are deeply othering, racist, and dehumanising in the most literal sense - because \"exotic\" is a word that we use to describe unfamiliar things, and particularly ANIMALS . . . it is not a complimentary word that is inclusive of a person's humanity.\n\nAnd as you've said, \"ethnic\" doesn't even make sense as a compliment; your daughter is not of a different ethnicity than this man, and he isn't even specifying an ethnicity that you might belong to. Rather, by calling her \"ethnic\" he is calling out what he perceives as her \"otherness\" . . . how \"different\" she is from what he perceives as \"the norm\" - whiteness.\n\nSo let's be clear: Adam is not complimenting your daughter. Nothing that he says is a compliment by any definition of the word, which is why you are feeling squidgy. Rather, he is repeatedly and deliberately racializing her in an admiring voice. That's not a compliment . . . or rather, he is complimenting your human child in the way one might \"admire\" an animal at the zoo. It's deeply inappropriate and racist AF. And the fact that he only does it to the child whose biracial heritage is most apparent is the clue.\n\nYou don't need to appease him or pretend that he's just awkward or well-meaning. He's racist and refusing to hear you when you say that his words are hurtful to you and your child, the people being racialized (you by extension). Put your foot down and keep it there. And if your husband refuses to hear you, then you have a real problem. But no matter what, you're NTA.", "NTA \n\nDoes he compliment your son for be so Nordic and pale?       \n\nFor him to focus his attention on your daughter that looks more like you it sounds fetishy and not a true compliment.   \n\nAnd why does he have to constantly compliment her in the first place?    \n\nI had an acquaintance from my kids school who was the father of one of my kids friends and every damn time I saw him he tell me how handsome my son is.    I'm, like, thanks, then okay... thank you?     It just was weird and made me feel uncomfortable.    My kid was about 12.  \n\nI hate that your husband blames you for being dramatic.   You don't like his friend's behavior and it's serious enough for you to ask him to talk with him about it.   As if you don't matter as much as his friend.", "Yuck! NTA.
