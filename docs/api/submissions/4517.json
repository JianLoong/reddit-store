He may be describing her in an admiring tone of voice, but THE WORDS HE'S USING TO DESCRIBE HER ARE NOT COMPLIMENTS, they are descriptors that are deeply othering, racist, and dehumanising in the most literal sense - because \"exotic\" is a word that we use to describe unfamiliar things, and particularly ANIMALS . . . it is not a complimentary word that is inclusive of a person's humanity.\n\nAnd as you've said, \"ethnic\" doesn't even make sense as a compliment; your daughter is not of a different ethnicity than this man, and he isn't even specifying an ethnicity that you might belong to. Rather, by calling her \"ethnic\" he is calling out what he perceives as her \"otherness\" . . . how \"different\" she is from what he perceives as \"the norm\" - whiteness.\n\nSo let's be clear: Adam is not complimenting your daughter. Nothing that he says is a compliment by any definition of the word, which is why you are feeling squidgy. Rather, he is repeatedly and deliberately racializing her in an admiring voice. That's not a compliment . . . or rather, he is complimenting your human child in the way one might \"admire\" an animal at the zoo. It's deeply inappropriate and racist AF. And the fact that he only does it to the child whose biracial heritage is most apparent is the clue.\n\nYou don't need to appease him or pretend that he's just awkward or well-meaning. He's racist and refusing to hear you when you say that his words are hurtful to you and your child, the people being racialized (you by extension). Put your foot down and keep it there.

I'm, like, thanks, then okay... thank you?     It just was weird and made me feel uncomfortable.    My kid was about 12.  \n\nI hate that your husband blames you for being dramatic.

You *want* to live in the limbo of never knowing whether you went overboard, never knowing if you are right about that feeling.
