He doesn't. I can fully relate to your desire never to see him again.\n\nYour proposal to see the kids with him absent was good. If he had the kid's interests at heart he would have accepted this. But he wants to use them as a pawn to force you to see him.\n\nDoes he really believe you cannot be trusted with them? Let me guess, you often babysat them for date night.

Here's why.  \n\n\nYOU have your mental health to consider as well. YOU are grieving as well. YOU got blindsided by his behavior and choices. YOU have a right to your boundaries. It being Christmas doesn't mean you have to put up with anything that endangers YOUR mental health.   \n\n\nIt's up to you if this is a temporary or permanent thing. I would at some point talk to him about your feelings as she was YOUR sister and your grief is just as real as his.

Waiting for them to be old enough to be away from him is still a long ass way away and over that time they simply might not want anything to do with you. You cannot explain to them in any way why you, the adult, didn\u2019t make the effort. To them you simply left. Left during a really hard time. My niece and nephew are the same age as them.

It seems you\u2019ve been trying and he just keeps doing things to erase your sister without asking if you would like to have anything. Please try and have a relationship with the kids though. Try and call them, write them letters, send them gifts, and continue to try and see them. Invite them to the park for a picnic and even if BIL shows up, just engage with the kids. You can be polite to BIL without having to actively engage him in conversation. Write BIL a letter and let him know how hurt you are and you know he is grieving but he has damaged your relationship with his choices. Be there for the kids and let them know you love them. \n\nMy \u201cstep-mom\u201d did almost the exact same thing after my dad died. Told me less than a week after he passed if I wanted anything to let her know, but not even 48 hours later had sold anything and everything. Then, I wanted one specific piece of jewelry (a necklace) that my mom had purchased for my dad many years prior to my dad even meeting new wife. She refused. My now wife tried to pay her for it and my dad\u2019s best friend offered to pay even more for it. Everyone tried to get it for me. She refused. Instead she gave me two rings that I had never even seen my dad wear or heard him talk about and tried to say they were some type of family heirloom. That they were so much better than the necklace. She torpedoed any relationship we could have possibly had over a necklace my mom had purchased him. It didn\u2019t make any sense. Now she wonders why we don\u2019t have a relationship and why I don\u2019t put in effort for her to see my kids. I will always resent her for holding on to a piece of jewelry that she had no connection to other than it being my dads. I try to be polite if I have to see her, but she is one of my least favorite people to ever exist. She did many other things after he passed that made me dislike her, but that\u2019s a different story. All this to say, you have a right to be hurt and upset with him.

I am not saying it is your responsibility to single handedly deal with your BIL's grief. I am not saying you are responsible for dealing with your Niece's grief. But you can't claim to care about them (Or care for them as of a week ago) and make the decision to never talk to them again because you would have made different decisions to him when dealing with his grief. \n\nYou are dealing with the same death but not the same grief. Both are equally serious and valid and deserving of help. You are dealing with the loss of a sister, all the memories and pain that come with that. He is dealing with the loss of his wife, by the sounds of it his main support system, and the mother of his children. Emotionally your life will never be the same, but you have to realise that the same is true for him, along with the fact that it will functionally never be the same.", "NTA - pets are a part of a family, you don't just re-home them because they're inconvenient... Especially without speaking with the owner's family, somebody would have probably taken the dog, and now they don't even know if their family member is ok...

It sounds like he wanted to get rid of things that remind him of the pain, and that's understandable. He shouldn't have to keep them around and hurt himself for the convenience of others. But he should have asked family if they wanted things.\n\nBut what you're doing is also hurting your own niece and nephew.

Your bil needs helps and support. \n\nBut I also understand why it may be too much for you and your family to see him after he got rid of the clothes and her dog. As you said, you would have taken them had he asked. Its likely you feel he's erasing your sister and its okay to feel hurt by that. Try to remember that like you, he's just trying to cope. \n\nI would suggest finding a compromise with bil over seeing the children. They're completely innocent in all of this and now is the time they're going to need all the support and love the family can provide.", "I\u2019m going with NAH because this is such a tragic situation and I don\u2019t think anyone has the ability to see things clearly. \n\nBut you had to realize that cutting Luke out would affect access to your sister\u2019s kids? \n\nI\u2019m really sorry for your loss.", "NTA.

I would haunt him to the end of the earth. I understand grief makes you do crazy things but it is an insane red flag that he didn't keep a single keepsake or reminder of the mother of his children... So when they're older and want a connection to their mother...they have none. And they also lost their dog too. I cannot imagine how I'd feel about my father when I grew up and realized he got rid of everything involving my mother so I had nothing. Keep in contact with your niece/nephew because they're the ones who are going to suffer if you don't. if he won't let you spend time alone with them then set boundaries about only meeting in neutral places and him not interacting with you for the time being. Such as a park where you can spend time with them and he sits and reads a book.", "NTA\n\nHe was your sister's partner and is the parent of your niece and nephew.  The kids, the dog, and the personal items are under his control.  You don't have to like it, but it is reality.  In a perfect world, he would have asked for help with these things.  The family could have helped him by getting them out and saving them for if he changed his mind or for the kids.  However, we are not perfect and he reacted in his grief.\n\nIt is not fair for you to be forced to be his crutch, his last connection to the family.  I would image that he has done things that aren't being mentioned here that have pushed the family away.  I would also be worried about him seeing you as a replacement for his wife and his kids' mother.\n\nYou can't make him keep the dog.  You can't force him to allow you to communicate with the kids.  You can protect yourself and your family.  You can be there for the kids when they are able to communicate with you. If your husband needs to be worried about you, you need to be allowed to grieve.  He can befriend the BIL, he can be his crutch and connection to the family if he is so worried.", "Nta\u2026 but for the sake of the children he could \u201ccome\u201d around but I\u2019d be lc with him and work on finding the dog, so call every shelter, put up pictures on social media and send it to the shelters and try hard to find the dog. That way when the children come over they can see their family pet and a connection to their mom. Try to find out where he sent her things see if u can get anything back, especially to pass down. Tell him he can be involved but you need to know where the dog and things are.

Every thing I have of his is a prized possession. A pot he threw, an old tshirt, anything that belonged to him is priceless. I cannot imagine losing all the tangible connections to your sister and nibbling\u2019s mom- not to mention a senior dog.

He\u2019s claiming you need to be there as family, but where was his own sense of family? He didn\u2019t consider \u201chis family\u201d when getting rid of her belongings, didn\u2019t consider the dog family, and is now using his own kids as manipulation for the family. Grief or not, he undermined the idea of family the second that he let his grief destroy the connection he has with the rest of the \u201cfamily.\u201d Note everything you can for the kiddos and explain to them once you can, that their father, unfortunately, chose to hurt them and the remainder of your family. Keep letters, etc for them that can be given to them explaining that you love them, but can\u2019t be around people (their father) that disrespect an entire family, including his own dead wife. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s the worst person alive, but even though grief can cause you to do things you wouldn\u2019t normal do, but there are consequences to every action. Don\u2019t let people in this thread guilt trip you about the kids. The father is the one making the issues, not you. You have every right to keep people that are willing to hurt you, at arms length.

Good luck op.", "Those kids lost their mother and their father decided to either sell everything of hers or just plain get rid of it. That\u2019s terrible for the grieving process and incredibly shady and selfish of him. NTA at all.", "Absolutely NTA. Grief is not an excuse for his behaviour. She was his wife, but she was also a mother, daughter, and sister and he is depriving her loved ones of keepsakes. Worst of all is the dog. Grief doesn\u2019t mean you can just throw out a living creature who is probably now scared and lonely. It\u2019s 11 years old for goodness sake. If my mother had behaved like this when my dad died, I never would have forgiven her.", "He's a massive asshole for giving away your sisters belongings and her beloved dog.\n\nAnd you're an even bigger asshole for punishing your niece/nephew for their fathers behaviour.\n\nYou don't have to forgive him, but you need to make sure you're there for your sisters children... imagine uour grief X 1000.... thats how they're feeling without their mum.\n\nMaybe you can ask your BIL where he rehomed the dog and get him back?  I just feel so sad for those children, losing their mummy and their dog is just heartbreaking.", "ESH, but a soft one.\n\nPeople react differently to grief. You may view her possessions and dog as lovely reminders of her life. He may in his grief have seen them as extremely painful, permanent reminders of his lost love and his children's lost mother and felt getting rid of the reminders would somehow take away the pain. \n\nI can understand your pain, and I can understand his pain.

If your family can afford it and there is still time, get a quiet autopsy.", "NAH. Only because you're grieving, because wow does my heart breaks for your niece and nephew. You don't need to talk to him when you visit them! Just be aware that whatever decision you make, the kids are at a very impressionable age. Right now you're choosing whether you want to be in their lives or not. By the time they're old enough to decide for themselves, or understand why you distanced yourself, it'll be too late. You'll be a stranger who abandoned them. They aren't going to decide to invite a person like that back into their lives. It just doesn't work that way.\n\nI was around the kids' age when my aunt and uncle decided to distance themselves from my mother, instead of step up when I needed them most. We've never been able to repair that relationship. All attachment to them was completely destroyed.", "ESH and here is why- you're abandoning those kids over a greif stricken decision he made. Not the kids. They so need you. Please, please be there for the kids now and sort your feelings later. Please. This is a major defining moment for how they will move forward as a family. If he got rid of the dog, what else might he do? The kids have to deal with all of that. Please help them through it.", "I refuse to call anyone an AH in this situation. Everyone grieves differently, that was his wife. Of course he made rash decisions but he\u2019s not thinking straight at the moment. At the very least ask to contact the people he gave the dog too and give them a run down of what happened. You might be able to get the dog back. I will say if this goes on any longer you will become the AH. He\u2019s asked you for help multiple times and you turned him away. What if the situation was reversed?", "Honestly, YTA. He did ALL of those things in the aftermath of the death of his wife of many years. Had ANYONE from your family bothered to check in on him, you could have helped him AVOID doing destructive things as part of his struggle with grief. You all abandoned a man who just lost his wife, and when he started making poor choices instead of realizing he needed help your entire family doubled down on abandoning him (and his kids - your sister\u2019s kids).", "ESH. Is it a coping mechanism? Some people get rid of everything to get away from the pain!\n\nYou should I ask him why he did all that. Don\u2019t abandon your nieces/nephew like that", "ESH/NAH\n\nYou both are grieving. Sometimes in grief people want no reminders of the one they lost, that is helpful to them. His actions were wrong but justifiable. He feels alone and is acting in pure emotion. He needs help.\n\nYou are grieving too. You probably wanted things that reminded you of her, that must be helpful to you. You feel like you were betrayed by an old friend. He didn't do it on \"purpose\" but it doesn't mean it didn't hurt.\n\nHe isn't letting you contact the children, which must have hurt. Also, he isn't telling you where he left the dog which must have felt like another betrayal. Have a serious talk with him, go into grief counseling, both of you and your mom.

That must be incredibly painful.\n\nThis might be an unpopular opinion, but I think YTA, for essentially the reasons your husband is saying.  Assuming Luke inherited your sister\u2019s things when she passed (you called him your BIL, so I assume they were married), he was entitled to do with them what he wanted.  Maybe he couldn\u2019t cope with having them around, or allocating them, or seeing them in your house.  It was a rash and maybe selfish decision, but he\u2019s mourning the loss of his partner, and it was his prerogative.  I understand she wouldn\u2019t have wanted Frankie put up for adoption, but would she have wanted you to cut out her family either (including her kids, until they can drive or they find someone else to drive them)?", "INFO: Youre saying your sister wouldnt have wanted the dog rehomed, but would she have wanted you to cut contact with her kids over their fathers decision? A decision he is entitled to make, keep in mind.", "Gentle ESH. Everyone grieves in different ways, though I agree that just erasing your sister is a horrible thing for the kids. Alternately, those kids could probably benefit from having you in their lives. Later they might hold it against you that you weren't there for them when they needed you most.

Perhaps he did what he needed to do just to make it 1 more day in an extremely difficult situation. \n\nDo you really value some photos and a pet more than you value your niece and nephew?\n\nThe way I figure things is this.  A person is entitled to go a little crazy when their spouse suddenly dies.  It's a very traumatic event.  Did he handle things in the best possible way, no he did not.  But you seem to be reacting as if he had acted out of some kind of scense of malice.  As if, he never loved her and could not wait to be rid of her, and she died and he was like \"jackpot now I can get rid of all this stuff\".  But you don't really indicate that's what actually happened.  She died, he got rid of her stuff, you are upset that he did not consider giving it to you, that's fine you are NTA for that.\n\nBut I just feel like your overall reaction here is so far over the top so as to be unreasonable.  \n\n> Recently, due to unattended mental health my sister ignored her diabetes and she unfortunately passed away (DKA) it was hard on me and her children, we are still not over it.\n\nPerhaps her HUSBAND is also someone who should be mentioned in that sentence.  Yes, I'm sure as her sister her sudden death was hard on you.  I'm sure it was hard on her children, but I assume it was also hard on her husband.

Do you know how painful it can be for the SO and kids to see her stuff sitting there staring at them all day every day.  They never get a break from being reminded of the one they lost.  It\u2019s not unusual to move things out of sight in frustration, especially knowing she willingly left them behind.  Yes, willingly.   Choosing not to take care of herself was an active choice.  The anger they must all feel.", "YTA, You're taking this out on your sister's family just because he is rehoming the dog? He probably could not look at the dog without thinking about her sister anywhere or something else. Not cool OP", "YTA.. I have seen it happen many many times where people lose their SO and in their irrational behavior due to their loss and grieving they try and remove every last item that would remind them of that person. Your BIL does not sound like he is doing mentally well at all with this loss and on top of that the family he thought he could rely on now has shut him out. What he did was not out of spite. That is the first thing you have to know he did it because all of that stuff reminded him of her and brings back all of the hurt. He absolutely should have given you the dog, the clothes, the paintings, whatever with the contingency that he could have some of the stuff back when he was in a better mental state. At this point he is not thinking about the future and he's going to get to a point where he's going to want that stuff back or at least a token so he could remember and he is not going to have it. He absolutely should not have done what he did. So please do not get me wrong. I am just letting you know in his state of mind he is not doing well. Now more than ever is when he would need family, friends, or support. And I highly doubt your sister would want you to let him suffer the way that he is nor do. I think she would want you to make the kids suffer either. I know you are suffering too and your first question is probably going to be. Why is he acting this way when I am not and to that I answer everybody grieves in different ways. But I would seriously worry about your BIL mental health right now and possibly urge you to reach out to him and maybe even try to get him into therapy.

Imagine being reminded of her and the moments you miss having with her at a glance. Infact it's common for people grieving to leave the deceased room alone, not even opening the door for even months because the pain is too much. The dog was a big reminder too, it wasn't right, he should feel bad about that but when your pain is so great you sometimes do stupid things trying to get even an oz of peace. Please consider what I have said. Right now him and the kids are suffering more then you could imagine i'd wager. Good luck OP, please make the right choice.", "YTA, get over your feelings about him and his actions (it's not about you) be there for you Niece/Nephew.

He definitely should have consulted you and your family before getting rid of your sister\u2019s things (did he sell them? Is he financially ok?). My YTA judgement is purely based on your reaction of cutting him off, because of the way it will affect your niece and nephew. I would advise staying in their lives, even though he is chaperoning them (which I do find a little concerning), so that they know they have someone from their mother\u2019s side.

His brother looks like him, sounds like him, has memories of him that I can never have and shares them with me. I feel connected to my father in my uncle's presence. I see how my father likely would look several years on. He keeps my dad alive in a way my own reminiscing doesn't. I can't know what your BIL's motivations were, or why he was so thoughtless as to her birth family's wishes, but none of that has any bearing on refusing those kids access to her mother's birth family, their memories of her, and the love and tenderness they so deeply need from you all.

So I am going to say that she probably both over-ate and was sedentary. Had she even been taking care of said dog? Depression and other mental health issues can make it hard to do that stuff. Perhaps the dog had more recently fallen to him to care for when she was in the grips of her own demons. If he works that could have led to a lot of destructive episodes in the house, or having to leave the dog outside to avoid that. He wasn't up to the task of being that animal's caretaker any longer. Or she had been caring for it and his life leaves him no room to do the same. I also can say as a kid that I was no dog person, and resented being given the chore of walking him at your nieces/nephews age.

And on the possessions note, my grandfather and UIL were very much the same as your BIL about that. My grandmother's possessions were sorted and donated before the family left town after her funeral. In part because they lived across the country from all but one child/grandchild, so the help that was there was soon headed home (and they were both in their 80s). My UIL had lost my aunt 5 years earlier, and explained it that it was better to purge all the things that turn a corner and see something that reminds you of that person. He said some of the greatest pain came from opening cabinets and finding a box of her toiletries or jewelry that he had missed the first time around. Some folks purge, and other hoard. His grief involved purging. And that is how he handled it. Grief is not logical, and often shuts the wants and needs of others out. Maybe he is mad at her for not taking better care of herself mentally and physically. Or he is overwhelmed with being a widowered dad. Has ANYONE checked in to see how he is faring, or is everyone just mad they didn't get her possessions? BTW, I do get how sentimental everyone is feeling. You are grieving too.

I can imagine not wanting to see my husband's family wearing his hat- because he can't. I can't really get there for myself in the dog because I agree it seems needlessly cruel. But it's my stuff and my dog and I technically can do whatever I want. \n\nThen- after I do what I feel I need to do to survive- the family tells me they hate me and don't want to ever see me again. But hey- send the kids. Send them to people who hate me while I sit in an empty house? Nope. I would be scared they wouldn't come back. \n\nI dont think OP is an AH for her feelings- I really don't. I think everyone here is raw and devastated. Op has the chance to realize they are grieving a wife and mother and OP can use the opportunity to help everyone heal a little. Maybe if BIL feels supported he would tell where the dog or stuff went. Maybe not- he handled this like an AH but so did she.", "I\u2019m on the fence between ESH and no one is an AH because loss like this just devastates some people. I completely understand why OP and her family are so hurt by his actions but I can also understand why he maybe making such horrible decisions. \n\nAs I said in another comment, if he was prone to being this hurtful on purpose, his actions would be such a shock to OP. Since they are, or seem to be, that tells me this man is in crises over the loss and needs help. \n\nI hope the family can mend and find forgiveness over time.", "> Your BIL is disgusting for what he did, & the fact that he is grieving is no excuse. \n\nYes, grieving is an excuse. You clearly have never suffered loss in your life, but when you do, I hope you're treated as coldly as you're advocating for here.", "Ah I see that\u2019s really disgusting, I don\u2019t see how anyone could do something like that, that was probably her baby and a living part of her memory he could\u2019ve held on to or at the very least gave to somebody who would\u2019ve taken care of the poor dog", "Oh I hadn't thought about that!", "The dog is probably already dead.\n\nOtherwise he would just tell her which shelter to get some peace.\n\nAnd remember the children lost both a mother and THEIR dog.", "Jesus your reading skills are terrible.

I wonder if they dog could have helped the kids with their grief.", "So loosing a daughter or a sister isn't loosing someone close?\n\nEveryone is grieving, everyone involved is in pain.", ">Maybe because you all ostracized him\n\nafterwards.

And they absolutely were, especially given that there are kids and living relatives who may have wanted those things.  Whether it was done out of grief doesn't make things better considering she had parents and siblings alive who are also grieving.", "I agree. I couldn\u2019t give a shit about my things and I feel like this is really, really one-sided. \n\nIt sounds exactly like the shit my family would try and pull if I died - villa using my grieving partner over things. \n\nAll my stuff is being left to my partner and some to my children - if they cut off my partner because he didn\u2019t give them stuff that *belongs to him* - I would haunt them forever.", "I would be angry that they erase me from this world, that not even my art survives and that my dog is who knows where. I would like my children to have something of mine to remember me by and that the person I marry does not make things worse, 7 days to do all that. The body wasn't cold and he already threw everything away. \n\nHE ERASE HER", "Tell me, what connections has BIL left for his kids from their mom? I get he\u2019s grieving, but saying it\u2019s about stuff is missing the issue. It\u2019s about not keeping anything of the wives\u2019.", "OP's sister died.  Are OP and mother not allowed to grieve the loss of their sister/daughter, or is husband the only one allowed to grieve?", "I am sure that before the death of op's sister the family babysit for them regularly and they could see them without supervision, the only thing that changed is that the BIL erased everything that was left of op's sister in a selfish attempt to deal with his pain.", ">Except when they decided to cut him AND THE KIDS off. \n\nYeah, the thing that happened after he had ignored them, got rid of their loved ones things without asking if they wanted any, and got rid of the kids' dogs and then refused to tell OP where he sent it. I wonder why they decided to cut him off! What a mystery.\n\nAt some point the sympathy stops. If my spouse acted like this in the wake of my death I would never forgive them.", "Well she doesn't want to contact him", "Well apparently BIL had no problems cutting ties immediately with a 11 year member of the family, all of Sisters irreplaceable artwork, and other items, without so much as a consultation with her family that seems to be interested and care.

It cuts both ways.", "How would he apologize ops never speaking to him again", ">He has to check with ____ about ____ because she liked it or it would fit so and so. Then they all get mad that someone else got what they wanted. \n\nGo to most senior family member, say you're getting rid of everything.

They lost their mother and he took away his dog.", "She isn't abandoning her niece if she wants to continue to have contact but he doesn't let her.

They are grieving. \n\nHe needs to grieve and so does OP. OP may not be able to be there for him, but they want to be there for the children. It's his decision and right if he doesn't agree with them.", "Her artwork... that there is unforgiveable; and then the dog. Yeah, he's WAY past forgiveness.

I remember when my sister and I were on our late teens. My mom gave us so many of her clothes she had from when she was younger. My sister still has some of my mom's jackets. It was a great bonding experience. She passed away from old age a little more than a year ago. If my sister and my father had thrown away all of her stuff without even asking me if I wanted something I don't know how I would forgive them. In a few years the kids will be posting here asking if they are the assholes for spending holidays with their mom's family and not their dad who acted like an insensitive asshole when their mom died and tried to alienate them from her family.", "I don't think he threw them away. A part of me thinks he sold them all. Sold everything she owned. Made money off that. Cuz based on OPs post the dude is telling her he is struggling. I feel like the money ran out.", "The guy is grieving and probably isn\u2019t acting super rational right now.  Maybe all the sister\u2019s stuff is unbearable for him in this moment and he could not deal with it.  \n\nWill he regret it later? Probably.  But at this point I don\u2019t want to judge.", "People grieve differently and don\u2019t always make sound decisions. Which is why people are cautioned to not make any major decisions for a year after loosing a spouse or child. \n\nHim getting rid of all her stuff can be explained by this. \n\nThe dog baffles me as I\u2019m sure the kids would have been attached too but instead of immediately cutting him off, OP should keep the lines open as he sounds like he might be in crises and for the sake of the kids\u2019 well-being/safety, she needs to have access to them.", "Nobody is entitled to a dead persons stuff just because they are dead! People are such vultures.", "You sound like someone who has never lost anyone. A pet knows nothing about human death.

It's more like he doesn't want the kids spilling....something.", "Except OP offered to see and talk to the kids without him present, because his presence causes them pain.

I have most certainly experienced sudden loss & grief multiple times in my life.  Of course everyone grieves differently & deserves some grace during such difficult times.  But Frankie is a living, breathing animal that deserves love & care, just like OP's sister provided to Frankie for 11 years prior to her death.  I don't begrudge BIL for deciding he could no longer care for Frankie following OP's sister's death.  However, the way he handled the situation is inexcusable.  Just because someone is grieving does not give them an excuse to be cruel or neglectful to another living being.  OP would have taken Frankie in, as would have other members of OP's family.  It would have arguably taken less effort for BIL to contact OP or the family to take Frankie than to 'drop him of at a random kennel.'  Simply put, you don't get to be a bad person & hurt an innocent animal just because you're grieving.\n\nEdit: spelling.", "BIL is STILL refusing to tell the family where the dog is/was.

Before that, OP was perfectly content cutting the kids off for potentially *years* until they can travel independently.", "I clearly advised against that. I said YTA. Are you even reading?", "His frequent calls to OP suggest grieving.", "You're free to have a different thought process, but I disagree. I think sticking to this knowing it means she won't be there for the kids is abandoning them and flies directly in the face of \"this isn't what my sister would want\". She can be upset about the dog of course, but goddam the kids are more important than that.", "That makes it so much worse!", "It doesn't necessarily mean he's struggling financially-it could mean he's emotionally or mentally struggling.", "I can understand not wanting her stuff around.  But then you box it up and put it in the attic so you can go through it when you are in a better place, not toss it without asking her family.\n\nMy dad gave away my mom's yarn after she died.  Mom and I both knit, it was a connection we had.  It damaged our relationship permanently.", "Grief doesn't give you a free pass to be a thoughtless aaahole. Yes, he lost his wife but his kids lost their mother and OP lost her sister. He doesn't get to own the grief of her loss, it's not just him effected. Throwing away all her stuff threw away any heirlooms the kids could have from her. It's selfish of him and nothing he said to OP sounds like he's thinking of anyone but himself.\n\nAlso the dog isn't an animal, it's a part of the family. All that dog has known for the past 11 years is that family and he just decides to (I'm assuming) kill the dog. It's super fucked up. A dog is only a part of your life, but you are their entire life. It's one thing I think Europe does 1,000x better than America, dogs are a member of the family in most European nations.", "Depends on if the kids love the dogs. My sister has 2 dogs and her kids don\u2019t really enjoy having them around.", "The dog makes sense to me if he\u2019s struggling with grief. Right or wrong when you are struggling it\u2019s another dependent. I love my pets, but when I had my baby I resented the hell out of them. I was sleep deprived and they were two other living beings dependent on me. Now, I took care of them and I never abused them, but there definitely were times I wished I didn\u2019t have pets. When they pass I won\u2019t get more. \n\nSo while it\u2019s not nice, I can understand the fact that he\u2019s probably struggling to make it through the day and take care of two little humans who also lost someone. They are the priority and a pet can feel overwhelming. He didn\u2019t handle it right, but he lost his wife so I would expect him to mess up.", "Agreed. Some people need to get rid of everything because everything reminds them of the loss. It's not rational, but it's how they deal with the grieving process.", "There's a difference between give me her TV and if you don't want to keep her artwork I'd love to have it. You're ridiculous for thinking it's OK for him to throw out her art and other personal items. Her jewelry should've gone to her kids. They weren't vultures looking for stuff, they were family wanting heirlooms and things to remember her by. He doesn't get own the grief of her passing, it's not all about him. She had other people in her life that she was important to, like the rest of her family.", "Dogs definitely do know about death and understand it. Most animals do and you saying they don't it doing them a huge disservice. Also the dog just lost its owner and now is most likely just left on the side of the road.
