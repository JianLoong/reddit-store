We are still adjusting to life with 2 kids and are constantly sleep deprived due to feeding the infant at night and the 2-year-old going through a sleep-regression.  I just went back to work about 6-weeks ago and everything in our lives is pretty chaotic right now but we are doing our best to hold it together.  \n\nMy husband's older brother (39M) and his wife (40F) have a 4-year-old son.  We are pretty close to them and get along with them really well. They've helped us with babysitting our 2-year-old a handful of times in the past year or so when we need it, but only one overnight when my husband and I had a wedding to attend when I was still pregnant with #2.  Our 2-year-old loves his cousin and will follow him everywhere when they are together, it's pretty cute.  \n\nA couple days ago, my BIL's wife called me and asked if there's any way we could watch their son this coming Saturday because they are attending a concert out of town.  She said she knows it's short notice, but their scheduled babysitter had to back out due to illness and now they're scrambling to find a replacement.  She said they've tried a few other options but no one can help and we were their last option.  \n\nI told her I would have to talk with my husband first.  When we talked about it, we both agreed that with how tired we already are, adding a 3rd kid to the mix, even for one night, is asking a lot from us and we don't feel comfortable doing it.  I sent my BIL's wife a text outlining our position and politely telling her we can't do it.  All I got as a response was an \"OK.\"  \n\nNot even an hour later though, my BIL sent my husband a long text detailing every single time they babysat for us.  He either has a very good memory or he was keeping track on a spreadsheet lol.  BIL said that this is the first time they have ever asked us to babysit and the fact we are not willing to help them out speaks volumes.  BIL said that next time we need a sitter to not even bother asking them unless it's a literal life or death emergency.  \n\nMy husband showed me the text because he didn't know how to respond to it.  I told him they are probably just frustrated and lashing out and there's no need to engage any further.  We have legitimate reasons for not being able to help and it's not our fault that they are salty about it.  \n\nHowever, BIL's guilt trip seemed to work a bit on my husband and he tried to convince me that we can probably make it work to help them for just one night.  I told him we are both already short on sleep and energy and I don't have it in me to chase a 4-year-old around or deal with any issues that he might have staying in a new place for the first time.  \n\nI told that BIL and his wife will figure it out and even if they don't, missing a concert isn't the end of the world and they can probably even sell their tickets still if they try.

The BIL's text was crystal clear.  They've helped you multiple times.  You won't even help them this one time when they're stuck.  As a result, they're not going to be there for you in future.\n\nYour response to call it a \"guilt trip.\"  Good try but it's not.  Your BIL pointed out that you and your husband are takers.  You expect to be taken care of but don't help in return.  That's not a guilt trip, that's stating reality.  You've also minimized and dismissed that they're going to miss a concert.  The tickets would have been expensive and I bet they don't go to many concerts.\n\nI don't understand why your husband is standing back and doing nothing while you encourage him to ruin his relationship with his brother.  Your husband needs to grow a backbone and some morals and stand up to you.  You sound awful.", "Really? It's a one-time thing on short notice, and you even admit they've done a lot for you (\"a handful of times in the past year or so when we need it, but only one overnight when my husband and I had a wedding to attend\"). The snark that your BIL \"either has a very good memory or he was keeping track on a spreadsheet lol\" also is pretty telling; I'm wondering if your \"handful\" is more than you admitted. \n\nSay goodbye to future help from them and a pretty hard frost on the relationship. YTA.", "YTA. It\u2019s one night. \n\nI doubt that BIL has a spreadsheet of dates, but the fact that he could rattle off a number of times that they had helped you out\u2014compared to the ZERO times you have helped them\u2014speaks volumes. You are damaging a relationship over one ask.", "Hmm... selfish, the pair of you. I'm with your BIL - don't ask them for help again if you're going to be unwilling (which is fine) and have zero empathy (which is not) when they have a need in the moment. \n\nI'm going one step further: they planned a sitter. I'm betting you didn't even bother for the wedding, and that you just asked BIL and wife for help. \n\nYTA. You know it. Your husband knows it. They know it.", "YTA, you couldn\u2019t suck it up for one night to babysit, and now you screwed yourselves out of 2 people that have helped you a lot over the past few years with your kids. You can\u2019t expect them to constantly help you out with your kids, if you won\u2019t do the same in return. Also, your 5 month old should definitely be sleeping fairly well throughout the night at this age. I would talk to your pediatrician.", "YTA. \n\nI get it, kids are hard, and your relationship with your BIL and his wife should not be transactional. However, this is the definition of taking advantage of someone. You took advantage of your BIL's generosity and love for you all those times they babysat your kids, and repayed that kindness with telling them you're too tired to take care of their kid for 1 night. Pathetic excuse. Enjoy your newly severed relationship. Family dinners are gonna be awkward for awhile.", "YTA, you burned that bridge but good.", "Hopefully you'll never need to ask them for a favor because that train has left the station.  Try not to be \"salty\" when they say no.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Do you think they were always excited to take your 2 year old? And your attitude toward BIL\u2019s completely reasonable text is out of touch and pedantic. You\u2019ve also screwed yourself, burning that bridge. I have a feeling you\u2019ll be begging for their help and playing victim when you don\u2019t get it sooner than you think.", "The real question here is whether saying no for one Saturday evening is worth losing a babysitter forever. Do future acts of help mean you're required to help in return? Of course not. But, refusal likely means you won't get the help in the future.  It's up to you to decide how to proceed, regardless of who is and isn't the asshole. \n\nYou're entitled to say no. You BIL is entitled to stop watching your kids if you won't watch his.", "It\u2019s a shame you couldn\u2019t put yourself out for just one night after everything they\u2019ve done for you both. You\u2019re knackered anyway, I doubt nephew would have made much difference \n\nIt sucks to be you when you need them again and they tell you to get lost. You\u2019ll be in Reddit crying then because in-laws won\u2019t help you out and you don\u2019t know why \n\nYTA", "YTA if you ever want them to help watch YOUR kids again. I wouldn't expect them to, as they said. I get that it's tough but you bet it was tough watching your kid when they did it for you, too! If it's every man for themselves just don't expect it in return, like they said to you. I would seriously just consider sucking it up for one night -- a 4 year old is pretty good at sleeping.", "Yta. So they can babysit for you and watch your kid overnight, but you can't? It's one time. It's not like they plan poorly, they're babysitter fell through. I hope they never babysit for you again because you guys are selfish", "YTA. It\u2019s one night.", "YTA.  Of course they know how tired you are.   They wouldn\u2019t have asked if they had other options, and there\u2019s a valid reason for the short notice.    Adding this kid is hardly going to jam up your life for 24 hours, and actually, might even help since your youngest has such a bond with him, so you may have to micro manage him less.\n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to help them of course, but you should.   \n\nIf you don\u2019t, don\u2019t count on them ever sitting for you ever again.\n\nTheir kid is 4 and they\u2019ve NEVER ASKED before.   That\u2019s actually kind of amazing\u2026you  are blowing the relationship trust me.", "YTA- babysitting for you means you are babysitting for them it\u2019s literally tit for tat", "YTA because you had no problem receiving help multiple times. It's only fair to help them at least once, even if it is difficult.", "YTA\n\nThey help you, you help them, it's how it works.  They haven't ever asked before, and they will probably not make a habit of it.  You said yourself you are close, and your toddler loves his cousin.   You should be helping, being tired is part of parenthood, drink some coffee and play with the kids for one night.", "YTA, one night, sorry your sleep deprived.  The 4 yo would likely keep your 2 yo entertained and make it a little easier on you.  It's ok for them to take your kid, but an unexpected turn of events and you can't put yourself out to help them out.  Your BIL and SIL have reason to be upset.  Your comments about missing the concert and selling the tickets is a little more than self absorbed.", "YTA\n\nWhile I get that doing someone a favor shouldn't be used to \"keep score,\" there is something of an expectation of reciprocity. I.e., if I help you out when you need it, I would expect you to help me out when I need it. And this is not a huge ask, nor is your reasoning much more than \"nah, we just don't wanna.\"\n\nI would apologize, blame it on being stressed out and tired, and tell them to enjoy the concert.", "I totally understand the exhaustion, but is it possible to find a compromise?  Maybe your husband can take the 2yo and go stay at BIL\u2019s house with the 4yo, while you stay home with the baby.  Divide and conquer, just for one night?", "YTA - suck it up for one night, get the kids some crayons and pop in a movie. Get chicken nuggets and fries and help them out this once.", "NAH. This is simply a natural consequence for your choice- and you had your reasons. It doesn\u2019t make you an AH but neither are they. They\u2019ve likely altered plans, taken your kid when it was less convenient for them than they would have liked etc. Now that they know the relationship isn\u2019t reciprocal they\u2019re not interested in participating in the future.", "YTA, and ya know it.", "YTA. Wouldn't kill you to reciprocate for someone who has helped you out. Wow not only did you screw yourself out of people who were willing to help you but now you have started a grudge in the family. Double AH for doing it by text\n Coward", "YTA. You said they babysat for you a few times and you can't suck it up for 1 night? Yes, you are an asshole. Especially for telling them that their tickets will sell and missing the concert isn't the end of the world. You know what also isn't the end of the world? Helping out family that have helped you before. You are selfish.", "YTA. So they\u2019ve done enough for you that they would need a literal spreadsheet to remember it all, and you can\u2019t help them ONE TIME because you\u2019re tired and don\u2019t want to chase a 4 year old? Do you think they were never tired and not really feeling it any of the MANY TIMES they took care of your son and ran around after a toddler? \n\nYou\u2019re horrifically entitled and your dismissal of their feelings by saying \u201ctHeY\u2019rE gUiLt TrIpPiNg Us\u201d shows how out of out of touch you are. \n\nYou\u2019re clearly only interested in taking from your relationships and are unwilling to put yourself out at all to give back. I\u2019d never do anything for you, even in a literal life or death emergency situation. \n\nYou\u2019re selfish.", "Oh those main character syndromes!\n\nYTA.", "I'm not going to say you're an AH because I don't know how run down you are feeling right now, but this was a monumentally stupid move. Like world-class, Olympic-level stupid. You had a great thing going on and you ruined it. Reciprocal childcare arrangements are hard to find.", "YTA. This is why kids are hard! Just help them out.", "ESH: I'm sure with what's already been said, the relationship is a mess. Since you've already declined I doubt they'll even consider letting you do it... even if you change your mind. They've helped you, I would think you'd want to help them in return. Though caring for children shouldn't really be a tit for tat thing.", "Nta, personally I would offer to schedule to babysit him but not overnight since you guys are overwhelmed during that time. That you are sorry you cant do it this time but would be happy to at a different type with better notice.", "Don't do it. It wouldn't be fair to you or to their son if you babysat him when you're already extremely tired and busy with your own children.\n\nIf they've helped you in the past by babysitting your son, it's only fair that you return the favor, but they don't have to demand when and how. You refused this time for very understandable reasons, you didn't refuse to babysit forever, they should take a step back. Throwing a tantrum because someone decided not to do you a favor is always an asshole move.\n\nEdit : for those who say OP is TA, what will happen if the child is not supervised properly because of tiredness ? What if he gets hurt ? Does he deserve to be looked after by a very tired and already overwhelmed adult ?\n\nNTA", "NTA. If you don't want to, you don't want to. But I suspect the ramifications of this will linger and affect the relationship between you all. One night? Yes it's a sacrifice, but it also could have been a fun night for your 2 year old to have with his cousin. And they did if for you for the wedding.", "NTA. Its possible that a phone call could've gone smoother than a text (people are weird about perceived tone) but ultimately you handled this properly. Whereas they acted immaturely and irrationally. You were putting more than just your needs first. You're putting everyone's well being first by being able to admit that you are TOO DAMN TIRED for an extra kid right now!", "Nah i understand your brother in law and wife have right to be frustrated with you and you have to understand that you did burn that bridge and can no longer can count on them to babysit. But if you and your husband are as sleep deprived as you claim to be then taking on another child can be potentially dangerous.", "NTA.\n\nI you let BIL guilt you into this, he will know he can enslave you anytime he wants to.\n\nAnd he will want to.\n\nDo not cave.\n\nIf you lose access to their help, fine, lose it. Go NC on them, see how they like it,\n\nBut enough with these Reddit relatives forcing posters to bow to their will.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Instead of worrying about your sleep schedule, maybe think about your 2 year old who might enjoy some one on one time with a child around their age to play with.
