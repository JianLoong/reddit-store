You also can't read minds and from what you said you didn't know this prior. I'm sure if she had come to you and said \"nephew needs new clothes and I can't afford it, are you able to help?\" things would have different. \u20ac5 a month is equivalent to a coffee, a subscription to Netflix or Spotify, a pack of cigs, a drink or 2 in a bar.

You earn your money and it's not your responsibility if your Sister can't manage her finances. She's taking advantage of you and your Parents and using her Son to do it.\n\nWhere's the Baby Daddy in all of this ?", "NTA. Anytime a parent says something to a non parent about how the non parent finances should go to a kid who's not their own. Anything the non parent says is fair game. OP please don't spend anymore money on your nephew, or your sister. If she can't appreciate you for free why pay?", "You're definitely NTA and hopefully this all dies down for the greater good of \"family harmony\", hopefully your sister was just having a bad day and she realizes she was out of line.  \nHowever, if she brings it up again, and depending on how \"spicey\" your mood is and how HILARIOUS you feel like being you could always say something like...\n\n  \n\"How about this sis....I'll keep spending 5Euro that I earn, on a game that I want to play, and you keep letting guys spunk in you and have kids you can't afford, and we'll see who's life get's happier, faster?\"\n\n  \nHow do you think that one will go over? Personally, I feel that one is comedy GOLD!", "NTA. \n\nAlso,\n\n>\"too judgemental of her parenting\"\n\nYeah, don't do it if you can't take it. It goes both ways.\n\nIf she can't handle snarky judgments, she should make  snarky judgments.", "I think she thinks that since me and my parents buy him stuff anyway she can just waste her money however she likes", "My nephew's father is unknown, my sister met him in a club and he was a one night stand so he is not in the picture unfortunately.

She is not broke by any means.", "She does work and she used to use almost all her money on my nephew, however it gradually became less and less as he grew older. I think it's about time to remind her whose child my nephew is...", "My sister has a part time job and she lives with my parents, who also act as free sitters and buy my nephew things. She has a ton of people helping and supporting her and so I feel like she's starting to think that she can waste all of her money in what she wants because there's going to be someone else buying stuff for my nephew anyway.", "You're NTA for choosing to spend your money how you like, but similarly neither is she. If she wants to go clubbing instead of spend on her kid, that's her choice. So leave that out of it next time\n\n(not defending her choice, just saying be consistent)", "I'm helping with the expenses so that my sister and parents won't have to shoulder these costs alone, however lately my sister has barely been spending a dime on him\n\nWe don't know who the father is unfortunately, he was a one night stand", "The problem is that then my nephew would become mostly my parents' financial responsibility and I don't want them to have to face it alone", "That's exactly the point my man, you don't need to pay for her poor choices. You do enough.", "As the uncle you should only really be buying (if you want, you're not obligated to) fun stuff that you want to buy, toys for you to play together, films to watch together, activities you want to take him to. \n\nIf people want to help their family with finances that's totally fine but it seems like it's doing her a disservice to be honest, she has a dependant and your parents and you may not always be able to help, but she's never had to truly rely on herself. It's also making her entitled and selfish. You should do just that, maybe have a chat with your parents about it?", "Of course, he doesn't but your sister does for her shitty comment.", "Well I\u2019d stop bailing her out b/c she\u2019s gonna keep making you do it \u2026especially for things like formula that she should totally budget for cause that\u2019s a necessity. Idk it really sounds like taking advantage of the situation which sucks but definitely never feel bad for spending your money how you want especially when you don\u2019t need help from others to make it to the end of the month", "And if you keep bailing her out she will only keep doing it. My parents were like this with my sister and are still supporting her in her 40s because she always knows they were bail her out. It's about time she stepped up and looked after her own kid.", "Yes, absolutely."]}
