Most rural communities, especially farming communities, are incredibly tight-knit and pride themselves on their \"help your neighborhood mindset-\" that being said, it goes both ways. A cow getting out is nothing, and while mildly annoying, is honestly fairly mild. And, unfortunately, bound to happen. Giving \"dirty looks\" while they are trying to corral and herd the animal is just rude and unnecessary. If you are playing music in your car loud enough at night that the people with \"lots of land\" around you can hear, that is a problem. \n\nHonestly, this is on your parents. They have done you a massive disservice by uprooting you to somewhere with a different social structure, and instead of them making amends with neighbors in some way/shape/form, they are putting all of the consequences on you. I am guessing from the large pig barn reaction, that there is far more going on than just a teenager with an attitude. A large shed construction like that is in no way cheap, not to mention the pigs, set up, and feed for them- a move like that is not to get rid of an eye-rolling music playing teen, but to get rid of a whole family.", "YTA. \n\nQuotes around the word neighbors told me everything I needed to know.

Got that fixed in your mind? Okay, now add the smell of human shit and farts to it. Got that now, the ammonia plus the human waste smell? Okay, now add the smell of a really terrible case of BO that has been left to marinate for a while\u2014like a shirt that a sweaty dude wore while exercising and then forgot in the trunk of his car for two weeks during a hot, humid summer.

I spent 5 minutes near a pig barn at a historical farm years ago, and the smell is edged in my brain.\n\nWe were in the horse and cow barns for a good 30 minutes watching demos.

I could breathe fine after a couple minutes.\n\nWhen we made our way to the pig barn, the guide told us they kept them so far from the visitor center and the demo barn because of the smell. He gave us plenty of warning about the smell. There was never enough warning for that smell.\n\nJust imagine all the vile shit your mind can conjure up and multiply that by 10 and you'd get close to the smell. Here's the other thing: you can't tune it out like horse and cow shit. It's a constant assault on your nose. Just when you think you can take a breath trough your nose, nope, that shit will have you doubled over retching.\n\nThat was a barn with 5 pigs. I can't imagine the monstrosity that is the smell of 200 pigs anywhere within a mile of my house.\n\nOP's made up parents are fucked five ways to Sunday.", "It is very different from cow smell.  Cows eat grasses and it give them a faintly sweet undertone to their feces.  Pigs eat slop.  This (along with just biological differences) results in pigs releasing higher amounts of gasses that smell awful.  So fewer pigs create higher stink then cows.

Having grown up in a small farming community, I can't help but think there has got to be more you aren't telling us.  Either way, OP,  you may want to try and \"mend fences\" on this one.

But when you get up before the suns up 9pm is late. Also FYI entitled child. Farmers don\u2019t let cows out to wonder on to other ppls yards. Animals get out that farmer who cow got out now has to spend money to fix his fence. I am not a farmer but married into a farming family. We don\u2019t farm but the house across the street and behind us. Both have big farmers and there horses and cows get out. Once in a blue moon cause that\u2019s life. You know what I do as a response and respectful human I help them get there animals back. Cause as much as I don\u2019t want a cow in my back yard they don\u2019t want a cow in my back yard too.  But I LOVE LOVE the fact her built a PIG \ud83d\udc37 barn rt next to your house. Love that you think it\u2019s not a big deal. Your dad rt he not going to get much money for that house now.

The town my family lives in has a population of about 900 people. Everyone who lives in this town is a farmer, owns a feed store, or fixes machine equipment. Everyone in this town is in bed by 9pm and up at 4am. \n\nThe reason my family gets up at 4 and start there day is to try and get as much work done before it gets hot out. Anyways we would spend summers here and one time after we got done working we wanted to have a bond fire and play some music. We where blasting ac dc when there neighbor comes over and starts whipping us with a switch. My uncle busts out the door and sees this guy hitting us with the switch and confronts him. Literally told my uncle we where blasting that god damn rock music past 9pm and he has an early start. We then get whipped by my uncle for being assholes. \n\nI think its less to do with racism an more what's popular in major cities at the time. Like all the people in this town hate city people. They view them as lazy and weak. In OPS case I think the neighbors view these yuppies who moved in next door and do not know what it means to work in agriculture. Its less a job and more a lifestyle. \n\nIts especially shitty if ops homes are set up like I'm familiar with. Typically the main households are pretty close to the main road. Even though farmers have 1000s of acres they build there homes somewhat close to each other. I guess for security. then typically your barn will be a little distance from the home. They put the barn far enough from the house so the starting of equipment does not wake up infant children. So what me and my brother would do is just listen to the music in the barn because it was far enough from the main house and neighbors your not disturbing anyone. \n\nalso Op is greatly underestimating how much that many pigs smell. My uncles pig barn was on the opposite end of his property and still on hot and windy days you could smell it at the main residence.", "OP said she was listening to rap, we don't know that the neighbors complained specifically about it being rap.

The Act provides an ***exemption to a building erected solely for agricultural purposes***. Under that exemption, agricultural buildings do not need to receive a permit. Many municipalities still require the farmer to complete an affidavit attesting that the building is solely used for agricultural purposes.\"", "Horse farm here, \n\nYeah my parents saved up for decades for half of that purchase.\n\nIt's amazing people actually think this is real.\n\nIt's like saying, we came home and there was a helicopter & pad right outside my bedroom window and it was all because I'm too sassy.

In my experience, in small towns, it's much more understood to let the little things roll off you with a chuckle because there's no real anonymity, giving someone shit for minor indiscretions actually affects your relationship with the whole community because in a sprawling area with a lower population it's hard for small things to truly result in a negative impact. \n\nWhereas in big cities there's nothing but anonymity so the concept of friendliness very much relies on someone's proactive awareness and mitigation of their own impact on others - in a big city if everyone is cavalier about those little things they pile up exponentially in a pretty terrible way so it's viewed as a bigger transgression.\n\nEx. in a town of 500 people if 1 lets their cow eat your grass once, that's really not a big deal. The same scenario in a city of  5 million means you have 10,000 cows munching away (roughly 27 cows a day over the course of a year). \n\nNow obviously that's not something that happens in the city, but the point about exponential impact stands.\n\nOP glaring the farmer down over the cow was likely seen as an overreaction when the expectation was probably to laugh over Bessie breaking out for a visit and a snack while working together to get her home.\n\nOP is struggling to read the room like most people her age, but I'm sure her obvious disdain for the town is not going unnoticed and is only adding fuel to the fire.", "It looked like she was never taught any manners", "I think if you are used to city life you don't realize how much more important your community becomes in rural areas.

Need some help with heavy lifting? Have a medical emergency? Expensive tool broke?

The farmers also tend to be townies and get a lot of support from the other townies as farming has a 'halo effect' they can take advantage of.
