Most rural communities, especially farming communities, are incredibly tight-knit and pride themselves on their \"help your neighborhood mindset-\" that being said, it goes both ways. A cow getting out is nothing, and while mildly annoying, is honestly fairly mild. And, unfortunately, bound to happen. Giving \"dirty looks\" while they are trying to corral and herd the animal is just rude and unnecessary. If you are playing music in your car loud enough at night that the people with \"lots of land\" around you can hear, that is a problem. \n\nHonestly, this is on your parents. They have done you a massive disservice by uprooting you to somewhere with a different social structure, and instead of them making amends with neighbors in some way/shape/form, they are putting all of the consequences on you. I am guessing from the large pig barn reaction, that there is far more going on than just a teenager with an attitude. A large shed construction like that is in no way cheap, not to mention the pigs, set up, and feed for them- a move like that is not to get rid of an eye-rolling music playing teen, but to get rid of a whole family.", "YTA. \n\nQuotes around the word neighbors told me everything I needed to know.

I grew up in wheat farming country, so my friend who had pigs only had a few for their family\u2019s own consumption and to barter with neighbors.

Got that fixed in your mind? Okay, now add the smell of human shit and farts to it. Got that now, the ammonia plus the human waste smell? Okay, now add the smell of a really terrible case of BO that has been left to marinate for a while\u2014like a shirt that a sweaty dude wore while exercising and then forgot in the trunk of his car for two weeks during a hot, humid summer.

I spent 5 minutes near a pig barn at a historical farm years ago, and the smell is edged in my brain.\n\nWe were in the horse and cow barns for a good 30 minutes watching demos.

I could breathe fine after a couple minutes.\n\nWhen we made our way to the pig barn, the guide told us they kept them so far from the visitor center and the demo barn because of the smell. He gave us plenty of warning about the smell. There was never enough warning for that smell.\n\nJust imagine all the vile shit your mind can conjure up and multiply that by 10 and you'd get close to the smell. Here's the other thing: you can't tune it out like horse and cow shit. It's a constant assault on your nose. Just when you think you can take a breath trough your nose, nope, that shit will have you doubled over retching.\n\nThat was a barn with 5 pigs. I can't imagine the monstrosity that is the smell of 200 pigs anywhere within a mile of my house.\n\nOP's made up parents are fucked five ways to Sunday.", "It is very different from cow smell.  Cows eat grasses and it give them a faintly sweet undertone to their feces.  Pigs eat slop.  This (along with just biological differences) results in pigs releasing higher amounts of gasses that smell awful.  So fewer pigs create higher stink then cows.

That's why all the male pig farmers I know are bald lmfao", "Also if I'm not mistaken (because there aren't any farms near where I live) farmers need to go to sleep early, so they can rest well and wake up extremely early (like with the first rays of sunlight for example) to do their job right?", "I was waiting for this lmao, OP is obviously not telling the whole story. To do all of this over \"rap music at 9pm\" is pretty hilariously poorly veiled. \n\n\"I moved into a tight knit community that works the land and helps their neighbors, I refuse to do that, have a small residential lot in the midst of a large agricultural area, and have been openly condescending and rude to the people around me\"\n\nYou get the hog shed.", "Ding ding ding! We have a winner. It is always amazing to me when people move to different areas of our country (I'm assuming we're both in the US), then expect local traditions/mores to change according to the newcomers' desires.  Not to break my own arm patting myself on the back, but when I moved to a big city from a small town, all I could afford at first was a small apartment in a community dominated by a culture not my own. You know what I did? I went with it. I never complained about stuff I didn't like, and was really pretty much the nicest neighbor you could ask for.  Because I recognized that my problems with this community were just that: MY problems.", "OP is 18 years old, you think she wanted to be uprooted from the city in her final year of high school so her parents could save some money?\n\nI\u2019m seriously asking because if your answer is yes you need some mental help", "This. It's probably a net loss of several hundred thousand dollars in property value, if not more if the house is a bigger mcmansion type thing.", "Yeah OP seems overly combative. Especially since its her parents house and she will be old enough to move on soon.", "Let's be fair to the actual update.\n\n\"I am in college back in the city, miles and miles away, my parents are seriously pissed at me that they have to deal with the fact that their neighbors are petty children who went nuclear against a teenager that's not even going to be around for another couple months?\"", "Yes. That is the point of reference I mentioned.", "Yes. And not only clothing\u2014it permeates plastics, wood, and paper goods. After a year or possibly even less, it wouldn\u2019t matter if the neighbor gave up farming and removed the whole pig barn, at 20 feet away the house would smell like pigshit for a good long time anyway, same as a chain smoker\u2019s home/belongings smell like smoke long after they quit. And all of the possessions OP takes to college, and the boxes she takes them in, will smell like pigshit too.\n\nOP, this is nothing like what cows in a field smell like. Cow patties smell downright wholesome next to what pigs produce. Imagine that your neighbor has decided to keep skunks next to your property and you\u2019re getting the idea.", "Yeah pig farms are a different ballgame from a cattle farm", "It's worse than that. It's now worth exactly what the farmers bordering the property are willing to pay for it. Because those are now the only buyers.\n\nThat being said, OP has to be underplaying their actions, because this is a several hundred thousand dollar (at minimum) revenge plot. The building's not cheap, and the pigs aren't cheap to buy, feed, or care for. It will take years for this to venture to break even.", "This has been my exact thought since the start of this post. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd2e", "Good point, and as always we have scant context here. \"Rap music at 9 p.m.\" could easily be evidence that the neighbors are super racist, and this is them being super racist, but maybe it could also be a \"clueless teenager blasts rap music while neighbor hosts a wake for a deceased friend\" sort of situation. Who knows. It is insanely difficult to imagine a scenario justifying the neighbor's actions based on what we know.", "Since OP seems to be living in a decently rural area, the question is how loud this music needed to be to disturb the neighbors....Unless the houses were on top of each other we're talking a ridiculously loud disturbance to be noticeable...", "I don't disagree with you! But that's not the situation now. Now the situation is wayyyyyyy beyond politeness and respect wherein the neighbors are about to maliciously devastate the OP's family financial situation. Over some loud music and a rude look. Utterly insane, power-tripping, morally bankrupt BS. Whatever high ground they had in the \"be nice to your neighbors\" sweepstakes is now a valley in hell.", "Ok then but why is it completely up to her to bow down and show respect when they're not trying to show her any. I'm not seeing any indication that they ever tried to be civil with her.", "And how much do you want to bet that there was completely inappropriately language, blared at top volume at '9 or so' at night.", "Yep.  There are no winners here.", "As someone who grew up and lives near a rural community I can 100% believe that a rural person especially a farmer would stoop to this level of pettiness especially if the person is from \"the city\"\n\nI know many wonderful rural people but I also know many who's rural victim complex leads to petty and childish behaviour", "> What rational person would honestly believe that a person is doing all that just to spite them? You really buy that a grown-ass man with a farm is doing that?\n\nAs someone who grew up in a a rural community, do I believe a grown ass farmer would commit to this kind of undertaking to spite the city slickers who moved in next door and teach their daughter a \u201clesson?\u201d Yes, I 100% believe that is plausible. \n\nIf this is a true story, OP needs to be very careful before she can move out. A group of angry rednecks looking to knock an uppity city girl down a peg or two could do much much worse than build a pig barn if given half a chance.", "This guy is doing this to his neighbors because a teen girl challenged his authority and that can\u2019t stand. She must be shown what happens to little girls who don\u2019t respect their elders. \n\nYou probably read that and nodded along because you\u2019re cut from the same misogynist asshole cloth as the farmer here, and yeah, sounds like it\u2019s totally legal. It\u2019s also morally abhorrent.", "The pig farm's location in relation to the house OP lives in will drastically reduce the resale of the house and property.  From another comment OP made, the barn was planned already (except the placement of it), so the farmer isn't spending anything unexpected. He will also get a decent revenue from those pigs. OP's parents' house will continue to depreciate while the farmer makes more money. Right or wrong, OP's unwillingness to apologize has now affected her family financially long term, while the farmer continues to earn money..", "My guy it\u2019s a farm. Tons of farms keeps pigs because they make money. Farms typically don\u2019t put the barns for pigs on the property line because of the horrid smell. \n\nAll OP did was convince them to move the location, and she hosed her parents in the process.", "My understanding is it's anticipated to be a profitable investment anyways, it's just that I guess farmers don't typically do it out of respect for their neighbors or something, but now they've lost that with us?", "I totally agree. I'm all for protecting culture and values but it doesn't mean to can be a dick to other people.", "Sure 'late' is relative but what would the average person consider too late for music? At one point is it i think its kinda late but its still only 9 so il just deal. That being said also how loud was it that the neighbor was truly bothered?", "My guess is there is a lot more going on between OP and the neighbors than she is sharing. Lots of commenters have asked about them, but there are no responses to the info requests.", "Naw, that\u2019s how they ended it.", "I think you\u2019re joking, but the rural area I grew up in absolutely required burn permits for any open fires outside city limits for most of the year. You can thank, among other players, the logging industry.", "I grew up in a rural area and there are plenty of ways to fight back here, you just gotta be ready to go to the matt, which it sounds like they are not. Even if they have a burn ban, them putting it right by the property line gives you a lot of options. You are well within your legal rights to plant a ton of toxic plants right there or depending on their crops grow some really invasive plants that spread or use some deadly pesticides. But again, that\u2019s a call for total war", "Yeah, it absolutely does sound like a city-mouse country-mouse exercise, and specifically one where the writer expects the reader to feel torn because they feel like they ought to side with the city girl against the stinky redneck, but she\u2019s being so obnoxiously stupid it\u2019s hard to do so.", "My guess is that the rapidly glossed \u201carguments\u201d with the neighbors and their kids had something to do with calling them dumb hicks, and that\u2019s what the issue is, not one incident of rap music or dirty looks about a cow.", "Well it is for her parents - she'll be off to college or elsewhere soon. Hope the neighbours relent.", "\u201cI\u2019ll outsmart this dumbass redneck hicks\u201d ***redneck hicks proceed to legally build a pig barn on the property line and devalue her parents property by over 50%***", "Right?

She\u2019s 18 years old, old enough to hold a job, pay rent, enlist in the military, and vote.", "Again, assuming this is real, I\u2019m guessing that the rapidly glossed \u201csome arguments with some of them and their kids\u201d were more intense than \u201cwho\u2019s your favorite Avenger?\u201d or \u201cwe don\u2019t root for the same baseball team.\u201d\n\nEspecially if it\u2019s to do with classism.", "That's why you avoid arguing and escalation at all costs. When you wrestle with pigs both will get dirty. The difference is the pigs like it. She will get first hand experience now and it's too late to fix.

It's all gone because she felt entitled to be a jerk about their behavior.", "In conservative cultures, younger people are below older people in terms of respect. Children obey adults.

Seen it happen myself.", "By all standards she is actually an adult. I can't believe that she wasn't aware what living in the country near active farmland is going to be like. Her behavior might have been childish\u2026( though I am sensing \"missing missing reasons here) but her equally adult neighbor can do whatever he wants on his property. And if it drives his new neighbors and their pigheaded (pun intended) daughter out of their house\u2026 it's actually on her. Not on him.", "This is what OPs parents get for being cheapskates and moving to the sticks to save a buck. Rural communities can be absolutely vicious to outsiders. Give me a city where no one knows my name any day.", "I mean, the parents can get a nice big pig barn of their own to profit off of. It's the parents fault anyway for invading HeeHaw with their city kid.", "Based on your comments, you have no idea what hell you\u2019ve unleashed on yourself and your parents.", "Gee. I wonder whose fault is that? If you'd just apologized\u2026 He'd still probably put the building there but gave your family  some warning.", "Yeah don't talk to me about how stupid city people are and then cry about how people don't understand rural people and culture", "Exactly! I think that OP is downplaying this. I'm thinking that she played rap music in the driveway more than just once. Plus, I think you would have to be a huge asshole for other neighbors to start hearing about your antics.", "Yes my official determination is ESH, but also consider re-writing to lessen reliance on well-worn stereotypes and increase believability.", "Yep!! Had the exact same thoughts.", "Not just the smell but the sounds! Farm equipment is one thing, but a barn full of pigs is another problem altogether. Good luck to OP", "I see. Well, my father goes to work around that time (he isn't farmer tho. But works extremely hard) and I know that that type of schedule is very stressful and exhausting.

But it costs a lot of money...which they don't have. That's why they moved from the city to a rural community. Not only that, they likely lack knowledge of raising and maintaining pigs. OP was upset about a cow being in her yard. How is she going to handle pig slaughter?  And having a pig farm that size right next door?

Pigs *never* stop making noise.", "The farmer is not morally bankrupt for not getting rid of the pigs, after he already was getting them delivered, as it costs a lot of money to buy them and I guess the construction of their own was already built. It is expensive.", "It has nothing to do with age.  It has to do with maturity.", "> Rural areas can be great if you're mega conservative and fit in\n\nOr just friendly, open-minded, and considerate.
