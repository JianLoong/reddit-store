They divorced when we were young because he wasn't very good to her. About four years ago he got married again and 2 years ago he and his wife had a daughter together. It bothers my dad (and his wife to an extent) that we are not all about their daughter and that we act like she's different to us. She's so much younger which is a part of everything but the main thing is he wants us to be invested in her as much as we are with each other. He wants us to be those much older siblings who don't want to miss out on much. But none of us feel that way.\n\nShe got a small surgery recently and dad was so upset that none of us insisted on being at the hospital with them. It was not a serious surgery at all and she was home the same day. But it weighed on dad that none of us were like \"out of my way, we need to be there!!\"\n\nSo my siblings and I have this sibling trip planned that sort of coincides with celebrating me graduating high school. Dad heard about it and proposed a change of plans to us. He wanted to pay for all of us (the three of us, dad, his wife and their daughter) to go to Disney or Universal for a week and that we could spend time with our half sister as well and have sibling time with all true siblings, not just us older three.\n\nMy siblings were all auto no's but I couldn't reply straight away so dad thought he had a chance (when I say I couldn't reply, I mean the app on my phone was being weird) and he was then messaging me alone and saying how it would be a good thing and how we'd have those memories forever and if we could make a tradition of it and she (half sister) would always know her big siblings enjoyed having her around. When I could reply I did and turned down the offer as well. \n\nDad is pissed and said it's not every day kids our age get the offer for a vacation paid for by parents and even offered spending money. He said it's like we're determined to make it clear our half sister is not wanted and we'll be the reason we're not close as she gets older, not the age gap and not him or his wife.\n\nHe told me I was acting like a kid and not like a new adult.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687439314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g34pv/aita_for_turning_down_dads_offer_to_pay_for_a/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She always knew her siblings didn\u2019t care about her and how that hurt her as she grew up.", "NTA, I can understand your father wanting his kids to be close but it is unrealistic at this time. It's not like your half sibling is 12 or 13 where they can ride the rides with you and your other siblings. If that was the case I could see your dad's pov kinda. It's not a proper fun sibling trip lugging around a toddler and the entire trip revolves around nap time and diaper changes. Your half sibling is way too young currently to ride anything. Your not your siblings parents so why would you sign up to bring a young toddler on a trip? It makes zero sense. Plus out of the 3 of you someone would need to stand back and watch the toddler anytime you want to ride a ride it just doesn't make for a great experience for anyone at this age.", "Sorry your brothers treat you like that :( to not even go to your wedding? That's awful", ">It's not your sister's fault that she has a huge age gap.\n\n\n\nThese ADULTS are not close to their own father and you think they suck because these ADULTS don't have a relationship with a 2 year old? \n\nWhat exactly will that relationship look like- babysitting? Toys on birthdays? Teaching baby how to talk?", "OP also didn't do anything, literally- this child appeared in this world without any involvement or input from OP. It's totally not her task to ensure this baby's emotional development or any of her other needs. Also kids without older sibs/half sibs develop fine. \"Not being there\" for a relative does not a \"callous treatment\" make.", "Even if dad's paying for it between 18 to 23 who actually wants to deal with a 2 year old child at Disney or Universal? Now if the half sibling was 12 I could see your point. The trip with a 2 year old is going to involve maybe getting on a carousel and then dealing with a cranky toddler who needs diaper changes and naps so you can't enjoy the trip. Again as a sibling not sure why anyone would want to do that. Since all the other siblings are older and can ride all of the rides that would be more fun.", "Glad I'm not the only one who thought this.", " I had nieces and nephews with the same age gap and, while I love my nieces and nephews to the moon and back, there is no way I would enjoy a weeklong trip to Disney or Universal with a 2 year old. One day is hard enough, she won't be able to go on any rides you like, you won't be able to on any rides you like,,,", "UHM, wow. Okay. I'd like to state for the record I said soft ESH, so like, yeah dad was not great but OP also could handle the situation with a bit more grace. Maybe I was a bit harsh, but I stand by the fact that it's not their sister's fault she has a huge age gap. \n\nIt may be different and slightly more challenging than with their closer in age siblings, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't try and have a relationship with her. It doesn't have to be babysitting, but that's an option. I'm sure OP had instances growing up where their older siblings watched them. And going to a kids party and putting a name on a gift isn't difficult, and can mean a lot. Just because they might not consciously remember it later on doesn't mean their sister won't see pictures and know their older siblings made the effort. Honestly, I get the feeling that if OP said they wanted to get a gift for their younger sister but didn't have the money he'd probably buy it and let them put their name on it. \n\nI have cousins with huge 10+ years age gaps with their half siblings, but they still make the effort and have good close relationships with them. Sometimes it's nice to have another adult to go to, or have a younger person's perspective on something, whichever the case may be. \n\nAt the same time, they are adults and can make their own choices. I'm not going to say they can't, that would be absurd. I just think that if, for example, OPs parents had a brief/drunken/Ill advised one night reunion and that was what resulted in their baby sister, they'd have a much different perspective about having a relationship with said sibling than they do now, which isn't really fair to their sister, is it?", "> biological half sister is painfully aware not all relationships are the same though   \n  \nBull-fucking-shit. She\u2019s **2**, not 12.", "So speaking from experience, I started doing lawn care at 12. Until I was 32 the only vacation I had was when I quit my job and went and liven in the woods with hippies for a summer. Sometimes it was working 2 jobs and not being able to get approved leave from both jobs for a trip with friends. Other times my job just had no vacation time. Other points I just couldn't afford to go anywhere, or has used my vacation to cover being hospitalized. So my first real like took time off and planned something as an adult was my honeymoon. Since then I've also taken a family trip to Disney.", "[removed]", "Surely you can understand that there\u2019s a difference between a horribly traumatic experience like what you went through and a 2 year old who hasn\u2019t seen/heard/spoken to these half-siblings essentially since birth?", "[removed]", "> I was directly responding to the comment that toddlers don't have human feelings.   \n   \nPlease quote that comment, because it\u2019s not in this chain of comments.   \n   \nOP responded to your \u201cyou can\u2019t choose family\u201d comment with:   \n   \n> Not all relationships are the same though.  \n   \nTo which you replied that the 2 year old was \u201cpainfully aware that not all relationships are the same\u201d.
