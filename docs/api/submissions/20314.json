They divorced when we were young because he wasn't very good to her. About four years ago he got married again and 2 years ago he and his wife had a daughter together. It bothers my dad (and his wife to an extent) that we are not all about their daughter and that we act like she's different to us. She's so much younger which is a part of everything but the main thing is he wants us to be invested in her as much as we are with each other. He wants us to be those much older siblings who don't want to miss out on much. But none of us feel that way.\n\nShe got a small surgery recently and dad was so upset that none of us insisted on being at the hospital with them. It was not a serious surgery at all and she was home the same day. But it weighed on dad that none of us were like \"out of my way, we need to be there!!\"\n\nSo my siblings and I have this sibling trip planned that sort of coincides with celebrating me graduating high school. Dad heard about it and proposed a change of plans to us. He wanted to pay for all of us (the three of us, dad, his wife and their daughter) to go to Disney or Universal for a week and that we could spend time with our half sister as well and have sibling time with all true siblings, not just us older three.\n\nMy siblings were all auto no's but I couldn't reply straight away so dad thought he had a chance (when I say I couldn't reply, I mean the app on my phone was being weird) and he was then messaging me alone and saying how it would be a good thing and how we'd have those memories forever and if we could make a tradition of it and she (half sister) would always know her big siblings enjoyed having her around. When I could reply I did and turned down the offer as well. \n\nDad is pissed and said it's not every day kids our age get the offer for a vacation paid for by parents and even offered spending money. He said it's like we're determined to make it clear our half sister is not wanted and we'll be the reason we're not close as she gets older, not the age gap and not him or his wife.\n\nHe told me I was acting like a kid and not like a new adult.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687439314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g34pv/aita_for_turning_down_dads_offer_to_pay_for_a/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It just logically makes sense that as older children of divorce, you're not totally invested in the \"new life\" of your father and his wife.

I don't know how good your and your siblings' relationship is with your dad himself, but what you're describing from him is way more effort than I got from my own father, who married someone with children and treated them like his own while I got close to neglected (still traumatized by the time I was close to going abroad for a trip, but in the end, my mom couldn't afford it, and right after I found out I couldn't go, my father told me he was going to Disney with his family, that it was \"too late\" to take me, too, but didn't even offer any other solution, so I left in tears). \n\nAnyway, I guess I'm saying that depending on the reality of the situation and how you feel, maybe one day after your trip, give him a chance and spend some time with them.

By the time the kids old enough to question why she isn\u2019t as close to her half siblings, the obvious answer will be that they are fully grown adults and there will be no reason to assume a hurtful reason unless she\u2019s told. It\u2019s not going to harm the kid, and there is no obligation to have a relationship with someone just because your related.\n\n\nI think the world would be beautiful if everyone was full of love and acceptance and the older siblings showered their sister with love, but I don\u2019t think they are *wrong* or an asshole for not doing the hallmark movie ending.", "Uh huh. K. Sure. Is money an issue?", "There is a family relationship going on irregardless of feelings. This two year old exists and will enjoy being in an extended family that loves and supports her.

Why would you argue that things could be awful so the best plan is to keep things awful? That isn't advice. It's something darker.", "No, money is not an issue.", "\"You have to have the same deep loving relationship with this toddler decades younger than yourself as you have with your close-in-age siblings because FaMiLy!\" is frankly ridiculous. I do not relate to all my family members of all ages in the same way, or socialize with them in the same way. No one does. A two-year-old is not capable of the same sort of sibling relationship the adult sibs have with each other.\n\nShe would enjoy a loving supportive extended family- sure, and probably also a pony, but it is not OP's responsibility to provide either just because Daddy wants a new do-over family so he can pretend he didn't screw up his older kids' childhoods. And it is not fair to expect them to give up an adult sibling vacation to be, let's be honest, babysitters so Dad and his new wife can have a vacation from parenting their new shiny kid by dumping her on the older kids.\n\nAnd I have loved and cared for a lot of toddlers, some family and some not, but have never thought it was vile, hateful, or unreasonable to want an adult holiday with other adults. The kid won't even remember the vacation. And when she is old enough to enjoy vacations, it is her parents' job, not her adult siblings living independently, to take her on them. They're not living together. They're extended family, not nuclear.\n\nI got one road trip when I was nine with an extended family member - the one vacation of my entire childhood with someone outside of my immediate nuclear family. That relative, my aunt, also traveled extensively by herself and with other adults, as does my other aunt. My sister, now that we are adults, frequently travels with her husband, and I with my husband and child, without including each other. And yet there is great love and affection in my family, and I never considered any of them vile or hateful for not always or even frequently taking me on vacation.\n\nThis one- well, the young adults have not bonded with a toddler sibling, because they do not live together and are not close to their father or stepmom, and frankly have no common ground to bond on. This lack of closeness is not a sin, and if it is, it's at least as much their dad's fault as theirs. You can't neglect your first batch of kids, have a do-over sibling decades later, and then throw a tantrum when the kids you alienated don't want to jump right into playing Happy Families with your do-over.", "Not devoting a sizeable portion of your life to your estranged father's new family and child, so that he can feel like a proper parent again, is not awful or dark."]}
