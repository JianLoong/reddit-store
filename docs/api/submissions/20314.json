They divorced when we were young because he wasn't very good to her. About four years ago he got married again and 2 years ago he and his wife had a daughter together. It bothers my dad (and his wife to an extent) that we are not all about their daughter and that we act like she's different to us. She's so much younger which is a part of everything but the main thing is he wants us to be invested in her as much as we are with each other. He wants us to be those much older siblings who don't want to miss out on much. But none of us feel that way.\n\nShe got a small surgery recently and dad was so upset that none of us insisted on being at the hospital with them. It was not a serious surgery at all and she was home the same day. But it weighed on dad that none of us were like \"out of my way, we need to be there!!\"\n\nSo my siblings and I have this sibling trip planned that sort of coincides with celebrating me graduating high school. Dad heard about it and proposed a change of plans to us. He wanted to pay for all of us (the three of us, dad, his wife and their daughter) to go to Disney or Universal for a week and that we could spend time with our half sister as well and have sibling time with all true siblings, not just us older three.\n\nMy siblings were all auto no's but I couldn't reply straight away so dad thought he had a chance (when I say I couldn't reply, I mean the app on my phone was being weird) and he was then messaging me alone and saying how it would be a good thing and how we'd have those memories forever and if we could make a tradition of it and she (half sister) would always know her big siblings enjoyed having her around. When I could reply I did and turned down the offer as well. \n\nDad is pissed and said it's not every day kids our age get the offer for a vacation paid for by parents and even offered spending money. He said it's like we're determined to make it clear our half sister is not wanted and we'll be the reason we're not close as she gets older, not the age gap and not him or his wife.\n\nHe told me I was acting like a kid and not like a new adult.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687439314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g34pv/aita_for_turning_down_dads_offer_to_pay_for_a/", "score": 886, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your not your siblings parents so why would you sign up to bring a young toddler on a trip? It makes zero sense.

It doesn't have to be babysitting, but that's an option. I'm sure OP had instances growing up where their older siblings watched them. And going to a kids party and putting a name on a gift isn't difficult, and can mean a lot.

It's easier than most trips but still a lot of work.  My other son is only 4 years older and there were still lots of things that big brother wanted to do that little brother can't do.  Plus little brother needed a nap and big brother didn't.\n\nHow much is your dad going to expect you and your siblings to bend to the understandable needs of a 2-year-old? Will he get upset when y'all elect to go to Epcot so the older siblings can drink around the world while they ride It's a Small World and go back to the hotel for nap time?  Will y'all be expected to take family photos at princess meet and greets instead of riding roller coasters? Will he hold the fact that he paid for it over your heads when y'all want to go off and do something more age appropriate?\n\nI think it's a nightmare waiting to happen.", "The youngest could be the parent too.   \n\n/my one grandma was a granny at 33.", "Agreed", "THIS. If he truly wanted to be supportive, and has that kind of cash to throw around, he could pay for the older sibling's trip, as well as take the whole extended family out for a nice lunch and a trip to an aquarium or something. The 2 year old wouldn't know any different, would probably have a better experience, and it would even cost less money overall.", "I'm also curious how close the dad is in age to wife #2, and if he's really trying to defend that *she feels left out of the older sibs bonding. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40", "No shade, but at 51 you're likely to be closer in age to the dad than OP, and you might be missing the point that OP and their two older siblings were to be having a \"rite of passage\" \"coming of age\" sort of trip, which is wildly different than being in a supervised environment with their parent who seems insistent that they center his new child in ways that may not be possible for them.", "OMG she\u2019s a literal TODDLER. It would be stupid to take her to Disney right now no matter what the circumstances. She won\u2019t remember jack shit. It sounds like new wife is pissed everything is not about her and her spawn and threatening to dump Dad. Totally NTA.", "I may get flamed for this but a week long 'vacation' at an amusement park for people in the age group of you and your siblings doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me.  Some people may think it's a great idea but NTAH.", "NTA. \n\nFunny how your father claims that you are acting like a kid but he is the one throwing a tantrum.", "Good lord. I have a 14mo daughter and the thought of taking her to disney anytime in the next few years stresses me out. She won't remember any vacations for at least a few years. Bringing a kid under 5 to Disney is a waste of money, especially since it's so much more expensive now than it used to be. Also, most importantly, where the hell is she going to nap? Are you all going to have to leave Disney, go to the room, and come back at least once a day? Or just have a 2yo getting shut eye for a few minutes at a time leaving her cranky all day? He hasn't thought this through at all.", "NTA", "r/modern_family there is a script here waiting to be acted involving jay Gloria Joe manny Claire and mitch\n\nNTA btw", "NTA, but why can't you do both?", "I don\u2019t know how rate this I guess nah..  But she is a little child. Would it hurt you to have some empathy and visit her or talk to her?   Send her a stuffy after her surgery maybe?  Don\u2019t go on the Disney trip but maybe suggest a day at the zoo or the children\u2019s museum.   You may end up liking this little kid.", "Am I just not awake enough, or is this kid two years old?\n\nWhen they're old enough to actually remember things, your dad can suggest this again. NTA.", "NTA. The only thing you have in common with the baby is your father\u2019s ejaculatory contribution.  \n\nGiven the age of your sister, your father would be in his 40s.  He may be going to the baby\u2019s high school graduation on a walker or in a wheelchair.", "Wonder what your dad was doing and feeling when he was the ages of his adult children?", "> I understand that he's desperate to bring all his kids together but with the huge difference in ages, I don't think he's being realistic. \n\nI also wonder if he even has the cash for this kind of trip. We've seen a lot of instances of people trying to convince others to cancel plans, for *better* plans. Only for those better plans to never materialize.", "It\u2019s also going to make the trip revolve around the toddler \u2014 and this is supposed to be OP\u2019s HS graduation celebration.", "And I can see the joint family trip being a nightmare. Dad doesn't want the adult kids to be able to hang out without the baby. \n\n\"Oh, you can't go on any of the rides except *Dumbo*, *Peter Pan*, and (horrors!) *It's a Small World*, because baby sister will be scared or can't go on any of the rest. You all have to stay and bond with us!\"", "It sounds like it\u2019s OP\u2019s father who is pushing the \u201call or nothing\u201d choice, replacing their original trip with the one he wants. Maybe they have limited availability (like time off already booked for the older sibs), but the way it\u2019s put it sounds like their father specifically doesn\u2019t want them doing things as siblings if the toddler isn\u2019t part of it. And that\u2019s ridiculous, because the toddler would have to be the focus due to how young she is. Everything would have to be limited by what she can do. These are adults; they will have other things they want to do together. Plus this is OP\u2019s graduation celebration trip! It shouldn\u2019t revolve around a 2yo.\n\nI agree with your suggestion, which strikes a good balance, but I think that the father won\u2019t go for it. Which is a shame, because if he makes it all-or-nothing he\u2019s going to get nothing.", "He wants you three to have that closeness with her, yes...  \n\nSO THAT he & the new wife can get some alone time with \"free babysitting\" rotating across the three of you. The closer you are to this new littler human the more quickly you would say yes to watching her for them (without any real compensation).  \n\nNTA, just say no.", "So true!!! They think it\u2019s water under the bridge while everyone else deals with the consequences forever!", "And I think that up until recently, most people have been \u201cforgive and forget\u201d about these things. It doesn\u2019t work that way. People can\u2019t flip things on and off like that and why the hell should they be expected too?", "That is fine as a parent.  Your oldest 15 and when your youngest was 6.  Big difference that a group from 18-23 wanting to celebrate the 18-year-olds HS graduation as a first adult group vacation.  Now they are having dad and his wife trying to shove their toddler down their throats.  To top it off dad was not part of this planning and now is telling them they are horrible because his toddler should be center stage in every breath they take.", "I get that. That\u2019s why I think they should have their own trip and ALSO have the family trip. When I was 16 my parents adopted an infant. I went on family trips with them and the baby and also did my own thing without them. I was agreeing with someone who suggested they still take their trip but then also do a family trip.", "Yes but when I was 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 I went to Disneyland with my parents and their son they adopted when I was 16.  I\u2019m saying they could do both trips. A shorter family trip and their longer sibling trip.", "The key word is YOUR PARNETS.  This is not thier mother, they are not close to her or their father.", "It sounds like you had a healthy relationship with your family. That's great. Unfortunately as OP has mentioned, their father treated them & their mother poorly in the past, and has attempted to do a \"wipe the slate clean\" situation with the new wife. He's upset his adult children won't get on board to validate him/new wife/ new baby. \n\nYour situation was radically different, as it was your own parents who adopted an infant, and also sounds like allowed you some freedom while they parented the child. OPs dad sounds like he wants to cash in on free childcare under the guise of \"sibling bonding\", while also not making real efforts to right his past wrongs. \n\nHappy for you, but I believe your lived experience was considerably different than OPs here, and therefore the circumstances surrounding the hypothetical trip are considerably different.", "READ HOW HE TREATS THEM VS THE HALF SISTER.  To him their only job in life is to kiss the ground this kid walks on.  They could care less about the kid, him or his wife.  Why waste their time when they do not want to be around it.", "I guess I don\u2019t get why they can\u2019t try to be a family. My father in law remarried and brought in a bunch of kids were not related to and we have family gatherings to get to know each other. I\u2019d want to do both trips especially at that age. A cool no parent trip and a family trip. I wasn\u2019t expecting my parents to adopt a baby when I was 16 (they actually foster parented him when I was 16 and he was two months old then adopted him a couple years later) and it meant I needed to babysit (I was the youngest so never had any responsibility for a younger child before) and I didn\u2019t resent him or them.", "I didn\u2019t read that he mistreated them. OP said he wasn\u2019t good to the mom but wasn\u2019t clear what that meant. Maybe there are more details in the comments I missed. As posted the OP doesn\u2019t say he mistreated them.", "I have read it. It doesn\u2019t sound like he mistreats them in favor of the toddler. It just sounds like he wants them to care about her as their half sister. Maybe there is more in the comments and I didn\u2019t see those. I don\u2019t see an issue with wanting all of your children to be part of the family.", "It's in comments. \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA. And I'm saying this as someone who has a 1 year old and two much older stepkids (more or less Ops age). \n\nFirst of all a family trip to Disney with a toddler isn't going to be the same kind of trip as \"omg OP is an adult now let's go have some FUN\"\n\nWhat your father wants is unreasonable. Most older teens and early 20s are super busy. And just aren't going to want to be all up in toddler time. What he's doing is ruining any chance that OP and their older siblings will want anything to do with his youngest later. \n\nI mean really my oldest stepkid LOVES kids. But she's booked solid almost constantly.", "I could understand tou not taking the trip, but you guts should have went to the hospital,  or got her a get well gift. I know it is day surgery.  Day surgery still huge the little kids. My daughter had a surgery on her knees a few times. It's not all peaches and cream. The little kid is a little kid and should get some love from our servants at least from that. No one comes to your graduation if you want to have a blow out with your siblings,  go for it. I can understand if you want to keep that kid free. Do the vacation later with them ifyou want.", "NTA. You have your trip planned. He made an offer you turned it down. You can't live out his fantasies just because he wants you to.", "NTA\n\nHe's not offering you a vacation, he's signing you up for an unpaid babysitting service for your graduation. There is no reason to drag a two year old to Disney. A good age would be seven or eight, so she would remember it when she grows up, but you can see what his motives are, clearly. \n\nThis is supposed to be a fun trip to celebrate with adult siblings and your mom who raised you. This is not the celebration of your dad and stepmom having a child free vacation. \n\nYou might want to take a few steps back from dad. If you have already, take a few more, lol. Congrats on your graduation.", "Right? Dad kinda reeks of mid-life crisis energy to me too, personally \ud83d\ude2c", "Out of curiosity OP, how old is his new wife? /How close or far away is everyone in age from each other?", "Lmao. My nephews screamed for days as bored toddlers in the park.", "Or they could just do what they want and their father could respect their right to make their own choices.", "They ARE a family. There is no reason that refusing to babysit their halfsibling and miss the fun rides on op's graduation trip means they aren't family. NOT EVERY SINGLE THING AT DISNEY IS TODDLER FRIENDLY. EVERY SINGLE EVENT IN THE FAMILY DOES NOT HAVE TO BE CENTERED AROUND A TWO YEAR OLD, WHO IS NOT GRADUATION AND WON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. \n\nIt's nice you enjoyed your events with your children, siblings, grandchildren, etc. OP doesn't share those feelings because SHE HAS NO CHILDREN AND DOES NOT WANT HER PARTY USURPED BY A TODDLER.\n\nHer father is clearly obsessed with his second chance replacement daughter and is trying to push everyone else to feel the same, which ALWAYS has the opposite effect. \n\nThe best thing for him to do would be to listen to what's being said, and schedule some time when it's more appropriate, for visits with his kids for one on one when they have time, and to be clear it is not for babysitting, it's an entire family visit. Somehow I don't think that's what this is what is intended in this instance."]}
