It will take them at least twelve hours to get home. \n\nWhile I would love to see my sister I can't change the dates I put in for vacation and our rental is already booked up until a couple of days before our stay and they require the unit to be empty for at least 24 hours for cleaning between stays.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1690105124, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157afrq/aita_for_refusing_to_change_my_vacation_schedule/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m actually here to talk about your cats. You may already know this but just in case. My husband and I moved 4 hrs away last yr and had to drive our 4 previously traumatized rescue cats (also abandoned and worse). Our vet gave us a prescription of \u201cGabapentin\u201d to ease their anxiety. It was an amazing gift. Usually my cats are so stressed out and vocal in the car. This time they were mellow and chill and didn\u2019t seem that affected by the ride. We also used it during some loud construction when they had to be confined to a room. It really is the difference between them being miserable or not. If you decide to go this route I would suggest doing a practice dose at home to see how they react. Nothing bad Just one  of mine slept for an entire day after her first dose so now we half it. She\u2019s very small and delicate.\n\nAnyway, I hope that you have an amazing time meeting your grandmother and that it\u2019s a beautiful time for the rest of your family, Especially your mother!", ">I put in for the dates I was given and then my sister (46 f) told me that the reunion was happening a few days before that \n\nInfo: Given by whom?

It sounds as if this trip was for your mom's family to meet HER mom's family. It's weird that your sister wants to change the dates so she can have \"special time\" with your mom and you. \n\nIt could be a power play. Your sister feels powerful when she can make others inconvenience themselves at her request. Her feelings of power and control are more important to her than what you and your mom think, feel and want. \n\nYour mom's tendency seems to be to \"make everyone happy\" by trying to accommodate your sister's \"me first\" demands. Healthy boundaries belong in EVERY relationship. It's okay to say \"no\" to changing plans. The trick is to stick to your boundary and resist invitations to be further pressured to violate it. Don't defend or explain. Stick with \"we're arriving on (date) and leaving (date).\" If your sister makes plans that differ from the group, there's no obligation for the group to bend to her unilateral change."]}
