YTA^2 .", "You\u2019re just flat out dumb man I hate to say it. No one else will. 21 hours sitting in an airport? Have you ever sat in airport anywhere close to this long? You have 5 days and one day is gone? Does that make any sense at all? If money is this tight in your eyes you should really just be taking a trip somewhere you can drive.", "YTA-unless you plan on sleeping in the airport, you\u2019ll have to stay somewhere and then there\u2019s food. You might not end up saving a lot of money anyways.", "YTA\n\nIt would be safe and common sense to assume that you would have consulted her about a 21 hour layover before buying those tickets. Yes, you are saving $400 in theory. Except you aren't. You will now need to pay for a hotel, meals, and transportation in Dallas. Maybe going out to pass the time? So how much are you really saving? My guess is $100 or less. \n\nYou didn't think this through. If this layover is happening both ways, you've now lost 2-3 days minimum from your trip. Nobody wants to spend time traveling for 26 hours when they could be at their destination in 8 hours or less. You're not flying from the US to Australia. You're not even leaving the country. Yeah, I'd be pissed at you too.\n\nYour vacation is 5 days and you'll be spending half of it in Dallas and in airports instead of LA. Does that make sense to you?", "YTA\n\nA 21 hour layover is a big deal. You should have discussed it with her first. The good news: She won't put you in charge of travel plans again.", "YTA - that is a big difference in layover time. i hope this isn\u2019t a vacation, as you are wasting about a day of it in the airport.   \n\n\nPlus that $200 savings is going to be eaten into paying for food and such during said layover.", "YTA-you can be cheap, but not 21 hours layover cheap. Not all airports have restaurants and stores. They definitely do not have beds for layovers either. You\u2019re spending more money because you\u2019re now going to have to pay for a hotel, to sleep, and bath and even eat. You should\u2019ve definitely talked to your GF about this regardless if you\u2019re paying or not. Good luck sleeping in the airport , cause you most definitely won\u2019t. Lights, announcements, people, sleeping in chairs. If you needed the extra money, you could\u2019ve at least asked her , or asked her if she can borrow, you could\u2019ve asked someone to borrow, and did you even think about how you\u2019re cutting your vacation time also with this ? You\u2019re wasting a whole day, and spending more money cause I\u2019m betting she is not going to spend the day/night at the airport. All you\u2019re luggage, is going where ever they put it to load the plane, so now, you\u2019re gonna need a change of clothes and your carry on is going to weigh more and you\u2019ll have to pay for that too.

Especially since in your comments your plan is to just hang out at the airport for 21 hours. In 21 hours in Dallas you could explore sites, get a hotel room, make dinner plans etc. Where do you plan to sleep during that time?", "YTA.  Should have discussed the layover first and made sure she was cool with that.  \n\nAlso you just might spend $400 during that layover so net savings will be lower.", "INFO: what do you plan to do for 21 hours in Dallas?", ">I didn't consult with my GF as she put me in charge of doing this.\n\nINFO: As in she was basically like \"do whatever you want\"? Why didn't you check with her anyway since it' such a long layover? Also, time is money; so was the 21 hours worth saving $200 anyway?", "info: have you ever done a long layover like this before?\n\nBecause I think you are massively underestimating how much this is going to cost you and how horrible it's going to be.", "YTA. There are a lot of decisions you can make on your own when booking travel, but you cannot spring on your travel partner a 21-hour layover. You have to make sure they're okay with that. That's 21 hours of her life she'll never get back.", "YTA. The amount of time being saved versus the cost. You are going to need to eat and drink. Factor that in. Also sleep deprived. When you finally land will you have the energy to do anything.", "You\u2019re killing me Smalls. Are you FOR REAL? Um you needed to get with your girl on that one. Nobody likes that kind of $hitty long horrible trip. Not only was it a 21 hour layover but let\u2019s not forget the original travel time, being 2 hours early to the airport. Now you need to buy let\u2019s say a breakfast, lunch and dinner for 2. And breakfast the next day. And you\u2019re exhausted and she\u2019s pissed. Where are you winning dude???", "YTA so I don\u2019t get how you\u2019re saving $200 with the 21 hour layover\u2026.because now you\u2019ll need a hotel room for the night, plus Uber fees and food\u2026you\u2019re basically going to lose money on this layover idea AND it\u2019s eating into your vacation time.", "YTA. JFC, what a horrible itinerary. Plus flying the two shittiest airlines.", "YTA. A 21 hour layover is ridiculous. You might want to try calling the airline to see if you can rearrange the flights to a more reasonable trip otherwise you might find the price of the trip also included your relationship.", "YTA for not checking with her first. Most of us don\u2019t have unlimited time to take a vacation so that layover is most likely cutting into the actual vacation time. Plus you will be exhausted when you arrive from the extended travel time.", "YTA - sounds like weaponized incompetence to me. A full day's worth of airport meals for two will eat up a fair bit of that \"savings\". You'll also find that most airport seating is not very good for sleeping, assuming they let you stay airside overnight. They may make you leave the secure area entirely. You two are likely to be very tired by the time you reach your destination.", "Id NEVR make you in charge of something this important.\n\nWhat were you thinking?\n\nYou will need a hotel or was your plan to sleep in the airport?\n\nI only get so many days off so 26 hours of layover is a entire day of vacation wasted on nothing.\n\nThe only way you can ever hope to save this is to leave the airport and make a day/night out on the town.  I hope you like Dallas...  Sorry but YTA", "Yes, YTA.  In some cases, you can't stay over at an airport.  I believe two celebs (Kristin Bell?) recently got kicked out of an airport because the waiting area was closing.", "Did you take into account that Frontier and Spirit have a lot of additional fees for carry on luggage?", "YTA. \n\n  \nI hope you have something awesome to do for 15 of those hours in Dallas \u2026 you have priced a day of your vacation with her at $200 each\u2026 and wasted it.", "YTA. A 21 hrs layover? It normally takes 4-5 hrs for a flight. Hope it\u2019s your ex by now. If this is an intentionally display of weaponized incompetence, you are still a major AH.", "YTA. A 21 hour layover is going to prove to be expensive. Not necessarily the full difference in price, depending on how you're going to handle it, but still expensive. 2 legs? Eh, it's whatever. But your time and your sanity are worth avoiding a 21 hour layover.", "Yeah, you didn't think this through. YTA. You looked at the total price of the ticket without actually looking at how long it took to get there. Where are you going to stay for those 21 hours. You'll need to sleep. Hotel room? How much is that going to be? Sounds like you're going to be spending more for that 21 hour layover than for the full tickets without taking a day trip and making it two.", "YTA.\n\nThat\u2019s absolutely not a reasonable itinerary. \n\nIt means you have to probably stay overnight and spend money in Dallas, so the idea you\u2019re saving $400 gets quickly erased by the extra day. It\u2019s also an extra day you\u2019re not getting in LA, where your gf expects to be traveling to.\n\nTo be honest I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to break up with someone over this. I would be absolutely LIVID to spend literally half my vacation in an airport / a city I didn\u2019t plan on being in. \n\nTo be honest LA is also an expensive city \u2014 if money was so important I would think there would be superior options that would be enjoyable where money would go far.", "YTA that is literally almost an entire day!!!! I'd be pretty furious too!", "If i was your girlfriend, you'd be wasting a whole lot more than 21 hours of your life. I would not be going on that trip. I did a 5 hour layover in Qatar once, and never again will i spend that much time in an airport.", "YTA. WTF are you going to do for 21 hours? Besides, if you are looking at Frontier and Spirit you should also consider the Greyhound bus. Hopefully, your GF dumps you.", "INFO: are you planning on sleeping in the airport? How much did this $150 difference make, then, if you are in a hotel or getting food at least twice in an airport bc of the 21 hour layover? Did you know that Spirit airlines have additional fees that ppl are commonly charged that makes flying that airline just as or more expensive?", "$11/hour. Seem worth it?", "YTA.  What do you expect her to do during this 21 hour layover?", "Spirit and frontier, OMG. You will be lucky if you get on any of these flights without issues.\nYTA, so much.\nI would rebook my flight or not go. 21! Hours.", "YTA.\n\nYou say in the comments that this is your vacation, and you're not even doing anything during the layover, you plan to just stay at the airport for 21 hours doing nothing so you're losing a day of vacation to save $200.\n\nIf money is that tight you just can't afford the vacation at all, better off staying home and going out on the town.", "OMG, is this a joke? Of course YTA if this is real. I\u2019ve been married for 25 years and the best way to figure out if I\u2019m TA isn\u2019t to ask Reddit, it\u2019s to listen to my wife when she tells me I\u2019m TA. Best to learn this valuable lesson now and hopefully it will sink in by the time you find your next girlfriend.", "Time is more precious than money. I\u2019d be livid if I was her.", "It\u2019s insane.  26 hours?  Have you lost you mind?  And you lose a full day!! And what about the return trip?  This is insanity.  YTA and an idiot", "YTA\n\nNobody wants to spend 26 hours to travel only halfway across the country. That's just insane.", "YTA. \n\n21 hours in an airport with nowhere safe or comfortable to rest, a 5 day trip now having one of those days eaten by what? Waiting. Just waiting. Not even exploring because that costs money! Just waiting. \n\nI understand your reasoning but let\u2019s just think here\u2026\n\n\u2022You\u2019re on about pre-packing food so you won\u2019t just go and hang out at a bar/restaurant to kill time - at least not right away and if you do it\u2019s going to be \u201ctepid water please.\u201d \n\u2022You\u2019re not booking a hotel so will have to just find random benches to lie down on - if anything - depending on how busy it may get, but they\u2019re also not exactly comfortable or conducive to good rest. Tired people become agitated people. \n\u2022You\u2019re hoping to save as much money as possible so that rules out the desire to even window shop because you\u2019re most likely going to complain if spending of money does happen at the airport vs at your destination. \n\u2022An argument will most likely ensue, if not at the very least having barbed chit chat that gets more snippy as time slowly wears on, therefore causing a dampener to be put on things before you even arrive. \n\u2022And then to top it all off, once you finally arrive at your destination you\u2019re both going to be cranky and exhausted and in no mood to really do much so it\u2019s either force yourselves to go and stick to whatever plan you have or say screw it and rest - and then you have to hope that an argument doesn\u2019t happen about losing more precious time because you\u2019re playing catch up with said exhaustion and your body needing an actual bed to lie down on. \n\nYou are barely saving anything and now it\u2019s going to be torture. Absolute torture. Now factor in a pissed off girlfriend ruminating over how little you\u2019ve actually saved. \n\nI\u2019ve done ridiculously long layovers and in all honesty, with that in mind, I wouldn\u2019t even want to go anymore if I were her. \n\nYou could\u2019ve chosen to save money in other ways or at least had the discussion with her first. I know she asked you to handle it but with long layovers you really should be communicating this first before booking anything. \n\nGood luck. You\u2019re gonna need it.", "Info: What will you be doing with the long layover? Do you have friends in the area to visit, or any tourist sites you want to see and maybe have a nice nap in a motel and a swim in a pool? Perhaps you can turn an annoyance into an adventure?\n\nBe aware that Spirit is a no-frills (or basic standard amenities) airline. My information may be outdated since it is many years old, but they had very kind and helpful employees, more things to clean than they had people to do it, and absolutely everything cost an extra fee. For example, they charged for carryon luggage.", "YTA", "YTA", "[removed]", "YTA you could have taken the bus or rented a car for the same price.", "YTA\n\n...you're going to spend a good chunk of the savings on food and drinks at the airport, plus a 21-hour layover, without a hotel for the night? That sounds like an absolutely awful nightmare.", "YTA, 21 hours is ridiculous. You\u2019re going to have to get a hotel which doesn\u2019t save money. \n\nIf you\u2019re expecting her to forgo a hotel and camp at the airport for 21 hours you\u2019re a MAJOR GIGANTIC ASSHOLE.", "YTA and I\u2019d be angry too. That\u2019s a ridiculous way to plan a flight. And when it involves someone else, they should always have a say in it before booking. If you don\u2019t have the money to fly comfortably now wait until you do.", "Lmao yeah, YTA, might as well hitchhike at that point", "YTA - that is a massive layover. Definitely needed to consult and agree on such an issue. \n\nThis is a case of penny wise pound foolish. By the time you take into account the expense for meals etc at the airport the savings diminish further. Not to mention the lost time that could have been enjoyed at the actual destination.", "YTA. A 21 hour layover is hell on earth and not even that cost effective. You will end up spending a fair amount of money during the layover.\n\nSuch an inconvenient trip should have been cleared with her. I would just stay home if this is the only way to get some where. I don't know if you've ever done a trip like that but it really is miserable.", "Yep. You saved $200 per ticket  but you\u2019re flying an airline that charges for carry on luggage. You get one small personal item like a small backpack or large purse and that\u2019s it. A checked bag at the airport is $89. \n\nNow you have 20 hours to kill in the airport. If you actually stay there, you need at least three meals. Airport food is expensive so figure another $70 to $100ish for two people. \n\nYou may have appeared to saved money on the surface but you really aren\u2019t. Next time, think thoroughly before committing to a \u2018deal\u2019 like this.", "YTA - you're pennywise but pound foolish!", "I can only hope that you are still a teenager or early 20s with very limited or no real world travel experience which might explain a blunder of this magnitude. Nevertheless, YTA.", "YTA. \n\nI had to look up what the flight time for that is, and you messed up so badly. \n\nThat kind of layover only makes sense for an international flight, where you plan to go and see some sights in the area while you wait. \n\nBalancing expenses and comfort is important, and you managed to not do both. Not only have you cut into your vacation time needlessly, and frustrated your girlfriend. You are probably going to end up spending more money than you saved. \n\nThere\u2019s enough time for two meals each, and snacks at the airport.

A checked bag for spirit is $50 minimum, depending on when you buy it, but DTW\u2014>DFW and DTW->DFW->LAX would both be $50. I believe frontier is the same. So if you\u2019re flying both airlines there, you\u2019ll spend an extra $50 on baggage (if you\u2019re only bringing one suitcase).", "Only the cheap airlines have baggage fees for carry ons, Most decent airplanes allow for free carryons.", "That's just horrible, better to stay home", "You're going to pack enough food for six full meals and snacks for two adults for a full day?\n\nDo you have any idea how much space that is going to take away from your carry-ons?\n\nI'm going to ask this again: what is the longest layover you've done before?", "I refuse to believe anybody is this dumb.", "The airport doesn't own the restaurants and shops.

Frontier has a history of telling people their carry-ons are to big or weigh to much and making you pay $100 to check them once you're at the airport. You are going to have to be very careful in what you're packing.\n\nOnce you factor in everything you'll need for the trip, you'll likely have enough room for a few snacks but not enough for full meals.\n\nWhat type of food did you plan to pack that would cover that much food and time?", "Have you every actually gone on vacation before? There is no way you can pack for a five day trip plus enough meals for 21 hours in the airport in a carry on. Oh plus entertainment like books, electronics etc. It won't happen.

For united, I know the carryon policy is different for each despite both having a basic economy.
