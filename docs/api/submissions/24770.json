Shaving your WHOLE body is in fact a chore and heaven forbid you have shitty hot water that runs out after five minutes in the shower. It\u2019s not the same as just washing your body or hair, and it grows back so fast.

NTA\n\nI still shave my armpits because I really dislike the view of hair there. But my wife can do whatever she like. So she doesn't do a lot too. I like her more clean shaved, but that is just something i like. But even if I would go back to shave myself every few days, that would still not something she should do because of that.

If he is going to act like this now he is going to act like this forever unless he chooses not to, shaving, vacations, drinking, you name it if he has a opinion on it clearly he'll share it regardless of your feelings.

There\u2019s no way you shaved your armpits, legs, balls and ass crack in that time XD Thats not even including a beard or chest because women don\u2019t tend to shave there or arms because not everyone does that. (I don\u2019t shave my arms). So it might take longer if those things are being shaved too. \n\nRegardless, it\u2019s not about whether it\u2019s effort for him, it\u2019s him saying it\u2019s not effort for her.

He sucks.", "There's definitely an asshole here; it's the boyfriend.\n\nThe issue is that he's completely disregarding the effort (and the discomfort of ingrown hairs) that she goes through every 2 weeks for his pleasure.\n\nThe thing is that you don't just give it a quick shave, you spend 20-40 minutes shaving everything, then you clean off, then you spend another 15 minutes moisturising everywhere to try and prevent ingrown hairs, but you have to moisturise again every day for at least a few days.\n\nAll in all, you're looking at about 1.5-2 hours of effort, getting into cramped positions, and risking cutting very delicate parts of your body.\n\nHis complete ignorance and disregard for that is what makes him an asshole.", "I am totally open to suggestions. It was just frustrating to be told the effort I put in *for him* is expected but not appreciated. \n\nI tried talking to him several times, but that didn't help.

Have you ever considered that maybe you're too hung up on outdated beauty standards?", "I don\u2019t know about you, but most men actually have hair on our legs.  If I were to shave both my legs from hip to ankle, that would probably take 30 minutes.", "Somebody had to say it.. \n\nI agree with you on this.

It's possible that even if he did shave all over, it'd feel low-effort to him.
