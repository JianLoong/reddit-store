The family members that don\u2019t have any kids are not involved, it\u2019s something just between the ones that do.\n\nThe situation started when my cousin Hanna (15F) was finally old enough to participate, her mom was saying how excited she was about the party and how it would be Hanna\u2019s first sleepover. \n\nThe problem is that me and my cousins are all teens and it is known by every one of our parents that we stay up all night drinking and listening to loud music. \n\nWhen Hanna turned 15 we stayed the night at her house for the tradition and it was not fun at all. Hanna is autistic, which makes her sensible to loud sounds and she can get overstimulated very easily. Most of the times when that happens she starts screaming and crying. \n\nWhen my aunt came to me talking about how excited she was about leaving my cousin in my house for the sleepover I tried telling her, along with my other cousins, that we didn\u2019t feel comfortable having Hanna overnight. We tried explaining that a bunch of kids should not be responsible for taking care of someones life, especially drunk ones with no adults around. \n\nShe tried debating with us saying that she never has any alone time and needed a night for herself, bc Hanna is a full time job. Me and my cousins kept disagreeing with her so she started screaming about how me and my cousins were discriminating on her daughter.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do, my dad, her brother, is trying to make the situation better by inviting Hanna to come in another night when they are home so she can have some alone time, but my aunt isn\u2019t answering any of his texts. It\u2019s been almost a week since all of this happened and I\u2019m regretting telling Hanna she couldn\u2019t participate because every since my family has been arguing a lot about stopping this tradition.\n\nI understand that my aunt only wanted her daughter to be included in something fun, but I still don\u2019t think it would be safe.\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole?", "created_utc": 1685300382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13u8615/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_she_cant_come_to_my/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agree with your dad's proposed solution.  The last thing you want is an autistic CHILD partying with a bunch of other drunk CHILDREN and something goes wrong.  It could go very, very bad.", "NTA I understand how they\u2019d want her to join you but it\u2019s not there decision to make", "NTA A BIRTHDAY IS NOT THE TIME TO BABYSIT", "NTA. It's not about your aunt wanting Hanna to be included or her being upset if Hanna isn't included. This is about your aunt thinking of her own wants. I get that it's difficult for your aunt taking care of Hanna all the time. But that is what parenting is about for a kid with autism such as Hanna. She can't stand noises, gets overestimulated easily, which is what will undoubtedly happen at this sleepover. Auntie needs to understand that Hanna is her responsibility and she needs to research alternative care options so that she can have some free time. That's not your job.", "NTA you shouldn't have to babysit someone who is \"a full time job\" during your party that you are hosting. You want to have fun not work. Your aunt can hire a specialist babysitter or someone for her child if she wants time off", "NTA.  The party would have been overstimulating for her, as shown by what happened in the past.  The offer to have a separate party for her was a nice compromise.", "Seeing the situation, NTA. I would never leave my autistic kid alone with a bunch of drunk teens. I think your father's solution makes sense, this is your birthday and you shouldn't have your day ruined due to someone else's mental health issue. It is not like you don't want to hang out with her at all, you are fine doing it on a day when your parents are there.", "NTA\n\nI know what carer burnout feels like, but your aunt is still being an asshole. Her solution to carer burnout should not be pushing the responsibility onto children. Especially drunk teens, my god.\n\nIf she was doing this for Hanna, then she would have jumped on the compromise. It would be ideal to have a situation where Hanna can join in, but be safe if/when she gets over stimulated. Shame aunt is being difficult because she's only making things difficult for all the kids.\n\n*^spelling", "NTA\n\nI saw the title and was going to put YTA, but two things made me change my mind:\n\n>She tried debating with us saying that she never has any alone time and needed a night for herself, bc Hanna is a full time job\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I understand that my aunt only wanted her daughter to be included in something fun, but I still don\u2019t think it would be safe.\n\nThat first thing up there... that's the heart of the situation.  Hanna's mother is trying to gaslight you with the second thing there because she wants a night of, let's call it \"free babysitting\".  That there's a party there is a bonus.\n\nIf Hanna can't handle the usual event, it seems pretty unreasonable to me to force everyone else to deal with it.  OTOH, it would be nice if Hanna could be included in other activities.\n\nThe real issue is that mom is pissed she can't get a night on the town, and is trying to put the blame on a kid having a birthday.", "NTA. \n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can let your Aunt know what the party will be like (with alcohol and loud music) and let her know that this will not be changing for Hanna\u2019s comfort. Hanna can come with an adult in charge of watching her, and deal with the environment, or not come at all.", "NTA. You are not a respite service, and if having Hannah is a full-time job then it is not something that is appropriate to expect of teenagers who are trying to have a party.\n\nAs an autistic person myself, it doesn't actually sound like you are saying that she can't come because she's autistic. You are saying that she can't come because she has needs that you cannot meet. She could be neurotypical with needs you couldn't meet or she could be autistic and be fine in a sleepover.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Many people on the spectrum are fully functioning and take care of themselves. Obviously Hannah requires much more attention than these kids should be expected to provide. NTA. \nHowever, I have serious reservations about a bunch of teenagers left home alone to get drunk and party on. What the hell is wrong with these parents??", "ESH, you less so since you aren\u2019t an adult and you are correct in saying that with you guys knowing what can cause meltdowns will most likely happen, you are also right in saying that if a meltdown were to happen you guys as aren\u2019t fit to take care of her. Plus it\u2019s your party so your rules, from my point of view it\u2019s just an asshole decision but I am bias bc I am also autistic and it sucks being the only one missing out when it\u2019s not something you can truly control.\n\nYour cousins parent however is the bigger asshole here for the way she reacted, both towards you and how she talked about her own daughter. In my opinion this conversation could have been easier if she didn\u2019t react the way she did. \n\nThere are solutions where your cousin could join in, such as a room for her if she needs to decompress or just go away from everything that is happening. And some other stuff between her and her parents that can be set up so your cousin also can enjoy the party without any impactful changes to this tradition. \n\nAnd while I see this situation as everyone sucks it doesn\u2019t mean that your reasoning behind why you don\u2019t want her to come isn\u2019t understandable, it just means it\u2019s a bit of an asshole move to specifically exclude her. And lastly, it mainly means the adults around you are the bigger assholes, especially your cousins mom who should know that you can\u2019t just dump an autistic person at a social gathering without any form of plan for how things can go. \n\nBut your cousin isn\u2019t some kid, she is 15, she is aware of her triggers, she can plan around it as best as she can and is she has a meltdown depending on how big it is you won\u2019t even notice it or it will be noticeable. \n\nWhat I am trying to say is the best option at this point is to sit down with your cousin and talk about it. First without grownups, try to measure out how existed she is about some parts but less about others, this can be used to your advantage as it creates a natural downtime when your cousin has time to rest. Then bring it up to your parents, since all the kids are gonna get drunk I assume they aren\u2019t too far away, which your cousin can use if everything gets too much and she needs to leave. \n\nI swear this is the last part, no matter what decision you make, neither of them makes you a bad person. And from my experiences of being drunk and on the spectrum (this also goes for everyone in my friend group as we are all autistic), you don\u2019t really get overstimulated in the moment, it\u2019s instead for me like a form of hangover the next day. I\u2019m very sorry if this is confusing, I am actually hungover right now bc I drank yesterday and my brain hasn\u2019t started focusing yet. English isn\u2019t my first language either, but if anything is unclear or you want to talk about the situation just respond and I\u2019ll do my best to give a more comprehensive and hopefully shorter text.", "ESH - I get the point you all were trying to make but you went about this very wrong!\nI\u2018ll attribute this to your age as you seem to lack proper politeness to tackle an issue as delicate as this one.\n\nYou should have warned your aunt about the way these parties usually work and ask her to talk to your cousin if she things she can handle it. \nThe way you went about it you give the impression that you really dislike spending time with your cousins and want to avoid her like the plague\u2026. that makes YTA. \nBut your aunt is also at fault provided she knows how these parties work because she is forcing a different behaviour onto you kids which is unfair (the said truth is autistic kids have it very hard and there isn\u2019t much you can do about it).\nStill I understand where she is coming from.\n\nMy suggestion is to make 2 parties one civilised to include your cousin and one just for you teens  to go ham.", "NTA", "Parties all night whenever a cousin has a birthday. Sucks for the autistic cousin, who's always uncomfortable or left out. Has an opportunity to do something nice for the cousin, have ONE PARTY that's fun for her. But no. Fuck her. Autistic people are party poopers and why even have a party at all if it's gonna be autistic.\n\nYeah, YTA.", "NTA. \"Taking care of Hanna is a full time job for me, her parent and an ADULT, so I need a bunch of drunk teens to do it so I can have a break\" ...no.  That's not safe, unfair to Hanna, who it sounds like would have a terrible time, and unfair to you when you are supposed to be having a birthday party and not worrying about keeping your cousin safe.", "NTA. But also wtf is wrong with your family that y\u2019all are drinking at that age with permission? Jesus  Christ", "YTA", "I mean the family is already totally fine with a bunch of children getting wasted unsupervised and home alone... because that can't go wrong just in itself at all!\n\nThe mum is the asshole and should have explained to the girl why she may not go, not have the much-more-sensible teens point out that the noise and drunkenness would be overwhelming and they would be unable to care for her and wouldn't have an adult present.\n\nThough OP is TA for complaining the autistic girl's sleepover was no fun. She can't help she's autistic and if they already feel they need to get wild to have fun that's a problem in itself.", "It would make more sense to do that for Hanna's birthday. They can all make her birthday the way she wants it.\n\nNo sense making OPs birthday about someone else.", "Why does someone have to sacrifice their birthday party so the autistic kid can get overstimulated, scream and ruin the whole event?\n\nFace facts -at this point in time the  autistic kid IS a party pooper.\n\nShe may mature out of it as so many do - just slower than her cousins or she may not at all - but whatever - that time has not yet come just because she has technically reached the same age as the NT kids. That\u2019s a pain but its a fact and no-one is entitled to extra special ruin someone else\u2019s birthday party powers just because they are ND\n\nThey already all went to a party she was at AND offered an alternative event that would be more suited.", "This is a terrible take. Why on earth should someone else sacrifice their own party for the comfort of someone else. Especially when the sacrifices made are going to make the event unenjoyable for anyone participating except the one person? She had her own party. Had it her way and everyone hated it. She doesn't get to control how other people spend their own birthdays. NTA at all.", "The solution was to have a party that Hanna could attend at a later time when there was more supervision and support for Hanna's needs. Hanna's mother said \"Hanna is a full time job\" that party with all 15/16yr olds with zero adults certainly sounds like the place for someone that an adult can barely accommodate.\n\nNo one in the is post said autistic people shouldn't have fun or fuck her. Just that Hannas needs cannot be met by a group of drunk 16yr olds... Assuming this is a country with a low or non existent drinking age.", "16 isn't that low, and i don't think the legality of it impacts Hannahs ability to be accommodated by those drunk teens."]}
