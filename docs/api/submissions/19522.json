You're right, Mom, I don't care about the family, and I find talking to you painful, because you insist on grilling me about things I'm not interested in talking about. NTA.", "Nah it\u2019s perfectly normal", "Can you not tell her the reason you don't call? You're a strong, independent woman and she still treats you like a child. You're NTA. You're doing great", "I think being honest and telling her (or texting her) the reasons why you don\u2019t want to call. I understand about toxic parents, but as a mom, I\u2019d want to know how my child felt or why\u2026instead of feeling ghosted. If she can\u2019t do better after that, then limiting your calls is for the best. NTA", "Nah nobody's an asshole.  But when she dies you will regret it.  You will be sorry you didn't talk to your mom more.  Believe me. I've been there.  My mom is dead. I did talk to her quite a bit before she died but for a period of my life I just couldn't be bothered that much.  The second your mom dies is the second she becomes the person you want to call most.  Don't be silly.  Call your mom.  Be friendly. Make her know she's loved and you're living a good life. You will never regret being kind.", "'She wants me to initiate the call instead, saying that if I asked her to do the asking, that means I don't care about the family'\n\nWell, she's not wrong. She has picked up on the fact that you find talking to her a chore, and rather than change the behaviours from herself which *make* it a chore, she has decided she wants proof from you that you still love her.\n\nSo, NTA. However, if it helps, my mother was a similar person, and I found that once I initiated telling her I loved her, she backed off a surprising amount. Might be worth trying.", "I didn't include this in the main post due to character limit, but I did lay out the details to her on what time I'll be available for calls, amount of times we can call in a week, and so on. She refused to accept that and waved it off.", "I used to tell her before, but nowadays I don't since she still keeps on being so obtuse.\n\nThanks for the kind words!", "I did tell her before and basically being honest to her on why I just don't like calling her, hoping that she'd understand. But she just flat out refused to listen or understand, and that kept on repeating again and again until I just gave up and not wanting to do that again.", "Dear OP, I am so sorry that you have to deal with a toxic mother and you are NTA for doing what is right for you. You establishing boundaries does not make you a bad child\n\nYou wrote that - \"The most common question is: \"do you have a boyfriend yet?\" I really don't like this question, and there was this one time where I snapped and told her I don't like being asked these questions. But she wouldn't stop and kept on saying that women my age don't have much time left, and she asked that because she cares! Nevermind the countless amount of times I told her that I'm not interested in such things\" which I am terribly sorry what you have to face.\n\nNo disrespect towards your mother but when she keeps asking you that question that is NOT caring or loving at all. It is intrusive on her part and the way she does it truly belittles you as a person whose achievements as a functional and contributing member of society. If I am your friend or older relative, I'd have a serious word with her to back off and stop treating you as an extension of herself\n\nI am not going to tell you to disown your mother as this is none of my business. BUT here is what I suggest as below on how to limit your calls with her:\n\n1. If you do not want her to call you, put your mobile phone on 'Do Not Disturb' mode. You decide when to talk to her and she needs to learn to give you space\n\n2. If she keeps at calling you and asking you non-stop whether you have a boyfriend, you can end the call by saying \"Mother, look I gotta go. Talk another time. Bye!\" or \"I am not gonna talk so bye\". You are the owner of your own phone and you get the right to decide to end it. It may be scary but she needs to learn that it is not okay of her to cross the line on respect and boundaries\n\n3. If mother keeps doing it non-stop, you can try blocking her temporarily for a few days or shut your phone for a few hours a day. OR you can buy a prepaid/burner phone where you can transfer your other friends' and colleagues' number on it or put her number there (it is entirely up to you and I have friends who done that all to get peace and quiet)\n\nIf you feel not confident doing it, I encourage you to practice in front of a mirror or roleplay with a close friend to help you boost up your assertive side", "I don\u2019t mean to belabor the point ? But I\u2019m wondering if you took charge and said \u201c mom I have 15 minutes every Friday morning available to call you to catch up \u2026\u201d might appease her because you\u2019re calling and would also appease you because you have some control ?", "That's ok. You're entirely right. Happy to DM if you wanna discuss.", "Well, then, she\u2019s been forewarned\u2026but, would you honestly be fine chatting once a week if she was more pleasant? I look back in hindsight (since my mom died) and realize I passed so many chances to just talk with her bc I just really didn\u2019t feel like it.", "Thank you for the advice and your kind words! It feels really good to know that me setting boundaries and being assertive with parents is not wrong at all. I will definitely note down your advice and start implementing them :)", "Ahh sorry, I read your reply wrong before, my bad! \n\nI did do that before, but it wasn't consistent. She would say she's busy, or she would ask to call at night which would interfere with the plan I have already made. And when I rescheduled, she didn't pick up at the rescheduled time.", "I honestly would love to talk more to my mom, since I see my friends can get along so well with their parents and I really want that as well. But it's really hard since I always have to hide most parts of myself while talking with her. \n\nI did a mistake of telling her what I have been up to without hiding anything because I was just so excited to tell her, but she focused on the detail of me going out late at night and yelled at me for that. Same thing happened when I broke up with my ex. From what she said to me, it's as if she was blaming me for the break up. So yeah, remembering those just made it more painful tbh.", "OP it is no problem. I get where you are coming from as I have known a few people in your situation and I would do my best to try helping people like you. \n\nRemember to tell yourself daily to be proud of your achievements and success as a human being. Remember the people in your social and work circle who respect you for your personality and your work ethic. If your mother cannot see that, remind yourself that it is pitiful that she is too blind to recognise you are more than just marriage material as society sees more women are contributors to the workforce. Tell yourself you are a successful person where the sky is the limit\n\nDo give us all an update how it goes", "As a mother of adult children ? I would recommend setting the boundary and if she misses out on the time ? She misses out ? You just have to stick to your boundaries? I get the feeling you love your mom - she\u2019s just too overbearing .", "I see, she\u2019s being very judgmental and you are a full grown adult. I understand where you\u2019re coming from. Maybe she\u2019ll get the picture if you continue to have little contact. I know I\u2019d do anything my son asked if my behavior was making him not want to speak to me! Good luck!", "She's way too overbearing and just plain out doesn't respect the boundaries I have set. So now I just refuse to call her at all. It's just too stressful :(", "Man, I wish she has the same mindset as yours, to be honest...\n\nThank you!", "That\u2019s  a reasonable boundary . But again , it sounds like you care ? So I would tell her that you need some time out - she\u2019s too much and you\u2019re going NC for a while ?", "Yep, I'm going NC for a while!", "Bravo OP! Going NC temporarily would be the balm you need. All the best", "Thank you!"]}
