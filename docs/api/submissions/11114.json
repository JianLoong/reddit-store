She drove me to from my surgery today. We stopped at the store when we were headed home and got me one of those chair looking pillows so I could be comfortable trying to lay in bed. She has been very helpful except for this evening and when I told her I was in too much pain to climb up into our bed. Our bed sits very high off of the ground and it would be very hard for me to get in and out of bed. I\u2019m also having a hard time sleeping so I do not want to keep her up all night with me. So I\u2019ve been in the recliner in the living room and I\u2019ve told her all day I think it would be easier if I just sleep when I can right here tonight. She started acting like she was mad at me around 7:30. Wouldn\u2019t come talk to me or anything. I sent her a text telling her I\u2019m sorry I can sleep in the bed tonight because I\u2019m hurting. She said she wasn\u2019t mad and I didn\u2019t need to apologize. Well I fell asleep and woke up to her standing next to me in the recliner trying to get into my phone? I\u2019m not sure what she was doing or why she was doing that. I have never done anything for her to not trust me. So then she tries to play it off and starts asking me why I jumped when I woke up. Like seriously I was sleep and I woke up in a dark room to someone standing right next to me. Of course that\u2019s going to scare me. Anyways so she goes back to bed and send me a text saying \u201cSo happy I spent $20 on a pillow so you could lay in this bed. Nothing I ever do is enough and it shows.\u201d She frequently says stuff like this and I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m always telling her thank you and being appreciative towards her.

I\u2019m honestly shocked that people like your gf exist tbh. You just had f***ing surgery. You\u2019re in pain. PERIOD. No further explanation needed. She is abnormally selfish and her behavior is concerning.", "Nta but I'd rethink the relationship.\nShe is clearly insecure and inconsiderate.", "Ffs, i haven't been to sleep in my bed for over a week now due to having had hip replacement surgery.\n\nIf anyone were to complain about it,  i'd need to assume their empathy was screwed up.\n\nNTA and from one recliner sleeper to another,  i hope you feel better really soon.", "Definitely NTA. In fact, I would take the complete inability to accept your limitations due to a relatively major surgery as a reason not to climb, or even lie flat as a red flag in this relationship. For the record, I slept on a first floor couch for almost a week after my gall bladder surgery, for the same reasons you listed. I got nothing but support for these decisions because I had an understanding partner. Maybe let her return the pillow if that is such an issue.", "NTA. I had my gallbladder out back in 95 and I still remember how sore my abdomen was even though it's 3 tiny holes. Definitely don't blame you for crashing where you are. I had so much guilt with mine because I had a 1yr old at home and I couldn't hold her for almost a week I was so sore. I was tossing cats off right and left but explain to a baby why Mommy can't cuddle. \n\nTake it easy and feel better soon.", "NTA. Wtf is wrong with her??", "NTA. Her behavior goes beyond inconsiderate. If she was trying to go through your phone, there are only 3 possibilities: 1) She\u2019s incredibly insecure and probably needs time alone to work on herself 2) you are cheating and she senses it 3) She is cheating and looking for reasons to be upset at you or accuse you out of guilt. None of those 3 possibilities are great. You probably need to re-evaluate your relationship.", "NTA. I hope you are seeing these huge red flags she is waving. I had gallbladder surgery and my husband slept on the couch for two weeks. Even longer when I had other surgeries.  Your gf is being selfish and inconsiderate maybe even abusive because you are in such pain. You aren\u2019t able to rest properly with her behavior. Can you ask someone else to help you?", "NTA people who have just had major medical procedures should be allowed and encouraged to sleep wherever and however they want.", "NTA. You say she\u2019s 28, but I still feel compelled to ask what grade she\u2019s in. She behaves like a petulant toddler who can\u2019t grasp real life issues. Wow. I hope you feel better soon and heal up quickly. Good luck.", "You\u2019re NTA at all. \n\nIf it were me, I would have slept on the couch in case you needed something in the middle of the night. You might need crackers to take pain meds, could be groggy from pain meds and need help getting up. That\u2019s just me.\n\nYeah,  I know people will say you could call on cellphone, but it\u2019s not the same. Hope you recover quickly!", "NTA but she surely is", "NTA\n\nUpdate your phone security - more complex password and turn off face recognition. \n\nTake a very hard think about your relationship. You have plenty of time to sit and think right now. Something is clearly not adding up. When you are better, have a discussion about EVERYTHING.", "She 28 or turning 8? Cause her behavior is immature. NTA", "NTA that is some passive aggressive behaviour, man.  \nAnd the trying to scoop your phone, waking you up, then saying you were jumpy? Uh...  \nThose aren't stellar traits.", "NTA, she\u2019s 28 FFS get over it. It isn\u2019t like you do this all the you are in pain AND SHE SAID IT WAS FINE. She needs to grow up and she\u2019s the AH. \n\nEdit read something wrong", "NTA - I had mine out a decade ago. A night in the hospital, and found myself with a \u201cfriend\u201d that had to stay in me for 3 days (a silicone drain). I couldn\u2019t have co-slept even if I\u2019d wanted to. Tugs on the drain felt disconcerting, strange, and emotionally uncomfortable. It was like having parasite sucking on my guts. \n\nYou had something major happen to you. And your gf is making it about her. Her attempt to get to your phone makes me wonder if she suspects cute nurses from the hospital are texting you. Which really is crazy. And until she has a surgery like that herself, she\u2019s not going to understand how not-sexy you feel. You feel like a medical \u201cthing\u201d instead of a person.\n\nHelpful tips: when you eat, be near an accessible bathroom. Don\u2019t do restaurants for at least a month. You need to be close to a toilet. It\u2019s going to take a few mistakes here and there, and you will want the bathroom close. Overeating is no longer a thing for you for a long time. You will know real quick if you do it. Everything will suddenly try to exit out the back end. Also, red meat is going to be harder to process. It won\u2019t feel good. Eat a lot less of it from now on. A few ounces of wine with meal is helpful for digestion. Make up a little for the bile store you\u2019ve lost. Doesn\u2019t mean to chug a bottle. Just a small glass.\n\nBest wishes, OP!", "NTA. Many people use a recliner after surgery because it is more comfortable. If it hurts to get in and out out of a bed what do you do when you need to use the bathroom?   \nShe sounds a little clingy but you could say the pillow was very considerate and the money was not wasted bc you can use it later to read in bed.", "NTA anytime I\u2019m sick I prefer to sleep in a recliner and my husband respects that.", "I just read that headline and have to say no and you're in a toxic relationship situation when you've just had surgery and someone is putting you in danger", "NTA but by the last comment seems as if she is insecure and has trust issues. Happy healing", "Nta. I had my Gallbladder removed and slept in a chair when I got home. I was actually ket overnight after mine and i  just had a few small incisions. It's sore and uncomfortable the pump air into your abdomen to see everything better I cant imagine trying to sleep flat in a bed after that or even just slightly elevated. Hell I had a spinal fusion where they went through my lower abdomen and slept in a recliner for over 2 months. All my husband said was he missed sleeping next to me. I understood that I missed it too. If he pulled that shit he would have spent the next few months in the recliner.\nYou just had surgery right now its anyway you can get comfortable.  I honestly feel like something else is going on with your gf because her reaction is so over the top. You need to rest and recover. All of which I hope you do quickly and feel better soon. Just remember if this is how she's acting when your not 100 is this really someone you want to have your back or trust to. Best wishes.", "Definitely NTA. I know the pain all too well.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this! The first couple days after gallbladder surgery can be rough, because they don\u2019t often give you any pain relief afterwards (I got regular Tylenol and something for \u201cbreakthrough pain\u201d- ha!).  Recliners are great places to recover. NTA.\n\nThe phone is a definite issue to be tackled when you\u2019re feeling better. Same with any other relationship issues- long-term, they could be a problem. Hope you\u2019re feeling better soon!", "NTA. She's insecure, and projecting in a major way while trying to access your phone?  Cheaters often do this to justify their behavior to themselves. Red Flag factory here. Heal up and leave!", "NTA sorry that you have to go through this nonsense when you aren't feeling well.", "NTA and it sounds like your gf could use therapy. My narcissistic mom would do stuff like this too, in her mind me being sick (aka you post surgery) is a chance for her to play the healer and for me to be ever so thankful for all of her kindness. If your gf is like that too, it sounds like maybe you weren\u2019t playing into the wounded animal narrative and she was getting upset. Definitely would recommend therapy for the gf.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Why did she pay for the pillow?", "NTA at all, but as someone who can get weirdly insecure and clingy sometimes in response to imagined rejection may I suggest saying you miss her, and asking her if she'd come lay on the couch in the living room and keep you company? You haven't done anything even remotely wrong, nor given her a reason to be insecure or feel rejected, but it sounds like her brain is being a jerk to her anyways, and that will probably defuse the situation.", "Yes for sure NTA. OP may need to rethink the relationship", "Yes she does. We just got into a huge argument yesterday over my kids. I feel as if she has to have some kind of conflict in her life. I left my last relationship over constant conflict. And she know that. This was supposed to be different \ud83d\ude14 I\u2019m so upset.", "The pillow was very considerate!

If I was thinking straight I would have told her to take my card.", "Ugh I can\u2019t stand people who need to make things an issue.

NTA", "NTA. I slept in an electric recliner for a month after surgery. I tore a stitch trying to get out of bed the first night after surgery. Your GF is cray cray and you need to rethink a few things", "NTA she is mad you won't sleep in the bed after surgery. She starts acting suspicious trying to take your phone then sends passive aggressive texts. That is not a normal reaction to someone's loved one who has had surgery. I was in hospital for a whole week after my gallbladder surgery. She lacks empathy and is selfish, concerned with her own feelings only.", "NTA. My mother was like this. Everything was about her. She was so long-suffering and self-sacrificial and no one was ever appreciative enough.\n\nIn your wife\u2019s mind, you should\u2019ve tried to climb into bed no matter how much pain you were in to show your gratitude. Then, seeing how much pain you were in, she would\u2019ve said \u201cOh no, sweetie, don\u2019t hurt yourself. Let me help you to the recliner.\u201d\n\nThe outcome would\u2019ve been the same, but her ego would\u2019ve been sufficiently (for now) stroked.

You know your own limitations and what you can and can\u2019t handle. \nI had my gallbladder taken out in 2021. The worst part for me was the ride home and the shoulder gas pain. I was able to bend over and clean the house that same day (against my bf wishes) but I still laid in bed most of the next two days and slept. My bf didn\u2019t expect anything of me during my recovery. \nShe sounds very insecure if she\u2019s getting mad for you not sleeping next to her every single night. And very manipulative with her comments. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA. \n\nWow holy shit your girlfriend is an insecure child. When I had my gallbladder out I couldn't lay in bed either. Spent a lot of time sitting upright or at a steep incline waiting for the abdominal wall to heal up.  The sheer lack of empathy from your girlfriend is astounding. Fortunately for me, my wife is a generous and understanding partner who knows that post-op recovery is painful and exhausting. \n\nWishing you a speedy and thorough recovery OP. If you have to cough, hug a pillow. It'll help with the pain. Mind your diet in the coming months. It's going to be a rough ride getting things stabilized. I promise the digestion issues improve eventually.", "What am I reading here? I had my gallbladder removed 13 years ago. I was allowed to leave the hospital after 5 days and getting out of bed was painful for almost 2 weeks. After three weeks I was allowed to work again and it still hurt sometimes.\nEverytime you need to get up it will be painful and it will last. So your gf needs a reality check and read some ppl experiences after that kind of surgery. You cannot and should not lift anything for minimum of three weeks, no exercise etc. You are NTA, she clearly had good in mind but getting up from a high bed is hell! No pillow in the world will help you with that. \nTry to roll on your side, take one leg first, get up very slowly and then put the next leg down. That was the most comftable way for me getting up.\nWishing you a speedy recovery!", "To be fair all we know about the girlfriend and their relationship is this one instance and OP's perspective (and only what OP tells us). Judging by this alone, they're NTA but you're way too harsh as we don't know everything that's going on. Maybe OP cheats on her and she has suspicions (not saying they do but relationship problems are usually about more than just one thing)\n\nEdit: changed OP's pronouns to gender neutral", "Hope you feel better soon too\n\nalso to OP. This behaviour is concerning from your gf. NTA, wish you a speedy recovery", "It's not his job to pacify someone's insecurities! Get a self-help book, listen to a podcast or get a therapist. That's a you problem", "You said she does this regularly? It's not gonna stop. I was dating the sweetest woman, but any time I did anything that was just for myself she'd hit me with the \"I guess we're just not at the level I thought we were, which is fine, I'll just change my expectations.\" Regardless of what you do for her on the regular, any time you have to do something for you, this will happen. Run. She's incredibly immature and selfish for her age.", "NTA.\n\nYou know, the old clich\u00e9 is that married men are supposed to live longer.  Not sure that would be the case with your girlfriend, tbh.", "Nta of course. She sounds like someone who goes out of her way to see slights where someone else is just being normal but not wanting to do it her way or not giving her enough attention. Exhausting.", "I think it's best to get a better girlfriend..", "I\u2019m not harsh. At all. He just had major surgery. It\u2019s during those hard times of either illness, surgery, or major life change that you see the true color of people who say they care about you.  No matter the circumstances, this isn\u2019t the appropriate time to address anything other than making sure that person is comfortable and in the least pain as possible. To me, if you can\u2019t put yourself in your partners shoes after major surgery for whatever reason, and don\u2019t care about them anymore- then yes, it\u2019s concerning. She should have left him then. But she\u2019s there now and she\u2019s the person he expected to care for him during his time of recovery. He could have made other arrangements.", "Yeah I definitely don\u2019t cheat. She\u2019s the one who lied in the beginning of our relationship and was seeing someone else while also seeing me. Anyways we are past that now. Also I confronted her this morning and she said she came to check on my and my phone went off so she was making sure it wasn\u2019t one of my family members checking on me. Could be the truth but could be a lie. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Wtf is this take??", "Ahh reddit, where conclusions are jumped to from miles away."]}
