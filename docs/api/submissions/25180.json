Most people aren\u2019t asked to be a in a bridal party until early 20s. \n\n- You assumed your daughter wouldn\u2019t like it because you don\u2019t see her as the \u201cgirly type\u201d when plenty of women who don\u2019t fit your narrow view are excited and happy to be involved in weddings and have a special role. \n\n- Perhaps the worst of all of is you telling her to choose your niece for her looks and aesthetics.

I have seen SO many different untraditional themes people choose to suit their personalities from Halloween, Gatsby, tropical, circus, boho, country, casual, etc. and not all of those are necessarily \"girly.\" Men are also in weddings, so this point makes no sense.\n\nDid you even ask your daughter if being a bridesmaid was something she would be interested in?

Maybe.\n\nIf your advice was based on the honest belief that your niece would enjoy the experience more than your daughter would then you would have been right to suggest her (morally right that is, even if you were factually wrong).  To recommend your daughter even though you thought the niece would have enjoyed it more would just be nepotism (ironic though that word is in this case).\n\nHowever, bringing attractiveness into is it definitely AH territory.  And one does also wonder whether your theory that the niece would enjoy it more is based on your own stereotypes and biases rather than an honest understanding of their personalities.\n\nSo to summarise - I don\u2019t think you should automatically give your daughter preferential treatment over your niece, but I do find your attitude to societal norms concerning.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I didn\u2019t have a say in what clothes I bought until I started working and making my own money. I started wearing skirts and dresses and my mom was like ???? And didn\u2019t get that I just flat out hated the clothes she bought me. They looked bad on me.", "No, that\u2019s not the activity. I haven\u2019t seen or worn any particularly frilly bridesmaids dresses.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not girly, but I sure do enjoy dressing up for special occasions. Yes, in girly dresses. Everyday activities are not weddings.", "I wasn\u2019t into that when I was that age, and I have no idea how I\u2019d feel if I was asked to do so. But I\u2019d also appreciate being asked and allowed to decline.", "If done honestly, hiding selfishness behind feigned thoughtfulness is toxicity manifest though.", "I'm 41 and was a bridesmaid for the first time this year.  I also figured I wouldn't be one, but you never know.  Assuming it's something you would like to do.  Not everyone does.", "This is the story of so many teenage girls, me included.", "I don\u2019t really enjoy wearing dresses but I absolutely would dress the part for a bridesmaid role without any complaints.", "Ah, maybe a cultural thing then. In the US I\u2019ve seen a handful of junior bridesmaids, but it\u2019s mostly a lot of women in their 20s or 30\u2019s, the bride\u2019s friends. They\u2019re expected to help set up wedding adjacent events, pay for the bachelorette and their own dresses/hair/makeup/nails, run errands for the bride day of, and are usually the only ones invited to the bachelorette party.", "That's fair. Tbh, from the responses, it seems my experience is definitely not the norm in the UK either \ud83d\ude05 Though, I'm pretty sure bridesmaids here aren't expected to do all of what you described there. The hen do is definitely opened up to more than just the bridal party, same with the grooms stag do, that's opened to more than just his wedding party"]}
