Most people aren\u2019t asked to be a in a bridal party until early 20s. \n\n- You assumed your daughter wouldn\u2019t like it because you don\u2019t see her as the \u201cgirly type\u201d when plenty of women who don\u2019t fit your narrow view are excited and happy to be involved in weddings and have a special role. \n\n- Perhaps the worst of all of is you telling her to choose your niece for her looks and aesthetics.

I have seen SO many different untraditional themes people choose to suit their personalities from Halloween, Gatsby, tropical, circus, boho, country, casual, etc. and not all of those are necessarily \"girly.\" Men are also in weddings, so this point makes no sense.\n\nDid you even ask your daughter if being a bridesmaid was something she would be interested in?

Maybe.\n\nIf your advice was based on the honest belief that your niece would enjoy the experience more than your daughter would then you would have been right to suggest her (morally right that is, even if you were factually wrong).  To recommend your daughter even though you thought the niece would have enjoyed it more would just be nepotism (ironic though that word is in this case).\n\nHowever, bringing attractiveness into is it definitely AH territory.  And one does also wonder whether your theory that the niece would enjoy it more is based on your own stereotypes and biases rather than an honest understanding of their personalities.\n\nSo to summarise - I don\u2019t think you should automatically give your daughter preferential treatment over your niece, but I do find your attitude to societal norms concerning.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
