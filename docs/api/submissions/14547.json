I met everyone there. \n\nThe 2 other women told me it was \u201cgutsy\u201d to wear what I was wearing. I was wearing a rather athletic bikini. The bottom was full coverage and was almost like shorts, and the top resembled a sports bra more than anything else. \n\nThe other 2 women told me that I should be old enough to know that was stupid.

Swimsuit covers exist for a reason. Would you show up to lunch in your sports bra and underwear? Vacation or not, wear clothes to a lunch my lord.\n\nEdit again- I understand she was wearing a cover.

These are your work colleagues and keeping a mostly professional vibe should always be expected even when doing \"offsite\" events.

But then your coworkers might be thinking about you wearing string bikini from now on even when you're in the office.\n\nI'm not saying what you wore is inappropriate because (gasp!) midriff!

We all act a bit more conservatively when around coworkers and showing up to lunch in a bathing suit and coverup when everyone else is going to be fully dressed is a bad look.

What you described sounded totally ok for lounging by the pool but I would have put on a coverup before meeting them at the restaurant\u2026   Waltzing up to lunch in a bikini when no one else is even wearing a swim suit would be a little off putting.", "Yep.

This Winter, our org and some other high performers plus our spouses were treated by our CEO to a long weekend in Hawaii, all expenses paid.

From what you described, it sounds like your swimsuit was totally appropriate and you should be able to wear what you feel comfortable in. Don't let their comments get you down - wear whatever swimsuit makes you feel most comfortable, and enjoy your time by the pool! Also, maybe it's time to speak to HR about harassment. What they said to you was totally inappropriate. I would feel horrendous going back into a workplace where I was spoken to like that by colleagues.", "NTA but depending on the workplace, maybe not the best choice as far as matching work culture. I\u2019ve had friends work at small family businesses and the company cookout is a big party and it would blend to wear a bikini.

Second, what you're describing is the exact outfit that I think is a bit much in the gym (like, Planet Fitness, not a resort gym), but I see it all the time so it's not like it's wildly sexual. You were at the pool by yourself and then met them at the poolside restaurant where you covered yourself up. \n\nHowever, I have also worked in small agency environments before, and I do think there is a chance that there is more to the story here.

Which honestly depends on what your coworkers were wearing. If the women were in one-pieces and/or the men were in swim trunks, I think your swimsuit + cover-up is fine for lunch.

Rolling up to a table and then taking out your cover up and putting it on at the table before you sit down is just...weird. Even if you had on a neck to ankle bodysuit!\n\nYour coworkers are right in that the manner in which you called attention to yourself might have consequences for you because it is just kind if weird to stroll up to the table in your bikini, whip out your wrap, and put it on as people are greeting you as you sit down. I accept this may not have been attention seeking behavior on your part but it certainly may read like that to the room.  I suspect that one of the guys who walked into the restaurant in his speedo and waited until he was at the table to get out his pants and shirt to put them on would get the exact same sort of wtf reaction.\n\nBut whatever, in the grand scheme of things I think you could have done a lot worse.  Once at a company party I saw an employee doing body shots with the assistant manager's husband when they were both drunk as skunks.

Women wear sports bras at the workplace gym all the time...   \n\n\nI would never do it because I lack the body and work in tech so I have tried very hard my whole career to be as androgynous as possible.  I had hoped that wouldn't be necessary for the younger generations of professional woman.", "NTA", "NTA.  If you'd said you wore a string bikini with a thong bottom then yes, I'd say that would make you TA.  But a sports style with shorts style bottoms?  No way.", "NTA.  As you can see, folks will judge you but that is there issue. Most women can rock a bikini for only so long, so enjoy it!  Don\u2019t let the prudes get you down .. from a 60+ year old woman who rocked a bikini for only about 2 years and supports all women\u2019s rights to dress as the please. Best to you!", "NTA, these comments are fucking horrendous fr", "NTA. You were wearing a swimsuit under a cover up by a pool. Your coworkers took it upon themselves to comment on your body and clothing. If you\u2019re in the US, this could be considered sexual harassment.

It seems hems are coming down lately, so to speak.", "NTA, this is some classic women-hating-women shit.

Me-ow.", "NTA. Damn a lot of you work in stuffy environments. I don\u2019t know anyone who would care about someone wearing a modest bikini at a resort, even for a \u201cwork trip.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a formal restaurant, it was tables by the pool. If wearing a bathing suit is somehow improper to your employers, they shouldn\u2019t have booked a resort like this.", "NTA.\n\nAt first, when you mentioned bikinis, I was thinking of those string bikini types, where it is pretty revealing, showing a lot of asscheeks, sideboobs and whatnot.\n\nUntil you mentioned the bottom was covered fully, like shorts and the top is more of a sports bra. Which I feel is fine for the occasion.\n\nIt's supposed to be a casual company event for the employees to relax over the weekends. So technically, there should be no dress code. I don't see anything wrong with what you are wearing to swim. Moreover, you covered up for lunch.", "I can't fathom the ethics of anyone who thinks it matters what you wear in this context.

NTA, this sounds like a perfectly acceptable bathing suit to wear.", "the amount of y t a is genuinely idiotic. you put on a cover up. it was a poolside restaurant. you\u2019re on a VACATION. smh y\u2019all need to mind your own god damn business about what other people choose to wear. NTA and PLEASE don\u2019t for a second think you are", "NTA", "I personally think anyone getting hung up on that sort of thing needs to unplug from society for a minute and think about what really matters.

An astronaut suit? A Chewbacca costume? The admonitions of numerous posters questioning OP\u2019s professionalism are actual dog shit. Motherfuckers see the belly button of a grown woman and it throws them into a tizzy.

Might wanna edit your post again.", "I completely agree. A lot of these comments ooze of no real life experience. Sure showing up to lunch in a bathing suit is probably mildly unprofessional but it doesn\u2019t even come close to the realm of asshole behavior. Especially at a resort and a poolside restaurant. Adults should be able to realize that there is no real world difference between putting on a coverup at the restaurant as compared to the pool that is within spitting distance. I chalk it up to the usual Reddit idiots hating on a woman.", "I commented on another of OP\u2019s comments about this more generally, and I work in HR, but you need to understand *there is **no*** appropriate business casual swimwear. \n\nDo not mix pools, booze, and work if you want to maintain professional boundaries. Whoever you work for is creating a recipe for disaster.", "She had a coverup that she didn't put on until AFTER she got there and  made a spectacle of herself.   Either she didn't think it was wrong (in which case why put on a coverup) or she knew it was wrong and wanted to make darn sure everyone saw her prancing around in her bikini before making a big production of putting the cover up on.", "I think the issue is that you focused on location context rather than situational context. For example, if you went to a nightclub with your colleagues, would you wear \u201cclubby\u201d clothes because you are at a club? Or would you pick something closer to cocktail attire because of the audience you would have with you?\n\nAnd to be clear, I\u2019m not calling you an AH because you did something shitty. It\u2019s because this was a bad miscue for the professional setting. Even in the environment you were in, you were \u201con-duty.\u201d In your place, I straight up would have avoided swimming around my colleagues and found a way to enjoy it when they wouldn\u2019t be around. But again, you didn\u2019t do something bad. Just an awkward judgement call that you can learn from.", "This is why I absolutely fucking hate most work events outside of work hours.

I'm happy you enjoyed it!", "Ugh company retreat sounds like one of my worst (social) nightmares.

At my job we aren\u2019t competing for promotions and we suffer together every day (low staffing), so some of us are pals even outside of work.

Easy NTA but I wouldn't want to open the can of worms of any of the men seeing any more of you than necessary just because it might change their perception of you from coworker to sexual being.

Insecurity is a hell of a thing!", "I'm a fashion idiot, but a poolside lunch in a bikini and cover-up seems 100% appropriate to me.  Operant words being POOL and SIDE.

The only difference is that she had on a modest 2 piece and they wore one pieces.", "If the company is paying for it and it's limited to colleagues, it's a work activity, even if it's branded as a vacation.
