The bottom was full coverage and was almost like shorts, and the top resembled a sports bra more than anything else. \n\nThe other 2 women told me that I should be old enough to know that was stupid.

I personally couldn\u2019t bring myself to wear a bathing suit on a work trip at all lol, but that doesn\u2019t mean other people have to adhere to my boundaries. It\u2019s silly in this day and age to be so uptight about it. They\u2019re all adult coworkers, it shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n\nEdit- wait you wore the swimsuit *to lunch* \u2026? Yea YTA lol.

These are your work colleagues and keeping a mostly professional vibe should always be expected even when doing \"offsite\" events.

But then your coworkers might be thinking about you wearing string bikini from now on even when you're in the office.\n\nI'm not saying what you wore is inappropriate because (gasp!) midriff!

It would be fine if you were eating in your lounge chair, but not at a sit down restaurant.", "N-T-A for wearing the suit by the pool, but YTA for \"I was not wearing the swimsuit at lunch. I walked up the the place in it and put my coverup on as we sat down.\"  So technically you had the bathing suit with a coverup thrown over it at lunch.  So you were wearing a bathing suit at lunch.

What was everyone else (including the guys) wearing? \n\nIf you were the only one in a midriff-baring swimsuit and everyone else was dressed more conservatively, you might get a few raised eyebrows.\n\nIt might also be profession-dependent, because some fields have more unspoken rules about clothing.

We all act a bit more conservatively when around coworkers and showing up to lunch in a bathing suit and coverup when everyone else is going to be fully dressed is a bad look.

What you described sounded totally ok for lounging by the pool but I would have put on a coverup before meeting them at the restaurant\u2026   Waltzing up to lunch in a bikini when no one else is even wearing a swim suit would be a little off putting.", "Yep.

Whether it is \"gauche\" to arrive in a conservative bathing suit and then put on a coverup is up for debate and everyone will have an opinion about that. \n\nBut what those two women did is, without a doubt gauche as hell.

This Winter, our org and some other high performers plus our spouses were treated by our CEO to a long weekend in Hawaii, all expenses paid.

It isn't your concern just like your swimwear isn't theirs either.", "NTA. I'm sorry that the other two women made you feel uncomfortable about your bikini. From what you described, it sounds like your swimsuit was totally appropriate and you should be able to wear what you feel comfortable in. Don't let their comments get you down - wear whatever swimsuit makes you feel most comfortable, and enjoy your time by the pool! Also, maybe it's time to speak to HR about harassment. What they said to you was totally inappropriate. I would feel horrendous going back into a workplace where I was spoken to like that by colleagues.", "NTA but depending on the workplace, maybe not the best choice as far as matching work culture. I\u2019ve had friends work at small family businesses and the company cookout is a big party and it would blend to wear a bikini. Personally I work in male centric environments that prefer business or business casual and no one would wear a swimsuit of any sort to a work lunch, cover up or not.", "NTA, they can cry about it if they don't like it.", "I'm pretty fast to call out attention-seeking bullshit, but this ain't it, NTA.\n\nFirst of all, it's not a work event, it was a compensation package. Second, what you're describing is the exact outfit that I think is a bit much in the gym (like, Planet Fitness, not a resort gym), but I see it all the time so it's not like it's wildly sexual. You were at the pool by yourself and then met them at the poolside restaurant where you covered yourself up. \n\nHowever, I have also worked in small agency environments before, and I do think there is a chance that there is more to the story here.

Which honestly depends on what your coworkers were wearing. If the women were in one-pieces and/or the men were in swim trunks, I think your swimsuit + cover-up is fine for lunch.

Rolling up to a table and then taking out your cover up and putting it on at the table before you sit down is just...weird. Even if you had on a neck to ankle bodysuit!\n\nYour coworkers are right in that the manner in which you called attention to yourself might have consequences for you because it is just kind if weird to stroll up to the table in your bikini, whip out your wrap, and put it on as people are greeting you as you sit down. I accept this may not have been attention seeking behavior on your part but it certainly may read like that to the room.  I suspect that one of the guys who walked into the restaurant in his speedo and waited until he was at the table to get out his pants and shirt to put them on would get the exact same sort of wtf reaction.\n\nBut whatever, in the grand scheme of things I think you could have done a lot worse.  Once at a company party I saw an employee doing body shots with the assistant manager's husband when they were both drunk as skunks.

You might be at the pool or a golf course or a restaurant, but if you act/speak/dress/etc. in a way you wouldn't normally in the office, people are still going to remember it when they're in the office. It's a matter of where the line is. For example, wearing shorts and having a beer at the company picnic would be considered okay because, while it's not something you'd do in the office, it's innocent enough and the setting allows for it. Wearing a thong bikini and throwing back six margaritas at the company picnic, while also not illegal or wrong, is going to reflect badly once you're back at work.
