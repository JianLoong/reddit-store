I (22F) am staying at my mom's house while I'm doing an internship in my home city. She left this weekend, and I'm staying here by myself. For some context, my mom just moved into a new house in kind of a *nobody minds their business* neighborhood. \n\nSo I'm out in the garage building stuff for my mom, listening to music, using power tools. When I'm about 30 minutes in, this man that looked to be about my dads age comes up to me and asks me if I have any idea what I'm doing. I said yes, and asked him who he was. He pointed to his house and then asks \"and who are you?\". I tell him I'm the daughter of the owner of this house. He says \"that's funny, *name of old homeowner* doesn't have a daughter.\" So I said well I'm not ____'s daughter, she doesn't own this house anymore.  He starts getting argumentative, so I decide to just ignore him and keep working. He stands there trying to shout over the tools, but leaves eventually. I finish up for the day and have a beer before going inside. \n\nWell yesterday morning, my mom calls me and tells me that there's a post about me on the neighborhood's Facebook page that says I was rude, and that my mom was letting some \"disrespectful teenager\" play around with power tools unattended, and that \"underage drinking\" was taking place and included \"photographic evidence\". There were a few comments under the post criticizing him for taking pictures of me, but there were also a whole bunch saying crap like \"kids these days\" etc. Here's what apparently makes me an AH. So, I commented on the post saying \"actually sir, I am 22 years old, I work in a shop when I'm up at college, and I was not doing anything wrong. Please delete these photos of me.\" He messaged me on Facebook messenger calling me an entitled AH and accused me of lying to him, asked to see my ID, threatened to call the cops, then promptly blocked me. My mom is angry at me because I \"embarrassed\" her in her new neighborhood and said I should have ignored the post because now we both look like AH's, and I was pissed because I didn't think I did anything wrong. Oh and apparently, this dude's wife is on the HOA board, so my mom is afraid of retaliation. If I was a 45 year old man doing the exact same thing, nobody would bat an eye. I really don't think I was the AH here, but my mom sure seems to think so, and she will only respond in really cryptic ways to my texts I send her.", "created_utc": 1684771364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ouzsf/aita_for_responding_to_a_neighbor_on_facebook/", "score": 260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom's preferred strategy of wanting to ignore or smooth things over is not suited to the kind of bullying and creepiness of this new neighbor. Your response was appropriate, and if your mom is worried about the HOA, do get an attorney sooner than later.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is easy: Tell your mom if she does not like the way you housesit, she can find someone else to do it.", "NTA.  This is frightening.  He just bulled his way right on into your mom's house and started bossing you around.  My first thought was that, if he'd have not backed down and gone away, for you to have called the police.\n\nYou may want to report him to the mods on the neighborhood FB page.  I'm not sure just how legal it is to be taking pictures of someone without their permission and posting them all over social media.  So I might even consider making a police report.

Your mom is being ridiculous.  Most HOA's need to be fought against with every fiber of our being.  So, the fact that she's all cowed by what \"might\" happen is concerning.  \n\nDoes this bully's wife even know what he did?

She got a promotion at work and moved into this neighborhood and wants to uphold this image of being a well-off and successful person.

She apologized for getting angry at me, and she has since sent a message to talk to this man's wife on Facebook messenger. She didn't respond, but the The Facebook post has been deleted and we're both writing a formal letter and an email to the neighborhood HOA about his behavior. \n\nAlso, I went ahead and read through the HOA agreement for our neighborhood to make sure all of my bases were covered. We have \"quiet\" times on weekdays, weekends are way more lax. Also, there is no mention of being prohibited from using tools/mowing the lawn/other noisemakers as long as you are within the allocated hours. I was well within the time limit, so no issue there. Second, the Facebook group has rules listed that states you cannot post an image of another person without their consent, so I'm guessing this is why the post was taken down after I reported it to the group moderators. I have also printed out a retaliation clause as it relates to HOA in accordance to the law of the state I reside in, so I have that handy. \n\nAnother thing that happened, my next-door neighbor came and knocked on the door about an hour ago and told me that most of the people on our street have an issue with that man. He is apparently over 60, retired, and has nothing better to do than bother people. He goes for walks around the neighborhood and writes down any HOA violations on a notepad and gives them to his wife, and she then enforces the code violations. So basically he's just a jerk who enjoys getting people in trouble. I decided that if there is a next time I will call the cops, I also ordered outdoor cameras for my mom, and one of my projects this morning was installing a ring doorbell which she meant to install anyways.
