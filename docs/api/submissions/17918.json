I (22F) am staying at my mom's house while I'm doing an internship in my home city. She left this weekend, and I'm staying here by myself. For some context, my mom just moved into a new house in kind of a *nobody minds their business* neighborhood. \n\nSo I'm out in the garage building stuff for my mom, listening to music, using power tools. When I'm about 30 minutes in, this man that looked to be about my dads age comes up to me and asks me if I have any idea what I'm doing. I said yes, and asked him who he was. He pointed to his house and then asks \"and who are you?\". I tell him I'm the daughter of the owner of this house. He says \"that's funny, *name of old homeowner* doesn't have a daughter.\" So I said well I'm not ____'s daughter, she doesn't own this house anymore.  He starts getting argumentative, so I decide to just ignore him and keep working. He stands there trying to shout over the tools, but leaves eventually. I finish up for the day and have a beer before going inside. \n\nWell yesterday morning, my mom calls me and tells me that there's a post about me on the neighborhood's Facebook page that says I was rude, and that my mom was letting some \"disrespectful teenager\" play around with power tools unattended, and that \"underage drinking\" was taking place and included \"photographic evidence\". There were a few comments under the post criticizing him for taking pictures of me, but there were also a whole bunch saying crap like \"kids these days\" etc. Here's what apparently makes me an AH. So, I commented on the post saying \"actually sir, I am 22 years old, I work in a shop when I'm up at college, and I was not doing anything wrong. Please delete these photos of me.\" He messaged me on Facebook messenger calling me an entitled AH and accused me of lying to him, asked to see my ID, threatened to call the cops, then promptly blocked me. My mom is angry at me because I \"embarrassed\" her in her new neighborhood and said I should have ignored the post because now we both look like AH's, and I was pissed because I didn't think I did anything wrong. Oh and apparently, this dude's wife is on the HOA board, so my mom is afraid of retaliation. If I was a 45 year old man doing the exact same thing, nobody would bat an eye. I really don't think I was the AH here, but my mom sure seems to think so, and she will only respond in really cryptic ways to my texts I send her.", "created_utc": 1684771364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ouzsf/aita_for_responding_to_a_neighbor_on_facebook/", "score": 726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure just how legal it is to be taking pictures of someone without their permission and posting them all over social media.  So I might even consider making a police report.

She apologized for getting angry at me, and she has since sent a message to talk to this man's wife on Facebook messenger. She didn't respond, but the The Facebook post has been deleted and we're both writing a formal letter and an email to the neighborhood HOA about his behavior. \n\nAlso, I went ahead and read through the HOA agreement for our neighborhood to make sure all of my bases were covered. We have \"quiet\" times on weekdays, weekends are way more lax. Also, there is no mention of being prohibited from using tools/mowing the lawn/other noisemakers as long as you are within the allocated hours. I was well within the time limit, so no issue there. Second, the Facebook group has rules listed that states you cannot post an image of another person without their consent, so I'm guessing this is why the post was taken down after I reported it to the group moderators. I have also printed out a retaliation clause as it relates to HOA in accordance to the law of the state I reside in, so I have that handy. \n\nAnother thing that happened, my next-door neighbor came and knocked on the door about an hour ago and told me that most of the people on our street have an issue with that man. He is apparently over 60, retired, and has nothing better to do than bother people. He goes for walks around the neighborhood and writes down any HOA violations on a notepad and gives them to his wife, and she then enforces the code violations. So basically he's just a jerk who enjoys getting people in trouble.

What's also funny is he's an older gentleman who looks like he walked straight out of The Godfather (including the accent) and basically told me don't worry about it.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I\u2019m just picturing it.", "NTA\n\nA 45 yo man got aggressive with a 22 yo woman. The problem is the aggressive and threatening man not minding his own business.\n\nSpeak to an officer at the police station and express concerns of retaliation so it's on someone's radar already.", "NTA. If you were a 22 year old man or a 17 year old male nobody would still blink an eye because of being male. If you were around his age female he would have condescendingly asked if you needed help because he obviously is chauvinistic. I\u2019m 45 and I would have just been nosey and asked what you were making. But the neighbor was an asshole for many things. First for implying you couldn\u2019t possibly know what you\u2019re doing, then posting about you and what he decided what your age is. Then he was an asshole again with his message to you.  He\u2019s young enough to have had girls in his shop class in school and knows we can certainly do all of that stuff too. He\u2019s just a chauvinistic asshole.", "Sounds like it\u2019s time to stop helping mom out by building her things since it only gets you harassed and embarrasses her. NTA", "NTA.  But your mom's neighbor is.", "NTA", "Contact FB and have the post taken down. There's no worries about reporting pictures illegally posted - you did not give permission for your picture to be posted. FB isn't going to out you. I don't do personal pictures on social media, no one needs to know about me ;)", "NTA, and stop helping your mother with housework.", "NTA. Nosey man not minding his own business starting unnecessary drama by lying. Then he gets upset when you call him out with the truth. NTA at all.  I\u2019m sad that ur mom is calling you the AH:", "NTA.   I would have called the cops on him when he was on your mom\u2019s property.  Never let someone threaten you in your own space.  He was not acting out of concern, he was being aggressive and trying to intimidate a woman.  He really needs to be put in his place by an officer.", "NTA - My next post would be a screen shot of the DM asking him once again to not be creepy and make you and your mom feel unsafe.\n\nDouble down on showing the neighborhood he's out of line.", "I would almost bet money that if you call the cops, they will know this guy by name because he calls so often.", "A guy like this held me at gunpoint in my own neighborhood when I (39F) was going to help an elderly neighbor *who had called me for help*. Guess my tattoos made me look \u201clike a looter\u201d. Glad to see you are taking this guy seriously, men like this can be dangerous.", "While she\u2019s in her own garage and he wandered onto the property\u2026", "NTA! He is the AH, he embarrassed himself, and your mom should take your side!", "Your NTA but the guy and your Mom both arr", "NTA", "What a creepy fuck. NTA \nCall the cops and report him for trespassing and intimidating behavior. Tell them you\u2019re watching your mothers property and you\u2019re concerned about your safety.  Honestly", "NTA I can understand your mom\u2018s worry, but you handled that well, laid out the facts, and simply asked him to remove the photos of you. It was super gross and creepy that he did that to begin with! And he\u2019s lashing out in anger because he knows he was wrong but will never admit it.", "Just threaten him with some kind of legal action if he comes to you again with his bullshit.", "If he's true to form, they probably snuck out late at night.", "NTA. Sounds like your neighbors should get together and vote out Mrs. Joe Nosey from the HOA and install new officers.", "NTA. And I would write an email to the entire HOA board telling them that man was photographing you and posting it on social media without your permission...which is harassment. Tell them you have concerns for your safety, especially after he made spurious accusations about you breaking the law. And he accused you of not being qualified to handle power tools...which you use regularly at work, so he was discriminating against you because of your gender. It makes you wonder just what kind of new neighbors your mom has.", "OP screen shot that post and keep it as evidence for harassment. He has no right to ask for you for your ID or for you to tell him anything; especially your age. I mean so he thought you were a teenager this whole time and came to harass you unsupervised? That says a lot. The fact he came on your moms property is ridiculous. He must feel empowered with his wife being part of the HOA.", "I don\u2019t mean to sound like a coward, but in this age of \u201ceveryone\u2019s got a gun and looking for any excuse to use it\u201d, I\u2019d just ignore him and drop the whole thing.", "NTA and I hope your mom moves lol I know she just moved in but I'd nope out of there so fast OR become their new favourite person to hate.", "NTA - That dude has some nerve to take pictures and post them of you behind your back. If the wife makes some HOA board noise, go to the HOA meeting and ask her to have her husband stop taking pictures of you and posting them online, or you will get a restraining order so he is no longer allowed on your property.", "NTA, by the way.", "That's fucked. Also makes me assume you're American (forgive me if im wrong). That's so scary.  Like..explain yourself now or get shot.", "Like some rando (especially \"teenager\") is gonna break in and open the garage door and start assembling furniture. The mental image of that makes me laugh .", "[removed]", "NTA I would actually put a post up accusing him of harassment and inappropriate behaviour", "NTA but would've been nice to give your mom a heads up before clapping back on Facebook. Even though you're in the right, you're just staying temporarily while she has to live there and deal with any fallout. Glad to see it seems to be working out though.", "NTA\n\nReport him to Facebook. Contact their human resources. They'll lock his account lmao. \n\nYour mom is in the wrong here. He's a typical HOA narcissist who's trying to abuse their imaginary powers", "NTA\n\nHOA stories are often power fantasies of board members sometime legitimate sometimes not.\n\nSo retaliation might be a thing. \n\nWith 22 you might look young enough that \"underage drinking\" was an honest concern.", "Nta, if it was me I\u2019d make a post with about an old man hitting on me and harassing me after trying to help your sweet mom move in. Make him the one that is embarrassed and the ah in a fake situation, which is what he is portraying of you. But I\u2019m also crazy so idk", "NTA, but I understand your and your mother's point. You are creeped out because for obvious reasons and deserve to call out someone that took photos of you without consent in an attempt to shame you, but also your mother is the one that has to see these people and live there and it's understandable if she is scared of retaliation because she is new to the neighborhood.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
