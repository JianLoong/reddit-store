It belongs in the past.\n\nYou're welcome to show that patience for outdated and wrong ideas about women's bodies if you want to, sure, I don't hold that decision against you, but you're *certainly* never obligated to.", "There\u2019s nothing tricky here. I\u2019ve seen bikinis & formal dresses on people that show far more than a breastfeeding baby. No one says anything to those folks, they get celebrated & fawned over, why pick on a mom? The insanity behind this is strange. Men show their breasts all the time, do we need to remind them not to flash the masses, or are their boobs somehow different? They\u2019re still breasts. If bare-chested men were anywhere visible, I\u2019d be the first one to point out the hypocrisy, sorry.", "glad to see someone agree with my point of view, neither party are in the wrong here", "To that I say, that\u2019s too damn bad.", "Wrong. Kid's gotta eat when kid's gotta eat.", "Lol\nWhy the fuck would she care what you prefer? This is some hardcore main character syndrome coming from you mate. You should consider working on that.", "How about next time you\u2019re out eating at a public place YOU cover your head with a towel? You\u2019d do everyone around you a favour.", "Why must she coverup? Close your eyes or something.", "I\u2019d prefer when you\u2019re out & about that you eat your food in a bathroom stall. The idea of watching you eat lunch in public is embarrassing & you should cover yourself up for it. Don\u2019t you dare go to a park & eat anything out in the sunlight or around others without a blanket over your head. Sound unpleasant? Imagine if you had no choice or control over your environment when you had to eat & people were dropping blankets on you or forcing you to eat where you sh1t? Not really fair to you as an adult, right? Same applies to baby. You\u2019re hungry, you go get your food & you eat it wherever you want, babies deserve the same. Breasts are only embarrassing if you think they are, imagine if everyone thought arms were embarrassing. Best cover those up! So, keep that in mind any time you criticize anyone for how they eat or acquire food, including those with zero choice in the matter. OP is NTA for feeding a hungry child where they became hungry.", "that or go someone with more privacy for the 10 minutes that the child needs to feed, i don\u2019t see how that is unreasonable", "That\u2019s too damn bad. Sucks for you.", "I think you might have been looking for NTA?\n\nI don't see how she's the asshole", "Is this a typo? I think you meant she\u2019s NTA?", "Why is OP TA exactly? Or was this a typo in your judgment?", "I'm French and it's not that normal. In nudist spaces? Yes. At home, with guests you don't know? No. It's considered to be rude.", "Lol. What? It is not at all common or normal to hang out nude at home with guests or at a beach in France. You might see some women sunbathing topless at French beaches (like maybe 15%) but if you stride into a normal public beach with your cock out in France you would for sure be a freak and likely have the police called on you. Your teacher was likely pulling your leg.", "Nope, not normal at all.\nI'm French and the only people who are nude at home or at the beach are nudist/naturists, and even then they would know better than to stay naked when they receive guests becaus ethey know that they are the exception, not the rule.\n\nFrance may be less prude than the USA, but not THAT much. Women breastfeeding in public still get occasionally berated by overly prude people. Some of them even mde the news when it happened in some famous public places like The Louvres Museum.", "Did the french teacher\u2019s family not know they were coming by or something?", "Oh I'm sure she's proud your baby has only had exclusive breast milk. She just thinks you should feed your baby in a hole underground away from all prying eyes of humans otherwise people might find out women have breasts!", "Those that judge, don't matter. Those that matter, don't judge.", "No, it isn't. What *is* inappropriate is to stare at or try to shame someone who is breastfeeding.", "There it is- the stupidest thing I've read today", "Babies can overheat easily with a cover on while breastfeeding when it\u2019s hot out. It\u2019s summer and OP was presumably outdoors since she was at a picnic. The potential harm to the child (not a huge risk, but a risk nonetheless) is more important that the potential harm to your sensibilities (literally no risk; your eyeballs won\u2019t melt if you see a nipple for 20 seconds).", "It was in public and the baby latched quickly. Nips were only exposed probably 10-20 seconds. Prudes gonna prude", "Why is breastfeeding in public inappropriate but general cleavage isn't? Please explain the difference.", "Being uncomfortable in the presence of a nursing mother and child is a *spectator* problem, not a *breastfeeding mother's* problem.", "I mean, everyone I knew who freaked out about nursing in public is a Republican \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they tend to freak out about any sort of body part showing.", "Often, breastfeeding looks a lot like cuddling. Especially once the baby is older. You might not have recognized it when you saw it.\n\nBesides, how many times have you noticed someone giving a baby a bottle? Maybe you just don\u2019t pay attention to parents? (And I don\u2019t mean that in a mean way. We\u2019re really good at ignoring things that are not relevant to us).", "I think it depends where you are, super normal in Spain, whole breast out in public, kind of nice how unremarkable it is really.", "I completely loose my shit when it comes to my baby.  Kudos for no biting you tongue", "I\u2019m not sure\u2026 (a guess?) but i think they\u2019re saying OP is the AH because she doesn\u2019t care about anyone else\u2019s comfort but her own??\n\n\ud83d\ude02 i don\u2019t know just a guess - could be wrong and could be a typo", "ah thats understandable, anyone would be uncomfortable if you were a guest and you went into the kitchen and saw your FIL thing just flying around", "Thanks for clearing that up. Because I was going to call bullshit. \n\nI think it might have been normal for her French teachers family.", "I wouldnt doubt it if she was pulling the classes\u2019  leg, one time we had a full on class discussion on whether a hotdog was a sandwich or taco", "Haha, in what universe is this normal? \ud83d\ude02\nYeah, dangling your baguette with your in laws because \"they are French\".", "I taught piano lessons to a French family and their toddlers always ran around nude while I taught the older kids. The mom apologized a few times, but no one was troubled by it. They were little though", "im not sure tbh, i knew she was from some french speaking part of Africa. Her family lived all over europe, shes here in the states with her husband. So im assuming that the her family was fully aware of it", "Don't want to see someone exposing themselves in public to breastfeed. That is inappropriate", "It doesn't cause the baby brain damage to have a thin cover on whilst breastfeeding. I  was born in the 90s and I know that my Muslim mother wouldn't have breast fed me in public with her nipple exposed.", "No its not about being a prude. If a guy flashed briefly for 10-20 seconds he would be done for indecency so keep your nipples exposure to yourself.", "You're probably right haha. Still not sure how to feel  if like a friend of mine got a kid and started breastfeeding mid conversation", "So i was curious and appearently there are some different opinions here in the Netherlands. Saw a story where a woman almost got kicked out of a store for breastfeeding. But it is also legally always allowed. And appearently 30% of women would not want to breastfeed in public cuz of shame and stuff. I think Spain is much more ljberal in this", "Taco.", "I wonder if that nude meeting was back in the 70\u2019s or something.", "Why are you sexualizing a baby eating,?", "Then don't look.  Babies gotta eat.  That's more important than your silly pearl clutching.", "then shut your eyes or look away. you always have that option. a baby does not have the option to not eat.", "She didn't do anything sexual or offensive. It's on you that you are sexualizing the act of breastfeeding.", "You were born in the 90s of which century exactly? Your mum deserves better.", "Nipples aren\u2019t genitals. Do you tell men at the pool to put on shirts to hide their shame?", "How is the fuck is a nipple that is feeding a child the same as flashing your whole dick", "> If a guy flashed briefly for 10-20 seconds he would be done for indecency so keep your nipples exposure to yourself.\n\nMen expose their nipples in public all the time, and are not considered indecent.  I\u2019m assuming you are saying if a guy exposed his genitalia, it would be indecent.  And it would.  However, OP was not exposing her genitalia.", "You're a special kind of stupid, aren't you?", "Showing a dick is different than a baby feeding from a breast that you can't even see, to compare such things is creepy.", "There is nothing sexual about feeding a baby. Grow up.", "If you mean with his penis then yes because that\u2019s his genitals. Men walk around shirtless in public with no issue, women should be able too, especially in this case there\u2019s an actual purpose", "Yeah, people are frequently topless on beaches here too. I suspect climate has a lot to do with it, in warmer areas (southern spain here) people are more used to.less clothing. Makes sense. Having lived the the US too though, they do sometimes get super weird about bodies....", "Sandwich.", "How is asking a woman to not expose her nipple in public sexualizing a baby . Stop making shit up and go away.", "Thankfully in England we don't have trampy people breastfeeding in public", "I am not sexualising. Private parts should be covered in public.", "You can see it just you're making uo excuses.", "Having nipples exposed in public is inappropriate. Exposing in public like that and acting like its natural  even in piss poor hot countries like Africa and India the women don't expose their nipples. You are shameless and have zero culture if you see nothing wrong with showing abit of nipple in public", "Sando", "Definitely a sandwich. Tacos are on tortillas.", "Because the \"nipple\" feeds the baby you moron, get over yourself", "That's not true considering England has laws to protect moms who breastfeed in public.
