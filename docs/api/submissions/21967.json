And the downside of all of that is that just doing a natural thing like feeding your baby is offensive to someone, because in other situations your boobs could be sexualised... and most likely when the aunt was younger and had a baby herself, it would've been extremely taboo because of this.\n\nIt's very hard to change the views that are basically brainwashed into you by society around things like this, which will be different depending on which generation you grew up in. \n\nIt's just utter nonsense really.
