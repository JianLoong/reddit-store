My daughter (21F) and my son (24M). My son has been going the a tough time. He and his girlfriend recently broke up, but they have a one year old son together. My son gets his baby on the weekends, but because of his work schedule he needs someone to help watch the baby in the evenings. My son has been staying with my wife (his stepmom) and l since he and his ex broke up, so my wife usually watches the baby during the evenings on the weekend. However, this weekend she is going out of town, so my son has to find someone to babysit the baby. I would watch my grandson, but I have to work too. \n\nI suggested that my son asks his sister to watch the baby. My daughter hasn\u2019t had much to do with me or my son since I married my wife a few years ago. My daughter and my wife don\u2019t particularly get along, but my wife won\u2019t be in town so I don\u2019t see a problem. My son called his sister, and asked if she was working this weekend. My daughter said no, and she was just planning on spending time with her girlfriend and cleaning her house this weekend. My son then asks if it\u2019s possible if she can watch the baby for a few hours this weekend. My daughter came up with an excuse to why she couldn\u2019t do it. My son told her that he was willing to pay her to watch the baby, but she still said that she couldn\u2019t. He explained his situation, but my daughter seems to have no empathy. After they ended their call, I called my daughter. \n\nI asked my daughter why she can\u2019t help out this one time. My daughter still insisted that it\u2019s impossible for her to watch the baby for a few hours, so I told her that she\u2019s being selfish by not helping her brother knowing his situation. My daughter has a habit of crying to get out of things, so that\u2019s what she did. My daughter cried and told me that I expect her to drop everything for her brother all the time. I tried to tell her that this wasn\u2019t about her brother, this is about her nephew. No matter how she feels about her brother her nephew is innocent. My daughter then hung up abruptly. I don\u2019t like to leave things unresolved, so I called her back a few times. Her girlfriend then inserted herself in our conversation, and told me to stop calling my daughter or she would block me. I then got a call from my ex-wife calling me an asshole, and telling me that I need to apologize to my daughter. \n\nI don\u2019t think I was being unfair to my daughter. My son is having a hard time, and needs some extra help.

She does not owe anyone an explanation beyond that.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter has her own plans. Your son can hire a babysitter.\n\n>No matter how she feels about her brother her nephew is innocent.\n\nYeah the baby is innocent, but the baby also is NOT her responsibility.", "YTA. The fact that you couldn\u2019t accept your daughter saying no to helping your son definitely makes me think that you do favor your son and just expect your daughter to drop everything to help him and that is extremely unfair of you. It doesn\u2019t matter why your daughter said she couldn\u2019t do it she told both your son and you no multiple times so let it go and apologize to your daughter for how your treating her.", "If he can pay your daughter, why don't pay a babysitter ti solve the problem everytime?", "YTA \u201cdaughter hasn\u2019t had much to do with me or my son\u201d and you expect a favor from her? This reaction is likely why she doesn\u2019t have much to do with y\u2019all. Harassing her about it was fkn disgusting. She told you no. That\u2019s all she\u2019s required to tell you. Why she can\u2019t isn\u2019t of any value - she can\u2019t. What\u2019s with men of your age not understanding \u201cno\u201d.", "YTA. Leave her alone.

What did you expect?\n\nYTA. YTA. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter is under no obligation to solve your son's problems. Have you always treated her like she's your son's sidekick? Because a pattern of that could explain her reaction here.\n\nYour son can do what many parents have to do: figure it out. Switch shifts. Find another family member. Trade a weekday for a weekend day with the kid's mom. Hire a babysitter. Take the day off. Why are you even involved here? Your son is an adult who can handle his own responsibilities. Your only move here, if you want to help, is to take the day off so you can babysit.\n\nYour daughter is not being selfish. She has her own life. She doesn't owe you or anyone an explanation as to why she can't watch the kid. She can't watch the kid. Deal with it like an adult.\n\n>My daughter has a habit of crying to get out of things, so that\u2019s what she did.\n\nWELL ACTUALLY girls are socialized to express anger and frustration by crying. Sometimes we can't help it. Especially in situations where we have trauma from asshole parents who have a history of treating us like crap. Perhaps she is crying because she is legitimately upset/angry/scared. Perhaps you need to think on that.", "YTA - \n\nWeekend jobs aren't the only jobs has you suggested to your son that he find a job where he can watch his own kid?   he only gets the kid on the weekends but has to work so he can't spend time.   \n\nYou were really messed up to tell your daughter that what she had planned for the weekend was as important, nor should you have called your daughter selfish, because she wasn't being selfish. \n\nAnd your daughter wasn't crying to \"get out of anything\" she was crying because her dad was abusing her. \n\nThe girlfriend HAD to insert her self to protect your daughter FROM YOU berating her.   \n\nHe asked she said no, he calls off work.  That's it.  \n\nI swear, are you making this up?", "YTA, and you pushing and pushing says that you have never respected her boundaries which resulted in her low contact with you and brother.  I'm betting you always put brother over her too.  Don't be shocked if she completely cuts contact.  \n\nWould it be nice for her to watch the baby?  Sure, but she said no.  Y'all need to sort something else out. His kid isn't her problem at the end of the day.  Why can't your son's ex or mom take the baby?", "Yta. It's clear that your daughter is low contact with both you and your son, yet you have chosen to ignore this in order to impose your son and his kid on her. She doesn't want to look after your grandkid, she doesn't actually need any reason. It sucks for your son, but it's her right.\n\n\nIt sodns liek there's a history of you expecting to help out your son. How often have you or your son helped her?\n\nYour daughter is low contact with you as much as your wife, respect that and leave her alone. Bombarding her phone just because your son hasn't got his way isn't going to encourage a positive relationship, but will only harm it further.", "YTA, one no is a complete sentence, but you decided to go the harassment route to try and get what you want, also not your daughter's kid, not her problem it's your son's problem and his problem to find the solution, he can't handle being a parent, well maybe he should have kept it in his pants.", "YTA. She said no, she\u2019s a grown ass adult she doesn\u2019t owe you an explanation, and your son doesn\u2019t need to feel entitled to other people caring for his child just because they\u2019re family. Nobody owes your son anything for having a child. That was his decision, respect your daughters boundaries.", "YTA. I can't help but notice that you never tell us what excuse your daughter gave. Just that she came up with one. All we get to know is that it's an \"excuse\" and therefore invalid. \n\nWell, since we don't get the full picture what we do know is that your son asked several times, you asked several times, and that neither of you would take 'no' for an answer, which is classic 'asshole' behavior. In fact, you were so insistent that other people felt compelled to intervene on your daughter's behalf. \n\nIf she's not allowed to say 'no' then you're not asking, are you? You're demanding. And that doesn't make her selfish, it makes you the asshole.", "YTA. \"No\" is a complete sentence. \nThe fact that you continued to push when she said no repeatedly makes YTA. To be honest, that's probably why she cries. It's so damn frustrating to have people continue pushing an issue when you've clearly refused, multiple times. \nYour son knows when he has his son. I would assume he also knew when your wife was going to be out of town. He, the child's father, should have dealt with this scheduling conflict days ago. You have no right to demand that your daughter drop everything and watch a child that isn't hers at the last minute. You also have no right to declare her plans unimportant or continue to badger her about it.", "YTA.\n\nShe has no obligation to help him. You have no reason to insist that she does. You (and your son) are the problem here. \n\nSince he's \"willing to pay\", he should be willing to pay market rate for a proper babysitter. Find a proper babysitter who actually wants to be there. Not one that \"has to be.\"\n\nIf your son is having a hard time, maybe he needs to reassess his weekends with his son or adjust the schedule so he can be there with his son on his custodial days instead of having his son hang out with random people though.", "YTA. Do you even like your daughter?", "YTA. No is a complete sentence. You don\u2019t have to babysit for anyone at any time. Especially who you only deem family when it\u2019s convenient for you.", "YTA. Sounds like you have a history of treating your daughter as a second-class citizen. Tell your son he's a father now, and it is HIS responsibility to figure out accommodations for his child. It's not his sister's responsibility, and it certainly doesn't make her selfish to not be able to drop everything to babysit your sons kid. Try looking at yourself and how you've treated your daughter and take your own advice and develop some empathy.", "YTA. He asked, she said no. End of discussion.", "YTA-Stop harassing your daughter. She\u2019s not the one acting like a selfish asshole here.", "YTA, stop volunteering other people\u2019s time. Even if her plans are to lie on her sofa and make bubble noises, she said No. she said No to her brother and then you called and harassed her, driving her to tears (again from the sound of it). Then when she hung up to get herself together you REPEATEDLY called texted and harassed her until her partner stepped in to stop you. \n\nI take it your son is your golden child and your daughter was your bonus? Leave her alone. You are heading in the direction of her going No Contact - since she is already obviously Low Contact with all of you.\n\nYTA as it bears repeating. Leave the poor woman alone and stop trying to force her into situations she is unhappy in.", "YTA\n\nShe is not a mother. Your daughter has no obligation to anyone. She is crying, because you do not respect her saying no. She\u2019s an adult. You better back off, or she\u2019ll go no contact.", "YTA \u2026 and I think there\u2019s a lot of backstory here you\u2019ve left out.", ">My daughter came up with an excuse to why she couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nNo she didn't.  She has plans.  Doesn't matter if you think they're \"valid\" plans or not.  YTA.\n\nNot to mention you're borderline estranged from your daughter and sticking your nose in.  To be honest, considering the staggering cluelessness of your post, I'm not surprised.  You're being completely unreasonable, does that explain the estrangement?  Is it a pattern?\n\nKudos to your daughter's girlfriend for standing up to a bully ie: you.\n\nI'm the same age as you, I shouldn't have to explain to a 43 year old man all the fuck ups in what you've done here.", "YTA - Your son needs to grow up and learn to be a parent and figure out childcare. It is absolutely sexist and ridiculous that you would even think of imposing his drama on your daughter. Would you ask your son to help her if the roles were reversed? Probably not. YTA.", "YTA. There is far more to this story than you are letting on.  On the face of it, no, your daughter doesn\u2019t owe her brother or you any favors. A favor, like babysitting,  is something you choose to do or not do, and you got her answer.  Then you called her to push, coerce , and insult your daughter into doing what you wanted her to do.  That makes you the AH.  However, in a family when someone asks for a favor, and a few hours isn\u2019t a lot if she didn\u2019t have plans, they usually try to help.  So why isn\u2019t your daughter willing to do that? I suspect the answer has more to do with how you blended the families, treated your daughter relative to your son, or your opinion on her sexual orientation than it does with any weekend plans she may have.", "YTA, on many levels. First its not her kid, she has zero responsibilities for her nephew. Its not her job to help her older brother get his life together. To often we look at women and just assume that they are caregivers, this idea of \"you don't have kids so you have free time to watch my kids\" is getting old. Second she doesn't owe anyone an explanation, she said no, end of conversation. Third, you tried to guilt trip her into doing something she didn't want to do. Maybe she had a hard week at work, maybe her and her gf just wanted to chill and veg at home all weekend, maybe they have plans and thats why they are cleaning and just didn't want to tell you, maybe sat is their cleaning day and it would mess their whole schedule up, regardless of the reason they said no so move on. Fourth when she told you how she felt about you constantly putting your sons family over hers you told her that her feelings are invalid and don't matter while calling her a crybaby. Shit if I was their mom I would be livid as hell also. My mom does this crap all the time to my own child and I've had many an angry call about consent with her, my kid said no that means no, it doesn't mean hound her and make her feel like shit for not wanting to do x. She's a human and she's allowed to be \"selfish\". If you keep this up your daughter may do the exact same thing I did and move 20 hours away from you.", "YTA. Just because your daughter is family, doesn't mean she is obligated to change her plans to help your son.\n\nYour son needs to find a better plan as it seems that he always needs to have someone watch his kid during the time he has him. I get that he's having a hard time, but he's a parent and needs to make plans for his time with his child\n\nYou say that you called your daughter back a few times as you don't like to leave things unresolved, but there was nothing unresolved. It was resolved the minute she said no. You were being unfair to your daughter the minute you called her to harass her after she had already told you son now.", "INFO:\n\n>My daughter hasn\u2019t had much to do with me or my son since I married my wife a few years ago.

Or you can. Your daughter has no obligation to either of you, or your irresponsible son\u2019s spawn.", "YTAAAAA.  not only did you not need to step in (your son asked, she said no, that's where it should have ended), you called her names.  not only are you an adult, you're her parent.  completely and totally uncalled for.  you've probably successfully driven an even bigger wedge between the two of you.  \n\nthe rest of the story is completely irrelevant to this situation.  for all we know, she cries because she's fucking frustrated at the way she's been treated.  that's what it sounds like.  and then you called her back a few times?  that is stalker behavior.", "YTA. No is a complete sentence.", "Child care is difficult and being family doesn\u2019t make her brothers child her responsibility. \n\nBut it\u2019s not your problem and not your job to fix it.

My daughter and my wife don\u2019t particularly get along, but my wife won\u2019t be in town so I don\u2019t see a problem. My son called his sister, and asked if she was working this weekend. My daughter said no, and she was just planning on spending time with her girlfriend and cleaning her house this weekend. My son then asks if it\u2019s possible if she can watch the baby for a few hours this weekend. My daughter came up with an excuse to why she couldn\u2019t do it. My son told her that he was willing to pay her to watch the baby, but she still said that she couldn\u2019t. He explained his situation, but my daughter seems to have no empathy. After they ended their call, I called my daughter. \n\nI asked my daughter why she can\u2019t help out this one time. My daughter still insisted that it\u2019s impossible for her to watch the baby for a few hours, so I told her that she\u2019s being selfish by not helping her brother knowing his situation. My daughter has a habit of crying to get out of things, so that\u2019s what she did. My daughter cried and told me that I expect her to drop everything for her brother all the time.
