I also love the fact that your mom didn't bust you, but joined in. Your mom is awesome\n\nEdited to fix a typo", "NTA. Who\u2019s the baby now ?? Lol", "Beautiful! My christmas spirit has been restored! Good for you, OP. NTA", "Eh I think it's harmless. If it was something more tedious like lights that go on your house, I probably wouldn't have let him restring it the second time, but with this it's harmless enough.", "I thought she was going to rat me out.

He has this coming.", "NTA, I love that your mom is in on this, and if you want a big reveal, maybe The Twelve Pains of Christmas? Part of the song is someone very frustrated with lights and who kicks up a fuss with directions you can follow with the app \"one light goes out, they all go out! ... \"and why the hell are they blinking??\"", "NTA, OP. Looks like dad is reaping what he's sown there. Hilarious!", "NTA - hehehe - well played OP!", "This is brilliant! Nothing better than dad getting a wee taste of his own!\ngo mum for wanting in on the prank", "Awesome story you will have to retell each Christmas.  Lmao.", "NTA your dad could always look up the issue and see the issue. But he won't. It's on him, and for the pranks.", "NTA\n\nThat's pretty damn funny", "NTA - It's just a joke. Your mom is in on it, and she thinks it's funny too. I'd explain it on xmas eve or something to put an end-date on it, and video his reaction. ETA: If Dad is a prankster, he should be able to handle it.", "NTA, considering he also pranks other people. Just make sure you stop him before he does what I did with my parents tree lights, which was cut out the broken candle. (One candle had a broken bulb which was fine as long as the broken bulb was still in there and letting electricity flow through it, but then we took it out and none of the lights worked anymore. So I cut the bulbless candle out and then all of the other lights worked.)", "NTA - That's an actual funny joke that your mom approves of and your dad earned. I like your mom! I don't know what kind of nonsense your dad was pulling when you were a kid, but calling a child thin-skinned for not appreciating a \"prank\" pulled on them usually means the prank was just something cruel that the kid reacted to as such.", "NTA\n\nGOAT move, keep it going!", "Love it. NTA I would do the exact same thing.", "NTA\n\nI love your mom!", "NTA\n\nNormally I would say that since he's taken the lights down three times then enough is enough, but both your mother and your husband think you should keep going and that says a lot.\n\nHow long should you keep going? Think about when your dad would stop, and maybe stop a little bit sooner.\n\nBut not too much sooner, your dad is getting a taste of his own medicine.", "NTA. This is some top notch christmas shenanigans.", "NTA in addition to what others have said, the more time you keep him occupied, the less time he has to be an asshole to you.", "YTA.  This is a funny prank, but continuing to carry it on so long that your dad has to remove the lights from the tree multiple  times, it stopped being a funny prank, and become a AH move.", "Nta. This has genuinely made laugh out loud. Keep up the good work. \nI'm off to Google where I can find something similar for myself", "NTA...well played. Would love a follow-up on his reaction when joke is revealed.", "ESH clearly you're both as bad as each other."]}
