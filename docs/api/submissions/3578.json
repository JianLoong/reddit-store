I said that they hadn't notified me there was gonna be any maintenance, and even if they had, I had to get ready for work so I can't be worrying about letting the maintenance guy in and out of my room.\n\nThey said I was being unreasonable and that I was making the maintenance guy's job unnecessarily difficult, and that I wasted his time. They told me to grow up and realise the world doesn't revolve around me.\n\nThey told me the maintenance guy will come back to my room at 9am the next day. I told them I won't be there as I have an 8am lecture. They implied I should skip the class and said that it's the least I can do for being so annoying. \n\nI told them that their ideas of reasonable maintenance times for students are stupid and that most of us are busy on weekday mornings. They called me naive.\n\nMy roommate told me that the next day, the maintenance guy was knocking on my door for like 10 minutes straight, even though I told them I wouldn't be in??\n\nI'm just wondering if I'm the asshole here because I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

Tell them a time you are available and suggest they come then", "NTA a young woman, alone should not be opening her bedroom door to a stranger at 6am! I think they were rude because they shouldn\u2019t have sent him at that time. I would talk to students union or counselling and get a complaint made.", "NTA. Go to the office and say I want 24-48 hours notice going forward, as it will benefit everyone and avoid conflict. \n\nIn my 2nd year house a maintenance guy used to come whenever he wanted, so I complained to his manager and since then we had emails giving us 48hrs notice. \n\nDon\u2019t back down and take shit from anyone, if he\u2019s there to fix something minor it shouldn\u2019t be so urgent that he bangs on your door at 6am.", "NTA. Why would they expect you to just open the door when you\u2019re not expecting anyone, at unsociable hours? *Especially* as a young woman living alone? The resident support people are supposed to notify you, and they didn\u2019t, which means they didn\u2019t do their job, and then wasted the maintenance person\u2019s time by not telling them you wouldn\u2019t be home. That\u2019s not on you, OP!", "NTA. go above the heads of the residence staff and complain to the res life provost office, or something. in no world should residence staff, that you pay a lot for, be insulting you and expecting you to skip class or let maintenance in your room at 6am. there is something wrong with the staff of your residence hall and it needs to be dealt with by higher ups.", "I think they misunderstand what \"resident support\" means. They sound super lazy.\n\nNTA. Make them do their job and schedule actual appointments based on reality.", "Nta\n\n6am is THEM being unreasonable. Of they tell you to skip class them as son as they play your tuition and expenses you will listen to them. 6am is completely unreasonable and they need go schedule things with you and not try and make you skip class for some routine maintenance they haven't advised you of aheed of time. \n\nAlso who would allow someone go be in their room of apartment after you left. Also some guy is banging on your door at 6am. For safety i would advise you to not open the door. Is they give you flack, i wife really go the dean about educating his staff", "NTA\n\nOutside of an emergency situation - burst water pipes etc then you should have been notified 24+ hours beforehand of a visit.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t have opened the doors either. \n\nWhen I was living in student living I got a 24 prior email if someone was coming. The maintenance guy wouldn\u2019t knock during that time but also just walk in if you don\u2019t answer since they have a key. That the proper way to do it", "NTA. You didn\u2019t have the time. You weren\u2019t notified.", "NTA - If anything, kudos to you for protecting yourself and having smart instincts not to open the door as a young woman living alone.", "NTA. Are these adult employees or student employees giving you a hard time? Either way, their behavior is unprofessional and inappropriate. You should consider speaking to their superiors or finding another avenue to file a complaint. First of all, even in the \u201creal world,\u201d you are entitled to notice. Neither a landlord nor a maintenance worker they hired can enter a rental property without giving the tenant appropriate notice. You\u2019re paying to live there and you have certain legal rights and protections just like anyone else. Second, even if you were given notice, 6:00AM is not a reasonable time for such an appointment, especially without prior discussion and agreement. Finally, an employee at a university should not pressure a student to skip class - period. That\u2019s absurd. You did not behave unreasonably or make anything difficult for anyone. The employees failed to properly perform their duties. They were responsible for scheduling maintenance with appropriate notice at an appropriate time. You are not there to make their lives easier or clean up their mess. They are wrong and behaving badly. Take this over their heads.", "Um... No. NTA. Your RA is. A middle aged guy came into my dorm once and bypassed the locked doors, the front desk and went into a sleeping girl's room and shut the door. She was so lucky she was only robbed because it could have been a horror story. This was across the hall from me and we had our door open. We were always told never to open doors for men if we don't have advanced notice, especially if they were in a uniform. It's a common thing for rapists and burglars to put on a uniform to fool you into thinking they're a cop, maintenance person, security system installer, etc. Idk why the RA can't, with your permission, let the guy in while you're gone to check the light bulbs. Nobody should be telling you to skip a class for something this stupid.", "NTA\n\nUnless there was an absolute emergency (like flooding or a fire), there's no reason for a maintenance person to be knocking at 6 a.m.  And he should have announced himself.  If he could hear you through the door, he could have said, \"Maintenance.  I need to address an issue in your room!\"", "NTA. They can't do jack unless they give you a reasonable amount of time to confirm or change a maintenance schedule unless there is imminent danger, but then they come with police and fire department and can knock your door down and there would be absolutely zero you could do against that.\n\nI had the same problem with my property manager, up to the point that I had to point out to them (where I live) that unscheduled or without prior notification, since people are climbing around on our terrace, this consitutes trespassing and unless they do their job properly, they will have to deal with that in the future. All of a sudden everything was anounced 1-2 weeks in advance and we received personal mail asking if these times were alright for us.\n\nLong story short, they can't just show up whenever they please. THEY are wasting the maintenance guy's time and if the maintenance firm bills them for that, it's still gonna be their fault and they can't try to get it back from you, since you clearly told them that you a) have a scheduled appointment and b) can't make time on such a short notice. Next time they suggest you \"let your lecture slide\" for their poor planning, you will happily oblige as soon as they will compensate you for the missed lecture, which -  depending on where you live - can cost several hundreds of dollars.\n\nJust make sure, that if that is the level of professionalism you can get from them, you have EVERYTHING in writing. Even if it is one-sided. If they call you or tell you in person that you have to be home tomorrow at x AM, tell them you want that in writing, so you can answer, if they don't comply, just write them a one-sided Email, where you just write something like:\n\n\"As per our earlier meeting I want to emphasise again that due to the short notice of the notification I do have a lecture which I paid for and will NOT be able to conform to the time you suggest. I am willing to offer \\[your date + time\\] as an alternative. For future reference, may I suggest to notify me at the very least one week in advance as work day mornings are barely doable for me.\"\n\nNever leave anything at just \"as we talked about\". Put it in writing, send it back to them, if they do not object, looks bad for them, and nobody can claim \"you never made that clear\" should they stoop to borderline illegal stuff.

They should have keys to be able to do this, whether or not you're there. They are legally required to access your apartment from time to time to look in on things like smoke detectors, pest control, etc. That's just part of the deal of living in a place owned and operated by someone else.\n\nAnd then to treat you in such a way that makes them sound like comic book villains (literally calling you stupid and naive?) and you sound like a mistreated, innocent victim being harassed by the maintenance crew...?\n\nSounds a little sketch.

In many places, 24 hours notice is a legal requirement that someone needs access to the property eg maintenance or inspection etc. you also have a legal right to peaceful enjoyment of your property that you rent. The only time they can gain access without notice is during an emergency eg for a burst pipe. \n\nRegular maintenance must be scheduled and you must be notified in advance (24 hours is the norm and must be in writing so the verbal notice they gave you doesn\u2019t hold any weight. Also to add that in general, student housing tend to give their maintenance workers keys to rooms so it\u2019s very odd that the worker didn\u2019t have a key. They must also make reasonable adjustments where keys aren\u2019t provided that a member of staff with access is with them or that they arrange a time where you are available to let the person in. What the university did is unreasonable and a possible breach of contract. Read your tenancy agreement and see if they have breached any terms.", "So was there an email sent?  That would of been my first question. And who starts at 6 in the morning unless it is an emergency. Now you do need to be reasonably accommodating here,  I am no way saying miss class or work. But if they need to come by at 7 you need to be able to let them in.  If the school is large there are a lot of rooms they have to go through so  do what you can to speed up the process.  And FYI, they do keep a log to say how many times they went by to check something and if they were not able to check something.

There were quite a couple ways where OP wasn't necessarily mature, the problem could have easily been solved even the OP says she didn't have time to let him in for like 2 minutes so he can quickly do his lightbulb check and leave on his own.
