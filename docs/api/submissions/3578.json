Neither a landlord nor a maintenance worker they hired can enter a rental property without giving the tenant appropriate notice. You\u2019re paying to live there and you have certain legal rights and protections just like anyone else. Second, even if you were given notice, 6:00AM is not a reasonable time for such an appointment, especially without prior discussion and agreement. Finally, an employee at a university should not pressure a student to skip class - period. That\u2019s absurd. You did not behave unreasonably or make anything difficult for anyone.

We were always told never to open doors for men if we don't have advanced notice, especially if they were in a uniform.

All of a sudden everything was anounced 1-2 weeks in advance and we received personal mail asking if these times were alright for us.\n\nLong story short, they can't just show up whenever they please. THEY are wasting the maintenance guy's time and if the maintenance firm bills them for that, it's still gonna be their fault and they can't try to get it back from you, since you clearly told them that you a) have a scheduled appointment and b) can't make time on such a short notice. Next time they suggest you \"let your lecture slide\" for their poor planning, you will happily oblige as soon as they will compensate you for the missed lecture, which -  depending on where you live - can cost several hundreds of dollars.\n\nJust make sure, that if that is the level of professionalism you can get from them, you have EVERYTHING in writing. Even if it is one-sided. If they call you or tell you in person that you have to be home tomorrow at x AM, tell them you want that in writing, so you can answer, if they don't comply, just write them a one-sided Email, where you just write something like:\n\n\"As per our earlier meeting I want to emphasise again that due to the short notice of the notification I do have a lecture which I paid for and will NOT be able to conform to the time you suggest.

I [30s; F] have lived in a major US city since graduating college, and I have *never*, nor will I ever, open the door for an \"unexpected\" maintenance man. Even now that I am married, and even if my husband is home at the time, I *always* confirm with him and/or our leasing agent that \"we are expecting someone\".

They should know better. \n\nAs an adult, any apartment I have ever rented, has had in the lease that I would receive an advanced notice about scheduled maintenance, and a call from the leasing office for emergency maintenance. That is how it works in the *real world*. And yes, there absolutely has been a time when the leasing office failed to send the notification, and the maintenance had to be rescheduled because I couldn't reach anyone to confirm it. Was that inconvenient for everyone involved? Yes. Was it a matter of safety? Also yes.  Was it \"my fault\" or  something the leasing office could shame, fine, or penalize me for?

Absent an emergency if a maintenance person tried to come round without advance notice I'd tell them to take a hike!  It's completely unreasonable to expect people to be able to let them in at the drop of a hat.  It's odd enough that someone would be coming round without a request anyway.  When I lived in dorms the only time anyone came in was to fix something I'd reported.  Other than that I'd have been alarmed if someone tried to access my room!  That the housing team at the dorm then expect you to skip lectures is just crazy, it's literally a university.  You're paying an incredible amount of money, they are the ones that should be making an effort to accommodate your class schedule, not the other way around.\n\nAs an aside, someone unexpectedly knocking on your door at 6am, ask who it is OP, my first thought is an emergency because with anyone sane that's the only reason they'd be doing that at such an early hour.", "NTA and you absolutely need to file a complaint about how you were treated. It is unacceptable for the office to treat you that way, call you names, belittle you, and expect you to rearrange your schedule for maintenance. Look into your renters rights immediately and press forward with this because that is unacceptable. I had an issue with a complex accusing me of throwing trash off the balcony because they \u201cfound something with my name in the trash\u201d and called me down to the office and did something very similar where she literally lectured me and then tried to charge me $100. Turns out it was one of my room mates (each room was rented individually, with separate lease and I had sublet the room and barely met the other girls I was living with) who was too lazy to take the trash and started just flinging it into the bushes. I ended up using the aggression from the office to get out of my lease that I had recently resigned by contacting the company that owned the apartments. I hope that office manager lost her job because at 18 it was very scary and overwhelming to have a grown woman accuse me of things I didn\u2019t do, lecture and belittle me, and then try to charge me for it. \n\nOP take some action, that is unacceptable.", "NTA, I don\u2019t know what school thinks it\u2019s okay to send maintenance at 6am for anything other than an emergency.", "NTA.

I might be paranoid, but you might need to check for hidden cameras, seeing how this kind of things happen to women all over the world.", "NTA, They are gaslighting you. They didn't notify you maintenance was coming and it would have been unsafe to let him in. Sorry they spoke to you that way.", "Omg NTA. What kind of apartment management group is this?! You have offered perfectly reasonable explanations for why you didn\u2019t answer the door initially, why you can\u2019t do 9 am the next day.

We would always put up notices on any affected flats and kitchens, common areas, front doors, postboxes, etc. And I imagine now they send out an email. My manager at the time was always very clear about checking we'd given clear notice beforehand.\n\nYou have a reasonable expectation to privacy in the room you pay for. Now, in a hall, they CAN enter your room when you're not there. But you should always know about it beforehand. When I was a student, I might have been in class, but I would know that someone would pop by during the day to change a bulb, fix the shower, etc. It would never ever be a surprise that someone had been in the room. If you had to be there, they would arrange it with you properly.\n\nThe response from the office is rude and the fact that they suggested you skip class for their convenience is shocking.\n\nI'm not sure if you're in the UK, but typically, if you are, the halls are managed by a student accommodation office somewhere on campus. You need to go there and have a chat with them about what's been happening. It's possible that someone in your hall office is not working by the established rules.\n\nMake it very clear that a stranger knocking on your door at 6am unexpectedly, and especially now that the mornings are dark, is disconcerting and feels wrong. If you weren't expecting maintenance, you certainly aren't wrong for being worried about opening the door.\n\nDon't let them make you feel unreasonable, because you are in the right here.\n\nIt's also worth checking the rules of the hall or your contract before you complain, to make sure you know exactly how things should be according to their own rules.", "I had this happen one time during my time in university, they banged at 6am, woke us all up, we opened the door and they burst in past us and ran into my roommate's room who was visiting family. We were pissed until we realised water was pouring out of the light fitting and a pipe had burst. THAT is a reasonable excuse. Scheduled maintenance should be conducted at a mutually convenient time, and definitely not at 6am in the morning.", "Also, YOU are paying THEM for living accommodations. They don't get to demand anything. They don't get to tell you you're naive. They don't get to gaslight you. YOU are the client and THEY are the staff.

Someone at my university THIS YEAR was sexually assaulted because some guy knocked on her door and then assaulted her!!", "I\u2019ve had maintenance people come into my room when I wasn\u2019t there for emergency situations but I would have been peeved if they walked in unannounced when I wasn\u2019t there/wasn\u2019t expecting them. I mean there was a situation when I was just chilling in my room and maintenance knocked and then let themselves in (I didn\u2019t hear the knock) because the bathroom above me flooded and they wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t also affected but that\u2019s about it.", "Also hopping on to say I'm a big believer in writing up your complaints against the university in an op ed to the student newspaper.
