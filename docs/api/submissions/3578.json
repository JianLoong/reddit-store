Neither a landlord nor a maintenance worker they hired can enter a rental property without giving the tenant appropriate notice. You\u2019re paying to live there and you have certain legal rights and protections just like anyone else. Second, even if you were given notice, 6:00AM is not a reasonable time for such an appointment, especially without prior discussion and agreement. Finally, an employee at a university should not pressure a student to skip class - period. That\u2019s absurd. You did not behave unreasonably or make anything difficult for anyone.

We were always told never to open doors for men if we don't have advanced notice, especially if they were in a uniform.

All of a sudden everything was anounced 1-2 weeks in advance and we received personal mail asking if these times were alright for us.\n\nLong story short, they can't just show up whenever they please. THEY are wasting the maintenance guy's time and if the maintenance firm bills them for that, it's still gonna be their fault and they can't try to get it back from you, since you clearly told them that you a) have a scheduled appointment and b) can't make time on such a short notice. Next time they suggest you \"let your lecture slide\" for their poor planning, you will happily oblige as soon as they will compensate you for the missed lecture, which -  depending on where you live - can cost several hundreds of dollars.\n\nJust make sure, that if that is the level of professionalism you can get from them, you have EVERYTHING in writing. Even if it is one-sided. If they call you or tell you in person that you have to be home tomorrow at x AM, tell them you want that in writing, so you can answer, if they don't comply, just write them a one-sided Email, where you just write something like:\n\n\"As per our earlier meeting I want to emphasise again that due to the short notice of the notification I do have a lecture which I paid for and will NOT be able to conform to the time you suggest.

I [30s; F] have lived in a major US city since graduating college, and I have *never*, nor will I ever, open the door for an \"unexpected\" maintenance man. Even now that I am married, and even if my husband is home at the time, I *always* confirm with him and/or our leasing agent that \"we are expecting someone\".

They should know better. \n\nAs an adult, any apartment I have ever rented, has had in the lease that I would receive an advanced notice about scheduled maintenance, and a call from the leasing office for emergency maintenance. That is how it works in the *real world*. And yes, there absolutely has been a time when the leasing office failed to send the notification, and the maintenance had to be rescheduled because I couldn't reach anyone to confirm it. Was that inconvenient for everyone involved? Yes. Was it a matter of safety? Also yes.  Was it \"my fault\" or  something the leasing office could shame, fine, or penalize me for?

Implying you should miss class, sending strange men to young women\u2019s doors without warning, name calling a student who was making smart decisions. THEY are the naive ones. 6am is an unacceptable time for maintenance. Your safety should come first and it doesn\u2019t sound like it does.", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, 6am is absolutely not an appropriate time for them to be sending out maintenance staff. Secondly, they need to be giving you 24hr notice. Thirdly, who the fuck do they think they are to be suggesting you skip a class you are PAYING FOR, so their maintenance guy can get in? Fourthly, why the fuck does maintenance not have keys to let themselves in if the occupant isn't home? There is so much wrong with this...", "NTA - they didn't notify you and 6am is a ridiculous hour to be doing maintenace. On the second occasion you told them you would be out. I would give them a list of times you are available and give them 48 hours in which you will keep your diary free of commitments to notify you of their choice.", "A 19 year old girl who received zero notice about maintenance\u2026 it\u2019s not safe to open your door to just anybody and without prior notice why should she just accept they are who they say they are. For Undergraduates: 26.4% of women and 6.8% of men experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence, or incapacitation. 1 in 5 college-aged women survivors receives assistance from a victim services agency. 23.1% of transgender, genderqueer, nonconforming college students have been sexually assaulted. \n\nThey can grow the eff up and start acting professionally and quit demanding you give them access without verification and that you should compromise your education for their lack of scheduling skills and foresight. If they don\u2019t like it, maybe they should talk to the press about it.", "I simply wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable/safe letting an unknown person there for an unknown reason into my room at 6am. That\u2019s how people get murdered\u2026 NTA!", "Sure but they offered to come back at 9am, but that wasn't good for the OP either. They want her to revolve around her schedule.  That's NOT reasonable considering it's a dorm, where everything there has different schedules.", "This is extremely unreasonable. And depending on where you live, it\u2019s also not legal to just show up. Here it\u2019s illegal for maintenance to just drop in without 12 hours notice \u2014 in my lease it claims there will be 24 hours notice, unless it\u2019s an emergency but my landlords are awful so maintenance does just show up & I don\u2019t let them in. The reason I don\u2019t let them in is because in a previous apartment, maintenance dropped by unexpectedly, WHEN I WAS IN THE SHOWER WHICH HE HEARD RUNNING WHEN HE BARGED IN, because he knew I lived alone & work remotely and \u201cwanted to get to know me better\u201d. Started going to the office because I was terrified, which was a huge hassle since it\u2019s a 20 min walk there with all my work stuff & technology and everything. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, it\u2019s your living space and there are still standards for how you should be treated. It\u2019s especially alarming to me that this man is showing up at 6am, when it\u2019s probably still dark, angrily knocking & demanding to be let into your bedroom. Please talk to student services, the Dean of students, the Title IX office if there is one, whoever can tell the Housing department that they\u2019re being ridiculous, invasive, and aggressive towards you.", "Dean of students is the right place to start. This is a student safety issue and the implication that students should miss class to deal with dorm maintenance isn't going to fly unless this is a truly shit tier school.", "I also did the dorm staff dance in college.\n\nI'm also baffled that Maintenance doesn't have a master key, or can't get a key from the front desk or w/e. Something about all of this just sounds...off.", "That actually makes sense, but I still don't understand why it specifically needs to be during a class. \n\nWas the cruelty the point or something? Do they just not care that this is the kind of demand that hurts the university, and thus their job security? *Bizarre* play.", "Often people keep something to themselves because thry think they're alone, and the 1st announcement may break a deadlock\n\n> I'd certainly mention that the residential staff asked you to skip class\n\nThat sticks in my craw too, so obviously stupid, and it's personal since one of my coworkers was out recently to let a repairman in (to a noncollege apartment, but still a similar situation)", "I had a neighbor with a homemade sign that said trespassers welcome we could use the target practice and it had a depiction of a gun. They were almost always undisturbed", "6am is too early for pizza (for me anyway). Coffee and muffins or donuts better be on the other side of the door.", "Every Wednesday morning??\n\nThat's nuts. I would have absolutely complained. We had one drill per semester, unannounced. Fire alarms tested once a week, not requiring a response.\n\nI even came early once to help run a fire drill of a giant student hall and let me tell you that the staff don't want to be there either. What on earth your halls were doing, I have no idea. It sounds exhausting. No sane manager wants to be doing that every week.\n\nIt's also counterproductive. If students get used to it and become apathetic and resentful about being forced to stand out in the cold every week, they might not respond when it's the real thing.", "Well, the RA gave OP the time first, and that's when OP said she had class. So it really seems to be a matter of the RA just doubling down instead of being reasonable because they want to be a hard-ass. Also, sometimes people enjoy these jobs because they enjoy exercising power over other people. A \"tiny people lording over tiny kingdoms\" type of situation.", "Is it picture of white Jesus or brown Jesus. Asking for a friend.", "Always white jesus though", "I didn\u2019t know there was anywhere Mormons didn\u2019t go door to door.", "Where I live, they wander around our high street and try to stop people. They're a pain in the arse.", "Heh. Not sure we ever had drills, but we had several false alarms (spider crawling in to smoke head) at 3am. It was always amusing to spot all the people that didn't live in the building.", "Maybe boomers are more likely to remember traveling salesmen, treating unexpected guests as such an annoyance", "You hate me because of when I was born.", ">and where it is stored\n\nNot just elderly women, I know grown ass men who will straight up tell you every detail about their entire arsenal. I understand wanting to talk about your firearms, they're fun and cool to talk about, but who tf outs themselves on their whole armory lol", "It is somehow still too early in the day but I feel like the idea of using a weapon as a deterrent should be obvious.", "The single time I humored a JW they called me a slut within about a minute of opening the door because I was wearing jeans. \n\nThe Mormons offered to rake my leaves and gave me a cinnamon bun.", "Not trying to change your mind about JW's but just to provide some perspective. My husband was born and raised a JW, his father's side goes back several generations, and his mother was converted before he was born.... JW's typically aren't nice to chat with because they are required to go door to door for their entire lives and they're often shit on by the public when they do. It's basically a second job, where they're required to get in a certain amount of hours a month, and only if you somehow become too disabled to conitnue can you stop.   \n\n\nMormons, or Mormon missionaries, are only required to go door to door for maybe a couple of years of their lives and then they're done (it's a lot easier to be nice and excited about what you're doing when you're not 50 years old with 45 years of service under your belt). They're also encouraged to perform acts of service because it paints them in a positive light and makes people more likely to listen to their religious crap, while also counting towards their service hours. By and large, they're not doing it because they're kind, they're doing it because it's a recruitment tactic and to get out of going door to door as much as possible. Mormons, like JW's, are in a cult, and both cults cause incredible harm to their members. Neither group deserves more kindness than the other.  \n\n\nMy husband was threatened with guns, had dog shit thrown at him, was physically assaulted, had a number of people attempt to run him over, and so on. His congregation had to frequently modify routes due to the violence and hostility thrown at them, and they lived in a nice area. So no, they're not nice to talk to, because many of them are fucking depressed (not a surprise considering they're in a high control doomsday cult) and the public is pretty horrible to them, which also feeds into the \"us vs them\" mentality that is hammered into them.  \n\n\nThere has been a bit of a push recently to end door to door service, but there has been no progress on it. There's a reason why those carts on street corners and in subway stations filled with JW magazines have become so common (at least in larger cities), as its a loophole to get them out of having to knock and either be ignored entirely or, often enough, treated like shit.   \n\n\nThe JW religion is a cult that has harmed and continues to harm its members. Most of the members, though, are decent people that don't deserve to be treated like they are while fulfilling an obligation. My husband has told me many, many times that one of the only things that kept him sane during that time was the rare person that opened their door, greeted them politely, maybe even offered them a drink or snack and otherwise treated them kindly. It was also part of what made him question what he was taught.  \n\n\nYou don't have to go out of your way to be nice to them but being cruel is never acceptable.", ">I'm atheist now thank god.\n\nlol, I see what you did there.", "White Jesus", "Yea they have never come to my door.\nDon\u2019t know if it\u2019s all of Canada or just my area.\nOnce a guy on a motorcycle showed up at a neighbour\u2019s place alone and told her he was a Mormon missionary. That was creepy.", "Haha yessss Girl Scouts gets a pass at my house but ever since I moved into the city I get so many solicitors. Last time my husband answered the door someone trying to scam us so my pregnant ass told them to learn to read our \u201cno soliciting sign and to get lost\u201d ugh!", "The 70s were significantly more violent. Like, yes, US gun laws, which we can't do anything about short of armed insurrection, are stupid. But comparing now to the 70s and saying the 70s were better is completely false.", "Many, many, more than ever successfully defend themselves, kill themselves, kill a child accidentally, have the gun used by a child to kill another child, have the weapon used against them. When you let anyone buy a gun people die unnecessarily.", "They totally helped us move", "This is the One True Answer", "100% \n\nI'm not mormon but I live deep in the Jello belt and they do not go out that early.", "I think this is a really lovely comment. It's good to also remember JW/Mormons may not always belong to thier religion. Being rude and nasty certainly isn't going to help them re-think things, it just reinforces what they are led to believe. Being at least polite may go farther than one might think.", "You hate people because of when they were born. That makes you a bigot.", "Gun ownership was in decline then", "That'd irrelevant to the person I'm talking to. He is saying you should want to hide the fact that you have a gun to better protect yourself. I'm saying that if you actually have a gun I don't see why that is a given. I'm not saying you or anyone else should have a gun in the first place.", "As a former missionary myself, I also doubt they were actual Mormon missionaries. Missionaries live on a schedule and respecting the people we contact is a big part of what we do. 6:30 am is typically when they get up, followed by Bible study. In most areas, missionaries don\u2019t leave their apartments until 8:30 or 9, unless there is a specific thing scheduled.", "The next paragraph is completely made up, as a possible explanation.\n\nThis missionaries had been meeting at normal times with the person for weeks and felt that they had a positive rapport with them.  Then life happens and they lost contact but felt comfortable enough with the person to attempt to reestablish contact with the person before they left for work in order to make an appointment at an appropriate time.", "Which was probably a bad thing, given how dramatically much more violent the 70s were compared to now.  \n\n\nThough not a surprise that there would be less victims if more people have the means to defend themselves.  \n\n\nThe accidents and cold blooded shootings are awful, though. :(", "Yes, and so are gun murders now.", "No they are not and the accidental deaths are taking place even more often.", "Daughter to Catholic father: \"Don't eat so much dad; don't you know your body is a temple?\"\n\nFather to daughter: \"No dear, my body is a church. Full of bread. And wine. And guilt.\"", "That's all right, it doesn't matter. You'll never see them again. Burglars generally don't want to have anything to do with dogs -- not because they're afraid of being bitten, but because barking dogs draw the attention of humans, who have phones and, sometimes, weapons.\n\nThere is **nothing** you can do to prevent a sufficiently determined burglar from breaking into your house. All you can do is make your house a less desirable target than others nearby -- and having a dog that barks at strangers is the first and most important step in doing that."]}
