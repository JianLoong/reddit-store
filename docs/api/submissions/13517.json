He\u2019s been crazy about her. Apparently they\u2019ve been dating for a year before he decided to have her meet us officially. \n\nWhat he\u2019s told us about her all seems great: she just got her degree, was enjoying her job, family-oriented, etc., I\u2019m honestly just glad he\u2019s happy with her. My husband and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever been this into someone before, so I feel pretty bad about what I did. \n\nLast weekend, he brought her over for dinner. By now we\u2019d been anticipating meeting her with how much our son has been gushing about her. How perfect she is, that she\u2019s \u2018the one\u2019, in his words.\n\nThey ring the doorbell. We open the door. She looks exactly like her pictures, which is a great start. My son is grinning ear to ear - another great start. We invite them in. She accepts my hug and a firm handshake from my husband, and then she opens her mouth: \n\n  \u201cI\u2019m the one your son puts his penis in.\u201d \n\n  To be frank, I was appalled. I expected my husband to laugh (both he and my son are jokesters, and as annoying as it can be I love it) but THIS was just too much for me. Maybe I\u2019m reserved, but of all things she could have shared about my son she told us THAT. One look at my face and my husband knew how much I disapproved. \n\nMaybe I let my expectations get too high, and it\u2019s unfair to have them, but I reiterate: of all things to say to her boyfriend\u2019s parents - whom she\u2019d never met - she chose THAT? My son was amused at first but when he noticed my reaction his face dropped. \n\nI felt like he\u2019d sold me the full package, everything he\u2019d always been looking for in a girlfriend. I was too disturbed by the visual it put in my head, and it translated into anger. I told her to get out, and I wanted to say more about how gross it made me feel but I fortunately left it at that. My son didn\u2019t want to go, insisting I give her another chance, but I was too fed up and uncomfortable by this point. Even my husband, who\u2019s enjoyed his fair share of raunchy jokes, wouldn\u2019t let up. \n\nThey left and I immediately felt guilty. This was something my son had really looked forward to and I feel like I took that away over a dumb joke. I tried calling to apologize but he hasn\u2019t responded. My husband thinks she\u2019s the one who should apologize. I\u2019m considering giving her another chance, but before I do, was I the AH?", "created_utc": 1680129259, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12631ba/aita_for_kicking_my_sons_girlfriend_out_of_our/", "score": 10459, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or say that, EVER.\n\nLike, seriously? You opened the door and that's what flies out of her mouth?\n\nWas she nervous? Did she seem embarrassed at all? Did she try to apologize? Is there anything that could explain her inappropriate outburst?\n\nYou apologized. Wow. Hats off to you.\n\nNeither of you can do anything to change what happened, and it's up to her to accept the apologies or not. Don't beat yourself up. If she is decent at all, she'll understand. If she's not, then maybe good riddance?\n\nEdit: If she doesn't call back to apologize, or explain (if there's anything to explain), I hope your son dumps her, and also, good riddance. It's more than what she said, if you apologized it's also about her desire to meet you in the middle, you the mother of the boyfriend she loves. Grace goes both ways, you extended yours by apologizing, if she was offended, she should do the same.", "NTA. This just doesn\u2019t sit right. You said your son was all big smiles and amusement when they arrived and up until he son realized you weren\u2019t all that impressed. You also said he jokes around like that with his dad\u2026 \nWhat are the chances it was your sons idea all along and she just (regretfully) went along with it? \n\nBecause if that\u2019s the case, you probably can\u2019t get ahold of him because he\u2019s doing damage control with his girlfriend who\u2019s now mortified and angry that his *super funny joke* gave you the worst impression of her that she could imagine.", "I can't call the girlfriend an asshole, but I am going to call her stupid! Have a fresh start in a couple weeks time and when you open the door just say \"Hi, I'm the woman who pushed your boyfriend out of my vagina!\"", "NTA.\n\nI am the biggest jokester around. I love inappropriate jokes. I love making people cringe. But there's a time and place and reading the room. I would NEVER do that as my first impression with my partner's parents. If into the evening we're all getting along, sure maybe we'll get there and we'll all have a laugh, but not as the first words out of her mouth.\n\nDid you react well? No. Do I blame you? Nope.\n\nDid she even try to apologize before leaving? Like read the room, saw and heard you shooing her away, and did she go \"OMG I totally started this off poorly and that joke was wholly inappropriate. I am SO sorry?\"?", "NTA. \n\nI think you guys just need a do over. She may have been nervous or thought it would go differently.\n\nI can't say that's ever a line that should be uttered, but it's not something to permanently damage your relationship with your son and his partner.\n\nShe should apologize, but I don't know if she will. Hopefully, years from now, you guys will all laugh about how awkward the start of your relationship was.", "NTA. not sure why anyone thinks that this is an acceptable thing to say to your boyfriend\u2019s parents the FIRST time you meet them. i understand she was likely nervous, but that doesn\u2019t make this any less of a weird thing to say", "I did the kicking out, not my husband. He shouldn\u2019t take the fall for this. I don\u2019t think I said I expect an apology (because I don\u2019t). But if I did, sorry for the confusion.\n\nAlso the picture thing is because they met online and my son didn\u2019t have a good one to show us of them together since he hates taking pictures. I\u2019ve heard horror stories about people not being who they say they are online, (catfishing, right? I met my husband before social media existed so I\u2019m out of touch about it.) I don\u2019t think he would lie to me about something like that but I guess it\u2019s my own second hand nerves that made me relieved.", "It\u2019s hard to say for sure because I don\u2019t know her that well yet, but I think she was anxious, too much to realize what she said was inappropriate, so if she was embarrassed I couldn\u2019t tell. I also don\u2019t think I gave her much of a chance since it all happened so fast. I\u2019ll try to reach out to my son about it!", "NTA\n\nI mean I totally get why you felt so emotional about that, that's pretty gross to say and I can't speak to your husband/sons joking nature but *that? On the first time she met you*?\n\nJust sheesh.\n\nI'd want an explanation of how that could ever be acceptable conduct. \n\nIf this wasn't some elaborate joke, she's probably a 10 on the crazy scale (which means she's not really relationship material, I can find you the chart)", "I dunno I feel like she was nervouse but even being nervous that is super weird first thing to say to someone's parents. I'm going with NTA because I just can't get my head around how she thought that was an ok thing to say. I guarantee if it was a bf meeting parents for the first time and he said \" I'm the one who sticks his penis into your daughter\" he wouldn't be getting through the front door", "NTA\n\nThat's just incredibly rude of her and telling her to leave was a valid response", "I just can\u2019t imagine a world in which I floated this idea to an SO and they would approve and THEN I would actually say that out loud. Flabbergasted is the tip of the iceberg. NTA", "NTA!  The only one who should feel guilty is your son\u2019s gf.  I wouldn\u2019t be that quick to give her another chance.  She needs to apologize first.  It\u2019s too bad for your son that his girlfriend thinks gross comments are appropriate he first time you meet anyone, let alone your bf\u2019s parents. I\u2019m not sure I could move beyond such an inappropriate comment about my son.", "Came out in an awkward way? She could\u2019ve just said, \u201cnice to meet you.\u201d", "NTA. And you\u2019re being very thoughtful about this. I\u2019m no prude and what she said on a first meeting -  as the first thing she said to you - is gross and inappropriate. (Bringing up sex in an extremely graphic way that makes you visualize your son having sex??? Who does this as a conversation opener???) \n\nEven if she was incredibly nervous, there\u2019s zero excuse for her behavior. \n\nI think it\u2019s great that you want to mend fences with your son and the girlfriend. Your husband is right though - they both owe you an apology. I can tell that if they give it, you\u2019ll accept it and move on. But don\u2019t beat yourself up about your reaction. She was rude and offensive.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA- what a very horrible thing to to say on first meeting.", "NTA, that\u2019s was really rude of her.", "NTA\n\nI love being a shocking \u201cdark humour\u201d person, but even I know you don\u2019t say that as a first line to your partners\u2019 parents!!! That\u2019s disgusting and crass. Let them know you\u2019d love a re-do, but she needs to use her basic manners.", "As a mother of sons, I audibly gasp! I wouldn\u2019t find it funny. Just like I wouldn\u2019t find it funny if a boy my daughter was dating said \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s penis is inside her\u201d. That\u2019s too far. Too much information and I would feel disrespected.", "NTA. She sounds stupid. I\u2019m speechless.", "NTA I think you both owe each other an apology, her for her joke and you for your big reaction. And then wipe the slate clean and have a do over because your son is So Happy with her and you do seem to want to give her a fair shot! Someone else mentioned that hopefully after some time you two will be able to joke about this incident and it will be water under the bridge. Everyone makes mistakes and sometimes we don\u2019t handle it with grace but it\u2019s not an irreparable situation. I wish you the best of luck and I hope she\u2019s turns out to be as fantastic as you hoped", "NTA. It was possibly a harsh reaction but the comment was inappropriate and your emotions are valid. I would hope your son and his gf have some sense to understand why you flew off, but I would try and work with them to start fresh. Her sense of humour is probably a big part of his feelings for her but she needs to learn some initial boundaries.", "NTA\u2026 I\u2019d be disgusted if I were you also \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I feel like you should give her another chance for the sake of your son and explain that sex jokes involving the son are off limits. You know they\u2019re intimate but it\u2019s not something they need to announce", "Curious what did she say after you told her to get out?  Was she embarrassed?  Did she apologize?", "NTA what a weird thing to say!! Could it have possibly been nerves and she wasn\u2019t thinking clearly though?", "NTA - Her comment was just plain stupid. In what world would that ever be appropriate to say to someone you literally just met? \n\nEven if she was extremely nervous, how is that the first thing that comes to her mind? A simple close mouthed smile and silence would\u2019ve sufficed at the minimum. Not telling your boyfriend\u2019s mom about your sex life.", "NTA. That was not the appropriate thing to say when first meeting the parents. You should have a little friendly talk and give her second chance. Just let her know she is welcome, but to use some common sense and discretion. \nI think you actually had the correct reaction, and should not feel guilty.", "Just....wow.  If she had spent weeks thinking about, I don't think she could have found a more tasteless, tacky, inappropriate way to open a relationship with her BF's parents.  That's the kind of thing that leaves bystanders shaking their heads and going \"WTF did she just say?\"  I'm going to go EXH, her far, far more than you.  She might have been nervous, but that's so far beyond the pale that I just can't comprehend how anyone would be expected to roll with it and talk about the weather afterwards.  As they say, you never get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression and she left a total doozy.  But throwing her out was just a bit much.  If you had just walked away and locked yourself in your room for a few minutes to process, that would certainly have made it clear how appalled you were.  Very, very light scold to you because.....  Oh, never mind.  NTA.", "Uhhh, fairly raunchy sense of humor here, but if I had said the reverse of that to my wife's mom the first time I met her, she would not be my wife.", "What you did was the best thing you could do for that moment, could of became much worse.  There is one thing joking saying I'm the future mother of your grandkids but what she said was crude.  Obviously parents know already their kids would be doing things in the relationship but they don't need to  hear about it.  NTA", "Ugh. This is sooooo cringe. I don't know if I would have kicked someone out of my house (I mean, not racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, so it comes in slightly above my kick-out-od-my house threshold), but jeeeeez, I wouldn't ever want to see her again. Ever.", "Was this some kind of a test or something? I have met dozens of boyfriend's parents over the years and have never said anything even close to that! Not even after knowing them for years. Not even to my in-laws who I've had for more than 15 years! There are some things you just don't say.\n\nYou are NTA but I think we all need to figure out why She said it. Maybe she's trying to drive a wedge between you? Is this one of those people that wants to isolate their significant other from their family, so she decided to start right off with being disgusting? That's the question you need the answer to... Why she did it.", "NTA.  \n\nIf that was what her opening line was, I would have lost my shit.  That isn't nervousness, that's classlessness. Nervousness would have been you saying, \"Thank you for coming!\" and her response being, \"I'm fine, thanks, and you?\".  \n\nAs far as I'm concerned, she is the one that needs to apologize.", "NTA / that is really weird for a first meeting", "NTA. She chose to be vulgar and made a terrible first impression. It could have been due to nerves, but that was one of the worst ways to try and lighten the mood. She should be the one to apologize. Give your son space so he can process how incredibly wrong she was.", "Nta. Did I laugh when I read that? Yep! Would I have invited her into my home? Nope, I'd have said cool story y'all can go do that elsewhere. For a first time parent meet I would never in my wildest dreams be like yep, I put my dick in that. In a parallel universe where I might say that I would expect to either get in a fight with her dad or get kicked out of that house for eternity.", "Personally I find what she said was impolite for greeting someone you meet for the first time, let alone the first sentence to say to bf\u2019s parents. \n\nBut tbh the most important things is that she makes your son happy. \nKicking her out for one tasteless joke is \u2026 too much. You can have a word with her later in the house. \n\nNTA but as parents you can handle that better.", "NTA. Who says this ?", "NTA. I\u2019ve said some dumbass things in my time, but never have I said something like that to /my SO\u2019s parents upon meeting them the first time/.\n\nI do recommend you have a convo with your son about this, so he knows why you reacted the way you did. Would you be open to giving her another chance OP?", "Nta", "NTA.  What???  Omg, wtf, I can\u2019t even\u2026\u2026.  I\u2019ve read a lot of things on this sub, but this???  I\u2026.. I have no words.  What was she thinking???", "That's just so AWKWARD.\n\nLike what was she thinking? I think you should definitely give her another chance, let her apologize. Maybe she has a silly sense of humour but that was so inappropriate. Some things you can brush off, but the first thing stated? No.\n\nNTA.", "Youre NTA at all but i really wanna know if she ran that past him or not. Cos if he gave her the green light to drop that as an opener shes still an idiot but id have to put more fault on him", "WTH?\n\nThat is really off putting. I can\u2019t imagine what possessed her to start off a conversation with strangers with that, much less potential in laws.\n\nI\u2019m guessing you telling her to get out was a knee jerk reaction? \n\nCongratulations on your restraint. \n\nI hope your son answers his phone and is willing to answer some questions. Like-does she have a personality disorder? Mental health issues? \nWhy he thought it was funny? How could he have been so off the mark with his expectation regarding your reaction?", "  NTA. i mean, what in the actual hell is wrong with her?! Before you go and start feeling like maybe you\u2019re being uptight, ask yourself whether you think that it would be appropriate to  greet ANYONE that way? A professor, a coworker, a store clerk? So why would it be a totally regular thing to say to her boyfriend\u2018s parents, especially when meeting them for the first time? The only reason I would say to give her another chance is that, in your shoes, I would just be dying of curiosity to see what she could possibly have to say for  herself after this train wreck of an introduction. But DON\u2019T apologize to this ridiculous person.", "NTA\u2026 you have plenty of replies but I love replying to these.\n\nFirst time I\u2019ve EVER had to put my phone down and look away. I\u2019m very very very very open minded and not conventional but LMFAOOO. \nI mean it can be a nerve thing or if she\u2019s anxious and sabotages herself but I certainly wouldn\u2019t want my parents to know(\u2026\u2026) even if I had a kid with this person. Wow!\nI think I would\u2019ve reacted the same\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f", "NTA: and you didn\u2019t need to apologise. Good for you for being willing to give the GF another chance- but she\u2019d better apologise first. \n\nI don\u2019t know what she was thinking, like she\u2019s living in a bad romcom??", "NTA that girl is gross and not funny. I don\u2019t care how nervous she is, that is not something you say. Your son better lay off forcing you to give her another chance. Maybe in some months if they\u2019re still together, but wow that girl is inappropriate. She is the AH, not you.", "NTA. Maybe not the best joke to start with and you may have taken it wrong, but she is a big part of your sons life who makes him happy so I think you should meet her again. This time, maybe everyone apologising to each other as everyone has their feelings hurt and starting again. Your son has given you a great picture of her, and he would have given her a great picture of you and your husband, so I feel this is one big misunderstanding that can easily be resolved.", "NTA she's old enough to know better", "NTA honestly, I think this was her marking her territory, telling you she outranks you because she fs your son. Poorly played on her part. I wouldn't apologize, she will be a dil from hell", "ESH.\n\nThe gf made an inappropriate joke. I don\u2019t know why. Possibly her family makes those kind of jokes so she thought it\u2019d be fine. Maybe your son put her up to it. Maybe they both agreed it\u2019d be funny. It crossed a line for you and that\u2019s fine.\n\nBut kicking her out so quickly was a complete overreaction. Ignoring it and just carrying on like it didn\u2019t happen or even just pointing out the inappropriateness of it would have been fine. But your reaction was too much.", "NTA. Holy sht, I love a good crude joke but jebus that is insanity to say something like that to 1) someone\u2019s parents and 2) someone you have never met. I hope your son mends fences and you can start over.", "I\u2019m not the best with social cues but that\u2019s fucking gross. You don\u2019t talk about the sexual acts you engaging with your partners parents ,especially not when you first meet them. Who in their right mind thinks that\u2019s an OK thing to say?NTA", "I really wish I had said that to my husbands uber religious parents, but I lamely said, \"I'm Jen. Nice to meet you.\"\n\nAhhhh regrets.", "What did I just read. That is SO inappropriate to say at a first meeting of someone\u2019s parents. Jesus I\u2019m 41 and my husband would never say to my dad \u201chey I hit that!\u201d Wow. NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. There are certain customs when meeting the parents: wear decent clothes, be polite, try to make a good impression. I don\u2019t know if she was nervous or just blurted out the first thing that came to mind, but what she said was incredibly inappropriate. You should give her an opportunity to apologize, but your son should understand that you are not in the wrong here. His girlfriend is.", "Holy shit. Wtf says that!?!?!\n\nI would give them a do over but right now - NTA", "NTA..\n\nMaybe it was nerves or maybe she was trying to break the ice, but DUDE she did it completely wrong!!\n\nIt\u2019s a real bummer because I know you wanted to like her especially since your son is very much crazy about her, but she majorly messed up.\n\nYou\u2019re very generous to consider giving her a second chance, but she really ought to apologize to both you and your husband for her tasteless remark\u2026", "NTA. People who make sex jokes about someone\u2019s family member are just disrespectful and frankly gross. I hate when my SIL makes jokes about her and my brother having sex, and she always slaps his rear in front of me, my sister and my mom. It\u2019s not okay, especially when this was your first time meeting\u2026 but your comment about her looking like her picture is a good first start is weird. You seem to have a checklist on who and what your son\u2019s girlfriend should be like, and that\u2019s not cool and shallow.", "NTA\n\nTotally tacky and inappropriate!", "Yah. I could not apologize to her or son. Let it cool off for a while.  If he wants to explain let him do so but I would not make the first move here.  NTA.", "I'm going to go with ESH.\n\nHear me out, I am ONLY giving that judgment because what she said was very inappropriate. Maybe I'm a prude but to me, you don't say \"I'm the one your son puts his penis in\" as a greeting to someone's parents the first time you meet them. My family joke when meeting someone for the first time but it's never by saying something that vulgar. That should come after you get to know someone better first.\n\nKicking them out over it was a bit extreme though. She may have been told about your husband's sense of humor and used it to break the ice or she could have run it by your son and he could have told her it would be ok. Without talking to her or your son, there is no way to know for sure why she thought to say something like that. \n\nPersonally, I would message your son something along the lines of: \"I just want to apologize for how I reacted. While I find what she said to be highly inappropriate, I could have handled the situation better. Moving forward, I would like another chance to get to know her and hopefully start off on a better foot\". If they don't respond, don't pressure them but give them a chance to make the next move.", "NTA. Her comment was pretty rude for a first time encounter.", "NTA Of all the things she could have said and she says that? Well we know where her brains are at. She owes you a major apology. I would have immediately thrown her out as well.", "NTA\n\nWas the a great joke?  Yes!  Was it the right time to tell the joke?  No!  Comedy is 90% timing and knowing your audience and she has to eat an \u201cL\u201d there. Apologize if you want, but I would just suggest a do over with a clean slate.", "Nta, but for all we know your son talked about how much of a joker you guys are or at least your husband and he could have even been the one who told her it was a great idea and she figured hell let\u2019s give it a go. I don\u2019t think she was wise for saying it but we can\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t coerced into it. I hope it works out. I actually laughed out loud reading it though. Just not something I\u2019d ever say to anyone I am meeting for the first time", "Should of told the girl let's go to your parents place and say that to the father and see what would he say.", "NTA.  She is just plain crass.  If this is what she says on the first meeting, what on earth will fly out of her mouth when she knows you better?  I wouldn't say that to my MIL no matter how well I know her or  how open minded either of us are because there are some things you just don't say.", "NTA. WTH was she thinking.  How crude and rude.  I have 4 boys and I would have been just as angry.  Time and place.  This was neither.  Was she raised by wolves?", "NTA - don\u2019t apologize. She\u2019s disgusting.", "NTA.\n\nShe was clearly raised in the dirtiest barn out there. Your son better pull his head out of his ass and dump this terribly classless girl\u2014NO WOMAN WOULD EVER SAY THIS IN THE FIRST 30 SECONDS OF MEETING THEIR SO\u2019s PARENTS.\n\nShe\u2019s disgusting and she better not try to come back to your house UNLESS SHE HAS AN APOLOGY. Your son better apologize too.\n\nGross.", "NTA, I would have grossed out. Yes, your son is an adult, but in your eyes, he's still a kid. What she said was out of place, and even if your son told her to say it. Common sense should have told her not to.", "NTA!!! She's pretty delusional if she thought that was 'humour'.", "The son HAD to have put her up to it. OP, PLEASE update us after you speak with him. I hope this is whst happened, at least.", "NTA. WHO tF does that? That\u2019s so weird\nAnd disrespectful to YOU.", "NTA She is disgusting.", "NTA. Do not apologize.  If he wants trash instead of class fine, but do not expect others to clean up after him.", "NTA. What she did was disrespectful, immature, crude and vulgar. Not anything a sane person would say upon first meeting of their partner\u2019s parents. She owes you a massive apology. Personally think she was doing a powerplay to assert her dominance.", "NTA but I really want an update on this when it happens \ud83d\ude05\n\nI feel like your son put her up to it thinking dad would laugh, you\u2019d nervously laugh, and it\u2019d break the ice. Then it backfired, he panicked, she\u2019s mortified, and now he\u2019s trying to convince her not to leave him. \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA. That girl ain\u2019t got a lick of sense.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to tolerate this level of disrespect in your own home from a supposedly grown woman, regardless of what she lets into her privates.", "NTA. She is too old to think this shit is funny, cringe af", "NTA What could she have been thinking of to make a statement like that? I know my BF says all kinds of wild things when he's nervous or uncomfortable, but he would NEVER say something like that to my family, especially knowing how important first impressions are. I'm super curious what industry she works in; not that it's an excuse for bad manners, but sometimes it influences our default responses.", "I can understand not liking the comment from the gf, but kicking her out? Nah - not okay. \nI would have led with either joking back or saying, probably not the first thing we should talk about. I think you overreacted.", "NTA. This explains why he waited so long to introduce you. She may have some neurological diversity that makes her blurt things or struggle in social situations. Or she might\u2019ve just panicked.", "I feel like there\u2019s something about the way this is worded that is making me feel some\nType of way. I get that that is a super weird thing to say to a so\u2019s parents you\u2019re meeting for the first time but the way you\u2019re talking makes it honestly seem like she needed to pass some test or something that was pass or fail so I think ESH", "NTA.  Yeah, that 'joke' was custom made and delivered to destroy any hope of a relationship between you and her. Your expectations were not too high, I have no clue what her end goal was with this at all.", "ESH\n\nShe made a big misstep with that joke but you totally overreacted. She wasn\u2019t deliberately trying to insult you, she said something really stupid and inappropriate in an ill-advised attempt to break the ice. You went totally nuclear because you were planning on her being a perfect person and it turns out she\u2019s not, she made a mistake. It\u2019s a pretty big clanger of a mistake but still just a mistake. And given that your son was laughing, he\u2019s obviously given her the impression that that kind of talk isn\u2019t a big deal (either explicitly or implicitly). You mentioned that your husband makes off colour jokes and you laugh it off - it\u2019s possible that your son has mentioned that \u201cI get my sense of humour off my dad\u201d and she thought that made it the norm for your house. She shouldn\u2019t have done, but a shocked look and a gentle correction would have mortified her and made sure she didn\u2019t do it again. Throwing her out of the house without even a chance to apologise? Way over the top.", "NTA. Maybe she was trying to make a smashing impression and the \u2018smashing\u2019 the wrong approach. I say give her another chance. You raised your son and trust him. Trust his judgement, count it as a mulligan and try again", "NTA. That is vulgar and disrespectful. Who leads with something like that?", "NTA you don\u2019t have to tolerate disrespect in your home and making a crude sexual joke to you about your son is disrespectful. She needs to come back once she has learned some manners", "Damn, that was funny, I would have enjoyed that but your house, your rules. Maybe she was nervous? But she should know better and know her audience so Idk.. ima just go with NAH", "YTA. She just has a since of humor with no tact on when to use it. You could have let the night continue and see how it transpired before kicking her and your son out. Sure, it wasn't a great first thing to say, but shit if I wouldn't have laughed my ass off. Maybe that was why your son was smiling ear to ear. He has a girlfriend that let's him put his penis in her. If you want grandkids that needs to happen at some point in his relationship anyway. At worst it was a TMI moment, at best it is a hilarious story years down the road; but since you kicked them out, don't expect him to bring any future girlfriends over to meet you.", "NTA. I'm one for jokes too. I often make toilet jokes with my own bf, but that's where the line is drawn. I'd be so mortified if, on my first meeting no less, I told my partner's mother exactly what she told you. If she was just nervous and blundered, i do hope you give her another chance. People under pressure can do some pretty stupid things.", "At least she said it rather than showing.", "Hilarious joke but the timing was off. NTA", "It was a super inappropriate comment, but it\u2019s also true? Maybe just say something like, \u201cwell, he came out of my vagina, so now we\u2019re all caught up!\u201d NTA", "NTA there's a time and a place for everything. When you're meeting your boyfriend's parents be polite respectful and be nice and don't tell jokes like this.Tell them you'd like a do over..... without the jokes.", "ESH.\n\nI kinda suspect she made such a doofy crass joke out of anxiety. Sounds like your son was putting a lot of pressure on this meeting.", "NTA what the hell, she wasn\u2019t raised right. I\u2019d love to know how she possibly thought that would be ok. Like you wanted that visual of her and your son \ud83e\udd22.", "Whoa that was a terrible joke! Is there a chance your son told her you were jokesters and maybe she picked this -awful- joke to try to fit in?  I don't know honestly what kind of reaction I would have had but this sounds like a case of ESH. \n\nI would just say, talk to your son and try to give it a new go, perhaps in a more neutral place, like a restaurant?", "ESH. But your reaction was much more understandable than what they did. I'd say give her another chance only because of how much it seems like your son put her up to it lol.", "Ahhhhhhhh I don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve kicked her out but she also definitely shouldn\u2019t have said that\u2026\u2026.. very weird icky joke.

He probably would\u2019ve gotten kicked out tbh so like I guess ESH/nta", "It wasnt even funny like huh\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "I\u2019m appalled by what she said, but maybe the reaction was also quite strong. Thinking about it, I think the first meeting should\u2019ve been in a public place. It\u2019s just extra icky having to be in your own house and hear that, because you can\u2019t choose to leave. I would\u2019ve asked her to repeat herself in a stern tone as to signal that I\u2019m not okay with that kind of language in my house. Soft ESH.", "Well THAT was a doozy! NTA but I'd give her a second chance.", "The comment was out of line, but you just put your son in a place where he feels he needs to choose between his family and his GF making YTA.", "Sorry, but I am going with YTA. It was crude and stupid but they are young people still at a point of thinking shocking is cool, and you are an adult and you have an opportunity to give grace here. I would write her an apology, for letting your shock and disgust become anger and hoping that you all can move past that awkward beginning because of the happiness you see in your son.", "HAHAHA. Yeah, her comment was super inappropriate but so was your reaction. You want a relationship with your son, learn to keep your feelings to yourself. Lots of people get nervous and screw up the first meeting with the parents. Relax and try again. ESH", "I don't know. As tasteless and idiotic as that was to say - couldn't you have just said something instead of going right to \"get out\"!?

Honestly, even if you try to brush this under the rug and move past this, you've already given a gigantic red flag for this girl, so in the future she'll probably always be waiting for the next time something set you off and you go nuts.

Son put gf up to it because he thought oh hilarious that\u2019ll def break the ice?!

Yuck.", "I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 6 years and I could not fathom saying this to his mother, even though we\u2019re close and we always joke around.

He may have told her his father was a jokester so she thought it'd be ok, they may have come up with the joke together, I feel like it's probable even, and she may have just been SUPER nervous and had a brain fart.\n\nThere could be a host of different reasons she said that, assuming it was definitely what she wanted and intended to say isn't fair in my opinion. Letting them stay and apologize or explain would have been the fair thing to do, just telling her to get lost immediately is a bit harsh I think. There's just not enough information and context here for me to say either way, so I'm going with NAH for now.", ">I'm pretty liberal, and open minded, but \n\nYou're clearly not then lol", "Liberal and open minded my ass.

Before even \"Hi, nice to meet you\"?", "I am thinking the same, but the son should have said immediately, he told her to say that.", "100% thinking the same thing.

Why wouldn\u2019t the son immediately clarify right then and there he planned it.", "This was the first thing that came to my head... He told her to say it. It blew up in her face, which made her look like a fool. She probably fought it and fought it, and now it's likely going to implode the relationship.\n\nOP should breach this thought process with her son if he's avoiding responding... to give an opening. And also offer to give her a second chance. It may both save their relationship (giving the girlfriend a chance to save face, and them a chance to save what they have).", "But the dad didn't seem happy either.", "That crossed my mind as well. \n\n\nBut I can\u2019t imagine ever actually saying that to a boyfriend\u2019s parents.", "There is nothing my boyfriend could say to convince me to say THAT as the first words I ever speak to his parents.

If either of them thought that this was a good idea, you'd have to question their maturity and judgement.", "If the son got the gf to do this, what does that say about her? Really really poor judgement on her side if she went along with the joke. I don\u2019t think I could ever have any kind of relationship with her if it were me.", "That would be hilarious but I think we\u2019ve all had enough of the genital-related jokes lol.

This is the one.", "This is the way, OP. This is damage control. Clean slate lol", "Yes!! This is PERFECT!", "Exactly, was there an \u201coh shit\u201d moment from the gf and the son? Like, as soon as the joke missed the landing they should have been apologizing and backtracking. They should have owned up to how inappropriate something like that is. \nIf they doubled down then OP was well within her rights to kick her out. If they did start to apologize then I feel like OP should have given her a second chance.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine, in any world where anyone would think that was an appropriate introductory sentence.", "I honestly don\u2019t think I gave her enough time to react properly, and I regret that. Things could have gone a lot smoother if I had. She was just sort of frozen in shock, and she kept looking at my son to try to convince me not to kick her out. I guess she wasn\u2019t sure what else she could say at that point.", "I have THE most inappropriate humor. To the point where after I had my first born child the first thing I said when my husband brought her over to me, I said \u2018See, I told you she was yours!\u2019 And we both busted out laughing while the medical team was frozen. \nI would NEVER do this joke.

Who just opens their mouth and says something this messed up?", "You deserve an apology. That's a joke for meeting his friends, not his mom and dad.", "Her humor and behavior is likely a reflection of your son's. He clearly thought it was funny until he saw your disapproval, so I'll bet he's the type to make the same kind of joke to her parents at a first meeting. If you're judging her for this you should judge your son as well. Birds of a feather.", "So, you suspected she was dishonest despite your son liking her so much and having zero valid reason? Definitely YTA - and very shortsighted.", "NTA. I\u2019d talk to son but don\u2019t assume anything or guilt. Ask him what happened? Find out who\u2019s idea it was? \nDon\u2019t apologize for your reaction. What she did (regardless of who\u2019s idea or why) was inappropriate for a first meeting.

Together.", "I\u2019m sorry but how does someone not know that\u2019s inappropriate!?!?! I\u2019m super liberal and open about everything but I would NEVER EVER say that to my in laws and we\u2019re MARRIED. And like. Have kids so they KNOW haha! Talk about kids and trying to have kids, yes, but P in V???? No. Not explicitly. And not when first meeting them??? \n\nI do agree with the do-over and trying to get by it. But also NTA at all.", "NTA. I\u2019d kick out son\u2019s bf/gf or daughters bf/gf until a sincere apology is made.

If you could pull off a southern drawl for it, it would have potentially made me pee my pants a little.", "I am so, so curious what her demeanor was when she was told to leave.\n\nAlso I just can\u2019t imagine what she could have expected from you", "I wouldn't ask or offer an apology at this point, just reach out and suggest \"let's have a do over\". Reading between the lines I think your son put her up to it - or at least okayed it in advance. I'd call it a super awkward and bad joke, and I'm feeling for her right now.", "I get eating your words when your anxious but making gross sex jokes to your partners parents you\u2019ve JUST met goes far beyond nerves. \n\nI think she might be an idiot or just a crude person. Either way, there is nothing to apologize for you just need to start over again.", "I feel like based on op son smiling about it. That he talked about their sense of humor and her being nervous lend to that joke.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s crazy lol. But\u2026 there\u2019s a chart?!", "There\u2019s a chart?!?", "It has me wonder if the son knew she was going to say it and told her his folks would find it a hilarious ice breaker or something?", "Thank you! I\u2019m hoping for the best!", "In retrospect, I say it probably was bad nerves. She didn\u2019t seem nervous, but I know anxiety wears many faces, not to mention I don\u2019t know her that well yet.", "I\u2019d love to give her another chance! Just as long as I\u2019m not given any more graphic visuals (especially at dinner). I hope she\u2019s willing to try again.", "He\u2019s not forcing me to give her another chance, I WANT a do-over. I think we all deserve it. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll make another joke like that again.", "in some months? They\u2019ve already been together for a year, according to OP. If son likes her that much, she deserves another chance. And either way, parental opinions don\u2019t matter that much. Son can easily go no contact if he wants so I\u2019d be careful.", "Yeah, have to kind of agree with this. It was very inappropriate, but I do wonder if maybe she had anxiety and it just came spewing out. I think of the time I met my husband's parents for the first time and I knew he was the one, and I wanted them to like me SO badly. So, I of course didn't hardly talk the whole night because I was so nervous lol  And maybe for her it was the opposite and she just said to much. I do understand where she is coming from, but it may have been a bit harsh. However, that is just my opinion", "I think this is a bad take. If the first thing the GF does is disrespect the parents than she needed to go until she could apologize and fully grasp the inappropriateness of what she did. No parents want to have their kids sexualized in front of them and hardly any people want a stranger to approach them and talk about sexual experiences. This is sexual harassment at a minimum.   \n\n\nOP NTA. An overreaction would be screaming and carrying on. Asking someone you don't know that just disrespected you the second they meet you to leave is a reasonable and measured response. Nerves cannot excuse this at all. There is just common courtesy that dictates how one should behave around strangers. No cultures to my knowledge would find this acceptable and would likely take much more offense. Because what she said is incredibly offensive. I wouldn't be able to ignore it if this was said about my daughter, I would 100% expect a genuine apology later.", "I think the comment about her picture shows my age, sorry. My son didn\u2019t show us pictures of them both together and I was nervous about her being who he said she was. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019d lie about it, but it definitely was something I was subconsciously worried about. I don\u2019t have any criteria for my kids\u2019 spouses when it comes to how they look.", "How is this a joke at all?", "In retrospect I think she panicked lol", "Would that really be an acceptable excuse? No matter the reason, I wouldn\u2019t want that kind of social ineptitude marrying into my family", "Right? \u201cHe\u2019d sold me the full package\u201d sounds like the son has had to deal with mom\u2019s inappropriate expectations in the past.", "I feel like op son may have led her to believe that was the audience for the joke. If the mom is okay with her husband and son jokes then probably didn\u2019t think anything of someone making them too.", "I\u2019m still laughing at it.", "Yeah I thought op was ott in her reaction. The joke was silly, nothing to clutch pearls over.", "Yeah.  I would have laughed for sure.", "I thought it was funny too.", "Lol I would've laughed \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they aren't kids, they're 24! They're adults and they can joke about sex. This was incredibly over dramatic. If I were the gf I wouldn't even want to go back for a do-over \u270c\ud83c\udffb", "Seriously who does that?", "Well OP isn\u2019t a vulgar person, so this is a no go", "I also think she was a bit nervous, and that it just came out in an awkward way. I\u2019ll try having more patience next time", "I agree I should\u2019ve been more patient about it. I think if we were to try again things will go much smoother, hopefully we can laugh about this later down the line (and leave it at that)", "What about the first impression that OP made? Nobody cares about that?\n\nWhat if she decides that she doesn't want to subject her kids to that woman???", "Finally someone else thats not a stuck up prude that\u2019s uncomfortable with funny sex jokes. I think it\u2019s hilarious. OP said they\u2019ve been dating for a year, obviously they\u2019ve fucked, I think the joke is funny af. My husband has made similar jokes to my mom and I\u2019ve made jokes to his parents well before we got married. I said ESH, but bordering on YTA.", "I agree I definitely could\u2019ve just explained myself. I would have saved everyone a lot of trouble. Thanks.", "Agreed \u2014 I'm surprised not to see more ESHs.\n\nOP was well within her rights to be grossed out and offended, but kicking the girlfriend out feels like a wee bit of an overreaction... but an understandable overreaction, considering the mental images she forced upon you.\n\nTalk to your son, OP \u2014 find out if this comment was, indeed, a case of verbal vomit stemming from anxiety. And see if you can start over. Maybe one day it'll be a hilarious story that you tell family.", "Just\u2026dramatic overreaction. Yeah, it was a bad joke. But it wasn\u2019t malicious. If the son had talked about how his dad makes \u201craunchy jokes\u201d then girlfriend may simply have been trying to break the ice.\n\nIt\u2019s not like she took a shit in the kitchen sink.", "From what he\u2019s told me I\u2019d love to have her as my daughter-in-law", "Wow that could be but why wouldn\u2019t Bf say something before hand? Unless he thought it would be funny if they didn\u2019t know first .", "Why wouldn\u2019t the son say that haha", "Yes 100%! I can\u2019t even begin to understand all the top N.T.A. comments or even the controversial E.S.H. comments. Was it stupid of the gf to say that? Of course, I bet even the gf would agree with that! Was it inappropriate? Yes, but that\u2019s it. There was no malice in her joke whatsoever, but a lot of malice in how OP reacted. If I was the gf, I would think deeply about whether OP\u2019s son is worth having a MIL like her.", "That would be funny, sounds like something my husband might say. But I think the ice is too thin, maybe later down the line if things go over well!", "I agree I definitely should\u2019ve handled it better. But the approval thing is my right to reserve. I\u2019d never strictly prohibit my kids from a relationship they feel fulfilled in but I\u2019m not blindly accepting someone into our family either. Like my son-in-law, she deserves a chance to \u2018prove\u2019 herself to our family. I\u2019m not saying she needs to be particularly impressive or meet strict criteria or anything but I\u2019d like to get to know her without those details she shared.", "Thank you! This is the only reasonable response. Kicking her out over a silly joke is ridiculous. Just ignore it and move on.  They are adults and have a sex life.", "I\u2019m shocked I had to scroll so far down for a YTA reply which is completely agree with.", "Meh, maybe the next GF will have some manners and NOT greet OP for the first time by talking about her son\u2019s  penis. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "What type of justification is the fact that she talks about her sex life in front of her in laws because she was nervous.

His brain isn\u2019t fully formed and he\u2019s driven by hormones. \nThe GF has zero class and that is the impression she left on OP & husband. The GF blew it. Any apologies should begin with the GF.", "So you\u2019re saying you talk to your SO in the same way no matter who is around? Lmao", "I do think he told her something like that, actually. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me. He seemed to find it funny at first, but I think they both realized after she\u2019d already said it that it was not at all the right thing to say. I would have accepted almost any other joke. I think it was mostly directed at my husband, since they share their sense of humor but he had to gauge my reaction first", "I would think being nervous would make her less likely to talk about their son's penis.", "Most people don\u2019t talk about their sex lifes in front of their partner\u2019s parents when they are nervous", "Imagine if it was a guy saying this to his gf parents lmao be for real", "I'd guess it has less to do with her gender, and more to do with the ick factor. I'm guessing OP would be equally squicked and offended if her daughter's boyfriend greeted her by saying, \"I'm the one who sticks my penis in your daughter.\"\n\nPlus the fact that the gf was a virtual stranger, and this is the FIRST thing she chose to say.", "Op didn't say she like men who are jokes jokesters. She said she love when her husband and son do it. \n\nI don't think its because they have a penis but because that's her family.  People tolerate things from their family that they won't from a stranger", "Imagine a young woman introducing a new boyfriend to her parents and he throws out a line like, \u201cI\u2019m the one putting my penis in your daughter.\u201d", "So if you had a 24 year old daughter and she brought home a guy who said \u201cI\u2019m the one who sticks his penis in your daughter\u201d then that would be ok?\n\nIt\u2019s nothing to do with being sexist, it\u2019s just tacky and inappropriate", "Yea bad take.

Imagine a guy said this to his gfs parents yall would have a different opinion", "I'm surprised at how many N T A comments there are here because this seemed like a really harsh reaction to me. My boyfriend has two boys (9 and 11) and I'm trying to imagine this scenario when they're OP's sons age... I gotta say, I probably would've laughed and joked back (\"well that's quite an introduction!\"),and I read this to my boyfriend and he agreed. Maybe it's just because we're pretty laidback in general, but this isn't something that would have deeply disgusted or offended me like it did OP. I think I would chalk it up to her being nervous and I'd give her a chance to redeem herself. Also, they're in their 20s, not like they're in high school, so it's a little silly to be so prude about sex IMO. Was it the best first impression? No. Would we have kicked her out? Also no. We would've let dinner go on and see how it went, then said something privately to the son later on if we had concerns.", "I mean I made dumb comments but never told someone mom \"I'm the man who cums in your daughter\"", "Ah yes im so nervous lets talk about ur sons sex life", "It\u2019s not so much that I was surprised that my son has sex. He\u2019s grown and he\u2019s been out of the house for 6 years, if anything I expect it. I don\u2019t want or need to hear about it though, like at all. I\u2019m sure most people would prefer not to think of their family that way. But I agree that bad nerves do come out wrong. That\u2019s why I\u2019m willing to giving her another chance.

So would mine!", "So, neither liberal nor tolerant then. Jesus fuck, people have sex, and penis is just a word. This lady killed the happiness on her son's face and kicked out the gf as a first resort. That is neither liberal nor tolerant, and if your bf and his family would act the same way, they suck donkey balls. What op did is a ridiculous overreaction to something very small. I would never hurt my kid like this over a word, nor risk losing out on grandkids. Its not just intolerant, it's shortsighted. Op even admits the joke may have been her own son's idea.", "Absolutely! I'd gone off asap, and no apology from me. OP is a better human than I am", "Right?!?!?!", "Agreed", "It wasn't the word.  She was deliberately vulgar and rude the very instant she met his parents.

Maybe he'll learn a lesson about first impressions that will save him some trouble down the road.", "Honestly. Even if it's not true. You'd be doing everyone a favor to bring up to them suspicion that it was your son's idea, which offers them the \"out\" of letting them pretend it was all the son's boneheaded (heh, couldn't help myself) plan.\n\nWhether she... has Tourette's; or panicked in the moment and succumbed to an impulsive thought; or if it was your son's idea, or any number of other things that will be suggested. This would send them the message that the thing they did was both inappropriate and a line was crossed, but also more indicative that \\*she\\* gets a complete do-over, no marks. You're not going to pry further into why it happened because you already have a feasible explanation. Way less guilt and embarrassment in her trying again.\n\nThis will also give you a truer chance to find out if the girlfriend is bad news.

Good luck seeing any grandkids lady.", "Listen I have been higher than giraffe goodies and balls to the wall drunk and never have I ever said anything remotely like that because yikes that's wild. That was totally out of pocket. I might call my MIL and tell her that and see what happens. Lol!", "Probably would if he thought about it, but jokes like that, in my experience, also land differently from women than they tend to from men. \n\nHis mother might laugh when he does it because she knows that\u2019s how he jokes with his dad, but that would be different coming from a stranger and her sons girlfriend.", "Only when he saw how upset his wife is.", "But even worse judgement on his part if he put her up to it.

Not saying it\u2019s right, but she may have just been nervous in the moment and reverted back to what she would normally do.", "Did your son offer an explanation when you kicked her out and he asked for a second chance?  What did she look like after that came out of her mouth (horrified or smirking)? Do you joke around a lot at home and your son played it up to her and she misjudged the situation (horribly misjudged)?\n\nIt's hard for me to say if you were right or wrong to kick them out. I guess it would depend on her reaction after she said it. If she looked mortified or turned red then give her another chance. If she smirked and laughed then asking her to leave makes sense.", "Her opening line obviously was in poor taste. But I don\u2019t know many kids, or young adults, who always make the best decisions. Making mistakes is part of being young. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say YTA, but I do think asking them to leave was an over reaction. \n\nAs a parent myself, I\u2019ve had awkward introductions to my kids friends and dates. In those moments, I take a deep breath, I let All of the anger go with that breath, and I say \u201clet\u2019s try that again. I\u2019m ______, _______\u2019s dad.\u201d And we restart.", "Yep YTA. Don\u2019t expect him to bring someone over again. She made an awkward joke, it doesn\u2019t say a lot about her personality or who she is other than that she\u2019s very open and has an interesting sense of humor. Definitely not a valid reason to kick someone out. It was a joke, an icebreaker. Yes it\u2019s awkward, some people say awkward jokes when they are nervous. Well it\u2019s your house so you do what you want but don\u2019t expect him to be around much", "YTA, Idk everyone here seems kinda stuck up, joke was out of place but I'd try to figure out why it was said before coming to any conclusion", "ESH, she's incredibly rude. Who on earth thinks that's the way you greet your boyfriend's parents? But yes, you did overreact kicking her out. I think probably a gentle reprimand that we don't speak that way in your house would have been sufficient unless she kept up being crass and disrespectful.", "YTA! Now your son and his girlfriend won't want to visit because of the way you handled this. Good luck.", "YTA, but only a little. He probably told her to say a little joke or something to break the ice, and she probably just went full panic stupid upon meeting you guys and whiffed the joke hard.", "YTA\n\nYour son does the dirty, big whoop. Okay, sure, not the best thing she could have said first meeting but you overreacted immensely. You should've just bit your tongue and given her a chance before booting her out immediately.\n\nAlso the people telling your son to dump her over a single comment are why most relationships fail these days. Unrealistic expectations. God forbid anyone make a joke.", "YTA - was that a dumb thing to say? Absolutely. But you blew it into way bigger of a deal than it needed to be. Like many have said, she was probably just nervous. People say dumb stuff sometimes, we should give them grace. I also think your a senior adult who should have the tools to handle things like this with more tact. From your comments you kicked her out before y\u2019all could even hash things out and you could understand. Just seems immature to me. I can\u2019t imagine a world where I ever kick someone out of my house for a comment of that nature, or even raunchier. Like unless someone is being aggressive or repeatedly rude, I just can\u2019t imagine getting so angry I kick a person out. Lead with compassion and try to understand and emphasize. \n\nNot saying I excuse what she said. Absolutely not okay, but I think your TA for how you handled the situation. \n\nYou also put your son in a tough spot and now you\u2019re all agonizing over the interaction. As you noted, hopefully all of you can move on and laugh about this, but seems like your strong reaction made things much worse than the already bad first meeting.\n\nHow can you lead with empathy and compassion? Be the bigger person in all situations, always.", "I'm sorry, it's also on the girlfriend...I was a notorious wild child and if a boyfriend had told me to intro myself to his parents like that, even at my height of hedonistic behaviour, I would've asked him if he was completely insane.\n\nJust no.", "This was my thought too when she mentioned her son\u2019s face didn\u2019t drop until he realized OP wasn\u2019t laughing.", "I suspect son and GF are currently working out if they need to be \u2018on a break\u2019.   \nHoly bat cakes folks, if this is from son\u2026 then GF should be rethinking her relationship with him.   \nIf it\u2019s from GF then son should be doing damage control to his parents, and working out how to mend the bridge.   \nOP has done the right thing and offered a bridge crossing apology\u2026 now it\u2019s up to the other party/s to do their end of the bridge too.", "If that was the case, she should have outed him right away, then looked his mother in the eyes, and apologized. \n\nI\u2019m sure he knows his mother would not find something like that funny.", "I immediately thought the son told his girlfriend to say it. I can\u2019t imagine a young lady would ever lead with that statement.", "LOL this is definitely the way to go", "My guess is the son told her it'd be a good introduction and.. voila", "Unfortunately people who say shit like this intentionally aren't usually interested in meeting in the middle.  This seems like an \"establish dominance\" power play.", "Dude MAYBE I could see myself making that joke out of nervousness but the instant I saw the mother\u2019s face fall I would apologize so goddamn fast and try to explain myself. Also, def not the material to bring the first time you meet your bf\u2019s parents, nay, the first sentence you say to your bf\u2019s parents!", "OP please update us if you go for another try!

My family is pretty raunchy and we'll make sex jokes and comments to people... after we've known them a while and if they're the type of people who like that type of humor.  We definitely don't lead off like that when we first meet people.", "See, I feel like I could be one to say that. Like it would just escape out of my mouth from maybe being nervous and the default is comedy and jokes. And honestly from me, I still don't see myself as that prim and propped to really feel like I'd be offended in any way like that from something like this. And from the little i scrolled I guess I'm not of the same opinion as most on this one. \n\n\nMy verdict will be ESH tho.\nWhile I wouldn't care, some people of course do, and I know that without reading this and so the gf clearly had a foot-in-moth situation. Get to know the people you meet first. Only 10> seconds in first meeting is no good place to fetch the gutter jokes. \n\nI also feel like the reaction don't scale correctly tho. I understand not being comfortable with it and just not being happy and ok with that, but the level of rage and reaction was honestly too much. Give her another chance? I don't think she had a chance. You snagged it away from her immediately.", "Like what the actual f*ck? Was it for shock value? She\u2019s disgusting. That is not awkwardly meeting, that\u2019s being disgusting and disrespectful. Not funny. Was this slunt recording this for her social media and a reaction? Your son owes you an apology and needs to dump that trash. Who does that?", "There's no way she wasn't planning on saying that. She thought about that before she arrived because even if she was anxious or nervous, why would she pick that exact first sentence?

Totally not funny. Should have led with a dick joke.\u201d", "Well, yes. Where do you go from there? You don't just smoothly segue into \"I'm happy to meet you\" or \"Please make yourself at home,\" lol. At the time, neither was true.", "Yes! I am surprised at the reactions in this thread. I am similar age as the OP with also with a 20-something son. What the gf said was inappropriate but not unforgivable.  OP should have ignored the comment (and addressed it later with son) and carried on.", "I feel like I scrolled way too far before I found this. Absolutely agree.", "Yeah, it wasn't like she wore an Iron Maiden t-shirt or something.", "She has a degree. This isn\u2019t some girl who is in highschool and is only impressioned by her parents. This is a girl who has been around adults with PHD\u2019s for 4 years now. You learn professionalism to some kind of degree during college. And first impressions are everything and she apparently didn\u2019t care. \n\nI would have kicked her out for not caring about meeting your boyfriends parents for the first time. Which shows little respect for the son considering it was a big deal for him to finally introduce them.\n\nThough, I would give her another chance considering the importance she is to the son. Evaluate opinions later after an official meet and greet. But that girl needs to be the one to apologize.", "Yeah, I can't defend the gf at all, it's a totally bizarre and inappropriate joke (although, I agree with others that it's possible the son put her up to it), but the blind rage reaction of kicking her out immediately is a weird overreaction. It feels like there's a lot missing from this story and about the family dynamics.", "I\u2019m in my late 20s and have kids and consider myself to be very raunchy. But you have to have the social wherewithal to know better than to say that. And if you think a joke like that is right in that situation I\u2019d be terrified of what else you think is hilarious. That said, was asking them to leave too much? Maybe. But does it make them an AH? Not in my opinion. I can\u2019t think of a time I\u2019ve been so nervous I\u2019d say something to that extent.", "I was surprised at how many people thought kicking the girlfriend out was an acceptable reaction. You can make her know it\u2019s not funny or proper to say without going to that extreme.", "Thank goodness. For a second I thought I was the only one here who thought the kicking out was extreme. Like, someone makes a silly, inappropriate joke and your first instinct is to say 'leave right now'? I dunno, seems harsh to me. Especially since the parents have heard so much about how this girl is the 'one'. Give her a chance, she was probably so nervous. Or else the son put her up to it as a joke.\n\nIf I was the parent, I would've laughed nervously and forgotten about it. This thread is wild. I guess Americans take this stuff more seriously than us (Irish)", "Do people actually think like that? Like I've never met a person who's concerned about where they \"rank\" or feels the need to \"mark their territory\" to their partner's *parents*. I'm not sure that's even remotely the most likely explanation", "I wish I took this approach! Without making too many excuses for myself I can say I got too caught in the heat of the moment.

Very curious to see what they have to say for themselves now!", "Even if he didn't give her the idea, suggesting so will give the girlfriend an out if your son is willing to fall on his sword. I think it's worth a shot to get a redo with the girl your son loves so much.", "This was my first thought when I read it. As a guy who sometimes thinks the stupidest things are funny, I'd wager it was your son's idea on how to break the ice, the gf was nervous and went along in with it, and your son didn't have the backbone to man up and admit it was him.\n\nI say all that because I was that same insecure guy in my younger days.\n\nI'm sure he is doing major damage control with his gf right now.\n\nI hope this doesn't end their relationship, but that's a pretty serious misstep.", "You shouldn't be the one reaching out at this point. Your son needs to own this with his gf and acknowledge it was a VERY bad choice of words no matter how open a person is, that is not the first line. EVER. \n\nIf she didn't mean it, then she should have apologized right away. Your son should know better knowing you and have said to not be inappropriate.\n\nMy guess, he did and she thought she would make a statement and fo for it.\n\nHe may be so embarrassed and not sure how to approach you.\n\nLet him works this out. He needs to act like a 24 yearold and talk to you and not like a child.", "I think it's worth considering that it's possible your son has told his girlfriend about the humor of his family is on the raunchy side and chose this (and chose *poorly*, don't get me wrong) as her ice breaker.\n\nYou presented this situation in your post with a high degree of judgement even from before laying eyes on this woman, so I can see this situation as your son having informed her that she should expect to be judged and be deliberate about her behavior. But at the same time he's probably told her about your husband and what appears to be a dirty sense of humor like his son has (and she has). As you stated explicitly,  your son *and* your husband both laughed at the joke, and you expected your husband to laugh, indicating this kind of joke *is* his kind of humor: her joke landed for everyone but not for you. To me this was an unfortunate mistake on her part, not an attempt to shock you. \n\nI say this to present a possible alternative perspective as to why it happened. She chose to break the ice in a way she figured your husband and you would appreciate, but missed the mark badly overall because she got the wrong impression of how you specifically would take it.\n\nI'm not saying she didn't mess up: I'm with you, she chose a pretty stupid and *shocking* opening line to introduce herself to her partner's parents. A person absolutely shouldn't be introducing themselves so freaking vulgar when they don't know the person they're meeting: such a strong joke was a huge gamble and she lost. But props to you for apologizing for your strong reaction afterwards to help smooth things over. It shows you really care about your son and his relationship, regardless of the infraction.\n\nGood luck.

He should get a taste of his own medicine", ">That would be hilarious but I think we\u2019ve all had enough of the genital-related jokes lol. My son would literally puke if I said that (speaking from experience)\n\nWhich should make it all the more obvious to him that the original joke was wildly out of place.", "So your son would be uncomfortable if you said something like that but not when his gf said something along the same lines.

It's just beyond dumb and disrespectful.  But maybe this IS her. Just cuz your son sees her in rose colored glasses doesn't mean you should. Maybe ask her if she talks like that to her family. Anyways, I wouldn't apologize, I would say we need to talk. If she thinks you're apologizing to her,  she might think you are the Btch and not her behavior. Sorry, consequences.
