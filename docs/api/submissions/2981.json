This year it is my holiday.  My boyfriend and I had planned to have thanksgiving with his family and friends this year and they are coming to our house. I would like my sons (14 and 7) to spend the holiday with them and their little sister.\n\nHowever my ex's sister and brother have kids (their cousins) that they are close to.  The kids are bugging me to let them go over to their house after they spend some time with me so they can go to their thanksgiving because \"my boyfriend's family is boring and weird\"?? Which I find incredibly disrespectful.  My boyfriend has been in their lives for 2 years now and we just moved in with him this year.  My teen in particular has been refusing to bond with my boyfriend, told me he \"looks like Jeffrey Dahmer\" and \"his family is weird and a bunch of rednecks\".  My 7 year old told me that my boyfriend's friends are also weird and ask him weird questions like \"why does he have both a tablet and a nintendo switch\".  My 7 year old is fine with my boyfriend though and my bf is involved with the kids and watches them and takes them to school for me when I work.  I am mostly upset with my teen as he is being unfair to my bf who has been trying hard to talk to him.  Meanwhile they love the shit out of my ex's girlfriend so it's obviously not an issue of not liking significant others of their parents.\n\nAnyway Thanksgiving is a time for family in my mind, and they spent last year's Thanksgiving with their dad's family and cousins.  I told them no, they cannot go and they are to spend the entire day with me and my boyfriend.  Now my older son is throwing a fit and saying he is just going to go to his room and not come out.

Secondly, prioritizing your bf family versus their actual cousins. And if nobody else tells you, I will- trying to force your teen to have a relationship with your bf will not work. the more you push, the more they will withdraw from it. The most you can demand is civility and respect- to the degree that it is also given to them. Punishing him or calling him disrespectful for telling you how he feels about BF family is also a no-no. He feels how he feels. So, now all you've done is tell him not to be honest with you. So, you will be greatly surprised when the whole thing blows up in your face and you had no clue.", "YTA, coparenting is difficult no doubt, but leading with what's best for the child is always best.

Let your kids split the day and enjoy the holiday with their family.  Don\u2019t be selfish - they didn\u2019t ask for divorced parents, new boyfriends/girlfriends/siblings.

Legally, you can say no to them going to the other home. \n\nBut it seems to me that you\u2019re really forcing things. The kids aren\u2019t family to your BF\u2019s relatives. They have told you they don\u2019t feel comfortable. They offered a compromise. Go to BFs for part of the day and go see cousins and family part of the day. \n\nUnless there\u2019s great distance between making it unrealistic, I think you should be more flexible on this.\n\nI (44F) am a step mom and I met the girls when they were 10/11.

Yes, it's rightfully your holiday. And your son isn't asking to spend NO time with you. He's just wanting to also spend sometime with his other side of the fam. He's also told you that if he is forced to spend all day with you guys that he'll just be a recluse  in his room anyway. Why force him and make him miserable just so you can say hey my kid was here with all of us even though he clearly hated it and didn't interact? \n\nMaybe though look into how your 14 year old is and how your BF family/friends are.

If Thanksgiving is indeed a time for family, you should not make your children spend time with people they don't care to spend time with and who are not family. Just because you want your 14-year-old to bond with your boyfriend, it is not going to happen, especially when you try to force the matter. I feel that especially a teenager should have some say in where they spend holidays and who they spend it with. If they don't get that say, it will come back and bite you in a certain part of your body at a later (not much later) date.", "YTA- I am tired of seeing parents dating new people and trying to force their kids to have a relationship with their new partners.   No child or person should ever be forced to have a relationship with anyone.  Just because you love your BF doesn\u2019t mean everyone else has to.  Your son offered a compromise but that wasn\u2019t good enough because of your own resentment and entitlement. You think he has to like people and you are trying to force it against his will. All this is doing his causing him to resent you and will eventually cut you out completely\u2026.

You chose your BF. they didn\u2019t.  You can\u2019t expect them to love someone just because he is in YOUR life. \nRather let them go to thanksgiving as they wish and encourage the relationship between your BF and your kids to grow in an organic way. Remember that he is the adult and it is on him and you to make it work and not the kids. Forcing them to stay is just going to make them resent you both.  \nI wish you luck but forcing children in situations like this just makes it worse. \ntake into account what they want because it\u2019s their thanksgiving too - give them something that they will feel thankful for no matter how much you may not like it.", "YTA. You\u2019re being incredibly selfish and petty. Just let the kids spend half the day with you and the other half with their dad.

Let me tell what\u2019s going to happen if you keep this up: one day very soon, your kids will be old enough to choose where they want to spend the holidays and you will lose every time because you didn\u2019t care what they wanted when they were kids.

Because honestly, not only is he going to be bored, but you\u2019re going to be busy and distracted, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll actually be spending much time with him.
