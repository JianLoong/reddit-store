This year it is my holiday.  My boyfriend and I had planned to have thanksgiving with his family and friends this year and they are coming to our house. I would like my sons (14 and 7) to spend the holiday with them and their little sister.\n\nHowever my ex's sister and brother have kids (their cousins) that they are close to.  The kids are bugging me to let them go over to their house after they spend some time with me so they can go to their thanksgiving because \"my boyfriend's family is boring and weird\"?? Which I find incredibly disrespectful.  My boyfriend has been in their lives for 2 years now and we just moved in with him this year.  My teen in particular has been refusing to bond with my boyfriend, told me he \"looks like Jeffrey Dahmer\" and \"his family is weird and a bunch of rednecks\".  My 7 year old told me that my boyfriend's friends are also weird and ask him weird questions like \"why does he have both a tablet and a nintendo switch\".  My 7 year old is fine with my boyfriend though and my bf is involved with the kids and watches them and takes them to school for me when I work.  I am mostly upset with my teen as he is being unfair to my bf who has been trying hard to talk to him.  Meanwhile they love the shit out of my ex's girlfriend so it's obviously not an issue of not liking significant others of their parents.\n\nAnyway Thanksgiving is a time for family in my mind, and they spent last year's Thanksgiving with their dad's family and cousins.  I told them no, they cannot go and they are to spend the entire day with me and my boyfriend.  Now my older son is throwing a fit and saying he is just going to go to his room and not come out.

Secondly, prioritizing your bf family versus their actual cousins. And if nobody else tells you, I will- trying to force your teen to have a relationship with your bf will not work. the more you push, the more they will withdraw from it. The most you can demand is civility and respect- to the degree that it is also given to them. Punishing him or calling him disrespectful for telling you how he feels about BF family is also a no-no. He feels how he feels. So, now all you've done is tell him not to be honest with you. So, you will be greatly surprised when the whole thing blows up in your face and you had no clue.", "YTA, coparenting is difficult no doubt, but leading with what's best for the child is always best.

Go to BFs for part of the day and go see cousins and family part of the day. \n\nUnless there\u2019s great distance between making it unrealistic, I think you should be more flexible on this.\n\nI (44F) am a step mom and I met the girls when they were 10/11.

Yes, it's rightfully your holiday. And your son isn't asking to spend NO time with you. He's just wanting to also spend sometime with his other side of the fam. He's also told you that if he is forced to spend all day with you guys that he'll just be a recluse  in his room anyway. Why force him and make him miserable just so you can say hey my kid was here with all of us even though he clearly hated it and didn't interact? \n\nMaybe though look into how your 14 year old is and how your BF family/friends are.

If Thanksgiving is indeed a time for family, you should not make your children spend time with people they don't care to spend time with and who are not family. Just because you want your 14-year-old to bond with your boyfriend, it is not going to happen, especially when you try to force the matter. I feel that especially a teenager should have some say in where they spend holidays and who they spend it with. If they don't get that say, it will come back and bite you in a certain part of your body at a later (not much later) date.", "YTA- I am tired of seeing parents dating new people and trying to force their kids to have a relationship with their new partners.   No child or person should ever be forced to have a relationship with anyone.  Just because you love your BF doesn\u2019t mean everyone else has to.  Your son offered a compromise but that wasn\u2019t good enough because of your own resentment and entitlement. You think he has to like people and you are trying to force it against his will.

You chose your BF. they didn\u2019t.  You can\u2019t expect them to love someone just because he is in YOUR life. \nRather let them go to thanksgiving as they wish and encourage the relationship between your BF and your kids to grow in an organic way. Remember that he is the adult and it is on him and you to make it work and not the kids. Forcing them to stay is just going to make them resent you both.  \nI wish you luck but forcing children in situations like this just makes it worse. \ntake into account what they want because it\u2019s their thanksgiving too - give them something that they will feel thankful for no matter how much you may not like it.", "YTA. You\u2019re being incredibly selfish and petty. Just let the kids spend half the day with you and the other half with their dad.

Let me tell what\u2019s going to happen if you keep this up: one day very soon, your kids will be old enough to choose where they want to spend the holidays and you will lose every time because you didn\u2019t care what they wanted when they were kids.

The one you took, which is simply going to alienate your teen and he\u2019s going to stop coming for your court ordered holidays because he feels like you don\u2019t care about him or his comfort. \n\nThe other (and this is actually a thing you can do right now to try and reduce the harm to your relationship) would be to sit down with him and say something like, \u201cI\u2019d really preferred that you stayed and didn\u2019t the day with us because I miss you and love getting to spend time with you, but I understand that at 14 an entire day with two little kids and a bunch of adults would suck. \n\nI\u2019m willing to let you go spend pay off the day with your cousins if it\u2019s that important to you. What I ask is that you stay here with us until start the meal, and that while you are here you hang out and chat with me (because I miss seeing you and hearing about your life) and it guests. When dinner is over I\u2019ll take you to your cousins if aunt and uncle ok it.\n\nMaybe you and I can do something just the two of us that night/next morning before you go back to your dads.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s 14. It\u2019s ok to tell him that you miss him, that you want to spend time with him (without putting the weight of your feelings on him or trying to guilt him) and really, it\u2019s ideal for you to work in compromises. Because honestly, not only is he going to be bored, but you\u2019re going to be busy and distracted, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll actually be spending much time with him. It makes way more sense to be generous, improve your relationship, and then plan to spend some time with just him.", "Your sons should not know how much you hate her. The more you reply the more YTA comes out.", "One of mine told the other that he looked like Lord Fahrquad.", "He\u2019s not a stepdad. I feel like everyone is glossing over the fact that this is a boyfriend - a not super long term boyfriend at that and one who is a fair amount younger than OP.  She might think he\u2019s her kids\u2019 parents but this teen is saying loud and clear that he isn\u2019t.  Kids don\u2019t need to act like every boyfriend is their new dad - that\u2019s not fair or okay to do to them.  \n\nI know you were more objecting to me laughing about the Dahmer thing and I think it\u2019s a combo of this kid saying in his own way that he finds this new guy weird/not his dad/his family not this kid\u2019s family - and an example of OP trying to demand paternal respect for him.  \n\nAnd also, I have 14 and 16 year old boys and they are savage in their humor, but legit nice and respectful people - it\u2019s not mutually exclusive.  One of them got a bad haircut this week and I\u2019m telling you, the commentary back and forth is scathing (but hysterical), it\u2019s just how these kids talk and it\u2019s not a huge hill to die on (imo).", "No wonder why they don't want to go that sounds boring", "Then it's a no-brainer that your kids wouldn't want to be there, they have no peers to be with. Be honest, how much time are you actually going to spend with either of your sons the day of Thanksgiving when you're tending to all of your guests?", "So why would a teenager want to be there?", "Would you want to spend time with someone that doesn\u2019t respect you?", "Maybe because \"that lady\" listens to his wants and needs", "There is a reason your son wants that. Pay attention.", "My parents divorced when I was 13.  My mom made sure to NEVER say anything bad about my father, at least not in front of me.  My father was the exact opposite.  He made his feelings known, even if he thought he was being subtle about it.  He wasn't subtle at all.  When the divorce was finalized, the judge allowed me to decide who to live with.  I chose my mom because I saw the kind of person that my father was, with his little jabs about my mom that he thought I didn't notice.  Later that year, I cut him out of my life completely.  I'm now 33 years old, and I have not seen or spoken to my father since that phone call when I cut him off.  Read all of this over and over.  My father's life is your future if you continue down this path.", "It DOES really suck.  But you're saying that like you bear no fault or responsibility in creating that dynamic.\n\nIf you want to see your sons more, and have a better relationship with them, you're going to have to WORK on it.  You're going to have to find out WHY he would rather spend time with his dad and his dad's family.  You're going to have to LISTEN to him (and, in fact, listen \\*beyond\\* the snarky teenage-ness to hear what's really going on underneath).\n\nBut you know the way you're NOT going to fix things or make it so that your sons want to spend more time with you?  Disregarding their feelings, and making them do stuff with you that they don't like.\n\nSo how do you see this going down? Because it sounds a lot like your house is going to be crawling with people, you will be focused on your guests and have almost no time for your own kids; and your sons will be having a bad time, bored out of their minds, and sitting there sullenly.\n\nYeah.  That sure does sound like real quality time that's worth alienating them over!", "Well, I have to say if I was your sister I wouldn\u2019t speak to you either after this. But I also think this maybe speaks to why your son doesn\u2019t want to spend thanksgiving with you. Did you ever think you\u2019re not giving him enough attention, especially considering you have a new bf and baby?", "probably right.  She needs to think about the kids.", "Agree.  Rampant jealousy.  OP is YTA.", "He already did unfortunately which is why I wanted to spend max time with him during thanksgiving.", "Hahah that shit's funny! Made me giggle and got an instant mental picture of farquuad", "Oh don't get me wrong I'm aware of how I behaved at that age and my own humour is incredibly dark at times. I'm also honest enough to know when I was being a little shit though haha . Whether he's the boyfriend or stepdad is irrelevant to what I was objecting to , it's fine if he finds that funny and in a vacuum I also find it funny . However in the context of this being a family with adults who are trying to make a stressful situation work it's not light-hearted joshing, he doesn't like him and he's expressing it in an insulting way disguising it as humour . You wouldn't call their family 'hicks' if you liked them . \n\nHe's being honest that's the thing he genuinely doesn't connect or like these people , still doing it in a disrespectful way though .", "All OP cares about is bringing to life her perfect family holiday ideal and forcing her kid to bond with her bf. It\u2019s ridiculous.", "Because his mom and sister are there.", "You do realize that if you keep trying to force a relationship between your bf and son, your son might quit talking to you altogether. Read around the sub; so many people here are no contact with their toxic parents. He's already decided to live with his dad, and that is likely due to things like you forcing the relationship and not allowing him to visit his own family in favor of your BF's family. Lighten up on your kids before they cut you off entirely.", "All you are doing is guaranteeing is that when he is not *legally forced to spend time with you* he will never speak to you again.", "Oh yeah, every teenage boy LOVES spending time with little girls and their mother\n\nFrankly, given the way you handle this, I\u2019m guessing him not wanting to be around you isn\u2019t just teen angst", "While YOU are busy hosting, and not really able to pay much attention to him? And it sounds like his sister is little.\n\nA huge Thanksgiving gathering is not \"bonding time\" for you, your BF, and your kid. It's a big party and you and your BF are distracted with ALL of your guests.  \n\nStop fooling yourself about this.  At least TRY to put yourself in your son's shoes.\n\nAlso -- you should really be displaying more concern in both of your kids finding your BF's family \"weird\" -- like your 7 year old saying they ask invasive questions.  Are you advocating for YOUR kids at all?  Or are you just telling them to suck it up and these are people they have to put up with?\n\nYou''ll have them there for the dinner. But unless you get REALLY specific about what you expect to be doing after dinner and how it is that it is going to give you valuable \"Thanksgiving time\" with your boys specifically, then what you are holding onto is an idea, and not the idea of \"spending Thanksgiving with them\".", "I don't force my boyfriend on him.  Before we moved in together my son would always refuse to go into his house or eat with us and I never made him.  I don't even force them to do anything together, my boyfriend just tries to talk to him esp on the way to school, etc. and asks him questions about himself. My bf is usually at work anyway when I am not working.\n\nMy son decided to go with his dad because he doesn't like bf's house and thinks it's too small and hates sharing a room with his brother and thinks the area we live in is \"ghetto\".", "I see your comments around here about how much you hate your ex's gf and how bitter you are about your kids liking her. Do you say derogatory things about her to your kids? I kind of wonder if they started liking her *because* of how much you hate her. At any rate, good luck with everything!", "You forced your boyfriend on him by forcing them to live in the same house. Before you moved in did you have a bigger space where they didn\u2019t have to share a room? Now he has a smaller place, with more people, sharing a room with a child and dislikes the \u201cman of the house\u201d.", "YTA!!! I can see why your oldest son doesn\u2019t want to be around you!!!", "Why would they like someone because their mom hated them?\n\nI don't say anything about her anymore, but we call her \"that lady\" at my house because I don't like to hear my kids talking about her. My kids don't have an issue with it.", "This is life though, I couldn't afford a larger house on my own. My boyfriend owns his house and did not want to move, and we have to live together for the baby.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did not even have a bigger space before, I lived in a 2 bedroom trailer but his younger brother slept with me and he had his own room. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel at a disadvantage because my bf's ex is well off and they can afford a large 3 bedroom house where everyone has their own rooms."]}
