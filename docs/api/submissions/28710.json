To give you some context, my partner has been grappling with severe travel anxiety, which includes not just flying but also driving, and it's been an ongoing challenge for them.\n\nNow, here's the story of the trip that was supposed to happen today. In the days leading up to our travel plans, my partner's anxiety started to manifest in various ways, including suggesting alternative travel options like taking a train or an 18+ hour drive. This anxiety-driven decision-making process had been going on for days, and it was truly exhausting for both of us.\n\nFeeling drained and frustrated, I eventually suggested canceling the trip if that's what they wanted because I couldn't handle the constant stress anymore. Last night, they made the decision to cancel, and it left me deeply disappointed.\n\nNow, here's where it gets complicated. When I expressed my disappointment and frustration, my partner made me feel like I'm punishing them for their decision to cancel. They believe my expression of frustration now feels like a form of punishment.\n\nTo add to the mix, when I asked my partner why this issue wasn't a problem in their previous relationship, they pointed out that I wasn't being as supportive as their previous partner. Which was extremely hurtful because I have been trying as hard as I can to be understanding and supportive. \n\nFor example, I had a birthday trip last month that I planned as a road trip instead of flying, specifically to accommodate their travel anxiety. I also took on most of the driving responsibilities during our vacations without complaint, considering my partner\u2019s issues with driving.\n\nTraveling is basically my favorite hobby, but each trip with my partner starts inducing anxiety because I know what a nightmare it\u2019s going to be in the days leading up to it, and it completely ruins the trip for me.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that I booked this trip specifically for an event that I try to attend annually. I lost almost $1,000 between tickets and the hotels. Money isn\u2019t everything, but I would be lying if I said it doesn\u2019t sting. \n\nThis entire situation has me bummed out.

You live to travel, he physically can\u2019t\u2026 how did you even meet?", "ESH. Traveling is your hobby and your partner hates to travel? You two aren\u2019t compatible why would you get together in the first place?", "NTA, I'd start to think of some fun trips you can take away solo or with friends! I know it's lovely to experience travel with a partner, but some folk just aren't the right ones to be travelling with, and you deserve to do the thing you enjoy.", "This relationship isn't going to last very long. You want to travel. Your partner literally cannot. Just rip the bandaid off.", "If your favorite past time is traveling, how is the going to work? I have a friend who takes vacations by herself.\n\nI love that he let you make plans and get excited. Then, he tried to make you jump through ridiculous hoops they had no intention of following through on, to only then cancel.\n\nTo top it off, you are an asshole for expression a valid emotion and you're out $1,000.\n\nIf I were you I would ask him to reimburse me for the money because they were coy and didn't just admit they weren't going.\n\nPut his argument back on to him. Ask him, out of sheer curiosity, what his other partners did that was more supportive and how you are not.", "I\u2019m similar to your partner. I stopped flying for years and I don\u2019t drive on the highway. I\u2019m sure it was very difficult for my ex (especially after a 21 hour train ride to Florida!). \n\nNTA bc you\u2019re doing what you can to be accommodating. But even as someone in the same situation as your partner - I think they\u2019re the A. If they want to cancel, then you should be allowed to travel on your own (especially if it\u2019s a yearly trip that you look forward to). Additionally - they need to go to therapy to get over it. It\u2019s taken me several years of therapy and I\u2019ll finally get on a plane (with lots of meds!). Traveling is a priority for me so I\u2019m doing what I can to make it happen. It doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s a priority for your partner.", "I used to love to travel but now my anxiety makes it really difficult. However, I would make a real effort for my partner to do it. There are a lot of coping me that your partner could use (and some medication) to help. Even if I felt I couldn\u2019t go, I would fully support my partner (and encourage them) to go. Your party is actually being selfish. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re a good fit.", ">Traveling is basically my favorite hobby, but each trip with my partner starts inducing anxiety because I know what a nightmare it\u2019s going to be in the days leading up to it, and it completely ruins the trip for me.\n\nYou are not compatible as a couple.\n\nYTA for not realizing this.", "So what she said is loosely translating-- she doesn't trust you to make a plan or *your* plan without she aware what's in it.  Not cool of her. \n\nIt made me wondering-- how did she deal with her old school trips, family trips, friend trips, etc?  WTF?  Either she doesn't trust you or she fucks her mind.\n\nShe should see a therapy.   NTA\n\nMy advice? Dump her.  She has to go back to old school and learn how to tie her shoes before walking herself again.", "NTA. I was having major travel anxiety before .y vacation trip as I had never gone on a vacation before. I just went and the anxiety disappeared while I was on my trip. \n\nNext time, just go with someone else.", "Can u get with a partner that shares similar interests?

I don\u2019t like how they are so dismissive of your feeling and blaming you.\n\nI dated someone similar. I ended it because I was constantly wrong and \u2018not doing enough\u2019. When in reality, the guy I was dating wasn\u2019t doing anything for me apart from stressing me out. On a daily basis. Every task was hard to do. I asked my mom what to do and she said you need a partner in life, not a project. \n\nThey can dump all their problems on you and disrupt your plans but can\u2019t take it when you say you are not happy? NTA", "NTA. You don't have a partner. You have a millstone dragging you down, then blaming you for being frustrated.  \n\nOther than complaining, blaming, and forcing you to cater to them at every turn, what is your so-called partner doing to address *their* issue?", "NTA - but you are with the wrong partner.\nMy father hates travel and my mom loves it.\nShe didn\u2019t get to travel until I was in my 30s and she would come with me.", "NTA. My long term partner and I were the same. I love to travel, travel made them anxious and they never wanted to help plan the trip. We split up after more than a decade for this among many other issues with long term incompatibility.", "NTA. But I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re with someone who has travel anxiety when traveling is your favourite hobby. Just sounds like a recipe for frustration.", "Avoiding doing things because they make you anxious is a symptom of untreated, unmanaged anxiety. Particularly if they agreed to the trip in the first place, and then made you change at the last minute. \n\nYes, you had to change plans because of them, because they are not managing their own treatment in a way that doesn't directly impact you, over and over and over again. If the anxiety is that bad, then partner should have declined to travel, and then HAPPILY allowed OP to travel without them. If it got bad at the last minute, they should have sought help, rather than dumping it on OP, and/or offered to pay for the costs, or just cancelled for themselves and then COMMITTED TO GETTING HELP ON THIS ISSUE SO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. \n\nNTA, but I would seriously reconsider this relationship, as your partner is dumping a lot of the blame for their problems on you, then gaslighting you by saying you aren't supportive when their unmanaged anxiety directly burdens you and you (surprise) aren't happy about that.", "I developed travel anxiety over the past few years and asked my doctor who prescribed medication. Honestly just having the medication with me helps, I have seldom actually needed to take it. See if your partner is open to medication to ease the anxiety around flying. \n\nNTA.", "Why can\u2019t you travel alone", "NTA but serious question, why did you try to take them in the first place and why didn't you go alone?", "NTA.  Break up with them.", "NTA. They aren't being reasonable here or caring about your happiness. It's all about them. Are they seeking therapy for their anxiety?", "YTA if you think you are compatible. Either travel by yourself, stop traveling or both if you find new partners who are travel\nCompatible.", "NTA. Maybe next time just go on the trip yourself and leave your \u201cpartner\u201d to stew in their irrational anxiety?", "NTA but you need to stop planning trips with them in mind. They act like this every single trip and ruin it for you so finally learn your lesson and start going by yourself or with friends/family. If your partner takes issue with that let them know you\u2019ll be happy to start including them again once they start working with a professional to overcome their anxiety, and drop them from any future trips IMMEDIATELY if the old behavior starts coming back in the days leading up to the trip", "Tell this person you will be traveling alone from now on. Then do it.", "NTA but unfortunately I don\u2019t think you\u2019re compatible partners.", "NTA. You have as much right to express your frustration as your partner their anxiety.  But, at the same time, instead of just being hurt by the comment about lack of support, it could possibly be a reason - perhaps travelling with you is anxiety-inducing.", "Nobody in this situation is an a-hole. A partner who loves to travel and a partner with this much travel anxiety does not seem compatible", "NAH.\n\nBut your lifestyles are not compatible if you love to travel and your partner has crippling anxiety.\n\nEither you two need to agree that you can and should plan to take trips solo or with friends, OR your partner needs to seek therapy/coping mechanisms to find a middle ground that makes them feel comfortable and does not lead to last minute cancellations.", "End the relationship. If you love to travel, you need to be with someone who loves to travel.", "NTA. Leeaaaaave", "YTA on yourself for cancelling and continuing this relationship. You\u2019re not compatible and this person isn\u2019t going to change.", "ESH because communication isn't actually happening. \n\nYou offered to cancel. They heard you offer to cancel and everyone would be fine. You meant, cancelling will be highly frustrating but less frustrating than continuing to argue.\n\nYou need to start from scratch. Talk about what's important to each of you and whether it's possible to actually be together.", ">Traveling is basically my favorite hobby, but each trip with my partner starts inducing anxiety because I know what a nightmare it\u2019s going to be in the days leading up to it, and it completely ruins the trip for me.\n\nAgreed. You're just not compatible, you have different priorities and it sounds like it's already starting to brew resentment. \n\nI'm similar to you, I travel as much as I can and it's something I'm focusing on for my future, and this would be a dealbreaker.", "100% agree with this. \n\nI suffer from severe anxiety and I don't like to travel. It's BEYOND stressful. \n\nI would never be in a relationship with someone who LOVES to travel with their partner. Either we would travel together and I'd be a raging ball of anxiety. Or we wouldn't travel and my partner would resent me for it. \n\nBottom line, not a good combination for a lasting relationship.", "This! I used to be with someone who didn't travel. After we split he would make comments to my kids about me taking them on travels and it being a waste of money. Now that I've figured out how much I love it, I can't image even being with someone who wouldn't travel.", "This. I cannot imagine being so selfish that I would prevent my partner from doing something they enjoy just bc I suddenly change my mind, even if for valid reasons. \n\nNevermind not immediately compensating them, which I hope your partner has at least offered.", "OP, I wanted to add this here so it gets seen. Ever since I saw something traumatic, I've been dealing with anxiety. I see a therapist every week, and I get other help. My anxiety gets worse when I travel, but I've worked with my psychiatrist to get meds to make that easier. I've never not gone on a trip due to my anxiety. I just work REALLY hard to handle it well.\n\nMy point is, I understand where your partner is coming from, but she shouldn't blame this on you, and she should be doing something to improve the situation. It actually just sounds like she's doing worse than she was before and is blaming you for it.\n\nYou guys need to have a serious conversation, and then, MAYBE, discuss compromises. For example, my anxiety builds leading up to the day we travel. If we could do last minute trips, I think it would help me so much. (We can't with the kids, but maybe you guys can.) And medication, meditation, breathing techniques, etc., can do wonders, even if it's not a magic wand.", "Totally. I have anxiety and at one point I fell into a DARK place with it where I became increasingly afraid to go anywhere and basically never left the apartment unless I had to. It was miserable for me but also for my bf. I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere but then when he went out I\u2019d be panicked home alone and beg him to come back. It kept getting worse for about six months before I realized we couldn\u2019t live like that anymore and I needed to get help. If OP\u2019s partner won\u2019t recognize how their anxiety affects OP and take steps to stop it from limiting OP\u2019s life, they\u2019re not being a real partner.", "OP needs to read this and truly understand this as facts.", "They are not compatible in an area that is important to OP. This will eventually end this relationship. NTA.", "Absolutely! You\u2019re allowed to be mad, frustrated and upset that the trip had to be cancelled because of them.", "Damn okay I am getting off this sub\nYou guys are all a bunch of selfish assholes who expect people to be perfect. Especially this kind of comment, jesus. \n\nAnxiety is not someones fault. This is a horrible place.", "What did the partner say? They have since deleted all of their comments.", "Do we know the partner is a she?", "My partner and now our child has extreme, severe travel anxiety.  I cannot tell you how many trips have been cancelled, and also the stress I am under when we do make it on a trip.  \\*\\*They weren\u2019t always this way.\\*\\*  And they refuse to take medication to deal with their anxiety (they have every day severe anxiety).  Unless your partner agrees to seeking help, or you want to stay within an hour of your home for the rest of your life, I think you need to look very hard at this relationship.  I\u2019ve gotten to the point in my life that I am going to do what I want.  It\u2019s still very unpleasant - lots of fights and tension prior to any trip I take, lots of angry texts while I am gone.  It\u2019s not fun.  Good luck to you.", "Exactly. Go by yourself. If your partner is too anxious to go, staying home is free.", "My abusive ex also did a 'bait and switch' on me.  Months in I was so confused at why they were trying to make me change.", "The $$ doesn't add up.  So if you were willing to pay 1400 for a flight (which sounds like you caused the flight being missed) pay your partner for what they are out.", "Do you have a therapist? Did you seek them out this week? Your partner can't be your only support. It isn't fair for either person.", "There's a lot of other context that you've missed in this person's comments. Like the fact she's been changing meds for the past few weeks, didn't have meds before the flight, keeps saying that she knows she's super hard to manage with partners etc. If this commentor is right, sure OP could have communicated better, but this commentor is not innocent in this at all. At a certain point trying to figure out an accommodation for her anxiety, essentially last minute is incredibly difficult and stressful. It's entirely possibly that OP was okay with it at first, but when she actually had a minute to process it, she wasn't okay. Not to mention not having the necessary things (like medication to help travel when you know you'll be travelling in advance) is just a really stupid move. \n\nAnyway it doesn't even matter because this post is fake. Like there's no way this person posted this, then a few hours later their partner sees and jumps in the comments instead of actually discussing the issue with their partner. Then later deletes the Reddit account they used to post comments defending themselves.", "Today has been rough, thank you for the laugh.", "This is a reasonable response that I can understand. I still think if both sides could have communicated much better, why was the response by this sub what it was. I don't understand the vitriol shown in this thread for OPs partner, and I certainly dont understand getting voted down so much for saying \"tell me why I'm wrong and I'll listen.\" Internet points be damned, but what kind of discussions does that lead to?\n\nThis place is kinda messed up. Anyway thanks for the response", "I personally still believe most, if not all of the blame should be on the partner. Assuming this trip has been made well in advance, partner should have had enough time to sort out what she needed to be okay (like the meds). I'm also doubtful of the whole had been trying new meds for a few weeks before travelling since most medications take a minimum of 3-4 weeks to actually kick in (as a side note she didn't get her \"usual\" meds for the plane trip which seems to contradict the whole trying new meds thing). Plus she has been able to travel with partners before without issue and was trying to adjust these plans last minute. That's what tips me over onto OP's side in this made-up situation. \n\nBut yeah, downvoting someone for genuinely being open to a discussion that may end up changing their view is kind of stupid."]}
