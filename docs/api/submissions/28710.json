To give you some context, my partner has been grappling with severe travel anxiety, which includes not just flying but also driving, and it's been an ongoing challenge for them.\n\nNow, here's the story of the trip that was supposed to happen today. In the days leading up to our travel plans, my partner's anxiety started to manifest in various ways, including suggesting alternative travel options like taking a train or an 18+ hour drive. This anxiety-driven decision-making process had been going on for days, and it was truly exhausting for both of us.\n\nFeeling drained and frustrated, I eventually suggested canceling the trip if that's what they wanted because I couldn't handle the constant stress anymore. Last night, they made the decision to cancel, and it left me deeply disappointed.\n\nNow, here's where it gets complicated. When I expressed my disappointment and frustration, my partner made me feel like I'm punishing them for their decision to cancel. They believe my expression of frustration now feels like a form of punishment.\n\nTo add to the mix, when I asked my partner why this issue wasn't a problem in their previous relationship, they pointed out that I wasn't being as supportive as their previous partner. Which was extremely hurtful because I have been trying as hard as I can to be understanding and supportive. \n\nFor example, I had a birthday trip last month that I planned as a road trip instead of flying, specifically to accommodate their travel anxiety. I also took on most of the driving responsibilities during our vacations without complaint, considering my partner\u2019s issues with driving.\n\nTraveling is basically my favorite hobby, but each trip with my partner starts inducing anxiety because I know what a nightmare it\u2019s going to be in the days leading up to it, and it completely ruins the trip for me.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that I booked this trip specifically for an event that I try to attend annually. I lost almost $1,000 between tickets and the hotels. Money isn\u2019t everything, but I would be lying if I said it doesn\u2019t sting. \n\nThis entire situation has me bummed out.

I know there are barriers, sometimes financial, systematic or emotional, but these are not issues that go away by themselves. It's not easy. Treatment for my PTSD was one of the hardest things I've ever done, and while it's now managed, it's never going to be cured. But there's a lot that can be done to improve your quality of life.\n\nYou can't fix this. I know in a world full of solutions this hurts, but you can't.

But no apologies will turn back time or help her deal with her feelings better or faster.\n\nThe best thing you can do, for yourself and for your relationships in general, is to work on your anxieties. This is not a short term fix, this is a long term goal. Maybe seeing you take responsibility for your anxiety, and take visible steps to work on it, might make your partner feel better.
