I am on the spectrum but very mildly, so most people just assume I'm a little weird at most.\n\nI have four classes a day and, like my last post, share two with this bully. We can call him Dom (for anyone from my last, he is a friend of Carson). We were friends for the past two years, having classes together and generally being civil. For whatever reason, he has turned to hate me this year.\n\nFor example, I would try to make conversation with him and he would respond \"I'm not talking to you\". After some time of this, I took the hint and stopped talking to him. He started making negative comments toward me. I got into college and, when I told my friends in class, he responded \"no one cares, no one is going to be proud of you\". He'd frequently insult my intelligence, tell me no one loves me, that I shouldn't love myself, etc.\n\nOn several occasions, I've asked him what his issue is, if I've done something to wrong him, and why he's had such a change in attitude towards me, but he's never given me any explanation. It is especially confusing because, generally speaking, he is a very kind person. Dominique is the type of person who is friends with everybody, constantly laughing and joking, and it seems I am the only exception to this personality he presents, despite him having no explanation or justification on any occasion I've attempted to maturely discuss this with him.\n\nOn a particular day a few months ago, he told me that I had no right to love myself and that the only reason I do is that nobody else will. I snapped and told him in a matter of words that his parents had utterly failed him because a core part of polite society is to treat the people around you with a basic level of respect and kindness. I told him he was incredibly unlikeable, and, even if I was the only one that saw it, he was a garbage human and it will catch up to him. His friends all took his side. Whether they truly had not noticed any unkind behavior or were attempting to gaslight me I am not sure, but they all said that Dom is nothing but kind and likable and that what I was saying to him was completely baseless. Basically, I was making it all up. I know I was not because, since then, Dom has completely stopped with the comments, but stares at me with deep hatred.\n\nI have since found out that his parents split and neither care for him very much. Basically, what I said happened to be true and his parents literally did fail to teach him how to be a kind and polite member of society, which explains his general disposition towards me. Nevertheless, the fiction that I made it all up continues and he and his pals are clearly holding a grudge. I feel I was just giving him a reality check, and due to him leaving me alone, a successful one, but he and his friends clearly maintain that I was wrong in some way. So, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLots of downvotes, and not a lot of explanation. Im genuinely looking for feedback and, would appreciate some explanation if you believe I've been wrong.

You even tried to figure out the reason he was picking on you. It\u2019s not like you went from 0-100. He deserved it. The reality check he needed. Good luck with everything in life.

(Or has the friend group changed?)\n5) do you know if he got into college (if he was planning to go)?\n\nI don\u2019t think YTA, but I\u2019m trying to see if ESH or NTA. Regardless, no one has the right to be a bully like that to you. Also, congrats on getting into college. I don\u2019t know you but I\u2019m proud of, so I\u2019m sure others are too", "NTA! You have a right to defend yourself from his continuous attacks. You didn\u2019t know you were hitting a sore spot, and you weren\u2019t really insulting him either.

Thank you", "it was so frustrating bc i tried to do the right thing and talk abt it civilly so many times. thank you", "1. His parents split a long time ago, and have been as long as ive known him. \n\n2. He was doing it all the time, alone, with friends, and even in front of a teacher.\n\n3. I told him everything in front of all of his friends. A crowd of 6 who had witnessed the comments on several occasions.\n\n4. Hes only like this with me, and generally speaking is a very kind, regular person\n\n5. He is going to the local community college.", "also, thank you so much. it is a large accomplishment for me and Im very excited. I never thought for a second that his claim was true and have many great people in my life who more than counteract this one negative little roach. Its very admirable of you to say this, thank you.", "im incredibly vengeful towards this person, but have not acted or retaliated in any way up to this point. its been entirely one sided, so i assure you it is bullying and everything ive shared is 100% accurate", "im happy to clear up any suspicions, what parts of my story have come into question?", "I understand that. I didn't know when I said it and just assume through the benefit of the doubt that everyone that doesn't practice a basic level of kindness was failed in some way and were not born like that. If I'd known the details, I would have chosen my words more carefully, but I did not and that is where the AITA question is coming from.", "You're going to be great! You are clearly clever and have alot of compassion so you'll zoom through the rest of the year xx", "Then definitely NTA. \n\nI thought maybe he was acting this way out of jealousy or maybe you hit him when he was down, but none of that seems applicable. Good for you for standing up for yourself. \n\nAlso, ignore his friends. You do you", "thank you sm i appreciate it", "Thank you. The hatred is palpable but him knowing not to try me has made my day to day so much better. Very kind thank you", "Do you think your bully might have a crush on you?

Savor your victory. He deserved that.", "NTA of course. What you said was spot on. And he is not a nice person. Sometimes people act nice, but aren't. \n\nNot sure why he chose you to be his target, but he definitely is projecting his own hate onto you Imo. \nHis friends have maybe never realized his comments (did he only insult you when you two were alone?) or they turn a blind eye to it. Either way NTA and good you stand up for yourself. \n\nMaybe look for friends outside of the classes. Do you have specific hobbies? That can help. Doesn't matter if it's sport, gaming or gardening. It's a good way to socialize.", "NTA", "NTA at all. Dom is projecting his issues onto you. One of the best ways you can overcome people who hurt you is to live your best life. It sounds like you\u2019re doing that. Self-love is so incredibly important, and something a lot of people don\u2019t have - Especially Dom. But you\u2019re not his therapist or his punching bag. He can figure his own stuff out.\n\nLive your best life, and I wish you nothing but luck :)", "always makes a comeback better when it turns out to be true", "INFO: Considering his comments and family situation, is it possible he's jealous of you?\n\nHave you gotten better grades, been accepted into a better college or had teachers offer you more support/praise than him?\n\nDo you have family that by their actions, make it obvious they love you? eg gifts or cheering you on at events etc (Something he could compare to his own family and find them lacking.)\n\n(You don't have to answer this one) but are you gay and accepted by those around you? (I only ask because it might explain his comments and why he's targeting you if he is in the closet and scared of peoples reactions if he comes out.)\n\nNo matter what your answers are, you're still NTA, but it may give you some idea of what his problem is.", "I mean honestly, it wouldn't matter if his parents were splitting up at the same time as he started mocking him. Just because he was down, does not give him the right to kick OP like that, and he definitely deserved a healthy dose of face smacking reality no matter what his situation was. Just because you are hurt, does not mean you get to hurt other people. Just because you are hurt, does not mean you get to skirt the consequences of the things you do and say. So if you're being a crappy person, you deserve That healthy dose of reality.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTbh he might just like you, some guys are like that"]}
