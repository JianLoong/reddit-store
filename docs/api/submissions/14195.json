I am on the spectrum but very mildly, so most people just assume I'm a little weird at most.\n\nI have four classes a day and, like my last post, share two with this bully. We can call him Dom (for anyone from my last, he is a friend of Carson). We were friends for the past two years, having classes together and generally being civil. For whatever reason, he has turned to hate me this year.\n\nFor example, I would try to make conversation with him and he would respond \"I'm not talking to you\". After some time of this, I took the hint and stopped talking to him. He started making negative comments toward me. I got into college and, when I told my friends in class, he responded \"no one cares, no one is going to be proud of you\". He'd frequently insult my intelligence, tell me no one loves me, that I shouldn't love myself, etc.\n\nOn several occasions, I've asked him what his issue is, if I've done something to wrong him, and why he's had such a change in attitude towards me, but he's never given me any explanation. It is especially confusing because, generally speaking, he is a very kind person. Dominique is the type of person who is friends with everybody, constantly laughing and joking, and it seems I am the only exception to this personality he presents, despite him having no explanation or justification on any occasion I've attempted to maturely discuss this with him.\n\nOn a particular day a few months ago, he told me that I had no right to love myself and that the only reason I do is that nobody else will. I snapped and told him in a matter of words that his parents had utterly failed him because a core part of polite society is to treat the people around you with a basic level of respect and kindness. I told him he was incredibly unlikeable, and, even if I was the only one that saw it, he was a garbage human and it will catch up to him. His friends all took his side. Whether they truly had not noticed any unkind behavior or were attempting to gaslight me I am not sure, but they all said that Dom is nothing but kind and likable and that what I was saying to him was completely baseless. Basically, I was making it all up. I know I was not because, since then, Dom has completely stopped with the comments, but stares at me with deep hatred.\n\nI have since found out that his parents split and neither care for him very much. Basically, what I said happened to be true and his parents literally did fail to teach him how to be a kind and polite member of society, which explains his general disposition towards me. Nevertheless, the fiction that I made it all up continues and he and his pals are clearly holding a grudge. I feel I was just giving him a reality check, and due to him leaving me alone, a successful one, but he and his friends clearly maintain that I was wrong in some way. So, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLots of downvotes, and not a lot of explanation. Im genuinely looking for feedback and, would appreciate some explanation if you believe I've been wrong.

That was the nicest thing you could have said to him", "Definitely NTA. He needed to hear the truth.", "NTA at all. You tolerated him for a long time. You even tried to figure out the reason he was picking on you. It\u2019s not like you went from 0-100. He deserved it. The reality check he needed. Good luck with everything in life.

(Or has the friend group changed?)\n5) do you know if he got into college (if he was planning to go)?\n\nI don\u2019t think YTA, but I\u2019m trying to see if ESH or NTA. Regardless, no one has the right to be a bully like that to you. Also, congrats on getting into college. I don\u2019t know you but I\u2019m proud of, so I\u2019m sure others are too", "NTA! You have a right to defend yourself from his continuous attacks. You didn\u2019t know you were hitting a sore spot, and you weren\u2019t really insulting him either. You merely pointed out an explanation for his hostile behavior.

His parents split a long time ago, and have been as long as ive known him. \n\n2. He was doing it all the time, alone, with friends, and even in front of a teacher.\n\n3. I told him everything in front of all of his friends. A crowd of 6 who had witnessed the comments on several occasions.\n\n4.

The hatred is palpable but him knowing not to try me has made my day to day so much better. Very kind thank you"]}
