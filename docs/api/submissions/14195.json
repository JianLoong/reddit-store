I am on the spectrum but very mildly, so most people just assume I'm a little weird at most.\n\nI have four classes a day and, like my last post, share two with this bully. We can call him Dom (for anyone from my last, he is a friend of Carson). We were friends for the past two years, having classes together and generally being civil. For whatever reason, he has turned to hate me this year.\n\nFor example, I would try to make conversation with him and he would respond \"I'm not talking to you\". After some time of this, I took the hint and stopped talking to him. He started making negative comments toward me. I got into college and, when I told my friends in class, he responded \"no one cares, no one is going to be proud of you\". He'd frequently insult my intelligence, tell me no one loves me, that I shouldn't love myself, etc.\n\nOn several occasions, I've asked him what his issue is, if I've done something to wrong him, and why he's had such a change in attitude towards me, but he's never given me any explanation. It is especially confusing because, generally speaking, he is a very kind person. Dominique is the type of person who is friends with everybody, constantly laughing and joking, and it seems I am the only exception to this personality he presents, despite him having no explanation or justification on any occasion I've attempted to maturely discuss this with him.\n\nOn a particular day a few months ago, he told me that I had no right to love myself and that the only reason I do is that nobody else will. I snapped and told him in a matter of words that his parents had utterly failed him because a core part of polite society is to treat the people around you with a basic level of respect and kindness. I told him he was incredibly unlikeable, and, even if I was the only one that saw it, he was a garbage human and it will catch up to him. His friends all took his side. Whether they truly had not noticed any unkind behavior or were attempting to gaslight me I am not sure, but they all said that Dom is nothing but kind and likable and that what I was saying to him was completely baseless. Basically, I was making it all up. I know I was not because, since then, Dom has completely stopped with the comments, but stares at me with deep hatred.\n\nI have since found out that his parents split and neither care for him very much. Basically, what I said happened to be true and his parents literally did fail to teach him how to be a kind and polite member of society, which explains his general disposition towards me. Nevertheless, the fiction that I made it all up continues and he and his pals are clearly holding a grudge. I feel I was just giving him a reality check, and due to him leaving me alone, a successful one, but he and his friends clearly maintain that I was wrong in some way. So, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLots of downvotes, and not a lot of explanation. Im genuinely looking for feedback and, would appreciate some explanation if you believe I've been wrong.

It's a good way to socialize.", "NTA", "NTA at all. Dom is projecting his issues onto you. One of the best ways you can overcome people who hurt you is to live your best life.

Just because he was down, does not give him the right to kick OP like that, and he definitely deserved a healthy dose of face smacking reality no matter what his situation was.

It is were someone who has been abused, finally snapping and responding back.\n\nThe abuser then uses it to turn the narrative and paint the victim as the aggressor/ instigator.\n\nI am proud of you for getting into college.  And the fact you're posting here shows that you did not want to have to say those things to him, You had enough.\n\nI have a kiddo on the spectrum.  We often go over  \"keep trying, you'll do better\" (Daniel Tiger).\n\nI really hope your words gave the bully feel for thought because he can keep trying at being a better person.  In the grand scheme of things, hating on others and trying to make them seem small to make themselves feel big.  \n\nI wondered. Do you have a good family?  Supportive parents?  I only wonder if he since he used to be your friend, if he hated what you had and he didn't. Nothing gives him the right treat you that way.\n\nAs this was occurring in a school setting, I would hope the school would have some sort of code of conduct that bullying hazing like that wouldn't be allowed.

Yes, the remarks are bad, but seem to be in response to contact initiated by OP? I get the feeling Dom isn't going out of his way to interact with OP at all.\n\nIt's clear that Dom resents OP but it also seems weird that he's OK with everyone else. Since OP says they are on the spectrum, wondering if there's some past interaction they missed. I guess this is an INFO request as I feel like something is not being accurately portrayed.", "NTA. But you should figure out what his issue was and then tell him where to stick it.", "NTA but think twice before blaming his parents\n\nI'm currently estranged from my brother due to similar behavior on his part, very painful for me to acknowledge his limitations as a person and accept this is the new baseline for our relationship. My mother is still explaining away his shitty actions, she's an enabler from way back. \n\nThing is, she raised us BOTH to be a polite & kind member of society. To speak with empathy & respect (he's never done this) and have compassion for others. \n\nIt is not my mother's fault my brother is unable to apologize or look me in the eye or acknowledge the consequences of his behavior. She did a good job raising us and it's not her fault he's broken.", "Also I believe Dom is deeply deeply jealous of you or attracted to you. \n\nIt almost sounds like you're proudly gay & out and he is angry about it and trapped in the closet, jealous of your freedom, but you don't allude to ANYTHING of such a nature whatsoever. \n\nWhich means... is there something similar Dom may envy of you? Some area of confidence you posess that they don't?\n\nBecause that whole \"you don't deserve love\" business is straight projection.", "Nta.

Truth hurts, and if he wanted to be treated with kid gloves, he should not have attacked you.", "NTA - bullies generally can't take what they dish out.", "NTA: ideally no-one should ever say anything in a temper but everyone has their limit and he had it coming, and he was the one who started with the \"nobody likes you\" line. Unfortunately a big \"oops!\" on accidentally hitting so close to home when you finally snapped.

What you said struck him to the core. If you continue to treat him with kindness and respect and speak hard truths to him, you\u2019ll be doing better for him than almost everyone else around him.", "I think the key to showing that you were raised better than he is by being polite to them and generally ignoring them if they don\u2019t engage you. If they do, then briefly try to deescalate and then feel free to clap back again if they continue. You didn\u2019t wrong him and I would literally ignore anything they say complaining about him being hurt", "I did something similar to the guy who tried to bully me and all the other \"A Track\" guys in high school.  I would just deadpan talk to him about how sorry I was that his parent's clearly didn't love him, and that it was sad he tried to find value in teasing others and trying to pick fights with them.  \n\nFor a few weeks that drew all his rage onto me, and he left everyone else alone.  \n\nThen I'd start to dig in and say things like, \"Don't take their divorce personally. They didn't get divorced because they didn't love you, they got divorced because they didn't love each other. The fact they don't love you and regret having you is totally irrelevant.\"  One day, one of those remarks worked and I baited him into physically attacking me.  He didn't know I was as strong or resilient as I was. I got in a good punch to the stomach, and knocked the wind out of him.  I took the opportunity of his recoil to pin his neck to the lockers about 6 inches off the ground for about 30 seconds before a security guard grabbed me.  \n\nThe security guard tried to get me expelled, as the bully was his son's best friend and their families vacationed together.  I told the principal their \"witness statement\" was garbage, and it was highly problematic the district would allow the parent of a student to work as a security guard in the building as there are clear conflicts of interest.  The principal didn't even know that, and he was transferred to another school.\n\nThis happened in full view of classmates and teachers, and everyone corroborated that he threw the first punch and was a known bully.  I negotiated 3 days of detention for fighting back against my attacker, which would be eliminated from my transcripts as long as I didn't get in another fight for 2 years.  He got 2 weeks of suspension.\n\nThe principal initially wanted me to have a stronger punishment, but there were so many improprieties abound as this was a known bully the school did nothing about.  I made it clear I would make it a big issue with the school board if the punishment for protecting myself against an attacker they knew to harass students was unfair.", "What  happened to the bully?", "My plans exactly! I dont know or care if he wants to bang or not Im just glad to be left alone LOL", "Our grades and interactions with teachers are similarly high. My family does love me very much and I often do have funny stories to bring to class about whatever my dad and I were up to the previous weekend or whatever else. I am not gay but i am a very flamboyant straight man due to my older brother being gay and me picking up many mannerisms growing up. None of these apply to me more than anyone else, so either he chose me at random or there is just something Im not realizing", "He largely left me and my classmates alone.\n\nA few times over the next 3+ years (this happened Freshman year of high school), he tried to revert to his old ways.\n\nOddly, whenever he tried that stuff around me, karma seemed to always follow him around and things would immediately backfire, or he would get in trouble for something completely unrelated at the time like having a knife in his locker.  It was very weird.   Just so many coincidences of him trying to bully someone, and then getting punished for something else.", "Could be how obviously close you are to your dad.\n\nHis dad might've started avoiding him around the same time he started picking on you?", "Clarifying the above: The knife was not planted. He was a Boy Scout and it was his. I believe \"someone\" who was once in Boy Scouts with him may have seen him put some gear in his school locker and knew there was a knife in there and tipped off the relevant school staff...", "Ew. No. He is just an asshole."]}
