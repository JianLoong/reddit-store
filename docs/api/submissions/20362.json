If it's REALLY that hard for you to listen for thirty minutes, you probably need to get out of the relationship and spend some time working on yourself.  \n\n\nIt just blows my mind that someone would take the time to share her job--a large part of her life that doesn't directly involve you--and your response is \"ugh, it's such a waste of my time to hear about your day!\"  Do you even like this person?", "YTA- \n\nShe may be dumping her entire day on you, but did you ever think maybe she does so as a mechanism to unload the stress from the day or let out some thoughts she couldn\u2019t otherwise tell anyone else besides you, (I assume) one of the people she trusts the most? Her job sounds like a lot and it\u2019s nice to have someone with no skin in the game to listen. \n\nI think you need to soften your view on this.

Unfortunately it is useful to them to have someone who listens but it can feel like a trap if they go on and on.\n\nShe's not the asshole either.  She wants to vent and trusts you and you've allowed this long enough that it's part of the relationship.  She wants to talk to you and this feels meaningful and therapeutic to her.\n\nHowever, I totally get what you mean about 1 way conversations and being talked at.  It feels like you're a trapped animal looking for an escape. You can see the time going by and there's just no pause. You try to chime in and really the flow just goes on as if you haven't.  If there's a pause at all it's to look at you for an expected answer to confirm your listening or to offer agreement.\n\nMaybe I'm projecting, but does that sound familiar?

So...I don't think you're wrong to be annoyed once you find you've landed yourself in that cycle.\n\nThat said,  I don't know how tactfully you told her and I get for her why it didn't feel good. Everyone needs to vent and your partner is a natural place to do it.  And something she probably feels she needs feel a partner because it's therapeutic. \n\nBut it's not at all therapeutic for you.  It's stressful.  And it sounds like you're starting to resent it and it's creating friction that's unpleasant for you both.  (\"Are you even listening to me?\")\n\nYou know what doesn't feel good? Having someone give you a boundary or enforcing it. That's what you tried to do.  Setting boundaries doesn't feel good either but sometimes you have to if it's important to you. \n\nIf you can find ways to have 2 easy conversations without feeling trapped, great.

Unless your gf doesn\u2019t allow you to engage in what she\u2019s saying.\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with this before. But I\u2019ve learned that if I\u2019m not in the right headspace to listen to my partner, I say so - \u201chey, I really want to hear that story but I\u2019m having a hard time paying attention right now. Can we pick this up a bit later once I\u2019ve had time to decompress?\u201d My issue is that I often need to kind of \u201cturn off\u201d for like an hour after I\u2019m done with work. Do something that doesn\u2019t take a lot of processing/brain power. And that\u2019s perfectly acceptable, as is someone\u2019s need to process their day by talking through it.\n\nIn addition to stating when I don\u2019t have the capacity to give the level of attention they deserve in that moment, when we do have chats about our days, it\u2019s important I\u2019m allowed to join in (and Vice versa). This isn\u2019t a linear conversation or story most of the time thanks to my ADHD, but from a listening standpoint I\u2019ve picked up a few hacks to follow along to longer stories. \n\nI have to be able to make comments, not ones that interject to take over the conversation, but more like commentary on what\u2019s happening in the story they\u2019re telling me. If something is ridiculous, I say so. If it sounds overwhelming or frustrating in any way, I say so. \n\nSince I haven\u2019t met any of my partner\u2019s coworkers, I don\u2019t have a face to go with names - I\u2019m not expected to remember every single person, though. But when names come up that are questionable, I\u2019ll chime in and ask \u201cis John Smith that guy that XYZ\u201d (used when I suspect I\u2019m thinking of the right person and have a past story detail about them for reference) or just \u201cI\u2019m sorry, which one is John Smith again?\u201d I\u2019m horrible with names, even in person, but following who is who when you\u2019ve never even had the opportunity to see their face can be hard for anyone. Doing this shows that not only have I listened and remembered past work stories, but I\u2019m actively following along to the current one.\n\nThe way you went about this isn\u2019t the most mature from a relationship communication standpoint, but please note that my saying that is very much pot calling kettle. I\u2019m not great at more serious conversations, but I also have the tendency to believe other people\u2019s response/reactions to what I have to say is my responsibility to manage. It\u2019s not! Despite that, in a relationship I think it\u2019s important to have that kind of empathy when broaching difficult discussions. Not to avoid a negative response outright, but to make the negative emotion land a little softer than a bomb that triggers automatic defense from the other person.\n\nTALK TO YOUR PARTNER. If you don\u2019t want them feeling devalued or like you don\u2019t care, tell them that.

I do listen patiently WHEN I KNOW it's important for him to get through his points, but he also accepts my comments or questions when he is not 'on a mission'. Ask her to try finding a point to pause - where you can ask her a question or make a comment. Or let her know you are going to ask her to pause at a point or two so that you can interject something into the conversation.\n6. You are letting your gf know that this pattern is not great for you. Now you ask her to collaborate with you on how you can both support each other. That's what partners SHOULD DO. You understand her need to decompress by sharing; you want to support that.

Your girlfriend is looking to vent and for some people that is really important however I do think 30 minutes of venting a day is excessive contrary to what everyone else in the comments is trying to say. To put this in perspective, I work a 9-5 Monday through Friday but to get to my office on time with an hour commute I wake up at 7 AM to start getting ready and don\u2019t get home until a little after 6 PM. At this point I now want to work out for at least 45 minutes, walk my dog and make myself dinner. Sometimes my girlfriend makes dinner so I don\u2019t have to but she sometimes works late so if I do have to do all of these things I typically don\u2019t start decompressing until closer to 8 PM if I\u2019m lucky. Adding on a half an hour everyday to listen to my girlfriend vent about work would be a lot considering then I\u2019d barely have much time for myself and what I need to decompress throughout the week when I also work a stressful job and don\u2019t need more emotional weight added on every day.\n\nAt the same time I do recognize that you do seem annoyed and clearly she could tell and is now afraid to share her day with you. Relationships fail due to poor communication and you should have let her know about this sooner. It sounds like you weren\u2019t harsh with what you said but she already felt like you didn\u2019t care and things sat for too long and now you both are in a situation that could have been avoided. You both need to communicate to find common ground and a solution to this problem. Her response to what you said was passive aggressive but you also weren\u2019t hiding your feelings of being annoyed so I can\u2019t say either one of you is an AH.\n\nYou\u2019re a team and need to work as a team to fight the problems surrounding you and not each other. It sounds like you both have different styles of relaxing after a hard day of work and need to come to some sort of compromise. Do something you find relaxing and do it with her so she can talk about her day. Take a walk together, make dinner together, something easy that she can talk to you during and once it\u2019s done then no more talk about work for the rest of the evening ya know? I don\u2019t know you both so I can\u2019t find the perfect solution but you both have been together for 9 years so if you both actually try to communicate I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure out something that works for each of you.", "YTA. There is an easy way to turn these monologues into conversations, and that is to actually take an interest in your gf's life and job. Ask follow-up questions! Clarify who is who in the stories! Ask her how these situations made her feel, and what she did to manage them in the moment, and make supportive noises! There might be times when you need to decompress from your work first, or if you had a really rough day you might need to occasionally (and very nicely) ask her to postpone or abbreviate the day's report, but for the most part this is a major reason why people want to have a life partner in the first place: because they want someone on their team, who is invested in their experiences and interested in their perspective.

It\u2019s normal for things to built up resentment if you don\u2019t talk about it, and that\u2019s what happened with you. She needs to hear you out for the sake of the relationship.

I figured out that a good time for him is while he's getting ready for the day, he has work on his mind and wants to talk about it so I'll sit with him while he gets dressed and listen. I typically vent in a text message when it happens, and he knows he doesn't have to read it or respond, I just need to get it out of my system at that moment and will feel calmer after I have. He can read it later if he wants or say when he gets home \"I saw you sent me a long message, what happened?\" Communication needs to work for both people in the relationship and it isn't working for you. That's okay.", "I'd honestly have to be a fly on the wall to hear how the conversations play out between you two, but I had to deal with my partner venting/ranting every single day to me about the \"dumbass\" guys he works with and it started to take a toll. It wasn't a 2-way conversation it was more him emotionally dumping on me and I eventually told him that his venting to me is always so negative and he never asks me about my day. He apologized and stopped doing that. Just tell your partner that you like hearing about her day but you also want to talk about your day as well and have it a 2-way conversation.", "YTA. I also work in a school. My partner will listen, laugh and sigh about my day with me in the evening. Usually for about 30 minutes. He will straight up ask me \"How is so-and-so?\", \"Did you get hurt today?\" \"What is your class doing tomorrow?\".", "NTA. Having someone rant everyday is exhausting. Also, 9 years, do you see this relationship moving forward to marriage or just stay as is?", "NTA. I\u2019d understand if it was every once in a while and short rants, but 30 minutes EVERY DAY is bad. Partners are not therapists, so she shouldn\u2019t be treating you like one.", "NTA. Man Reddit is ridiculous. A bloody surgeon (who imo has a way more interesting job) can't share his day with his wife because \"she's trying to decompress too\" meanwhile this guy is being talked at about his spouses day and is apparently 100% at fault. I totally sympathize with OP, people who can't tell stories properly are draining. \"It was on a Thursday 4 years ago when I....no wait it was a Tuesday, Mary was there or no, maybe it was Marty...\" OMFG. GET. TO. THE. POINT. For this to be every single day? You don't get to hold a person verbally hostage so you can digest your day. Pick three main things that happened that day, organize your thoughts to prevent digression or rambling and then engage with the person. Examples: \"You'll never guess what happened at work today, something wild happened at work today, wanna hear about it? Remember how I told you about X?\" This lets the potential listener actually be apart of the conversation. You can love your spouse AND dislike certain traits.", "NTA. There is a difference between some quick chat about her day and her using you to vent and decompress. Its totally ok for her to do it sometimes. but if she feels she needs to talk to someone about her day EVERY day for half an hour and just talk at them instead of with them. then she needs to get a therapist because that's what therapists are for. Its unfair for her to be using you to manage her mental health if thats what she is doing.", "NAH. My husband does this to me. I came home from a long day of work and got talked at for 45 minutes last night. It was mentally exhausting and all I wanted to do was decompress with the little time I had before I had to do it all again the next day.\n\nThat being said, I let him talk because I know it\u2019s his own decompression time, and he enjoys sharing his day with me. I\u2019ve had to tell him that I want conversations, not lectures, and he does work on it. Maybe either work with your wife on making it a conversation, or discuss some kind of time limit where she gets to vent but after that it\u2019s an open floor?", "Maybe they each need a set amount of time where they have the floor and talk about whatever they want to say.  15 minutes?  After which time no more work talk?", "A partner rambling on and on about work does get boring.  My partner does it all of the time.  Fortunately he seems to not mind if I'm minimally engaged during that time, maybe I'll be cleaning the kitchen or prepping dinner or something while he is rambling about his day.  I like listening to his voice, he has a radio voice, but I don't feel like I have to retain all the info.  I tease him sometimes about how I just listen to the sound of his voice without all the words.  He talks a lot and knows I am an introvert and thankfully doesn't take offense that I'm not hanging on every gripping word about his work day.  I think coming out and telling your partner you don't want to hear it was a little rude.  Rather just find a way that you can also be getting something else done.  Or ask her to save it for the right time.  Maybe after work you need an hour to relax without conversation and then you'll be ready.  Whatever works for you, do that.  You can have your boundaries of course but a compromise will be best, its pretty rough to tell your partner you don't want to hear about their day at ALL.  Listen but find a way it won't make you feel like wasted time.", "YTA\n\nYou can't spare 30 minutes...also is it not a 2 way convo because she doesn't let you speak? Or do you just stop talking and let her speak at you? Idk, I feel like this is pretty normal, and you're just getting annoyed.", "NAH. Yeah, I've lived this. It's not a conversation. It's not a 2-way thing. You are meant to sit and give attention, not participate, while you absorb it. Not a problem once or five times or ten times, but daily for weeks and months and years. \n\nThere is no good resolution. She wants to feel validated, you want to feel like you are more than a doormat. However, she feels like only your passive but focused attention is appropriate, whereas silent attention gets hard after hours of the same same same and making emphathic non-verbal responses gets hard when there's no empathy coming your way. (Try reversing the situation, she won't find it acceptable after the first few days and will somehow conclude that her venting is valid because reasons, whereas your venting is not as important to her.)\n\nBest idea I've found is to let her know that you just can't.", "Yeah sorry man yta, not like a major one but it\u2019s kind of a dick move 30 minutes isn\u2019t a long time she might feel like she can vent this stuff to anyone else so she comes to you about it.

Like you're not wrong for not being interested but i feel terrible for your GF right now. The implications of your partner finding a daily habit annoying is pretty devastating. YTA", "YTA. You basically made her very anxious to tell you anything about her day. Do you even love her?", "Since this is all for her, could you have her talk at you while you're making dinner together,  going on a walk, or doing something else productive? It's not really anything you can engage with, and it's more about her needing to decompress. Let her talk through it. She's using you like a journal.

I would be annoyed too. Sounds like she talking at you and not to you but expects you take notes and know all the details.", "NAH, I've clashed heads with my gf many times over this exact issue. She WFH and I go into the office so the moment I come through the front door I'm getting blasted with stories and drama about this coworker, that coworker, etc. etc.  \n\n\nYou need to have another conversation with her, because its not unreasonable to NOT want to hear a monologue for every issue as soon as you get home. You can only be so subtle", "YTA, you will end up single. Why not listen for a while. Then share your day.", "It blows my mind that anyone would let their so just unload all their negativity on them every day.\nCause that shit will definitly ruin my evening and I wouldnt want to be in a relationship with someone like that anyways.\n\nIf they need a 30min therapy session everyday after work, maybe they should get a different fucking job.", "Am also a teacher and can confim: most of us really really need to talk about our days. They are high stress, high demand, and can be very isolating. Burnout is high for a reason. And a resource teacher has it extra hard, because their job is often to work with the children with huge support needs or major behavioral issues. YTA.\n\nThat being said, it is also exhausting to listen to. It would be totally reasonable to, gently and lovingly, set some boundaries around her venting. Maybe a time limit, maybe asking her to keep it to a low and a high. Totally reasonable. But asking her to stop and that it annoys you is not kind.\n\nAlso also, she should maybe see a therapist. Lots of teachers need them because of burnout. But that suggestion probably should not come from you, at least not right now.", "I do think it\u2019s fair for OP to occasionally forget names but she\u2019s probably more upset about that because he seems annoyed and checked out.", "What about his mechanisms for unloading stress? They might might the opposite of hers. Why are hers more important?", "There are different ways to do it though, and it seems like her coping mechanism is placing a burden on her partner. That\u2019s not a good mechanism.\n\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to ask for it to be a higher level summary. OP has their own life with minute details to remember and manage, and expecting someone to add all of yours on top of their own isn\u2019t sustainable.", "Dude, that is absolutely not the same situation. The OP in that post said her husband was talking to her as if she was a med student, which of course would be annoying, and they have a son together whom she takes care, I understand why she would be fed up being talked as if she was at work, treated as if she was someone who needs to learn every single detail. She comes home from work to care of her son (which would be like a second job) to hear her husband keep talking about work when she just wants to relax AND after telling him a lot of times that she prefers to chill, but he keeps going. In this post, the OP never clarifies those things, but even then I would say NAH, not because I compared two situations that have nothing in common more than a couple that is just doing couple things, but just because it would be exhausting hearing the same things everyday.", "It\u2019s not faking interest it\u2019s just being there to be a sound board. \nYour partner is stressed and venting to you.

And he \u201cneeds\u201d her to give him some space?", "The amount of people making it out like you don't care, astonished me.

A lot of people are sharing about how they have engaging conversations with their partners at the end of the day but that is not what this sounds like. Sounds exhausting to get 30 minutes of talk and no space to respond?", "Agreed.

I did my therapy and inner work and stopped forcing incompatibility, et voila! I switched friend groups and I then was surrounded with people who knew how to listen too! I didn't get mad with my previous friend group but I only saw them 2x-3x a year vs before where I would see them 2x a month and I was a happier person overall. Same thing with exes. My previous ex sucked at listening but he would complain if I wasn't listening. When time came for me to vent, he would just zone out. He had a ton of selfish traits that I never noticed until months later, let's be clear, but him being a bad listener was a deal breaker for me. I broke up with his selfish ass and I did more therapy and inner work and guess what...I met my husband a year later and I never had to beg him to listen to me or be miserable because we both love each other and we both love listening to each other talk! We take turns and it could be anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes and then we both get something to eat later on! That's what I'm talking about!
