Dude, she takes half an hour every evening to verbally process her VERY STRESSFUL job.   Just listen.  If it's REALLY that hard for you to listen for thirty minutes, you probably need to get out of the relationship and spend some time working on yourself.  \n\n\nIt just blows my mind that someone would take the time to share her job--a large part of her life that doesn't directly involve you--and your response is \"ugh, it's such a waste of my time to hear about your day!\"  Do you even like this person?", "YTA- \n\nShe may be dumping her entire day on you, but did you ever think maybe she does so as a mechanism to unload the stress from the day or let out some thoughts she couldn\u2019t otherwise tell anyone else besides you, (I assume) one of the people she trusts the most? Her job sounds like a lot and it\u2019s nice to have someone with no skin in the game to listen. \n\nI think you need to soften your view on this. If you love her, listen to her long annoying drawn out stories. You might miss them one day.", "Why be in a relationship if you aren't willing to listen to the other person?  It sounds like she has a stressful job, and needed to decompress. It seems like she (felt) safd with you to let her guard down and to relax. \n\nIt's one thing to not remember every single detail..but if you visibly look pained, then it probably hurt her.", "YTA\n\nYou can easily contribute by telling her about your day in return. You could contribute by asking questions if you\u2019ve got such a hard time following.\n\nThis is clearly important to her and it\u2019s really awful of you to make her feel bad because you want her to shut up. Do you even like your girlfriend?", "NAH - I have people in my life that do this to me and it SUCKS.  Unfortunately it is useful to them to have someone who listens but it can feel like a trap if they go on and on.\n\nShe's not the asshole either.  She wants to vent and trusts you and you've allowed this long enough that it's part of the relationship.  She wants to talk to you and this feels meaningful and therapeutic to her.\n\nHowever, I totally get what you mean about 1 way conversations and being talked at.  It feels like you're a trapped animal looking for an escape. You can see the time going by and there's just no pause. You try to chime in and really the flow just goes on as if you haven't.  If there's a pause at all it's to look at you for an expected answer to confirm your listening or to offer agreement.\n\nMaybe I'm projecting, but does that sound familiar? If so I totally understand.  That's my mother and I for years. So...I don't think you're wrong to be annoyed once you find you've landed yourself in that cycle.\n\nThat said,  I don't know how tactfully you told her and I get for her why it didn't feel good. Everyone needs to vent and your partner is a natural place to do it.  And something she probably feels she needs feel a partner because it's therapeutic. \n\nBut it's not at all therapeutic for you.  It's stressful.  And it sounds like you're starting to resent it and it's creating friction that's unpleasant for you both.  (\"Are you even listening to me?\")\n\nYou know what doesn't feel good? Having someone give you a boundary or enforcing it. That's what you tried to do.  Setting boundaries doesn't feel good either but sometimes you have to if it's important to you. \n\nIf you can find ways to have 2 easy conversations without feeling trapped, great.  Or if she can find a better more healthy way to vent.  If not... good thing she's your girlfriend and not your wife because there's time to escape.", "Oh my goodness I actually feel this so hard, NTA!! \n\nMy mom does this to me, where she goes on and on and on about superfluous details of her day to day job for hours and it is actually so stressful!

What about your mental load? \n\nAnybody whose never dealt with someone like this on a regular basis is going to say you\u2019re the AH bc it\u2019s impossible to imagine the long term affects of being someone else\u2019s emotional dumping ground unless you\u2019ve actually experienced it. \n\nYour gf should try therapy if she needs someone to dump her mental load on.

So whilst we are unloading, venting getting rid of all that negativity onto them and it becomes an every day thing it can become a lot. Sometimes you need to come home from work, need to unwind and someone talking at you for 30 minutes starts to take its toll.

Half an hour is WAYYY to long to blather ok about work. Sure, she may need to decompress, but you don\u2019t have to constantly be the mechanism by which she facilitates that. She can exercise, journal, go for a walk, commiserate with a colleague, or find something else. I\u2019d tap out after five minutes of being talked at. And for those asking if you know how to engage in a conversation or ask follow up questions - why would you want to do that to extend a \u201cconversation\u201d you don\u2019t want to be in?? Obviously there would be occasional exceptions when major shit goes down, but a play-by-play on the regular is a no for me.", "NTA it is fine if she is sharing about something interesting that happens at work but it would be irritating if someone keeps talking about every single thing. Imagine you are reading a book and when the character is coming down from their room instead of saying that the author says he came out of closet and bedroom and closed the door walked to the stair etc etc...this is a similar situation for me", "NTA. Sometimes your partner needs to vent for a while and that\u2019s normal but if it\u2019s everyday then It\u2019s understandable why it can grow annoying.\nFor some reason Reddit and this sub has a bias towards venters/one sided talkers and only considers their feelings but not the feelings of person on the other end so you\u2019re gonna get alot of YTA.\nBut anyone who has dealt with someone who talks for a long time, doesn\u2019t get to the point, isn\u2019t a great story teller, doesn\u2019t allow you to input, etc. knows that it can grow old. \nMaybe you and you were wife aren\u2019t compatible, and she is better off with someone who doesn\u2019t mind her communication style you find someone who doesn\u2019t communicate that, but assuming you don\u2019t want to divorce I don\u2019t think you an asshole for how your feeling.
