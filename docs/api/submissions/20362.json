Dude, she takes half an hour every evening to verbally process her VERY STRESSFUL job.   Just listen.  If it's REALLY that hard for you to listen for thirty minutes, you probably need to get out of the relationship and spend some time working on yourself.  \n\n\nIt just blows my mind that someone would take the time to share her job--a large part of her life that doesn't directly involve you--and your response is \"ugh, it's such a waste of my time to hear about your day!\"  Do you even like this person?", "YTA- \n\nShe may be dumping her entire day on you, but did you ever think maybe she does so as a mechanism to unload the stress from the day or let out some thoughts she couldn\u2019t otherwise tell anyone else besides you, (I assume) one of the people she trusts the most? Her job sounds like a lot and it\u2019s nice to have someone with no skin in the game to listen. \n\nI think you need to soften your view on this. If you love her, listen to her long annoying drawn out stories. You might miss them one day.", "Why be in a relationship if you aren't willing to listen to the other person?  It sounds like she has a stressful job, and needed to decompress.

Do you even like your girlfriend?", "NAH - I have people in my life that do this to me and it SUCKS.  Unfortunately it is useful to them to have someone who listens but it can feel like a trap if they go on and on.\n\nShe's not the asshole either.  She wants to vent and trusts you and you've allowed this long enough that it's part of the relationship.  She wants to talk to you and this feels meaningful and therapeutic to her.\n\nHowever, I totally get what you mean about 1 way conversations and being talked at.  It feels like you're a trapped animal looking for an escape. You can see the time going by and there's just no pause. You try to chime in and really the flow just goes on as if you haven't.  If there's a pause at all it's to look at you for an expected answer to confirm your listening or to offer agreement.\n\nMaybe I'm projecting, but does that sound familiar? If so I totally understand.  That's my mother and I for years. So...I don't think you're wrong to be annoyed once you find you've landed yourself in that cycle.\n\nThat said,  I don't know how tactfully you told her and I get for her why it didn't feel good. Everyone needs to vent and your partner is a natural place to do it.  And something she probably feels she needs feel a partner because it's therapeutic. \n\nBut it's not at all therapeutic for you.  It's stressful.  And it sounds like you're starting to resent it and it's creating friction that's unpleasant for you both.  (\"Are you even listening to me?\")\n\nYou know what doesn't feel good? Having someone give you a boundary or enforcing it. That's what you tried to do.  Setting boundaries doesn't feel good either but sometimes you have to if it's important to you. \n\nIf you can find ways to have 2 easy conversations without feeling trapped, great.

Sometimes your partner needs to vent for a while and that\u2019s normal but if it\u2019s everyday then It\u2019s understandable why it can grow annoying.\nFor some reason Reddit and this sub has a bias towards venters/one sided talkers and only considers their feelings but not the feelings of person on the other end so you\u2019re gonna get alot of YTA.\nBut anyone who has dealt with someone who talks for a long time, doesn\u2019t get to the point, isn\u2019t a great story teller, doesn\u2019t allow you to input, etc. knows that it can grow old. \nMaybe you and you were wife aren\u2019t compatible, and she is better off with someone who doesn\u2019t mind her communication style you find someone who doesn\u2019t communicate that, but assuming you don\u2019t want to divorce I don\u2019t think you an asshole for how your feeling.
