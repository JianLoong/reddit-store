Dude, she takes half an hour every evening to verbally process her VERY STRESSFUL job.   Just listen.  If it's REALLY that hard for you to listen for thirty minutes, you probably need to get out of the relationship and spend some time working on yourself.  \n\n\nIt just blows my mind that someone would take the time to share her job--a large part of her life that doesn't directly involve you--and your response is \"ugh, it's such a waste of my time to hear about your day!\"  Do you even like this person?", "YTA- \n\nShe may be dumping her entire day on you, but did you ever think maybe she does so as a mechanism to unload the stress from the day or let out some thoughts she couldn\u2019t otherwise tell anyone else besides you, (I assume) one of the people she trusts the most? Her job sounds like a lot and it\u2019s nice to have someone with no skin in the game to listen. \n\nI think you need to soften your view on this. If you love her, listen to her long annoying drawn out stories. You might miss them one day.", "Why be in a relationship if you aren't willing to listen to the other person?  It sounds like she has a stressful job, and needed to decompress.

Do you even like your girlfriend?", "NAH - I have people in my life that do this to me and it SUCKS.  Unfortunately it is useful to them to have someone who listens but it can feel like a trap if they go on and on.\n\nShe's not the asshole either.  She wants to vent and trusts you and you've allowed this long enough that it's part of the relationship.  She wants to talk to you and this feels meaningful and therapeutic to her.\n\nHowever, I totally get what you mean about 1 way conversations and being talked at.  It feels like you're a trapped animal looking for an escape. You can see the time going by and there's just no pause. You try to chime in and really the flow just goes on as if you haven't.  If there's a pause at all it's to look at you for an expected answer to confirm your listening or to offer agreement.\n\nMaybe I'm projecting, but does that sound familiar? If so I totally understand.  That's my mother and I for years. So...I don't think you're wrong to be annoyed once you find you've landed yourself in that cycle.\n\nThat said,  I don't know how tactfully you told her and I get for her why it didn't feel good. Everyone needs to vent and your partner is a natural place to do it.  And something she probably feels she needs feel a partner because it's therapeutic. \n\nBut it's not at all therapeutic for you.  It's stressful.  And it sounds like you're starting to resent it and it's creating friction that's unpleasant for you both.  (\"Are you even listening to me?\")\n\nYou know what doesn't feel good? Having someone give you a boundary or enforcing it. That's what you tried to do.  Setting boundaries doesn't feel good either but sometimes you have to if it's important to you. \n\nIf you can find ways to have 2 easy conversations without feeling trapped, great.

Sometimes your partner needs to vent for a while and that\u2019s normal but if it\u2019s everyday then It\u2019s understandable why it can grow annoying.\nFor some reason Reddit and this sub has a bias towards venters/one sided talkers and only considers their feelings but not the feelings of person on the other end so you\u2019re gonna get alot of YTA.\nBut anyone who has dealt with someone who talks for a long time, doesn\u2019t get to the point, isn\u2019t a great story teller, doesn\u2019t allow you to input, etc. knows that it can grow old. \nMaybe you and you were wife aren\u2019t compatible, and she is better off with someone who doesn\u2019t mind her communication style you find someone who doesn\u2019t communicate that, but assuming you don\u2019t want to divorce I don\u2019t think you an asshole for how your feeling.

Unless your gf doesn\u2019t allow you to engage in what she\u2019s saying.\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with this before. But I\u2019ve learned that if I\u2019m not in the right headspace to listen to my partner, I say so - \u201chey, I really want to hear that story but I\u2019m having a hard time paying attention right now. Can we pick this up a bit later once I\u2019ve had time to decompress?\u201d My issue is that I often need to kind of \u201cturn off\u201d for like an hour after I\u2019m done with work. Do something that doesn\u2019t take a lot of processing/brain power. And that\u2019s perfectly acceptable, as is someone\u2019s need to process their day by talking through it.\n\nIn addition to stating when I don\u2019t have the capacity to give the level of attention they deserve in that moment, when we do have chats about our days, it\u2019s important I\u2019m allowed to join in (and Vice versa). This isn\u2019t a linear conversation or story most of the time thanks to my ADHD, but from a listening standpoint I\u2019ve picked up a few hacks to follow along to longer stories. \n\nI have to be able to make comments, not ones that interject to take over the conversation, but more like commentary on what\u2019s happening in the story they\u2019re telling me. If something is ridiculous, I say so. If it sounds overwhelming or frustrating in any way, I say so. \n\nSince I haven\u2019t met any of my partner\u2019s coworkers, I don\u2019t have a face to go with names - I\u2019m not expected to remember every single person, though.

Doing this shows that not only have I listened and remembered past work stories, but I\u2019m actively following along to the current one.\n\nThe way you went about this isn\u2019t the most mature from a relationship communication standpoint, but please note that my saying that is very much pot calling kettle. I\u2019m not great at more serious conversations, but I also have the tendency to believe other people\u2019s response/reactions to what I have to say is my responsibility to manage. It\u2019s not! Despite that, in a relationship I think it\u2019s important to have that kind of empathy when broaching difficult discussions. Not to avoid a negative response outright, but to make the negative emotion land a little softer than a bomb that triggers automatic defense from the other person.\n\nTALK TO YOUR PARTNER.

I\u2019m not telling you that it\u2019s unreasonable to listen to her problems, but the teacher in the relationship must also realize how over-consuming their jobs are, and that many of us non-educators decided to take careers without high stress levels expressly not to have to deal with the impacts of persistent stress after-hours.

Mine is when he gets home from golf, since we both WFH together, but I get to word-vomit the plot of whatever romance I was reading, and why the MMC is a dick or why the FMC needs to get over herself.

The man has basically read every good book I have because I read him all the funny bits, then explain the backstory, and why we love certain characters/tropes.

I get half an hour a day, and whenever the mood strikes him, I'll listen to car facts for hours just because the way his face lights up when he's passionate brings me such joy. In exchange. He knows all about the love triangle in my book and that Tom is nicer but also whiny and controlling so we hate that ship and like while the other guy DID kidnap her he IS also hotter and treats her like a person instead of an accessory so?

OP said at least 30 minutes, so some days it could be 2 hours. OP also said the way he decompresses after work is by listening to music, or doing something outside, or working out - all things that his girlfriends rants prevent him from doing. if you work a 9-5 how much free time do you really have in the evening - maybe 4 hours total? spending a plurality of that time listening to in depth rants with no opportunity to speak or decompress from your own stressful workday is completely unsustainable", "You have a serious inability to understand that orhers wants and needs may be different than yours and this \u201che obviously doesn\u2019t even live his wife\u201d shit on AITA is so pathetic and disgusting for the smallest frigging things", "It's alllllllll sports with my husband.
