{"id": 28035, "submission_id": "16xl9me", "title": "AITA for telling my wife I'm not going to sacrifice my hobbies just so that I can babysit?", "selftext": "My wife Jane (34F) and I (38M) have been together for 5 years. She also brought my step-daughter Emily (9F) into our marriage. We have her for four days a week (M-T) while she's at her dad's Fri-Sun.\n\nFrom the beginning, Jane told me Emily doesn't need a second father figure as she has her dad to fill that role. I was only supposed to be a trusted authority figure in case she ever needed anything. I didn't mind and try my best to respect that boundary. She's a sweet child anyway and doesn't cause trouble so it's not like I have to discipline her. Her father is also a good dad.\n\nEmily's dad recently got married and his wife has two kids of her own who are at their place Wednesday to Saturday and at their dads' Sunday to Tuesday. Emily and her new step-siblings don't get along at all. They're always fighting and it's pretty toxic.\n\nEmily's dad asked Jane if they change their custody schedule to match his step-kids' to keep the children apart. It's not a big deal in and of itself because we don't live far from each other so picking and dropping is no issue and she can easily be dropped off to school no matter where she stays. The issue is my wife agreed to it without consulting me.\n\nJane is currently doing a certification course for the next 12 months and they have classes on Saturdays from 9-5pm. She asked me if I can babysit Emily on Saturdays, but I can't because I play golf with my brother and sister on Saturday mornings from 8am-1pm. This has been our tradition from before Jane and Emily came into my life and I had told Jane from much before that this is important to me and my siblings. She asked if I can move to another day but that's not possible either because my siblings also have jobs and families of their own so Saturday was the best day for us. I told her she can hire a babysitter but she doesn't want to spend money when I can do it for free. \n\nI told her that wouldn't work for me. She then got mad and said golf is stupid and I should put my step-daughter over my siblings. That pissed me off so I told her I'm not going to sacrifice my hobbies just so that she can have a free babysitter. For the record, I don't have anything against Emily. I've babysat her before and she's a good kid. If there was a family emergency or if it was an occasional occurrence, then yeah I would cancel golf for that day to take care of her but I can't give up something this important to me for 12 months continuous.\n\nShe called me a selfish asshole and slept on the couch last night.

I think it\u2019s totally fair that she asks you to help out, but agreeing to it without talking to you, and assuming you\u2019d consistently do this is wild! Why did she agree and then work to loop you in after?!\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting that now that your wife needs your help, Emily is your \u201cstepdaughter\u201d where it seems like there was a clear boundary that you aren\u2019t a father figure. If your wife wants to revisit what your role is to Emily, totally cool, but it shouldn\u2019t be because she needs a babysitter.", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like this is something that should have been worked out more carefully as a family before agreeing to. Is it possible that the dad/step mom change their kids schedule as well? That way they have her when Jane is busy with certification courses. \n\nInfo: \nIs there a kids class or something like that where you go golfing? Could help integrate the two if a schedule change is not possible.", "NTA. Your wife can't say her daughter doesn't need you as a stepfather, but then expect you to step up as a stepfather every single Saturday when she needs you. She can to hire a babysitter. Dad and stepmom also need to step it up and work on the relationship between the new stepsiblings and get that under control because there are going to be times they are all together in the same house, that's just life.", "NTA. Pretty straightforward. Sounds like the child's parents need to figure this out, not the \n\n>trusted authority figure", "NTA\n\n>Jane told me Emily doesn't need a second father figure as she has her dad to fill that role.\n\nI honestly would remind her of this.", "NTA. The ex and his family can\u2019t make the situation work with Emily. She is being dumped on you, the person your wife stated isn\u2019t a father figure for her.", "NTA\n\nWhen your wife has custody of Emily, she has to take care of her or find childcare. It's one thing to ask you to help out from time to time by babysitting, it's quite another to make you her primary source of childcare.  \n\nYou don't have children and shouldn't make sacrifices for her daughter, that's not the role of a stepparent.", "You let her know from the beginning that your Saturdays would not change. Plus she has no right to accept the deal without telling you especially since it so clearly will affect your life for the next year. Does she really not have any family that can take the kid for those hours?\n\n>She then got mad and said golf is stupid and I should put my step-daughter over my siblings.\n\nFuck that! Your siblings are your blood relatives whom you are close to, Emily is just your step daughter, and your siblings have been in you life a hell of a lot longer.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

That is just beyond fucked up. \n\nNTA.", "NTA for obvious reasons - I also think it\u2019s such irresponsible parenting for Emily\u2019s mom and dad to ignore the fact that her new step siblings are bullying her out of her own dad\u2019s house, they\u2019re just going to change up all of their lives instead, so they don\u2019t have to deal with it.", "NTA but your wife is for for making this change without discussing it with you", "NTA, your wife shouldn't have agreed without talking to you and before making sure she had everything planned out.

This is something for her dad to handle. If he married someone whose kids don\u2019t get along with his daughter he needs to come up with a solution. At the very least during that time frame.", "NTA.

That can seriously damage a kid, and you clearly do care for her.", "NTa.. not your problem, oh trusted adult only... this is the hill to die on", "NTA. She can make other childcare plans.

The step daughter whose custody time was changed without your inclusion? That stepdaughter? Also a spouse dissing their SO's hobbies just to get something over and above that hobby is an asshole.\n\nAs this child is \"Your wifes daughter\" ostensibly and put in a camp that is functionally not family to you, than this sounds like a failure to plan accordingly for your wife, and as they say her failure to plan does not constitute a problem for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "\"I am sorry what I told you about my golf days with my siblings on Saturdays, since before we met, was not important to you.

Don\u2019t. Babysit. Your. Own. Children. That\u2019s called being a parent.) But you don\u2019t claim to be and it wasn\u2019t asked of you. If that works for your family, I\u2019m not going to judge.

It's not fair to expect you to make sacrifices to accommodate Emily's custody schedule when Jane didn't even discuss it with you before making changes. Either you are a parent and have a right to be consulted about decisions, or you are not a parent and don't have to take responsibility for the consequences. She can't have it both ways. \n\nThis is also highly unfair to Emily as well as you. She's losing a weekend day with a parent and getting fobbed off with an \"authority figure\" because her new step-siblings don't like her.

Now for a stretch:  Is it possible your wife intentionally wants to disrupt your Saturday golf game?", "NTA but I don\u2019t get how people expect to date someone with a child and just be totally removed\u2026 It\u2019s callous thinking. I get not being the primary go to person but in all these stories it\u2019s so dumb to not expect to fill some parental duties when dating someone with a child. That child is a central part of the person you are dating you can\u2019t just compartmentalize that or treat the child like a chore the bio parent is solely responsible for. I just feel like if you choose to date someone with kids at some point you will get stuck doing some childcare duties. And it shouldn\u2019t be such a big deal that you do. Again it\u2019s kind of heartless to date someone with kids but then treat them as a separate entity entirely that you have 0 concern for.\n\nBasically people need to stop dating others that have kids if they aren\u2019t ready to some extent even small integrate that child into their life. The only excuse is if the child is a full grown adult it doesn\u2019t matter but again a little heartless and naive to think if your partner has a young kid that you\u2019ll never be relied on somehow for rides, care, or some management.", "NTA.

Spending that smaller amount of time together might help quell some of the current issues while giving them enough time together to start getting to know each other and learning to get along better.", "Definitely the asshole. You are prioritizing your siblings in over a literal child. Aint not damage done to anyone except the child. Please discuss this with you wife and settle this properly! I understand your \"hobbies\" but seriously? Why be a parent (step may it be) when you clearly can't.", "ESH. Your description of being told not to e a father figure I take with a grain of a salt. We\u2019re only hearing your version of this story. Let\u2019s say that\u2019s true, the fact is you are a step parent. You married someone with a child so that is a responsibility to you agreed to when you said \u201cI do\u201d. Frankly it is just a golf game and you could find a way to work around this. Tell me, someone is on the hospital that you care about, you gonna say \u201cI\u2019m busy playing golf so can\u2019t see you today\u201d. \n\nFrankly many AITA posts (like yours) have a real narcissistic bent to them. When you enter a marriage it isn\u2019t a relationship of convenience. Both partners need to respect each others dreams/goals/desires, but you also need to compromise and help each other out.\n\nNon-edit: wow my autocorrect created many terrible grammar errors.

This definitely should have been discussed with you first. And Jane needs to be consistent with what her expectation for your role for Emily is.

Perhaps Saturdays can be the one day Emily is with her step siblings and the dad and stepmom can help facilitate that relationship. Completely separating the kids is a total AH move and they\u2019re just dumping Emily off to make things easier on themselves.", "NTA. Your wife defined the nature of your relationship with Emily as \"not being a father figure\" because Emily \"has a dad.\" Got it. So she can't now suddenly change this dynamic for her own convenience. \n\nSpending time to bond with your siblings sounds important to you, and you get to carve out those moments in your life. You shouldn't be forced to give that up for the convenience of your wife's ex and his new family. Because this is what it is. \n\nThe ex can't handle the toxicity between his daughter and his stepchildren. Instead of stepping up to his role as the *actual dad,* he's chosen to take this step, shunting his daughter off on Saturdays. \n\nHow can this be good for Emily? On Saturdays, a precious weekend when a child usually bonds with her family, she's going to be sent off to her mother's. But her mom won't be home all day, so what kind of bonding or quality time will she get with anyone? Nada. \n\nYour wife should stick up for Emily and insist on a schedule that benefits the child. She should also respect you and not belittle your very wholesome choice of hobby and how well bonded you are with your siblings. Now *that* is a goal she should aspire for with her own child.", "NTA.\n\nInfo: would you be okay with watch her from the time you got home from your golf outing until she got home?\n\nIf your wife isn't willing to compromise with something like that, she needs to find a different route. She already said \"This isn't your daughter,\" so why would you be expected to act like a parent to her out of convenience? That math isn't quite mathing. \n\nShe's selfish for thinking only her life being disrupted matters, but maybe a compromise could be met as long as you were okay with that. Otherwise, she needs to talk it over with Emily's father and say \"Hey, I jumped the gun; is there any way you could shift a day as well as Saturdays don't work for us?\" \n\nTotal AH move for not talking to you, OP. I'm sorry she did that.
