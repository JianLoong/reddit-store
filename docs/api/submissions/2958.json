My 14-year-old daughter Abby just hit 210 pounds, this started about 1.5 years ago when me and my ex's divorce was finalized. Growing up Abby was always an average weight until we went 50/50 on custody. When we were together I would do the cooking and shopping. We ate a pretty good diet with some junk food thrown in. The divorce was kinda messy but we sent the kids to therapy and it was doable. Abby started gaining weight when we went 50/50.\n\nAt the beginning I just thought it was gaining weight before a growth spurt, that wasn't the case. At my house she was eating okay but at her fathers it is all junk food, he doesn't cook and to make it worse he lives by if it is on your plate you eat it. So in short he is giving her way to big protions of crap. I have talked to him so many times, I have tried to let her serve her own food amount, instead of him loading up her plate. He will not budge.\n\nI got Abby into sports which she enjoys for the most part but it's not enough to stop the weight gain. I went to the doctor and nutritionist and it comes down to her basically eating three times the calories at her father's place. So since Abby likes soccer, I found an overnight camp from Friday night to Sunday night, the days that he usually has Abby. Abby seemed on board with the idea and this way her dad will not be feeding her or even really seeing her for the next couple of months.\n\nI informed him of the camp and that Abby wants to do it. It was a big argument that he circled around to her weight. He accused me of sending her to fat camp.

Depending on what state you are in, Abby can make a request for custody review on grounds of abuse, neglect, or inability to properly take care of a child.

Is she afraid not to or do the consequences make her feel miserable for the rest of the time she's there?", "Yeah that's not fat camp. It's sports camp.

But can he be convinced that she can at least serve herself her own plate?   \n\n\nAll that being said, maybe the best thing is for her to speak with her therapist again and maybe you (but I think a third party is a better choice) and come up with ways to communicate with her father and possibly go on strike and simply not eat more than she wants to.    \n\n\nKids shouldn't be on diets, but they can taught healthy habits.

A lot of communities have something like that, and if Abby learns to cook healthy meals, she'll be less likely to eat the garbage her Dad serves her, and she'll probably want to show off her new cooking skills when she visits her Dad. \n\nYou've done a great job getting her interested in sports and encouraging her to be active.

I am not comfortable eating if other people aren\u2019t eating; when I do eat it is often at later hours when no one is around to see me. It\u2019s miserable. The fat camp I went to focused on \u201cgroup settings\u201d where I had to get up and tell a whole room what I ate that day and how much I exercised and I was judged and graded on it.

It\u2019s important to not deprive your body because that often time leads to obesity, the fluctuation between too much and way too little that is. Your body is bloated with water to heal itself from inconsistent \u201ctoo little\u201d periods which makes you think you \u201cgained weight\u201d so you take in way too little again, eventually the body goes over to holding onto surplus calories because it\u2019s scared of being deprived. And the cycle repeats. The bloating is due to cell damage and water retention helps with healing them. The only way I could break this starving, eating, bloating and gaining, starving cycle was to learn to eat whatever I want to help my body to feel safe and heal. You are advised to eat as much as you can in the beginning. I gained weight massively in short time and kept eating despite becoming more \u201cfat\u201d, it was depressing but I dedicated myself and tried to trust the process. 14 months in I couldn\u2019t believe it despite hearing from others that would happen: I lost weight slowly but gradually without any change in diet. I didn\u2019t obsess over food anymore because I gave myself approval to eat everything whenever.

For some it\u2019s on the thinner side for others it\u2019s more curvy but overall it\u2019s a healthy weight range your body would easily stay in. Your body needs to learn that it will not be deprived but taken care of and when it believes in you it will stop retaining water and holding onto anything you eat in desperate efforts.

Empower her to be able to cut her dad's behavior off at the pass- if she states ahead of time she wants to cook for both of them, or figures out what time he usually schedules meals and starts making her own food a bit before then, then she can hopefully avoid some of the junk. Send her with groceries, if you have to! Honestly... I wouldn't necessarily implement it without checking with your lawyer, because idk how he might be able to turn you \"undermining\" him against you in court, but if you can't get Abby excited about eating healthy at her dad's for its own sake I'd consider bribery. \"If you can make a serious effort to have one healthy meal a day while you're at dad's, then we can go to a movie when you're back with me\" or something. I say serious effort because you need to be prepared for her to fail- I don't really trust your ex not to make her eat a junky meal anyway, and you don't want her to get demoralized at failing, getting punished by her dad, AND not getting the promised reward. The court will probably be more sympathetic to you if she's taking an active role and being prevented than if both parents are just imposing contrary wills, too. I think the most important thing you can do is get her actively involved- 14 is old enough to get why you're concerned and to take agency for her food at least a little, so at least you can cut off some of the longterm unhealthy attitudes he seems determined to instill.", "I know it\u2019s well intentioned, but please do not send your kid there. Even if she\u2019s on board, that camp will absolutely fuck her up for life. Take it from a person who has been through it.", "NTA. You\u2019re not even actively shaming your daughter for her weight and not actively making her feel bad for the way she looks. You sound like you genuinely care about her overall health, not her image. \n\nEx is just twisting this around. Keep Abby away from ex. He\u2019s not really taking care of her at all.", "I'm sure I'm gonna get downvoted but are you sending your daughter to a fat camp that has soccer or an actual soccer camp where the focus is soccer and you are hoping the end result will help with weight loss? As Y T A if you are specifically tricking Abby into a fat camp with the premise of it being a soccer camp, but I am inclined to think that is not the case here.\n\nThings to think about is will your child custody allow you to make this decision for what happens on dads custody time? Are you sure he is overfeeding her vs her making a decision about food. Have you talked to Abby at all about the weight issue? I am not saying you should dwell into it as, as a overweight person people mentioning my weight was never actually helpful, but if you haven't talked about weight or eating at dads house maybe see her thoughts. At 14 she is old enough to make food decisions without every bite being dictated by a parent. \n\nBut in general as long as you are not breaking your custody agreement and it is actually a soccer camp that she wants to go to, there is no way you would be TA for wanting to send her. And honestly if your ex is really force feeding your daughter and refusing to send her to a camp she wants to go to, you should look at your custody arrangement.", "Nta.

Sending her to a soccer camp won\u2019t change his weird wish to control her food intake. She doesn\u2019t need weight loss, she needs a different visitation agreement.", "I was going to go the other way until I actually read it. NTA at all. You're not forcing her and she wants to go. She wants to get healthy and her dad isn't helping on that end at all.", "NTA. But please and I mean please tread lightly when discussing weight.

As far as my doctor is concerned I have no medical reason to be fat, despite following the EXACT same weight gain and trouble losing weight that my dad's side with thyroid trouble has. I am positive I have a hidden thyroid issue BECAUSE my Thyroid is always high normal but in the \"normal range\" which science says is a guestimate and that there are several thyroid sufferers that hide in those numbers, but getting a doctor to listen is like asking the sun to stop being hot.\n\nBecause of people who had this mindset of overweight = abuse. My mother actually DID end up abusing me and it was more detrimental to my physical and mental wellbeing then being larger ever was. After 5 years of constantly being told she was an abusive mom and me being horribly bullied and nothing bringing the weight off she STARVED ME. Literally Starved me. A full year of one 500 calorie a day meal. Yeah, I got down to 160 lbs in thay year, but my body consumed itself, my hair fell out in huge chunks, and I felt ravenous 24/7. It left me with an actual unhealthy relationship with food that we have not been able to fully break. On top of that my body and energy never recovered from the starvation and my bone and muscle health declined no matter how active I got.\n\nWhen I first got off such a horrible diet, the tiniest pang of hunger would mentally break me. I would panic eat at any tinge of hunger. I have since been able to tolerate more hunger, but despite no medical reason that can be found. If I wait too long to eat I become unable to make food because I shake so hard I can barely walk and I can even become violently ill and paranoid. Meaning that being hungry too long causes me to suffer a prolonged and devestating panic attack.\n\nTo this day I don't blame my MOTHER for abusing me. She has mental health troubles of her own. I blame the people who pounded into my mom that it was her fault I was fat and that she was a horrible abusive mom for letting me get fat. Despite the fact that she didn't do anything wrong. Nothing in my diet and activity level changed from before and after puberty. Hell if I had to say my activity level changed I'd say I actually became MORE active after puberty because I couldn't sit still (Adhd \u00d7 anxiety for the win I guess)", "Ehhh. I call it the pendulum swing effect. Fat shaming and fatphobia is so bad and actually celebrated in this country to the point it is LITERALLY killing people. Also people in this country have an unnaturally warped sense of \"promoting healthy weight.\" \n\nSo advocates for the end of such celebrity status of fat shaming have to swing extreme the other way to counter the fact doctors think a 500 calorie a day diet is an acceptable way to lose weight when no nutritionist would ever agree with that being healthy weight loss. \n\nDoctors who attempt to guilt and force patients to have major life altering surgery as the first thing after seeing a new patient that has no guarentees of working, especially if it is medical related weight, and usually has no reversal, meaning their life is irreperably changed for the worse if it doesn't work.\n\nOr the doctor who chooses to apply weight to every situation and causes treatable cancers to become terminal, and diseases that are easily treatable to kill people, making it less likely others in similar circumstances will seek medical care. Permanently reducing quality of life ect. All while being protected by other \"promoters of healthy weight\" by victim blaming the obese person wouldn't have died if they had been skinny the doctor isn't at fault for treating the obvious problem, even if the symptoms don't correllated.\n\nOn top of that people act like gym fat shaming isn't a thing. It is, We see it all the time which drives people getting healthy to run away. People act like fat discrimination in employment isn't a thing, it is, and generally make it impossible for a person who is fat to get healthy since they can't afford healthy options.\n\nOn top of the fact just existing with fat is enough that openly mocking a person who is fat, either making whale jokes, noises, cow, pig, and moo or oink noises and such are all concidered perfectly acceptable because \"being fat is a choice\" is \"promoting healthy weight\" by embarrassing and humiliating people until they get desperate and lose the weight by ANY MEANS NESSESSARY which science found out years ago actually leads to MORE weight gain in the average person not less.\n\nUntil the US gets it's act together and starts actually noticing that they have zero idea how to actually promote healthy weight, the advocates have to be extreme. Especially since even now people will say it is their god and socially given RIGHT and OBLIGATION to scream fat arse and profanities at fat people until they get with the program and get skinny.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

How people think/wish things would work and how they actually work are often miles apart, but if you point that out, you're the bad guy. I see people all the time on here saying things like \"YTA because you didn't divorce your asshole husband and go to court to get full custody and keep your kids away from that abuse!\" When in reality, for a lot of people and situations, the only way to guarantee protection from abuse is to stay with the abusive partner and keep an eagle eye on the child. Because in a lot of places, it doesn't matter even if you have proof of abuse. My cousin's ex threw her out of a closed window on the second floor. She was hospitalized for almost a week. And yes, he was charged for it. But he still got 50/50 custody because \"he never abused the child.\" That is my cousin's reality; she has to hand her young child over to this monster that hospitalized her every other week and wonder exactly what is happening, if she will get her child back safely or even alive. \n\nIt's worth it to try, I think, to get the custody amended. Especially if the daughter is 14 and she wants to be away from dad and is willing to testify to that. But the people acting like it would be a slam dunk just because they feel it's wrong, are just, so wrong themselves."]}
