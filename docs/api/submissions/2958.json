My 14-year-old daughter Abby just hit 210 pounds, this started about 1.5 years ago when me and my ex's divorce was finalized. Growing up Abby was always an average weight until we went 50/50 on custody. When we were together I would do the cooking and shopping. We ate a pretty good diet with some junk food thrown in. The divorce was kinda messy but we sent the kids to therapy and it was doable. Abby started gaining weight when we went 50/50.\n\nAt the beginning I just thought it was gaining weight before a growth spurt, that wasn't the case. At my house she was eating okay but at her fathers it is all junk food, he doesn't cook and to make it worse he lives by if it is on your plate you eat it. So in short he is giving her way to big protions of crap. I have talked to him so many times, I have tried to let her serve her own food amount, instead of him loading up her plate. He will not budge.\n\nI got Abby into sports which she enjoys for the most part but it's not enough to stop the weight gain. I went to the doctor and nutritionist and it comes down to her basically eating three times the calories at her father's place. So since Abby likes soccer, I found an overnight camp from Friday night to Sunday night, the days that he usually has Abby. Abby seemed on board with the idea and this way her dad will not be feeding her or even really seeing her for the next couple of months.\n\nI informed him of the camp and that Abby wants to do it. It was a big argument that he circled around to her weight. He accused me of sending her to fat camp.

Depending on what state you are in, Abby can make a request for custody review on grounds of abuse, neglect, or inability to properly take care of a child.

Is she afraid not to or do the consequences make her feel miserable for the rest of the time she's there?", "Yeah that's not fat camp. It's sports camp.

But can he be convinced that she can at least serve herself her own plate?   \n\n\nAll that being said, maybe the best thing is for her to speak with her therapist again and maybe you (but I think a third party is a better choice) and come up with ways to communicate with her father and possibly go on strike and simply not eat more than she wants to.    \n\n\nKids shouldn't be on diets, but they can taught healthy habits.

A lot of communities have something like that, and if Abby learns to cook healthy meals, she'll be less likely to eat the garbage her Dad serves her, and she'll probably want to show off her new cooking skills when she visits her Dad. \n\nYou've done a great job getting her interested in sports and encouraging her to be active.

I am not comfortable eating if other people aren\u2019t eating; when I do eat it is often at later hours when no one is around to see me. It\u2019s miserable. The fat camp I went to focused on \u201cgroup settings\u201d where I had to get up and tell a whole room what I ate that day and how much I exercised and I was judged and graded on it.

You might as well come clean with your opinions, feelings and desires, because it sounds like they\u2019ll be coming out in court shortly if you can\u2019t come to an amicable agreement.", "I hesitated to suggest renegotiating custody arrangements since I\u2019m not familiar with it, but I agree with you on all this", "Keep in mind the 14 year old might not choose OP if given the option.", "Only if the court says so.", "What was traumatizing to me was the lack of privacy I had at this camp. I couldn\u2019t eat or drink anything without the entire room knowing about it. I was made to be aware of every step I take and I how no matter how much I exercise a day it will never be more than the calories I need to maintain to survive basic function: but they put such an emphasis on lowering your calories that it became a double edged sword. Most days I was eating less than 1000. I\u2019m 25f and my calories range from 800-1200 a day. And that\u2019s when I\u2019m forcing myself to eat. I don\u2019t say I have an eating disorder because I am still overweight and I do have vitamins and basic nutrition to help me survive: but my relationship with food is irrevocable damaged by what I endured at that camp. Food is not safe for me; food is stressful. The way they used food to weaponize your heart there was horrid. They were heavy on promotion of weight watchers and other short-term weight losses like atkins or keto. Now that I am working with a proper licensed nutritionist: I know that these short term diet programs do not work and never will in the long run. It is about lifestyle changes and cutting yourself a fucking break. By removing the \u201cimportance\u201d of food and focusing on fueling my body rather than feeding my body has done wonders for my relationship with food. I still have a long ways to go, but I think about how much easier my life could be if I never went to that awful fat camp. Especially when all these years later my parents admitted that I shouldn\u2019t have been in there. Awful.", "[deleted]", "Are you choosing to be obtuse. \n\nHe\u2019s abusing their daughter. What solution is gonna get him to stop if he is not listening to her suggestions?", "Then OP will have offer a trade and hope he'll accept. That is what comes with having a custody agreement.", "No he doesn\u2019t, but they have a court-issued custody agreement, so OP doesn\u2019t actually have the right to violate that. She needs to take him to court and get their custody order changed ASAP. \nNTA (and frankly, a great mom), but she would be violating the court order.", "I\u2019m sure it is! But OP treating it as a way to lose weight sounds like an unhealthy environment. I hope I\u2019m wrong, but OP asked for judgement.", "Don\u2019t worry, I read the whole thing! I\u2019m concerned that OP treating soccer camp as a way for her daughter to lose weight is going to cause an eating disorder. I understand that it is not a fat camp, but the fact that her father calls it that may be telling of the home environment OP is creating.", "I mentioned her age for the purpose of cooking her own meals and not depending on him. But if he\u2019s that controlling then cooking isn\u2019t an option for her.", "Especially if there's emotional damage. The world is pretty fatphobic. I'd wonder if there's an impact to herself esteem.", "exactly, and if you get doctors \"orders\" to modify her diet for health reasons and father refuses to cooperate, then you have another angle.", "She hates it, but wants a relationship with her dad.\n\nIt doesn't help that he basically has said if he loses any custody he will probably walk out of her life. I doubt that is true but he has said that.\n\nIts a mess", "Yes this is unfortunately true. But I can see being in OPs shoes and desperate for a workaround and settling on a soccer camp my kid would enjoy. \n\nIt sucks for her because she\u2019s literally watching as her ex abuses her child and can\u2019t do anything about it. I feel really sorry for her.", "I\u2019m reading that it\u2019s already a sport that she plays and enjoys, and she\u2019s not being forced to it at all and seems enthusiastic about the camp.", "she encouraged her to play sports, which she enjoys and wants to continue. it boggles my mind that you think that that's shaming. what alternative would you prefer? that she restricts her calories at her house to make up for the excess she gets when she's with her dad? that would be a lot more damaging than sports. OP said that overfeeding is not considered abuse where she lives, so filing for full custody is not the easy solution you seem to assume it is.", "I mean, Abby said she wants to do it. Also there's nothing wrong with encouraging an active and healthy lifestyle.", "I do agree that he\u2019s abusing their daughter.  There\u2019s no doubt at all. \n\nUntil proof and a timeline of this is established, and she\u2019s ready to further limit the daughters time with her father, she has to adhere to the custody agreement or she\u2019s the one in the wrong. She\u2019s gotta stay on the good side of the law. \n\nWhen she\u2019s got her receipts I think she should go for his neck.", "sure, you're right. really sucks for the kid being force fed absurd amounts of food, but yes, custody agreement.", "Um...I mean, exercise IS a healthy way to lose weight. She also said Abby wants to go. Maybe Abby is very excited about sports, and wants to pursue it further. This also kill two birds with one stone, since she will be eating healthier.", "She\u2019s not really treating camp as a way to lose weight per se, but a way to avoid the unhealthy environment of her father\u2019s house. This is in no way a \u201cfat camp\u201d, and Abby is on board because she loves soccer.", "The mom is using soccer camp as a way to shield the kid from her dad force feeding her 3 days a week. Any camp - even weekends with grandma - would achieve that aim. Mom\u2019s just picked a sports camp the kid likes. Mom believes the daughter eats healthy when allowed to choose her own portions and isn\u2019t pressuring the kid to diet.", "you missed the entire point. geez", "I too would have suggested her cooking but he seems like he likes to control the food in the house.", "Not to be overly harsh here, but she'd probably be better off, if that's his attitude towards a situation where her best interests need to be put first and her voice needs to be heard and respected. I'm sorry you're in this situation.", "With this comment from dad, the abuse is not just around food, it\u2019s emotional/psychological. It\u2019s manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe food would be considered neglect, I.ez not providing nutritious food for the child. It\u2019s way better than nothing if the parent can\u2019t afford anything else, but if it has health-related consequences and dad doesn\u2019t do anything, it\u2019s neglect.", "There is a possibility that she could still have some time with her dad but less than now. With the stuff he said about losing custody and walking out of her life, has he said that to Abby or just to you?", "So he is controlling AND abusive, what a winner. I can see why you divorced him.\n\nI agree with others saying this isn't just a case of overeating but of him force feeding her. \n\nI'm glad you are getting lawyers involved before he does lasting damage to your daughter. If she ends up being diabetic because of this.", "\u201cFor the most part\u201d she enjoys it. Call it active lifestyle all you want this girl is on a path to a serious eating disorder a camp isn\u2019t gonna do anything she needs to take custody instead of using short term solutions", "[deleted]", "We don\u2019t know how far that goes. If might be just \u201cI bough food so you have to eat it.\u201d But if she cooks her own meals then it won\u2019t affect him.\n\nIt\u2019s just a bad situation. I didn\u2019t know a father could be like that.", "THIS.  I hope you provide Abby therapy where she can constructively learn how to say NO to her dad.  Especially for her own self-esteem, mental and physical health. If her dad's attitude is that I'm going to basically force feed her and if you try to change custody agreements, I'm going to walk - that really doesn't speak well of him as a father. NTA", "Yeah basically it reads as \"if you don't eat, Dad won't love you anymore\" as well as saying that he's ready to leave at the drop of a hat.", "Agree.  \nShe\u2019s got a doctor and a nutritionist on board. \nWith enough input from them, going forward she should be able to petition for custody that may just allow him holidays. \nIn the meantime she\u2019s got to adhere to the custody agreement or she\u2019s the wrong one. I think?  I\u2019m unclear", "The father called it that -- nobody else did"]}
