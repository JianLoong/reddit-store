Hannah was only 17 at the time, so still a child, almost definitely still living at home, so I can only imagine how much of her life was thrown up into the air after they died. \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s super traumatised and terrified that she\u2019s going to lose her sister too, and whilst that\u2019s understandable, she really needs to see a therapist to help her deal with that trauma as there is no way she\u2019s going to be able to be around her sister constantly as she grows up. \n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for not wanting her to come on every single date, but try and understand what both she and your gf are going through at the moment, they both need each other now more than ever. You need to broach the subject of having some alone time with your gf carefully though. Talk to your gf first before it\u2019s gets brought up with Hannah. \n\nThat being said, your friend was a dick, and Hannah is right, it\u2019s none of his business.", "Hannah probably thinks something is going to happen to her sister, if she is away. She needs professional help and some grace from you.", "NAH, but depending on how recent the loss of their parents is, your relationship might not survive this if your gf wants to put her sister first for the time being (which is understandable) and you aren't cool with that (also understandable).", "Given the fact you said it was a year ago, NTA. Hannah needs a lot of therapy, I imagine she is terrified of something happening to her sister like what happened to their parents. This is an absolutely terrifying thought to have and I don\u2019t blame her for it. But you can help her by helping provide a safe space for her to talk to a professional about her grief and anxieties around it.", "NTA she can hangout with her other times I know their parents are gone but a date is a date\nHOWEVER\nthe example you chose was so dumb, over a joke your friend said really man you care to much about what other people think", "No one is the AH - People are commenting to get younger sister some help but it might be worth considering that older sister might be scared of losing her. Have a calm talk about it all and try to be as understanding as you can. Trauma can make us do strange things", "I went looking for the answer to how long ago she lost her parents. That info should be in the main post as it makes a difference.\n\nHannah is not the asshole here. Neither is Erica. I struggle to say you are here because this is a frustrating and difficult situation, though your anger in the specific situation was misplaced, and definitely should have been solely on the friend making an inappropriate comment. And from the way you talk about it, it sounds like you never had any real empathy for the situation.\n\nBoth of these girls just lost their parents. Hannah is barely an adult. She's still for all intents and purposes, a teenager. Hannah lost her parents before even graduating High School it sounds like. And You didn't mention them being in the accident. So I'm assuming the girls were at home and parents were out and never came home. It's a reasonable trauma for her to have a fear of her sister being gone and her not knowing what's going on or if she'll come home. If she's along with her sister, she knows she's safe. And I'm sure there's a massive understanding there from her sister. What Hannah needs, is a therapist. Someone to help her dissect and process the grief.\n\nErica probably thinks she's doing what she can to help her sister feel better. But this cannot continue the rest of her life. She needs to also encourage Hannah to seek therapy and probably could use some herself as well.\n\nNow, for you. I'm using the tone that I'm getting as I read this and the way you have written things. Is it right to assume that her parents went out for a \"non-essential\" kind of night? IE, it wasn't they were gone for work. but rather a date night? If so, it makes sense why Hannah is triggered by her sister going out for that. The way you discuss it, never liking it but not wanting to upset them, gives off the vibes that you were never even a little understanding of the situation. It gives me vibes that you lack empathy for the trauma both your gf and her sister have experienced. That, makes you an asshole in the overall situation at the beginning of it. Depending on when this started vs how long it's been going on, the frustration is understandable if there's been no change. But it doesn't change that you speak of this without any compassion for her. While you absolutely should encourage some therapy fofr both girls. you 100% need to reevaluate yourself and find some empathy.", "I agree with everyone here, Hannah needs therapy and while it sucks, you need to give more grace.\n\nI lost my mom unexpectedly at 23 and while I was older it still fucked me up and affects me to this day when it comes to my irrational fear of losing everyone I care about early and unexpectedly as well. \n\nI cannot imagine losing both parents so suddenly while still being a child so while you\u2019re not the asshole for feeling this way, you need to give a bit of grace.\n\nNAH", "I was originally going to say N T A, but I\u2019m going to give you a soft YTA. \n\nFrom the title alone, I think it\u2019s reasonable that you don\u2019t want your date\u2019s little sister tagging along everywhere you go. Kinda kills any sort of romantic tension when you\u2019ve essentially got a tag-along supervising the date. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how frequently you go on dates with Erica and how long they last, but if it\u2019s like, 2-3 times a week for maybe 4-6 hours, I think Erica needs to set some boundaries with Hannah because as sorry as everyone feels about Erica and Hannah\u2019s situation, I think it\u2019s unreasonable for Erica to not expect her partner to be uncomfortable that her little sister is tagging along on her dates. I\u2019m only guessing how many times you\u2019re taking Erica out, but if it\u2019s more times than I\u2019ve described, maybe you and Erica to set some boundaries of your own.\n\nSo in that situation I don\u2019t think you are in the wrong.\n\nWhere I do think you\u2019re in the wrong however is how you handled that confrontation in the restaurant. Your friend, like it or not, made a crass joke and Hannah reasonably got upset and defended herself. Instead of mediating the situation or just letting it go, you decided to be confrontational with Erica in that moment about not wanting Hannah on your dates, IN FRONT OF HANNAH AND YOUR FRIEND, I\u2019m not surprised Erica\u2019s upset with you because that was possibly the worst moment you could have started talking about not wanting Hannah on your dates.\n\nJust to reiterate, you\u2019re not the asshole for not wanting Hannah on your dates, but you are the asshole for how you handled the entire situation because it made you look insensitive and quite frankly mardy.", "Why can't the sisters hang out without him? So she wants to consume all of sister's free time and then third wheel  on her dates? Boundaries...but girlfriend  has to set them.", " but she said \"And even if I were his girlfriend, it would be none of your business.\" I was shocked at that and told Erica that I don't want her there. ---wtf is this shocking? Also this is the part that made you an asshole.", "This is above a Reddit forum\u2019s pay grade. \n\nThey lost their parents a year ago. It is obvious that the younger sister is especially troubled by this. Her older sister is presumably the only immediate family she has now. \n\nHannah needs grief counseling. Badly. She\u2019s clinging to her sister for fear of losing the last member of her family. She\u2019s scared. \n\nWould I want her on all my dates?  No. But I also wouldn\u2019t want to callously cut her loose on her own, given what she has endured. \n\nYour girlfriend is handling it better since she\u2019s older and more mature, but she also likely lets the younger sister join in for some of the same reasons. \n\nEncourage Erica to get Hannah some help. Counseling for Erica may not be a bad idea, either. We expect to outlive our parents, but we don\u2019t expect to lose them at 17 or 28, and not at the same time. Depending on the closeness of the family, that could be devastating. \n\nYou are a minor concern in this situation. Sorry to break it to you, but your desire to have your girlfriend to yourself has to go on the back burner for a while. These women need to get through their grief. That doesn\u2019t work on a calendar, it just had to be endured and worked through. \n\nYour part as Erica\u2019s boyfriend is to be supportive.

If she starts volunteering somewhere, that's an automatic few hours free for a solo date with Erica.\n\nI do feel the \"And even if I were his girlfriend...\" comment needs to be addressed, because that is pinging some not-good things, such as she has become possessive or attached with you, or is envious, or maybe caught feelings.", "Nta this is weird. Are you paying for her too?", "NTA , While I\u2019m sure they\u2019re both completely broken, she should get help if this is ongoing . Does she take her with her to her job? I doubt it.

Going for a walk or at least walk to the location of the date ?", "Look dude, you can want or not want anything, that's your right.  But take a step back and really think here. Imagine you're 18 again, on the edge of starting life...and both of your parents died. Emotionally, financially, and logistically, your life is fucked before it starts.  It's like the floor dropped out from under you at the worst possible moment. \n\nSo yeah, you would cling to your sibling with everything you have.  Failing to understand that shows that you aren't any more mature than the 18 year old you don't want around. \n\nIf you cant deal or just don't like your gf enough to work through this, just dump her and move on. But if you see a future with her, put on your big boy pants and realize that she's dealing with something more important than you and try to help. \n\nNo judgement.  Just figure out what you want and do it. Stop telling other people how to deal with grief.", "[deleted]", "So your friend can make jokes but as soon as hanna dishes it back its an issue?

Why should you care about what others think? You are HER BF. Show some empathy.", "NAH this isn\u2019t assholish just a bit strange but understandable given their trauma, it\u2019s a sad situation. Why does she have to be near you guys on your date? She could sit at another table or maybe even meet a friend there so you have space to talk. It is very odd for someone to tag along on dates like that", "NAH  \nHannah needs therapy. Your girlfriend should see that and should help Hannah find other ways to cope instead of imposing her on your whole relationship.", "NAH\n\nI get your side. I truly do. But you are not #1 right now. Hannah and Erica went through a tragedy and that comes before you right now. If you aren't able to cope with that for a while and support your gf through this tough time maybe you bow out.

Erica will judge you by how you treat Hannah.", "A year ago.", "Right? Seems like OP intentionally omitted that.", "The friend was just cracking a daft joke, presumably having no idea\n\nIt was insensitive but almost certainly entirely accidental", "Yeah, I\u2019ve heard men make this joke before and it\u2019s never funny. \n\nTelling him it was none of his business was just Hannah\u2019s comeback because she\u2019s 18, didn\u2019t have a better comeback ready, and was made uncomfortable by what he said. \n\nBecause really an adult man cannot be out with a woman in a context that is not somehow sexual or romantic? The friend sounds like a dick.", "I agree with most everything you wrote expect that it's not of his friend business. Hannah was rude. And if she does not want people to think she is OP's girlfriend she should not tag along. \n\nAlthough I do not judge her for this attachment with her sister, she should take more lighty if people joke. And it wasn't a gross joke. I only wish more guys call out their male friends when they are dating much younger women.", "I would say that a year of tagging along to dates *is* Grace. Hannah needs to work on her ptsd/mental health now. She\u2019s an adult. What else is she going to do, follow her sister forever? To work? To the bedroom?

Who are you to decide what is normal behaviour or not after such a tragic loss? Also, she is only 18.\n\n> And she is very much out of line for saying what she did \n\nYou can't be serious.

Fuck you.", "What would that have to do with anything?\n\nHis joke was rude full stop.", "18 is not a minor.", "She is literally not a minor at 18.she is literally an adult. And the friend could have just not said anything.

Sad.  \n\n\nA man not able to understand that his GF needs support and her sister needs support right now?   \nSeriously pathetic.    \n\n\nWe aren't born knowing how to support people who are going through a lot, but we can learn.  Now is a great time to learn.  Trained professionals are standing by!", "A year is not a long time. Wtf? Do you even understand what a horrible thing she went though?", "time and place though. Plus its a bit weird defending his friend so hard after saying something so stupid as opposed to you know, your SO's sister who recently lost her parents at a young age.\n\nYeah, she probably needs therapy, but blowing up on her like that isn't productive at all either", "OP is 30 years old. This is a grown ass adult. They\u2019re selfish, unempathetic, and maybe should be more focused on having the sister in grief couseling.\n\nDid he ever think that maybe his girlfriend wants her sister around because *she* also lost her parents?", "1 year ago. I take it you've never lost someone close to you. After one year you are just beginning to really understand & grapple with the loss. \n\nOr you know, before sending the sister off for therapy he could have a conversation with his gf because really this is up to her. If she's OK with it then he needs to decide if he can live with it. If not, he can keep it moving & find a gf who hasn't recently experienced something deeply traumatic.", "I think you\u2019re being a bit quick there to throw the blame onto the person hurting here.

And we don\u2019t know if her sister was in the car, she\u2019s having nightmares, that\u2019s making me think she was, though I could be wrong. The first few years after losing our Mom, my siblings and I clung to each other. Most people understood that.

He doesn\u2019t have to deal with any of it", "I dunno one man telling another a woman is too young for him is a step in the right direction, even if said in a joking manner.

Obv not by having the sister come with them everywhere, but does have to deal with the trauma.", "It was a dumb way to do it is what they\u2019re saying. Sure you can be frustrated and address it later, privately, without the little sister there. But snapping back at an 18 year old who had snapped back at your friend for saying you\u2019re fucking both her and her sister? OP did wrong.", "He of course can have his frustrations and such. I know I would, but he obviously has to deal with it if it\u2019s something gf is willingly doing.  \n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s a bit of an oversight to not have had some conversation with his gf about it all and jump straight to telling off the sister in the moment.", "You're right. He can be single if he's incapable of understanding that a child needs support after losing BOTH PARENTS AT 17! What the actual fuck?!?", "Because it sexualizes the young woman, from his perspective, could still be a minor. (And barely legal) And despite her age, it's normal for women to not want to be sexualize by a someone, let alone a complete stranger. And he had to jump to that thinking/sorta joke. There are sooooo many other reasons (and jokes) for why she's with him, and he had to go with *that?* Lost me on that one. People are allowed to be offended by someone for what they say about them. Why does she have to understand it's a joke?", "Its a normal joke used the wrong way. Its supposed to be said to an older couple saying that their SO look young for their age, as a compliment. And a small dig at the one you are saying it to, presumably the one you know. You dont tell a joke at the expense of someone you dont know....\n\nIts not meant to be used for two girls just sitting with a guy. One looking young and the other looking somewhat the same age as him (assuming). It was a odd time to pull out that \"joke\"", "something being 'normal' doesnt exempt it from being gross. \n\nit was a gross joke.", "Normal doesn't mean it wasn't gross", "Nooo it\u2019s a pretty gross thing to say.", "If I were around half of these people who use reddit, I swear my ankles would be so swole from tip toeing around the shattered glass that is their backbone.

Or there partners and friends are shocked when the ops state they have feelings and opinions that matter too", "get a grip whats gross about the joke?", "It wasnt gross either get a grip", "How is it gross to make a playful implication that your friend is on two dates at once? Redditors are too sensitive man.", "I have to ask, which is more gross, the joke about a late twenty something dating an 18 year old, or the possibility that he was dating a younger woman? Because I'm pretty sure it would be way worse if he was actually dating someone so young and nobody had the stomach to call him on it. \nMaybe reddit is just a little full of people fantasizing about people too young for them, but I am genuinely shocked at how many people are coming after the friend for what he said.\n\nOP is very much TAH here. What he wants isn't the issue, but it seems like of all the people involved in the joke telling it was OP who got the most offended. He needs to grow up and learn how to have conversations at the right time in the right manner.", "100% true. It\u2019s so weird that they think that this joke was so horrible. The people in this sub are so terminally online, which is ironic because this sub is supposed to be for judging real life situations.

Just seems like people are looking to get upset about anything and everything. First world problems, lol", "I've been through a lot of adversity and I still think that the joke is inappropriate. It's uncomfortable for Hannah considering she is a teenager and he walks in and makes a weird comment about her being on a date with someone so much older who is also her sister's boyfriend (he didn't know that but still). I would have felt weird about that at 18 as well.", "Yeah, and 30 year olds are *way* too old for 18 year olds. That's the point.", "Exactly. If the dude really cares for his girlfriend then he\u2019ll do what he can to help her and her sister through the loss of the parents.", "First of all, what's normal about joking about who is dating who? Even if either one of them was the date, it's not appropriate to openly tease that OP is dating both of them. \n\nSecond, it's gross(ly inappropriate) to point out an age difference out loud for anyone to hear.
