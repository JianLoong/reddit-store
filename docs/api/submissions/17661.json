This whole, \u201cyour money is our money, but my money is mine\u201d always leads to issues, especially when you\u2019ve been earning extra quietly on the side and are now dropping this on him as a done deal. What are your finances like otherwise? Why did you earn this money without telling him, only to bring it up  as an extra vacation? Waaaaaay too much you\u2019re not saying here, and it sure seems like you\u2019re working the Reddit triggers (you do all the work at home, he\u2019s being petty about wanting an equal break for himself) to get folks on your side", "NTA -- OMG, as soon as he indicated he didn't want you to \"dump the kid\" on him, I would have been out the door for a week and just let him figure everything out all on his own.  Outside the actual monetary income, you are bringing a lot more VALUE to the table -- health benefits alone are a HUGE cost abatement! \n\nThis is one of those cases where \"Hire a nanny, housekeeper, cook, etc. calculation\" could be made to show that his $3k additional income pales in comparison to your non-monetary value added to the marriage.\n\nIf you are setting aside \"side-hustle and plasma donation\" money you are making for the express purpose of going on a girls trip, that shouldn't even remotely factor into the \"household\" budget, or the family trips.\n\nHe's being incredibly selfish to tell you that you cannot earn your own money and travel independently.

I\u2019ve been doing an annual (minus Covid) girls trip with the same friends since 1986. I got married in 1989 after establishing that these trips were nonnegotiable.

He sounds like one of those guys who does not want to care for his own child.", "So I hate to break it to you but when you sign up for kids you suspend the idea of being able to travel whenever you want, especially since you already go on so many trips a year, I don\u2019t think your super wrong for wanting to go on a girlfriends trip but if your excuse is that you\u2019ve loved travelling even before meeting him then YTA, having kids is an equal contribution effort, and you saying that it\u2019s not smart for him to spend 700$ and only for you to do so then how is that fair at all?

At that age they likely won't even understand why you left and may blame themselves.\n\nTo add to that if you're unhappy about doing so much work around the house, you need to talk to your husband about it, not use it as leverage to get what you want, marriage is a team sport.\n\nParenting is a full time job with no holidays.", "YTA.... So you want a mommy break and a girls trip? what about your husband....does he get to take extra trips just for him and his buddies....are you OK with now funding two separate trips given the money involved?  OP's a bit selfish here.", "YTA - Please don't tell me you're funding your extras by donating (ie selling) plasma. \n\nIf this is the case, your husband is 100% correct. You do not have extra money to be spending on things like holidays.", "Selling blood to fund a vacation is a bad idea and very bad picture overall.\nYTA", "NTA - let him $700 on something too if ya'll can afford it.

Especially him not considering the childcare and household load that you carry above his share.

So anything you make , even if its a side hustle or hustles is joint money.  Instead of making the money and discussing it after the fact, it should have been a discussion of what do you think about XYZ.  Also, why are you letting him get away with not carrying his fair share of the house load.  Husband for claiming money is the issue when its really he doesnt want to do the work while you are gone and not sharing in the work.  You both need to sit down and reallocate responsibilities and discuss individual spending", "NTA, but your husband sure sounds like one.

Bet it's LOADS less than $700.", "NTA absolutely  \n\n\nYou definetly need a break, because you are working AND taking care of a child AND taking care of a home. That must be very exhausting both physically and mentally.  \nIt sounds like he is just scared to be left alone with all the house work and a baby and doesn't know how to navigate that. Maybe it's time for him to be more involved in a chores and care for HIS baby. \n\nTalk it out and maybe consider him also spending some money on a mini trip or an interest he has, I'm sure there is a way to budget that.", "NTA. As someone who has raised my kid and been married for 20 years, a girls trip is not a weird thing or something your husband should really even care about, in my opinion. I know not your question, but I feel like the tit for tat financial thing a lot of couples talk about here on reddit seems very unhealthy. It's not really great for a relationship to always be keeping track of every cent one person makes over the other. Plus you've set up an avenue for income specifically for this purpose. If it's not taking away from your household finances for necessities then I don't see the issue with a bit of time away with friends. Often that can actually strengthen your relationship with your partner because it fills up your mental and emotional bank.", "I might be the minority, but NTA. It\u2019s important that you also get to do the things you enjoy. You\u2019re working, homemaking, child raising. Take some time to enjoy yourself. \nAlso- \u201cyou spend $700, so I get to spend $700\u201d is very childish. I hope it works out for you, OP", "NTA, you're covering your costs by doing additional work to pay for it on top of everything else you do - if you were just taking it out of the combined bank account this would be a different story. if he wants $700 to do something with he can go start his own side hustle outside of work and earn it himself. Parents are allowed breaks outside of their immediate family, you should be allowed to spend time with your friends doing the normal things you would previously. He needs to see that this division is not equal, and not sustainable for you. go on the trip and let him see how much you do when he has to take care of his child and home for a few days", "NTA but you both need to come to an arrangement. Just because you earn trip money doesn\u2019t mean he gets to spend an equivalent amount and that sort of attitude will cause major problems. So does his take that you\u2019re \u201cdumping\u201d his child on him. \n\nIt\u2019s scary to think about being responsible for something you\u2019re not usually responsible for while your partner is off \u201chaving fun\u201d. No one want to get stuck with the perceived drudgery of home/childcare instead of being off having fun. \n\nYou two need to work out what is reasonable.", "NTA. The money you would be spending is side money you earned separately from your paycheck, it's not money coming out of your joint/household account so his argument doesn't hold water. I think he's probably more concerned about the childcare aspect of it more than the financial one. And, btw, he's not your child's babysitter, he's her FATHER. Parenting is 50/50, she's half his kid. He needs to step up and take care of his half. He may also be jealous of you going off with your friends unaccompanied. You'll need to sit him down and calmly talk about this. But it may be tough if he doesn't acquiesce. Marriage is a partnership and sometimes you have to give things up that you enjoyed as a single, or at least put them on the back burner for a while. It may take some time before he's comfortable doing time apart. And I'm sure there are things he used to enjoy doing as a singe that he had to give up or put on the back burner too. Talk to him.", "NTA.  A $700 getaway with your friends couldn't be all that extravagant or lengthy and, it sounds like, would be a good mental health breakaway for you.  Maybe there is something your husband would like to do that he should think of and allow too, not even necessarily requiring a side hustle to do.  The bigger concern I have here is what it will feel like to you to be \"forbidden\" to go.  That feels too restrictive to me and too much like a parent/child connection.  You're both adults and this is important to you.  Marriages require all kinds of adjustments and this is one I hope you can work out so that you are both happy.  \n\nLikewise, many see money as power and that might be concerning.  Personally, money in a marriage is best shared.  My husband typically made more money than me but it was always \"our\" money and he never treated me as less because I had less earning capacity.  We pooled everything and both had equal access to the funds.  Of course we were both reasonable people and did not abuse this communal money.  BUT, I never felt it was a \"his/mine\" situation.  We were a team and he appreciated the many ways I contributed that did not have compensation attached to it.  I think you might have some deeper, more serious issues to work on in your marriage other than this power play over whether it is okay to take time for a vacation with your friends as you did before you married.", "Grow up! Your a parent now.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nEveryone deserves a break. Both of you are working AND you are doing more at home than he contributes.

As long as you are okay with him planning his own occasional trips then this should be a non-issue.

I agree that if she gets to do something fun he should also get to do something he enjoys but not in the context of an even exchange dollar for dollar. He shouldn\u2019t be looking to spend $700 just because her trip will cost $700, he should be looking to find something he enjoys to do.

She makes extra on the side - so it's her money that she can spend as she pleases\n\nwhat if he gets a raise? or a bonus? or maybe he works overtime? or maybe he can quit, get a lower paying job, so he could have time for side hustles?", "INFO would you be OK with him taking the extra $3K he makes and putting it in a personal account for \"fun money\"?", "Gotcha, ultimately I think this boils down to a miscommunication about fun funds and how to top up those funds. Just because you're able to sell blood and have a side hustle that works alongside your household responsibilities and career, doesn't necessarily mean its the same for your husband. \n\nI don't think you're an AH, but I do think you guys need to re-align.", "how do your jobs compare in terms of hours, complexity and stress levels?", "INFO \n\nHow long are you planning to take your holiday for?", "You two need to start both having dinner money that is just yours too spend. You are both being to controlling about the money and that's not good.", "I agree with this, but using your logic, maybe he spends more than $700, maybe a $1000.   Also he should get equal time.  They also need to work on equitably sharing housework and childcare.", "The first sentence here is wrong, no-one is saying she has to transform her entire personality. What we're saying is she has to make sacrifices and her life will never be the same as it was before kids. There are unlimited hobbies that don't require leaving for days/weeks at a time.\n\nBut she seems hyper focused on this one activity because \"that's what she did before kids\" and imo it's not really feasible.", "I kind of addressed this in my initial comment big dog", "Yeah we definitely need more info on how long the trips are, I feel like if it were just a weekend she would've used the word getaway or weekend getaway though. Which I 100 percent support.", "Saying travelling implies it's for a fair while, so unless she deliberately didn't use the word vacation because it makes her sound worse, I'd assume it's for over a week.", "the most real answer here\n\nOP is resenting the fact that she does more around the house and not afraid to throw it in her husband's face if it can win her some \"fun time with the girls\"\n\nthe point of being married and having kids is so that your priorities would shift to being married and having kids. If you just try to fit your \"real\" life around the \"inconvenience\" of a family - you are on your way out", "Travelling itch is also not a life necessity.", "There's no such thing as \"Additional money\" in marriage..... What you each earn is marital money.", "because her extra income is _their_ extra income and it doesn't sound like frivolous trips should be their priority at this point", "I'm not saying they should HIRE a nany/housekeeper. I'm saying OP needs to show the value of all the things she does that husband does not because $$ is not the only thing with value in life. So husband saying, \"I make more money\" isn't a good argument if he isn't contributing other things to the household as well.", "I\u2019ve met a lot of people who would say OP shouldn\u2019t go anywhere without her husband. But I completely agree!!! Childish and a total jerk for this.", "The issue is: That's planned family income. Also, he would earn way less if OP didn't have his back and do most of the work at home. I am also not buying that this is about money. It sounds more like he doesn't want to be alone with his kid because he knows he's incompetent.", "That's ok but she earned money to not burden the family budget. He can do the same. And maybe, this whole trip would be much less of a discussion if he was more involved.", "She IS and HAS BEEN making sacrifices. After three years of having a child in five years of being married, I\u2019m pretty sure at this point she understands that life is not going to be exactly like it was before. The way I read it, she\u2019s not asking for regularly scheduled girls trips, she\u2019s saving and planning for one she would like to take considering she hasn\u2019t been able to do something like that and 3+ years. It\u2019s not unreasonable to want to take a trip without your family. Especially when you are the one doing 75% of the workload at home in addition to your full-time job. That in my opinion is a huge issue and they really need to communicate and work towards a more equitable home life balance.", "Since when? I say travelling interchangeable with vacation. Traveling could be anywhere from 4 days to a week to 2 weeks to a month. I highly doubt OP plans to be gone for longer than a week or so but obviously I could be wrong", "Exactly, I know people like this, the reason her husband wouldn't know what bills to pay is because she hordes that knowledge like a hermit.  You go on 3-4 vacations a year, and you still need to go out with the girls.  The stuff she wrote about all she does and how he doesn't do shit but she's okay taking off and leaving the kids with an incompetent person that doesn't add up.  \n\nI have found that on some of these that are written, so one-sided that they describe their SO as being so messed up that it would CA to leave the kids with them but the one posting wants to go on a 2-3 girls/boys trip.", "To you.\nNot to everyone", "That\u2019s not how it works for every couple. My husband and I pool together a certain amount for shared expenses. Anything additional we do with what we please.", "That\u2019s not how all households work. A lot of families keep separate finances. She isn\u2019t obligated to share the money she made from donating on her own time.", "But if all of his income is \"family income\" then all of her income is \"family income\".  I do agree this sounds like it's more about him not wanting to be home alone with his kids.   Maybe he could take $700 from his salary and use it to pay for some childcare while his wife goes on her trip.", "You read it wrong then lol she pretty clearly says trips (plural). \n\nI don't think so, she seems to think after the kid's a certain age her life's going to go back to how it was before (that's the way I understood it anyway). \n\nYes but she should be discussing it with him if she's unhappy that he's not doing his fair share of work. Not essentially using it as straight up blackmail to get what she wants.\n\nTo me it sounds like she's been doing extra work at home so she could hold it over him when she inevitably wanted to start taking girls trips again.", "Yeah I personally classify anything over overnight in a place that\u2019s not your home as a \u201ctrip\u201d. Also if you go somewhere that\u2019s over an hour from your home. That\u2019s a trip. Could be a day trip or a weekend trip or a week long trip! OP could be asking for a weekend with her friends or two weeks, we don\u2019t know which.", "Yeah true we could both be wrong tbf, probs should ask for INFO.\n\nIn Australia we generally use travelling for actual travelling (like months) and holiday if you're just going for anything shorter than that.", "oh yeah, this sub famously loves the \"mental load\" arguments, where one spouse is so inadequate that they wouldn't know how to put on pants without the other spouse telling them\n\nit definitely exists, but much more often it's just a manipulation technique in order to gain an upper hand in the relationships - you are frying eggs the wrong way, but I won't tell you how, I'm just going to use it to criticize you and then take it over and complain about it", "Lol what? no it's pretty objectively just not? Is this the hill you really want to die on?", "That would be reasonable, I think. A bit pathetic but reasonable.", "She\u2019s already doing the majority of childcare and housework. It\u2019s ok for her to get a break. Having a child doesn\u2019t end your life. He should make extra money to do fun things for himself too. I don\u2019t see a problem with that. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s taking from joint funds.", "There's a difference between saying you're going travelling and saying you're going on a trip though, you wouldn't say I'm going travelling for a a weekend would you?", "There\u2019s no \u201cobjective \u201c here. Some need more sleep, some less, some need quiet time, some not, some people need more out of location experience", "I've already addressed the childcare point a few times so I'm not going to do it again. \n\nNo-ones asking her to end her life, but to me she seems to think she can keep living it as she did before kids. \n\nHE ALREADY DOES MAKE EXTRA MONEY. I don't get the mental gymnastics you are all doing that she makes money on the side - it's hers for some reason, but he makes extra money over all - it's both of theirs and \"for the family\". How does that make any sense?", "I mean, I don\u2019t really use the word traveling at all to be honest. What I\u2019m getting at is that everyone has a slightly different definition of these words and we don\u2019t know what OP means because she didn\u2019t clarify. \n\nI think OP should have the opportunity to go on a trip or travel with her friends at least once a year. But she and her husband have to figure out between them the finances. I honestly think they could cut out one of the 3 family vacations they take and split that money for whatever they each want to do.", "Did you just really compare needing sleep to flying overseas?", "You\u2019re assuming how they split their money. She\u2019s already said if he made extra money she wouldn\u2019t feel entitled to it. If they have an agreed amount that is shared money to cover shared expenses, additional money from either of them shouldn\u2019t impact that.", "Yeah I think the slight nuances in vocabulary here is the real issue here haha, but I also think she deliberately didn't specify how long she was going for because she knows she's in the wrong.", "Yes.\nAbsolutely.", "Yeah there is wayyy too much info missing from the OP, does the fact that she's been making extra money on the side without disclosing to him what she intended it to be for not seem like a bit of a red flag to you though?\n\nAlso to echo another comment, hypothetically if he gets a bonus at work, is that considered extra money and just his? A lot of ambiguity here."]}
