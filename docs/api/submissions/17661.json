This whole, \u201cyour money is our money, but my money is mine\u201d always leads to issues, especially when you\u2019ve been earning extra quietly on the side and are now dropping this on him as a done deal. What are your finances like otherwise? Why did you earn this money without telling him, only to bring it up  as an extra vacation? Waaaaaay too much you\u2019re not saying here, and it sure seems like you\u2019re working the Reddit triggers (you do all the work at home, he\u2019s being petty about wanting an equal break for himself) to get folks on your side", "NTA -- OMG, as soon as he indicated he didn't want you to \"dump the kid\" on him, I would have been out the door for a week and just let him figure everything out all on his own.  Outside the actual monetary income, you are bringing a lot more VALUE to the table -- health benefits alone are a HUGE cost abatement! \n\nThis is one of those cases where \"Hire a nanny, housekeeper, cook, etc. calculation\" could be made to show that his $3k additional income pales in comparison to your non-monetary value added to the marriage.\n\nIf you are setting aside \"side-hustle and plasma donation\" money you are making for the express purpose of going on a girls trip, that shouldn't even remotely factor into the \"household\" budget, or the family trips.\n\nHe's being incredibly selfish to tell you that you cannot earn your own money and travel independently.

At that age they likely won't even understand why you left and may blame themselves.\n\nTo add to that if you're unhappy about doing so much work around the house, you need to talk to your husband about it, not use it as leverage to get what you want, marriage is a team sport.\n\nParenting is a full time job with no holidays.", "YTA.... So you want a mommy break and a girls trip? what about your husband....does he get to take extra trips just for him and his buddies....are you OK with now funding two separate trips given the money involved?  OP's a bit selfish here.", "YTA - Please don't tell me you're funding your extras by donating (ie selling) plasma. \n\nIf this is the case, your husband is 100% correct.

Especially him not considering the childcare and household load that you carry above his share.

So anything you make , even if its a side hustle or hustles is joint money.  Instead of making the money and discussing it after the fact, it should have been a discussion of what do you think about XYZ.  Also, why are you letting him get away with not carrying his fair share of the house load.  Husband for claiming money is the issue when its really he doesnt want to do the work while you are gone and not sharing in the work.  You both need to sit down and reallocate responsibilities and discuss individual spending", "NTA, but your husband sure sounds like one.

Bet it's LOADS less than $700.", "NTA absolutely  \n\n\nYou definetly need a break, because you are working AND taking care of a child AND taking care of a home. That must be very exhausting both physically and mentally.  \nIt sounds like he is just scared to be left alone with all the house work and a baby and doesn't know how to navigate that. Maybe it's time for him to be more involved in a chores and care for HIS baby. \n\nTalk it out and maybe consider him also spending some money on a mini trip or an interest he has, I'm sure there is a way to budget that.", "NTA. As someone who has raised my kid and been married for 20 years, a girls trip is not a weird thing or something your husband should really even care about, in my opinion. I know not your question, but I feel like the tit for tat financial thing a lot of couples talk about here on reddit seems very unhealthy. It's not really great for a relationship to always be keeping track of every cent one person makes over the other. Plus you've set up an avenue for income specifically for this purpose. If it's not taking away from your household finances for necessities then I don't see the issue with a bit of time away with friends. Often that can actually strengthen your relationship with your partner because it fills up your mental and emotional bank.", "I might be the minority, but NTA. It\u2019s important that you also get to do the things you enjoy. You\u2019re working, homemaking, child raising. Take some time to enjoy yourself. \nAlso- \u201cyou spend $700, so I get to spend $700\u201d is very childish. I hope it works out for you, OP", "NTA, you're covering your costs by doing additional work to pay for it on top of everything else you do - if you were just taking it out of the combined bank account this would be a different story. if he wants $700 to do something with he can go start his own side hustle outside of work and earn it himself. Parents are allowed breaks outside of their immediate family, you should be allowed to spend time with your friends doing the normal things you would previously. He needs to see that this division is not equal, and not sustainable for you. go on the trip and let him see how much you do when he has to take care of his child and home for a few days", "NTA but you both need to come to an arrangement. Just because you earn trip money doesn\u2019t mean he gets to spend an equivalent amount and that sort of attitude will cause major problems. So does his take that you\u2019re \u201cdumping\u201d his child on him. \n\nIt\u2019s scary to think about being responsible for something you\u2019re not usually responsible for while your partner is off \u201chaving fun\u201d. No one want to get stuck with the perceived drudgery of home/childcare instead of being off having fun. \n\nYou two need to work out what is reasonable.", "NTA. The money you would be spending is side money you earned separately from your paycheck, it's not money coming out of your joint/household account so his argument doesn't hold water. I think he's probably more concerned about the childcare aspect of it more than the financial one. And, btw, he's not your child's babysitter, he's her FATHER. Parenting is 50/50, she's half his kid. He needs to step up and take care of his half. He may also be jealous of you going off with your friends unaccompanied. You'll need to sit him down and calmly talk about this. But it may be tough if he doesn't acquiesce. Marriage is a partnership and sometimes you have to give things up that you enjoyed as a single, or at least put them on the back burner for a while. It may take some time before he's comfortable doing time apart. And I'm sure there are things he used to enjoy doing as a singe that he had to give up or put on the back burner too. Talk to him.", "NTA.  A $700 getaway with your friends couldn't be all that extravagant or lengthy and, it sounds like, would be a good mental health breakaway for you.  Maybe there is something your husband would like to do that he should think of and allow too, not even necessarily requiring a side hustle to do.  The bigger concern I have here is what it will feel like to you to be \"forbidden\" to go.  That feels too restrictive to me and too much like a parent/child connection.  You're both adults and this is important to you.  Marriages require all kinds of adjustments and this is one I hope you can work out so that you are both happy.  \n\nLikewise, many see money as power and that might be concerning.  Personally, money in a marriage is best shared.  My husband typically made more money than me but it was always \"our\" money and he never treated me as less because I had less earning capacity.  We pooled everything and both had equal access to the funds.  Of course we were both reasonable people and did not abuse this communal money.  BUT, I never felt it was a \"his/mine\" situation.  We were a team and he appreciated the many ways I contributed that did not have compensation attached to it.  I think you might have some deeper, more serious issues to work on in your marriage other than this power play over whether it is okay to take time for a vacation with your friends as you did before you married.", "Grow up! Your a parent now.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nEveryone deserves a break. Both of you are working AND you are doing more at home than he contributes.

As long as you are okay with him planning his own occasional trips then this should be a non-issue.

I agree that if she gets to do something fun he should also get to do something he enjoys but not in the context of an even exchange dollar for dollar.

Time is money, so that time is time away from family or time away from things that need to get done with the house and kids. I understand the point about him not pulling his fair share around the house, which is a separate discussion to be had. He makes more, but are your jobs the same in the number of hours worked? It's a difficult discussion because there are so many factors, but regardless of his personal spending, it's a reasonable argument that you are both making nearly the same after your side hustles, so IS it fair that you get an extra $700 to spend when he will just have to fit his personal spending into your regular, shared budget? On the surface, it seems like there is a lot going on here, so it's not a cut and dry answer for me. If all of this was discussed ahead of time about earning extra income for personal spending as to not impact the regular budget, then NTA. If you have been doing this on the side to have a hidden savings and now you want to use it, then YTA.
