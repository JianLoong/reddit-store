She asked my husband how much he paid for our house, my stepdad how much money he made in his previous job, how much my watch cost. She even googled one of our art pieces to see how much it sold for and started talking about how crazy it was that we spent that much, which frankly was very uncomfortable. My stepdad pulled my brother aside and asked if there was a problem, but my brother just said it was normal for her to do that but he did say he\u2019d speak to her about it. \n\nOn Christmas morning we all gathered round to open presents and thankfully, Lindsay didn\u2019t say anything untoward, so I figured James had spoken to her about her intrusive questions.

They know. Whether you grew up with money or not, common sense is required, unless she's on the spectrum (which is the common excuse the Y T A & E S H people are giving). But come on, people here always get defensive when someone posts here and is from a wealthier background, constantly making excuses. If this was reversed would you guys be okay with it? If she googled how much a pair of socks or how much an old TV was and passed comment. If she went on about how little the family spent, and then declared at Xmas morning \"oh you guys should have loads of money in January since you spent so little during Christmas.\" would you all be making the same comments? I doubt it. You'd be up in arms and calling her a snob", "All of these E-S-H and Y-T-A replies are dumbfounding lol. Have any of you people ever had an interaction with an actual human being. In what world is asking people about how much money they make and adding up the totals of Christmas gifts normal? NTA.

I could see maybe one or two off handed comments, but to fixate on money so much that you tally up how much money was spent on Christmas presents and then announce it to the whole family??? \n\nDon\u2019t apologize to your brother. Why should you? His girlfriend came into your house for Christmas and immediately started questioning you about money and practically appraising everything in your house! She should be apologizing to you, and your brother should be apologizing on her behalf.\n\nIf someone is rude to you you\u2019re allowed to defend yourself and shut them down which is what you did. Maybe next time she\u2019ll learn to keep her mouth shut and not constantly talk about money.", "NTA\n\nThe gf was incredibly rude and crass, I would have said something to her too", "NTA. I realize there may be more benign explanations for Lindsay's questions (maybe there is a cultural difference, maybe there is some neurodivergence). BUT your family had made an attempt to address it privately, and adding up the amount gifts cost takes some forethought, it wasn't an offhand comment she just blurted out. Plus, you have this bit:\n\n>Lindsay loudly said **she didn\u2019t know how we could afford to do anything in January** as she added up the total we\u2019d spent on gifts\n\nThat's judgey. However well-to-do OP may or may not be is irrelevant; \"I don't know how you can afford that\" is a rude comment at any income level. What was she hoping to accomplish with that question? \"Oh, you're right, brother's gf of less than a year! Let me redo my whole finances!\"", "NTA. She came into your house and basically started appraising your net worth of assets like your about to go to auction\u2026. are you sure she\u2019s not planning a NYE heist???\n\nSeriously though, your brother had the gall to ring you up and say you upset her, when she\u2019s the one asking intrusive financial questions and itemizing your belongings. If I were you, she would not be getting an invite back. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis is wild. \n\nI'm someone who strongly believes the stigma against talking about money is bullshit and mostly just serves to do harm. Everyone should be comfortable talking about how much money they make and be ok talking about what things cost. It would help prevent people from being taken advantage of. And even I think she went way too far. \n\nEven if she has some compulsion to know how much things are, or prepare for next year by knowing how much you guys typically spend, she should at least have the courtesy to keep it to herself.", "NTA.. seriously who does what she did?? Imagine if she did that with poor people. Good lord no sane adult would do what she did and I'm shocked so many people think what she did was acceptable. Since you talked to the brother and he didn't talk to her, I think you had every right to call her out on her shit. Who fucking cares what a family spends on eachother? Don't give me the \"oh she probably comes from a poor family\" excuse either.

There was no need to make all of those financial comments and questions. I have no idea what world people live in that are responding that this behavior is acceptable.", "Uhhh NTA? How strange. I can't tell if she's bitter about not having the money you guys do, or if she's planning a Home Alone style break-in. Maybe your brother didn't talk to her about it like he said he would, so she was a little blindsided, but you'd think she would know better in the first place...", "NTA. If she makes public pronouncements, she should expect a public response.", "NTA.  Your brother said he\u2019d speak with her.  Not sure if he did but either he did not or he did and she just kept going anyway.  Her comments and questions are tasteless, crass and judgmental.  It maybe normal for her but your brother already knew that people found it distasteful.  You could have been more polite and not dropped the gold digger comment but it did do the job of shutting her up.  Please tell your brother it\u2019s him that owe you and your family apologies.", "Lindsay sounds like she is setting you all up to be robbed.

And you don\u2019t owe her nor him Nada.", "NTA - whether gold digger is the correct term or not, perhaps it was used in the heat of the moment, you are not in the wrong here. What she did was tacky and bizarre.", "NTA. Who even does that? How rude could your brothers gf be. I\u2019m sorry but everyone knows it\u2019s rude to ask about the cost of things. What your brothers gf was rude, more rude then your comment.", "NTA.  Some people need a public smack down.", "NTA. Everyone knows it's rude to question people about money and how expensive stuff is. (Unless it's a new car. For some reason that's ok). And she is d enough to know better. My son asked a friend of mine who was very wealthy a bunch of questions like that once. But he was five.  I told him to stop and it was rude...", "I don't geht esh to me it is an obvious NTA bc beg your pardon you are meeting people for the first time and you are googling the value of stuff and have the audacity to proclaim this in front of the group and be insulted for getting backlash? \n\nshe spoke in front of everyone and so did you, the only part is your brother should have told her to be quiet even if he knew about her googling the value. \n\nCommon table manners were totally lacking on what is appropriate conversationally.", "NTA at all- confused by all the opposing votes. It is very rude to ask people the cost of things, their salary etc, never mind tally up the cost of gifts and then comment on how much others are spending. If she were to do this to her BF later, perhaps to say how shocking their spending was, OK that is one thing... But to apparently incessantly comment on it is creepy and to me a huge red flag.", "NTA.\n\nYou were not out of line. Lindsay was\u2014 right from the beginning.

She was way out of line and inappropriate. Why do you need to speak to her privately when she is the one who announced the gift total in front of everyone? You publicly responded to her public misbehavior. \n\nYour brother is delusional if he thinks they deserve an apology. She is feeling shame due to her inappropriate behavior - a feeling that exists for this very reason!! Her best course of action would be to learn from it not expect people to baby her for being rude.", "NTA", "one word for your brother:   PRENUP\n\nNTA", "My paternal grandmother who I dearly loved did that.

It is very crass to point out how much everything cost. Very.", "NTA. She was in the wrong completely. I will say this about her, though. It\u2019s possible she comes from a family where money, or lack thereof, was discussed prolifically as she was growing up, hence her curiosity about what things cost. You taught her a valuable lesson, and I hope she learns from it moving forward. \n\nIf it were me, I would not apologize, and I\u2019m definitely someone who apologizes when I need to.", "NTA and I\u2019d never apologize to this human cash register.", "NYA how odd for someone to do that. It's none of her business", "NTA. You actually did her a favor, she should know better than to make comments like that. Its extremely rude. Hopefully next time she\u2019ll think before she speaks.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother is blinded by \"love\", or sex.  So he is going to defend her poor behavior.  You don't owe them an apology.  \n\nNow, that said, if you do think this may be serious, you may choose to give an apology just to not have a whole rift in your family.  But she needs to know she was wrong.", "I think your perception and feelings are valid.\n\nI kind of feel like this is a situation where I would want to meet the person in question to make a judgment. Is she generally kind of socially awkward? Some people have obsessions with things that come off crass but they don't see it or mean it that way. It could be undiagnosed autism as women are generally not diagnosed as often even when they have it.\n\nFor sure you are NTA but she may or may not be depending on her situation.", "Your brother better wear multiple condoms cause Lindsay's going for gold", "Yeah that\u2019s a big NTA for me. It would be one thing if she made one comment, brother talked to her and then that was it\u2026.but to continuously make comments is rude. I don\u2019t think she can blame ignorance either, because this is just basic human civility and manners. My 5 year old knows not to talk about money.  \n\nJust gross behavior\u2026was she raised in a cave?

Meanwhile my friend's family, who spent a few decades living slightly above the poverty line, are much more direct about \"Oh, I just got my 50k bonus this year! And Johnny, he just got a new job, now he makes 145 a year, isn't that great?!\"\n\nSo yeah the girl was being super awkward but possibly not actively malicious.", "I married a man who grew up wealthy but his father left and took all the money with him before we were married. Theres so many things I experienced with their family (as a kid who grew up in a trailer park) that freaked me out, and I told my mother in law about it, mostly in private conversations. I would never tabulate the cost of christmas to the whole table. Thats crazy stuff", "This is what I was thinking. My wife's family from Asia is a little bit like this but they do not want anything from me. I know other people/families from her country that are really bad about asking how much you make/how much things cost and are just socially oblivious to how we behave in America. I say bad about asking but maybe I'm bad about not wanting to say in their eyes. I think there's a distinct difference between being curious/nosey and being greedy though. I didn't see where OP described any behavior that made her look geeedy.", "The only rich people I know who don\u2019t dare to say they aren\u2019t rich are the ones literally listed in Forbes lmao. The others all think they aren\u2019t rich (\u201cwe\u2019re upper middle class \ud83e\udd17\u201d) because they aren\u2019t ALSO listed in Forbes \ud83d\udc80", "Same here.", "Or you are planning an entree. One day OP is listening to his new sister-in-law talk about the exact cost of things in her house, and the next he returns from his vacation only to find the door broken and the remains of what used to be her living room. .", "  I thought she worked in irs.", "I thought that, too, until reading about the 5th or 6th comment/question about money she made. Poor upbringing or not, she has a terrible filter and awful manners. I have a neighbor like that who comments on money and people's weight/body shape\u2014as well as anything personal anyone tells her. The neighborhood avoids her.", "I guess this was probably less of an issue before everyone had instant information at their fingertips all the time to look that kind of thing up. \n\nI\u2019m Korean, and I found the entire situation to be extraordinarily rude. I think this girl doesn\u2019t have a cultural issue; she has a common sense issue. I also grew up pretty poor and my best friend was astoundingly wealthy; it was a topic I NEVER brought up no matter how much better things and situations she had than me because I knew it was extremely rude. \n\nOfc, my nephew is a high school teacher and he says kids now have much less of a traditional sense of manners. (He teaches in rural Wisconsin). Internet is raising people \u2014 the guy on TikTok that singles out people carrying luxury goods and asks them what they do for a living gives those who weren\u2019t taught by someone the sense that we just ask everyone all about their finances and it\u2019s funny.", "I'm Asian and was raised in a Southeast Asian country. My parents and grandparents would have lectured me for being an uneducated low class person if I ever did what this woman did.\nThey would have been ashamed of such behavior.\n\nThis isn't acceptable conduct especially when she is meeting his family.", "This has been wholesome.", "This was her best behaviour. Its all downhill from here.", "Upper lower class as well, I may zillow your house at some point. (Real estate window shopping is my hobby and I have a decent grasp on some markets to guess anyways.) I will still never bring up that I know what you probably paid or what your house is worth because it's fucking rude.", "It\u2019s still inappropriate behaviour", "Eh maybe 10-15 years ago. These days it\u2019s frown upon to ask about someone\u2019s income (I live in SEA country all my life). My mom and my sister don\u2019t even ask the details of my salary; they only know the range. My friends don\u2019t know mine, I don\u2019t know theirs. We just know the possible range from our work industry, position and lifestyle. People who brag about how much money they make are considered as nouveau riche and crash.\n\nEdit: of course some of the old generations might do that; but definitely not those who are below 40 y\u2019o.", "Exactly. And those of us born and raised in poverty know it perfectly."]}
