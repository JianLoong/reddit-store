I was a bit surprised by the question but I just said \u201cmore than I\u2019d like\u201d and moved on. \n\nThroughout the evening she asked several questions centred around money. She asked my husband how much he paid for our house, my stepdad how much money he made in his previous job, how much my watch cost. She even googled one of our art pieces to see how much it sold for and started talking about how crazy it was that we spent that much, which frankly was very uncomfortable. My stepdad pulled my brother aside and asked if there was a problem, but my brother just said it was normal for her to do that but he did say he\u2019d speak to her about it. \n\nOn Christmas morning we all gathered round to open presents and thankfully, Lindsay didn\u2019t say anything untoward, so I figured James had spoken to her about her intrusive questions. However, at lunch, we were talking about plans for January and Lindsay loudly said she didn\u2019t know how we could afford to do anything in January as she added up the total we\u2019d spent on gifts, and then proudly proclaimed the total amount.

He is saying I owe both of them an apology, but I think Lindsay\u2019s behaviour was disgraceful.

They know. Whether you grew up with money or not, common sense is required, unless she's on the spectrum. But come on, people here always get defensive when someone posts here and is from a wealthier background, constantly making excuses. If this was reversed would you guys be okay with it? If she googled how much a pair of socks or how much an old TV was and passed comment. If she went on about how little the family spent, and then declared at Xmas morning \"oh you guys should have loads of money in January since you spent so little during Christmas.\" would you all be making the same comments? I doubt it. You'd be up in arms and calling her a snob", "All of these E-S-H and Y-T-A replies are dumbfounding lol. Have any of you people ever had an interaction with an actual human being. In what world is asking people about how much money they make and adding up the totals of Christmas gifts normal? NTA.

A. Chalkboard. Cringe. \nNTA", "NTA and I really don\u2019t get the y t a\u2019s\n\nIt is so unbelievably rude to make *so many* comments about money. I could see maybe one or two off handed comments, but to fixate on money so much that you tally up how much money was spent on Christmas presents and then announce it to the whole family??? \n\nDon\u2019t apologize to your brother. Why should you? His girlfriend came into your house for Christmas and immediately started questioning you about money and practically appraising everything in your house! She should be apologizing to you, and your brother should be apologizing on her behalf.\n\nIf someone is rude to you you\u2019re allowed to defend yourself and shut them down which is what you did. Maybe next time she\u2019ll learn to keep her mouth shut and not constantly talk about money.", "NTA\n\nThe gf was incredibly rude and crass, I would have said something to her too", "NTA. I realize there may be more benign explanations for Lindsay's questions (maybe there is a cultural difference, maybe there is some neurodivergence). BUT your family had made an attempt to address it privately, and adding up the amount gifts cost takes some forethought, it wasn't an offhand comment she just blurted out. Plus, you have this bit:\n\n>Lindsay loudly said **she didn\u2019t know how we could afford to do anything in January** as she added up the total we\u2019d spent on gifts\n\nThat's judgey. However well-to-do OP may or may not be is irrelevant; \"I don't know how you can afford that\" is a rude comment at any income level. What was she hoping to accomplish with that question? \"Oh, you're right, brother's gf of less than a year! Let me redo my whole finances!\"", "NTA. She came into your house and basically started appraising your net worth of assets like your about to go to auction\u2026. are you sure she\u2019s not planning a NYE heist???\n\nSeriously though, your brother had the gall to ring you up and say you upset her, when she\u2019s the one asking intrusive financial questions and itemizing your belongings. If I were you, she would not be getting an invite back. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis is wild. \n\nI'm someone who strongly believes the stigma against talking about money is bullshit and mostly just serves to do harm. Everyone should be comfortable talking about how much money they make and be ok talking about what things cost. It would help prevent people from being taken advantage of. And even I think she went way too far. \n\nEven if she has some compulsion to know how much things are, or prepare for next year by knowing how much you guys typically spend, she should at least have the courtesy to keep it to herself.", "NTA.. seriously who does what she did?? Imagine if she did that with poor people. Good lord no sane adult would do what she did and I'm shocked so many people think what she did was acceptable. Since you talked to the brother and he didn't talk to her, I think you had every right to call her out on her shit. Who fucking cares what a family spends on eachother? Don't give me the \"oh she probably comes from a poor family\" excuse either. Its a pretty well known unspoken rule to not talk about money so I'm stunned she just had absolutely no fucking clue what she did.", "Almost everyone is saying E S H, but this is a clear cut case of NTA.

Especially people you barely know. Your brother was approached and given the opportunity to try and work on the situation before you said something in front of everyone. You are not in the wrong. \n\nIt is not okay to just ask people about or make comments about their financial situation. Digging to find out what things cost is ridiculous as well. There was no need to make all of those financial comments and questions. I have no idea what world people live in that are responding that this behavior is acceptable.", "Uhhh NTA? How strange. I can't tell if she's bitter about not having the money you guys do, or if she's planning a Home Alone style break-in. Maybe your brother didn't talk to her about it like he said he would, so she was a little blindsided, but you'd think she would know better in the first place...", "NTA. If she makes public pronouncements, she should expect a public response.", "NTA.  Your brother said he\u2019d speak with her.  Not sure if he did but either he did not or he did and she just kept going anyway.  Her comments and questions are tasteless, crass and judgmental.  It maybe normal for her but your brother already knew that people found it distasteful.  You could have been more polite and not dropped the gold digger comment but it did do the job of shutting her up.  Please tell your brother it\u2019s him that owe you and your family apologies.", "Lindsay sounds like she is setting you all up to be robbed. Sheesh she would\u2019ve be allowed to come back to my house. And you don\u2019t owe her nor him Nada.", "NTA - whether gold digger is the correct term or not, perhaps it was used in the heat of the moment, you are not in the wrong here. What she did was tacky and bizarre.", "NTA. Who even does that? How rude could your brothers gf be. I\u2019m sorry but everyone knows it\u2019s rude to ask about the cost of things. What your brothers gf was rude to me, more rude then your comment.", "NTA.  Some people need a public smack down.", "NTA. Everyone knows it's rude to question people about money and how expensive stuff is. (Unless it's a new car. For some reason that's ok). And she is d enough to know better. My son asked a friend of mine who was very wealthy a bunch of questions like that once. But he was five.  I told him to stop and it was rude...", "I don't geht esh to me it is an obvious NTA bc beg your pardon you are meeting people for the first time and you are googling the value of stuff and have the audacity to proclaim this in front of the group and be insulted for getting backlash? \n\nshe spoke in front of everyone and so did you, the only part is your brother should have told her to be quiet even if he knew about her googling the value. \n\nCommon table manners were totally lacking on what is appropriate conversationally.", "NTA at all- confused by all the opposing votes. It is very rude to ask people the cost of things, their salary etc, never mind tally up the cost of gifts and then comment on how much others are spending. If she were to do this to her BF later, perhaps to say how shocking their spending was, OK that is one thing... But to apparently incessantly comment on it is creepy and to me a huge red flag.", "NTA.\n\nYou were not out of line. Lindsay was right from the beginning. I thought it was a concise quip that didn\u2019t burn too much\u2014 and it helped her to get the message, didn\u2019t it? You\u2019re not required to \u201cguide\u201d a guest in your home on proper etiquette. So sorry to your brother who is suffering extreme delusion.", "NTA, and can I come with you on your vacation because according to Lindsay you have the funds to pay for me!!!

She was way out of line and inappropriate. Why do you need to speak to her privately when she is the one who announced the gift total in front of everyone? You publicly responded to her public misbehavior. \n\nYour brother is delusional if he thinks they deserve an apology. She is feeling shame due to her inappropriate behavior - a feeling that exists for this very reason!! Her best course of action would be to learn from it not expect people to baby her for being rude.", "NTA", "one word for your brother:   PRENUP\n\nNTA", "My paternal grandmother who I dearly loved did that. I gave her a pass because she had electric shock therapy that erased years of memory, ergo basically brain damage.", "Clearly nta, she needs to apologize for her behavior and your brother needs to run", "NTA. It is very crass to point out how much everything cost. Very.", "NTA. She was in the wrong completely. I will say this about her, though. It\u2019s possible she comes from a family where money, or lack thereof, was discussed prolifically as she was growing up, hence her curiosity about what things cost. You taught her a valuable lesson, and I hope she learns from it moving forward. \n\nIf it were me, I would not apologize, and I\u2019m definitely someone who apologizes when I need to.", "NTA and I\u2019d never apologize to this human cash register.", "NYA how odd for someone to do that. It's none of her business", "NTA. You actually did her a favor, she should know better than to make comments like that. Its extremely rude. Hopefully next time she\u2019ll think before she speaks.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother is blinded by \"love\", or sex.  So he is going to defend her poor behavior.  You don't owe them an apology.  \n\nNow, that said, if you do think this may be serious, you may choose to give an apology just to not have a whole rift in your family.  But she needs to know she was wrong.", "I think your perception and feelings are valid.\n\nI kind of feel like this is a situation where I would want to meet the person in question to make a judgment. Is she generally kind of socially awkward? Some people have obsessions with things that come off crass but they don't see it or mean it that way. It could be undiagnosed autism as women are generally not diagnosed as often even when they have it.\n\nFor sure you are NTA but she may or may not be depending on her situation.", "Your brother better wear multiple condoms cause Lindsay's going for gold", "Yeah that\u2019s a big NTA for me. It would be one thing if she made one comment, brother talked to her and then that was it\u2026.but to continuously make comments is rude. I don\u2019t think she can blame ignorance either, because this is just basic human civility and manners. My 5 year old knows not to talk about money.  \n\nJust gross behavior\u2026was she raised in a cave?

Especially when it\u2019s only for 2 days.", "No babe, her boyfriend tried to on her behalf.", "Yeah, I do disagree. \n\nWhy did you aim to offend? What's wrong with 'Lindsay, could we please stop talking about money, it's uncomfortable'?", "Okay, fair, but then do the parents get to?\nEdit: no they don't.\nWas under the impression that it was their house, not OP's, but it was OP's.\nI'm standing by my opinion that \"gold digger\" was ridiculous and uncalled for, but Lindsay's behaviour was certainly wrong.", "Because I thought she was being purposefully unpleasant and I snapped. I don\u2019t (or didn\u2019t at that time) see a conceivable reason for her acting like that other than for the purpose of making people uncomfortable.", "that's a weird leap to make if she wasn't otherwise being unpleasant", "I didn't realize people might consider it rude to ask about the cost of things until I was in my late 20s. I was raised in a household and community where we talked about that openly, and asking about the cost of things was generally a chance for someone to brag about what a good deal they got, lol.\n\nI  know other etiquette rules, so I'm sure people were surprised when I didn't know this one. Someone had to specifically mention it to me (thankfully, pivately) before I learned it. I was just oblivious. \n\nYour calling out the GF publicly was rude and awkward for everyone. Calling her a gold digger was unnecessary hurtful. Why didn't you just take her aside and let her know she was being impolite?"]}
