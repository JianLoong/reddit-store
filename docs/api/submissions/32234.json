I come home frequently on the weekends to see family, and this weekend I came home to cat-sit for my mom. Her and her boyfriend are going away for a spontaneous trip (she told me yesterday and I came home that night to take care of the cat). \n\nHer boyfriend recently moved into our house (less than a year ago), which is my childhood home. It has caused a lot of tension in my relationship with my mom. She never directly told me that he was moving in, and i have never had a good relationship with him over the past decade that he has been involved with my mom. \n\nWhen i came home this weekend, there were cameras (5 total, 2 outside and 3 inside) in the house and recording. No one told me about them. I know that her boyfriend installed them, as this is not something my mom would do herself. I strongly feel this has everything to do with control and nothing about saftey. There were multiple windows left unlocked, so if that was really the reason to instill cameras in the family room that is irrational. I felt so disrespected. It is common decency to tell someone (who lives in this home) that there are cameras installed in the common living areas and only one person (boyfriend) can access the video feed. \n\nI confronted my mom about this and told her they both crossed a line and i don\u2019t know how she expects me to want to live here. (she wants me to move home after college before i start grad school). I already felt so uncomfortable with him living here and have addressed it in the the past. She responded saying I ruined her trip and that the cameras weren\u2019t installed to watch me. i explained that whatever the reason, they are recording every room of the house and that i should have at-least been informed. she deflected saying that most people have cameras in their home. i continued to say that she was missing the point. I just can\u2019t get through to her. it seems like this guy just is destroying my relationship with my mom and i don\u2019t know what to do.", "created_utc": 1701574708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189ko83/aita_moms_bf_installs_5_cameras_in_house_without/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In response to others' comments - I, too have camera inside and outside my house for safety purposes. I don't watch anyone or anything streaming, but it helps me to monitor the pets, packages being delivered, elderly parent/fall risk and being able to see if hubby's car is in garage or if he has gotten home from work yet.

It would have been different if the mom and boyfriend had mentioned \"oh hey we installed cameras btw but you are welcome to cover or disable them if youre uncomfortable\" omitting info like that and then acting ignorant when someone is understandably upset by this is just weird.

My kid will move the camera so that it\u2019s pointing at the ceiling and I\u2019ve had to tell him that if I can\u2019t keep my home safe but having cameras, then he will be in serious trouble. It\u2019s one camera in our main room. We have a lot of substance abusers in our neighborhood.

We had a camera covering the hallway to the bedrooms (aimes at stairs that come up) but not directly at the rooms or bathrooms.", "I have cameras inside to cover entrances and the living room (where most of the expensive items are) because I don\u2019t trust the area I live in and my dog can be a random AH and get into something.\n\nEdit to add: After reading some comments, and re-reading the post, my wife and I both have access to them and don\u2019t arm them unless we leave. You can tell when they\u2019re on because they have big, bright blue lights so you could tell if one of us is watching (which would be creepy). We live in an apartment complex so putting them outside to cover the entrances isn\u2019t possible."]}
