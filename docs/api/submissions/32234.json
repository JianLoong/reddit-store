I come home frequently on the weekends to see family, and this weekend I came home to cat-sit for my mom. Her and her boyfriend are going away for a spontaneous trip (she told me yesterday and I came home that night to take care of the cat). \n\nHer boyfriend recently moved into our house (less than a year ago), which is my childhood home. It has caused a lot of tension in my relationship with my mom. She never directly told me that he was moving in, and i have never had a good relationship with him over the past decade that he has been involved with my mom. \n\nWhen i came home this weekend, there were cameras (5 total, 2 outside and 3 inside) in the house and recording. No one told me about them. I know that her boyfriend installed them, as this is not something my mom would do herself. I strongly feel this has everything to do with control and nothing about saftey. There were multiple windows left unlocked, so if that was really the reason to instill cameras in the family room that is irrational. I felt so disrespected. It is common decency to tell someone (who lives in this home) that there are cameras installed in the common living areas and only one person (boyfriend) can access the video feed. \n\nI confronted my mom about this and told her they both crossed a line and i don\u2019t know how she expects me to want to live here. (she wants me to move home after college before i start grad school). I already felt so uncomfortable with him living here and have addressed it in the the past. She responded saying I ruined her trip and that the cameras weren\u2019t installed to watch me. i explained that whatever the reason, they are recording every room of the house and that i should have at-least been informed. she deflected saying that most people have cameras in their home. i continued to say that she was missing the point.

I really don't get your conflicting statements that you live in this home, but you also live in an apartment. If you still lived there then you'd have a right to complain.

So the only issue here is that Mom didn't inform OP post-camera install when she asked OP to catsit.\n\nEven given that it's only a curtesy, not a big privacy invasion because it's someone's home and they're not hidden, not an AirBnB. She's a guest, not a customer. If I'm paying for a service from strangers I would not be ok with it. But I also wouldn't demand they take them down because it is their property. I would go somewhere else. In this scenario if it bothered me I wouldn't catsit.\n\nSo in summary: he didn't need to tell her that he was going to install cameras. He didn't need to insert himself between mom and daughter to tell her about them when mom asked her to catsit. Lastly it's not a big deal that mom neglected to tell her daughter about them."]}
