Before that happened, my niece Isabela was bullied by a classmate named Joey in middle school. Taylor had to request a meeting with the school to demand Joey be separated from Isabela because Joey had been making extremely unacceptable comments towards her. Joey had been causing issues for other classmates as well, such as purposely spilling drinks into another kid\u2019s backpack or taking another kid\u2019s notebook and threatening to tear up the pages. Joey was kept separate from Isabela, and he attended a different high school. Isabela said she thought she would never have to see Joey again.\r  \n\r  \nWell, Taylor and her now husband Asher had dated for four years. They decided only after getting engaged to introduce each others\u2019 children, which is when Isabela discovered that Asher\u2019s son was the same Joey who used to bully her. Obviously, this immediately caused some issues. Taylor uses the same explanations as Joey, which is that Joey was an ignorant kid and didn\u2019t know any better, and his parents\u2019 divorce pushed him to act out. While I\u2019m sure those things are true, Isabela says that Joey refuses to take self-accountability.\r  \n\r  \nAccording to Isabela, Taylor and Asher keep trying to push her to be friends with Joey. Isabela will explain that she just doesn\u2019t want to hang out with Joey, but her mom will simply go behind her back. For example, Taylor invited Isabela to go to the mall saying it would be just the two of them, Isabela agreed, and then Joey hopped in the car at the last second because they were all going to shop at the mall together.\r  \n\r  \nTaylor explains that she and especially Asher are upset that Isabela doesn\u2019t want to include him or Joey in activities. She\u2019s also worried because Isabela has been mentioning moving out, which Taylor thinks is too soon because she\u2019s only nineteen. Taylor says she and Joey should just be friends now that they\u2019re stepsiblings (this is why she and Asher didn\u2019t introduce children until after their engagement.)\r  \n\r  \nI told Taylor that she can\u2019t force Isabela to be friends with Joey just because they are now stepsiblings. Taylor kept giving me the same explanations for Joey\u2019s behavior. I told Taylor if Joey has truly changed and is genuinely remorseful for the way he treated Isabela, then he would understand that he is not entitled to Isabela\u2019s friendship. Trying to force a friendship never works outside of movies regardless. She\u2019ll only strain her relationship with her daughter if she doesn\u2019t let go of her \u201cbecome best friends\u201d expectation.\r  \n\r  \nIsabela thanked me later for trying to reason with her mom, but my parents had the opposite reaction. Taylor was devastated by her first husband\u2019s death and she finally found someone new who makes her happy, so they said of course she wants her family to get along.
