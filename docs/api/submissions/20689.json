Joey had been causing issues for other classmates as well, such as purposely spilling drinks into another kid\u2019s backpack or taking another kid\u2019s notebook and threatening to tear up the pages. Joey was kept separate from Isabela, and he attended a different high school. Isabela said she thought she would never have to see Joey again.\r  \n\r  \nWell, Taylor and her now husband Asher had dated for four years. They decided only after getting engaged to introduce each others\u2019 children, which is when Isabela discovered that Asher\u2019s son was the same Joey who used to bully her. Obviously, this immediately caused some issues. Taylor uses the same explanations as Joey, which is that Joey was an ignorant kid and didn\u2019t know any better, and his parents\u2019 divorce pushed him to act out. While I\u2019m sure those things are true, Isabela says that Joey refuses to take self-accountability.\r  \n\r  \nAccording to Isabela, Taylor and Asher keep trying to push her to be friends with Joey. Isabela will explain that she just doesn\u2019t want to hang out with Joey, but her mom will simply go behind her back.

She\u2019s also worried because Isabela has been mentioning moving out, which Taylor thinks is too soon because she\u2019s only nineteen.
