A few days ago we where at a birthday celebration for a friend of my fianc\u00e9. He said he and his family would love to visit and \"is anyone allergic or can we bring the dog?\" In other words leaving no room for us to decline the dog to come if we aren't allergic, which we aren't.\n\nI have always loved dogs, but I don't want them inside my home. Dogs are dirty, they don't take their shoes off (I live in a county where we do and it would be unimaginable not to), wipe after going to the bathroom nor wear pants. I don't want one running inside my home (or any animal for that matter). If we had a yard the dog would be welcome to stay there but we don't.\n\nThis got me thinking of another couple we would like to get to know better since we moved to the same town, they also have dogs and if we where to invite them to us my guess is that they would just bring the dogs, which makes us not want to invite them even though we really would love to.\n\nI also have a relative that also always just brings her dog to family parties (held at my mum's) without asking first. That dog is extremely energetic (and perhaps not well mannered?) and always runs around like crazy, jumps up on couches, beds, people etc. My mom is on top of that scared of dogs because of a traumatic experience when she was a kid.\n\nI feel like the social norm here is that it's totally okay to just bring the dog without asking first, which I find strange. It makes me feel like I'm the bad guy for not welcoming dogs with open arms into my home. I understand the dog becomes a part of the family and getting a sitter just to hang out with friends is a pain, but I just find it so disrespectful to just assume and not ask first.\n\nWIBTA if I politely told out friends and relatives that we don't want dogs in our home when inviting them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1702826568, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kjlao/wibta_for_asking_friends_to_not_bring_their_dogs/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dogs are perfectly capable of staying home without supervision. I have a dog and I love my dog, but I would never just assume that I can bring her to other people's homes without asking. I take my dog lots of places with me, but not into other people's homes or businesses.", "NTA. This is so weird. I don't bring my cats over to a strange house.. Why should people do this randomly with dogs?", "NTA.  I have a \"no pets\" rule at my house.  I just don't want to deal with the mess of cleaning up after an accident; but also, I don't want to worry about another guest's allergies (I'm always surprised by how many people are allergic to cats) or anxieties about being around animals.", "NTA.\n\nYou have EVERY right to tell people not to bring their dogs with them.\n\nI would just include with invitations a sentence to the effect of, \u201cWhile we\u2019re happy to host you for (event), we have a pet-free home and your pets will need to stay home.\u201d", "NTA - Ugh. I hate these uncomfortable situations. But it's 100% not your fault. It's so rude to make presumptions about other peoples' homes when you visit them. It will be uncomfortable, but at the end of the day, it's your home and it's perfectly ok to set those boundaries.", "Nta. But your fianc\u00e9 has to also be on your side. Seems like he isn\u2019t.", "Yeah, you'd be a total asshole for not wanting dogs in your own damn house. Like, what kind of monster are you? Just let the stinky little furballs traipse all over your furniture and make a mess everywhere. Your friends will totally understand and respect your boundaries...(not). Grow up and just tell them straight up no dogs allowed.", "My dogs don\u2019t like other dogs in the house and everyone seems to understand that. However, if a human doesn\u2019t like dogs in their house people will try to push this by saying \u201cyou won\u2019t notice\u201d or \u201cthey are well behaved.\u201d \n\nThis is your home, your castle. Feel comfortable saying \u201cthanks for asking first - dogs aren\u2019t allowed\u201d and leave it at that. Hopefully they will respect your boundaries. NTA", "NTA\n\nBeing allergic is not the only reason not to have dogs in your house. It's your home and you don't have to have them there if you don't want to. Just don't make a big deal about it. It's OK to say \"I'm sorry, but having dogs over just doesn't work for us.\" You don't have to give any reasons.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to explain why except politely say that would not work for you. I also have a dog but would always ask before thinking of bringing him to someone else\u2019s home and not be upset if they said no. I also never even ask if I know there will be large crowds or young kids at the house. My dog loves kids as he as around my young grandkids but he is big and excited to meet people. He could accidentally knock one down or scare someone.", "NTA, OP. Dogs don\u2019t always need sitters if left alone for a few hours, either. It\u2019s not always the norm here to bring one\u2019s dog without checking first. I would always ask, personally, and not just if there are allergies. Dogs are often friendly and lovable, and welcome additions to a gathering. But not everyone is comfortable with pets (I know some who dislike cats a great deal); it\u2019s only courteous to leave the pets at home unless they are specifically invited, too. You may need to come up with a phrase that is as gentle and mild as possible when inviting others (not insinuating in any way that their dog is at all dirty, not that you would, but be careful here). You could say with honesty that you\u2019re unable, sadly, to have dogs over, as you have developed some sensitivities to them in close quarters/indoors. You aren\u2019t claiming allergies, but are implying a reaction that no guest would want to cause. If they probe for more details, they are being rude and nosy, but also you could just say that you\u2019ve been told it\u2019s best for you to avoid too much exposure. If they press further, change the subject as gracefully as possible. Let them think it may be medical, as it is indeed about your well-being, in a more general sense.", "NTA. I have dogs and I would never consider bringing them to someone else's house unless there was an explicit invite to bring them, and even then I likely wouldn't unless there's a very good reason for it (puppy play date, photo shoot, etc).\n\nIt annoys me supremely when someone just assumes that whoever they're visiting would appreciate having their dogs come visit too. If they have pets, then it would likely cause conflict or stress between them, and if they don't have pets, there is probably a reason, such as they don't like pets or don't want them in their house. \n\nThe default should always be not taking your pets with you when you visit someone.", "Hell naw, you not the asshole here. Ain't nothin' wrong with wantin' to keep your house clean and dog free. Just straight up tell folks upfront that ain't nobody bringin' their dogs in yo crib and if they can't respect that then they can stay at home with Fido. No need for fancy words or pleasantries, just speak yo mind. Been there done that myself so I feel ya on this one bruh", "I think it\u2019s reasonable to ask people not to bring their dogs. Also this might be controversial but I would totally lie and claim I was allergic to avoid any awkwardness, but that might be a failing on my part. \ud83d\ude06 Another option would be to compromise and ask your friends to either put clean little booties on their dog or maybe get some wet wipes and paper towels by the front door and ask them to wipe their dog\u2019s paws before coming in, if your main concern is cleanliness.", "NTA there are people who are allergic to dogs and the norm here is different, but for that reason even though we have a dog we would never think of bringing him to someone else\u2019s house unless asked. He\u2019s fine alone for a few hours during the day. You can just say you know people with allergies and don\u2019t want dogs in your house if you want to avoid further debate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Anyone else? Forget it. That\u2019s so damn rude to even ask, imo.

It's just that some people flout social norms and get away with it because they know how to  manipulate other people. I don't think dogs need a sitter if they are left alone for an evening, but even if they did, that's their owners' problem, not yours. \n\nIn the case of your friends, their phrasing of their question is likely borne of long years of learning how to manipulate others. They are trying to ask the question in such a way as to enforce the answer they want, and essentially to either guilt-trip you or TRICK you into answering the way they want. (e.g. if you said \"No, we're not allergic\" then they might take that to mean you agreed to them bringing the dog even though you actually said no such thing. That's the \"trick\" part. The \"guilt-trip\" part is the part where they act as if, as long as no one is allergic, you have no right to decline them bringing their dog.) Personally, I would find this sort of behavior a bit of a red flag and maybe put some distance between me and these \"friends\" but you know them in person, I'm just a stranger on the internet, so you do what makes sense to you.\n\nBut in terms of your friends' question, you can answer by saying, \"No, I won't be able to accommodate your dogs so you'll have to leave them at home if you plan to come. Thanks for asking.\" \n\nYou have to keep your mind sharp when you are around people like this, because they sound like people who are good at twisting your words to hear the answer they want. That's why you need to use clear language. If you say things like, \"I'd prefer if you left your dog at home\" they might interpret that to mean, \"I'd prefer if you didn't bring your dog, but if you want to bring him, go ahead.\" You have to be really clear.", "Actually he is! We discussed this recently.", "I\u2019m not sure that making up an allergy is the best idea. Just keeping up that lie for years would be exhausting.", "Sorry I misread about that allergy part. Still NTA regardless of allergy. Your house your rules.", "Oh, I fully admit it\u2019s probably a bad idea. \ud83d\ude06 Though I hate chocolate & a lot of people try to force me to eat it so for years now I\u2019ve just claimed I have an allergy by saying \u201cIt makes the back of my throat tickle & I don\u2019t want to risk it,\u201d & that\u2019s usually enough to get everybody off my case. But I acknowledge that\u2019s not a good solution for everybody."]}
