{"id": 238, "submission_id": "yhvh9p", "title": "AITA for not taking my kids trick or treating because I don\u2019t want to walk up a hill?", "selftext": "How my kids reacted; My kids loved the baskets and especially loved the hot chocolate bombs! When it was time to set up the fort for movies they did an awesome job decorating it. My oldest even used some of the Halloween decorations to make it extra spooky and we had a popcorn fight and used some of the edible glitter to make magic potion snacks with some of their candy while we watched movies.\n\nThey had a really great time. They\u2019re currently asleep, snuggled up in the living room with each other while I\u2019m about to clean up the messes we made before I sleep, too. I think I\u2019m going to label these baskets a huge success!\n\nMy kids (f7 and f2\u2013almost 3) were super excited for Halloween this year. It\u2019s my favorite holiday so I\u2019m always excited, too. I went all out for costumes and stuff like always. My oldest is Sally, my youngest chose Ariel, I planned to wear my Lumine cosplay that I spent almost a year making. \n\nExcept my town moved the trick or treat night from Saturday to Monday. This sucks for us, because we live on the top of a pretty steep hill and their dad will have the car for work since he works night shift. Trick or treat starts at 7 and he leaves for work at 7. Now, I walk up this hill when I absolutely have to, but I really try to avoid it. It\u2019s 8 blocks to the top and it\u2019s steep the entire way. Pushing a stroller up is hell, convincing a toddler to walk up it is even more hell. I have asthma and I often struggle up the hill with it. \n\nSo I canceled trick or treat plans, because I can\u2019t do that hill with two kids after walking around trick or treating. Instead, I bought them baskets for a Halloween camp in and movie night. They have Halloween themed pajamas, some spooky cups for hot chocolate, books, a coloring book, a make your own monster kit and spooky face masks. I also stayed up late to hand make some skull shaped hot chocolate bombs with edible glitter and I made little ghost shaped marshmallows for it. I also have candy and popcorn. \n\nBut their grandparents are being harsh about it. They said I\u2019m ruining the holiday and that I should be ashamed that I\u2019m \u201cdepriving them\u201d of trick or treat just because I\u2019m \u201clazy.\u201d They also claim my kids would hate the baskets and be pressured to lie about their feelings because of it. I guess it could be selfish to cancel just because of the walk home and maybe I should just tough it out. I don\u2019t want to ruin my kid\u2019s holiday. \n\nSo AITA for not taking them just because the walk home would suck?\n\nEDIT: I asked both my friends and grandparents for rides or help. They couldn\u2019t do it. I have comments explaining why. I did try to find alternatives. \n\nMy local taxi cab service says online that they close at 7, but it doesn\u2019t say if the business location closes at 7 or if that means they stop doing rides at 7. Either way, I have no money right now. My bank account is at a whopping $2.41 right now. \n\nMy kids did go to the Halloween parade in town this year and they did go to the school Halloween parade (which my oldest daughter was in). We didn\u2019t go to trunk or treat because my kids were sick when it happened, but my oldest didn\u2019t want to go anyway for some reason and my toddler didn\u2019t know about it to care. We\u2019ve never missed trick or treat before and we do participate in as many Halloween activities as we can when they come around. \n\nMy town is surrounded by mountains. I feel like a lot of people on here may not be familiar with rural, mountainous towns. View the landscape as a bowl and the town is in the middle of it. They built up into the mountains and if you\u2019re unlucky enough to live in the edges of the town where they built up the mountain it\u2019s not very fun. The only perk is that my house is too high in elevation to be flooded during rainy seasons. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nBecause of this the people here have made a normal event of going to the bottom of the hill to hand out candy. You won\u2019t find houses up here with lights on and hoping kids walk up the hill for it. They go to the bottom of the hill and hand it out there.\n\nETA 2: My kid\u2019s dad is my ex-husband. We just live together and co-parent. I\u2019m sorry if my post made it seem like we\u2019re a couple or anything. I sometimes forget to clarify that so I don\u2019t confuse people in replies.\n\nETA 3: I don\u2019t know why this is a thing, but asthma is not an \u201cobesity\u201d disease. I don\u2019t know why there\u2019s a link between people telling me to lose weight and work out because I have asthma. I was born with it, I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d and 121lbs. I\u2019m not losing weight and I\u2019m not cool with any of the fatphobic shit I\u2019m seeing. I\u2019m not losing weight.

Mountainous neighborhoods are a bear (maybe those too).  Starting at 7pm means starting with two over excited and tired kids.  All of this adds up.

And there is always next year. Next year you can try those trunk and treat events that communities and churches usually set up on weekend around Halloween.

I usually just took my kids around the block or down to the end of the street and back depending on weather. \nIf this hill is really the only option and it cannot be done till 7 then just have a movie night at home and try again next year, they did partake in events already it sounds like.", "NTA and as a mom with asthma, I understand.
