We volunteered to pay for all lodging for everyone if they could pay for transportation and incidentals.  We invited everyone last July for an April vacation.  We wanted this to be a chance for our immediate family to be together and enjoy the experience and each other. We did not invite any friends or other relatives including my oldest daughter\u2019s (43 F) stepson (20M). This was a hard choice but we knew we had to make some determination otherwise we would be trying to find a place for my in-laws, and some of our friends and a lot of other people we love \n\nLast week my youngest daughter M (35F) and her wife (35F) told me that they had promised their nephew L( 10M) a tropical vacation that was canceled due to Covid. L is a nephew on my daughter-in-law\u2019s side and we have met him a few times, but he is not our relative and not someone any of the other kids or grandkids have a relationship with \n\nAfter my wife and I talked, we told M that we really want them there, but we want this to be \u201cour family\u201d and that we wouldn\u2019t feel right about adding L. L would have slept in the room with M\u2019s kids so there would have been no expense, just a child guest that nobody knows outside of M\u2019s family.\n\nWhen we told M that, M told us that she can\u2019t see taking this vacation without L, and that if we can\u2019t change our minds then they won\u2019t be joining us. \n\nTwo of our kids are saying we did the right thing, otherwise we open the trip up to whoever decides to join. One of our kids is saying we are TA because L would have fun with his cousins and wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden or a time burden on us. \n\nMy wife and I are struggling. We have already excluded people we are close to, when we sent the original invitation. And they had 7 months to bring up L and just told us this week. \n\nTo complicate things, M and her wife have been semi-estranged from us off and on. They tend to drift out of our lives for months at a time until they need something, then they stuck around for a little bit before drifting off again. So I really wanted this to be an experience that all of our kids and grandkids could share. Now my daughter, her wife, and their two sons, who we are least close to, will miss out. \n\nSo should we stick to our guns or are we TA and need to let them bring L?", "created_utc": 1673739677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10c4dm8/aita_for_excluding_my_daughter_from_a_trip_of_a/", "score": 254, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or when he was eighteen and in college and she doesn't know him very well either?", "That's what I'm saying", "Because without more information, it is actually appropriate to base a judgment on assuming that the relationship is otherwise normal. Otherwise, every post would be far too long. If something is truly unusual, like if it had been an adult stepson or a marriage after only 3 months, it's on OP to mention it.", "That's exactly what I'm saying, I'm assuming this is a normal age _child_ that most people would consider a stepson, not an adult child. If it's something that unusual or specific, it's on OP to mention it. Otherwise people are going to and should assume it's just a normal situation.", "I never said anything like that. If this is a regular stepchild who grew up thinking of these grandparents like his own biological grandparents, or if they were close like healthy families usually are, obviously that's not the same as if he had married into the family last year.", "If he grew up thinking of these people as grandparents, that's a totally different story from his family marrying into this family last year.", "If three of four kids\u2019 families involve stepchildren, it\u2019s doubtful that all of the steps were adults when the parents were married. Their oldest daughter is 43 and her stepson is 20. Most likely some of these step kids are still minors and almost certainly some were when their parents were married.", "Like I said, you can say the same thing about a child in law. You can accept one and reject another or want nothing to do with any of them. And that kind of attitude makes them an AH, absent some kind of mitigating circumstance. There\u2019s no legal obligation of course. It\u2019s just a really crappy way to approach having a family.", "You are correct, parents don\u2019t have to accept their children and their family. They have that free will. That free will makes them AH. Not sure in what universe it wouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s like saying, \u201cI accept this person as my daughter-in-law but not this other one.\u201d Yeah, you can do it, but it makes you an AH, unless there are very specific reasons you need to cut them out of your life.", "Why is it normal to expect that step grandson has been in anyone's life long-term or that step grandson wants a relationship with step family? It's like 50/50 if the kid wants to have a relationship with their step family, so I really don't get why one assumption is \"more correct\" than another without any fucking context.", "OP said in the post he's 20. He's not actually a child.", "Again, it's a two-way street. A step relationship, even between the parent's new partner and the child, requires mutual consent. That goes doubley for people that don't have any sort of legal relationship to the child.\n\n\nThe child already has 4 grandparents. It doesn't automatically wind up with 6 just because their child decided to hook up with someone who already has a child.", "Oo that's what everyone has been saying. What age was this kid when she became stepmother. Wast he 13 ro 18 it makes a massive difference.  U just assumed he was young. U also said something about as soon as they married is long enough. That's wack", "A child in law will literally always come along as an adult, so it's not the same thing.\n\n\nYou can't just rock up one day with a child and tell your parents to automatically have a relationship with said random child that isn't related to them in any way and treat this strsnger identically to their literal grandchildren. There's also the giant caveat that if they *do* end up bonding with the child, that bond is totally dependent on the whims of the actual parent *and* on if the marriage actually lasts (and given that half of all msrriages fail thats a big if). If that marriage ends, then *poof* there goes the relationship.\n\n\nThe kid already has 4 grandparents and he gets the option to reject the entire step family without being labeled an AH. He doesn't also get the option to enforce a step relationship. Those happen through mutual consent.", "Not now, but when they were married, that he would have _been_ a child and that they have known them since then. Not that he's mostly a stranger to them.", "You're also making a bunch of assumptions here, it's unlikely that a 20-year-old still has all 4 grandparents. And they're married, it's not just a \"hook up.\" Again, unless OP states so, generally speaking, people should be expecting the average situation. Most people would refer to someone who married into the family as nearly an adult as an adult child or something like that, or at least an internet as an adult stepson we haven't been close to.", "Yes, but OP has avoided answering that so we should actually assume a normal situation and not an abnormal one. People are just mad, they want to assume OP is golden when they might actually be a mix of okay and not okay.", "I've only made one assumption based purely on averages.\n\n\nIt's highly likely that \"generally speaking,\" a 20 year old has 4 grandparents still. Even if we only go off of averages, the average age to have a child when said young man was born was 25. The average age to have a child in 1987 was 24. That puts the grandparents at approximately 69. That's 12 years short of them kicking the bucket, statistically speaking.\n\n\nBut again, you're avoiding my point. Step relationships are by mutual consent. They didn't marry into the extended family. They're legally related to only a single person.", "Nah ur focusing on something that wasn't even asked. Op wants to know about the nephew and uve honed in on this. Did the 20 yr old complain, did stepmother? Probably not cuz that's what the aita post would be about. He is asking about the nephew for a reason", "Yeah but that's also an assumption to make that isn't really appropriate. A lot of people are making judgments on the stepson issue already, and how they have treated other people who have been excluded is really important here."]}
