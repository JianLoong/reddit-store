(Granted we are getting close to mowing being done for the year, but we probably have at least one or two mows left lol) Yesterday, new neighbor left a note on my door while I was working asking when their yard would be done. \n\nI went over to talk to them and explained that I mowed for my former neighbor because of his age, and for the son because he was paying me.

Where people will decorate your lawn with a blowup snowman to make the neighborhood look nicer. \n\nSome neighborhoods might drop off a dinner dish every Friday because they adore cooking. So a realtor might add \u201cdon\u2019t be surprised when you get a free dinner each week\u201d. \n\nSome neighbors might be retired and offer to watch the kids for free and they can swim whenever they want to at their house. \n\nOther neighbors will own a pressure washing business and clean everyone\u2019s driveway and gutters as a favor each year.", "And for no one to check before signing anything!", "Right? Was it written in the contract somewhere? Unheard-of!", "Loan a lawnmower?  For this kind of entitlement, NOPE.  If you feel kind, rent the lawnmower to them - but insist on a hefty deposit to cover potential (likely) damage to the mower.", "Me as well. At least a year or more ago. Word for word too. I read it expecting it to be a little different but even the update is the same.", "Exactly, ridiculous. If I was OP I would be pissed at the son who made this promise.", "I really need one of those! Mine is a riding mower that I share with my sister who lives a block away, but I really want to get my own next summer. I like mowing too, I put in some headphones and get to work haha.", "I don\u2019t think he lives very close to be fair. We live kinda in the middle of nowhere, town of 300 people lol. But yeah he wasn\u2019t around a whole lot when my neighbor was still here.", "Honestly I\u2019m guessing they reached out to the son mostly because they were lied to, and then he tried to convince me to do it lol. I don\u2019t think they did it because they wanted to force me to mow or something. At least I hope, I try to think the best of people hahah", "yeah I have some opinions about the son lol. I don\u2019t know him super well but some of his actions before/since my neighbors death are effed up.", "I realize that the new owners were lied to, but how dense do they have to be in this mix-up? Mowing services offered in perpetuity, attached to the house regardless of changes in ownership? Who has ever heard of such a thing?\n\nLike, did they think there is some indentured servant who is bound to serve the house? Is this house sentient? You make contracts (like multi-year mowing deals) with other human beings and/or organizations, not with property. And those contracts have terms, conditions, and termination dates. They have provisions for transfer of the contract (if allowed at all).\n\n**EDIT:** The realtors involved in this sale are also liable here, as no mention of landscaping or maintenance services should have ever been communicated to the buyers through either agent without proper documentation. If this was an actual term written in the sale agreement, the new owners probably have grounds for a small lawsuit. The realtors could be professionally reprimanded through their licensing body.", "/u/Fluffy_Astronom is a comment-stealing bot.

If someone bought a house in my neighborhood and left a note on the door asking when I was mowing their lawn, I\u2019d be laughing for about the next ten minutes.  The same when the son called.", "And what portion of the sale did the son give you since he so generously offered your landscape services? I\u2019m guessing the answer is zero. Of course NTA. That\u2019s like offering up your neighbors pool because they let you swim in it a couple times", "I wouldn\u2019t hold this against them. They were explicitly and deliberately misled. This is completely on the son/realtor.", "Even if they offer to pay, don't do it. Normally it's good to be on good terms with neighbors, but not if they think you're a doormat", "Feel free to tell the son he can continue to pay you for it if he likes.  His previous agreement didn't indenture you.", "To be fair, age doesn\u2019t mean they are able but still. The son had no right to offer you up to them", "Yep, they were gullible but not AHs if they were told to believe this. Bet they feel quite embarrassed now.", "This is a completely 100% different situation. This isn't an HOA with lawn services - this is a case of someone promising a homeowner that a neighbor would cut their lawn for free.", "My old HOA handles all lawn maintenance, all flowers and bushes being planted, all sidewalk and driveway and walkway snow removal and salting. All garbage pickup. Etc", "What in the America is that?", "What's an HOA?", "My local HOA costs about $30 a year and that maintains the local parks.  Since we're a rural area, we wouldn't have parks or playgrounds without the HOA.\n\nAnother HOA charges about $150 a month, but they mow lawns, have a community pool free for members, maintain jogging trails, and shovel snow off the sidewalks all winter long.  The more expensive HOAs tend to control what you can plant in your yard, because *they* are the ones who have to maintain it.  Same for controlling where people park, because of it stains the concrete or breaks a sprinkler system, the HOA is the one who is paying for it.\n\nA few even cover things like fence repair and exterior paint.", "A colleague lived in a block of flats where the occupants had bin bags dropped off at each door by the council. They had to drop the filled bin bags into  the dumpsters outside the flats.   \n\n\nMy colleague would take down the bin bags for elderly neighbours...but then younger folk started to leave theirs for him as well.   \n\n\nHe knocked at the door of one flat to explain that they needed to take down their own bin bag. 'Oh, no...' replied the occupant. 'David does that.'  \n\n\nMy colleague was David.", "And let's cast some major shade on the real estate agent for blithely going along without checking!", "I was just trying to think of how to be neighborly to my next door neighbor, who'm I'll probably see frequently for a very long time.  Sounds like it was the person who sold the house that was the crazy one, although they were awfully naive to get pulled into that.", "I guess I can see being annoyed at being lied to and wanting an explanation, but also... it's not likely it was a deciding factor in their purchase of the home.", "Dobbie is a free elf.", "I agree totally with your take here.  Sad that they seemed to fall for it. Even more sad that son thought that OP would do this for free in perpetuity. SMH", "Some HOA\u2019s have lawn services so it\u2019s not unheard of to think it\u2019s already been arranged.", "Oh yeah I don\u2019t. I actually just added an update that the neighbor came by to apologize. If they\u2019d continued to be rude that might be another story haha.", "No one is allowed to be that dumb.  This shister couple just tried to get free lawn service. \nBad new neighbors", "They can buy a house but can't figure out the realtor was feeding them a line of BS?", "I hope they sue the realtor", "Home Owners Association. They enforce various guidelines and some upkeep the area. You pay them a monthly fee. My HOA costs around $200, includes maintenance of shared property, driveway/parking lot maintenance, landscaping, enforcement of various codes (like don't leave trash on your stairs) and also heating and water (since we live in a mutli fam building). Some HOAs in my area cost over $800 per month (which you pay ON TOP of all your mortgage costs) \n\nAll HOAs are different, most are annoying but I personally like mine. You often hear of HOAs enforcing weird laws, and iirc some have the power to enforce penalties. They are usually run by a board, which you can join if you're a part of the HOA community.", "I think we pay just north of $300/year.\n\nFor that we get NastyGrams that let us know that our lawn looks bad, plus the ability to ask the management company to send our petition to change our roof/front door/fence to the HOA's architectural committee so they can approve or deny.\n\nIt can take months for them to reply. \n\nWe have to mow our own lawns, maintain our own fences and the like.", "You can be neighborly without being sucked into this bit of drama.  The issue is between the new neighbor and the seller - there is no need to be drawn into any piece of this problem.  OP mowed because there was a relationship with the previous owner.  The new owner needs to establish a relationship before (and if ever) making an ask.\n\nIn this case, the new neighbors either were told something that was untrue (they were lied to) or they \u201cmisunderstood\u201d the situation.  In either case, I see no reason that OP needs to fix anything.  Unfortunately, the level of cluelessness that is involved in believing it is normal to buy a house with mowing service included makes me think that any generous gesture on the part of OP will be met with the expectation of more of the same.  The sooner the new homeowners develop the understanding that it is their property - and therefore their responsibility- the better.", "lol!", "If the HOA was responsible for lawn services, it would be written into the CCR.", "They must have been so embarrassed!! I'd be embarrassed enough to mow your lawn a couple of times.", "Hard same if they were entitled/demanding! Honest mistake. I\u2019m side eyeing everyone calling them dumb. I assume they\u2019re first time home owners and the realtor explicitly told them a falsehood. That\u2019s not their fault.\n\nGood neighbors like you are worth their weight in gold, and it sounds like they\u2019re well aware of that since they came over to apologize. I\u2019d say you have pretty good/smart neighbors, too!", "That's a bit extreme no? Who makes a decision to buy a house based on lawn-mowing?", "The rule is that no one is allowed to be that stupid.", "\u201cLawn care services included in home sake price\u201d\n\nLawsuits started for less", "It probably won't change too much. But dpeending on the market and negotiations could change the buying price by a few thousand.\n\nIf the realtor actually lied (a big \"if\"): suing is extreme. But the Realtor should certainly be reported to their licensing body and it is worth the buyer talking to their lawyer to see if they can get anything back from the sale.", "Yeah, this. It\u2019s also a big deal to lie about what\u2019s included in order to close a sale.\n\nIf he lied about this to these clients, what else has he lied about to others..?", "Have just learned about HOAs.. so I assume this is an America thing. Perhaps that was the missing context. But yes, son should have to give some back for his big porkie.", "The realtor was tbd homeowners son, this is fraud at worst contract violation at best."]}
