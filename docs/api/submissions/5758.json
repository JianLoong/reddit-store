It was a long and messy divorce, especially since she refused to leave our marriage and kept begging for a second chance. In the end she gave up but she insisted not to tell the kids about the affair as she didn\u2019t want them hating or refusing to spend time with her. She is a great mother, so I agreed. I told the kids that me and her had disagreements that couldn\u2019t be solved and for everyone\u2019s best interest, us being apart would be for the best. We also share joint custody.  \n\nHowever a few months ago my oldest kid (17F) ended up discovering the real reason why we divorced. I don\u2019t know how, she refuses to tell me but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all because my ex recently announced that she\u2019s engaged to Jim, her affair partner. My kids hated him from before but after my kid revealed the information to her twin and her young brother they loathe him and my ex. They\u2019ve become extremely rude and avoidant towards them, and are now refusing to spend any sort of time with them. With the holiday season approaching (Merry belated Christmas) my ex decided to ask me to intervene. She told me that she wanted me to sit down with the kids with her, and to explain that it was never an affair but basically that we disagreed about our marriage. She kept insisting that the kids are becoming more hateful every day, and tearfully said that they\u2019re blaming her for ending our marriage and their relationship with her. I didn\u2019t say anything, merely said that they were speaking the truth and deserved to feel however way they needed to feel about this. We got into a massive argument, and she ended up storming off saying she won\u2019t be celebrating Christmas with \u201cungrateful brats\u201d who hate her. She insinuated that I do the same, but I refused. We spend each Christmas together for the kids but this time she was a no-show. \n\nSo on Christmas Eve and day they came over to my place and we had a fun family gathering, they opened their presents and overall we had a great time. In the morning I posted several pictures of us together saying how great Christmas is with family, which my ex saw (I still have her on Facebook because sometimes she texts me stuff related to kids). She was screaming saying I made her look like the bad guy now because everyone will notice she isn\u2019t with me in the picture, and how she didn\u2019t buy them any gifts. She asked that I take away the presents until they apologise for \u201cbeing cruel to their mother\u201d and to apologise to her affair partner, or at least to withhold them until she buys them some. I refused and told her she\u2019s dealing with consequences of her own making, and since Christmas she\u2019s been posting vague posts about how horrible her \u201cold\u201d family is and how cruel love can be. \n\nAITA for refusing to punish my kids or sit down with them to justify my ex\u2019s cheating?", "created_utc": 1672130520, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwb039/aita_for_refusing_to_punish_my_kids_for_my_ex/", "score": 292, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's more upset that the kids found out over trying to make things right.  She's more offended by the \"disrespect\" than trying to understand why the kids are acting the way they are.  She wants the kids to be punished rather than take the smallest ownership over her horribly selfish destructive actions.  The pattern of behavior is clear.  You don't have to wage war with your ex but you sure as shit don't need to defend her.", "It's difficult when it comes to kids; however it doesn't give them a right to be disrespectful. The kids have their right to be upset but being rude and allowing it; it is not right; ex does have a right to speak her side with situation now that kids found out about the truth. \n\nThough it's not right that she'd trying to hide the truth in the first place; in this case NTA but Op and AH for allowing kids being disrespectful to their mother; idc for other guy.", "And it would not be fair to them to try and cover up the truth at this point. There should have always been a set age where they got to know the truth of why their family life actually fell apart. Parents like your ex demand respect but don\u2019t show it in return.  \n\nI think OP, you just have to continue to be their rock and their safe space. If they dont want a relationship with their mom, *even if she is their mom*, you cannot force them. You and your ex need to respect their wishes. The only person that is making themselves look bad is your ex. She can stew in it.\n\nNTA", "I don't think people like that feel guilt or shame. She's mad because this blows up her crafted image and now she's gotta deal with fallout."]}
