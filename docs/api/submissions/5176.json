WIBTA?\n\nUPDATE: My sister got back to me and informed me to due to all the donations they received they went over quota. Because of so all the Marines that volunteered were given permission to take gifts home to their family. I think she over exaggerated the actual value of the toys as she is prone to do so.

Highly unlikely they would let one person, even a Marine, take over 1k of toys. It sounds like one of two things is happening:\n\nThey took far more than they were allowed and are trying not to get caught now that you're asking questions\n\nOr\n\nThey bought the gifts themselves and are trying to pass them off as coming from toys for tots. I find it hard to believe that someone would donate a $500+ Lego set instead of multiple less expense toys.

Because of so all the Marines that volunteered were given permission to take gifts home to their family.\"\n\nthat just does not ring true (your sister, not you!).   OK so there was a quota for Toys for Tots - so why was the excess not donated to an orphanage, children's hospital, care facility?

If they have an over abundance, why not donate the toys to hospitals, daycares, or schools? Nta, but your sister doesn\u2019t seem trustworthy."]}
