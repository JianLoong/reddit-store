She\u2019s always been a bigger girl & I\u2019ve stuck up for her all throughout elementary school & middle school before I had to move. \nWe lost connection back in 2009 & reunited in 2015. I had just gotten out of a long-term relationship & had gained a massive amount of weight. \n\nI started getting serious in 2020, I got a personal trainer and started learning about health and fitness. I have hypothyroidism & pcos so the weight was harder to lose and took much longer.  Cara would do the fad diets and quit them as soon as she started them. She\u2019s 5ft9 and almost 400lbs.\nSo about mid- Spring I reached my goal & had lost over 50 pounds. I\u2019m 5ft8 & started at 220. I still had a spare tire but other than that it was a dramatic difference. My dating life turned around. People were just nicer to me in general. I had a better mood & was doing better at work.\n\nThe trouble started when I started inviting Cara to go to the gym with me because she wanted to get fit before her wedding this Fall. If she was the one driving to the gym, I would only have to expect a 35 minute workout which was about almost a quarter of the time I would usually spend. I\u2019ve taken myself back to the gym after she\u2019d drive us home to get my car. She would always be so angry as to why I wanted more time at the gym. When we\u2019d get back to her place she would order a pizza & would get mad when I wouldn\u2019t eat  food with her. I\u2019d explain that I\u2019m not spending all this money on an endocrinologist just to ignore the diet they set up for me. We finally agreed that I could bring my own food & we would go work out in separate cars that way she wouldn\u2019t be stuck waiting for me, and I could get my workout in.  \n\nIt finally reached a boiling point last week. We decided to meet at her house to go to the gym and she was in a foul mood when I got there. Apparently she went to the doctor and he told her that she had gained 15 pounds within the last 2 months. I put my salad in her fridge and turned around to her staring at me with her arms folded. I asked what was up and she started crying and saying that I had an eating disorder and that it\u2019s changed the dynamic of our relationship. I\u2019m going to have to go back in to get my bridesmaid dress tailored and now I\u2019m too self absorbed and obsessed with my weight to watch tv with her. She went on and on about how disgusting my body must look with an eating disorder with my loose skin. After she said that I just quietly said \u201cand you think that you *don\u2019t* have an eating disorder?\u201d \nThat\u2019s when she blew up on me, calling me fatphobic and how she\u2019s probably the healthiest person in the house. Her sister and brother are also very obese as well. They came out and only heard her side of the argument mostly because she wouldn\u2019t let me get a word in to explain. She told me she didn\u2019t want me in her wedding unless I apologized and gained 15 pounds.

It is about building NEW habits as opposed to just following a fad diet. \n\nYour friend isn't there yet, hopefully someday she will be for her own health but until then there is nothing you can do.  Honestly, it sounds like jealousy that you are finding success without recognizing the work you are doing.  It does seem as though she has a binge eating disorder (not a medical professional so I don't know for sure).\n\nI would consider not being involved in her wedding a win.  Anyone who would ask you to sacrifice your own health and progress and accuse you of having an eating disorder isn't someone you want around you.  Don't let someone hold you back over their own jealousy. \n\nFinally, CONGRATULATIONS on your success and hard work.  It is HARD especially with PCOS and Thyroid issues.

No matter how much you desire friendship with them, they don\u2019t like themselves nearly enough to have a successful friendship. She will always be comparing herself to you.\n\nI\u2019ve had girl friends do this to me for a multitude of reasons. I\u2019m a competitive bikini bodybuilder so the majority of time it actually has been over body issues and self esteem. Other times it has been over money or material possessions.\n\nAn insecure person will always feel threatened by someone they feel has more than them in some way and does not have the capacity to maintain a friendship.

I'm all for body positivity and whatnot.  But I can't endorse self destuctive behavior just to make someone else feel better about their own self destructive behavior.

She was attacking you for the very thing she wishes she could change about herself. Your pointing out that she has a problem may not have been the best time to do it in the heat of the moment, but you can\u2019t be expected to take the abuse without pushing back.

I know I need to do something about it (and I am).  It's not on anyone but me.  I will probably never look super hot again and I really don't care, all I want is to be able to go hiking again without feeling like i'm dying.  I don't compare myself to other people, it's about how I feel.", "NTA.\nYou don't need that negativity in your life, OP. Your long history of friendship has no value if she cannot be supportive of you right now. That is not real friendship. It's obvious your progress is too confronting for her and she's trying to hold you back. Good on you for keeping up your healthy habits and losing that weight!", " NTA at all. She is jealous of you and is trying to sabotage your earned results. \n\nI\u2019ve been in your position, although in a different situation, and it hurts, but you have matured and grown in so many ways past her, and the time has come to cut her loose. I have nothing good to say about her behavior, she owes YOU an apology.", "NTA. Lol what kind of friend orders you to gain 15 pounds?? Time for you to make like it's 2009.", "NTA. Your body, your choice. You are dieting and exercising under the care of a health professional. You don't need her to agree with you. She needs to respect your choices. You only mentioned her weight after she attacked you. Personally, I think you've put up with enough strife already.", "NTA, she responded really awful & lashed out", "NTA and congratulations for losing all that emotional weight from your ex-friend in one afternoon. If she is unable to see how badly she is hurting herself and others, then it is time to end the relationship. Plus the audacity to tell you to ADD 15 pounds... umm.... not for me thanks.", "NTA.   Some people you cannot help.  They need to figure things out on their own.  Unfortunately, that may be the end of this friendship.", "NTA.  Congratulations on your weight loss journey. I'm sorry your friend is too jealous  To be happy for you. And she's trying to self sabotage both of you.", "HI OP,\n\nNTA.\n\nI think you chose the wrong friend to invite to the gym. She's not on the same page with diet and exercise as you are so I would keep that side of your life separate from her as much as you can.\n\nThere's clearly some issues she's got going on with mental health, food, weight, etc if she's had a history of obesity along with her siblings. Maybe she's unaware of the influences behind her eating habits maybe she is but can't reach a readiness to change point in her life. \n\nShe actually might not even realize her views on bodies are scewed\n\nShe got caught up in her feelings and lashed out. It's sad your friendship is taking a huge hit to it. Weddings seem to ironically end relationships. \n\nHopefully you guys can work through this but if not I think in time you will both be fine.", "NTA. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, you said nothing wrong, and this is coming from an overweight woman myself. \n\nYour friend is having a meltdown, period. No reason to dive in to it further. She is unhappy with herself, she got bad news about her own reality from her doctor, she is angry, she lashed out at you. \n\nNo you are not going to gain 15 pounds for her wedding. No it doesn't sound like you have an eating disorder at all. None of what she says has a hint of rationality to it. \n\nThis is one of those moments that you just walk away and try and clear your mind of the entire conversation. Think of it this way- if a random person who looks unwell yells vile things at you on the street, it upsets you, but you don't spend time pondering if what they said had any merit. You realize they are unwell, you leave it at that. Your friend is unwell at this moment, she had a little break from normal because she isn't handling her own struggles well. She us upset about her own body, that she gained weight, and that her friend is doing what she can't do. It feels unfair to her. But none of that has anything to do with you. \n\nForget everything she said to you, it isn't based in reality. If otherwise she is a good friend, give her time to cool off, and you can try to reach out and just say \"I'm sorry you are struggling, I'm here to support you.\" See what she says, and if it is any way polite or nice, you can maybe move on with her, but hold firm to the fact that you aren't gaining weight, she will not at all comment on your diet or body, and should apologize for what she said about you.", "NTA\n\nYour friend's behavior has become toxic. I'd reach out to her, and ask if she is serious about not wanting you in the wedding. Leave it at that, it's what she told you, the ridiculous stipulations don't even deserve addressing. Don't get drawn in to toxic behavior. \n\nIf she dismisses you from the wedding, I think you know it's time to lose connection with her again. \n\nRegardless of where the relationship goes, she's a poor gym partner, and you should move on  to solo or go with another friend.", "Wow she sounds poisonous! She's jealous amd the worst kind. The kind that is miserable and wants company NTA she's not a good person to have around", "Wait a second, did you say this heifer is four hundred pounds? Are you being facetious, or are you being honest when you say this. That's a minimum of three average sized (depending on our definition of average size) women that she is equal to.
