It was peak hour and no one was driving real fast and the car in front of my had stopped semi-suddenly but definitely no one slammed on brakes, I even had time to look up at my mirror after coming to a complete stop to see the car smash into me.   \n\n\nI'm 35m and the driver was a 19f and her BF who I assume is about the same age, for some reason he was going off at me like it was my fault. We pulled over and once the boyfriend calmed down I was talking to the driver and we exchanged information which included each of us taking a picture of the other persons drivers licence thinking this was the easiest way to do it and I had to get to work so I was rushing a bit. I wasn't angry or anything I was quite calm and I did tell them that I clearly had to stop because the car in front of me had come to a stop. She also admitted that it wasn't my fault. She told me she had insurance and gave me the company name but said she had trouble pulling her account info up on her phone.   \n\n\nAbout 5 days later she messages my phone and says that she actually realized she doesn't have insurance (meaning she always knew and just lied to me) and that she was upset that she would now have to pay for my repairs and hers. My car is a SUV and wasn't too badly damaged as she was in a sedan and really just dented in my bumper panel.  \n\n\nShe then started getting angry at me via text saying that its unfair that she has to pay for my repairs and that I shouldn't have made a claim through my insurance because I won't have to pay anything and she will have to pay everything and that Its bullshit because I \"Knew she wouldn't be able to stop in time\", which makes no sense because I braked when I needed to.   \n\n\nAfter I replied in a civil matter and just advised her that she will need to sort it out with my insurance company and that regardless of how hard I had to hit the brakes she should have been paying attention and should have been at enough distance to stop in time. She then sent me a picture of my licence as a threat basically stating she knows where I live. I reported it all to the police and they called and gave her a warning so I hope that's the end of her abuse to me.   \n\n\nI know I haven't done anything wrong at all but I also suffer from severe anxiety and other mental health issues that always make me think I'm somehow doing the wrong thing. This girl has a small child and is obviously very young with not a lot of money given her car was old and not a good car. Even though she treated me horribly and is absolutely at fault for the accident I can't help but feel bad for her copping the whole cost of repairs for her car and mine as I know its going to hurt her financially probably for years.", "created_utc": 1676549730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113p8i9/aita_for_letting_a_young_mother_pay_in_full_for_a/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to be made whole and have your damages corrected.  Her single mother status is not of your concern.  NTA", "NTA this is why you pay for insurance. Let them deal with her crazy. You shouldn\u2019t talk to her at all anymore.", "NTA.\n\nOf course we all feel compassion for any person in this tough spot, but she absolutely was at fault in the accident.  But it's not fair for YOU to have to pay out of pocket or have your rates go up due to her negligence. \n\nSince she has no insurance, she will most likely not bother to repair her car except to replace the headlights if damaged. Your insurance will pay for your repairs and \\*try\\* to get her to reimburse them. \n\nIn the end it will be up to your insurance company whether to take her to court to make her pay.  It sounds like there was no police report so their case is good but not a slam-dunk.", "NTA\n\nYou did everything right in the situation, its her fault not only the accident itself but also the handling of it. She has a boyfriend who can help her out, given that he's probably the father of the kid anyway.\n\nGood for you for not cracking under pressure tho!", "NTA.\n\nAs for her, well, to quote a common saying on this website: the dildo of consequences rarely arrives lubed.", "NTA\n\nNot your fault she had no insurance and was a poor driver.    She should pay.  She should have a ticket also for driving without financial responsibility.", "NTA. But I also understand your sentiment about her financial situation and you're right, it's gonna hurt. Perhaps her reaction was just a defense mechanism knowing she can't afford the whole cost. If based on your assessment it wasn't too badly damage, you could make her pay half.", "NTA. Time for a lesson of taking responsibility and dealing with the consequences of your actions (@the 19f).", "NTA\n\nThis is a very young person who doesn\u2019t understand how the world works on several different levels and is testing you. Everything you\u2019ve done is spot on.", "NTA\n\nFile a police report for the accident and the fact that she says she doesn't have insurance and is threatening you.\n\nFile through your insurance for your damages.", "Not sure what the conflict is. I don't know where you are, but in many places it's illegal to drive uninsured, and the person who rear-ends another car is usually liable. If you feel bad about getting your car fixed with her money, then don't do it, I guess.", "NTA. She was at fault in the accident, she was driving unlawfully without insurance, she lied to you in the first place about that lack of insurance, and she's been behaving aggressively when you try to handle your accident in perfectly normal, responsible ways. \n\nAll of those are on her, not on you. Leave the question of who's going to pay what to your insurance (she probably doesn't have enough to pay the bulk of it, but that kind of thing is what insurance is for in the first place) and the question of managing her aggressive behavior to the police, and move on with your life. You aren't doing anything wrong.", "NTA,", "NTA \n\nIt was her fault, she needs to zip it and pay up. Her circumstances aren\u2019t your business.", "Ugh that was dumb on her part not to carry insurance \ud83d\ude23 my mother wouldn\u2019t even allow me to drive without insurance", "NTA she drove poorly, caused an accident and it's her own fault.", "NTA As she should have bought insurance.", "NTA \n\nHowever the amount of times you mention that you were civil and calm make me wonder exactly how civil and calm you are. \n\nPeople who are civil and calm rarely feel the need to mention that", "NTA. All this and more is why in most states it's illegal to drive without having auto insurance, which was her responsibility and decision alone. You made the decision to handle the matter outside police intervention, which was a risk. There is a reason it's important to do that, too. However your insurance company isn't unhappy with you. The police aren't unhappy with you. The person who rear-ended you is unhappy with you. Well that's what conflict does, it makes people angry. Put it out of your mind.", "NTA isn't it illegal to drive without insurance????", "Ummm most definitely NTA. SHE caused the accident, SHE choose not to have insurance, SHE is acting abusive & threatening due to her own negligence, and SHE should be responsible for whatever happens here, both from the accident itself and her threatening by towards you. Don\u2019t feel bad, SHE put herself in the situation she\u2019s in. Now she needs to accept responsibility!!", "NTA this is quite literally why insurance exists, and why in most places, it\u2019s illegal to drive without it.", "NTA. It's not your fault she was driving without insurance. Maybe this'll be a lesson for her to get some?", "She\u2019s not going to pay you, but that\u2019s what your insurance is for. You most likely have uninsured/underinsured coverage on your policy. \n\nBut no, NTA at all. And I would document that call you made to the police, and also pass that info along to your insurer.", "NTA. In most jurisdictions I know of, the driver that rear-ends is always at fault, except very specific circumstances (e.g. if you back up into them). No matter how hard you brake, the onus is on them to always be alert and keep a safe distance. Her trying to pin any of that blame on you is ridiculous and childish.  \nOn top of that, her lack of insurance is her problem, not yours. You did the right thing by calling your insurance. And you definitely did the right thing by reporting their threats to police. Hope they learned a valuable lesson that they need to take responsibility for their actions and can't strong-arm others as they please.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are not responsible for the poor life choices of others.\nIn my country it is automatic responsibility for the driver who failed to stop.\n\nYou are not responsible for her lack of insurance and for her living situation. She has to work out a payment plan of sorts to take care of her mistakes. It's a hard way to learn that insurance is not that expensive compared to full responsibility. And it was a small accident with little damage. Imagine if it had happened to her at higher speed and the other car was destroyed and driver injured. She will not be making that mistake again.", "NTA. Not sure what country you\u2019re from. If the US, never ever leave a scene of an accident without calling a cop first. Yes, it will make you late for work but that\u2019s worth it. Even if you are at fault! Beside, my experience is that engaging with the other party is not a good idea at all (aside from checking from their well-being right at the time of the accident). There is a reason why there are cops and we pay so much for insurance\u2026 finally, it is neither your or the other driver\u2019s role to decide who is at fault.", "I would document that call you made to the police, and also pass that info along to your insurer.", "NTA.

She was driving poorly (without insurance), which resulted in an accident, then opted for the route of threat and aggression when she is clearly at fault.", "NTA. She chose not to pay for insurance. That in and of itself is illegal, and now she has to pay the price. She should thank her stars she didn\u2019t hurt anyone, pay up, learn the lesson, and move on. After getting insurance on her car.", "NTA. You owe her nothing!!!! Muahahahah", "Absolutely NTA. Her situation and sob-story have nothing to do with the fact that she damaged your vehicle and did not do her part of being a responsible driver driving with insurance.", "NTA, driving uninsured is a crime (in my country, no idea about yours but I assume it's the same). Also I know my insurance will cover me against damage caused by uninsured drivers, so maybe just make the claim on your own insurance and leave her to deal with her own repairs.  As for the threat about knowing where you live, you've already involved the police there and hopefully that will be the end of it. You've done nothing wrong, the blame is all hers.  Unfortunately the tiniest bit of inattention can lead to a lot of expense, and she's responsible for her own actions. Maybe she'll pay more attention in future, it's an expensive lesson for her but could have been so much worse.", "NTA\n\n  Idk where you live but in many countries (in europe at least) it's illegal to drive without an insurance. Leaving that aside, there is a thing called safety distance. You can't drive too close to the car in front of you. You never know what could happen.", "NTA, also, when you file your claim with your insurance, if she doesn't pay, the insurance company will sue her. So she's paying regardless.", "NTA learning lesson for her.", "NTA.\n\nYou're being very nice here, even when she's being an asshole and doesn't deserve sympathy. You certainly can go through your own insurance, but I'm not sure why she would think that saves her anything - the insurance company will absolutely go after her to recoup the costs since she was at fault.\n\nKeep being you, please, this world needs more nice people.", "NTA. She's learning a hard lesson and she doesn't like it but that doesn't make you an AH. \n\nIf you find it too much to deal with with your anxiety you could bow out and retract the claim. HOWEVER, really think about how that would make you feel about yourself in the long run. It might make you feel benevolent but it might also make you feel like you didn't respect yourself enough to stand up for yourself / like you let someone take advantage of you, and that wreaks havoc to your selfesteem.", "NTA.\n\nThe accident was her fault.\n\nHer & her boyfriends behaviour since the accident is disgusting and a clear sign that you should not be feeling bad!", "This", "finally, it is neither your or the other driver\u2019s role to decide who is at fault.", "It's illegal to drive without insurance in the UK.", "Fair enough, I was more mentioning it specifically because her boyfriend was aggressive and abusive and threatening so I was just setting the scene that it wasn't back and forth I just tried to do the right thing and be the nicest I could be.", "Unfortunately OP still has to pay his own deductible.", "True, but I doubt he\u2019s going to see this from the other driver."]}
