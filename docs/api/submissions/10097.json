We pulled over and once the boyfriend calmed down I was talking to the driver and we exchanged information which included each of us taking a picture of the other persons drivers licence thinking this was the easiest way to do it and I had to get to work so I was rushing a bit. I wasn't angry or anything I was quite calm and I did tell them that I clearly had to stop because the car in front of me had come to a stop. She also admitted that it wasn't my fault. She told me she had insurance and gave me the company name but said she had trouble pulling her account info up on her phone.   \n\n\nAbout 5 days later she messages my phone and says that she actually realized she doesn't have insurance (meaning she always knew and just lied to me) and that she was upset that she would now have to pay for my repairs and hers. My car is a SUV and wasn't too badly damaged as she was in a sedan and really just dented in my bumper panel.  \n\n\nShe then started getting angry at me via text saying that its unfair that she has to pay for my repairs and that I shouldn't have made a claim through my insurance because I won't have to pay anything and she will have to pay everything and that Its bullshit because I \"Knew she wouldn't be able to stop in time\", which makes no sense because I braked when I needed to.   \n\n\nAfter I replied in a civil matter and just advised her that she will need to sort it out with my insurance company and that regardless of how hard I had to hit the brakes she should have been paying attention and should have been at enough distance to stop in time. She then sent me a picture of my licence as a threat basically stating she knows where I live. I reported it all to the police and they called and gave her a warning so I hope that's the end of her abuse to me.   \n\n\nI know I haven't done anything wrong at all but I also suffer from severe anxiety and other mental health issues that always make me think I'm somehow doing the wrong thing. This girl has a small child and is obviously very young with not a lot of money given her car was old and not a good car.

She hit your car, it's her fault, and TBH if she doesn't want to deal with being an adult in the world she's going to have to not hit other people with her car. \n\nHowever, you really, really need to get a police report if/when this ever happens again. That's an official third-party account that takes out some of the \"he said, she said\" of it, and officially establishes many of the particulars for insurance to deal with. You say you \"had to get to work\"... next time, just be late, and if you get written up for being in a crash that wasn't your fault, protest to HR.", "I mean she doesn\u2019t have to pay you especially if she\u2019s poor.", "$20 says it's the boyfriend behind the girl's phone.", "Thanks yeah I have put in my claim and everything and its all going through so I shouldn't have to deal with her any more and I'll just get my car fixed", "And this is why no matter how minor the accident is you always get a police report. Because I used to have insurance that unless there was a police report they wouldn't cover any damages whatsoever unless I wanted to claim as an uninsured motorist claim and have my rates skyrocket", "That and driving without insurance is illegal (at least in the US).", "It\u2019s illegal in the US too", "> NTA. Not sure what country you\u2019re from. If the US, never ever leave a scene of an accident without calling a cop first. \n\nThere's a caveat to this: if the accident happened on private property, there are no injuries, and you don't feel threatened they won't ever show up and might tell you as much when you call them.", "That's a fantastic saying haha", "Thanks this is a great comment, I keep thinking could I possibly have had something to do with it at all somewhere but I keep reminding myself that it doesn't matter if the car in front suddenly SLAMS their brakes on you MUST be at a safe distance and paying attention to react and also stop safely.", "In the us it is.", "If the claim is retracted the insurance co may think it was made fraudulently, I would never do this it might cause problems with your insurance", "They should have called the police and had them document the accident.", "My mom was like that. It's the result of being broken down by people yelling at you.", "Hah hah hah suggested you each pay for your own damages, you got to be kidding me man", "Yep I've blocked her number and won't be dealing with her any more.", "How do you figure? The court stipens her pay checks.", "I\u2019ll see you and raise you $20 lol", "This is actually 100% what I thought especially the threat I was thinking thats definitely him thinking hes intimidating me.", "I'll take that bet. It's totally the girl.", "Good. I'm a legal secretary. There's a saying in law: if it's not on the record, it didn't happen. Your only option was to get the truth on the record with all the necessary parties, including insurance. You are not responsible for her bad driving or lack of insurance. If she didn't learn to shape up now, next time, she could hit a pedestrian, and the results would be A LOT more serious. NTA", "Please do not feel bad for the driver that hit you. She chose to drive an uninsured car. It doesn\u2019t sound like she was taking due care and attention whilst driving. She is the master of her own misfortune, and needs to understand that some actions bear consequences. Hopefully she learns some life lessons as a result.", "If you rear end someone you\u2019re automatically considered at fault", "It's not illegal in Virginia and New Hampshire. You can pay $500 to Virginia and be waived of the requirement, but you're still liable in case of an accident. And New Hampshire doesn't require insurance as long as you pay out if you cause an accident.", "Depending on the jurisdiction. In many places, no deductible if the other driver is at fault.", "Depends, many plans have a deductible waiver as part of uninsured motorist coverage.  Mine does, as did the plan I had years ago when I was rear ended.", "Plus now he has a insurance claim so rates will probably go up...", "That\u2019s not true under most policies even if the other driver is uninsured, if they\u2019re at fault. I should know it happened to me TWICE", "It is, but depending on the state the fine is low enough that some people would rather just eat that when hit with it than pay their insurance. Then you have the opposite problem where in states where the fine may be super high but the requirements on the insurance are laughable, shit like only requiring 15k/25k property/injury liability only. Which covers only the smallest of fender benders and injuries.", "It's illegal in the US as well", "Also illegal in the US every state", "Ah, possible! So don't do that :-)", "This isn\u2019t really a fatal mistake though it was a rear ending the liability is clear and they exchanged documentation w photos", "Right? He also changed his number after insurance contacted him, and then texted me from his new number pleading with me to not go through insurance. I was like, claim has been filed \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and then sent insurance his new number.\n\nThat and you purposely gave me false insurance info. Asshole", "She has a boyfriend who can help her out, given that he's probably the father of the kid anyway.", "It's stupid of whoever did it, since now there's an obvious written threat from them. But accident reports from the police include full names, addresses, license numbers, and insurance policy numbers where I live. So, they would have had that info about you no matter what.", "Honestly I think that's stupid.  A person can injure someone so badly the costs could go into the millions, but there's no recovering that from an individual.", "Correct, I didn't pay a single cent.", "My sister got rear ended under similar circumstances (guy was texting and driving and just drive straight into her when she had been stopped at red light for a solid 30 seconds, I was in the passenger seat).  She didn't have to pay anything.", "Small claims court", "Huh I didn't know that. Because I see so many posts about drivers not having insurance here I just assumed it wasn't illegal in all the states.", "All good I have absolutely no intention of retracting it, you're right I wouldn't respect myself if I gave in like that.", "They didn't exchange insurance. And as you can see all of this would've been avoided if they got the police involved at the accident. OP wouldn't be getting harrassed, bullied, and threatened.", "It happened to me too. I rear ended someone and he didn\u2019t have damage, I did. I felt absolutely horrible but guys in the car next to me were throwing French fries into my car to get my attention at the time. He gave me the name of his insurance co but no acct info. A week later I got cced on a letter saying that since he applied on the date of the accident it wasn\u2019t valid until midnight. So basically after I hit him he went home applied for insurance and tried to report the accident. It didn\u2019t even matter for him as he had no damage but I thought it was odd he committed fraud when I was at fault. I still baked him cookies and brought them to his base because I felt bad. \n\nIn hindsight I guess he probably did that because he was a service member and was driving around with no insurance, maybe he thought he had to cover his hide.", "Not worth it for a little dent. Plus doubt you'll be able to squeeze much from that stone; she's 19 with a kid so is probably broke af.", "Filing fees would probably be close to the deductible, depending on what it is. For instance, I have an old policy that has a $50 deductible. Small claims in my area cost $200 (about 15 years ago) because I did file against someone. So in my instance, the juice would not be worth the squeeze. Others\u2019 mileage may vary. \n\nBut yeah, small claims is always an option.", "The police won\u2019t even come in California unless it\u2019s serious, she got a photo of the license that\u2019s really all you could do out here.", "\u201cLittle dent\u201d can be thousands. We\u2019re just talking a deductible here, as OP has insurance. I\u2019d do it as a life lesson bc girl and her bf have a bad and entitled attitude.", "Sounds like a her problem. She can do a payment plan", "$15 here in NYC if your claim is under $1000. $20 if it\u2019s over. Worth it and I\u2019ve done it.", "No doubt she was a little S%@! about it. Just not sure if it's worth OPs time and effort to teach her this lesson through the courts.", "Wow that\u2019s definitely worth it. I\u2019d be suing errrybody. \n\nI just checked my old file and it cost me $285 to file a $1500 claim back in 06.", "Wow! Crazy!!", "In NY it's big business to get into minor accidents and sue for fake medical."]}
