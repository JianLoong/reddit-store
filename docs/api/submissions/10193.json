She refused to have an abortion or give the babies up for adoption even after the father told her beforehand he wanted no kids and wouldn't be involved. She told him that she would raise her kids with or without his help. \n\nK will often complain about how tired and stressed out she is, almost every single time we talk. I've been woken out of my sleep more than once because she feels hopeless, or she is scared, or she is tired or whatever. The last time this happened was about 2 weeks ago. \n\nLast night K called me crying and screaming into her pillow. I heard crying in the background and she started going on about how she can't get them to stop crying and she's stressed out. I was tired and was going on almost 24hrs with no sleep before I was asleep. All I wanted to do was sleep, and couldn't care less about the problems she created for herself. \n\nI told K to stop complaining 24/7 because she had an opportunity to not be in this situation. She got upset and said all she wanted to do was vent and we started arguing. I told her she needs to deal with it and stop complaining because that's what being a parent comes with and she chose this life. She hung up on me and my girlfriend woke up from the arguing. My girlfriend then yelled at me because if I'm not going to help her with her kids I can at least listen to her cry. Was I wrong?\nEdit- a few things I forgot to mention. 1) before the 2 weeks of no complaints she would call me nearly every single day of the week, It would be a miracle if I could get through a whole weekend without it. 2) me and my sister do not have a good relationship 3) I used to live with my sister and she would constantly ask me to babysit, even if I had plans. Even though we don't live together now she would constantly ask to come by whether I was busy or not. I've babysat before but she will yell any time I do not agree.\nAnother edit- I lived with my sister from 5 months pregnant to when the twins were 4 weeks.

Too many tragedies start out this way.", "NAH bordering on ESH. Your sister needs some professional help. Telling her she made her bed and has to lie in it isn't helpful, but somewhat understandable as she doesn't seem to consider whether she might be burdening you too much.\nYou guys should have a constructive talk about her future with these kids, and set boundaries within which you are able to help out.", "Sigh. Lotta people are going to have a visceral reaction to this, but I get it OP. I had a cousin who got pregnant as a teenager, and became a single mom. She knew how tough it would be, and there is a limit of how much complaining I\u2019m willing to listen to about it. She made the choice to have unprotected sex, she made the choice to carry the pregnancy to term, and she also made the choice to become a single mother instead of pursuing alternate routes. Having a baby is fucking hard man. Having two babies at the same time sounds like hell for a 20 year old. NTA, because you\u2019re also a human being who has needs and needs to sleep. \n\nBut it does sound like your sister desperately needs help, if you can find a way to support her. Maybe scheduled calls during the day, instead of the middle of the night?", "NTA. Nah man, have your girlfriend take the calls if she feels so strongly about it. Your sister made her bed, she's going to have to sleep in it. Take the calls when you feel it's right, but you need to have boundaries as well. You have a right to your time and sleep. If she needs someone she can always find some kind of therapy or professional help.", "NTA. \n\nIt's harsh, but this was the very predictable outcome of her choices, and you are not obliged to be her punching bag just because she's stressed. If your girlfriend wants your sister to have someone to listen to her cry, your girlfriend can pick up the phone and let you sleep.", "NTA because no one is looking at the underlying issues. Your sister made the choice to have the kids alone, she is calling or talking about it incessantly including repeatedly waking you up in the night, and now you\u2019ve been woken up after a 24 hour day so you\u2019re inevitably going to be irritable. I can appreciate the difficulty she\u2019s going through but it doesn\u2019t mean you need to be inconvenienced. \n\nThe comments that she might be suffering from post peril depression are the most important.

You get to set boundaries and be burnt out. \n\nMaybe you lashed out, but in all fairness as the childless person in my family I also wouldn\u2019t want to be involved this deeply in my sister\u2019s drama. I made the choice to not have kids very deliberately.

People go LC and NC for reasons.  NTA", "Yikes. \n\nNAH \n\nYour sister needs support and you need rest.", "NTA, but you need to mute your phone at night.  Nothing is going to happen that needs your immediate attention.  You are losing too much sleep and aren't able to be your normal kind self.  Apologize to your sister for being rude concerning her choice in keeping her children, but tell her you are unequipped to help her with her issues and that she needs to find another confidante to discuss her child-rearing difficulties.  It is very hard to raise children, especially twins, but this isn't your issue.", "YTA and a major one at that. 6 weeks with twins is a PRIME time for postpartum depression. You basically told her to shut up when she needed to talk to you as a safe confidant. \n\nYou need to apologize and urge her to go talk to someone far more qualified than you are... and HOPE she forgives you if you want ANYTHING to do with your sister or niece/nephews. \n\nYour lack of empathy is really disturbing. I cannot think you could honestly have had a worse response to a struggling new mother. Why do you hate your sister so much?", "yta\n\nbabies are 6 weeks old, she did not call you last 2 weeks. so clearly she is not complaining 24/7. YTA,  no one remotely sane  says you shoyld have had an abortion towards the mother of 6 weeks old children.", "NTA.    It's incredible to me that people who make bad decisions, and your sister seemed to make a lot of them in this scenario, seems surprised when they get bad results.    You could be more sympathetic, of course, but you didn't make this scenario, and you did your best to prevent it once you knew what was coming.    \n\nLike it or not, she needs to make sure the father is involved, at least in the area of financial support.", "As you mentioned in your post, she had multiple options to not be in her current situation. She needs to deal with it herself and not expect others do listen to her cry about the consequences of her own actions. NTA", "> I told K to stop complaining 24/7 because she had an opportunity to not be in this situation.\n\nYou... told a stressed out new mother she should have just had an abortion? And reminded her that you told her so?\n\nYTA YTA YTA", "INFO - Have you expressed to in those prior incidences that you dont like being called up late at night for her to vent to? \n\nIf so and she still kept pushing it despite your request than NTA. You have no obligations to be her go to for venting as, yes, she made this choice. \n\nHowever, if you haven\u2019t communicated your frustrations prior to snapping at her during this particular call than its a light YTA", "YTA \n\nYour young sister is clearly suffering from postpartum depression. She has two, not just one but two, 6 week old babies at home crying wanting  attention and that\u2019s stressful to deal with, especially if she\u2019s doing it alone. Of course she is going to need to talk to and vent her frustrations to a trusted person. That\u2019s healthy. Do you think that parents don\u2019t complain about their kids? That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love them or regret having them. It simply means being a caregiver is hard. \n\nJust because you might have chosen an abortion doesn\u2019t mean she has to. That\u2019s what being pro-choice means. Why would you even bring this up here? You do not have the moral superiority to make others\u2019 choices for them. How absurd to act like you do. \n\nYou are her sister, her family, someone she trusts to talk to when she\u2019s struggling in life. The fact that the last time she talked to you about it was *two weeks ago*, tells me that you were absolutely the AH for unloading on her in her time of need and also that she clearly *doesn\u2019t* talk about it 24/7 as you said. \n\nIf you need to set boundaries, then simply make sure everyone knows not to call you after a certain time at night barring an emergency or put your phone on Do Not Disturb so your sleep isn\u2019t disturbed. \n\nYTA", "NTA. This is her problem. Literally will never be able to comprehend someone getting themselves into this situation and then not having the capacity to handle it and being surprised about it. HOWEVER she needs a therapist and she NEEDS a support system. She needs to get connected to local resources and single moms advocacy groups. She sounds like she has postpartum depression. She is your sister and if you do love her, she needs the support. That doesn\u2019t mean babysitting and that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re expected to stay awake 24/7.

You don\u2019t have to be the one who takes on responsibility for her or her babies but you so need\nTo be realistic with her. This is a tough road and as a mother it is her job to get those kids what they need and to provide as much in the way of resources as she is able to. That means going to court and getting child support from the father. It means contacting his family to let them be a part of their lives and give them that side of their families identity. It means getting on WIC or state assistance to make sure they have the nutrition and access to healthcare. It means that she needs to develop a support system and a babysitting or day care pool. And it means she is going to have to complain less and do more. Give her your ear but limit the times that you are willing to take her calls because you need sleep too. If she is dangerously affected she needs to call a crisis hotline. If she isn\u2019t she can wait for your hours.", "Ik im going to be downvoted but NTA your not her therapist your her brother.", "YTA, Yes I do think its not healthy your sister calls you on inhumane times. But she needs help.\nShe's young and she shows signs that she can't handle it anymore. What if she hurts the kids in a moment of desperation? \n\nI'm not sure what kind of help there is. But can she get help from you, family or a social worker maybe?", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s an adult and if she needs support she doesn\u2019t get a right to interrupt others lives for her problems.", "NTA\n\nShe chose to have the kids.

She clearly doesn\u2019t need you piling on her anymore than the shit she\u2019s already dealing with. It also sounds like your sister is incredibly stubborn, not ready for child rearing but went through with it anyways.

You're not making sense.\n\nShe's calling you and reaching out to you because she trusts you. She's not expecting you to do shit but listen. You whole post is off-putting. Your attitude and the way you speak about your sister is downright disgusting. \n\nShe wasn't alone in bed making those children but she stepped up for them.

Even parents who were actively trying to conceive, are in a relationship with the other parent, and only have ONE child are still going to do exactly what your sister is doing here. You not wanting to be in contact with your sister is one thing, but you going off on her like this is gross.", "Yta she called 2 weeks ago, and then today.  So she isn't complaining 24/7.

Also, mute your phone if you don't want calls.", "I understand you were tired - but she has baby twins that are just six weeks old.\n\nShe could have post natal depression - which can be dangerous for her and the babies without treatment and support - and even otherwise she is running on no sleep, her hormones are all over the place, her body has been through the wringer and this is a huge transition \n\nLots of parents talk about how tired they are. Lots of parents - even those older than your sister, those with one baby instead of twins, those with an involved partner or another adult - struggle and need to vent to get rid of the overflow of emotions so they can function having gotten that out \n\nOne day you might be a parent in the same place. I hope you are treated with more compassion and i think you should offer your sister some too.", "YTA. Looking after one baby is hard as f... Looking after two is even harder. And no matter what ANYONE says, no one and nothing prepares you for the tiredness and complete mindfckery that comes with newborns. So you'd be completely oblivious to it unless you already had a child previously. It becomes all consuming and it's hard to talk about anything else for a bit.\n\nHave a little bit of compassion. You aren't responsible for her choices, but you could handle it better, all she wanted to do was vent to somebody. I think you could have a discussion about when is appropriate for her to vent to you, but I couldn't imagine being this way to any of my siblings.\n\nBe patient with her, she likely needs an ear to just listen and for someone to say \"oh yeah, that's really crappy for you\".

I get her wanting to vent, but bed has been made, it must be lain in (lied in?).\n\nAs for you - if a new mom is screaming and crying, that's not a time for a lesson - it's a time to evaluate. Is the crying out of petulance, or is it something more? Whether she needs mental health support or physical support, she needs support and it's time to figure it out, for the babies' sake if not the sister's.

Maybe your sister would not have been able to handle the psychological load that having an abortion can do to a woman. So great, she's not calling you about the babies anymore, but maybe she would be calling about any guilt or shame she could be feeling. The father absolutely should be held liable and at least contribute financially. You said this happened last 2 weeks ago? You aren't her therapist of course, but she's obviously desperate. Like another user said, put your phone on do not disturb. She's clearly drowning, but being scolded doesn't help anyone here.", "YTA. Your sister called you to get some emotional support.

She told him that she would raise her kids with or without his help. \n\nK will often complain about how tired and stressed out she is, almost every single time we talk. I've been woken out of my sleep more than once because she feels hopeless, or she is scared, or she is tired or whatever. The last time this happened was about 2 weeks ago. \n\nLast night K called me crying and screaming into her pillow. I heard crying in the background and she started going on about how she can't get them to stop crying and she's stressed out. I was tired and was going on almost 24hrs with no sleep before I was asleep. All I wanted to do was sleep, and couldn't care less about the problems she created for herself. \n\nI told K to stop complaining 24/7 because she had an opportunity to not be in this situation. She got upset and said all she wanted to do was vent and we started arguing. I told her she needs to deal with it and stop complaining because that's what being a parent comes with and she chose this life. She hung up on me and my girlfriend woke up from the arguing. My girlfriend then yelled at me because if I'm not going to help her with her kids I can at least listen to her cry. Was I wrong?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

With all that being said I do understand that it's not your life not your job and you are losing sleep because of kids that aren't yours.

Even when you want kids, and you educate yourself on what to expect, a first time parent can never be ready for the true reality of it. So it makes sense that she'd be overwhelmed and need to vent to her support network. However, disrupting other people's sleep, or trying to make her problem, their problem isn't OK. She made an adult choice and needs to handle the adult repercussions of that choice. You were completely within your right to call her out on this and she's creating disruption for your life and also your GF's. However, reminding her that she could have aborted or gone the adoption route was pretty harsh. A firm setting of boundaries to not call in the middle of the night may have been a softer path to take before going off on her like that.", "YTA. \nBut at the same time, this is a really shitty and heartbreaking situation.

As does your response.\n\nIf you want this person out of your life, that's one thing. But if you don't, then sister, friend, doesn't matter: if you're trying to have a relationship with someone, then one might expect some empathy during what is possibly one of the most challenging stretches of her life.\n\nYelling at you for not babysitting and such is not great. Expecting people to shoulder your burdens with you kind of belies a relationship that may or may not exist.\n\nAre you friends? Do you want to be in this person's life in the future? Forget the blood relation part for a second: is this someone that you love and care about?\n\nIf so, then now is the time to step up and show some empathy.

I dunno, buddies?\n\nIf you're not friends, you don't love and care about this person, and you're trying to get away from your family (or just her), then ESH but it's difficult: cutting off those ties can be hard to do, but it really is on you to cut contact.\n\nNo judgement: I cut off contact with most of my family - most everyone that I knew as a kid - as the PTSD makes it extremely difficult to have those relationships. I don't personally feel like biological links matter *at all* when it comes to family. You don't have to love and care for someone just because you share some DNA.\n\nBut on the flip side: if this girl is your family, if you love and care about her, then please try to be understanding and compassionate.

She's a person too, OP. Try talking to her directly. Sure it was wrong of her to constantly bother you about it, but in the end she's still deserving of basic decency.

I guarantee if that were the approach there would be a lot less pent up stress and complaining, and you could be seen as a sister and not a place to dump all her complaints.  I know you think that she had a chance to not be in this situation, but she may not have had as clear of an option than you think.  Sure she could have used birth control, but maybe she did and it failed, I don\u2019t know.

For all we know, she could have chosen to abort and then called you crying every night with stress and regrets instead.

How is she eating? Did her doctor recommend any vitamin supplements?\n\nI could add a gentle YTA because it sounds like she's in a dangerous place mentally and you don't have the time and energy to help.

I would offer to take the baby for an afternoon or evening, so she could take a break, but she'd always give some excuse why she couldn't. I even went on one of my off days, told her to pack a bag for the baby, because I was taking him for the afternoon, after she had called whining about how tired she was. I told her to just spend the afternoon catching up on her sleep & I'd bring the baby back after dinner. She called me every half hour, wanting to know when I was coming back.

When the baby isn\u2019t with you, you feel immense guilt and fear that something could be wrong with them or that they are crying for you and need you but you aren\u2019t there.

There are other ways to help, and you absolutely don\u2019t have to do these things, but if you are looking for ways to help a new mom: \n\n-Asking to come over with no judgement to help them pick up the house or prepare a meal and straighten up the kitchen for them\n\n-Bringing them a meal you prepared because they probably aren\u2019t eating as much as they need to\n\n-Offer to drive them to their next doctors appointment and wait with them\n\n-Watch the baby (at her house) for a little while so she can shower and eat \n\n-Listen with empathy and ask if there\u2019s anything you can do to help. Sometimes just listening and reassuring that they\u2019re a good mom is enough\n\n-Ask if they need you to pick up a grocery order, or run an errand to take some of the responsibility off of them this week \n\nNone of these things are your responsibility, but if you believe that it takes a village and you want to do something truly helpful for your friends or loved ones\u2019 mental health while they are caring for a new baby, these things can go miles further than taking the baby for a day or weekend.", "Everything you listed about the sisters struggles is exactly what OP was warning her about when they suggested abortion or adoption, but sister chose to keep and raise them.

I was once a fetus so am I not allowed to advocate for abortion rights?", "Fairness to the parent is completely irrelevant to child support. A lot of the law isn\u2019t fair, and isn\u2019t trying to be. A judge would laugh his entire ass off if a father came in trying to argue fairness.

So when we're pregnant, we have an obscene amount of hormones flooding the body.  As soon as the kid and placenta pop out, the body is like \"we don't make the hormone anymore? The hormone that's been in your body for nine months? Neato!\" and then it just stops. It causes insane mood swings.\n\nThat's just the bottom level on PPD, the typical baby blues. However, for a lot of child bearing people, it fucks with your mental health hormones. Then you can't get out of bed, or you're constantly weeping, or you have passing thoughts of offing yourself or the kid. It might just be a fleeting thought, but it triggers so much guilt and then the weeping starts again. And for some it goes into a much darker place, like post partum psychosis. That's not an enjoyable Google search.\n\nYes, your sister made a choice. But motherhood, especially early motherhood, is just fucking hard. Little sleep, if she's breastfeeding, she is leaking, and these babies are brand new. She is ultimately feeling lost. She wanted to vent.
