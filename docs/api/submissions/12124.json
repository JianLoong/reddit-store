For days we were pressured into changing the names that we decided on to the names my parents wanted. I finally put my foot down and said no. This is our child and we will name it whatever we decide to name the baby. About a month passed and we found out that our baby is going to be a girl. For privacy sake let\u2019s call her Jessica. Jessica was the name that my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to go with because it just felt right. However my parents insisted on calling her Jasmine because it\u2019s stuck in their heads. Every time they call her Jasmine I repeat here name is Jessica. This was an everyday occurrence up until the day my baby girl was born. Now that she is born and on her signed birth certificate it says Jessica there is nothing my parents can do. However they still call her Jasmine. I\u2019ve recently gotten into an argument with my mother over it. She said that yes her legal name is Jessica but I will call her Jasmine because that\u2019s the name that is stuck in my head. I told her no her name is Jessica, you cannot call her a name that is not the one we gave her. I explained to her that she can call her any nickname or pet name she likes. But she will not disrespect me as the father of my child by calling her the name that SHE wants and not the name I have given my child.

Even if they did my parents already had my name ready. It\u2019s the same thing with my little brother. She didn\u2019t tell anyone his nam until he was born because she knew people would call her crazy for it. They did so we all just call him by his middle name because he prefers that.", "She is still around because we live with her. I\u2019m planning to move out because it\u2019s becoming an issue. I want to be a better man for my family and I will.", "We argued about this last night. It\u2019s as if everything I said to her went in one ear and out the other. I can\u2019t even say anything without her interrupting. It\u2019s gotten to a point where I walk away. But when it comes to my daughter I won\u2019t stop until they understand.", "Oh! Now that's a fantastic idea! When she goes and visits and uses that name, put the puppy in her arms or in her face!", "I said that if she is okay with it when she grows up then I can\u2019t stop her but until then it\u2019s her name or no name.", "They did not name me and they most certainly wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity.", "Or Jessica can call them \"the grandparents I never see\".  \n\nWhat a stupid hill op's mom is choosing.", "I was thinking of some worse names.", "Happy to help, Gladys!", "Lol this is the first I\u2019ve ever read someone else use the name Philbert- that\u2019s the name my daughter gave our dog haha", "Is your dad George Foreman?", "Ehhh, your mental health is not cheap, moving out is going to be more expensive but you might want to consider it with how terribly they're acting.", "It may be cheaper money wise, but at what cost to your mental health? This is not normal behaviour and you really should consider the effect it's going to have on your wife and baby, and yourself.", "Do you have your own space in the house? Any time they call her Jasmine, take her into your room and say, we can try again later when you remember her name is Jessica.\n\nAnother tactic, start asking them to get tested for dementia or other memory loss diseases since they can't even remember the name of the granddaughter who lives with them. \n\nThird, especially if you know they wouldn't like it, say you are looking at places to move because you don't want your daughter confused and you and your wife's decisions as parents disrespected.\n\nYou've got to find a way to set some boundaries. Like yesterday.", "I just want to point something out. Your daughter is going to get confused with people calling her two different sets of names. And it\u2019s not like one of them is a nickname or a pet name. Your parents are calling her an entirely different name to be spiteful, because they didn\u2019t get their way.\n\nFormation of identity and a sense of self is very important to a child\u2019s psychological well-being, and begins from birth. What your parents are doing is not only disrespectful to you and your wife, it\u2019s also unhealthy for your child\u2019s future psychological well-being. \n\nMaybe you can explain this to your parents. If they really care about what\u2019s best for their grandchild, they would not be doing this.", "> I realized it wouldn\u2019t help anyone with moving out so soon.\n\nListen, I know this is going to be hard to hear, but...\n\nYour mother is controlling and manipulative. This insistence on naming *your* child? Calling the baby by the wrong name? This is abusive.\n\nYou have a baby now. You are the parent. You get to decide if your child grows up in an abusive home. It absolutely would help to move out sooner. Before your infant gets old enough to understand what Granny is doing.\n\nI'm not saying run out the door this second and go be homeless, but I am saying... it's absolutely worth a bit more financial strain to plan to move out much earlier than you'd originally thought.\n\nThis is *not* a good home situation for you or for baby.", "It\u2019s lazy or manipulative\u2014 maybe both. And neither is okay.", "Even if they did, it would be a tall order for them to expect your wife just to hand her in-laws the right to name her own child!\n\nYour parents are tripping!\n\nNTA", "Until you move out get something like a bib and literally write \"Jessica\" on it. Put it on your baby whenever your mother is around. Tell her it's to remind her of your baby's name. Once you move out enforce increasingly long periods of no contact every time she uses the wrong name.", "No need. She's your daughter. Phooey on their opinions, you know?\n\nStay strong!", "Sorry to hear that, sounds like your parents are unrepentant hypocrites.  There's very little worse, in my opinion.", "Since Extraordinary I am fond of Jizzlord.\n\nSince finding out the star wars cantina music is literally called 'jizz' I am even more fond of it.", "Me too!", "I wish \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 no my dad is just your run of the mill narcissist", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
