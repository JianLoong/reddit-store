For days we were pressured into changing the names that we decided on to the names my parents wanted. I finally put my foot down and said no. This is our child and we will name it whatever we decide to name the baby. About a month passed and we found out that our baby is going to be a girl. For privacy sake let\u2019s call her Jessica. Jessica was the name that my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to go with because it just felt right. However my parents insisted on calling her Jasmine because it\u2019s stuck in their heads. Every time they call her Jasmine I repeat here name is Jessica. This was an everyday occurrence up until the day my baby girl was born. Now that she is born and on her signed birth certificate it says Jessica there is nothing my parents can do. However they still call her Jasmine. I\u2019ve recently gotten into an argument with my mother over it. She said that yes her legal name is Jessica but I will call her Jasmine because that\u2019s the name that is stuck in my head.

But she will not disrespect me as the father of my child by calling her the name that SHE wants and not the name I have given my child. She said that I am being disrespectful by telling her not to call her anything other than Jessica. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want her to give her a nickname or pet name.

Or just flat out ignoring them when they talk about baby wrong name.", "I would ask them who named their children? Were they allowed to do it or did their parents take that over as well?", "Less confrontational than Bogwitch and Jizzlord (nicknames of Gladys and Philbert) but equally as effective.", "We let people know our short-list but didn't tell anyone his name till we had him, mostly because we weren't sure but the kid fit the name liked best. He totally wasn't a Benjamin or Jacob or James.\n\nThough my very non religious in laws didn't like Jacob because of the biblical connections but we liked it and if he had looked like a Jacob when he was earth side it would be his name.\n\nI agree 100% on not telling everyone you have one name chosen and telling them what it is until the kids already here, then it's already their name and for MOST people to make any comment on it would be incredibly rude, obviously ops parents probably wouldn't care cause they're rude af.", "Here\u2019s a suggestion, make an insulting variation of your parents name to call them and use the same arguments that they do if they complain until they back off, an opposite gendered name (for eg Jessie becomes george ) can really get under their skin.", "It might help your mental health and to have a peaceful household. Sometimes that's worth every penny you pay.", "OP literally lives in his parents house", "I wouldn't start doing name tags or shit BUT the wrong name suggestion people have will probably work however a random name won't do it, to really dislodge this behaviour it'll have to be referring to your mum and dad and aunty second name and uncle second name. They will hate that and it will help with their little memory problems that are really just boundary string because you happen to live under their roof. \n\nWhich if you think about it, they probably do a lot of - treat you and wife like kids etc and while it's their house their rules step back from it and see if it's reasonable, I'd imagine this baby name issue is one of a long like of bullshit you and your poor wife have to put up with in the name of money saving.", "That needs to end quickly", "OP is the father lol", "This...this is the hill to die on. Tell parents and aunt..her name is jessica. If you call her ANYTHING BBUT JESSICA...you will not be seeing her again.", "Right?  If anyone is being disrespectful it is OP's mom. Imagine thinking you have the right to name your grandchild over the actual parents. The grandparents are absolutely delusional.", "\ud83c\udfafB-I-N-G-O", "LMAO \ud83e\udd23", "Not to sound mean but those are actions to be taken once he has a plan b in case he gets kicked out. Cause radical people like his parents tend to do radical and drastic things", "Thank you I appreciate that, I\u2019m working over time at work to save up just for that.", "You can know her and refer to her as Jessica, or you can not.", "It's bizarre. Half the fun of being a grandparent for most is that you get a new relative to help care for and spend lots of time with, without necessarily having to do the bulk of the work again or make the big decisions like naming them.", "Hey Jessica, these are your grandparents Bogwitch and Jizzlord. Oh, I'm sorry, those are the names I have stuck in my head for you. I ever so wish I could just change it. What's the name you call my daughter again?", "Legit piggy snort laughed at this! Thank-you for a much needed guffaw!"]}
