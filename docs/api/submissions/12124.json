From the moment my mother found out my fianc\u00e9 and I were having a baby she wanted to be very involved. Before we found out the gender my fianc\u00e9 and I already planned and came up with the name of our child. We picked out a boy name and a girl name respectively. Both names were rejected by my mom, dad and aunt. My parents wanted to name our baby. They said that this is their first grandchild and should have the right to name it. For days we were pressured into changing the names that we decided on to the names my parents wanted. I finally put my foot down and said no. This is our child and we will name it whatever we decide to name the baby. About a month passed and we found out that our baby is going to be a girl. For privacy sake let\u2019s call her Jessica. Jessica was the name that my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to go with because it just felt right. However my parents insisted on calling her Jasmine because it\u2019s stuck in their heads. Every time they call her Jasmine I repeat here name is Jessica. This was an everyday occurrence up until the day my baby girl was born. Now that she is born and on her signed birth certificate it says Jessica there is nothing my parents can do. However they still call her Jasmine. I\u2019ve recently gotten into an argument with my mother over it. She said that yes her legal name is Jessica but I will call her Jasmine because that\u2019s the name that is stuck in my head. I told her no her name is Jessica, you cannot call her a name that is not the one we gave her. I explained to her that she can call her any nickname or pet name she likes. But she will not disrespect me as the father of my child by calling her the name that SHE wants and not the name I have given my child. She said that I am being disrespectful by telling her not to call her anything other than Jessica. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want her to give her a nickname or pet name. I just feel like she is undermining my fianc\u00e9 and I decision to name our daughter.

The parents get to name the child.  Period.  If your parents can't respect you as the parent in the naming of your child, they will never respect any of your decisions on how to raise your child.

It isn't even about disrespect. It's all about your family's weird entitlement. What even is that? I say this as a grandparent.

At the first \"Jasmine,\" admonish GM and scoop up your bairn and leave the room/house. Give them a time out. Second time, a month of no contact. She will keep pushing if you relent.", "YNTA the only one (beside the child when its old enough) that have the RIGHT to name YOUR baby is you and your fianc\u00e9", "Why is your mother still around your baby???? Your mother does not get to see your daughter until she agrees to.call her by her name. If she \"slips\", she is then banned for a month, regardless of any more empty promises. Rinse and repeat until she consistently calls her by her name.\n\nYou WILL be an AH if you do not do this IMMEDIATELY. Your poor wife. Right now ESH except your wife and your daughter.", "NTA. Stuck in her head is no excuse for being wrong. Imagine it\u2019s a teacher or coach doing this? With the same excuse? Nope. Not okay and disrespectful. \nAnd you\u2019ve given the option for pet names/nicknames so you are not being unreasonable.

Oh and if your schedule is not too full I know Jessica would love some grandma time herself!

I don't know how it's not going into the grandparents thick skull that her name is JESSICA not fucking Jasmine. Obviously NTA but the grandparents have a weird obsession with the babys name.", "NTA. May I suggest calling your parents Gladys and Philbert instead of mom and dad because those are the names 'stuck in your head'?", "NTA at all. Supervise visits and correct them every time", "NTA. Set your boundaries, and if they continue not to follow them, start limiting contact. You sound very close to your parents, though, if you decided to let them name your child in the first place. But if you truly want them to change, setting boundaries and consequences is the only thing I can see working over time.", "Not sure what I'm reading here - never heard of grandparents getting to name their grandchildren. NTA, but this is seriously unhinged behaviour on the part of the grandparents. people are confusing... good luck.", "NTA But you are in a silly power struggle. You are going to win this because you are going to be the one filling out all those forms that determine what the rest of the world calls your daughter. If your mother wants to call her some other name, it's not going to change her legal name. If you can emotionally disconnect from this, I think you'll see what a weak position your mother is in here and just let her play her dumb game without raising your blood pressure.", "NTA", "What other things about parenting your baby is she going to ignore?  She thinks her grandparental rights outweigh your parental rights and she is going to push boundaries FORVER unless you hold the line.  You seem to have good boundaries but just be aware - she, your dad and aunt are going to keep pushing them.  And if she has your kid alone for babysitting, etc what will she be saying/doing/allowing/not allowing that you don't agree with?  Stand firm like you have been OP. You are not the asshole.", "So... does that mean your grandparents named you? Genuinely curious but I can guess the answer. \n\nNTA, obviously.", "NTA.  Is it possible to withhold your child for a month or two?  When your mom complains I would re-state that her name is Jessica and the use of any other name will not be tolerated.  Maybe easier would be everytime they call her the wrong name pick up you baby and leave while telling them to get it right or they won\u2019t see the baby.\n\nBTW, outside of really horrible / controlling people, I\u2019ve never heard anyone expect to name their grandchild.", "NTA - At. All!! Is there a cultural element here we are missing - why would anyone think they should be the one to name a grandchild? \n\nIf I were you I would NOT let Gma watch baby without you there - she isn\u2019t going to respect your rules either - like not giving her formula if you are breastfeeding, whether or not to use pacifiers. Or whatever parenting decisions you have made. Might even get her ears pierced, have her dedicated to a certain religion, etc behind your back.", "Hoo boy. My mother was the grandmother from he'll, taking after her mother who took after her mother... but even she didn't try to rename our children!\n\nFortunately you are the parents. You make the rules. (I hope you're you're not dependent on them for childcare!) The first time they pick her up, snuggle her close and coo \"hello, little Jasmine\" is the last time they see her for a while.\n\nI urge you to protect your child. I was not strong enough in defense of mine, and my tender younger daughter spent some time in therapy as an adult to evict my mad mom from her mind.\n\nGood luck. And congratulations!

Call them by made up names until they understand how annoying and disrespectful this is", "Nta", "I don't think this stops at your daughter's name. Your parents are going to insist on control over other decisions because she is the first grandchild. Stand your ground. Die on this hill.\n\nNTA.", "Troll level: Expert.", "Start calling your mom the wrong name. If her name is Mary, start calling her Mabel and just shrug and say that is the name that is stuck in your head. Do it publicly and often. Also correct your mom in front of others if she calls your daughter by the wrong name and add \u201cGranda seems to get confused a lot these days and may be losing her memory.\u201d\n\nMake it PAINFUL for her to continue he behavior."]}
