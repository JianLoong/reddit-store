From the moment my mother found out my fianc\u00e9 and I were having a baby she wanted to be very involved. Before we found out the gender my fianc\u00e9 and I already planned and came up with the name of our child. We picked out a boy name and a girl name respectively. Both names were rejected by my mom, dad and aunt. My parents wanted to name our baby. They said that this is their first grandchild and should have the right to name it. For days we were pressured into changing the names that we decided on to the names my parents wanted. I finally put my foot down and said no. This is our child and we will name it whatever we decide to name the baby. About a month passed and we found out that our baby is going to be a girl. For privacy sake let\u2019s call her Jessica. Jessica was the name that my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to go with because it just felt right. However my parents insisted on calling her Jasmine because it\u2019s stuck in their heads. Every time they call her Jasmine I repeat here name is Jessica. This was an everyday occurrence up until the day my baby girl was born. Now that she is born and on her signed birth certificate it says Jessica there is nothing my parents can do. However they still call her Jasmine. I\u2019ve recently gotten into an argument with my mother over it. She said that yes her legal name is Jessica but I will call her Jasmine because that\u2019s the name that is stuck in my head. I told her no her name is Jessica, you cannot call her a name that is not the one we gave her. I explained to her that she can call her any nickname or pet name she likes. But she will not disrespect me as the father of my child by calling her the name that SHE wants and not the name I have given my child. She said that I am being disrespectful by telling her not to call her anything other than Jessica. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want her to give her a nickname or pet name. I just feel like she is undermining my fianc\u00e9 and I decision to name our daughter. Reddit, Am I the Asshole for wanting my daughter to be called by her given name and not a name my mom wants?\n\nEdit 1: My family comes from Jamaica. My mom is Christian so I\u2019m not sure if faith has anything to do with it. I live at home with my parents so keeping my daughter away isn\u2019t possible at this moment. I love my parents and I want them to be in my daughters life. I have amazing grandparents in mine that have always been there when I needed them and I want her to have the same. My fianc\u00e9s mom called her Jasmine as well. No she did not communicate this to my parents it\u2019s just something that ironically happened. However my fianc\u00e9 told her to stop and she did. I will show them what you guys are saying.\n\nEdit 2: Moving out isn\u2019t an option right now. We are saving for a house and we are still in nursing school. Yes we could afford to live in an apartment but that would slow the buying a house process significantly. It\u2019s either I can move into a house or spend money on an apartment and recently the renting prices have doubled.
