Rotating mattresses that require it should be done to prevent sags, not to force the lighter person to sleep in a saggy spot.\n\nWhen you get the new mattress don\u2019t sleep in the exact same spot every night. Shift around. Some nights sleep closer to the foot of the bad. Some closer to the head. Some close to the edge, some closer to the middle. Try not to wear out one spot too fast. This is hard with zoned because of how the springs are laid out so different spots might not be as comfortable. \n\nAlso the zones are supposed to prevent sagging by having more springs and sturdier springs at the shoulders and hips. I personally find them super uncomfortable because of that.", "I agree it shouldn't be sagging after a year, but isn't it also regular practice to rotate or flip mattresses often to prevent any single spots from being over used?\n\n\nI rotate my matress(similar to op it's in not a flip able matress) about once a month to prevent any spot being over used. This also means any sagging spot moves to the foot of the opposite side of the bed so as long as it's not extreme it should not effect the other sides quality. \n\nI'm leaning toward YTA because you're sharing a bed with you BF but also making it seem like it's solely your matress and don't seem to be caring for his quality of sleep.

That's Tempur pedic you're talking about with the wine glass!\n\nAnd your issue is motion transfer.

I swear by it since I own it, but not everyone likes the feel of it and sometimes it's just not the right bed. It's better to try before you buy or else find somewhere that has a sleep trial.
