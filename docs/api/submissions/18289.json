You should make a claim under the warranty. Most mattress warranties are 10 years to lifetime.", "You have a terrible mattress if it\u2019s failing within a year. Check for a warranty and if it does not have one, invest in a good mattress for the sake of this relationship. Of course you shouldn\u2019t have to sleep in the hole created by him.", "Nta \nIf the mattress is only a year old I'd be contacting your parents, since you said it was a gift.  You will need the receipt to contact the mattress manufacturer for a replacement under warranty.  As most mattresses I know have a 5-10 year warranty.\n\n One thing to look at for the future is going splits..   so you can buy two different halfs and get different types of mattress for each of you.\n\n Think adjustable bed that the frames can be latched together but you can have a softer side for yours. And he could have a stiffer side for him..\n\n Being heavier myself I find I need a stiffer mattress so it holds up, and I just put a pillowor foam topper on it for softness.", "In terms of the actual question, NTA, but as others have said, that sounds like a really bad mattress if it's sagging after only a year. It shouldn't matter how much your BF weighs, they don't collapse that fast. You should definitely claim it under the warranty", "If it's sunken in after only 1 year, it's not a good mattress. If he wants a different sleeping experience he should buy a new mattress.", "NTA he should buy the new mattress if he doesn't like the one you have. You should also get a much better quality one bc no mattress should sag after one year. I'm guessing your parents didn't spend much money on it or got it from one of those shady dealers (there are a lot of them in the mattress world).", "NTA. Relationships involve compromise and sacrifice at times, but a straight 1-for-1 \u201cyou get comfortable sleep every night, I get shit sleep every night\u201d is dumb. No one\u2019s at fault here, just buy a new mattress.", "180 degree rotate, not flip. Should be every month or so. Seems too late now or a bad mattress.", "Matresses are personal items:\n\nThey need to be selected on wanting hard, soft, a lot of a little support, what kind of material, type of maintenance etc.\n\nThey also need to be adapted to your BODY WEIGHT.\n\nIt seems that your matress was destined just for you, and the fact your BF is also sleeping on it, was ignored.\n\nIt's only a year old, but with his weight, and the matress being sagged on his side, besides the lack of comfort, it could lead to physical problems and not being well rested.\n\nAlso, if you flip the matress, it will lead to the same problems within a year, and then both sides will be sagged. And for that year you'll be sleeping on a sagging side. Which isn't nice, AND it is YOUR matress.\n\nBest option is to get a new matress together, one which is adapted for both your morphologies.\n\nNAH", "NAH, but your mattress is really a terrible one. \n\nWhen I bought my new mattress I made sure it was one I could either rotate or flip upside down if needed. It did cost me more than I had originally wanted to spend, but it is worth it in the long run because being able to flip it has extended the life of the mattress.", "Well you're in a relationship and it sounds like it's time for a new mattress. If you want to be a compromise of partner you should suggest going half and half on a new mattress, or if your partner just doesn't take care of the things in your home together or he's just typically the one who's responsible for buying new things then suggest to him that it's time to buy a new mattress.\n\nYou're not the asshole but you should try to find ways to maneuver around such a small situation.", "Mattresses should be flipped and rotated on a regular basis so there is even wear (you must have a really soft mattress).  Anyway, try getting a good memory foam mattress topper.  The good ones are 3 inches thick with a 1 inch pad on top.  They run from $75 to $150 or so.  They will disperse his weight and spring back.", "NAH. You are supposed to rotate your mattress every few months to help prolong its life. If the mattress is less than a year old and is already sagging, it is a very shitty mattress and you should look into the warranty or get a new one. If you can't afford a new one, get a mattress topper. I can understand your boyfriend wanting a comfortable sleep, but by flipping the mattress that will affect your side and your sleep quality. You guys need to either replace the mattress with a good quality one or get a matress topper and see if that helps.", "NTA. There's no reason for you to suffer comfortability in bed.\n\nNormally the mattrass is supposed to be suitable for people up to 250 lbs... I guess your BF's heavy weight would mean he'll be way heavier than the less than featherlight weight of 90lbs. If your BF is lighter than 250 lbs, you might be succesfully able to invoke the guarantee. Otherwise, you could at least try. If it's not succesful, bad luck for your BF, but still you don't need to give up your nice half of the mattress. Next time buy a mattress also suitable for heavy people.", "Have him buy a new one. This argument is ridiculous.", "Flip it. Meaning turn it over so no one is sleeping on a sagging side because a sagging side would be facing down. And then get a new mattress, because clearly this one is deficient.", "NTA The mattress was a gift from YOUR parents. Why should you suffer through getting the sagging side that he created?", "More information.  90 pounds is only 40kg.  That is the size of a child.\n\nI would be looking at the warranty.  Only the cheapest foam mattress should sink that fast, especially for a child.", "NTA\n\nFlip it & let him sleep on your side.", "ESH. You're supposed to rotate them every couple months.", "put the mattress upside down, or just get him to buy a new one", "NAH since both sides are relatable.

Y'all got the wrong mattress - which btw should have been chosen based off the larger person between the two - and he no longer has support. If he wore out one side in 8-9 months, he'll wear out the other side in another 8-9 months and in the mean time y'all can save up for a new mattress based on his weight and not yours. \n\nI loved a man for 5 years who was 100 pounds more than me (mostly muscle). Beds/chairs/cars, etc. need to consider his size. Your size is easy to manage relative to his.....especially the mattress.\n\nEdit: I agree with others that HE should buy the new mattress in 8-10 months. Get a good one. Do your research. There are mattresses for heavier people now. Consider a Helix.", "Two issues: \n\nThe first is that no mattress should be sunken in after only a year. This sounds like a very poorly made mattress.\n\nSecondly, I wouldn't buy new furniture to benefit a boyfriend, unless he lives there and is paying his share. If he doesn't live there, he can go sleep in his own bed.\n\nIf he DOES live there, then it would be reasonable for both of you to go shopping for a new mattress. Because  even a Euro top mattress that isn't flipped should still get rotated. And if one side is sagged in, it's only going to get worse for both of you over time. Your side will start sagging too before long.\n\nThe answer here is not \"We should rotate the mattress so YOU are uncomfortable instead of me\", it's \"Let's replace this mattress with a better one that will wear evenly\" and then you stick to what the manufacturer instructions say. But again, only if you're living together. You are not obligated to drop hundreds on a temporary sleeping arrangement.", "NAH\n\nNo decent mattress should be sagging after just a year.\n\nThat said, if a mattress isn\u2019t rotated / flipped regularly, it will wear out unevenly.  The situation will only get worse, with one side wearing down and sagging more and more while the other does not.
