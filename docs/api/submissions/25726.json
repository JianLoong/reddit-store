She obviously thought you were closer and she values your support.   \n\n\nDepending on why they broke up really determines if you should have let her stay. If she cheated on your brother then kick her ass out and apologise to your brother, but if it just broke down naturally, then I don't see why it's an issue...Unless your brother is at yours often.", "NTA I'd imagine your brother hasn't offered to pony up for a hotel,  or you'd have mentioned it.  It's he legitimately suggesting you throw her out in the street?  What a piece of... work", " NTA Your brother was probably hoping that she would suffer when they broke up or that she would be forced to come back to him. Either way, you treated the gf with compassion. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA, I'm sure she appreciates it, and if I was a member of her family I'd breathe a sigh of relief knowing she has a place to stay for the time being.\n\nYour brother isn't making sense.", "NTA.

Why did you let her stay?", "That\u2019s a real dick move to kick someone to the curb after they move to a different city/state/country to be with you. You did the right thing, the honorable thing.

If she has nowhere to stay no reason not to let her unless she did something terrible to your brother or is a shitty person.", "NTA. So your brother thinks she should just be homeless? Pretty shitty behaviour on his part. You're just being a decent human being.", "NTA  I don't know where your brother gets that there is a \"siblings code\" bs.  His ex came to you as she had nowhere else to go and you did the decent thing by letting her in.  What did he expect her to do, sleep on the street or under a bridge?  It sounds like she has plans to return home and needs a safe place to stay until then.  You were kind to her when he was being a total ass.  You did nothing wrong.  Your brother sounds like a selfish, self centered person.  Do not feel bad for being a decent human being to someone in need.  Actually, you should feel good that you were able to help her.  He is the AH here.", "NTA. If it were my brother, I\u2019d be incredibly confused by the \u201cbro code\u201d thing he pulled out of his arse.", "NTA - If he broke up with her (and she wasn't cheating or stealing from him) then why would he care that she was staying with you?", "NTA. What, did your brother want her roaming the streets because \u201che didn\u2019t love her anymore\u201d?! What a *{{^{*{+]*{*{++]]+{head.", "NTA, you are just trying to help out. \n\nBut I also understand your brother not being happy about it. About a decade ago my brother and his then gf broke up after 7 years due to her lying and very possible cheating. She had turned into one of my best friends by that time and even though my brother said it would be ok to remain friends with her I didn't do it. Deep down I knew he would not be OK, but he would never deny me a friendship. At that point I decided to stick by him and I never saw or spoke to her again, especially because she hurt him very deeply. I am not sure how I would have reacted if she had needed a place to stay and showed up at my house. I guess it also always depends on how bad the break up was.", "NTA\n\nFrankly, your brother going on about \"sibling code\" and \"having his back\" sounds pretty toxic. But regardless of whether or not your brother is an asshole, the situation you're in is that his gf moved some considerable distance to be with your brother, and doesn't have nearby family or friends she can go to. Taking her in for a short time until she can make arrangements to return home is a good thing to do.\n\nYou don't say why she and your brother broke up. Perhaps if he came home early and caught her in bed with another guy, he has a right to feel upset with you for offering to put her up.", "NTA\n\nThere is a lot missing here, but based on the surface I\u2019m going to assume the breakup was her choice and your brother is counting on her isolation to force her back to him.  That\u2019s a lot of assumption on my part, but we are lacking details.  If this is true then you are not TA.", "Info : what wad the reason for breakup if it was her fault! Well yes you would be the ahole but if not As a Human perspective you did the right thing. \n\nHaving said that even if she was not at fault your relationship with your brother is toast.i hope for your sake she didn't cheat on him because there is no return for your relationship with your brother from that.", "I'd love to know how long OP holds out before things get complicated with the brothers ex. To me, this is absolutely the direction this is going, whether OP knows it yet or not.", "You\u2019re not really an asshole, but that\u2019s a weird thing to do", "NTA. I'm not sure why the brother would be torn without some extra component added. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: NTA based on confirmation.", "NTA. As Imchatterbox said, you're not picking sides. However, how long does it take for her to call a family member to come get her ?", "Info: did she do something really toxic to your brother (cheating, lying, abuse, etc?)", "You're not an AH but this has the potential to get seriously messy.  I would be looking to get her moved out ASAP.", "NTA for helping but things will get stressy & messy if she stays much longer.\n\nBuy her a ticket home asap so she can get support from her friends & family. If she protests then tell her to pay you back when she's got the money or that it's a gift & then step away from the soap opera.\n\nYour brother (while entitled to end the relationship) is an arsehole for putting her out with no money & nowhere to go.", "NTA. Sibling code is not sleeping with her. You\u2019re well within your right to assist her", "NTA - I was going to ask the same question regarding reasons. He broke up with her, kicked her out and left her with no place to go which is definitely an AH move. \n\nThat said, 1-2 months is a long time to house someone. My only caution is make sure you take care of yourself here and don\u2019t let your generosity get taken advantage of. Does she already have a way to get money and a solid timeline?", "NTA if she moved for your brother and has nowhere else, and he doesn't want her at yours, then he needs to cough up the money to get her to her family.", "NTA so long as there's nothing intimate happening between you and ex. Otherwise, you're brother is a jerk for breaking up with her and kicking her out when she didn't do anything wrong it seems.", "NTA. ESPECIALLY when your brother is the one that put her \"out in the cold.\" I'm sure it's just temporary - I saw a month or two? As long as she's got a concrete plan and it's not putting you out, I say you LIKELY won't regret being a good person. \n\nStory time: My cousin did something similar to his fiancee when I was in high school- she moved up here while he was deployed, made a home at his request including financing furniture, etc. Left her high and dry with SO MANY loans. I moved into my moms (his Aunt - her would have been aunt-in-law)  room for about 4-5 months while she lived in my room. She got herself together, paid off her debts and found a new job and apartment. She's a lovely person and my cousin, while I love him, it wasn't a good fit. They both moved on to have happy lives and I'm sure she'll never forget the generosity my mom showed - I know that I won't forget.", "NTA - She's isolated from her friends and family and you stepped up and helped her. Good on you.", "NTA\n\nMy mother went and picked up my ex from college when his mom couldn\u2019t, 3 or 4 months after we broke up. She attended his grandmother\u2019s service when she passed. They were still friends.\n\nThe two of them broke up, most of the time breakups don\u2019t actually have \u201csides\u201d. You chose to be decent, and let your brother know as a courtesy.", "NTA, you just helped someone who needed help", "Siblings code, lol. NTA.", "Sounds like your brother just smashed and passed her. Poor girl.\n\nGood on you for helping her. At least there's some good people in the world.", "Where does your brother expect her to go? On the streets? He's the AH. You're a decent human being.", "NTA", "NTA, your brother sounds like a really shitty person, he has every right to break up with someone he isn't in love with anymore, but he doesn't get to dictate who stays in YOUR home, from the comments I've seen he doesn't even seem to come over often anyways, so it wouldn't affect him at all, he just wants bad things for his ex for some reason, which really confuses me because he's the one who broke up with her, so he shouldn't be this bitter about it", "Let me guess... Mom is taking his side?\n\nSo NTA. Good job being a decent human being.", "Nta, Seems like a reasonable and nice thing to do.\nWtf does your bro want though, for her to be homeless in a strange city?", "NTA you are just doing the decent thing here .", "I don\u2019t think she necessarily thinks we\u2019re closer than we really are, I\u2019m kinda her only option you know?\n\nMy brother is the one who broke things off because he didn\u2019t loves her anymore and no he isn\u2019t, I\u2019m usually the one that go see him", "It\u2019s also a part of The Sibling Code that you\u2019re obliged to fart on them, near them, or in the doorway of their room at any opportunity.", "He didn\u2019t loves her anymore so he broke things off.\n\nBecause like I said, she has nowhere else to go and I don\u2019t live far.\n\nThe only friends she has are my brother\u2019s and they wouldn\u2019t take her in.\n\nAgain, she has nowhere else to go and don\u2019t know a lot of people so it\u2019s either that or she\u2019s homeless", "He\u2019s the one who broke things off because he wasn\u2019t in love anymore", "No he broke up because he didn\u2019t love her anymore", "Why would it get complicated with my brother\u2019s ex lol?", "Why did you jump to that conclusion? As it\u2019s not stated,  OP could be a straight F or gay M.", "I\u2019m a woman and not interested in her", "I'm baffled that there is even one YTA. You jumped to some weird ass conclusion considering the brother broke up with her after she moved away from everything and everyone for him.", "They lives hours away so she needs to gather money to buy a plane ticket. It\u2019s probably gonna be a month or two. I told her I was ready to give her some if needed", "No, he didn\u2019t love her anymore so he broke up with her", "Yes she does, she has a job, it\u2019s not much so that\u2019s why it\u2019s gonna take time before she has enough but her family already know and everything\u2019s settle for her come back", "Your brother is a bit of a crap human being.\n\nSo he wants her to be homeless, unable to get home?\n\nThat isnt fair or compassionate.", "In that case you did the right thing", "Oh, good point. Yeah, otherwise it'd be weird they were so offended.", "Ah, let me edit that then.", "Like why not just buy her a plane ticket probably cheaper than keeping her in your place for 2 months.", "A month or two??  That seems excessive.  I'd let her stay for like a week or a handful of days.  After that, she can drive, get a bus, stay at a hotel, they can come get her, whatever, but she needs to come up with a plan that doesn't involve you.", "That\u2019s unfortunate. No options for bus or train? Those tickets are usually cheaper, and it\u2019d probably be best for her mental health to get out of there ASAP.", "Yeahhhh NTA, the sibling code would only apply if she had done something to hurt him.  In this case, the human decency code is more important than the sibling code.", "I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t have enough money lol. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t spend that much time at home so having her there doesn\u2019t change a lot", "Unfortunately, bus or trains would take her days, they live in San Fran while we\u2019re in New York. \n\nShe honestly can\u2019t wait to go back, that\u2019s all she talks about lol", "Does she not have any money or a job? Did your brother refuse to let her work? \ud83d\ude33", "Ahhhh gotcha. That\u2019s unfortunate. I travelled across the US by train once and it was relaxing, but definitely not super quick. Keep an eye on Priceline and other discount outlets for tickets, you never know what deal will pop up!", "She stopped working when she arrived, she started looking again and she\u2019s currently working as a babysitter but it\u2019s not enough to buy a plane ticket. I don\u2019t know, he never expressed having issues with it so I don\u2019t think so", "Yeah, we make sure to check everyday, thanks"]}
