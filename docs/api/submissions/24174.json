This promted her to take a pregnancy test when we got home.\n\nI live with my parents for work during the summer while she's at home in a different city. She suddenly texts me \"I took a pregnancy test\" followed by \"We will have a baby\".\n\nRelevant info: GF has been on birth control for the last 3 years or so. We've talked about how we'd feel about a surprise pregnancy before this and have both said that we wants kids but not in the next ~10 years or so (we're both students). She's said that she'd get an abortion if the situation arises. I've told her that the decision is hers but that an abortion would suit my interests as well (again, if the situation arises).\n\nI call her immediately after receiving the texts. She enjoys pulling my leg from time to time so I'm not convinced she's actually pregnant but I want to take this seriously if she is. Therefore I immediately say something along the lines of \"I need you to be honest with me right now, no jokes or games, have you actually gotten a positive result on your pregnancy test?\". She responds \"Wow what a reaction, are you alright?\". I tell her that I'm alright although I've got some adrenaline pumping by now so my voice is kinda shaky. I ask her again, this time asking if she promises that she's gotten a positive result and she responds by saying that she promises that she took the test. At this point I'm more or less convinced that the whole thing is a prank since she's continuing to avoid my question while also making sure she doesn't outright lie on the call.\n\nAfter it's obvious that she's not pregnant I tell her that I didn't appreciate the prank and that I'm disappointed that my initial request of honesty and \"no fun and games\" wasn't enough for her to drop the act. She thinks I'm overreacting and is herself disappointed that I'm making such a big deal about it. She says that in the event of a pregnancy, almost all of the consequences falls on her (true). She also says that I know that she'd get an abortion in a situation like this so it was never like I had to consider actually having a child (although I'd never just assume that she'd get an abortion). Lastly, she said that she's been in a similar situation herself the last couple of days when she didn't know whether or not she was pregnant, and that she had to fear for a far longer time while also having more to fear (since once again, she gets almost all of the consequences). I should've been able to go through a lesser scare than she went through for a shorter duration of time.\n\nSo, AITA", "created_utc": 1691482121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lbmj6/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_she_was_out/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is because when a person is pregnant, their hormones change, their brain changes, and their mind can be changed too. Once a person knows they are pregnant, an abortion may no longer be an opinion to them even if they always said they would get one should the situation arise.", ">I should've been able to go through a lesser scare than she went through for a shorter duration of time.\n\nThat's an odd statement to make at the end.

It sounds like she isn't pranking you for fun, she's doing this to gauge your reaction because she hasn't been honest about her own feelings towards a possible accidental pregnancy. \n\nThat's likely because having an abortion can be a seriously traumatising experience for a woman. Have you considered that she's only agreeing to do so because you've made it clear that that's the only option that \"suits your interests\"?\n\nYou might be unnecessarily freaking yourselves out if she's on birth control, but ultimately an accidental pregnancy always falls on the woman - she has to decide between two life-changing options (keeping or aborting) which can be determined by her partner's reaction. This was likely a test she put you through to see what her future might look like.", "YTA.  And, most of the people on here are young guys who know very little.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
