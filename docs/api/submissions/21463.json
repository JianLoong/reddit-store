Sounds like a you problem and why the heck would you say something like that publicly on any social media!?!?!? Your son may see that one day which will cost you a lot in your relationship with him. Your issues with it all are already the reason it\u2019s no longer a co-parent relationship with your ex.", "Yta they\u2019ve been together 6 years. Move on from whatever hate it is your harboring and live your life. You don\u2019t have to like her or interact with her. You could just be cordial for your child.", "If you don\u2019t have anything to do with her then you\u2019re only hurting yourself to carry these feelings around.", "YTA. Your actions are only going to contribute to a hostile relationship and it will be your son who pays the price.

Are you sure you are 34 and not 14?", "Yta - she literally hasn't done anything to you or your son.", "YTA.  You are a bully", "More info is needed to truly make a judgment. Like what did she do for you to dislike her so much? Has it been a \"gut feeling\"? And how do you know she is genuinely being fake rather than trying for the sake of your ex and your child? Also, airing her dirty laundry on FB is not cool. Is it public knowledge she was abused? She may not want others to know that, and it is up to her who and when she shares that information. \n\nSo far, it sounds like YTA because you don't like her and have decided she is fake and wants problems, not because she had done anything. You have a right to dislike someone, but that doesn't mean that you can be rude to them, especially when they are going to be a permanent fixture in your family's life for the foreseeable future. Your son seems to like her. Maybe you feel threatened by her presence in his life? That's completely understandable and normal, but not an excuse to be mean", "Potentially YTA. The most important person in this whole drama isn't you, and it isn't her. It is your son.  What is best for HIM in this scenario? From  a young age he has had to deal with a mother who is not in his life on a daily basis and a woman who isn't his mother but is there most of the time. Poor little guy must be so confused...\n\nIf she is being fake, just accept it. No need to play her game but also no need to be the warrior and always try to confront her.  Probably best to go through your ex husband in all dealings about your son anyway. \n\nAnd get off Facebook with your personal issues. If you have something to say, say it to the person directly.", "YTA. You haven\u2019t actually listed a single bad thing she\u2019s done. You say she\u2019s fake, but haven\u2019t stated anything that indicates her sincerity is fake.

Not necessarily for refusing to make nice with her, but so many other things. You called her fake multiple times for things that sound like sincere efforts to me. You announced your intentions about her on facebook!? Please tell me you didn't include the part about her being abused!\n\nAs far as your actual question, please take a breath and figure out what's best for your son.

You do realize you are no longer in high school and should stop acting like a teenager?", "Maybe he started asking because he finally grew tired of your pushiness?  Yta.

It sounds like a you issue.", "Sounds like YTA based on this info.", "YTA why\u2019s you post about her on Facebook? That makes you the asshole supreme. People change, she might actually be nice now but you\u2019ll never know bc you\u2019ll never give her a chance. I feel sorry for your ex and son having to live with this drama", "Yta who even cares if she\u2019s being fake towards you, in the adult world being fake is called stepping up and putting your differences aside because non of that matters, what matters is that she is the gf of the father of your son and a part of his life. She probably hates you just as much as you hate her but she was willing to get over it and try to cooperate you need to do the same.", "YTA. I think you need to do some deep soul searching and get to the bottom of your obsession with your exes wife. You should be grateful that your son has a third parent that he loves and feels safe with, when it could be so much worse. \n\nYou\u2019re throwing a fit because he no longer let you walk all over him about his time with your guys\u2019 kid when he started dating her, is what it sounds like from your comments. \n\nHow embarrassing for you.", "YTA, this impacts your son. You don\u2019t have to like her, but you should play nice to improve your son\u2019s life and upbringing.

You can dislike her all you want. But you still have to be civil. \n\nYou are TA because you're being jealous and mean towards her and your ex. \nYou were never co-parenting. You were bossing him around and making all the decisions in your favor. Now that he has someone actually encouraging him to stand up for himself, you all of the sudden can't get along with your ex?\n\nGet over yourself. He has as much right to your son as you do. I'm glad he sees that now and puts his foot down more.\n\nAnd you should put your sm on private if you don't want lurkers, instead of putting her baggage publicly on display. You had no right to do that, that was terrible.\n\nYou need to grow up and actually co-parent.", "Publicly posting details of someone else's life is not the way to avoid drama, and you know that. You are the one causing problems here, not her, and it's sad you can't even be civil to someone so important to your son. YTA.", "Okay, I\u2019m not going to pile on here. Just looked at the comments, and you\u2019ve taken a few shots to the ego. Who does your anger and resentment benefit?  The external pressure seems to be pushing your ex and his wife/gf closer together. Maybe it\u2019s time to consider what this might do to your son.
