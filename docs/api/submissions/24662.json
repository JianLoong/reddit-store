After she told me, in front of our entire friend group, I need to \"stop calling myself bisexual\" and I need to stop being \"so biphobic.\" Because I keep personally identifying as bi, but am only sexually attracted to girls, while being sexually and romantically attracted to guys (and just more attracted to guys in general). We've been best friends since third grade, and this has been something she has continually told me ever since I came out in high school, when I was 16 (she literally flat out said, \"no, you're not,\" when I told my friend group I was bi).\n\nThis time, all of us (6 girls) were hanging out, and we just started talking about our relationships and things like that. I told them how I had a one night stand with this girl a few weeks ago, but didn't want to enter into a relationship with her, or anything like that.\n\nEveryone else was totally normal about it, except for this friend (who is straight, or at least AFAIK). Who told me I was \"fucking disgusting for co-opting bisexual identity.\" I asked what she meant, and she told me she was sick of hearing me say I'm bi, but never actually wanting to date a girl. I told her again, I'm sexually attracted to girls, but not romantically, so the thought of dating a girl is just not appealing to me. She called me a \"biphobic bitch,\" and said if I wanted to say I was \"half-aromantic,\" that would be fine. But otherwise, \"I need to shut my mouth, and stop being so biphobic. And stop calling myself bi.\"\n\nAt this point, I started crying, and she was like, \"Here we fucking go. Cry, so everyone can feel sorry for you.\" Which made me cry even more. And then I basically just screamed at her in front of the entire cafe we were all at. Told her she was a fucking asshole, that I'm so fucking sick of her, and I never want to see her again. She's been calling and texting me for the past few days, but I haven't been answering. My other friends say I need to apologize for humiliating her like that in public.\n\nI feel really horrible about screaming at her like that, especially in public. But being bi has been something I've been very insecure about my whole life. I've never felt like I should be \"allowed\" to call myself bi, or even see myself as part of the LGBTQ community. More just be an ally. And my friend has been kind of hammering that in ever since I came out.

You decide what your sexual identity is.  If you are sexually attracted to both men and women, AFAIK that means you're bisexual.

First of all it's none of her business what you label yourself as, because that's what it is, it's just a label that you're comfortable identifying yourself as.

However, I think what your friend is trying to get at here is that oftentimes, bisexual women who are not romantically attracted to women are.... well, a cocktail of misogynistic and homophobic, as they frequently don't view women as \"worthy\" enough to be romantic partners and see them as a \"fling\" that they can have before going back to a \"real\" relationship with a man. \n\nI'm not saying you're one of those people, but it stands that identifying as such is going to make people think that you have certain prejudices against other queer women/internalized biphobia. If you are one of those people.... I understand your friend. If you're not, then I think you just need to ditch your friend.

Does she have a brain? Lmao NTA", "You're NTA-- I'm definitely someone who thinks arguing exact terminological labels for people is ridiculous and that we should accept the term that people chose to use to describe themselves in terms of LGBTQ+ identities.\n\nThat said, I do want to say this is the first time I've seen anyone who isn't on the ace spectrum using the split attraction model and I have seen the split attraction model used wrongly in harmful ways some discussions about LGBTQ+ (but not Ace) people, so reading this left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. You're sexually attracted to men and women, that's totally fine... but IDK how I feel about the concept of declaring oneself not romantically attracted to one of the genders that they're sexually attracted to considering the social aspects of being LGBTQ+. Don't get me wrong-- I'm not arguing that you can't use the label you find most comfortable or that you're not bisexual. I just haven't witnessed anyone using the split attraction model who isn't using \"I'm only romantically attracted to one gender when I am sexual attracted to both/all genders\" as a bit of a crutch to avoid the real reasons they're choosing not to consider long-term relationships with some people? Like I've heard bi teenagers use it and then change their label later when they realize that it's not that they weren't romantically attracted to their own gender, it was the hetero-normative societal norms that made them not want to consider a relationship with some of the people they were sexually attracted to? That's just my experience though, and I will point out that's a chronically online experience and the people I'm referring to are ones I knew on the internet. I just find split attraction in general, outside of ace people, to be something that's hard to completely disassociate from the potential outside influence, if that makes sense? \n\nAgain, whatever label you're most comfortable with now is *valid* regardless-- even if you look back in ten years and think that you were wrong about your identity, that doesn't make it any less valid and useful of a term for you to use for yourself *now*. And if this is your true feelings, then I guess this is your true feelings and there's nothing wrong with that either. And you are *absolutely bisexual.* \n\nBut this discussion seems so... juvenile? to me? And I think that's why? Because I haven't met an non-ace adult who uses the split attraction model the way you do? And also because I think your friend's view that she has a right to chose the label for you-- whether she agrees with it or disagrees with it!-- is also very juvenile. Like very 2010 tumblr? She doesn't need to defend the label \"bisexual\" from people who she doesn't think it fits.", "Hello!\n\nOfficial warm, whole hearted welcome to the LGBTQI+ Community!\n\nGender / sexuality / attraction / what we want from relationsips / sex is ALL FLUID and VALID.

We're people - we dont fit into boxes or labels because we are too busy been all the colours of the rainbow, and all the colours in between!\n\nI exist completely outside of the gender box - my biology is female, and my strength is woman is how I explain my gender.

And actually its society that cares more than i do at this point.\n\nIm actually at this point of my life dont want a relationship with anyone (does that make me asexual? or just really comfy single?). In my youth I'd have called myself straight because although I was attracted to girls, Id spent my whole life been told I was a lesbian because I was a tomboy, I was only interested in dating guys. And thats all we really understood of it. All I knew was I was not a lesbian, but it took a lot of untangling of others input to figure that out.I also find I am not interested unless I feel connected.\n\nNow I'm probably into dudes like me - closer to non binary than anything.\n\nAm I bi? Well I'm not straight. Am I Pan? Maybe? Am I Non-Binary? sort of?\n\nHave I always thought and felt this way.. no - its all a journey.

You dont need a label, you are Sydney22_22 and that is enough. Your job is the be the best version of yourself that you can. Love deeply, have sex passionately. Be true to yourself, because you are worth it.", "Hmm I don\u2019t think they have to go hand in hand personally as I was asking a question based on my own experience. I\u2019m straight and only sexually attracted to women and only had romantic relationships and feelings for women. \n\nI\u2019m curious why someone could find be sexually attracted to a gender group but not want to seek a romantic relationship. I found their response interesting why they don\u2019t find it appealing.", "[removed]", "She thinks lgbt are pedos, I wouldn't give her more attention after this.", "[deleted]", "Hm I don't really know , it feels to me that every case where this happens is people not feeling romantically attracted to their own gender. I'd love to see the opposite, maybe then I'll believe it .", "It feels like being bisexual is a constant \"gotcha\" waiting to happen. I'm married to a man, but I'm also attracted to women. Being in a hetero facing relationship makes it seem like that other side doesn't exist to the outside world.", "I was actually just thinking about this, this morning, trying to figure out how I'd label myself and I think you hit it - demiromantic and bisexual. lol  I can't \"fall in love\" with people until I know them well.  But I can get hot for some time with guys and gals. lol \n\nNot that it really matters bc I'm and married to a man and monogamous, but brains are gonna brain.", "If you are attracted to your own gender and another gender, you are bisexual. Sexuality and partnership are separate. People accept that when a straight man marries a straight woman, he still finds other women attractive, right?", "no, it literally does lmaoo. if you are bisexual, and romantically into trans people it\u2019s nothing to do with the gender - it\u2019s nothing to do with the genitals even - it\u2019s inherently saying that the only reason you\u2019re not sexually attracted to them is because they are trans which is transphobic.\n\nagain, they may have a completely different definition of bi and pan to me personally, but the way that i took it is transphobic.", "Totally agree!", "It's called sexuality and everyone's is different. What you're doing is just shaming her for being sexually attracted to women but not feeling romantically for them which there's nothing wrong with at all.", "You're utilizing a false equivalence. For the unaware, this is a type of logical fallacy that involves incorrectly asserting two things are equivalent, that actually aren't. (You can and should look it up to educate yourself.) \n\nBisexuality refers to romantic or sexual preferences. With that said, sexual preferences in particular aren't determined just by *who someone would date.* For example, you might be sexually attracted to someone, but not like them as a person. Their attractiveness to you *physically* isn't cancelled out by their personality. \n\nEveryone has preferences for who they would date. OP being bisexual doesn't mean she has to date women, however, and suggesting it does (or else OP isn't bisexual) is discriminatory.", "That's not for us to judge.  Or comment on.\n\nAnd OP's (as well as yours and mine) preference is no-one else's business.  And to be honest, I personally don't give a rat's what you or OP decide to do behind closed doors in regard to sex and dating.", "That sounds like you have a problem disassociating sexual attraction from romantic attraction. It's not their fault and nothing is wrong with op for feeling that way.", "\\> Idk but now I have the question on why would you ever think a group of people are good enough to have sex with but not good enough to date.\n\nI get why you would see it like that, but that's not really how I've ever seen my sexuality. I'm not having sex with people who want to be in a relationship with me, but then telling them I wouldn't date them. I agree, that's cruel and disgusting. That's not what I'm doing, though. I'm just having casual sex with someone who wants to have casual sex with me and doesn't want a relationship either.\n\nAs for why I'm not romantically attracted to girls, idk. A lot of the times I feel like I'm just wrong. I'm too gay to be straight. And too straight to even be bi.", "Because we\u2019re not shown old happy lesbian couples when we\u2019re kids so we don\u2019t grow up idolizing those so we don\u2019t even think about it until we\u2019re older therapy usually helps a lot", "It doesn\u2019t matter, the way the \u201cfriend\u201d spoke to her was disgusting.  There\u2019s no excuse for that; this person is a bully and OP should steer far away from someone who mocks and belittles her for any reason.", "AFAIK means As Far As I Know.\n\nShe said AFAIK she is straight.\n\nWhy do you specifically think only a lesbian or bisexual woman would gatekeep bisexuality? I see it far more from whiny allies that think they're helping us by arguing with others who claim to be in our community.\n\nHaving sex with men and women as a man or woman is the MOST basic requirement to be bisexual because it means you wanted to have that sex with them. You don't even HAVE to have actual sex to still be bisexual. Because it's only sexual attraction.", "Shut up, dude. This is documented. All you have to do is spend two seconds googling. Leave OP alone. She needs validation,  not another person questioning her identity. No one cares about the opinion of someone who literally didn't even do the bare minimum to participate in the conversation.", "Look up split attraction for clearer answers", "we dont act like we\u2019re special, we just dont want to be erased or oppressed (which we are, btw). as i\u2019ve already said, being open allows others who feel unsafe to know theyre not alone. its a sense of community, friendship, alliance.", "It does not. Try somewhere LGBT folks aren't?\n\nPeople are fully allowed to verbalize their romantic and sexual attractions even if they don't align perfectly. \n\nIt isn't that because people are simply doing what they're free to do. Act on their attraction. Accept their own attractions.", "Brains are soooooo gonna brain.", "I don't think this follows. Would you tell a bi-romantic heterosexual woman that she's misogynistic because she's not sexually attracted to women?", "Could also be due to differences in our definition of transphobic? I understand transphobia as being hateful to or disgusted by people who are trans, at not seeing them as valid, not acknowledging their true gender, not supporting their rights or not seeing them as equals. Not being sexually attracted to someone who is trans doesn't fit in that definition, especially if they are genuinely supportive in every other way that counts. \n\nBut I'm not lgbtq and don't have personal experience to draw on, so might be out of my lane here.", "I'm just asking what's the difference because in every other case where someone will say I will have sex with this group but don't them we'll say that's kinda wrong. \n\n\nI'll use my example again if white men who will date black women but refuse to date them. Would you honestly support that and say that's ok because it's his preference or would we say that guy is an asshole. Leaning towards the latter", "I'm not arguing the definition of bisexuality. \n\nI'm saying it does sound a little messed up to say I'll have sex with this type of person but date no I can never do that.  \n\nI'm saying in any other case we would say that person is wrong. Why doesn't it count for gender.\n\nLet's not pretend there aren't white men who are sexually attracted to black women and then say well I can never date one.  We would all look down on that man. The only difference is race compared to gender", "I mean I can comment on it if I like right? All I'm doing is asking a question. If you think it's inappropriate or a question that shouldn't be asked you're more than welcome to ignore it and scroll by", "Oh no I get the difference. \n\nIm saying in all other cases we would negatively judge someone who would say well I'm sexually attracted to this group but I would never date them.  \n\nLike wouldn't you think negative of a guy who say he willing to sleep with a overweight woman but never date one. If his excuse is well sexually he's attracted just not romantic", "I mean doesn't matter to you because you have your opinion. I'm saying how I got to my opinion, so it kinda does matter, just not to you.", "I never questioned her identity did I you moron. You\u2019re too lazy to read the whole thread and instead respond on one section of it.

Hey me saying this could end up with less people being hurt.", "I'm not hurt, and I'm not speaking on behalf of OP.\n\nI'm just saying if you think it's acceptable to comment to anyone outside of this post and outside of Reddit on sensitive subjects, you're going to hurt someone if you're not careful.", "You didn\u2019t hurt anyone.
