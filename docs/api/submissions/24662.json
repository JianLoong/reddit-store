After she told me, in front of our entire friend group, I need to \"stop calling myself bisexual\" and I need to stop being \"so biphobic.\" Because I keep personally identifying as bi, but am only sexually attracted to girls, while being sexually and romantically attracted to guys (and just more attracted to guys in general). We've been best friends since third grade, and this has been something she has continually told me ever since I came out in high school, when I was 16 (she literally flat out said, \"no, you're not,\" when I told my friend group I was bi).\n\nThis time, all of us (6 girls) were hanging out, and we just started talking about our relationships and things like that. I told them how I had a one night stand with this girl a few weeks ago, but didn't want to enter into a relationship with her, or anything like that.\n\nEveryone else was totally normal about it, except for this friend (who is straight, or at least AFAIK). Who told me I was \"fucking disgusting for co-opting bisexual identity.\" I asked what she meant, and she told me she was sick of hearing me say I'm bi, but never actually wanting to date a girl. I told her again, I'm sexually attracted to girls, but not romantically, so the thought of dating a girl is just not appealing to me. She called me a \"biphobic bitch,\" and said if I wanted to say I was \"half-aromantic,\" that would be fine. But otherwise, \"I need to shut my mouth, and stop being so biphobic. And stop calling myself bi.\"\n\nAt this point, I started crying, and she was like, \"Here we fucking go. Cry, so everyone can feel sorry for you.\" Which made me cry even more. And then I basically just screamed at her in front of the entire cafe we were all at. Told her she was a fucking asshole, that I'm so fucking sick of her, and I never want to see her again. She's been calling and texting me for the past few days, but I haven't been answering. My other friends say I need to apologize for humiliating her like that in public.\n\nI feel really horrible about screaming at her like that, especially in public. But being bi has been something I've been very insecure about my whole life. I've never felt like I should be \"allowed\" to call myself bi, or even see myself as part of the LGBTQ community. More just be an ally. And my friend has been kind of hammering that in ever since I came out. I still feel like it's wrong to even say, \"I came out.\"\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1692057701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rbpth/aita_for_screaming_at_my_friend_in_public_because/", "score": 539, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're sexually attracted to your gender and another.  Romantic and sexual attraction are very different. For example I'm pansexual panromantic, but my bestie is bisexual panromantic. So you could ID yourself as bisexual hetero-romantic. AND THAT'S VALID AND OKAY.\n\nSecond, NTA.Change your circle of friends, she was the biphobic one and then dismissed your feelings, and your other friends enabled her. That's not a good group of friends to have. You have nothing to apologise for. Leave them, block them, and find a better group of friends.  \n\n\nETA: Thank you for the award.\n\nNow, I dunno why I was questioned about transphobia... myself being trans nonbinary. But neither being biromantic/sexual nor being panromantic/sexual makes anyone transphobic. Trans people are included in both orientations, nonbinary and genderfluid people are, too... I don't understand where the conflict comes from. If you don't consider a trans woman a woman or a trans man a man then THAT is transphobic...  \nAnd being POC I consider it an extreme insult to exchange the terms and turn this into a racial discussion when trying to understand the sexual vs romantic aspects. Why is it that heterosexuals can have one night stands but we LGBTQAPI+ can't? Why are we subjected to double standards like that? If a woman wants to have a one night stand or a sexual relationship with another woman (see here WOMEN, meaning consenting adults), but wants a more romantic relationship with a man, why can't she? Because she's from the Alphabet Mafia and somehow she's held to other standards...? Because one person ID's as a man and the other person ID's as a woman and that somehow is discriminatory...?\n\nIt probably sounds passive aggressive, but I really don't understand why the double standard about this. We still don't understand completely how attraction works anyways... I mean, as long as we all have emotional intelligence, act like adults, and aren't bigots about it...", "NTA - she\u2019s not your friend, and all these other people telling you to apologize for embarrassing her (when she was verbally attacking/bullying you) are cowards and aren\u2019t your friends either.  Friends shouldn\u2019t call you a bitch.  She\u2019s a nasty, rude, insecure, miserable person, and you don\u2019t need that in your life.", "NTA. You are the only one who gets to choose your labels. Your friend is an absolute AH for trying to tell you how you feel.", "- *another* huge fight\n- she has continually told me ever since I came out\n- \"Here we fucking go.\"\n- Who told me I was \"fucking disgusting\"\n- one of my best friends\n\nI suggest that you think about this list of snippets from your post and decide whether or not you think that the first four items are at odds with the last item.\n\nIMO This is a person who is in your social circle. This is a person that you have known for a long time. This is a person who may have, at some point, been your friend.\n\nNot sure what I'd call them at this point, but if this is a \"best friend\" you need to throw 100% of them out and try again.\n\nNTA. Sometimes people get emotional in public, that's just how it do.", "So?  It's alright for her to treat you badly and embarrass you in public, but you can't embarrass her in public?\n\nContinue on ignoring her calls and messages, you are a better person than her, only you know yourself, she doesn't.  It's alright to dump friends, you have obviously grown up and moved on.  Time to also think about your other friends too.  You need quality friends who know how to support you.", "NTA. You decide what your sexual identity is.  If you are sexually attracted to both men and women, AFAIK that means you're bisexual.  The dictionary dot com definition says sexually or romantically attracted to more than one gender.  Seems you qualify.  Why would you not be \"allowed\" to call yourself bi?  Why is your so-called-but-not-friend gatekeeping bisexuality so aggressively?", "NTA!! First of all it's none of her business what you label yourself as, because that's what it is, it's just a label that you're comfortable identifying yourself as. Also relationships come in different varieties so yes you can call yourself bisexual if your sexually attracted to women but don't see yourself dating one. You had every right to defend yourself and protect your peace, she was embarrassing you and belittling you in public in front of your friends and you had every right to defend yourself. Strong NTA!", "NTA at all! I consider myself bisexual despite being married to a man for 6 years. You know what's in your heart. I'm sorry she makes you feel that way", "NTA at all. She felt it was okay to step all over your identity and label you how she thought fit. That's not a friendly thing to do. She made you cry and then had the audacity to shame you for crying- when she caused it. That's not a friend. That's a bully and she deserved every little bit of what she got. Your life will be better without her in it.", "NTA - there's only one person that gets to determine your sexual identity, and that's you. \n\nyou don't need friends like that in your life.", "Only you get to decide who you are. Your friend is not entitled to decide that for you. \n\nYour friend is toxic and treated you like shit. I know it's hard but I wouldn't put up with that behavior another minute. If she can't love and accept you for who you are, and BELIEVE you about yourself, she doesn't get the privilege of being in your life. \n\nDon't stay where you're (barely) tolerated. Go where you're celebrated.\n\nI'm bisexual and married to a man, i know what bi erasure is and you're not the one doing that, SHE is. You are NTA.", "NTA. I heard someone describe your exact situation as being bisexual, but hetero-romantic, and that made a lot of sense to me.", "Elder bi/pan here with queer kids who are not quite your age but I hope you\u2019ll excuse a little mothering from someone who came out as bi in the 90s (and then pan when that seemed to fit better) and has seen all the bi erasure under the sun. Hon, you are NTA, and those emotionally stunted bullies and cowards you call friends neither have any right to tell you about your sexuality nor to call themselves decent friends. I know you want to hang on but they are holding you back. Cut them loose and let yourself be the full glorious bi person you are because life is terrible enough to our community as it is, it does not need your help in the form of keeping these wet rocks dangling around your ankles. Cut. Them. Loose. There\u2019s love and friendship of all kinds out there just waiting for you. I promise.", "NTA. other people dont get to determine your sexual orientation and publicly shit all over you for it, and then play the victim.", "By all definitions, you are bisexual. However, I think what your friend is trying to get at here is that oftentimes, bisexual women who are not romantically attracted to women are.... well, a cocktail of misogynistic and homophobic, as they frequently don't view women as \"worthy\" enough to be romantic partners and see them as a \"fling\" that they can have before going back to a \"real\" relationship with a man.\n\nI'm not saying you're one of those people, but it stands that identifying as such is going to make people think that you have certain prejudices against other queer women/internalized biphobia. If you are one of those people.... I understand your friend. If you're not, then I think you just need to ditch your friend. You two clearly disagree on a really big thing, and you're not compatible as friends. I think this friendship should've ended long ago.\n\nETA: Thank you for the reward! It's my first :)\n\nAlso, OP,  my girlfriend brought this up and I thought it was a really good point: I think it's important to consider what exactly you find romantically attractive in men, and if women could also feasibly have those traits. What is it about men that makes you feel you could have a romantic relationship with them, but not with women (when it seems you have never even experienced one)? Or is it more about a lack of experience with dating women and that men are \"easier\" to please? I'm not trying to call you out, I'm genuinely curious if you do have a concrete reason/experience behind not dating women or if it's simply something internalized you never learned to unpack.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Does she have a brain? Lmao NTA", "You're NTA-- I'm definitely someone who thinks arguing exact terminological labels for people is ridiculous and that we should accept the term that people chose to use to describe themselves in terms of LGBTQ+ identities.\n\nThat said, I do want to say this is the first time I've seen anyone who isn't on the ace spectrum using the split attraction model and I have seen the split attraction model used wrongly in harmful ways some discussions about LGBTQ+ (but not Ace) people, so reading this left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. You're sexually attracted to men and women, that's totally fine... but IDK how I feel about the concept of declaring oneself not romantically attracted to one of the genders that they're sexually attracted to considering the social aspects of being LGBTQ+. Don't get me wrong-- I'm not arguing that you can't use the label you find most comfortable or that you're not bisexual. I just haven't witnessed anyone using the split attraction model who isn't using \"I'm only romantically attracted to one gender when I am sexual attracted to both/all genders\" as a bit of a crutch to avoid the real reasons they're choosing not to consider long-term relationships with some people? Like I've heard bi teenagers use it and then change their label later when they realize that it's not that they weren't romantically attracted to their own gender, it was the hetero-normative societal norms that made them not want to consider a relationship with some of the people they were sexually attracted to? That's just my experience though, and I will point out that's a chronically online experience and the people I'm referring to are ones I knew on the internet. I just find split attraction in general, outside of ace people, to be something that's hard to completely disassociate from the potential outside influence, if that makes sense? \n\nAgain, whatever label you're most comfortable with now is *valid* regardless-- even if you look back in ten years and think that you were wrong about your identity, that doesn't make it any less valid and useful of a term for you to use for yourself *now*. And if this is your true feelings, then I guess this is your true feelings and there's nothing wrong with that either. And you are *absolutely bisexual.* \n\nBut this discussion seems so... juvenile? to me? And I think that's why? Because I haven't met an non-ace adult who uses the split attraction model the way you do? And also because I think your friend's view that she has a right to chose the label for you-- whether she agrees with it or disagrees with it!-- is also very juvenile. Like very 2010 tumblr? She doesn't need to defend the label \"bisexual\" from people who she doesn't think it fits.", "Hello!\n\nOfficial warm, whole hearted welcome to the LGBTQI+ Community!\n\nGender / sexuality / attraction / what we want from relationsips / sex is ALL FLUID and VALID.

And actually its society that cares more than i do at this point.\n\nIm actually at this point of my life dont want a relationship with anyone (does that make me asexual? or just really comfy single?).

And thats all we really understood of it. All I knew was I was not a lesbian, but it took a lot of untangling of others input to figure that out.I also find I am not interested unless I feel connected.\n\nNow I'm probably into dudes like me - closer to non binary than anything.\n\nAm I bi? Well I'm not straight. Am I Pan? Maybe? Am I Non-Binary? sort of?\n\nHave I always thought and felt this way.. no - its all a journey.

NTA OP, don't let assholes like her ruin your day, if you personally identify as Bisexual then that's all that matters, her opinion of your sexuality holds about as much value as the bullshit she's spewing.\n\nETA: This person is not your best friend, she's a straight up mean-girl bully, nothing about her screams genuine friendship material in the slightest, and I hope she becomes little more than an ex-acquaintance in the near future.", "NTA, at all, she sounds horrible just in the way she spoke to you (even if she doesn't agree with you, she shouldn't be talking to you like that). \n\nYou're more sexually attracted to girls and romantically/emotionally attracted to guys... so are many bisexuals (or vice versa).

Its also something that may change over time. \n\n\nI certainly wasn't comfortable dating seriously inside of my own sex/gender until I became more comfortable within my bisexuality. Mainly because the whole of society was telling me that bisexuality wasn't real, that I was just being greedy or was seen as somehow performative for the male gaze of a patriarchal society. \n\n\nOne could be a person who has never dated or had sexual relationships with anyone and that would have zero impact on your sexual identity. \nThe same way that \"experimenting in college\" doesn't necessarily make you queer, having not had a romantic queer relationship doesn't make you straight. \n\nI'd suggest that maybe you should talk to your friend, calmly and try to find out why you declaring and owning your sexual desires makes her so uncomfortable. Maybe it has more to do with her own unrealised desires. Female sexuality and sensuality in all its wonderous forms, often comes with lots of shame. Maybe that's her issue.", "NTA.

My thoughts around LGBTQ are that it\u2019s about accepting all genders and sexualities and also what people want to call themselves. Yes in some ways more specific language and naming can be a good thing but it can also be very bad, divisive and confusing. Why can\u2019t someone call themselves bisexual if they are sexually attracted to both men and women but only date one? Most people would say that was bisexual. I\u2019ve never heard of everyone knowing it involves wanting to actually \u2018date\u2019 as well. I don\u2019t believe in changing how to personally identify to do a \u2018solid\u2019 for a movement. Everyone should be free to identify how they want to. I\u2019m sure you view this differently.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised", ">OR she is attracted to women, but straight privilege is too good to pass on (better pay, a foot in the patriarchy, natural children in wedlock, no homophobia, etc.), so she'll be using women for sex until she gets a husband. I have also met bis and although I do not doubt some are decent people, I have yet to find one that didn't end up in a straight marriage.\n\nThat's a bit ungenerous. While I wouldn't be surprised that OP is saying she's not romantically attracted to women but what's really happening is she's not considering a relationship with a woman due to outside factors, saying \"bis end up in straight marriage to not give up straight privilege\" is kinda shitty. The dating pool for bi people is larger in the \"straight relationship\" side of the spectrum than the \"gay relationship\" side because there are more straights than gay and openly bi people, so without any other considerations of course bi people might end up in straight passing relationships more often.\n\nAnd let's be fair, there's nothing malicious about a bi person who looks at their options to pass as straight and not face homophobia in casual day-to-day life and consciously or unconsciously choosing to pursue relationships that will make their lives easier rather than harder. It sounds pretty sucky in theory, but nobody owes the world to martyr themselves by choosing to make their lives harder deliberately.", "I'm in the same boat. Being bi it seems like you can never be queer enough or straight enough to make people happy. I married a man. I didn't stop being attracted to women. I didn't choose a gender, I chose I person. I'm still attracted to men and women; I stopped acting on those attractions that weren't to my husband because I'm in a monogamous relationship.", "You're only bi when you're single!    /s", "That... Its like if you are bi, someone is always questioning if you really are. Even if you had a  past with both genders... Its sometimes frustrating^^'", "My brother is bi, in a long-term relationship with a man and the number of people who say 'oh so you're gay now' is crazy.", "Yep. 100% sounds like reactive abuse. Friend started in abusing OP until she finally snapped and friend could play the victim.", "Yeah, that sounds like you have a huge bias you need to work on. My post never mentioned cis for one and everyone else for the other. I didn't even mention a binary genders there either. For all we know the OP could ID as agender, so she might be attracted to other agendered people and nonbinary people. Neither are considered cis...  \n\n\nAlso, definitions change with time and age plays a big role on how you define something because it depends on when you learned about it. Like Queer was used for some time as an umbrella term for other genders outside of the binary, but before that it was reclaimed and used for anyone who wasn't heterosexual...  \n\n\nMaybe I'm missing something and I'm fully on board to learn more and expand my vocab, but... I really don't see an issue...", "Ahem, OP says this has been a continual issue since she came out when she was 16.  If friend is as bad as she sounds, why are they still friends after 11.99 years of this?  Because they're both immature and can't find a way to have an adult conversation, despite, again, going back and forth on this for the last twelve years.

It's so dumb and melodramatic and pointless.", "You are a saint for explaining something so obvious to hateful and ignorant people.\n\nI am also one of *those awful fake bisexuals* who has only been with men so far and might end up marrying one. And why? \n\nBecause I am not an active part of the queer community so I rarely meet any queer women in real life. Because I barely get matches with women on tinder. Because I am extremely shy and women are conditioned to not make the first step so dating with men is much more \"efficient\" and faster, thus leading more often to a relationship. \n\nSo many reasons and none of them is that I'm not willing to commit myself to another woman.
