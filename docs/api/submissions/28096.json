By this I mean I laughed silently to myself and turned away so he couldn't see me laugh \n\nI wasn't laughing because he was sad or because he was tired and overwhelmed, all kids get there, I was laughing because when he cries he literally looks just like Kim Kardashians ugly cry face. It's seriously so funny. That and tantrums like that always are funny. Watching someone of any age lose their shit and act like the world is ending over the tiniest of things will never not be funny to me.\n\nWell anyway his mother tells me not to laugh at him and he sees me laughing and decides to have a screaming fit by yelling at us (girlfriend and two other sisters that are not his mom) to shut up and telling me specifically not to laugh at him. I said I wasn't laughing at you dude but even if I was you don't get tell me not to laugh anyway. I can laugh all I want to when I think something is funny. \n\nThen his mom got all pissed off at us and started coddling him and defending him for yelling at us saying it was our fault for bullying him. He's tired so let him be. My girlfriend calls her out saying she needs to stop letting him be an asshole to us. Doesn't matter if he's tired or cranky it doesn't make it ok. He's been pretty shitty lately and goes off for no reason. We get it, he's 4, kids throw tantrums, but he's been awful to everyone around him lately and his mother never disciplines him. She just says let's talk about our feelings when we calm down. \n\nHis mom also says we're not parents so how would we know. I go with the classic Steve hofstetter line of well I'm not a helicopter pilot either but if I see one upside down in a tree I can tell someone fucked up. You don't have to be a parent to know that you need to show some level of discipline when your kid is literally being a dick for no reason.\n\nThis did not go over well of course.\n\nWell anyway she storms off with her shitty kid and goes to her mom, the boys grandma, and rants to her behind everyones back about how awful we all are. And now the Grandma thinks I'm an asshole, not for calling the sister out for a lack of parenting, not for the way we spoke to the kid, but because I laughed at him. Gradma's hyper focused on how much of a jerk I am for laughing at a child. At this point she doesn't even want me to come over anymore. \n\nBy the way I've laughed quietly to myself just like that at every single one of his meltdowns because it is so funny. He has the ugliest cry I've ever seen. \n\nWell anyway, am I the asshole here? I can provide more details if necessary.", "created_utc": 1696272992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16y4ztt/aitah_for_laughing_when_a_child_threw_a_tantrum/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, you don't get to dictate how other people parent their kids. You act like the mom is bad for wanting to talk to the child once he's calm. That's a commonly-used technique nowadays, popular with \"gentle parenting\" and \"Montessori\" methodologies. You don't get to shame her over that, regardless of if you believe in it.

You should have excused yourself and left the room for a while when his mum said not to laugh. Also no parent likes being pulled up over their parenting choices, even if you believe they are wrong.

The perfect age to tell him it's not ok to be violent and yelling at others just because he's having a bad day.

And OP talks about discipline like he is an expert as he literally makes fun of a 4 year old and thinks it's okay.", "I definitely have that when it comes to this kid and his mom so you're probably right. I'm biased as fuck about them. Especially because she has frequent black out rage fits where she assaults her family members and is now passing it onto her child.", "Yeah she attempts the gentle parenting method instead of being an active parent in his life and he's becoming increasingly violent and awful to everyone when she's around. When she's not around he's actually the sweetest kid in the world. It's obviously not working. But oh well. This post has already been super divisive.", "You're probably correct on that. I'll admit I shouldn't have even got involved but at this point it's just too hard not to. The mother is one of the most awful people I know and literally the whole rest of the family can't stand her but they tolerate her because they want her son in their lives. I really was trying to do the right thing because I feel like she's sending that kid down a bad path towards becoming the violent narcissist she is but you're correct. It's not my business. That being said, my girlfriend and her other sisters who were present were saying the same things I did and yet all the focus is on me because I'm not technically family. Shit sucks. I've had to remain silent while she abuses everyone for so long and the one time I actually speak up I probably just made it all worse. I'm for sure willing to admit that I had some asshole tendencies in this situation but I certainly believe I'm not the only asshole in that fight. I love that stupid little turd even when he's being a dick to everyone and I just want to see better for him.", "I fully agree with you. I don't believe there is any one right way to be a parent. My opinions on this specific situation are mostly based on precedent though. When his mother is not around, he's incredibly well behaved, very sweet, very loving, full of laughter and joy but also consistent discipline. No one yells at him or spanks him or anything, but he is clearly informed of when things are right or wrong and he responds very well to this. He will even come and apologize with a hug if he thinks he's done anything wrong. When his mother is around he becomes a demon. The gentle parenting has in my opinion proven to be very ineffective for him and his violent outbursts occur exclusively when she is nearby. This is likely because she does the same even now at age 29. I've seen her become violent towards everyone in her family over the most trivial of things and has frequent blackout rage moments. She has punched two holes in the wall, been the center of three police calls, and takes every chance she gets to insult you in the most painful ways possible. During this argument, she said to me what do you know about parenting, you fatherless prick? My father died last year. She's an awful person. And when we see this gentle parenting style coming from her and how much she's turning her kid into herself, we can't help but want to interfere. The only problem is most people in her family don't say anything because they are scared of her. She will attack at the drop of a hat. Should I have said what I said? Probably not. It's not my place. But someone needs to say it. I know I should have handled things better and I really don't know the correct way to do it but I feel confident when something like this is clearly wrong.", "How am I bragging?", "True dat. I should have kept quiet. Especially since I'm technically not family. But someone has to say something and I'm glad my girlfriend and her other sisters did also and backed me up.", "I wasn't laughing at his distress. I actually felt bad for the poor guy because he doesn't know how to deal with overwhelming emotions. It happens. He's 4. I laughed because he literally looks like this\n https://images.app.goo.gl/y8PjT99Pd4aGsE7b8\nHe's a cute kid but he has the ugliest cry and yeah that shit is funny as hell to me.", "Dude even adults are still learning how to regulate emotions. That's the problem here though. Being pissed off doesn't make it ok to attack others. He's at an age where he needs to start learning that instead of being shown by an emotionally unstable parent that he's always the victim and everyone else is the problem, negative actions will have negative consequences. I'm not saying I'm not an asshole for laughing but that doesn't justify him getting violent like his mother.", "Dude, four year olds aren't particularly good at self-regulating. You sound incredibly callous about kids.", "He wasn't yelling at you bc he had a bad day, he was yelling at you bc you were actively laughing at him while he was having trouble regulating his emotions you weirdo. Seems like he knows about right and wrong; he knew you were laughing at him and that was wrong, so he stood up for himself. \n\nYTA and grow the hell up.", "Relevant, did I miss that in the post?", "You're probably the last person to judge what awful behavior is when you're actively laughing at a 4 year old and then trying to argue with him about it \n\nWorry about yourself", "\"I've laughed at every single one of his meltdowns\" is bragging, asshole. And don't bother coming back with \"no brag, just fact.\"", "It's obvious who is a parent and not by the comments. \n\nMy 3 YO can be really shitty and a dick. I love her to death but it's objectively true. When my child is objectively being shitty and a dick, the plan is to *correct it*. \n\nI also laugh at my child's tantrums sometimes too, just like *every single parent* commenting here. \n\nIt's really rude tho to laugh at the kid *AFTER* he gets upset noticing you. You doubled down. You could have explained that you're not laughing at him, the person, but laughing at the situation. Something the kid might understand. \n\nBUT... Even being a parent it's hard to turn around every situation into a learning experience, so I understand why it would happen. Realistically though, you have hurt the child, not the parent. The child is failing because of the parent, so hurting the child is cruel. \n\nJust let the kid know. Probably one of those like ESH situations but it's not really a big deal.", "Again exactly. Which is why this isn't about the child's self regulation. We are very understanding of a child having a bad day and losing his shit. It happens. It's about a mother doing no regulation. His mom is the real problem here. I will never be mad at a kid for being shitty. It's not their fault. But I will always be mad at a parent who encourages their kid to be shitty by enabling that kind of behavior", "Again I literally wasn't at him on any visible spectrum and he didn't even know I was laughing until his mom made it look like I was.", "Nah I didn't throw it in there. Probably should have. I didn't want my bias to come through too hard at first. Wanted outsider opinions.", "You're totally right. Encouraging a kid to act with blind rage is totally acceptable. \n\nOf course I'm analyzing myself here. Why do you think I made this post? I'm not saying I'm not an asshole for laughing. I probably am. But that doesn't make me incapable of identifying shitty behavior. If anything it makes me better at recognizing it.", "It's literally not? Bragging means to be proud or boastful. That sentence is literally doing neither. I'm not showing pride for laughing and I'm not trying to say how cool I am for laughing. Any bragging you think is going on there is something you read into it.", "That was the thing and it says it in the post. I told him I wasn't laughing at him. My response after that was definitely not perfect and I'm probably going to apologize to him for it but lately he's developed a really annoying habit of thinking he can boss everyone around. Probably because he successfully does boss around his mother. I didn't mean for it to be \"I can laugh at you if I want to.\" It was supposed to be more of \"dude you don't get to boss me around.\" But it came out wrong for sure and I do want to clarify that.", "How did she \"enable\" him? Because she didn't yell at him?", "That's the only \"bad\" thing that needs clarifying really. The kid should know.\n\nThe mom already knows now, lol. She's messing up."]}
