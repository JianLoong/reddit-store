But be prepared for the hassle from mom, bro and their flying monkeys. You could show them this post and the comments as rebuttal. Bottom line is, people can make wills to benefit those who loved them and maintained a relationship, and cut off those who didn't. That's what your dad did. Your brother isn't entitled to a  goddamn thing.", "NTA\n\nHowever, it\u2019s about money, not your Dad. If your brother needed money would you give it to him? If the answer is no.... then don\u2019t. If you would then just pick an amount, write the check & be done with it.\n\neta \u2014 your Dad\u2019s money was not earned by either one of you. Neither of you worked for that money. You both made choices but your Dad was the only one who earned that money & he decided to leave it to you for his reasons.

He is suffering the consequences of his (in)action.", "NTA, your dad left everything to YOU, you\u2019d be going against his wishes to split it with him. If you feel any kind of guilt donate to a deserving organization.", "NTA\n\nPeople can feel however which way they want to about this.

It didn't happen. \n\n\"Respectfully, I am choosing to honor dad's wishes. I understand you find that upsetting, but I will not be disrespectful of our father's decision.\"", "NTA. Your dad had one child who made time for him and was a significant part of his life, and one child who is more interested in dad\u2019s stuff and money than dad. If I were your father, I probably would have done the same as him.", "NTA. Your dad made his wishes clear. Honor what he wanted.", "NTA - He didn\u2019t have a relationship with your dad. Too late now.", "NTA\n\nI think he got what he earned. \n\nThink long and hard about this though, if you give him nothing, you'll probably never have a relationship with him. If he's the type to examine every penny to make sure he's getting at least half that might not even matter - I can see him taking half then never seeing you again.", "Your dad left everything to you. Stick with his wishes. Fuck your asshole brother", "Nta", "NTA my dad changed as will at the end of his life to leave everything to me but that was only because my brother died before my dad died.  He initially was leaving everything to my brother because my brother was a narcissist who lied and slandered me his whole life, so when he became close to my dad when I wasn\u2019t that in itself would be enough reason for my dad to leave everything to him but I\u2019m also sure that was lying and slandering going on. And even saying that, I wouldn\u2019t have expected my brother to give me any of my dad\u2018s money if my dad had died before my brother. He wrote his will the way he wrote it because that\u2019s how he wanted it.", "NTA\n\nYour Dad's will is his last wish regarding his worldly possessions. If he wanted your brother to get anything, he'd have set it up that way. He didn't. Respect your father's wishes.", "NTA, he left it to you for a reason. I do like other people\u2019s comments that you could help him out in some way such as paying off credit card debts or maybe some of a car loan so he doesn\u2019t get nothing. Sounds like a selfish brother though", "NTA \n\nPeople who take the time to make a will know exactly what they want, what they are doing, and why.", "NTA. A will is very personal, id respect his wishes.", "Eh, you\u2019re not an AH but you might have more peace if you did at least something for your brother. I had a similar experience and helped pay off a family member\u2019s credit card. She was grateful, it wasn\u2019t a huge loss for me and our relationship improved because of it.", "NTA. But if you do get legal advice. Legally he left the money to you. You will pay estate/inheritance tax for the inheritance.  You giving him money is not the terms of the will, it is still legally your money you would be giving him and depending on how much there are likely further taxes to pay. If you are giving him anything that the will doesn't stipulate, you need to be covered that it is abve board because as far as the tax man is concerned the money is the person named in the will and no one else's. Therefore more tax might be owed if you start handing it out.", "NTA. And be careful. \n\nIf you forfeit parts of your dads estate to your brother it can later be taken to court as a \u201csee, even she knows dad wanted me to have \u2026\u201d. In essence if you give him anything you would be piercing the veil. I\u2019d give him nothing until after everything is settled and legally transferred to your name. Even then you don\u2019t need to.", "I feel like this really depends on *why* the brother didn\u2019t try to have more of a relationship with his dad. Like\u2026 I feel like that makes all the difference really. If the dad fucked up in the past, then it was on him to rebuild that relationship with his child. Besides, what\u2019s the brothers home like? What\u2019s his work life like? Did he actively HAVE the time to set aside for his father? Or was he busy trying to make ends meet?", "NTA but it also depend on how much money was left and how much you both have imo.  If you are already doing Ok financially and your brother isn't I would give him something.  It's only money at the end of the day.", "My little sister has been sucking up to my parent since forever and I fully expect every cent to go to the golden favourite child.  I suspect there might be *reasons* why your brother went LC.  YTA.", "Where I live that's illegal.  All children must share equally by law. That prevents parents from giving eldest everything or nothing to daughters  or hating your gay child.  If he had gifted you before his death that's another matter. Your experience of your father's treatment and his are probably completely different.  I'm going to assume your brother went nc because his dad was a dick to him.

Your father is the one who created the will and it is ultimately his decision as to who he chooses to leave his possessions to. It is understandable that your brother would feel hurt and confused, but it is your father's prerogative to make this decision and it should be respected. Ultimately, you had no say in your father's decision and must abide by his wishes.", "If someone takes the time to write you out of their will..you know you fkd up. Instead of demanding your un-earned portion, I would work harder to mend the broken bridges I left in my wake. \n\nWhen a person dies you take nothing with you....except your honour. \n\nI think dad made it clear that he didn't think your brother had any. Sorry. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your dad wanted you to have it.", "NTA. From the sounds of it, giving money to your brother would do nothing to improve whatever relationship you previously had... if you even have any more of a relationship than him and your dad.\n\nAll it would really do is avoid potentially degrading the relationship with others in your extended family.\n\nBut a small consession or two may be adequate.\n\nHere's a suggestion...\n\nYour dad left you a house full of stuff. Even if you want to keep the house, you probably don't want most of that stuff. Which probably means estate sale.\n\nAfter you've decided what you do want to keep (and have taken home), before any estate sale, let him pick out some stuff he'd want to keep.\n\nThat way he can't say he got nothing or that you got rid of something he wanted.\n\nIf you were being generous, you might also want to share a portion of the procedes from the estate sale with him.\n\nIt might not completely silence him or others in the family. But it may get some of them off your back, and will keep them from claiming you gave him nothing.", "NTA.\n\n\nBut as a word of caution - if the inheritance is anything considerable, the possibility of your brother challenging the will could happen. It could get ugly. Be prepared and have an estate lawyer check for any loopholes now.", "YTA family is super important, so even if your father didn\u2019t leave anything for your brother, you should at least share and try to make amends with him.", "Agree completely with this answer.  Thank you for sharing.  When it comes to money, every human is an asshole, from billionaires to homeless junkies, we're all greedy, selfish money worshippers.", "Or at least see an estate planning attorney. My friend just died and her son\u2019s property was in her name because he couldn\u2019t get any kind of assistance owning a property. She never saw an estate planning attorney so now that she\u2019s dead that property is going to have to go into probate and be sold and I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to live. I don\u2019t think it matters that he inherited that property from someone I think it matters that he deeded it to her so now it belongs to her estate.", "Most wills I have seen have a clause that indicates if anyone contests the will they cannot have anything. They also will list the kids and specifically exclude them so nobody can come along and pretend that the parent forgot about them or didn\u2019t know about them and that\u2019s why they weren\u2019t listed", "If I died before my sibling and he gave my mom some of my money when I specifically told him not to I would come back and haunt everyone.\n\nIf someone takes the time to write out a will you need to respect that", "This is the best answer. It\u2019s a long story as to why I feel like I should give my brother half of my inheritance, even though the law says that he\u2019s not entitled to any of it I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. I need the money a lot more than he does, but I\u2019m going to split it with him because I said I would because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but also I don\u2019t think he understands that legally he doesn\u2019t have a claim to any of it and I don\u2019t want to be accused of scamming it or stealing it from him", " NTA\nPeople can feel however which way they want to about this. Guess what, their opinions don't matter.", "OP implied she only sees the brother at family functions. It sounds like brother doesn't bother to make time for family. That's his choice but without some sort of relationship people don't just hand out money. People get busy and daily calls and weekly visits might be too much for them but no contact at all unless you're in the same place at the same time isn't a relationship.", "Oh stop, even the busiest person can make a phone call or send a text message or a birthday card or something.\n\nAnd none of this matters, what matters is the father decided to leave everything to her. It would be disrespectful to not honor his wishes", "OP doesn't live where you live, so it doesn't matter. And for that matter, why are you just...*assuming* that dad was a dick to brother? Nothing in the post suggests that, and while it's not impossible, sometimes it's just not that deep.", "Not leaving someone an inheritance isn\u2019t abuse. That\u2019s absurd. If he died penniless would that also be abusive?", "Yeah, I never understand how these things get so \"automatically contested\" just because someone is excluded.  Unless it's written on college rules paper, you likely had it drawn up by an attorney, right?\n\nHow does that even get argued in court?  I feel like a will, which presumably directs who ones possessions go to, is pretty clear by it's very nature.  How do you go to court and argue that you should get a share of someone's possessions on the basis that they didn't want you to have anything?  Especially if you can't prove at least regular contact?\n\nI could see if you had known about one copy of a will, only to have your sibling produce a different one upon a parents death.  But the idea of \"two kids so naturally I'm going to get 50%, right\"? doesn't seem like it would hold up legally.", "OP!\u261d\ufe0f\n\nA will states what the person wanted after passing. It cannot be clearer than written in a will. That's it.", "I\u2019m not sorry to say that the truth isn\u2019t always respectful. This isn\u2019t *about* what\u2019s respectful, it\u2019s about what\u2019s right. If the son was treated like shit by the father and the father never made it right, why would he reach out? We don\u2019t know the truth of their relationship. OP probably doesn\u2019t even know the full truth of their relationship as it wasn\u2019t their relationship. They only know what they\u2019ve seen for themselves, and what they\u2019ve been told. And that doesn\u2019t equal a full story. Not without the brothers side of why.", "I think it is. Goldenchild dynamic is abuse I see it all the time. Building generational wealth within the family should be equitable.  If they have kids one set shouldn't be economically advantaged. It creates rifts within families.", "Ok, maybe brother wasn't treated well by the father. Still wouldn't entitle them to even a scrap of the will tho", "That is ENTIRELY debatable. Especially from a cultural standpoint.", "You make a good point. If I were in this situation, I personally would not split the inheritance as it would go against my father's wishes, but this is a very touchy subject and I can understand people who might do things differently, if this were them."]}
