But if you do get legal advice. Legally he left the money to you. You will pay estate/inheritance tax for the inheritance.  You giving him money is not the terms of the will, it is still legally your money you would be giving him and depending on how much there are likely further taxes to pay. If you are giving him anything that the will doesn't stipulate, you need to be covered that it is abve board because as far as the tax man is concerned the money is the person named in the will and no one else's.

Even if you want to keep the house, you probably don't want most of that stuff.

Why are your mom and her family even expressing opinions about this issue - it has absolutely nothing to do with them as they were not a part of your father's life at the time of his death. You mention that your brother is angry and upset - is he angry and upset at himself because he has run out of time to act like a loving son or is he angry and upset that he didn't get the money he wanted in the will? Of course, now that the estate has been bequeathed to you, it is yours to do with as you want and see fit but, please, think long and hard about what to do - you've already mentioned in your post that you do not want to and I would suggest that the main reason you do not want to is because you did have a real and loving relationship with your father and are not comfortable dishonoring his final requests that he made known in his will.

This entity is overseen by a trustee, who carries out the grantor's wishes and ensures the assets are distributed to the designated beneficiaries.\n\nSo, why is a trust important when it comes to after-life matters? Well, it offers several key advantages. First and foremost, a trust allows you to have control over the distribution of your assets even after your passing. By establishing clear instructions within the trust document, you can specify who receives what and when. This ensures your wishes are respected and can help prevent potential disputes among family members or other interested parties.\n\nAdditionally, trusts can offer privacy and expedite the probate process. Unlike a will, which typically goes through the probate court and becomes a matter of public record, a trust generally avoids probate altogether. This means your assets can be distributed more swiftly and discreetly, reducing the likelihood of public scrutiny or unwanted interference.\n\nFurthermore, a trust provides an effective tool for managing assets on behalf of minor children or individuals who may not have the capacity to handle their finances. You can appoint a trustee to oversee the assets and make decisions in the beneficiaries' best interests, ensuring their financial security and well-being.\n\nLastly, trusts can also help minimize estate taxes and protect your assets from certain creditors. Depending on your jurisdiction and the type of trust you establish, you may be able to take advantage of tax planning strategies that could potentially reduce the tax burden on your estate. Moreover, certain trusts, such as irrevocable trusts, can provide a level of asset protection, shielding them from creditors or legal claims.\n\nRemember, everyone's circumstances are unique, and the laws governing trusts can vary from place to place. It's always wise to consult with a qualified estate planning attorney to understand how a trust can specifically benefit your after-life wishes and ensure your legacy is carried out as you envision.", "You\u2019re right, albeit pedantic. I did not say that. I advised people to set up a trust so that they can have clear discussions and expectations about assets after life. It does not prevent litigation, you\u2019re right, but it certainly makes \u201clife\u201d if you will, a lot easier.", "In some countries that doesn\u2019t work. Where I live the spouse and the kids would both get 50% automatically, this can be reduced to 25%.

Of course you can give some of YOUR money to whoever you want, but to allow it to be seen as an inheritance from someone who didn\u2019t want to leave them an inheritance is disrespectful.", "It\u2019s a difficult choice - particularly when your father definitely wanted to take care of the person who took care of him while he was alive. And felt your brother didn\u2019t deserve his money. \n\nGiving half to your brother feels disrespectful towards your father\u2019s wishes who was likely quite resentful your brother didn\u2019t give a damn about him.\n\nAlso, your brother won\u2019t appreciate anything less that 1/2 and still be angry with you & dad.

Now they want everybody to know that it is impossible for them to put things right while all that hinders them is their own greed.\n\nThis whole setup is strange, though. Why was/is the relationship between brother and father so bad?  And between brother and her? Was it a bad divorce story and they took different sides? Was she the Golden Child? Did he not live up to his fathers expectations? Was the dad one of those parents who are not able to be interested in a kids life if it does not mach their life? Is the brother gay or something? And where is the mother in all of this? \n\nI am sure that there is more to it than OP wants to tell us.

Drama avoided.", "If a child is literally not mentioned at all in a parents will it can be easy to contest (depending on how the will is written) because what is important during probate is \"probable intent.\"\n\nFor example, consider a will that said something like \"I leave 100% of my physical property to my progeny, Any_Bread.\" In response to that, the other son can say, \"clearly this was a small mistake where it meant to list both of us after progeny such that it meant to say 'my progeny, Any_Bread and Bad_Son.' In fact he had a conversation with me to that effect and told me he was going to write a new will. I think he probably lost the new will that split property 50/50, or maybe Any_Bread purposefully threw it away.\"\n\nThis is the kind of vengeful things that get said in a probate hearing. As such, what you should do is specifically list assets that will go to specific people and say that it goes to them and them alone, and make sure you list specific people that you are excluding (\"I leave 100% of the house at 1234 Cedar, my corvette, and the boathouse at 567 river road to my child Any_Bread, and Any_Bread alone. Bad_Son gets nothing.\"), though better off is to include some nominal amount so that they don't have reason to contest (e.g., you say they get 5k if they accept, and 0 if they contest, cuz otherwise they have nothing to lose by fighting).\n\nBut yes, probate can be a he-said-she-said affair, so you REALLY want to make sure that you have your ducks in a row if you want to have an uneven distribution among your kids.", "This is a myth.

Nobody owes you anything and your brother has just found that out the hard way.", "This shit would never happen in British Columbia.", "If there wasn\u2019t a will, probate would have split it equally.  \n\nYou can\u2019t expect it to not be remembered, or an issue, at every single family gathering from now to eternity. \n\nYou don\u2019t seem to know exactly how dad and brother came to loggerheads. Rotten shit happens between parents and children that neither disclose. \n\nInheritance is a windfall to those who receive them. Most people have nothing to leave their kids.  \n\nAttempt to imagine being in your brother\u2019s shoes.  \n\nSplit the damn inheritance equally and set the stage to improve your relationship with your brother.", "NTA.

It\u2019s only money. \n\nBe generous, OP, and don\u2019t think of it again. \n\nThis has nothing to do with your brother or your dad or how you feel about their relationship. This has everything to do with you.", "please seek legal advice at r/legaladvice", "Honour your fathers wishes. NTA.", "YTA In the vast majority of cases kids who refuse contact with their parents were abused in one way or another. Looking at your ages i'm guessing your father was in the boomer generation where a beating or two was the right course of action if they felt you didn't respect their Ego erm i mean \"authority\". Even with the prevalent sexism in that generation toward daughters it is a fact that boys were punished far harder the vast majority of the time. So how many beatings and how much mental abuse did your father inflict on your brother to \"make a man\" out of him. Or let me guess is your brother Gay or Bisexual.  Give your brother his blood money i guarantee with the abuse he endured he has damn well earned it.", "NTA\n\nYour dad's wishes were for you to get everything. He had his reasons.", "NTA.  Don't give him a penny.  This is your inheritance.  He got his.  Every penny he deserved.", "i would give him some things of your fathers because it\u2019s all he will have left. after all, these are materialistic things but they cannot be replaced. it is nobody\u2019s place to judge your father and his sons relationship.. your brother unfortunately will have to live with it.", "NTA it was your dad's  money and he did what he wanted with it. You are honoring your dad's wishes and honestly you kinda would be an A if you went against what your dad wanted", "NTA\n\nYour brother didn't bother with your father but now wants half his stuff. He's a greedy bastard. Be sure to talk to a lawyer because I bet your brother will do the same if he hasn't already and only pretended to give you time to think about it. Was your brother officially disowned?", "NTA.", "Honestly, if you want to continue your relationship with your brother then it\u2019s best to split it. It\u2019s no longer about your dad but about you guys. If you don\u2019t split it, kiss that relationship goodbye (I\u2019m speaking from experience).", "NTA, however I understand that it's a complex situation in some ways. My grandmother passed and left nothing to her son, and instead passed it to the grandkids. We gave a portion to our uncle because it meant a lot to him and he helped us out a lot when we were younger, and our grandmother had mental illness issues that I think clouded her better judgment. In this case I don't really see any of that. I think maybe you can discuss why things happened the way that they did, and if he needs some money you can be there for him if you desire to, but you're nta and have no obligation toward him. I agree with the other posts and seek legal counsel soon to ensure the will either can't be contested or you're protected against it being contested in some way.", "YNTA.\nYour brother is.\nHe want 50% for doing absolutely nothing for your father.\nYour brother doesn\u2019t deserve anything from the inheritance.\nHe hasn\u2019t earned it like you did.", "Ive always been impressed by peoples behavior when a family member with a large estate passes away. It truly brings out the worst in people. And usually its usually the ones who you least expect. I would follow the will to the letter. Your dad had his reasons.  If your sibling cant figure it out, too bad.", "I think you should either split some with him or do something legally. Inheritance court causes even more chaos than divorce court does. It will definitely cause a rift if you don't do anything.", "OP should also consult a lawyer about creating her own will to make sure that if anything should happen to her, the money she inherited along with the rest of her estate goes to the people and organization she wants, rather than her mother, brother, and every other relative fighting over it in court.", "Yeah I don\u2019t know about other states but where I am a person has every right to leave his estate to whomever he wants, and people who try to contest a valid will are SOL except for in very unusual circumstances. OP should consult with a lawyer, but there\u2019s nothing in this post to suggest this will is invalid. \n\nHis dad wanted OP to have it all. OP doesn\u2019t owe anybody anything he doesn\u2019t want to give.", "As someone who works with trusts among other things like Estates and Coporations, absolutely put them in a trust. But whatever you do, please make sure you do not do the taxes yourself. I can\u2019t tell you the amount of times I\u2019ve seen people in deep debt because they tried to do taxes themselves instead of hiring an account. Hire a lawyer put the inheritance in a trust and just bite the bullet and hired a company to set up and maintain the taxes.", "Happens ALL the time. Half of our family is still estranged due to a will contest - which happened 30 years ago and wasn\u2019t remotely a ton of money. People get fucking weird with post death assets and it\u2019s why I\u2019ve told my parents to give their shit away, I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with that.", "homeless junkies?!?!.......  you're the AH for this comment", "My Mom died with no will. My brother and I had issues growing up, 10 years difference between the two of us didn't help. My parents thought we would fight like cats and dogs over everything. \n\nWe actually have gotten along better. We haven't argued over the stuff. Okay, we play fight over a set of antique chairs... However, we both realized that our family was down to the two of us. Pretty much everything would go to my nephew that I raised since birth. I was 51 when Mom died, him 41. Our family died early, so it just wasn't worth fighting. \n\nSome families would prefer to have their Mom back instead of dealing with everything.", "Me too, my friend, me too.  Thanks for your comment.", "I love you too emoney7610", "Why would one of your siblings think they are entitled to everything?   Just curious how a person comes to that conclusion when they have siblings.    Does your dad know that your sibling feels that way?    You said you guys know it but does dad?   If that\u2019s not what dad intends to happen he needs to get his will taken care of ASAP!   \n\nI\u2019m 61 as well and believe me I don\u2019t want to go anytime soon but it\u2019s going to happen someday!", "Ex-FIL is veteran with a VA proscription bottle of pain killers as big as a milk jug.

Theres not going to be an estate planning shortcut that gets someone a free house if it has a mortgage on it", "Oh boy, this is going to be a long one. There are four of us in total. The sibling in question is my older (half) brother, he\u2019s 13 years my senior and there are 10 years between him and my older brother. He was the only child for a long time and his mom had practically nothing to do with him from age 3 onward. When he was 8, my dad met my mom and they had a toxic relationship (she got him hooked on drugs by her own admission and there was a lot of physical violence). \n\nThey separated shortly after I was born, around the time my dad suffered a workplace injury. About 3 years later they both  hit rock bottom. My grandma\u2019s house where we all lived burned down, my maternal grandmother stepped up  and cared for my older brother, sister and I but couldn\u2019t financially support my oldest brother. He was 16 at the time, and the only place he could go was my aunt\u2019s house 400 miles away but he was eventually kicked out for smoking pot (the only rule was not to smoke pot at the house, but he wouldn\u2019t stop). My aunt set him up with an apartment that she paid for, took him to get his GED and got him a job. \n\nA couple years later, my dad got clean (super proud of him, he\u2019s been off drugs for 20 years now) and my oldest brother moved in with us. My mom had kicked her drug habit but was struggling with alcoholism at this point so my dad got full custody when I was 6. Since then my brother has been living with my dad. He even moved his girlfriend and her kids into the house my dad bought 4 years ago, proceeded to have another kid, and take up the majority of my dad\u2019s house. This was 20 years ago, and my brother still hangs my dad\u2019s addiction and his crappy teenage years over his head. My brother pays very little rent ($600 for 3 rooms of my dads house and my dad covers his insurance and phone bill; we live in California so it\u2019s HCOL) and likes to remind us how he had a perfect life until we were born. To an extent, I feel bad but he\u2019s just shy of 40 now. It\u2019s time to grow up.\n\nBut yeah, because he had a bad childhood and we didn\u2019t and he still lives with dad, apparently he thinks he gets everything. My dad was smart enough to set up a will with my sister being the executor. We all know this but my oldest brother. None of us are going to tell him because we don\u2019t want him disrupting dads life any more than he already is.", "I\u2019m sorry about all of the struggles your family has had to go through.  Even though your brother perceives his life was harder than anyone else\u2019s from the sounds of it you and your other siblings had some rough patches as well.   With your brother he brought on a fair bit himself.\n\nIt\u2019s good to. Now your dad sees this and has put things in place when the time comes.   Yes it\u2019s better to keep it all quiet.", "Um, maybe check with your attorney, but I suspect if you cut them our completely, they woukd be somewhat successful in court.\n\nLeaving them at least something should delete their ability to win."]}
