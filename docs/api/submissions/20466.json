But if you do get legal advice. Legally he left the money to you. You will pay estate/inheritance tax for the inheritance.  You giving him money is not the terms of the will, it is still legally your money you would be giving him and depending on how much there are likely further taxes to pay. If you are giving him anything that the will doesn't stipulate, you need to be covered that it is abve board because as far as the tax man is concerned the money is the person named in the will and no one else's.

Were they close before or have they always been like that.", "Not when your family sucks. Just because someone if family doesn't mean they're good people and deserve anything. Clearly you don't have a problematic family otherwise you wouldn't be saying this.", "If family is so important, why does brother get a pass for being a crappy son? And why should OP 'make amends'? She didn't do anything wrong.", "Many rejected LGTBTQ2S+ children are written out of wills just for their gender or who they love. \n\nOthers are written out for calling out and breaking cycles of abuse.\n\nIn both of those circumstances, it is the will writer who \"fkd up\".\n\nOtherwise, yes, I agree wills should be respected as written.", ">Most wills I have seen have a clause that indicates if anyone contests the will they cannot have anything.\n\nBut if the son was left nothing to start with, he doesn't really have anything to lose by contesting the will. Maybe it will be thrown out on some technicality, maybe it won't. But if he doesn't contest it, he'll get nothing anyway.\n\nThis is a good reason to leave some token amount -- maybe even something like $10K. it makes it clear that this was intentional and not an oversight, and it means there is something to lose if they contest it.", "Your brother is understandably (but not acceptably) upset, but your father had good reasons for his decision and your brother had time to correct his behavior. He is suffering the consequences of his (in)action.", "Project much?", ">we're all greedy, selfish money worshippers.\n\n\nI personally take exception to that...(you were talking about me, weren't you)\n\nMy mother died 2 months ago.  Two weeks later, so did my ex-MIL.\n\nAll of the kids and grandkids have come together to make sure my dad is ok. Not one word was mentioned about money except to make sure dad had a will.\n\nMy ex's family was fighting in the same room as her dead mother before they even called 911.  \n\nMy daughters have now broken all ties with them except for their mom n grandpa.  It's all about respect and how you were raised.", "Just because property gets probated doesn't mean it automatically gets sold.\n\nDad died intestate, the wasn't any money, but there was a house and we, the children, have not sold it. Laws obviously differ, but my understanding is that a sale of property has to be forced by an heir.", "Are you the OP? Username is different. \n\nAlso, don't give him dick.", "What does this have to do with what Beebum5 said?", "You\u2019d be shocked, shocked, at how many after life planning things are esstenially written on college rules paper\u2014legally speaking. There\u2019s a whole industry around it. Family court, divorces, custody, wills, estates, etc where there is a \u201cwill\u201d there\u2019s a way.", "Well, it depends on where you're from. In my country all children are legally \"owed\" a certain percentage from the inheritance. Minor children are entitled to bigger percentage, but adult children can't be taken out of will either. I think it's 3/4 for a minors and 1/4 for adults. If they're not included in the will they have a right to contest it.\n\nYou can disown your child, but it's complicated procedure and there are specific reasons for disowning such us going no contact with the parent, abuse the parent, lead criminal life etc. It can be pretty hard to prove it.", "I\u2019ve worked in Will and estate law and this is definitely what lawyers suggest you do, especially for children. Leaving them a small amount makes it much harder to contest because it was clearly intentional.\n\nAnd if you really want to leave absolutely nothing for whatever reason, it\u2019s best to put a clause in the Will to that affect, to make it clear they were left out on purpose and they can\u2019t argue that they were forgotten or were told verbally or anything else they might try. One lawyer I worked for would keep notes outlining why someone was disinherited so if challenged years later, she\u2019d be able to share the thoughts of the deceased.", "We don\u2019t know why the brother and dad weren\u2019t close, to be fair. Does the dad only like traditionally presenting gender roles and the son felt smothered by masculine standards? Was the dad progressive and the son a trump supporter? Etc.", "Sounds like a good reason to spend my money directly on the children I want, I guess.\n\nI would be frustrated if I knew that an estranged family member that I hated would get a large portion of my life's savings because they had a bunch of kids who also hate me.", "Yep, I live in such a country. If my husband and I buy a house, and he dies first, his half of the house doesn't go to me - it goes to his son. \n\nWe can do some fancy paperwork and make it so his half get split between us, so I'd own 75%, and we can make it so the child can't stop a sale, but best case scenario I have to buy him out for 25% if I sell.\n\nThe surviving spouse always has usufruit - meaning, they get use of the house until they die. But there are definitely instances of people essentially held hostage without being able to move to where they have family or liquidate their assets, either because they can't afford the buyout or because some adult kids have put a stop on the sale because they've decided 50% of the money isn't enough, they want to inherit *that* house.\n\nWhen my father died and my mother liquidated so she could move across the country to where she had a job, many of my French friends were appalled on my behalf - 'she sold your house?!'", "Or the son just didn\u2019t have an interest in having a relationship with his father? Everything doesn\u2019t need to have a grand explanation behind it, sometimes it just is what it is. \n\nNTA OP.", "It's even more difficult. For example, if I wanted to give my property to my child while still being alive, it can be later contested by the other child that didn't receive such a big gift. They can sue for bigger portion of inheritance because the other sibling benefitted more when the parent was alive or even sue for the gift and court might actually force a sale of the property and split it between siblings or other similar scenarios. \n\nMy grandpa gave me something valuable before his death and it was difficult to come with a legal way that I can keep it. My uncle thought he's going to get it, but fortunately he legally gave up his right to contest the will before he found that I got it."]}
