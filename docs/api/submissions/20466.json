But if you do get legal advice. Legally he left the money to you. You will pay estate/inheritance tax for the inheritance.  You giving him money is not the terms of the will, it is still legally your money you would be giving him and depending on how much there are likely further taxes to pay. If you are giving him anything that the will doesn't stipulate, you need to be covered that it is abve board because as far as the tax man is concerned the money is the person named in the will and no one else's.

Even if you want to keep the house, you probably don't want most of that stuff.

I used an estate attorney, by the way, to make sure everything was above board.", "Her son should talk to an attorney and be claiming that mom was holding the property in trust for him so it should not form part of her estate (unless he is the sole beneficiary, it which case probate savings likely won\u2019t be worth the lawyer\u2019s fees).", "In simple terms, a trust is a legal arrangement where a person (known as the \"grantor\" or \"settlor\") transfers their assets to a separate entity (the \"trust\") to be managed and distributed according to their instructions. This entity is overseen by a trustee, who carries out the grantor's wishes and ensures the assets are distributed to the designated beneficiaries.\n\nSo, why is a trust important when it comes to after-life matters? Well, it offers several key advantages. First and foremost, a trust allows you to have control over the distribution of your assets even after your passing. By establishing clear instructions within the trust document, you can specify who receives what and when. This ensures your wishes are respected and can help prevent potential disputes among family members or other interested parties.\n\nAdditionally, trusts can offer privacy and expedite the probate process. Unlike a will, which typically goes through the probate court and becomes a matter of public record, a trust generally avoids probate altogether. This means your assets can be distributed more swiftly and discreetly, reducing the likelihood of public scrutiny or unwanted interference.\n\nFurthermore, a trust provides an effective tool for managing assets on behalf of minor children or individuals who may not have the capacity to handle their finances. You can appoint a trustee to oversee the assets and make decisions in the beneficiaries' best interests, ensuring their financial security and well-being.\n\nLastly, trusts can also help minimize estate taxes and protect your assets from certain creditors. Depending on your jurisdiction and the type of trust you establish, you may be able to take advantage of tax planning strategies that could potentially reduce the tax burden on your estate. Moreover, certain trusts, such as irrevocable trusts, can provide a level of asset protection, shielding them from creditors or legal claims.\n\nRemember, everyone's circumstances are unique, and the laws governing trusts can vary from place to place. It's always wise to consult with a qualified estate planning attorney to understand how a trust can specifically benefit your after-life wishes and ensure your legacy is carried out as you envision.", "You\u2019re right, albeit pedantic. I did not say that. I advised people to set up a trust so that they can have clear discussions and expectations about assets after life. It does not prevent litigation, you\u2019re right, but it certainly makes \u201clife\u201d if you will, a lot easier.", "In some countries that doesn\u2019t work. Where I live the spouse and the kids would both get 50% automatically, this can be reduced to 25%.

Thank you wise one for being so smart. I am so sorry for the personal attack.", "I think it\u2019s disrespectful to the memory of the person who passed. Unless you knew that\u2019s not what they intended, but somehow you ended up with it. Of course you can give some of YOUR money to whoever you want, but to allow it to be seen as an inheritance from someone who didn\u2019t want to leave them an inheritance is disrespectful.", "It\u2019s a difficult choice - particularly when your father definitely wanted to take care of the person who took care of him while he was alive. And felt your brother didn\u2019t deserve his money. \n\nGiving half to your brother feels disrespectful towards your father\u2019s wishes who was likely quite resentful your brother didn\u2019t give a damn about him.\n\nAlso, your brother won\u2019t appreciate anything less that 1/2 and still be angry with you & dad.

As long as the father did not explicit write down not to give his son anything, she is free to share the money with whoever she wants including her brother. \n\n\"He would not have wanted it\" sounds like quite a sad excuse for people who know deep down that what the deceased did was not right. Now they want everybody to know that it is impossible for them to put things right while all that hinders them is their own greed.\n\nThis whole setup is strange, though. Why was/is the relationship between brother and father so bad?  And between brother and her? Was it a bad divorce story and they took different sides? Was she the Golden Child? Did he not live up to his fathers expectations? Was the dad one of those parents who are not able to be interested in a kids life if it does not mach their life? Is the brother gay or something? And where is the mother in all of this? \n\nI am sure that there is more to it than OP wants to tell us.

Drama avoided.", "If a child is literally not mentioned at all in a parents will, it is easy to contest, depending on how the will is written.\n\nFor example, consider a will that said something like \"I leave 100% of my physical property to my progeny, Any_Bread.\" In response to that, the other son can say, \"clearly this was a small mistake where it meant to list both of us after progeny such that it meant to say 'my progeny, Any_Bread and Bad_Son.' In fact he had a conversation with me to that effect and told me he was going to write a new will. I think he probably lost the new will that split property 50/50, or maybe Any_Bread purposefully threw it away.\"\n\nThis is the kind of vengeful things that get said in a probate hearing. As such, what you should do is specifically list assets that will go to specific people and say that it goes to them and them alone, and make sure you list specific people that you are excluding (\"I leave 100% of the house at 1234 Cedar, my corvette, and the boathouse at 567 river road to my child Any_Bread, and Any_Bread alone. Bad_Son gets nothing.\"), though better off is to include some nominal amount so that they don't have reason to contest (e.g., you say they get 5k if they accept, and 0 if they contest, cuz otherwise they have nothing to lose by fighting).\n\nBut yes, probate can be a he-said-she-said affair, so you REALLY want to make sure that you have your ducks in a row if you want to have an uneven distribution among your kids.", "This is a myth.
