My parents were pretty young when they had me 25/26 respectively and my dad was remarried a little over a year later. When I was 3 my younger sister was born and my parents and my maternal family ended up feuding over my maternal family not wanting to form a relationship with my sister and saying they would not be treating the two of us equally. My stepmom ended up adopting me in an effort to sever contact with my maternal side of the family. But my maternal grandparents went to court for grandparents visitation rights which they were granted. Until I was 12 I saw my grandparents one day a month, two days a month on my birthday month and at Christmas when my dad was obligated to let me see them around the Christmas period.\n\nI grew up very close to my maternal family and when I was 12 dad started letting me dictate how much contact I had with them. He didn't like it, I know, but he allowed it because he sensed that I would become resentful of being kept from them when I was so closely bonded with them.\n\nIt has never bothered me that they didn't want to form a relationship with my sister. I get why they would feel that way and I understand why to them, my stepmom and sister are not part of their family. For me there's no big deal in that. It does upset my sister. But I have always assured her I love her and she's not going to lose me. I explained to her that my mom died before I could get to know her and that it's nice being with the people who were very close to her. And that I can ask them questions I can't ask my dad. She didn't understand that because my stepmom adopted me. She believed for so long that it meant my mom was no longer my mom at all and I became her mom's daughter completely.\n\nMy maternal family all planned for this big family vacation in July. They expressed an interest in me going and approached my dad about it. My parents brought it up to me and stated that they did not want me to go, that when my sister heard about it she got very upset and wondered why they still didn't want her now that she's 13 and could go and not be a burden on them. They said they would let me go but they wanted it to be clear that I would be breaking my sister's heart. My stepmom also told me that she wanted me to consider the fact that she had adopted and loved me and accepted me as her daughter and that I still called her my stepmom after all these years and not knowing my mom. She suggested that my maternal family were the reason for that and that it would have been kinder for me to not have any form of attachment to my mom when I can never get to know her. That it would have been kinder to allow me to see her (stepmom) as my only mom.\n\nI chose to go on the vacation and I had a great time. My sister was upset and she even cried a few times afterward. She asked why I left her behind. Why I let her be left out all the time. My parents kept to their word as well and I can tell they are disappointed in me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692261302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15thdze/aita_for_going_on_a_trip_with_my_maternal_family/", "score": 1720, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I never felt like they had more than me or left out even though neither family wanted to get to know me as both relationships ended badly. \n\nIt is your stepmom and dads responsibility to help your sister understand and help her to not feel left out of the situation. \n\nIt\u2019s super sad that they\u2019re trying to manipulate you into not seeing your moms family and sounds super toxic tbh. Sounds liked your step mom feels jealous that your mom is somehow still in your dads life and therefore is indulging your sisters insecurities to pressure you into doing what she wants. \n\nI\u2019d just go live my the maternal family if it carries on. \n\nHope this helps, good luck.", "NTA, this is emotional blackmail. I would even say that your family are being toxic and controlling. You need to hang in there and be yourself, feel and think for yourself.", "NTA- this situation is sad because it didn't have to be this way. Your dad and stepmom have mishandled this, and if you sister is crying, that is your parent's fault, not yours. You've been pretty mature about the whole thing, while they have been fostering unreal expectations in your sister. I hope your sister gets some counseling.\n\nedit- corrected a misspelling", "NTA AT ALL. You have every right in this world to know about your real mom, the woman who gave you life. She died for goodness sake! She didn't just choose to up and leave. Your step mom is extremely cruel to want to take that from you. And shame on your dad allowing it. \n\nYour sister will be fine. Your parents are using and abusing her not explaining the real situation to her. Honestly.. When you're 18 I think you need to go LC and go to court to put your real mom back on your birth certificate.", "NTA - there is so much manipulation here on the adults part, I don't even know where to start. Did your grandparents ever admit to not wanting your sister or is this a story you were fed by your father and stepmom?\n\nTo me, it sounds as though your father moved on rather quickly, and wanted nothing to do with his late wife's family, which is incredibly cruel.  Your dad took you away from your grandparents and couldn't care less these people loved and had bonded with you. Nope, none of that mattered. All that mattered was his new family.\n\nRegardless, your mom will always be your mom. Clearly your stepmother has an issue with this and she is out of her mind. The fact both her and your father went to such lengths to create abandonment issues in your younger sibling, all in the name of control, is beyond disgusting.\n\nPlease understand, their narcissistic behaviour will not stop at your grandparents. It will carry on throughout your life and eventually, you will see it for what it is, but it's going to take you time. From the post, it sounds as though your grandparents love you very much, in a healthy way. Personally, I think you should consider moving in with them at some point. \n\nIf you take anything from my answer, please try and remember that anyone who uses manipulation tactics to motivate certain behaviour in you is not a person you want to be around. This can be a friend, an intimate partner, a sibling and even a parent. Usually when you don't give manipulating people the outcome they expect, you are in for a world of hurt. Good luck to you.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA it sounds like your dad and step mum are feeding your younger sister a narrative to try control you which is only harming her.

It's always the adults' fault, never the children.  If your dad and stepmom hadn't tried to erase your mother and embraced her as a 3rd parent who was simply no longer there, then they wouldn't have so much push back from you.\n\nAlso, your sister has two sets of grandparents, as do you.  Again, it's your parents' fault for setting up your sister for disappointment.  Your parents are trying to emotionally blackmail you by reminding you that it will \"Break your sister's heart\".\n\nYou shouldn't be made to feel guilty by simply wanting to know your mother and her family.", "NTA For 16 and having grown up in that environment you are handling this very maturely. Here are some things to think about why they are/arent or why they should/shouldnt be a certain way:\n\nWhy is your stepmom still being called \"stepmom\" after 15 years? is there any difference in how your sister and you are being treated, or is it just you doing it \"out of principle\"? How hurtful/\"unfair\" is it to your stepmom to be still called that? (for example why is your sister not \"stepsister\"?)\n\nWhy are your grandparents so adamant about not wanting ANYTHING to do with your sister? She isnt \"their granddaughter\", fair, but what if you think about her as a \"very good school friend\", that you happen to live with and spend most of your day/night with. She might not get presents, but why not just let her attend parties as part of \"your group\"? Its your parents they have a problem with, your sister did nothing wrong.\n\nWhy are both your parents putting the blame on you when your sister feels left out of something you do? Why is going with your grandparents different to, i dont know, going on a school trip, she also cant be part of that, right? If you ever get interested in doing a sport, is she gonna feel left out if she doesnt also get to do the same sport, in the same group with the same trainers/people? And why is it YOUR responsibility to address those insecurities of hers?\n\n\n\n\n\nps: if some of the questions indirectly impy one side is clearly in the wrong (like you still calling her stepmom), make it a thought experiment to rephrase it so its the other way around, and see which side of the argument makes more sense.", "NTA for going on this trip (or any other trips) but ALL the adults around should have handled this better. It does sounds like your grandparents never really moved on from your mother dying and therefore couldn't accept that your dad met someone new, remarried and went and had another child. Their lack of acceptance probably resulted in your stepmother adopting you and your parents trying to get away from your maternal family. Which only escaleted things since your grandparents took things to court to get visitations right. Stuck in the middle was you who longed for learning more about a mother you never knew and didn't remember and your little sister not understanding why these people fought so hard for you but didn't want anything to do with her. This all could have been avoided with more communications and more acceptance. Of course you have the right to spend alone time with your maternal grandparents. If they had only accepted your new family and included them in some family gatherings everything could have been so different.\n\nAlso, your stepmom's parents and extended family? Do they treat you and your sister equally and consider you family? If so, this very much explains your sister's reactions. Because than you have MORE people who loves you than she does and to her you are her full sister, nothing else.\n\nA very interested point was also made by your stepmom, how come you don't call her mom? She has been your only mother since you were only a year old and begun forming your language, it would have been natural for you to begin calling her mom (heck, my own child called her best friend's parents mom and dad when she was two since those were the \"names\" her friend used, it's very natural for a child to do so). Someone must have influated you to not do it, maybe even correct you when you DID call her mom (which is very likely you did do as a young child). Something happened there when you were young. Could that have been the reason your parents wanted to sever all contact with your maternal family? Because they objected when you begun to talk and accepted stepmom as your mother?\n\nStill, YOU are of course not the a-hole, but it's very likely the adults in your life are.", "The assholes are your maternal grandparents and your current parents. Not you or your sister.\n\nYour current parents for not allowing you to have proper contact with your mother's side of the family (especially as your mother died when you were so young)\n\nAnd your maternal grandparents because, yes your sister and stepmum aren't related to them, but your sister is still a child and would naturally feel left out her big sister has an extra family she doesn't really understand about (although at 13 she now probably can) and they could have least have been civil to her or met her a few times. \n\nAll four adults between them have caused this mess and led your sister to feel this way rather than being mature and explaining the situation to her and not having a legal mess about your contact with your grandparents, who in turn have ignored her entirely which is never nice, not you. NTA.", "You maternal extended family are T-A. To lose a daughter, then be so obstinate as to refuse to form a relationship with your sister\n\nYour step mom also is T-A. Adoption for the purpose of severing contact with your maternal family is a perverse motivation. To expect that she would become your mother completely and to the exclusion of your birth mother is ridiculous frankly. \n\nYou and your sister are NTA you got dealt a shit hand with your mum dying while you were young and then having the adults and extended family that collectively can\u2019t pull their head out of their ass and behave like decent humans. \n\nIt\u2019s natural for you to want to have a relationship with with your maternal family. \n\nIt\u2019s also natural for your sister to be hurt by their complete refusal to have anything to do with her. Like you can have a relationship with someone who is not a direct blood relative..?\n\nI don\u2019t have advice but the way the \u201cgrown ups\u201d are behaving is toxic.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I personally like the \"school friend\" scenario, so everyone has a picture in their head how they are meant to interact with each other  (2nd grandchild-grandparents vs schoolfriend-grandparents), instead of trying to force either side to choose either-or.\n\nAs for the mom/stepmom thing, if its really just a way to differentiate, how unreasonable is to just say \"fuck it\" and start calling her mom? of couse decide that for yourself, and have the same talk you try to have with your stepmom with your grandparents, about it being \"just a word, it doesnt hold any meaning\". For example, Im thinking how i called a friend \"Robbie\" during childhood, separated after school, and when we now met years later at 25 they asked me to call them \"Rob\" instead, bc they would feel awkward with Robbie, even though thats what i called them for 8+ years.\n\nAll in all, your parents are adults ffs, and your sister will still be a child for a couple years.

Were they expecting him to remain single for the rest of his life? That is something you need to look closely into when you get older. I wouldn't doubt at all that the maternal side kept stating she wasn't your mother, which damaged the family dynamics, and explains why you don't call her mom.  I can totally see why your stepmother is feeling hurt. In regards to your half-sister, she needs to realize she is part of a blended family. Also, blended families usually allow for half siblings to attend some events (not extended holidays), which again shows the skewed family dynamics. Again, the maternal side can't seriously have expected him to not remarry, and if your parents were trying to stop the relationship, it was because of the interference. All the adults at that time should have handled it differently and maybe had a family therapist involved so that all relationships were strong and supportive to the growth of a child.", "You are at the age where you are about to have a lot of relationships and experiences that your sister will not get to participate in.

Ask your dad how he would feel if he died and you were expected to never see his parents or anyone in his family ever again?", "So my thoughts are your moms parents did not want to form a relationship with your sister for a few reasons. 1st -they felt that your step mom was trying to take the place of your mother which by your stepmoms own words she was\n2nd -they may have wanted to create a safe place for you to learn about your mom without fear of your parents adding to or taking away from possibly by using your sister to tell them everything\n\n3rd-by only having you to focus on they can make sure that you are being seen, heard, taught, and spoiled like your mom would want.\n\nAnd lastly- your grandparents went through a massive battle with your parents to just be apart of your life after losing their child they almost lost their grand baby to the last piece of their daughter. The financial and emotional strain would make it hard to deal with your parents I\u2019m sure. Especially if they felt your parents were trying to erase your mom.\n\nI have multiple half siblings and adopted siblings. My mom never tried to take their moms places.

You would never ask her to do that because you would never want her to lose a parent.\n\nGood luck and I may suggest you ask your parents if they are trying to alienate you and make it so you don\u2019t want to interact with them when you are an adult?

They have this dream of a traditional nuclear family and don't want the hassle of dealing with the former spouse or their family.

Number one - is that your grandparents refusal to have any CONTACT (never mind a relationship) with your sister is kinda AHish.  especially now.  You love your sister - would it have bothered you to go on a trip with her?   Why cant they respect your role as sister to this girl?   It wouldnt take much effort to include her - they dont have to call her anything more then \"OP's sister\"\n\nAnd your Dad and adoptive Mom are bigger AH's in my book - to ask that you completely exclude that part of you - to deny a connection between you and your maternal grandparents is unreasonable if that's the path you chose.   Even if you had no maternal family, you still would be curious as you got older.   To ask that you deny it is completely selfish on their part.   Your adoptive mom married a man with a daughter from a previous marriage. she knew this going in.  It was up to her to adapt, NOT manipulate the situation.  If adopting you was an attempt to get you to forget where you came from, even in part, is a little disturbing.   .\n\nThe important thing is you know your own mind.. and you know what you want.

Nobody is obligated to have a relationship with someone they don\u2019t want to, but you did want a relationship with your mom\u2019s family and that should have been respected. \n\nYour dad and stepmom are doing much more harm than good by not explaining these things to your sister, and they\u2019re cause lasting trauma to everyone involved.

I will always prefer your sister over you so you can go rot\"? \n\nYou're right that all the adults here suck.", "Eh, it's unfortunately fairly common for men to remarry stupid fast...especially if there are little kids to be cared for. \n\nI knew an older couple, married for 30+ years, she died and he was remarried in ***2 months***. Gross, but dude couldn't/wouldn't function on his own.", "a year isnt unreasonable - a month would  be suspicious.", "Yeah, like, I can't honestly even blame sis here. Like I said, 13 is kinda the transition away from \"child\", at least in my experience. That's when kids really first start truly separating *their* world view from their parents' world views. \n\nAnd clearly, sis has never had this explained to her, she's never had the opportunity to make peace with the reality she's been dealt. I can't fault her for that at her age, though she will have to adjust as she grows up and learns how complex this world can be. \n\nI don't blame the OP's maternal family either. Sis isn't their relative. Even if Dad had waited whatever their idea of an appropriate amount of time to get remarried was, she's not their relative. They don't have to view her as such. It also doesn't seem like they were actively being cruel to her (I'm picturing a Christmas like the Dursley household in Harry Potter #1) they just... Didn't want to interact with her. \n\nI absolutely blame the parents for setting up their youngest to fail and feel lesser, and for manipulating and attempting to guilt the older kid.", "True and I don't want to be harsh, but even with manipulation a 13 year old should be able to understand basic family structure. There are so many of this type of post on here, and step families are not exactly an unusual situation these days, I despair for people's common sense.", "OP, I LOVE your Mom's parents, Don't ever stop seeing them and loving them, they went to court to see you!!  They fought for you.", "You need to communicate this with your dad. \n\nYou can tell him that you appreciate your stepmom joining the family and taking on a daughter that wasn\u2019t hers, but that you still have a NEED to feel connected to your birth mom. And that need includes being able to talk to him about her.", "I am so sorry. That is really sad.", "Good for you. When you are with your maternal side of the family maybe sit down with them and start a scrapbook of memories of not only your mother but in the short time that you had with her. Also start a scrapbook with the maternal side so that when you get married and have children you can talk about that with your children.\n\nI\u2019m sorry honey, this is awful that you have to go through this both of these people are being toxic and horrible to you. just remember she will always be your mother whether she\u2019s here or not and the more that these two people try and take that away from you the more you\u2019re going to disconnect from them. You should be able to dream about your mother think about your mother and talk about your mother and the fact that they do not allow this makes them horrible people. At least you have your mother side of the family to help and guide you.", "Your stepmom is a piece of work. NTA for going with your family. Your dad is a sucker for falling for her BS.", "I am so glad you saw my comment! And I totally get the looks thing. My husband\u2019s birth parents split up when he was a toddler and he was raised almost entirely by his dad. His two brothers favored the father\u2019s genetics, but my husband inherited the dark hair and stocky build of his mother\u2019s Italian heritage. Luckily, while his mother was pretty much out of the picture across the country growing up, his dad made sure that my hubby spent time with his maternal grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins on a regular basis. It was at one of these meet-ups that hubby learned that his maternal grandfather also did the thing where when he was thinking hard or focusing on a task, he would unconsciously stick his tongue out a little (a human \u201cblep\u201d, as it were). Having connections to family like that is a very important thing.", "I have a feeling this is one of the reasons your stepmom does not like you.", "And what was her role in your life? What type of relationship do you two have? You speak very formarly about a woman who was around when you learned how to walk and talk and every else childhood milestone.", "That\u2019s a pretty mature answer. What it sounds like is that having agency is important to you; Being able to make your own decisions about your life. The way they have taught your sister to believe that it has to either be her or your maternal family is a manipulative tool to deny you agency over your own decisions. It\u2019s an attempt to use guilt to control you. I love my parents, but they\u2019re difficult and I don\u2019t really like them as people. It\u2019s an odd situation, but absolutely possible. My heart goes out to you and I hope that you\u2019re able to find a place of peace. You\u2019re definitely NTA, but your parents are. Start labelling these statements they make as manipulative to remind yourself you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. It may help to shut them down once you call out their behaviour for what it is. You can also start doing this to your sister as she is old enough to start realising the hurt she is causing you.", "She still was adopted when she was a young child and the only one who needed to aprove it then was her dad. So she is in fact OP's mother. But that doesn't take away that OP at one point had another mother, that's after all how adoption works and small children are NEVER consulted about this (in comparison to a 16yo).", "I never said OP can't love her as her mom. I do however understand why mom is upset about being referred to as stepmom.", "The grandparents don't suck at all.  I'm a stepmother and my parents accepted my stepdaughter as a grandchild, which makes sense because they are related by marriage.  My stepdaughter's maternal grandparents have no relationship with my biological daughter.  Why would they?  They aren't related by either blood or by marriage.", "I'd be more worried about her stepmother who adopted OP as an attempt to cut half of her family out of her life, and now guilts OP at every turn and projects her emotional insecurities onto her due to OP still wanting a relationship with her maternal family. That's fucking gross and beyond inappropriate.  OP is also a child who had no choice of her mother dying or her stepmother adopting her. \n\nThere were many ways to handle this so her half sister understands and isn't throwing fits when OP does something with her family, but instead they try to manipulate the situation and guilt OP.", "What are you on. It\u2019s not projecting for the maternal family to not want to have a relationship with a child they have no biological or familiar relationship with. The only person projecting here it\u2019s you. If the parents had done their job as parents this wouldn\u2019t even be an issue.", "So they\u2019re wrong in wanting a relationship with their daughters child? The daughter they lost? Huh?", "I don't understand what your argument is here. Why do you feel that the sister is entitled to a relationship with her half sisters maternal family? Why are they the bad guys for not trying to Foster a relationship with a child they have no relationship with?", "WTF?  NOTHING about the behaviour of OP\u2019s grandparents suggests they are in any way incapable of loving unconditionally or will hurt her some day.\n\nThey have no relationship to the half sister and are in no way obligated to pretend they do.", "Why would they have a relationship with the sister? They have NO, ABSOLUTELY NO, relation to her. She is their ex son in-laws new child. She has nothing to do with their deceased daughter. They owe her nothing. Yes, she is an innocent child, but she is an innocent child who they are not in any way related to.", "The maternal grandparents owe OP step-sister nothing. Child or not they don\u2019t own her anything other than common courtesy.  They lost their child and it doesn\u2019t matter if she was 25, 40 or 60.  The grief is unimaginable and is never gone.  \n\nWhy it is sad?  She is 12 or 13 old enough to understand a. the concept of blended families and b. that they are not her grandparent. Not by blood or marriage.  \n\nHer mother is the problem.  Sh sounds like a spiteful and hatful person who doesn\u2019t care about OP.  She didn\u2019t adopt her out of love but rather out of control.  \n\nShame on her dad for allowing this and shame on all of them for trying to emotionally manipulate OP.\n\nOP is not responsible for her step-sisters feelings.  She is a child herself.", "They tried to erase her mother and her mothers family! To an 11 week old baby.\n\nI\u2019m sure that her stepmom and dad were having an affair and that\u2019s why they wanted to erase her mother side of the family because she will probably eventually find out.\n\nAnyone who would try and erase a mother from a newborns life are hateful toxic people. She had no say in the adoption. I am so glad that the maternal side took action.\n\nI think when she becomes 16 she can be adopted by her maternal side, since she will have a choice at that point but she may have to wait till 18 I don\u2019t know.\n\nShe spends the majority of the time with her half-sister and it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s mean or anything to her. Her grandparents do not have to accept the half sister! She is the step mothers and fathers child not The maternal side.\n\nI think these toxic actions are pushing her towards the maternal side. I\u2019m curious as to how the other grandparents are with her. She should Not be in this position.", "He dated, proposed and married within a year of his wife\u2019s death, that is absolutely unreasonable, lol.", "Sounds like she\u2019s tried and they refuse. That\u2019s the kind of people they are.", "I don\u2019t think op sister will ever understand, in her mind she thinks op stepmom is \u201cop mom\u201d already", "We're close. I love her so much and I consider her one of my parents. There are some things that I'm not totally comfortable with, like the reason for the adoption and her family are not my favorite people (still family just not super into some of the views held within the family). I'm not really sure how to answer. I feel like she's been a mostly good parent and I'm glad she's in my life.", "Yes, she was adopted in an attempt to cut her maternal family out of life. A decision that OP would not choose as an adult. Hence why she views her stepmom as her stepmom, not her mom. Her being her legal mother does not force OP to view her that way or call her mom.", "Again the fact that they tried to isolate you from your maternal family is very suspicious\n\nAnd now it's glaringly obvious that they are using your younger sister, to whom you are attached, to manipulate you\n\nGood for you for taking that vacation and I would be very careful about letting them impose their narrative on you. You're very young and they know your weak spots\n\nBe safe OP. Go live with your maternal family if they keep trying to manipulate you. They're very toxic imo", "That tells you everything you need to know about how crappy these people are.  They had a lot of nerve trying to erase your mother's family from your life.\n\nMethinks this was stepmother trying to erase dad's former life and dad went along with it.\n\nYour sister isn't your mother's family.  Period.   Doesn't she have grandparents from her actual parents?", "FYI, when you\u2019re 18, if you like, you can have your maternal grandparents do an adult adoption. That removes your stepmom as your legal mother.", "Oh I know why they did it but that makes it so much worse. Your stepmom is just a bad person.", "Do what makes you happy! It's not your fault your sister doesn't have a bond with your maternal grandparents. Your dad and stepmum should have both handled this differently. You should get to spend time with your muns family guilt free. Maybe try to have a day you spend with just your sister, and do whatever makes her happy. I'm sorry you've been put in this position, it's not fair to you. NTA, you did nothing wrong.", "Of grandparents rights were already in place it was foolish to think that.", "Well, you have two years or less if you can figure out a legal avenue to get out of the house beforehand. \n\nThe damage your father and stepmother are doing to your sister by encouraging her to feel this way is not your fault. \n\nPlease continue to do exactly what you've been doing completely guilt free.", "That's why it's evident to a lot of people in this thread that your parents are fostering and using your sister's feelings to try and steer you away from your maternal family.\n\nThat is borderline evil.", "Even so, when that baby grows up, they still have the right to know who their biological family is and to at least try to make some sort of connection to them. \n\nThere's just something very shady about the fact that your stepmother wants your grandparents out of your life and she and your dad have used your sister to try to emotionally manipulate you otherwise, and I think you may at least subconciously know it, given the fact that you still call your stepmom by that title rather than \"mom\" and you don't disagree with your grandparents not wanting a relationship with your sister. And then the fact that you went on the trip anyway even after they made a big deal out of pointing out that it would upset your sister.", "They are wrong for making a child feel like shit because of her who mother ISN'T. \n\nI am not projecting. This has never been a situation I've been in. \nHowever I've worked with children who've had adult shit put on them. It's not OK. \n\nA child is a child and should absolutely NOT hold the sins of their parents. And for other adults to solidify that is so gross. \n\nGo work in a treatment center for kids, then come back and tell me this is OK because of reasons\n \ud83d\ude44", "The comment makes it sound like this might be OPs stepmom\u2026", "With out knowing the particulars? - (as we all know how redditors like to make leaps to satisfy their own sordid curiosity)?  Assuming this is NOT an affair situation (not even a hint in that post up there) Its not unreasonable.  Possibly already knew each other?  or maybe met soon after (support group, widows/singles mixer night, wtf/e) .. bonded over supporting grief -  blah blah for 6 months - realized they wanted to be together.. blah blah .. small and easy to schedule wedding (pretty common for what were talking about)  married by a year.   Its just as plausible as the \"knots landing\" version of secret affair/hiding in plain sight/he caused his wifes death/blah blah scenario......   \n\n\nEveryone does grief at their own rate and there's no set time schedule to move on.

Like how OPs dad and stepmom make OP feel like shit because her stepmom isn't her biological mother?  They're putting their adult shit on OP. Theyre guilting her being adopted as if that means OP should cut half her family out.  That's fucking disgusting.

She didn't get to go on a vacation, that's not a traumatizing, life altering situation.

As far as I can see the only people making children feel like shit are the bio dad and stepmum for making one feel bad for having a relationship with their other family, and the other child feeling bad for not being related to them. \nThe stepmum should have encouraged and nurtured the relationship with grandparents, who doesn\u2019t want their child to have lots of people who love them? And explained to the other child that they\u2019re lucky to have their own bio family together whilst their siblings own mother is dead.
