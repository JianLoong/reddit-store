My parents were pretty young when they had me 25/26 respectively and my dad was remarried a little over a year later. When I was 3 my younger sister was born and my parents and my maternal family ended up feuding over my maternal family not wanting to form a relationship with my sister and saying they would not be treating the two of us equally. My stepmom ended up adopting me in an effort to sever contact with my maternal side of the family. But my maternal grandparents went to court for grandparents visitation rights which they were granted. Until I was 12 I saw my grandparents one day a month, two days a month on my birthday month and at Christmas when my dad was obligated to let me see them around the Christmas period.\n\nI grew up very close to my maternal family and when I was 12 dad started letting me dictate how much contact I had with them. He didn't like it, I know, but he allowed it because he sensed that I would become resentful of being kept from them when I was so closely bonded with them.\n\nIt has never bothered me that they didn't want to form a relationship with my sister. I get why they would feel that way and I understand why to them, my stepmom and sister are not part of their family. For me there's no big deal in that. It does upset my sister. But I have always assured her I love her and she's not going to lose me. I explained to her that my mom died before I could get to know her and that it's nice being with the people who were very close to her. And that I can ask them questions I can't ask my dad. She didn't understand that because my stepmom adopted me. She believed for so long that it meant my mom was no longer my mom at all and I became her mom's daughter completely.\n\nMy maternal family all planned for this big family vacation in July. They expressed an interest in me going and approached my dad about it. My parents brought it up to me and stated that they did not want me to go, that when my sister heard about it she got very upset and wondered why they still didn't want her now that she's 13 and could go and not be a burden on them. They said they would let me go but they wanted it to be clear that I would be breaking my sister's heart. My stepmom also told me that she wanted me to consider the fact that she had adopted and loved me and accepted me as her daughter and that I still called her my stepmom after all these years and not knowing my mom. She suggested that my maternal family were the reason for that and that it would have been kinder for me to not have any form of attachment to my mom when I can never get to know her. That it would have been kinder to allow me to see her (stepmom) as my only mom.\n\nI chose to go on the vacation and I had a great time. My sister was upset and she even cried a few times afterward. She asked why I left her behind. Why I let her be left out all the time. My parents kept to their word as well and I can tell they are disappointed in me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692261302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15thdze/aita_for_going_on_a_trip_with_my_maternal_family/", "score": 3943, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I never felt like they had more than me or left out even though neither family wanted to get to know me as both relationships ended badly. \n\nIt is your stepmom and dads responsibility to help your sister understand and help her to not feel left out of the situation. \n\nIt\u2019s super sad that they\u2019re trying to manipulate you into not seeing your moms family and sounds super toxic tbh. Sounds liked your step mom feels jealous that your mom is somehow still in your dads life and therefore is indulging your sisters insecurities to pressure you into doing what she wants. \n\nI\u2019d just go live my the maternal family if it carries on. \n\nHope this helps, good luck.", "NTA, this is emotional blackmail. I would even say that your family are being toxic and controlling. You need to hang in there and be yourself, feel and think for yourself.", "NTA- this situation is sad because it didn't have to be this way. Your dad and stepmom have mishandled this, and if you sister is crying, that is your parent's fault, not yours. You've been pretty mature about the whole thing, while they have been fostering unreal expectations in your sister. I hope your sister gets some counseling.\n\nedit- corrected a misspelling", "NTA AT ALL. You have every right in this world to know about your real mom, the woman who gave you life. She died for goodness sake! She didn't just choose to up and leave. Your step mom is extremely cruel to want to take that from you. And shame on your dad allowing it. \n\nYour sister will be fine. Your parents are using and abusing her not explaining the real situation to her. Honestly.. When you're 18 I think you need to go LC and go to court to put your real mom back on your birth certificate.", "NTA - there is so much manipulation here on the adults part, I don't even know where to start. Did your grandparents ever admit to not wanting your sister or is this a story you were fed by your father and stepmom?\n\nTo me, it sounds as though your father moved on rather quickly, and wanted nothing to do with his late wife's family, which is incredibly cruel.  Your dad took you away from your grandparents and couldn't care less these people loved and had bonded with you. Nope, none of that mattered. All that mattered was his new family.\n\nRegardless, your mom will always be your mom. Clearly your stepmother has an issue with this and she is out of her mind. The fact both her and your father went to such lengths to create abandonment issues in your younger sibling, all in the name of control, is beyond disgusting.\n\nPlease understand, their narcissistic behaviour will not stop at your grandparents. It will carry on throughout your life and eventually, you will see it for what it is, but it's going to take you time. From the post, it sounds as though your grandparents love you very much, in a healthy way. Personally, I think you should consider moving in with them at some point. \n\nIf you take anything from my answer, please try and remember that anyone who uses manipulation tactics to motivate certain behaviour in you is not a person you want to be around. This can be a friend, an intimate partner, a sibling and even a parent. Usually when you don't give manipulating people the outcome they expect, you are in for a world of hurt. Good luck to you.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA it sounds like your dad and step mum are feeding your younger sister a narrative to try control you which is only harming her.

It's always the adults' fault, never the children.  If your dad and stepmom hadn't tried to erase your mother and embraced her as a 3rd parent who was simply no longer there, then they wouldn't have so much push back from you.\n\nAlso, your sister has two sets of grandparents, as do you.  Again, it's your parents' fault for setting up your sister for disappointment.  Your parents are trying to emotionally blackmail you by reminding you that it will \"Break your sister's heart\".\n\nYou shouldn't be made to feel guilty by simply wanting to know your mother and her family.", "NTA For 16 and having grown up in that environment you are handling this very maturely. Here are some things to think about why they are/arent or why they should/shouldnt be a certain way:\n\nWhy is your stepmom still being called \"stepmom\" after 15 years? is there any difference in how your sister and you are being treated, or is it just you doing it \"out of principle\"? How hurtful/\"unfair\" is it to your stepmom to be still called that? (for example why is your sister not \"stepsister\"?)\n\nWhy are your grandparents so adamant about not wanting ANYTHING to do with your sister? She isnt \"their granddaughter\", fair, but what if you think about her as a \"very good school friend\", that you happen to live with and spend most of your day/night with. She might not get presents, but why not just let her attend parties as part of \"your group\"? Its your parents they have a problem with, your sister did nothing wrong.\n\nWhy are both your parents putting the blame on you when your sister feels left out of something you do? Why is going with your grandparents different to, i dont know, going on a school trip, she also cant be part of that, right? If you ever get interested in doing a sport, is she gonna feel left out if she doesnt also get to do the same sport, in the same group with the same trainers/people? And why is it YOUR responsibility to address those insecurities of hers?\n\n\n\n\n\nps: if some of the questions indirectly impy one side is clearly in the wrong (like you still calling her stepmom), make it a thought experiment to rephrase it so its the other way around, and see which side of the argument makes more sense.", "NTA for going on this trip (or any other trips) but ALL the adults around should have handled this better. It does sounds like your grandparents never really moved on from your mother dying and therefore couldn't accept that your dad met someone new, remarried and went and had another child. Their lack of acceptance probably resulted in your stepmother adopting you and your parents trying to get away from your maternal family. Which only escaleted things since your grandparents took things to court to get visitations right. Stuck in the middle was you who longed for learning more about a mother you never knew and didn't remember and your little sister not understanding why these people fought so hard for you but didn't want anything to do with her. This all could have been avoided with more communications and more acceptance. Of course you have the right to spend alone time with your maternal grandparents. If they had only accepted your new family and included them in some family gatherings everything could have been so different.\n\nAlso, your stepmom's parents and extended family? Do they treat you and your sister equally and consider you family? If so, this very much explains your sister's reactions. Because than you have MORE people who loves you than she does and to her you are her full sister, nothing else.\n\nA very interested point was also made by your stepmom, how come you don't call her mom? She has been your only mother since you were only a year old and begun forming your language, it would have been natural for you to begin calling her mom (heck, my own child called her best friend's parents mom and dad when she was two since those were the \"names\" her friend used, it's very natural for a child to do so). Someone must have influated you to not do it, maybe even correct you when you DID call her mom (which is very likely you did do as a young child). Something happened there when you were young. Could that have been the reason your parents wanted to sever all contact with your maternal family? Because they objected when you begun to talk and accepted stepmom as your mother?\n\nStill, YOU are of course not the a-hole, but it's very likely the adults in your life are.", "The assholes are your maternal grandparents and your current parents. Not you or your sister.\n\nYour current parents for not allowing you to have proper contact with your mother's side of the family (especially as your mother died when you were so young)\n\nAnd your maternal grandparents because, yes your sister and stepmum aren't related to them, but your sister is still a child and would naturally feel left out her big sister has an extra family she doesn't really understand about (although at 13 she now probably can) and they could have least have been civil to her or met her a few times. \n\nAll four adults between them have caused this mess and led your sister to feel this way rather than being mature and explaining the situation to her and not having a legal mess about your contact with your grandparents, who in turn have ignored her entirely which is never nice, not you. NTA.", "You maternal extended family are T-A. To lose a daughter, then be so obstinate as to refuse to form a relationship with your sister\n\nYour step mom also is T-A. Adoption for the purpose of severing contact with your maternal family is a perverse motivation. To expect that she would become your mother completely and to the exclusion of your birth mother is ridiculous frankly. \n\nYou and your sister are NTA you got dealt a shit hand with your mum dying while you were young and then having the adults and extended family that collectively can\u2019t pull their head out of their ass and behave like decent humans. \n\nIt\u2019s natural for you to want to have a relationship with with your maternal family. \n\nIt\u2019s also natural for your sister to be hurt by their complete refusal to have anything to do with her. Like you can have a relationship with someone who is not a direct blood relative..?\n\nI don\u2019t have advice but the way the \u201cgrown ups\u201d are behaving is toxic.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I personally like the \"school friend\" scenario, so everyone has a picture in their head how they are meant to interact with each other  (2nd grandchild-grandparents vs schoolfriend-grandparents), instead of trying to force either side to choose either-or.\n\nAs for the mom/stepmom thing, if its really just a way to differentiate, how unreasonable is to just say \"fuck it\" and start calling her mom? of couse decide that for yourself, and have the same talk you try to have with your stepmom with your grandparents, about it being \"just a word, it doesnt hold any meaning\". For example, Im thinking how i called a friend \"Robbie\" during childhood, separated after school, and when we now met years later at 25 they asked me to call them \"Rob\" instead, bc they would feel awkward with Robbie, even though thats what i called them for 8+ years.\n\nAll in all, your parents are adults ffs, and your sister will still be a child for a couple years.

Were they expecting him to remain single for the rest of his life? That is something you need to look closely into when you get older. I wouldn't doubt at all that the maternal side kept stating she wasn't your mother, which damaged the family dynamics, and explains why you don't call her mom.  I can totally see why your stepmother is feeling hurt. In regards to your half-sister, she needs to realize she is part of a blended family. Also, blended families usually allow for half siblings to attend some events (not extended holidays), which again shows the skewed family dynamics. Again, the maternal side can't seriously have expected him to not remarry, and if your parents were trying to stop the relationship, it was because of the interference. All the adults at that time should have handled it differently and maybe had a family therapist involved so that all relationships were strong and supportive to the growth of a child.", "You are at the age where you are about to have a lot of relationships and experiences that your sister will not get to participate in.

Ask your dad how he would feel if he died and you were expected to never see his parents or anyone in his family ever again?", "So my thoughts are your moms parents did not want to form a relationship with your sister for a few reasons. 1st -they felt that your step mom was trying to take the place of your mother which by your stepmoms own words she was\n2nd -they may have wanted to create a safe place for you to learn about your mom without fear of your parents adding to or taking away from possibly by using your sister to tell them everything\n\n3rd-by only having you to focus on they can make sure that you are being seen, heard, taught, and spoiled like your mom would want.\n\nAnd lastly- your grandparents went through a massive battle with your parents to just be apart of your life after losing their child they almost lost their grand baby to the last piece of their daughter. The financial and emotional strain would make it hard to deal with your parents I\u2019m sure. Especially if they felt your parents were trying to erase your mom.\n\nI have multiple half siblings and adopted siblings. My mom never tried to take their moms places.

You would never ask her to do that because you would never want her to lose a parent.\n\nGood luck and I may suggest you ask your parents if they are trying to alienate you and make it so you don\u2019t want to interact with them when you are an adult?

They have this dream of a traditional nuclear family and don't want the hassle of dealing with the former spouse or their family.

Number one - is that your grandparents refusal to have any CONTACT (never mind a relationship) with your sister is kinda AHish.  especially now.  You love your sister - would it have bothered you to go on a trip with her?   Why cant they respect your role as sister to this girl?   It wouldnt take much effort to include her - they dont have to call her anything more then \"OP's sister\"\n\nAnd your Dad and adoptive Mom are bigger AH's in my book - to ask that you completely exclude that part of you - to deny a connection between you and your maternal grandparents is unreasonable if that's the path you chose.   Even if you had no maternal family, you still would be curious as you got older.   To ask that you deny it is completely selfish on their part.   Your adoptive mom married a man with a daughter from a previous marriage. she knew this going in.  It was up to her to adapt, NOT manipulate the situation.  If adopting you was an attempt to get you to forget where you came from, even in part, is a little disturbing.   .\n\nThe important thing is you know your own mind.. and you know what you want.

Nobody is obligated to have a relationship with someone they don\u2019t want to, but you did want a relationship with your mom\u2019s family and that should have been respected. \n\nYour dad and stepmom are doing much more harm than good by not explaining these things to your sister, and they\u2019re cause lasting trauma to everyone involved.

I can't fault her for that at her age, though she will have to adjust as she grows up and learns how complex this world can be. \n\nI don't blame the OP's maternal family either. Sis isn't their relative. Even if Dad had waited whatever their idea of an appropriate amount of time to get remarried was, she's not their relative. They don't have to view her as such.

But that shouldn\u2019t prevent you from going on a trip with your other relatives.", "NTA - your step mom obviously loves you though, you should know that", "NTA\n\nHowever I can genuinely see both sides here, and I can see how your sister feels left out.", "NTA- maternal family a little weird for being that weird about including your younger sister. (I\u2019m your younger sister in this exact situation and I get treated a little different by my sisters grandparents but I\u2019m still invited and I can still call them grandma/pa.) I can also see how this would hurt your sisters feelings but she shouldn\u2019t blame you for it. Same with your parents they seem dramatic as hell. I also think it\u2019s weird you call your step mom step mom instead of mom and how that would be hurtful to her. My sister calls my dad dad because her real dad passed away when she was 3 months. He never actually legally adopted her but he raised her as her father figure. Calling your step mom \u201cmom\u201d doesn\u2019t make your real mom any less of your mom. You can have two moms. Once again though your family is making this way too big a deal. If you don\u2019t wanna call her mom (I see how it can be hurtful) then whatever and if your maternal family doesn\u2019t want anything to do with your sister fudge them. (The maternal family not wanting anything to do with your sister feels like they\u2019re punishing a kid because they\u2019re upset your father moved on after their daughters passing.) You shouldn\u2019t punish kids and people should be aloud to move on. Kinda dislike all ur family maternal and not. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong though.", "NTA. I do think your grandparents are being assholes to yur sister. But I do not believe that having  relationship with them is bad. Maybe you could speak up for your sister more, but wanting to have a relationship with your mother family makes sense.  \n\n\noh forgot to mention, your current parents are definitely being assholes too. As others mentioned, this is emotional blackmail and super toxic.", " >1 year and 11 weeks old when step mom came into the picture\n\nI'm not sure where you got that from because that's not what the post says. Unless they met and got married in a matter of months", "I was also shocked when my son's birth certificate was changed when my husband adopted him. It's saved me from sending in a ton of additional paperwork, though. \n\nIt was really handy when we've signed him up under my husband's insurance, passports, school, etc. Adoption paperwork is quite easy to fake if you have the desire. Seriously, my official copy has a rubber stamp and a signature. Thats all. Birth Certificates are slightly more difficult to fake, at least in my state.\n\nI've also saved all 3 of his birth certificates just in case he wanted them. 1st without a father, 2nd with his bio dad, and 3rd with my husband.", "It sounds like they need to learn about the ring theory of support. You, having lost your mother at a very young age, should be in the center of the rings (along with your bereaved grandparents), and thus what is kinder *to you* should be prioritized when it comes to this issue.", "Dude they are trying real hard to gaslight you huh", "Not kind, convenient. They frame it as kindness to manipulate you into a sense of obligation.", "I think that might be what confuses the little sister, they probaby share 4 grandparents and she doesn't get why her sister gets 2 bonus grandparents or why can't they include her like her bio grandparents do. It's a different situation and difficult for a child at 13 especially with manipulative parents involved.", "[deleted]", "You're making quite a few assumptions here, while not addressing the fact that OP doesn't call her stepmother her mom. \n\nWe (and OP) don't really know the particulars of what happened when she was a baby. We only know how OP interprets the outcome.\n\nYou ask why her stepmother feels threatened by the grandparents, and the crystal clear, simple answer is that she believed that they would undermine her relationship with OP. \n\nOP doesn't call the woman who raised her in all of her living memory, mom. Her stepmother clearly considers OP to be her daughter, OP doesn't consider her stepmother to be her mother. Whether that is because of her grandparents, well come on there are not many reasonable explanations beyond that....\n\nIf we flip the script and OP's stepmother calls her her stepdaughter, everyone would agree that she's an evil wicked woman who resents OP for whatever reason. \n\nSo now we have this story of conflict between a stepmother who took over the reins months into a newborn's life, and the baby's grandparents. And the grandparents have been so worried about their granddaughter forgetting her 'real mother' that she doesn't call the woman who raised her, mom.\n\nAgain, you asked why her stepmother felt threatened. This is the most logical explanation of why.", "YES! The normal issue that the stepmother of motherless children is facing is that the late mother is idolised, both by the children and husband. WHY doesn't he want to honor her memory at all? This sounds ... strange.", "Right, so the step mom probably came into the picture much earlier than 1 year ago 11 weeks", "Imagine being so bad at parenting that the daughter who has two living parents is \u201csuffering\u201d more than the daughter who lost her mom as an infant.", "It\u2019s not even that, he actually HATES her and OP can\u2019t even talk about her. Why is that? It\u2019s one thing if he didn\u2019t like his in-laws and wasn\u2019t keen to stay close, but he should have still held some affection for his first wife. That\u2019s where truth of this entire situation lies. It could be that there wasn\u2019t an affair but that SM is extremely toxic and manipulative and tried to replace her and pissed it didn\u2019t work with OP.", ">She believed for so long that it meant my mom was no longer my mom at all and I became her mom's daughter completely.\n\nThis is the problem. She grew up being told that OP's bio mom didn't exist. I'm actually not sure if she knew that OP was adopted at all or if that's just OP's interpretation of how the sis thought adoption worked. So at 13 it's hard to disentangle this web of lies and manipulation get parents spun", "I didn't know you could nullify an adoption, how interesting.  Thanks for teaching me that \ud83d\ude42", "NTA. My mother died when I was very young & I have few clear memories of her. Dad remarried 8 years later. Stepmom told my sister & me that she would never try to replace our mother & said we could call her whatever we chose. All of Mom\u2019s photos stayed in place in the house & SM never tried to take over our lives. \n\nYour mother is your mother & you deserve to know what you can know of her through your maternal family. No one should try to take that from you. I\u2019m sorry for your sister, but this whole thing has been perpetuated by your dad & stepmother. They seriously need to back off of this argument.", "ESH - You and your grandparents anyway.  It's understandable that your immediate family is hurt. \n\nYour grandparents kinda suck.  That's why your parents don't get along with them.  Your grandparents luring you away with a vacation that your sister isn't welcome on is a punk move.  You're only 16 so you're off the hook but it's time to see that your grandparents aren't cool. Time to tell your dad, sister and step mom that you understand that your grandparents put you in this awkward situation and that you're sorry and tell grandparents that you love them but they're punks for rejecting your sister and putting you in that situation.", "OPs mom is dead not the 13 year olds. The 13 year olds mom is OPs stepmom more like stepmonster. Still the 13 year old should understand that her sister (OP) has a different bio mom that has relatives that OP has a relationship with and does things with and gets things from. I can understand why that is difficult for the 13 year old-her mom is putting it in her head that OPs bio moms family owes her (the 13 year old) a relationship and things)\n\nSoooo NTA OP but your dad and stepmonster are soooo YTA.", "I think it's highly likely to be informed by the father and wife trying to cut them off. That changes things quite a lot IMO.", "Yes I know, her little sisters internal monologue at 13 should be \u201cI know her bio/real mom is dead, and this is the only way for her to connect with her moms family and get closure of some kind\u201d at thirteen those are some pretty easy ass dots to connect.", "I don't read it that way. According to the OP the arguments started when the grandparents wouldn't treat the two children the same.  \n\n\"When I was 3 my younger sister was born and my parents and my maternal family ended up feuding over my maternal family not wanting to form a relationship with my sister and saying they would not be treating the two of us equally.\"\n\nThe parents tried to cut them off after that happened.", "OP explained that this was to try to cut off the maternal family, which is gross, but before I read that, this didn't necessarily act as a red flag to me; it could have been to establish herself as OP's guardian/legal parent in case OP's dad passed away, and they wanted her to have custody to keep the sisters together.", "NTA\n\nYour stepmom is a piece of work and your dad is a useless enabler. It\u2019s upsetting that your stepmom pushed to adopt you and why she did it. I\u2019m sorry. This has been completely unfair to you.", "Hey, sweetie. \nI'm so sorry this is happening to you. Imma stick up a little for your parents. There's is soooo much more than your dad just not wanting you to have no contact with Mom's family. You said your mama passed when you were only 11 weeks old. Imagine all the grief your dad went through... Then, he married somewhat quickly. Maybe trying  to \"forget\" his past (your mom), and to do that is to cut loose ties (your mama's family) to soothe the pain. As for your step/adoptive mom (just theorizing here), she struggled to have children until your sister, which made you her \"miracle baby,\" but with your mama's family in the picture she is reminded that some else was the reason for your life AND a reminder that your father had someone before her.  I totally think family therapy is in order. They are so blinded that they don't see that their actions are going to make them lose you and break whatever bond you have with your sister. Don't be afraid to express what you feel to them because if you don't, it is/will get worse. Maybe start by showing your post to them, letting them know how you feel about Mama's family, and having them in your life is like mama is with you, and having adopted mom is the biggest blessing in your life. I hope this helps. Wishing you much love, success, and happiness!", "So sad. Then he needs to accept that if she can\u2019t get that need met with him, then she\u2019s going to get it met with bio mom\u2019s side of the family.", "She may be young but I am struck by the emotional maturity in her post. I can think of many adults that don\u2019t have her level of emotional intelligence or such a developed sense of empathy. \n\nThat couple of manipulative arsehole parents of hers for example, would do well to emulate OP.\n\nIt\u2019s bloody shocking that OP has had to repeatedly have conversations with her sister about families and about love and providing her sister with reassurance that love is not a finite quantity that must be taken from one if we are to love another. Conversations that should have come regularly from her actual parents. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I could do better myself in how she has approached her sister\u2019s (clearly externally conditioned) insecurities. I\u2019m sure OP\u2019s maternal family are proud of how kind she is as a person.\n\nI know that I personally would be proud to have a daughter so abundant in these qualities. \n\nQualities I might add, that OP clearly inherits from her mother and not from her father. \n\nNTA. There\u2019s no need to doubt yourself in this OP. Carry on."]}
