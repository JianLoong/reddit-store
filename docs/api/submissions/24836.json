My parents were pretty young when they had me 25/26 respectively and my dad was remarried a little over a year later. When I was 3 my younger sister was born and my parents and my maternal family ended up feuding over my maternal family not wanting to form a relationship with my sister and saying they would not be treating the two of us equally. My stepmom ended up adopting me in an effort to sever contact with my maternal side of the family. But my maternal grandparents went to court for grandparents visitation rights which they were granted. Until I was 12 I saw my grandparents one day a month, two days a month on my birthday month and at Christmas when my dad was obligated to let me see them around the Christmas period.\n\nI grew up very close to my maternal family and when I was 12 dad started letting me dictate how much contact I had with them. He didn't like it, I know, but he allowed it because he sensed that I would become resentful of being kept from them when I was so closely bonded with them.\n\nIt has never bothered me that they didn't want to form a relationship with my sister. I get why they would feel that way and I understand why to them, my stepmom and sister are not part of their family. For me there's no big deal in that. It does upset my sister. But I have always assured her I love her and she's not going to lose me. I explained to her that my mom died before I could get to know her and that it's nice being with the people who were very close to her. And that I can ask them questions I can't ask my dad. She didn't understand that because my stepmom adopted me. She believed for so long that it meant my mom was no longer my mom at all and I became her mom's daughter completely.\n\nMy maternal family all planned for this big family vacation in July. They expressed an interest in me going and approached my dad about it. My parents brought it up to me and stated that they did not want me to go, that when my sister heard about it she got very upset and wondered why they still didn't want her now that she's 13 and could go and not be a burden on them. They said they would let me go but they wanted it to be clear that I would be breaking my sister's heart. My stepmom also told me that she wanted me to consider the fact that she had adopted and loved me and accepted me as her daughter and that I still called her my stepmom after all these years and not knowing my mom. She suggested that my maternal family were the reason for that and that it would have been kinder for me to not have any form of attachment to my mom when I can never get to know her. That it would have been kinder to allow me to see her (stepmom) as my only mom.\n\nI chose to go on the vacation and I had a great time. My sister was upset and she even cried a few times afterward. She asked why I left her behind. Why I let her be left out all the time. My parents kept to their word as well and I can tell they are disappointed in me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692261302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15thdze/aita_for_going_on_a_trip_with_my_maternal_family/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I never felt like they had more than me or left out even though neither family wanted to get to know me as both relationships ended badly. \n\nIt is your stepmom and dads responsibility to help your sister understand and help her to not feel left out of the situation. \n\nIt\u2019s super sad that they\u2019re trying to manipulate you into not seeing your moms family and sounds super toxic tbh. Sounds liked your step mom feels jealous that your mom is somehow still in your dads life and therefore is indulging your sisters insecurities to pressure you into doing what she wants. \n\nI\u2019d just go live my the maternal family if it carries on. \n\nHope this helps, good luck.", "NTA, this is emotional blackmail. I would even say that your family are being toxic and controlling. You need to hang in there and be yourself, feel and think for yourself.", "NTA- this situation is sad because it didn't have to be this way. Your dad and stepmom have mishandled this, and if you sister is crying, that is your parent's fault, not yours. You've been pretty mature about the whole thing, while they have been fostering unreal expectations in your sister. I hope your sister bets some counseling.", "NTA AT ALL. You have every right in this world to know about your real mom, the woman who gave you life. She died for goodness sake! She didn't just choose to up and leave. Your step mom is extremely cruel to want to take that from you. And shame on your dad allowing it. \n\nYour sister will be fine. Your parents are using and abusing her not explaining the real situation to her. Honestly.. When you're 18 I think you need to go LC and go to court to put your real mom back on your birth certificate.", "NTA - there is so much manipulation here on the adults part, I don't even know where to start. Did your grandparents ever admit to not wanting your sister or is this a story you were fed by your father and stepmom?\n\nTo me, it sounds as though your father moved on rather quickly, and wanted nothing to do with his late wife's family, which is incredibly cruel.  Your dad took you away from your grandparents and couldn't care less these people loved and had bonded with you. Nope, none of that mattered. All that mattered was his new family.\n\nRegardless, your mom will always be your mom. Clearly your stepmother has an issue with this and she is out of her mind. The fact both her and your father went to such lengths to create abandonment issues in your younger sibling, all in the name of control, is beyond disgusting.\n\nPlease understand, their narcissistic behaviour will not stop at your grandparents. It will carry on throughout your life and eventually, you will see it for what it is, but it's going to take you time. From the post, it sounds as though your grandparents love you very much, in a healthy way. Personally, I think you should consider moving in with them at some point. \n\nIf you take anything from my answer, please try and remember that anyone who uses manipulation tactics to motivate certain behaviour in you is not a person you want to be around. This can be a friend, an intimate partner, a sibling and even a parent. Usually when you don't give manipulating people the outcome they expect, you are in for a world of hurt. Good luck to you.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA it sounds like your dad and step mum are feeding your younger sister a narrative to try control you which is only harming her.

That\u2019s weird and WRONG.", "Here\u2019s a question - would you trade situations with her, having a living mom while she has grandparents who don\u2019t include you?  I\u2019m thinking you would.

What about your heart? Don't your feelings matter?\n\nDoes your dad not care that your mum would be so disappointed to see him treat her parents like that? \n\nTell your parents to step up and treat your little sister to soften the blow and stop feeding into her jealousy.

It's always the adults' fault, never the children.  If your dad and stepmom hadn't tried to erase your mother and embraced her as a 3rd parent who was simply no longer there, then they wouldn't have so much push back from you.\n\nAlso, your sister has two sets of grandparents, as do you.  Again, it's your parents' fault for setting up your sister for disappointment.  Your parents are trying to emotionally blackmail you by reminding you that it will \"Break your sister's heart\".\n\nYou shouldn't be made to feel guilty by simply wanting to know your mother and her family.", "NTA For 16 and having grown up in that environment you are handling this very maturely. Here are some things to think about why they are/arent or why they should/shouldnt be a certain way:\n\nWhy is your stepmom still being called \"stepmom\" after 15 years? is there any difference in how your sister and you are being treated, or is it just you doing it \"out of principle\"? How hurtful/\"unfair\" is it to your stepmom to be still called that? (for example why is your sister not \"stepsister\"?)\n\nWhy are your grandparents so adamant about not wanting ANYTHING to do with your sister? She isnt \"their granddaughter\", fair, but what if you think about her as a \"very good school friend\", that you happen to live with and spend most of your day/night with. She might not get presents, but why not just let her attend parties as part of \"your group\"? Its your parents they have a problem with, your sister did nothing wrong.\n\nWhy are both your parents putting the blame on you when your sister feels left out of something you do? Why is going with your grandparents different to, i dont know, going on a school trip, she also cant be part of that, right? If you ever get interested in doing a sport, is she gonna feel left out if she doesnt also get to do the same sport, in the same group with the same trainers/people? And why is it YOUR responsibility to address those insecurities of hers?\n\n\n\n\n\nps: if some of the questions indirectly impy one side is clearly in the wrong (like you still calling her stepmom), make it a thought experiment to rephrase it so its the other way around, and see which side of the argument makes more sense.", "NTA for going on this trip (or any other trips) but ALL the adults around should have handled this better. It does sounds like your grandparents never really moved on from your mother dying and therefore couldn't accept that your dad met someone new, remarried and went and had another child. Their lack of acceptance probably resulted in your stepmother adopting you and your parents trying to get away from your maternal family. Which only escaleted things since your grandparents took things to court to get visitations right. Stuck in the middle was you who longed for learning more about a mother you never knew and didn't remember and your little sister not understanding why these people fought so hard for you but didn't want anything to do with her. This all could have been avoided with more communications and more acceptance. Of course you have the right to spend alone time with your maternal grandparents. If they had only accepted your new family and included them in some family gatherings everything could have been so different.\n\nAlso, your stepmom's parents and extended family? Do they treat you and your sister equally and consider you family? If so, this very much explains your sister's reactions. Because than you have MORE people who loves you than she does and to her you are her full sister, nothing else.\n\nA very interested point was also made by your stepmom, how come you don't call her mom? She has been your only mother since you were only a year old and begun forming your language, it would have been natural for you to begin calling her mom (heck, my own child called her best friend's parents mom and dad when she was two since those were the \"names\" her friend used, it's very natural for a child to do so). Someone must have influated you to not do it, maybe even correct you when you DID call her mom (which is very likely you did do as a young child). Something happened there when you were young. Could that have been the reason your parents wanted to sever all contact with your maternal family? Because they objected when you begun to talk and accepted stepmom as your mother?\n\nStill, YOU are of course not the a-hole, but it's very likely the adults in your life are.", "The assholes are your maternal grandparents and your current parents. Not you or your sister.\n\nYour current parents for not allowing you to have proper contact with your mother's side of the family (especially as your mother died when you were so young)\n\nAnd your maternal grandparents because, yes your sister and stepmum aren't related to them, but your sister is still a child and would naturally feel left out her big sister has an extra family she doesn't really understand about (although at 13 she now probably can) and they could have least have been civil to her or met her a few times. \n\nAll four adults between them have caused this mess and led your sister to feel this way rather than being mature and explaining the situation to her and not having a legal mess about your contact with your grandparents, who in turn have ignored her entirely which is never nice, not you. NTA.", "You maternal extended family are T-A. To lose a daughter, then be so obstinate as to refuse to form a relationship with your sister\n\nYour step mom also is T-A. Adoption for the purpose of severing contact with your maternal family is a perverse motivation. To expect that she would become your mother completely and to the exclusion of your birth mother is ridiculous frankly. \n\nYou and your sister are NTA you got dealt a shit hand with your mum dying while you were young and then having the adults and extended family that collectively can\u2019t pull their head out of their ass and behave like decent humans. \n\nIt\u2019s natural for you to want to have a relationship with with your maternal family. \n\nIt\u2019s also natural for your sister to be hurt by their complete refusal to have anything to do with her. Like you can have a relationship with someone who is not a direct blood relative..?\n\nI don\u2019t have advice but the way the \u201cgrown ups\u201d are behaving is toxic.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That person is a child and that sort of treatment has an impact.", "Yes thank you I acknowledged my mistake in response to OPs comment.", "Sounds like dad tried to stop op from seeing their grandparents, but they went to court and legally forced him not to alienate their granddaughter from them. The times he did allow her to see them was due to being legally forced. Had he pushed it when she was 12, she could have legally requested to live with them. The stepmother and father in this situation are extremely manipulating.", "I do those kinds of things with my sister anyway. But she still feels insecure and upset and generally has trouble with me having my maternal family in my life. Makes me sad because I don't want her to hurt but I refuse to give up my maternal family either.", "I have never been to therapy and no. We don't honor my mom at all. I will sometimes mention her but she's a sore topic for my parents so I save all my questions and wants to talk about her with my maternal family.", "It's the dad and the stepmom who are setting the younger sister up for disappointment.\n\nThe Maternal family were clear from the beginning.  They have no obligation to the younger sister.", "the parents are stepping in, it sounds like. and they\u2019re telling her that op wanting a relationship with her family is wrong, and that not replacing even the memory of her mom with stepmom is hurtful. what can op really do, when this kid\u2019s parents are filling her head with this awful ghoulish thinking? op, your mother dying does not mean she never existed, it does not mean your family through her should not be allowed to *be your family* and your father decising to re-marry is good for him, but has nothing to do with your maternal family and does not require action on their part. nta.", "They are absolutely not.     \n\nThe child is nothing to the Maternal side and sister needs to get over herself and go to therapy. She is not entitled to a 3rd set of GPs     \n\nI would be FUMING if my daughter died and within a year, her name is wiped out by adoption in an effort to lock me away from my daughters child", "I would rather be in my sister's place with both my parents alive honestly. But that's me. I know my sister doesn't see it that way and feels bad about it. I still can't see my maternal family as wrong though because ultimately, they are not part of my sister's family.", "How the heck are the grandparents in any way wrong here? Their son-in-law married a new woman a year after their daughter died. Then 3 years later he tried to force them to be grandparents to their new baby too. When grandparents didn't agree, they did everything they could to cut the grandparents out of their grandchildren life, and when that failed, they've guilt tripped and manipulated the grandchild to want to cut contact with the grandparents. Grandparents made the right choice, looking at how the sister, stepmother and father ALL play these guiltripping, manipulative mind games still, 16 years later.", "This all could have been avoided if the parents had explained it all to her as a small child. \"You and OP have different mommies. Those are her mommy's family. Those people over there are your mommy's family.\" Children in their early learning phases could be made to understand that.\n\nInstead, stepmom raised her daughter to believe she was entitled to OP's family, which set her up for rejection. The fact that they CONTINUE to encourage this delusion in stepsister is just doing her more and more damage.\n\nGrandparents aren't responsible for stepmom's heinous manipulations.", "I get you. But at least he did not put so much effort to prevent the contact after she aged 12. \nAnd I don't like the stepmom, I feel like she is the one who possibly influenced the dad to try push his daughter away from the maternal family. She seems like the controlling type. Cause why would she want Op to forget her mom in the name of \"she's gone, so you wouldn't know her anyway\"? Why does she want to be so rid of OP's maternal side so much? Most step-parents wouldn't mind if the step kid was away for a day or two.", "It's your parents' fault for raising her to expect attention from your grandparents, and setting her up for disappointment. The poor kid is gonna need so much therapy by the time she gets out of that house, but that's not your fault.", "I had a feeling you'd say this. I think you should go on the family vacation with your grandparents and show them this post. Let them read the replies as well. They sound like healthy people who actually know you. I think they will be able to point you in the right direction.", "I nvr thought abt it this way. Mostly bc my culture is very welcoming to everyone. But I do respect your opinion:\")\n\nEdit: How the heck did the dad get married in just 1 year. I forgot about that. It seems suspicious \ud83e\udd14", "The next time your sister cries or tries to guilt-trip you, you need to tell her she has two living parents. You don't. She can't possibly understand what that's like.\n\nAnd your stepmom's only adopted you as a tactic to deprive you of your birthright, to stroke her own ego. Her continued efforts to force herself onto you are only pushing you away.\n\nNot everything is about them. You have a right to your own identity, and part of that identity is as your mother's daughter.", "I get both you and your sister. This situation is just not ideal.", "After the age of 12, they began using the younger sister to control OP. They created abandonment issues in that kid to the point where she cries anytime OP has contact with her mother's family. I assume the reason dad didn't flat out stop OP from seeing mom's parents after the age of 12 is because they could have gone back to court and OP would have been able to testify. Imagine if OP spoke to a court appointment psychologist and told that person everything she's telling us here....."]}
