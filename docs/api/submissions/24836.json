My parents were pretty young when they had me 25/26 respectively and my dad was remarried a little over a year later. When I was 3 my younger sister was born and my parents and my maternal family ended up feuding over my maternal family not wanting to form a relationship with my sister and saying they would not be treating the two of us equally. My stepmom ended up adopting me in an effort to sever contact with my maternal side of the family. But my maternal grandparents went to court for grandparents visitation rights which they were granted. Until I was 12 I saw my grandparents one day a month, two days a month on my birthday month and at Christmas when my dad was obligated to let me see them around the Christmas period.\n\nI grew up very close to my maternal family and when I was 12 dad started letting me dictate how much contact I had with them. He didn't like it, I know, but he allowed it because he sensed that I would become resentful of being kept from them when I was so closely bonded with them.\n\nIt has never bothered me that they didn't want to form a relationship with my sister. I get why they would feel that way and I understand why to them, my stepmom and sister are not part of their family. For me there's no big deal in that. It does upset my sister. But I have always assured her I love her and she's not going to lose me. I explained to her that my mom died before I could get to know her and that it's nice being with the people who were very close to her. And that I can ask them questions I can't ask my dad. She didn't understand that because my stepmom adopted me. She believed for so long that it meant my mom was no longer my mom at all and I became her mom's daughter completely.\n\nMy maternal family all planned for this big family vacation in July. They expressed an interest in me going and approached my dad about it. My parents brought it up to me and stated that they did not want me to go, that when my sister heard about it she got very upset and wondered why they still didn't want her now that she's 13 and could go and not be a burden on them. They said they would let me go but they wanted it to be clear that I would be breaking my sister's heart. My stepmom also told me that she wanted me to consider the fact that she had adopted and loved me and accepted me as her daughter and that I still called her my stepmom after all these years and not knowing my mom. She suggested that my maternal family were the reason for that and that it would have been kinder for me to not have any form of attachment to my mom when I can never get to know her. That it would have been kinder to allow me to see her (stepmom) as my only mom.\n\nI chose to go on the vacation and I had a great time. My sister was upset and she even cried a few times afterward. She asked why I left her behind. Why I let her be left out all the time. My parents kept to their word as well and I can tell they are disappointed in me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692261302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15thdze/aita_for_going_on_a_trip_with_my_maternal_family/", "score": 281, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I never felt like they had more than me or left out even though neither family wanted to get to know me as both relationships ended badly. \n\nIt is your stepmom and dads responsibility to help your sister understand and help her to not feel left out of the situation. \n\nIt\u2019s super sad that they\u2019re trying to manipulate you into not seeing your moms family and sounds super toxic tbh. Sounds liked your step mom feels jealous that your mom is somehow still in your dads life and therefore is indulging your sisters insecurities to pressure you into doing what she wants. \n\nI\u2019d just go live my the maternal family if it carries on. \n\nHope this helps, good luck.", "NTA, this is emotional blackmail. I would even say that your family are being toxic and controlling. You need to hang in there and be yourself, feel and think for yourself.", "NTA- this situation is sad because it didn't have to be this way. Your dad and stepmom have mishandled this, and if you sister is crying, that is your parent's fault, not yours. You've been pretty mature about the whole thing, while they have been fostering unreal expectations in your sister. I hope your sister gets some counseling.\n\nedit- corrected a misspelling", "NTA AT ALL. You have every right in this world to know about your real mom, the woman who gave you life. She died for goodness sake! She didn't just choose to up and leave. Your step mom is extremely cruel to want to take that from you. And shame on your dad allowing it. \n\nYour sister will be fine. Your parents are using and abusing her not explaining the real situation to her. Honestly.. When you're 18 I think you need to go LC and go to court to put your real mom back on your birth certificate.", "NTA - there is so much manipulation here on the adults part, I don't even know where to start. Did your grandparents ever admit to not wanting your sister or is this a story you were fed by your father and stepmom?\n\nTo me, it sounds as though your father moved on rather quickly, and wanted nothing to do with his late wife's family, which is incredibly cruel.  Your dad took you away from your grandparents and couldn't care less these people loved and had bonded with you. Nope, none of that mattered. All that mattered was his new family.\n\nRegardless, your mom will always be your mom. Clearly your stepmother has an issue with this and she is out of her mind. The fact both her and your father went to such lengths to create abandonment issues in your younger sibling, all in the name of control, is beyond disgusting.\n\nPlease understand, their narcissistic behaviour will not stop at your grandparents. It will carry on throughout your life and eventually, you will see it for what it is, but it's going to take you time. From the post, it sounds as though your grandparents love you very much, in a healthy way. Personally, I think you should consider moving in with them at some point. \n\nIf you take anything from my answer, please try and remember that anyone who uses manipulation tactics to motivate certain behaviour in you is not a person you want to be around. This can be a friend, an intimate partner, a sibling and even a parent. Usually when you don't give manipulating people the outcome they expect, you are in for a world of hurt. Good luck to you.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA it sounds like your dad and step mum are feeding your younger sister a narrative to try control you which is only harming her.

It's always the adults' fault, never the children.  If your dad and stepmom hadn't tried to erase your mother and embraced her as a 3rd parent who was simply no longer there, then they wouldn't have so much push back from you.\n\nAlso, your sister has two sets of grandparents, as do you.  Again, it's your parents' fault for setting up your sister for disappointment.  Your parents are trying to emotionally blackmail you by reminding you that it will \"Break your sister's heart\".\n\nYou shouldn't be made to feel guilty by simply wanting to know your mother and her family.", "NTA For 16 and having grown up in that environment you are handling this very maturely. Here are some things to think about why they are/arent or why they should/shouldnt be a certain way:\n\nWhy is your stepmom still being called \"stepmom\" after 15 years? is there any difference in how your sister and you are being treated, or is it just you doing it \"out of principle\"? How hurtful/\"unfair\" is it to your stepmom to be still called that? (for example why is your sister not \"stepsister\"?)\n\nWhy are your grandparents so adamant about not wanting ANYTHING to do with your sister? She isnt \"their granddaughter\", fair, but what if you think about her as a \"very good school friend\", that you happen to live with and spend most of your day/night with. She might not get presents, but why not just let her attend parties as part of \"your group\"? Its your parents they have a problem with, your sister did nothing wrong.\n\nWhy are both your parents putting the blame on you when your sister feels left out of something you do? Why is going with your grandparents different to, i dont know, going on a school trip, she also cant be part of that, right? If you ever get interested in doing a sport, is she gonna feel left out if she doesnt also get to do the same sport, in the same group with the same trainers/people? And why is it YOUR responsibility to address those insecurities of hers?\n\n\n\n\n\nps: if some of the questions indirectly impy one side is clearly in the wrong (like you still calling her stepmom), make it a thought experiment to rephrase it so its the other way around, and see which side of the argument makes more sense.", "NTA for going on this trip (or any other trips) but ALL the adults around should have handled this better. It does sounds like your grandparents never really moved on from your mother dying and therefore couldn't accept that your dad met someone new, remarried and went and had another child. Their lack of acceptance probably resulted in your stepmother adopting you and your parents trying to get away from your maternal family. Which only escaleted things since your grandparents took things to court to get visitations right. Stuck in the middle was you who longed for learning more about a mother you never knew and didn't remember and your little sister not understanding why these people fought so hard for you but didn't want anything to do with her. This all could have been avoided with more communications and more acceptance. Of course you have the right to spend alone time with your maternal grandparents. If they had only accepted your new family and included them in some family gatherings everything could have been so different.\n\nAlso, your stepmom's parents and extended family? Do they treat you and your sister equally and consider you family? If so, this very much explains your sister's reactions. Because than you have MORE people who loves you than she does and to her you are her full sister, nothing else.\n\nA very interested point was also made by your stepmom, how come you don't call her mom? She has been your only mother since you were only a year old and begun forming your language, it would have been natural for you to begin calling her mom (heck, my own child called her best friend's parents mom and dad when she was two since those were the \"names\" her friend used, it's very natural for a child to do so). Someone must have influated you to not do it, maybe even correct you when you DID call her mom (which is very likely you did do as a young child). Something happened there when you were young. Could that have been the reason your parents wanted to sever all contact with your maternal family? Because they objected when you begun to talk and accepted stepmom as your mother?\n\nStill, YOU are of course not the a-hole, but it's very likely the adults in your life are.", "The assholes are your maternal grandparents and your current parents. Not you or your sister.\n\nYour current parents for not allowing you to have proper contact with your mother's side of the family (especially as your mother died when you were so young)\n\nAnd your maternal grandparents because, yes your sister and stepmum aren't related to them, but your sister is still a child and would naturally feel left out her big sister has an extra family she doesn't really understand about (although at 13 she now probably can) and they could have least have been civil to her or met her a few times. \n\nAll four adults between them have caused this mess and led your sister to feel this way rather than being mature and explaining the situation to her and not having a legal mess about your contact with your grandparents, who in turn have ignored her entirely which is never nice, not you. NTA.", "You maternal extended family are T-A. To lose a daughter, then be so obstinate as to refuse to form a relationship with your sister\n\nYour step mom also is T-A. Adoption for the purpose of severing contact with your maternal family is a perverse motivation. To expect that she would become your mother completely and to the exclusion of your birth mother is ridiculous frankly. \n\nYou and your sister are NTA you got dealt a shit hand with your mum dying while you were young and then having the adults and extended family that collectively can\u2019t pull their head out of their ass and behave like decent humans. \n\nIt\u2019s natural for you to want to have a relationship with with your maternal family. \n\nIt\u2019s also natural for your sister to be hurt by their complete refusal to have anything to do with her. Like you can have a relationship with someone who is not a direct blood relative..?\n\nI don\u2019t have advice but the way the \u201cgrown ups\u201d are behaving is toxic.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I personally like the \"school friend\" scenario, so everyone has a picture in their head how they are meant to interact with each other  (2nd grandchild-grandparents vs schoolfriend-grandparents), instead of trying to force either side to choose either-or.\n\nAs for the mom/stepmom thing, if its really just a way to differentiate, how unreasonable is to just say \"fuck it\" and start calling her mom? of couse decide that for yourself, and have the same talk you try to have with your stepmom with your grandparents, about it being \"just a word, it doesnt hold any meaning\". For example, Im thinking how i called a friend \"Robbie\" during childhood, separated after school, and when we now met years later at 25 they asked me to call them \"Rob\" instead, bc they would feel awkward with Robbie, even though thats what i called them for 8+ years.\n\nAll in all, your parents are adults ffs, and your sister will still be a child for a couple years.

It seems like OP is reassuring sister of her love but the parents are undermining that. OP, I think your parents are a lost cause , but do have a serious sit down with your sister, she\u2019s 13 , she can understand,reverse the roles if needed, say that if (god forbid) her mother had died , and dad remarried, would she want to never remember she had a mother, that her dad wouldn\u2019t want her to mention her bio mom in front of him or his new family,and if she had a new sister, would she pressure her own grandparents to include her.

You have had interference from both sides of the family that skewed the immediate family dynamics. Your stepmother adopted you at 2 years old, and in a normal family, you would be calling her mom, but likely the maternal side of the family has robbed you of a potential close relationship with her. Were they expecting him to remain single for the rest of his life? That is something you need to look closely into when you get older. I wouldn't doubt at all that the maternal side kept stating she wasn't your mother, which damaged the family dynamics, and explains why you don't call her mom.  I can totally see why your stepmother is feeling hurt. In regards to your half-sister, she needs to realize she is part of a blended family. Also, blended families usually allow for half siblings to attend some events (not extended holidays), which again shows the skewed family dynamics. Again, the maternal side can't seriously have expected him to not remarry, and if your parents were trying to stop the relationship, it was because of the interference. All the adults at that time should have handled it differently and maybe had a family therapist involved so that all relationships were strong and supportive to the growth of a child.", "You are at the age where you are about to have a lot of relationships and experiences that your sister will not get to participate in.

I'm assuming you will choose to move out of a home where you are being emotionally manipulated and head to a college campus. \n\nYour sister will grow up in a few years, too. She'll get some perspective with maturity. \n\nKeep your relationship with your maternal grandparents. See them as often as you want. Take the vacations, enjoy the time and connect with your roots. \n\nTell your sister you love her. Spend quality time with her while you're still living at home.

If you feel close to your bio mom when spending time with her family, you should do that. I think it\u2019s great that you have the opportunity to have so many family options.

Taking her on adventures and including her in your life. It seems as you already do that. \nThat way your bond will be strong as you build your own families.", "NTA. If your Dad & stepmother had done their jobs right, your sister would understand & this whole situation would have been avoided.", "NTA", "NTA, and your parents are wrong for making you feel guilty. Clearly your mom's family means a lot to you since you lost her so young. Your dad remarried really fast,  so there was probably some hurt and resentment there even before the courts got involved. I'm assuming your half sister has 2 sets of grandparents. I'm not sure why it upsets her so much that you see yours from your mom.", "Nta your dad and his wife probably egged on your half sister. They could have handled it better.

That was your grandparent's choice, no one should feel forced to have a relationship if they don't want one.  They had lost a daughter, perhaps they felt your dad moved on too quickly, or they were worried they'd never get to see you again.\n\nOf course you want a relationship with your mom's parents and family!  Just because your stepmom is now your mom, doesn't mean you should never see your mom's side of the family.  Ask your dad how he would feel if he died and you were expected to never see his parents or anyone in his family ever again?", "So my thoughts are your moms parents did not want to form a relationship with your sister for a few reasons. 1st -they felt that your step mom was trying to take the place of your mother which by your stepmoms own words she was\n2nd -they may have wanted to create a safe place for you to learn about your mom without fear of your parents adding to or taking away from possibly by using your sister to tell them everything\n\n3rd-by only having you to focus on they can make sure that you are being seen, heard, taught, and spoiled like your mom would want.\n\nAnd lastly- your grandparents went through a massive battle with your parents to just be apart of your life after losing their child they almost lost their grand baby to the last piece of their daughter. The financial and emotional strain would make it hard to deal with your parents I\u2019m sure. Especially if they felt your parents were trying to erase your mom.\n\nI have multiple half siblings and adopted siblings. My mom never tried to take their moms places. She actually actively worked to preserve their relationships with their biomoms.

And when I visit my grandparents it\u2019s like I get to hold that piece and discover new things about it.\u201d \n\nTell your sister that her saying she needs to choose between your grandparents and her is the same as you telling her she has to choose between her and her mom. You would never ask her to do that because you would never want her to lose a parent.\n\nGood luck and I may suggest you ask your parents if they are trying to alienate you and make it so you don\u2019t want to interact with them when you are an adult?

That is something you can investigate further when you are older. In regards to your sister, she is part of a blended family, and most do allow step siblings to attend some events but not holidays. Your sister will never be included for anything as your maternal side is angry he remarried in the first place. Very sad all around as the family dynamics are skewed now.
