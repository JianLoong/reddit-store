Since I work 2 jobs, I decided to split my availability in two.  I work at my other job Monday-Wednesday and I work at the restaurant from Friday-Sunday.  My managers at the restaurant I work at were super accommodating when I told them I was getting another job.  They asked if I wanted to make any changes to my hour, so I requested to work mornings on Sundays.  They decided that I could take the 10am-3pm shift every Saturday and Sunday.  This worked out because I have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and the consistency helps me.  So for the past 2 months those have been my shifts.  \n\nLast night, when the schedule for next week was released, a coworker who I\u2019ll Anna (F20) messaged me and asked if I\u2019d be willing to switch my Saturday 10-3 shift for her 4pm-8pm.  She said it was because my shift would give her more hours and she also forgot to book it off and has an important dinner that night.  I responded that I\u2019d prefer to keep my shift and apologized to her.  Anna and I aren\u2019t friends and didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling her that it was mostly because of my anxiety.\n\nAnna apparently didn\u2019t appreciate that answer.  She asked if I had plans or something and I said that I might but it doesn\u2019t change my answer.  She then told me she would go to one of the managers and get them to change the schedule, which they won\u2019t do since the schedule has already been released and they only change it if both people agree to trade or give away/take a shift.  I reminded her of that, but she just left the message on seen.\n\nI don\u2019t feel that I did anything wrong, but I also really don\u2019t want to cause drama and tension in the workplace.

When you want to swap shifts, you have to make it look appealing to the other person.\n\nTo say \"I want to swap shifts because your shift is longer and I want more hours\" is just laughable.

You have a condition she needs to know nothing about, and she threatened to involve management in the throw a tantrum style of a toddler.

If you're asking a question where the only answer you'll accept is a yes, then it's not a question, it's a demand. And threatening to go to the managers to try and get them to force you to do it once you'd already said no? Wow.. just wow.\n\nOP, someone is causing drama and tension, but it's definitely not you. Stick to your guns and let Anna throw her fit - if she pushes it further, it might be good to remind her that it's not YOUR fault that she forgot about her \"important dinner,\" it's hers, and if anyone should have to rearrange their plans thanks to this error, then it should be her. Best of luck! Anxiety sucks. :(", "NTA, at all. But Anna is probably going to be a problem, so loop your managers in if you need to!", "NTA. You did nothing wrong and there is no need to apologize. It\u2019s her problem for not planning ahead and she was way out of line to try to intimidate you over that.", "NTA and I\u2019d let your manager know.", "NTA\n\n\"Sorry, I can't\" is all you need to say. You don't need to justify any more than that.", "NTA. Your schedule, your decision. Good for sticking up for yourself.

A simple no from you should be enough to make her back off, she\u2019s not entitled to an explanation which is why you\u2019re not the asshole. But the drama has probably been started.

OP would still NTA saying no if asked.", "We really don't know enough about every other person who works there to make this call. Maybe Anna is one of those people who usually refuses to work anything but dinner shifts where it's busiest but just wants it this one time due to her own personal schedule.
