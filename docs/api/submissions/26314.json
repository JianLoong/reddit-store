I think that was a bit much to use to address the situation.

I had been used to having all of my grandparents around growing up when we had holidays and birthdays and just in general get together for dinner kind of things. No one ever said anything about my grandparents having to pay my dad to come see as kids because they moved further away or anything like that. So it's definitely not something that your parents would need to do to see their grandkids. If you decide to stay, that would be on your own merit. Your parents will need to learn to either travel by car or plane however it is that they need to get there stay for a week to see the kids and then go home. As far as grandparents rights, I don't know a lot about it but grandparents can't cannot gain custody of the kids unless there's extenuating circumstances in the situation.

I think I was 15 before he started taking every other weekend (9 when he left).", "It *used to be* that laws favoured women getting custody, absolutely. But today, that's no longer true in the US overall, and that's the claim I generally see. \n\nThe numbers don't bear out continued bias in the courts overall. It exists in some judisdictions, but the fact is that the majority of custody cases are decided by parents outside of court. Women end up with more custody most of the time. They also do most of the childcare while in relationships. Those things are probably linked. There are societal reasons that men get less custody, and I'm absolutely here to work on them, but it's important to be precise when we're talking about the problem. I think this is a function of trends in heterosexual relationships that men benefit from. It's a great example of why patriarchy hurts everyone and why the early men's rights movement were closely allied with feminists.\n\nIn some states, it may be the court is a meaningful factor. But most of the time it's not, and conflating the statistics of \"total custody time\" with \"custody awarded by the court\" is disingenuous at best and very common.\n\nhttps://www.weinmanfamilylaw.com/blog/2020/06/are-the-courts-gender-biased-in-custody-cases/\n\nThere's a chicago tribune article that's further linked, but it's behind a paywall. I'm like 90 min past bedtime now and work in the morning, so I'm not digging up further sources right now, but you are welcome to do the research you mentioned needing to do.", "Yeah, that\u2019s how my niece was. She had multiple people that would have taken her in. For years, she was doing most of the parenting bc she was 6 years older than my nephew. Your brothers are lucky to have you. The system is really effed. I hope things are going well for all of you now.", "It's okay to call out sexism and racism against minorities because they experience systemic sexism and racism. Someone saying something without nuance is not an attack on you personally. They aren't perpetuating discrimination by lamenting the fact that a large number of men are depraved without making sure to not include the ones who aren't shitty. But similar statements about minorities **do** perpetuate discrimination.\n\nIf you aren't one of the shitty people they were talking about, recognize that not everything is about you and move on."]}
