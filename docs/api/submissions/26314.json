But, you are wrong in asking them to come up with the difference in your salary from the job that you would be giving up just so they could see their grandkids. I think that was a bit much to use to address the situation. They should know that when people have children and a new job comes along and it's going to benefit their family and they have to move that's just part of life. When I was a little girl, my grandparents moved with their daughter who was my father's sister and her family and husband about 1500 miles away. I had been used to having all of my grandparents around growing up when we had holidays and birthdays and just in general get together for dinner kind of things. No one ever said anything about my grandparents having to pay my dad to come see as kids because they moved further away or anything like that. So it's definitely not something that your parents would need to do to see their grandkids. If you decide to stay, that would be on your own merit. Your parents will need to learn to either travel by car or plane however it is that they need to get there stay for a week to see the kids and then go home. As far as grandparents rights, I don't know a lot about it but grandparents can't cannot gain custody of the kids unless there's extenuating circumstances in the situation. I do know in some states are a grandparents rights where the grandparents can go to court and ask for visitation of their grandkids just so they do have the chance to see them.", "this question is an asshole\n\nwhat a moronic and contrived way to word something that is simply a fair argument with reasons from both side that need to be measured", "ESH.

No amount of JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) from you will change their emotional response.
