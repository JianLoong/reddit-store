And if they care that much, why don't they move to your new town?", "NTA\n\ncongratulations on your new job, I hope it does fabulous things for you and your family", "Nta, I get that you're not actually asking them for money but making them realize you cannot give up this job opportunity just so they can live close.\n\nEta also the fact they threatened the grandparents rights crap makes them a huge ah. If they're willing to threaten to take children away from their parents simply because they don't get their way, then they shouldn't have access to those kids.", "NTA\n\nIt's not the 1950's anymore and we don't have grandparents/parents/kids all living in the same household or even the same town anymore.  With the modern economy, the \"nuclear family\" is now the norm and not the exception.\n\nYou have a fantastic opportunity for a new job with much better pay.  The only people that can make the decision on whether or not to pursue that opportunity are you and your spouse.  If you decide that taking the job is the best thing to do... you do it.\n\nSimply tell your parents this is too good an opportunity to pass up.  You understand that they are down because they won't be able to see the grandkids as often, but your door is always open for them when they want to visit.  However, you need to take advantage of this opportunity so you can provide for your family in the best way possible.\n\nIf they can't understand that, they are just being selfish expecting you to tailor your lives around them instead of doing what's best for you and your children.", "NTA. Your title had me thinking otherwise, though. People MOVE. Jobs CHANGE. It isn't a personal slight against your parents. Although, with the way they are acting, I'd move even if I didn't have a better job because once you threaten me with legal action (grandparents rights), whether baseless or not, that's when you lose me and my kids.", "Here's how your parents are planning your life:\n1. Turn down job improvement and stay near them\n2. They will live their normal life while you are making an insufficient salary\n3. Parents will die\n4. You never have the ability to bring your missed opportunities current. You will never recoup the lost wages nor have the ability to improve your standard of living going forward because you will be too old. \nSee how that works?", "NTA\n\nJust do what is best for your own family and let your parents decide whether or not to come see your kids.", "NAH\n\nYou need to do whatever is in the best interest of your family. Your comment about them paying you is just to show your reasoning. \n\nYour parents are understandably upset because they won\u2019t be seeing their grandkids as often. They\u2019re sad & upset so they\u2019re saying crazy things. Seems pretty normal. \n\nEdit", "NTA\n\nSometimes, asshole people need it beat up our their head to understand.

Your parents have had it is easy to see their grandchildren being only 8 blocks away.  Life changes occur, that is just a fact of the matter.  If they want to prioritize seeing their grandchildren, great, let them move near where your new job will be, otherwise zip it already.", "NTA but geez you could be a little less blunt and a little more empathetic towards your parents who are obviously having a hard time dealing with the fact that their grandkids are going to be moving far away.", "Yeah NTA but stupid to bring up them laying to see them. Ultimately its about priorities.\n\n\nIf the new job improves your quality of life they should accept that.", "ESH.\n\nYour parents are being the bigger AH.\n\nBut your suggestion was not honest and only to stoke a fire. There is no way you were expecting your parents to meet that demand when you offered it up as an \u201coption\u201d.

You have every right to move for a better job. You need to do what's best for your family. \n\nI don't know where you're located, but grandparents rights sound like a horse shit card to pull. \n\nIf you hadn't chosen to go with with \"paying you\" tactic, your parents would be entirely the assholes. But because you did, YTA too. \n\nApologise for being an asshole. But they need to be understanding. Perhaps they can follow if they want to continue being active in their grandchildren's lives. But they shouldn't be trying to hold you back.", "YTA.  What you\u2019re proposing is veiled extortion and someone really needs to bring you back into reality.", "YTA. it is your family.  what you suggest just seem like a way to prolong fight and start up weird argument.  i think YTA for how weird you are being with the whole thing.  tell them they can come visit.  that is it.  they will just have to deal with it.", "You ALL are the Asshole......
