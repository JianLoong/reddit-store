Those words will ring in his head forever and might reinforce his fear of other people doing just that.", "NTA, but you should approach it cautiously. Sit with him one on one, make sure he is comfortable, and make sure he knows he is not in trouble. Its not as easy as saying \"Please ask before you use my stuff\" like you would with your sister. He may be very embarrassed an insecure. \n\nStart with letting him know you love him and accept him, then let him know what you say and show your support, let him know that he can borrow things if he asks, and that you would be willing to go shopping with him.\n\nWhatever you do do not be pushy, even if you are being supportive. He may not want to shop with you, dont push the offer, he may not want to talk about it, don't try to make him. He may deny it and get defensive, accept that, maybe say you might have been mistaken. \n\nRegardless of how he acts make sure you express the point that you are accepting, understanding and loving. If he is not ready to be open about it, he will hopefully know when he is he has you.", "Nah NTA. Try to make sure he knows you aren't judging or attacking him when you approach the convo though. Maybe buy/offer to help shop for cheaper drugstore makeup for himself to practice with if your stuff is expensive.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think there would be anything wrong with you drawing a boundary regarding your clothes and makeup. \n\nI think, in this situation, I would just make it really clear that I love him and fully support him wearing makeup and my clothes, but that makeup is expensive so I would prefer to recommend makeup for him or I could buy some in and make him a little corner (if he feels he needs to hide his makeup with mine).", "go gentle gentle. Dont make a big deal over the borrowing without asking first.  \n\n\nLet him be comfortable with you - maybe start with a few \"blue eyeshadow and dat shirt would be amazing\" comments, comments that normalise this stuff for him. take him to a drag show! Watch some shows on TV that normalise this stuff and normalise acceptance. Let him know gently your point of you, your support. That you are an ally. Engage in Pride activities.  \n\n\nWhen he is ready to tell you, absolutely take him shopping. Once he has been shopping.. invite the sisters together (if all comfy and accepting) have a girlie night and lightheartedly lay down the sister rulzzz - no borrowing clothes without asking, always having each others backs with partners, always been honest when asked \"does my butt look big in this\"  \n\n\nSuper sensitive time all round!!

Maybe bought him some cosmetic that not expensive as gifts.", "NTA. But I'd take him out of the house somewhere private and bring up the topic gently. Let him know you're entirely comfortable with what he's doing, you just don't want him to feel like he's got to sneak around in your room. \nAlso, I get the whole permission to borrow things, but maybe set some ground rules of a few things he can experiment with so he doesn't feel like he's got to ask you every time if he's still feeling like he wants to try things in private. \nI'd also suggest you let him keep some things of his own in your room. If he buys his own makeup or clothing he simply may not feel comfortable storing it in his room, so allowing him a spot in your closet to keep a few things may allow him to explore with his own things, without feeling like someone might find them in his room.", "NTA just be gentle because if he's hiding it means he's scared. Maybe ask if he'll go makeup shopping with you and help you pick some colors or something. On a side note YOU ROCK. It's amazing to see somebody not care about their loved ones sexuality. So thank you from the bottom of my biheart", "NTA. However, I wouldn\u2019t tell him you saw him.

Just be loving and supporting of him in every aspect you can of his daily life.", "NTA, ask him if he wants to go shopping. Make a good bonding trip out of it.", "NTA- like you said makeup is expensive, and he\u2019s confided you before.

Boundaries are set for a reason.\r It seems like you are a very caring person and have a healthy relationship with your brother. It seems he may be curious. You could have a heart to heart with him and support him.", "NTA at all. I think it will be nice that he can share this with someone, and you as his sister being supportive and helping him would probably mean the world to him.", "NTA, I personally would prefer it (I assume, I can't really put myself in his shoes) if the person who broached the subject to me basically said \"ya idgaf honestly, but makeup aint cheap\" I'd find the icebreaker/'diversion' you could say to be really refreshing and relieving. I think it'd be fine if you did it in a non confrontational way, like in an understanding manner. Which it sounds like you're all about. Maybe just do it when you're both alone so no one can barge in just in case?", "NTA and just be calm & matter of fact & fairly brief. \n\n\u201cOh btw I don\u2019t mind sharing stuff in general but my make up is really expensive and it\u2019s a really bad idea for hygiene reasons to share eye make up, so I\u2019ve put the stuff I don\u2019t mind you borrowing in (this place)\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s not able to buy his own supplies at this stage (because of money or eg small town embarrassment) then it would be kind to buy him a small selection before this conversation - or if you think he\u2019d prefer to have input on colours etc then make him the offer when you talk to him.", "NTA, tho i'd say to avoid confrontation. Instead, when the time is right, start by saying that you love him and only then mention that you noticed him going through your stuff. And QUICKLY (before he gets a chance to react) add that its fine, and you're happy for him (maybe hug him if thata what you do). Talk about it a little while. \n\nAnd only AFTER all of that, ask him to ask you before borrowing something. Also if you feel like it, then you might want to add that you'd be happy to buy something for him (in a way that you'd go to store instead of him, not that you'd pay for it). \n\nIts 101 of resolving conflicts. Avoid being accusatory at all cost. If you have doubts wether or not it might sound accusatory - always assume that it does. Especially since you dont have anything to accuse him of. Because, as i'm sure you know, he didnt asked you not because he didnt wanted to, but probably because he was ashamed of it, thought you wouldnt agree, that you could laugh it out etc. If you settle that, and show that you support him, then i'm pretty sure he wont have issues with asking you for permission. And in case he still would - propose to buy some stuff for him. Ask him what of yours cosmetics/clothes he like, and offer to buy them his own, then he wont have to ask you every time.\n\nOh, and just something i thought might be important: give him privacy. If he asks you for idk, an eyeliner and you agree, then dont expect that he has to show you how he looks. If you want, then offer help, but dont insist. And when he'll feel comfortable enough, then he should came to you himself.", "I think it might be best to just try talking to him. \"Suggesting\" he might look good with eyeliner perhaps... Go from there.\n\nNTA whatever you decide. If you do end up embarrassing him then that's on him.", "NTA. I\u2019d buy him his own (if I had the funds), or do a session with him. Say \u2018I\u2019m trying a new look will you help or can I do yours? We can hang out,  music and snacks and try out these looks I\u2019ve found on Instagram\u2019 (for eg). \n\nThen later say, if you want to borrow anything let me know", "Tbh I don\u2019t think I\u2019d only address the fact that your brother was taking/using your things without permission. It doesn\u2019t matter what it was, you should always ask. \nI wouldn\u2019t make a big deal of it, probably just say something like \u2018If you need to use some make up, can you ask first please? It\u2019s getting expensive\u2019. Then give him a wink and a hug and carry on with your day. \nHe then knows that it\u2019s not what he\u2019s wearing that is the issue, it\u2019s the taking without asking. If he\u2019s confided in you before, when he\u2019s ready he will confide in you again", "NTA. Just be matter of fact and say if you want to explore that\u2019s fine. Just ask first.

Maybe get him a dress too. I mean, it's not horrible, and he has a sister to be his cover while he figures it out. Plus, this prolly wasn't the first time, and he could prolly use lessons on makeup. It could be a wonderful bonding time. No matter what he decides", "NTA  \n\n\nYou ask WIBTA? depends but based on your post it seems like his mental health is critical to you.

I don't think confrontation is right, though you should talk to him.\n\nGently mention you saw him and request that he ask next time. \n\nFurther, offer to go shopping with him for his own makeup (it's unsanitary to share) and a few cute key pieces of clothing.", "Daddy he disown me cos I wear my sister's clothes/caught me in the bathroom with a pair of pantyhose!\n\nSorry. I had to.", "Your intentions are clearly well-meaning and you're willing to help your brother explore his identity, it's very reasonable you just want him to ask before borrowing your belongings \u2014 it would be the same if you had a sister who used your makeup without asking.

No.", "It may be embarrassing for him but if he\u2019s already confided in you about his sexuality I don\u2019t think it would be as big a deal as your parents or someone that doesn\u2019t know finding out.

One thing I would like to know tho. How old is he?", "No I don\u2019t think so providing you did it in such a way where you didn\u2019t shame him or make him feel strange for experimenting. \n\nPerhaps buy him some make up or offer to take him to pick out his own within a price range agreed before hand and ask him to use that instead as your other stuff is expensive and while you don\u2019t consider his experimenting a \u2018waste\u2019 you would like to keep that expensive makeup to yourself. \n\nBy buying or offering to buy him his own you are letting him know it\u2019s totally ok, because it is.

Would going \"hey bro I need your help out shopping for make up for you as I think there's this nice stuff I think work has for you\" and not making a fuss would work best or will a calm conversation with him leading with how much you love him and want to support him would be best. \n\nAs long as you go about it leading with how will make him comfortable and in a way that will make him comfortable, go with that.", "You need mental help if you believe it\u2019s not normal.", "Like... you're a pothead... didn't Marijuana also need to be \"normalized\" as acceptable because it wasn't \"normal\" either and was actively shunned by society and users were submitted to 'facilities' where they could get professional help to not partake? \n\nPlease tell me you see the irony in your statement here...\n\n*before you clap back, I'm also a stoner and avid smoker, but I'm also aware of ever evolving societal norms on things that don't harm others or myself... such as simply trying on makeup in a mirror because I care about how to enhance my look...\n\nI'm also queer AF, but let's be real here... don't hate on someone just doing some innocent self discovery meow", "That's a good idea! My daughter is pretty timid and I find if I take her to the store to pick things out she freezes up and can't make a decision. Online shopping is a great way to explore products without feeling like people are watching you pick things out", "Online shopping is good, but you can also work the magic of shopping together in person by playing up the \"I'm dragging you along\" trope. Be vocal about \"your\" indecisions on articles of clothing that they indicate towards. \"Oh my god, feel this fabric!\" \"Do you think this top will be flattering?\" \"This is cute but I don't know about the cut of the bust, hmm, I don't know if the discomfort is worth it?\"  \nOnline it is hard to judge quality and potential fit. Even if you don't buy in store it can help them make choices online later.", "Yeah exactly, you totally get it. Honestly the 'confront' in your post title is a bit mis-leading because it sounds like you want to do this 100% the correct way already!", "We are living in modern times, we can get dildo deliver whithout anyone knowing it, if he wants to try that he can order himself some makeup, not use someone else's, it's unhygienic for both of them.", "I totally understand, that is very beautiful of you! In either case, they\u2019re lucky to have you as a sister :)", "Hey not trying to criticize here just wanted to provide a second perspective as a trans man. In my opinion you shouldn't be using new pronouns until you hear it from him. I know that you and the person that brought it up have good intentions but it's not the best way to support him. \n\nYour brother could be trans, he could be gender nonconforming, he could like to cross dress, but he could also just be figuring himself out. Don't put pressure on him and make him feel like he has to make a choice right now. \"They\" may feel like a neutral option while he's figuring out and he might chose to use it, but personally I really didn't like people using it for me without my permission (with an exception for people I'm meeting that don't know my gender of course). \n\nIf he tells you he wants to try new pronouns out down the line you can help with that! It's hard to tell how pronouns feel until someone uses them to you. \n\nFor now I think the rest of the advice in the thread is good- let him know in a gentle way that you want him to ask before he borrows your things and that you'd love to help him learn and buy things of his own. Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions. My transition went the opposite direction but I've got some general insight!", "Cool, yeah, take him shopping. Your parents don't need to know he is an adult. I bet he would like spending time and shopping maybe out of town if he is worried about running into someone he knows. Like a large mall or shopping center 1 or 2 hours away where chances are slim that people know him. If someone does you dragged him along to carry the bags. Get him makeup and an out fit or 2 to keep in your room.", "I had this friend in HS that used to always go after my eye makeup and my MASCARA and I was like wtf is wrong with youuu\n\nConjunctivitis is noooo joke and especially no fun\n\nPs OP is absolutely NTA, sounds like a good sister to me!", "I've never gotten either, but my mom got pink eye when she was grieving because of the transfer of tears/mucus/mouth bacteria combo. It was terrifying and downright torture to see her suffer. Me and my -one- good eye, my left eye vision is so poor I'm terrified of what will happen if I ever loose sight in my right eye", "Not just pink eye! There\u2019s herpes and staph as well", "Bloody hell it's terribly painful, my kid got pink eye in kindergarten, before we knew it he infected us all, we never had it before, not even my mom, who also got it from him\ud83d\ude33", "Nasty eye infections of varying degrees. We all have a different balance of bacteria and introducing someone else's bacteria to a sensitive place like the eye can cause horrible consequences.\n\nProfessional makeup artists use disposable applicators for just that reason, I am unsure how they handle the brushes but I know they have a decontamination process for those too.", "THIS is the reason I don't like make-up stylists doing my makeup especially with their brushes!!", "I can answer this... But it will make you question all advertising of shoes, tights and socks from now on...\n\nIt is built into us to want features of men we find attractive. Also means when it comes to legs, we want the natural leg formation that men have. It's why drag queens love and show off their legs so much because they are able to manage the look women try to replicate so easily. \n\nAlso it's why they often use male models for tights and leg shots for certain things. Same as how they use white paint like substances for cream or milk in commercials - it gives the desired appearance easily even under all the hours and lights required for filming and shoots. \n\nBut ya we want to have long lashes because guys have long lashes. It's a thing. Makes advertising and product photography an interesting world.", "Haha wow. Ok.", "Oh sorry, i just ment it in like a conversational way, nothing accusatory or anything. Maybe im just using the word wrong.", "Thank you for the insight! Its a new topic for me so im still learning myself and how to be supportive in the best way i can be. Ill stick to he/him from now on till he says otherwise. Cant thank you all enough for being patient with me and giving me advice <3", "Well, I can and still share with my mother. My friend shared with her sisters. That's why it was very painful learning experience \ud83e\udd23", "If you realise your eye is getting itchy, go straight to the doctor and insist on \"big guns\"\nBut the best way for me is never to share a towel or eye makeup. Once when I went to have my makeup professionally done, I brought my own brushes and mascara and everything else.

I didn't know this, so this is fascinating!", "I think it's maybe just because we don't mess with them every day? I've had a couple people ask if they could put mascara on me, just to see, which I've always politely declined. I get enough grease on my face in the shop, thanks!", "My boyfriends lashes are gorgeous and I\u2019m jealous because they\u2019re so much better than mine \ud83d\ude02", "No problem! I love answering questions from people that are trying to learn. \n\nIt's a learning process. I'm still learning new things about being trans and it's my life!", "Nah, even the women who don\u2019t wear makeup except for special occasions never seem to have lashes as long/thick as men. I assume its the hormone difference, sort of like how men have thicker hair for their facial hair.", "Makes sense... My mail order doctorate hasn't arrived yet, so I'm in no position to argue.
