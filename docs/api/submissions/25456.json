Sit with him one on one, make sure he is comfortable, and make sure he knows he is not in trouble. Its not as easy as saying \"Please ask before you use my stuff\" like you would with your sister. He may be very embarrassed an insecure. \n\nStart with letting him know you love him and accept him, then let him know what you say and show your support, let him know that he can borrow things if he asks, and that you would be willing to go shopping with him.\n\nWhatever you do do not be pushy, even if you are being supportive. He may not want to shop with you, dont push the offer, he may not want to talk about it, don't try to make him. He may deny it and get defensive, accept that, maybe say you might have been mistaken. \n\nRegardless of how he acts make sure you express the point that you are accepting, understanding and loving. If he is not ready to be open about it, he will hopefully know when he is he has you.", "Nah NTA. Try to make sure he knows you aren't judging or attacking him when you approach the convo though. Maybe buy/offer to help shop for cheaper drugstore makeup for himself to practice with if your stuff is expensive.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think there would be anything wrong with you drawing a boundary regarding your clothes and makeup. \n\nI think, in this situation, I would just make it really clear that I love him and fully support him wearing makeup and my clothes, but that makeup is expensive so I would prefer to recommend makeup for him or I could buy some in and make him a little corner (if he feels he needs to hide his makeup with mine).", "go gentle gentle. Dont make a big deal over the borrowing without asking first.  \n\n\nLet him be comfortable with you - maybe start with a few \"blue eyeshadow and dat shirt would be amazing\" comments, comments that normalise this stuff for him. take him to a drag show! Watch some shows on TV that normalise this stuff and normalise acceptance. Let him know gently your point of you, your support. That you are an ally. Engage in Pride activities.  \n\n\nWhen he is ready to tell you, absolutely take him shopping. Once he has been shopping.. invite the sisters together (if all comfy and accepting) have a girlie night and lightheartedly lay down the sister rulzzz - no borrowing clothes without asking, always having each others backs with partners, always been honest when asked \"does my butt look big in this\"  \n\n\nSuper sensitive time all round!!

Maybe bought him some cosmetic that not expensive as gifts.", "NTA. But I'd take him out of the house somewhere private and bring up the topic gently. Let him know you're entirely comfortable with what he's doing, you just don't want him to feel like he's got to sneak around in your room. \nAlso, I get the whole permission to borrow things, but maybe set some ground rules of a few things he can experiment with so he doesn't feel like he's got to ask you every time if he's still feeling like he wants to try things in private. \nI'd also suggest you let him keep some things of his own in your room. If he buys his own makeup or clothing he simply may not feel comfortable storing it in his room, so allowing him a spot in your closet to keep a few things may allow him to explore with his own things, without feeling like someone might find them in his room.", "NTA just be gentle because if he's hiding it means he's scared. Maybe ask if he'll go makeup shopping with you and help you pick some colors or something. On a side note YOU ROCK. It's amazing to see somebody not care about their loved ones sexuality. So thank you from the bottom of my biheart", "NTA. However, I wouldn\u2019t tell him you saw him.

Just be loving and supporting of him in every aspect you can of his daily life.", "NTA, ask him if he wants to go shopping. Make a good bonding trip out of it.", "NTA- like you said makeup is expensive, and he\u2019s confided you before.

Boundaries are set for a reason.\r It seems like you are a very caring person and have a healthy relationship with your brother. It seems he may be curious. You could have a heart to heart with him and support him.", "NTA at all. I think it will be nice that he can share this with someone, and you as his sister being supportive and helping him would probably mean the world to him.", "NTA, I personally would prefer it (I assume, I can't really put myself in his shoes) if the person who broached the subject to me basically said \"ya idgaf honestly, but makeup aint cheap\" I'd find the icebreaker/'diversion' you could say to be really refreshing and relieving. I think it'd be fine if you did it in a non confrontational way, like in an understanding manner. Which it sounds like you're all about. Maybe just do it when you're both alone so no one can barge in just in case?", "NTA and just be calm & matter of fact & fairly brief. \n\n\u201cOh btw I don\u2019t mind sharing stuff in general but my make up is really expensive and it\u2019s a really bad idea for hygiene reasons to share eye make up, so I\u2019ve put the stuff I don\u2019t mind you borrowing in (this place)\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s not able to buy his own supplies at this stage (because of money or eg small town embarrassment) then it would be kind to buy him a small selection before this conversation - or if you think he\u2019d prefer to have input on colours etc then make him the offer when you talk to him.", "NTA, tho i'd say to avoid confrontation. Instead, when the time is right, start by saying that you love him and only then mention that you noticed him going through your stuff. And QUICKLY (before he gets a chance to react) add that its fine, and you're happy for him (maybe hug him if thata what you do). Talk about it a little while. \n\nAnd only AFTER all of that, ask him to ask you before borrowing something. Also if you feel like it, then you might want to add that you'd be happy to buy something for him (in a way that you'd go to store instead of him, not that you'd pay for it). \n\nIts 101 of resolving conflicts. Avoid being accusatory at all cost. If you have doubts wether or not it might sound accusatory - always assume that it does. Especially since you dont have anything to accuse him of. Because, as i'm sure you know, he didnt asked you not because he didnt wanted to, but probably because he was ashamed of it, thought you wouldnt agree, that you could laugh it out etc. If you settle that, and show that you support him, then i'm pretty sure he wont have issues with asking you for permission. And in case he still would - propose to buy some stuff for him. Ask him what of yours cosmetics/clothes he like, and offer to buy them his own, then he wont have to ask you every time.\n\nOh, and just something i thought might be important: give him privacy. If he asks you for idk, an eyeliner and you agree, then dont expect that he has to show you how he looks. If you want, then offer help, but dont insist. And when he'll feel comfortable enough, then he should came to you himself.", "I think it might be best to just try talking to him. \"Suggesting\" he might look good with eyeliner perhaps... Go from there.\n\nNTA whatever you decide. If you do end up embarrassing him then that's on him.", "NTA. I\u2019d buy him his own (if I had the funds), or do a session with him. Say \u2018I\u2019m trying a new look will you help or can I do yours? We can hang out,  music and snacks and try out these looks I\u2019ve found on Instagram\u2019 (for eg). \n\nThen later say, if you want to borrow anything let me know", "Tbh I don\u2019t think I\u2019d only address the fact that your brother was taking/using your things without permission. It doesn\u2019t matter what it was, you should always ask. \nI wouldn\u2019t make a big deal of it, probably just say something like \u2018If you need to use some make up, can you ask first please? It\u2019s getting expensive\u2019. Then give him a wink and a hug and carry on with your day. \nHe then knows that it\u2019s not what he\u2019s wearing that is the issue, it\u2019s the taking without asking. If he\u2019s confided in you before, when he\u2019s ready he will confide in you again", "NTA. Just be matter of fact and say if you want to explore that\u2019s fine. Just ask first. And don\u2019t share makeup. That\u2019s a great way to get an infection. Get him his own makeup.", "NTA if you do it in private other wise you would be", "You know how you can get some serious sister points? Like those life long \u201cI trust you\u201d points?

Maybe get him a dress too. I mean, it's not horrible, and he has a sister to be his cover while he figures it out. Plus, this prolly wasn't the first time, and he could prolly use lessons on makeup. It could be a wonderful bonding time. No matter what he decides", "NTA  \n\n\nYou ask WIBTA? depends but based on your post it seems like his mental health is critical to you. So you have two points to make #1 a saw you... #2 thats my stuff come on bro...  \n\n\nso drop both quickly in private maybe a drive cause no where to run out of embarassment.  \nso be like hey bro so the other day i came home saw you were in my room and we need to talk about it... now stop there about the clothing and makeup wearing and focus on who's it is and it's cost explain you would love to get and store a privete kit for him in your room to cover for him and then tell him better outfits for his frame and guage him keep him enguaged and really honesly play up the money and style clash and play down the embarassing part offer a solution and be his haven i think you asking for advise is clearly a sign of your maturity about this situation and your borther will be fine likely better than fine if he trusts you and it sounds like he should", "Why don't you sit down on an afternoon and go through YouTube videos learning new makeup and hair techniques - much less confrontational and could be fun and allow you not to have to bring it up.

Calmly as you can . Good luck", "If all you want is for him to ask first, then NAH. In fact you sound like a wonderful sister and he's lucky to have you. But he should ask first.", "NTA, it's your things. Idc who or what you are if I don't like you touching my things im going to tell you. You mentioned the makeup is expensive, which it is. Growing up with a sister that would steal moms makeup all the time and hearing all the arguments that happened over it, he needs to learn not to go through your shit plain and simple.\n\nIts a respect issue and I would have felt the \"dis\" kind. \n\n\nIts 2023, unless you're hardcore right leaning family your brother absolutely has nothing to worry about especially if you are going to be a supportive sister. All my friends who came out said they worried too much before they came out. If I couldn't love them the way I did before finding out they were in the LGBTQ+ community, that absolutely makes me the asshole. But your brother definitely needs to learn to ask before going through other peoples things. Its better to learn this from a trusted individual than some random stranger that doesn't know who you are and who knows what could happen after that.", "NTA he should not go through your things in your back, and makeup should not be shared, it's rude of him to use yours", "NTA . I don't think confrontation is right, though you should talk to him.\n\nGently mention you saw him and request that he ask next time. \n\nFurther, offer to go shopping with him for his own makeup (it's unsanitary to share) and a few cute key pieces of clothing.", "Daddy he disown me cos I wear my sister's clothes/caught me in the bathroom with a pair of pantyhose!\n\nSorry. I had to.", "Your intentions are clearly well-meaning and you're willing to help your brother explore his identity, it's very reasonable you just want him to ask before borrowing your belongings \u2014 it would be the same if you had a sister who used your makeup without asking.

No.", "It may be embarrassing for him but if he\u2019s already confided in you about his sexuality I don\u2019t think it would be as big a deal as your parents or someone that doesn\u2019t know finding out.

One thing I would like to know tho. How old is he?", "No I don\u2019t think so providing you did it in such a way where you didn\u2019t shame him or make him feel strange for experimenting. \n\nPerhaps buy him some make up or offer to take him to pick out his own within a price range agreed before hand and ask him to use that instead as your other stuff is expensive and while you don\u2019t consider his experimenting a \u2018waste\u2019 you would like to keep that expensive makeup to yourself. \n\nBy buying or offering to buy him his own you are letting him know it\u2019s totally ok, because it is.

Because we're dicks like that lol. \n\nBut seriously, just say that make up is expensive so would you like me to teach you how to use it without destroying it or would you prefer to buy your own.

Im sure i do have a few basic products i can give him. Got plenty of nail polish to so i say go nuts on that one lol. \n\nMy main worry is not coming off as supportive, since it might seem like a repremand for using my stuff.

Her parents always thought she was gay, with the \"sly\" little comments of \"are you sure you are arent dressing for the wrong crowd if you want a boyfriend\". She would always just say a man who cant handle how a woman dresses isnt a man at all, just an insecure boy.", "Ok, i just want to do right by my brother. Im pretty inexperianced with pronouns when it comes to people who are experimenting or questioning. If theres anything i need to know please feel free to tell me. I jusy want him as comfortable as possible.", "thats how I feel! I love your mum! I get all the little side comments and told be smaller because my brother can not handle the ego bruisin of a sister better with power tools than he is..  \n\n\nI have not found that man yet! I have the bonus complications of been Neurodiverse! But I am actually pretty comfy with my \"tomboy boy filter\" and would rather be single than in a relationship where Im told Im wrong. Gotta enrich my life, treat my dogs well, or dont even bother.", "The biggest thing is to keep being supportive and open minded, which I have no doubt you will be fantastic at.  Sadly, the \"I know but don't officially know\" phase is difficult to navigate.  Ultimately it's a follow their lead on sticking with the status quo until otherwise directed.  I do really like the \"Hey, I saw this new make up thing and want to try it out on someone, are you open to that?\" idea.  Works best when no one else is around.  I don't know what type of people you both are but gothic makeup can be very artistic.  If the astehtic is not the norm for either of you, artistic creativity can be a good \"neutral\" point.\n\n\nAgain, I do understand the concept behind this person referring to your brother as they.  I also know some people don't like decisions make for them, especially during a time of crisis or unknown.  A part of respect is consent and currently no consent has been given to change pronouns.  Brother could also be happy you realized and changed in your own but if you are not 100% certain than you shouldn't change things for your brother. \n\n\n\n\nOn a completely unrelated side note, after I replied, due to insomnia I decided to take a peek at their comment history and they definitely gave some poor advice regarding snake care (no, no a snake will NOT always change its diet type of it gets hungry enough and you don't withold food for that long, ever.  Yes, everyone has got hot takes or poor advice or uneducated advice - myself included - but hot damn that's some clearly uneducated snake advice right there)", "the side eye I got for wearing \\*shock\\* PANTS to his wedding... it coulda been worse.. I wore green tartan pants, docs, a wastecoat and \"boyfriend\" cut blazer to my older more accepting bros wedding. THE HORROR on my little bros and wife faces at my frankly fabulous outfit was worth every cent.", "Honestly sounds dope as fuck. On the plus side with guys, sounds like you filter out the assholes pretty well lol. So when you do catch a guy bet he'll be amazing.", "Eh, in the meantime building a life I\u2019m happy with without it. Besides I\u2019m 35 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and live in a rural town. With a limited gene pool.", "As long as you are happy in life thats all that matters. And yeah i probably wouldnt date in a small town, sounds tiering and like to much drama based off what i know of small towns."]}
