Yeasterday I (20f) caught my brother in my room wearing some of my clothes and a full face of makeup with wipes at the ready it looked like. Luckly he didnt see me so i just went into the backyard for a bit as to not embaress him. \n\nNow to be clear, in no way do i think this is a sexual thing for my brother. Hes always been a feminine person and he has confided in me before that hes questioned hes sexuality and gender. \n\nWIBTA if i confronted and spoke to him about it? I really dont want to embaress him but if he does want to explore that side i would prefer he ask to borrow clothes and makeup, especially the makeup, that shit expensive lol. All the same I would ask of my sisters aswell, when they want to use my stuff. and maybe i can take him shopping to get his own clothes and makeup if he would prefer that. My main concern rn tho is that i want to make this whole thing less embaressing as possible for him because i know he will get in his head about it. So WIBTA?\n\nEdit: Ive taken some advice and kind of assembled a little pack. Im not sure ill give it to him right away or if ill let him tell me first but i want to have it on hand when if/when he tells me. Just some basics, like diffrent coloured nail polish even muted tones so he can work up to more bold colours when hes comfortable. I was able to doordash some makeup supplies that should be good for a beginner. Eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, lip gloss. Basiclly all the stuff it would be unhygenic to borrow. I also have some old clothes that would fit him great along with some actual new clothes that i ordered but a few were a bit to big on me. It was recently hes birthday so i went a bit overboard lol. Ive also cleared out a draw in my room where it can all go. Its just ready when hes ready for now.  \n\nAs for deciding if i will talk with him directly or wait for him to tell me, im still on the fence. If i do my rough plan would be to invite him to watch a show when everyones out, so theres background noise for him and hes more comfortable. Maybe paint my own nails and just gentely see if he would also like his done. If he goes for that maybe gently tell him (after the nails are dry, i dont want him to feel trapped) i saw him in my room and think he has good choice in fashion and that if he would like i have some clothes he can have that i think would suit him and some \"spare\" makeup since we really shouldnt share eyeliner or lipstick and stuff lol. Very rough draft to the plan but any suggestions on it?", "created_utc": 1692947890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160ryv1/wibta_if_i_confronted_my_brother_about_wearing_my/", "score": 3430, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those words will ring in his head forever and might reinforce his fear of other people doing just that.", "NTA, but you should approach it cautiously. Sit with him one on one, make sure he is comfortable, and make sure he knows he is not in trouble. Its not as easy as saying \"Please ask before you use my stuff\" like you would with your sister. He may be very embarrassed an insecure. \n\nStart with letting him know you love him and accept him, then let him know what you say and show your support, let him know that he can borrow things if he asks, and that you would be willing to go shopping with him.\n\nWhatever you do do not be pushy, even if you are being supportive. He may not want to shop with you, dont push the offer, he may not want to talk about it, don't try to make him. He may deny it and get defensive, accept that, maybe say you might have been mistaken. \n\nRegardless of how he acts make sure you express the point that you are accepting, understanding and loving. If he is not ready to be open about it, he will hopefully know when he is he has you.", "Nah NTA. Try to make sure he knows you aren't judging or attacking him when you approach the convo though. Maybe buy/offer to help shop for cheaper drugstore makeup for himself to practice with if your stuff is expensive.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think there would be anything wrong with you drawing a boundary regarding your clothes and makeup. \n\nI think, in this situation, I would just make it really clear that I love him and fully support him wearing makeup and my clothes, but that makeup is expensive so I would prefer to recommend makeup for him or I could buy some in and make him a little corner (if he feels he needs to hide his makeup with mine).", "go gentle gentle. Dont make a big deal over the borrowing without asking first.  \n\n\nLet him be comfortable with you - maybe start with a few \"blue eyeshadow and dat shirt would be amazing\" comments, comments that normalise this stuff for him. take him to a drag show! Watch some shows on TV that normalise this stuff and normalise acceptance. Let him know gently your point of you, your support. That you are an ally. Engage in Pride activities.  \n\n\nWhen he is ready to tell you, absolutely take him shopping. Once he has been shopping.. invite the sisters together (if all comfy and accepting) have a girlie night and lightheartedly lay down the sister rulzzz - no borrowing clothes without asking, always having each others backs with partners, always been honest when asked \"does my butt look big in this\"  \n\n\nSuper sensitive time all round!! How you handle this going to stick with him for a long time. Only you can judge how he will take any judgement or critisism at any point.", "YWNBTA. It sounds like you genuinely care for your brother's feelings and identity.", "NTA definitely, you're just concern about him and you just want to clarify things you know. Maybe it will make you guys closer when you do that", "NTA, \n\n>i would prefer he ask to borrow clothes and makeup, especially the makeup, that shit expensive lol\n\nIt is.", "Don't make a huge deal out of it but help him pick out some make up of his own maybe even offer to teach him the make-up basics if he's unsure on what he's doing (if that's something you're willing to sit down and commit to.)  \nFor hygiene reasons it's definitely better if you guys have your own sets offer to keep it with your make up if he's worried someone will find it.  \nYou could even offer to take him out shopping to pick out some clothes for himself on the pretense it's for someone else if that would make it easier for him or find a store that does free returns on online purchases and help him size up for clothes he enjoys.  \nHe's probably using your make up and clothes rather than your sisters because he feels safest with you and you definitely seem like an understanding sister, have a chat with him when no one else is around judgment free and without accusation and swear yourself to secrecy, let him work things out in his own time.  \nSorry that's probably worded awfully, sorry for the word vomit haha", "NTA make up is not something you will share with others people for hygiene reasons. Maybe bought him some cosmetic that not expensive as gifts.", "NTA. But I'd take him out of the house somewhere private and bring up the topic gently. Let him know you're entirely comfortable with what he's doing, you just don't want him to feel like he's got to sneak around in your room. \nAlso, I get the whole permission to borrow things, but maybe set some ground rules of a few things he can experiment with so he doesn't feel like he's got to ask you every time if he's still feeling like he wants to try things in private. \nI'd also suggest you let him keep some things of his own in your room. If he buys his own makeup or clothing he simply may not feel comfortable storing it in his room, so allowing him a spot in your closet to keep a few things may allow him to explore with his own things, without feeling like someone might find them in his room.", "NTA just be gentle because if he's hiding it means he's scared. Maybe ask if he'll go makeup shopping with you and help you pick some colors or something. On a side note YOU ROCK. It's amazing to see somebody not care about their loved ones sexuality. So thank you from the bottom of my biheart", "NTA. However, I wouldn\u2019t tell him you saw him. If he\u2019s questioning his sexuality and experimenting he might not be ready for people to know or talk about it. I\u2019d let him address it when he\u2019s ready. Just be loving and supporting of him in every aspect you can of his daily life.", "NTA, ask him if he wants to go shopping. Make a good bonding trip out of it.", "NTA- like you said makeup is expensive, and he\u2019s confided you before. No matter your identity, you don\u2019t just take things that don\u2019t belong to you.

Boundaries are set for a reason.\r It seems like you are a very caring person and have a healthy relationship with your brother. It seems he may be curious. You could have a heart to heart with him and support him.", "NTA at all. I think it will be nice that he can share this with someone, and you as his sister being supportive and helping him would probably mean the world to him.", "NTA, I personally would prefer it (I assume, I can't really put myself in his shoes) if the person who broached the subject to me basically said \"ya idgaf honestly, but makeup aint cheap\" I'd find the icebreaker/'diversion' you could say to be really refreshing and relieving. I think it'd be fine if you did it in a non confrontational way, like in an understanding manner. Which it sounds like you're all about. Maybe just do it when you're both alone so no one can barge in just in case?", "NTA and just be calm & matter of fact & fairly brief. \n\n\u201cOh btw I don\u2019t mind sharing stuff in general but my make up is really expensive and it\u2019s a really bad idea for hygiene reasons to share eye make up, so I\u2019ve put the stuff I don\u2019t mind you borrowing in (this place)\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s not able to buy his own supplies at this stage (because of money or eg small town embarrassment) then it would be kind to buy him a small selection before this conversation - or if you think he\u2019d prefer to have input on colours etc then make him the offer when you talk to him.", "NTA, tho i'd say to avoid confrontation. Instead, when the time is right, start by saying that you love him and only then mention that you noticed him going through your stuff. And QUICKLY (before he gets a chance to react) add that its fine, and you're happy for him (maybe hug him if thata what you do). Talk about it a little while. \n\nAnd only AFTER all of that, ask him to ask you before borrowing something. Also if you feel like it, then you might want to add that you'd be happy to buy something for him (in a way that you'd go to store instead of him, not that you'd pay for it). \n\nIts 101 of resolving conflicts. Avoid being accusatory at all cost. If you have doubts wether or not it might sound accusatory - always assume that it does. Especially since you dont have anything to accuse him of. Because, as i'm sure you know, he didnt asked you not because he didnt wanted to, but probably because he was ashamed of it, thought you wouldnt agree, that you could laugh it out etc. If you settle that, and show that you support him, then i'm pretty sure he wont have issues with asking you for permission. And in case he still would - propose to buy some stuff for him. Ask him what of yours cosmetics/clothes he like, and offer to buy them his own, then he wont have to ask you every time.\n\nOh, and just something i thought might be important: give him privacy. If he asks you for idk, an eyeliner and you agree, then dont expect that he has to show you how he looks. If you want, then offer help, but dont insist. And when he'll feel comfortable enough, then he should came to you himself.", "I think it might be best to just try talking to him. \"Suggesting\" he might look good with eyeliner perhaps... Go from there.\n\nNTA whatever you decide. If you do end up embarrassing him then that's on him.", "NTA. I\u2019d buy him his own (if I had the funds), or do a session with him. Say \u2018I\u2019m trying a new look will you help or can I do yours? We can hang out,  music and snacks and try out these looks I\u2019ve found on Instagram\u2019 (for eg). \n\nThen later say, if you want to borrow anything let me know", "Tbh I don\u2019t think I\u2019d only address the fact that your brother was taking/using your things without permission. It doesn\u2019t matter what it was, you should always ask. \nI wouldn\u2019t make a big deal of it, probably just say something like \u2018If you need to use some make up, can you ask first please? It\u2019s getting expensive\u2019. Then give him a wink and a hug and carry on with your day. \nHe then knows that it\u2019s not what he\u2019s wearing that is the issue, it\u2019s the taking without asking. If he\u2019s confided in you before, when he\u2019s ready he will confide in you again", "NTA. Just be matter of fact and say if you want to explore that\u2019s fine. Just ask first.

Maybe get him a dress too. I mean, it's not horrible, and he has a sister to be his cover while he figures it out. Plus, this prolly wasn't the first time, and he could prolly use lessons on makeup. It could be a wonderful bonding time. No matter what he decides", "NTA  \n\n\nYou ask WIBTA? depends but based on your post it seems like his mental health is critical to you. So you have two points to make #1 a saw you... #2 thats my stuff come on bro...  \n\n\nso drop both quickly in private maybe a drive cause no where to run out of embarassment.  \nso be like hey bro so the other day i came home saw you were in my room and we need to talk about it... now stop there about the clothing and makeup wearing and focus on who's it is and it's cost explain you would love to get and store a privete kit for him in your room to cover for him and then tell him better outfits for his frame and guage him keep him enguaged and really honesly play up the money and style clash and play down the embarassing part offer a solution and be his haven i think you asking for advise is clearly a sign of your maturity about this situation and your borther will be fine likely better than fine if he trusts you and it sounds like he should", "Why don't you sit down on an afternoon and go through YouTube videos learning new makeup and hair techniques - much less confrontational and could be fun and allow you not to have to bring it up.

I had to.", "Your intentions are clearly well-meaning and you're willing to help your brother explore his identity, it's very reasonable you just want him to ask before borrowing your belongings \u2014 it would be the same if you had a sister who used your makeup without asking.

Lots of crying and hugging. Other trans performers stopped by as well throughout the evening, and since we had a table right by the stage (I bribed the hostess for it) we were right in the middle of all the action.
