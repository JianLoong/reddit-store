You need to learn to respect them. And don\u2019t come at me with \u201c I was aiming for her torso\u201d. I don\u2019t care. Society may teach men it\u2019s ok to disrespect women\u2019s boundaries. It\u2019s not.", "YTA. Why are you almost 30 acting like you\u2019re 13", "I don\u2019t usually comment on these because I read them for entertainment but YTA, big time! As someone who straightens their hair and has gotten the routine down to 1 hour from 2 hours I can tell you what you did definitely pissed her off and warranted her behavior. Personally I would have gone off on you so you should be glad all you were faced with was silence.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nGrow up.", "YTA. You ignored her clearly stated boundary. A child would know better.", "Dude come on. Your friend set a boundary and you intentionally disrespected it. Of course YTA. What else could you possibly think we'd say?", "YTA- You knew she didn't want to get her hair wet and did an action that got her hair wet. That's fucking rude. \n\nBased on this I can only assume you know very little to nothing about haircare, the products can be expensive, and how long it takes from someone with really curly hair to straighten their hair etc.  This could additionally have layers of her being a POC and thus making it extra rude in my opinion because often their haircare is way more effort.  Overall sounds like you don't even understand the core reason why she is upset,\n\nShe made a boundary- I don't want to get my hair wet because I didn't bring things to fix it etc. \n\nYou then proceed to break that boundary by SPLASHING HER, knowing she didn't want it. That resulted in her having to BUY more hair products that she probably didn't need otherwise. \n\nThe problem isn't the hair is the fact you're a dick that doesn't care about others boundaries and thought it would be funny. Then it wasn't, wow. Surprise surprise people don't like their boundaries crossed especially when it results in them having to buy something to fix it.", "YTA \n\nAre you sure you\u2019re 27? How childish and rude. You should reimburse her for the product", "What\u2019s your excuse for not respecting her?", "YTA. I can\u2019t stand when people sit at the edge of the pool and then get upset about people around them splashing around. But you didn\u2019t splash around her; you splashed directly AT her knowing it would make her upset. Hair aside, having water thrown directly in your face while dry is super uncomfortable; you might has well have slapped her.", "How is this even a question. YTA", "And they are in their late 20s\u2026..not 13 anymore!", "I hate this shit so much. I have an absolute fear of water on my face. It\u2019s legit. Being splashed and having water on my face when I\u2019m not expecting it is really overwhelming for me. I know it\u2019s my issue and it\u2019s dumb and I have to overcome it. I\u2019ve sucked it up over the years as a mom to not pass on my anxiety to my kids and to facilitate them having a normal life going to water parks and pools and such. I manage my fears because it\u2019s my responsibility BUT someone who does it intentionally after I ask them not to is an absolute asshole. You are doing something to my body without my consent.", "This is just my opinion, and I\u2019m not saying the OP was right, but I think there\u2019s an \u201cassumed risk\u201d of getting wet when pool-side.\n\nIf I were intent on staying dry, I\u2019d stay WAY back from the water.", "I think that\u2019s unrealistic; when pool-side I think there\u2019s ALWAYS a risk of getting wet.\n\nYou want to stay dry?  Don\u2019t go near water.", "agreed, OP is YTA. Also a bully.", "so much this", "As I always tell my kids and my husband, it's only a joke if BOTH people involved think it's funny. If only one person is laughing,  then it's mean and possibly bullying.", "Honestly seems like OP just refused to listen or don\u2019t know how to listen", "I wasn\u2019t aiming for her hair and face. I was trying to get hair torso and I guess I tried too hard", "And with the apology a gift card for some hair products.", ">that isn't cute. It's sad\n\nYes, this is it.  People will explicitly state something (\"don't splash me\") and other grown ass adults will think it is \"cute\" to do exactly that thing.  Then, *splasher* understandably  gets mad and, instead of apologizing, accuses *spalshee* of being \"no fun\" or whatever.", "And pay for her hair products. YTA", "This. The amount of money it costs for curly hair is unreal. I have naturally curly myself and have been getting blowouts as late because I love my hair straight. I\u2019d be beyond pissed if someone did this to me.", "And she has to likely throw those products away cause they are too large  to take on the plane. Or they will explode in a check bag. Easy had to spend $10-30 extra to fix her hair. And just an overall pain in the a$$ that didn\u2019t need to haooen", "i guess this was the least traumatizing way for op to show his friends how he deals with boundaries\u2026 and then he\u2019s surprised that when people realize he won\u2019t take no for an answer they don\u2019t want to hang anymore. weird, op. shitty. yta.", "This. I wish I could give you an award. Why do people think no is yes with women?", "Whoa, whoa, whoa - this guy is definitely an AH,  but lets not drag every person with XY chromosomes into this.", "A guy who doesn't respect consent in one way doesn't respect it in other ways", "Right and maybe also for fun, he should explicitly state his non-consent for something to happen to his body, and then she should do it.  Fun!", "Ever notice that when the word \u201cplayful\u201d is used, it\u2019s usually said to excuse bad behavior?", "What if the friend still wanted to talk to the others? sure she could expect to get a bit of water on her but purposefully splashing her after being asked not to is rude", "If she accidentally got splashed this would be a valid comment. OP did it on purpose just to be an AH so it\u2019s not", "I have managed to sit on the edge of the pool with my feet in and not get my hair wet because my friends aren\u2019t asshats.", "yeah, but someone purposely splashing water at you isn't included in the \"assumed risk\"", "There's a difference between an honest accident that would have caused her to get wet vs purposeful splash that got her wet.", "Found OP\u2019s real account.", "So if I leave food out and explicitly ask my friends not to eat it, and they eat it anyway, it's my fault because there was an assumed risk of leaving my food out around people who could eat it?", "OP is 27, not 7 or even a teenager. He should've known better.", "Sure that is true but literally OP went out of his way to splash her to the point it hit her face and hair. This isn\u2019t like some accidental splash, OP intentionally splashed her", "Always a risk, yes.  And if the splashes had been inadvertent I'd say the friend took the risk.  But intentionally splashing someone who said they didn't want to get wet makes OP YTA.", "There's a difference between an accidental splash and intentionally splashing someone that said they didn't want that. No means no in any context.", "Or don\u2019t go near assholes. You did this deliberately. YTA", "Just FYI women with curly hair take waaaaaaay longer to style their hair because it's a long, difficult process. \n\nI expect to be splashed by kids but not by an adult \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYTA", "This wasn't about an accident - which was a risk. OP deliberately splashed her.", "I don\u2019t think she would have been so upset if it was just an accident. It\u2019s the fact that OP did it on purpose after she asked all of them not to\u2026 not that hard to see the difference.", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting down voted so much, I agree. If you literally go ANYWHERE with water, there\u2019s ALWAYS the risk of getting wet no matter how clear you make that you want to stay dry smh", "As a girl with naturally curly hair, that's my thoughts exactly...", "He knows how to listen.  He was just being a bratty-ass and ruined someone else's good time to amuse himself.   Then went around asking everyone like a child to make it her fault.   He wanted everyone to say she's an over reactor and when he got 50/50 he wants REDDIT to say it.", "OP knew she didn't want to get splashed, but just didn't care.  People like him thing they are being fun, but they are really just immature and obnoxious.  \n\nPersonal story: I have had people try and physically drag me onto a dance floor after I explicitly said I did not want to dance. I would resist, and they would literally tug on my arms or push my back. Then, when I finally had enough and told them they are being shitty friends, they apologized and respected my wishes, but not before we worked through their \"I was just being fun\" BS.", "Comparison. You are dressed to go out, you walk by the pool and someone throws water on you you get all wet. Is that funny to you even though the water thrower was aiming for your shoes and missed. YTAH and need to limit your pranks.", "Bro, she was sitting at the edge of the pool for a reason you literally mention in this story. If she wanted to get her hair wet, she would be IN the pool", "Apologize with a $50 gift card for hair products and stop picking on people.  Grow up. It wasn't an accident. You were being reckless.", "You realize this is a pathetic excuse? She asked not to be splashed and you splashed her. You\u2019re an idiot and an AH\u2026and a bully.", "You aren\u2019t twelve. You knew what you were doing. Next time be respectful. YTA.", "Why were you trying to splash her to begin with?", "So you have shit aim, **and** don\u2019t care about the boundaries around you people will set? You don\u2019t sound like a good friend.", "Bully is the word you are looking for here", "You sound insufferable. Why is an adult trying to splash someone at a pool like a child. Grow up", "Fellow curly girl here. I would have a hard time not punching someone in the dick over this. I'm angry on this poor girl's behalf.", "I second this. I don't have curly hair, but I have coarse waves. Most travel size styling products aren't good for people with textured hair.", "Agree with the sentiment, however, I'm afraid of fish so I don't go to the aquarium or fish market.", "And yet she got soaked!", "Yes.", "When I cross the street there\u2019s a risk of being hit by a motor vehicle or cyclist. Someone aiming their vehicle AT ME is entirely different.", "Big difference between accidentally doing xyz and intentionally doing xyz", "Because OP didn't accidentally splash his friend, he intentionally did so after being asked not to. That is the difference.", "OP did it on purpose, this wasn't an accident.  Sitting near the pool means that you are at risk of getting *accidentally* splashed.  She asked OP to not get her wet and OP did it anyway.  It would be a different story if someone shoved OP and they accidentally splashed her.\n\nIf the pool had been lifeguarded OP would have found themselves getting their ass chewed by the guard.  That is because we were trained to consider splashing *horseplay* which could lead to other more s*erious* infractions and potential injuries.  I ordered a kid to leave the pool after they tried to disguise *a punch* as splashing someone.  Their excuse when I yelled at them was \"I was trying to splash them, and I missed the water.\"  I just looked at the kid and said \"Uh, huh sure, how do you explain the fact that your hand was a foot above the water?  Try again.\"  I told him to go home after I found out this was the *third* time a guard had yelled at him for punching someone.\n\ntagging u/Princess-Reader", "True or it could be both this and OP doesn\u2019t know how to listen", "Yup!  Pathetic.", "Also a curly girl. I keep mine natural and that's still a lot of time and money to maintain.", "People think bc it\u2019s naturally curly, it should be  easy to maintain when it\u2019s the exact opposite.  Feel so bad for her.", "Because OP intentionally splashed water at her.\n\nAnd the intent is the difference.\n\nIf he had accidently splashed her, then that would be different. But oP intentionally went out of his way to do the exact opposite of what his friend asked. Furthermore, to splash enough water from the pool to the person sitting by the pool to ruin their hair took special effort on OPs part.", "If anything it\u2019s an \u201cassumed risk\u201d of having shitty jealous friends, not of being by the pool after explicitly expressing your boundary to your friends.", "As a result of an intentional act. It didn\u2019t have to happen. That\u2019s the point.", "SO OP - how many accounts do you have?", "or empathize.", "Possibly he's got a crush on the cure girl in the playground also", "Yes, sometimes I straighten mine just so I can wear it straight for a few days and not have to reset it every morning, so it's worth the effort up front. That's why the woman was pissed, I bet she had her hair figured out for the next few days and OP completely ruined it and has the audacity to wonder why she is mad.", "Exactly - the amount of work and products it takes to make curly hair look good is crazy. For people who are surprised by this, search the hashtag #curlygirl on Instagram for a glimpse at all the videos on curl training, brush styling, diffusing, etc. We don't do it for fun, it's because if we don't our hair looks like a damn bird's nest by default!", "Yup, agreed", "I must sleep on my head, I could only be straight-ish a day. I just quit messing with it altogether and just wash, condition and oil as needed. Now waiting for it to grow, I lost it and it's just now touching my shoulders.", "Yeah, at Xmas, my brother's gf at the time was telling me how my hair was so beautiful that day and how she wished she had curly hair like me. It's true that on that day, I took a shower, put some mousse in, straightened my bangs and was good to go, but I explained that if I don't have time to shower in the morning and the curls aren't great, I put my hair in a ponytail (or other updo). She was styling her straight hair with some nice waves with the flat iron and she was like \"If it's not nice, can't you just fix it?\" No, not really without washing it. (A wet reset is more than I can handle, personally. )", "Me too, my head sweats at night so if it's not too hot and I don't get too sweaty, I hit it with a flat iron or curling iron for a few minutes to iron out the kinks and I'm good to go for a few days.
