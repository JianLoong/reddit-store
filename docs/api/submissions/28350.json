You've done nothing wrong, but I get why you fear looking standoffish.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, you can pop by his office later to thank him for the kind offer and for making you feel included as a new team member. Being diabetic is a common, responsible reason to stick to your preplanned meals. While you are able to adjust your insulin dosage in the case you do need to eat at work, you've found your current diet works really well and you do your absolute best to stick to it, doctor's orders!

Peer pressure and unsolicited opinions/comments from coworkers about food. \n\nNot healthy, just like the food always picked for the team. Pizza, subs, donuts, etc.. it\u2019s always sugar and carbs (and then bosses expect you not to crash, get sleepy and less productive after). \n\nAlso, aside from the health aspect, you don\u2019t have to fall in line to put your hand out for something free like all your coworkers.", "NTA. You can just say \"No thank you, but please enjoy your food.\"", "I get it and your NTA got turning down a meal. But I do question how you are a diabetic and only eating one meal a day. Your sugar levels would be all out of whack and you would be crashing long before you get to your 1 meal a day unless you are doing shake supplementation, which I really hope you\u2019re doing something. Because if you\u2019re not managing your food properly you\u2019re going to end up with a world more medical issues.  \nIt sounds like you\u2019ve got a lot of issues that you aren\u2019t addressing well.", "Nta tell people that you have serious teeth health problems", "NTA - As someone who is in charge of other people, I'd be more worried if you took food when you didn't want it vs be offended if you said no to the offer.

Pull your boss aside and explain that you have dietary restrictions due to health issues so you only eat foods that you yourself prepare", "I hate food culture at work. It\u2019s usually toxic and weird. I have a several dietary restrictions, a gastric device and I really just want some time to myself at lunch. If it\u2019s a birthday lunch, I go and participate but don\u2019t eat. Everyone\u2019s used to it by now. I just tell people I have severe allergies and can\u2019t eat out but that\u2019s it.

My body was still in what's called the honey moon phase for a long time meaning my body was still producing insulin I had a treatment performed on me a new treatment called tzield. I received these infusions each day over a course of two weeks. Its supposed to delay the onset of diabetes for years. I've been going strong since then its bought me some more time. I also dont take care of myself like you said but that's the reason I'm not dead right now basically", "You don't need to disclose exactly why you don't want to eat and ideally no one would bug you about it you.

I think your co-workers might be worried that if someone doesn't get the free lunch that the bus might not offer them."]}
