We have been in the same group of friends basically since we came to this school. We are both weirdo music nerds and luckily we found a group to suit us. We have been together for a little over a year. Before we got together he dated another mutual friend I will name Chloe. They dated for like 6 months 4 years ago near the beginning of college. \n\nWhen we first started talking romantically he was joking about his brief relationship with Chloe and how he would sing her this super cheesy 80s song. (Bf plays piano and really likes to sing. He\u2019s pretty good but when he\u2019s drunk he thinks he\u2019s really good lol). I know the song after listening to it but I didn\u2019t know it before then. \n\nDone with backstory. We were at a small party at our friends apartment on Saturday. He was staying by my place and I drove because I barely drink. It\u2019s the friend group so Chloe is there. No big deal we\u2019ve hungout so so many times all together. My bf is super drunk at this point he\u2019s got the crazy eyes going too. \n\nHe wandered off by himself and sat down at the piano to start playing around. He\u2019s doing this for awhile than all of a sudden starts playing and singing that fucking song. I gave him a look and went over there. I sarcastically said \u201coh trying to cheer Chloe up?\u201d And he just barks \u201cPLEASE LET ME FINISH\u201d I laugh sarcastically and he barks the same thing. \n\nI said f it and grabbed the keys and went home  before he even finished the song. I started getting drunk Texts about ubers being super expensive and he\u2019d have to pay almost 80$ to get to his place after I told him he can\u2019t come to mine. \n\nSince then he has been angry about me leaving him and he keeps switching between he was really drunk and he just likes the song as his defense of his actions. He did the \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt hurt I really meant nothing by it\u201d shtick.

It's doubtful he was trying to accomplish anything by playing that song, and certainly not consciously. It's kinda understandable that you *could* get upset about that, but we shouldn't pretend our past relationships didn't happen just because they're over. Reminiscing is ok, and people are especially gonna do that while drunk. Your response was a bit out of proportion.", " YTA.   Huge overreaction.  He wasn\u2019t pining or hitting on Chloe in front of you.   He was only singing a song.  It\u2019s just as likely that drunkenly played it cuz he saw her and it popped into his head.  Nothing more, nothing less.   You way overthought this and your insecurity showed.  He apologized.   Now it\u2019s your turn.", "YTA. Your boyfriend likes to sing 80s songs, he got drunk and sang an 80s song. That relates to his ex...how exactly? You seem pretty insecure.", "YTA. I expect such a drama from a 14 years old, but not a grown woman.", "YTA. He loves to sing and he sang a song. He probably used to sing it to the ex because he liked the song (likely sang it before he was with her too). Unless you have some real actual reasons to think he's been secretly pining for chloe for the last 4 years then ffs, it's just a song and he was drunk. You don't tell someone you'll be their sober ride home and ditch them without a REALLY good reason. This is just a dumb thing to put your relationship on the line over (and that's exactly what you've done, whether you realize it or not).", ">I sarcastically said \u201coh trying to cheer Chloe up?\u201d\n\nDid Chloe actually need cheering up, or were you the first you make this about her?\n\n>Edit: if anyone cares the song is **\u201cit might be you\u201d** by Stephen bishop\n\nRead that title a few times until the irony sinks in. \n\nYTA", "YTA because it was such a dramatic reaction. I personally wouldn't tolerate behavior like that, no offense.", "It was just a song. Yes, it might have some connection with an ex, but is he never supposed to sing it ever again? Get over yourself. YTA.\n\nIt might have been the only song he could remember how to play while drunk. \n\nUnless he was making googley eyes at Chloe while he sang it, you over reacted. Insecurity on show.", "YTA and extremely insecure\u2026but what I\u2019m not understanding is that if you\u2019re so certain that he sang this song because he still has feelings for Chloe then why are you with him?", "If I had to eliminate all the songs (and books, TV shows etc) that make me think of the ex I broke up with years ago, the overlap is such that I'd have a mostly empty playlist. YTA. Good music is good music, not a yearning to get back together with someone.", "YTA. That sounds like a gross overreaction on your part. They dated a very short time years ago, & he likes singing all the time? That doesn't sound like he did anything wrong. He was just drunk, & seeing her made him think of a song. I have songs that I think of with old friends & exes, but still liking the song doesn't mean I want to hook up with the person that made me think of the song. That would be ridiculous. \n\nI don't know, maybe after more comments or edits there will be additional info that will change my mind, but as the first commenter, it sounds like you got jealous over nothing & created a huge problem for your boyfriend because you conflated drunk singing with drunk booty calling.", "YTA, it's just a song... is he not allowed to ever listen to or sing it again bc of that one time he sang it to an ex 6 years ago? That's a little odd. \n\nIf it did bother you THAT much, telling him it made you uncomfortable would be a better route than a sarcastic passive-aggressive remark to a drunk person.", "100% YTA. The level of difference between \"he sang a song that idk if he was trying to swoon an ex or not, and I didnt even ask\" and \"the DD ditches your ass at a party\" is pretty huge tbh. This absolutely deserved a discussion, and tbh, if you had actualy said you were leaving if he continued I would be on your side, but to blind side him with 0 ride is an absolutely disproportionate reposnce. I mean, yall even said you are music nerds. Im not gunna stop loving a song just cause of breakup FFS.", "esh", "Oof\u2026I\u2019m leaning that you\u2019re not, but I have questions. Obviously this song reminds him of her, but does he listen to/play it otherwise? I need INFO. Was he looking at her while singing it (like singing it to her)?", "ESH\n\nHe was a drunk AH.\n\nYou were a sober AH.\n\nThe end.", "YTA. Being drunk makes you do stupid things, but if he likes singing he'd probably start to sing when he's drunk. But you overreacted, especially because they dated for a short amount of time. Just because he sang something about his ex doesn't mean he wants to get back together again.", "Yta obviously", "Nta he was serenading a long ago ex while drunk and now you\u2019re the bad guy? He could have sung literally any other song.", "ESH - you were his DD and you ditched him when got drunk and acted a fool.  He shouldn\u2019t have acted a fool and it sounds like everyone was basically being short and mean to each other.", "YTA. He sang that song to Chloe because he likes singing the song and probably thinks his version is impressive and would delight everyone. He might\u2019ve been drunk enough to deprioritize the connection to Chloe.", "Ah, young dramatic relationships, gotta love em. He was a drunk fool, you got huffy and ditched him. ESH", "Going against the grain here but NTA.\n\nYou know that song is something to them. If my bf sang a song like that linking to an ex I\u2019d be pissed. So I feel you.", "ESH. You should have paid for his ride home since you were his DD, but I'm siding with you here. He drunkenly played that song FOR his ex. He didn't pick it out of the blue for no reason.", "NTA. \n\nDude showed his ass big time, and isn't owning up to any of it.", "I don't get these comments lol. He's at a party with his ex and starts to play the ONE song he used to sing to her in front of everyone..... Like he couldn't play any other song in the universe?\n\nIn my opinion you didn't over react at all. And I would of left him there too. NTA", "Difficult to say. Does he know other songs on piano by heart? Maybe it is just something he played so often that it is his go to song and really meant nothing by it. I\u2019ve played \u201cThe Scientist\u201d by Coldplay for every ex because it\u2019s the only song I\u2019m confident in without a music sheet on piano. Just something to have fun or show off what small talent I have there. \n\nI once had an ex, together six years, who got drunk and did drugs (drugs was a boundary) and I had to drive an hour to pick him up. I still stuck to being his DD. He was drunk enough to cross a boundary we had for years. He was sorry in the end but it ultimately did catalyst other problems that made us no longer compatible. \n\nSo ESH. Can see both ways.", "YTA You completely overreacted. He was drunk and like so many drunk people, they do shit without any deeper meaning behind it.", "NTA. Time to move on. His time is up.", "Oh my god I cannot believe all the people here saying you are in the wrong, you are absolutely NTA here. I would have done the same thing. What comes out when drunk is there when sober. He obviously got all wistful after seeing Chloe and is now mad because he acted like an AH. He's not over her, period. Get you a new man.", "ESH, you shouldn\u2019t have overreacted over a stupid old song that looks like it means nothing here. That being said your boyfriend should get the picture you\u2019re not comfortable with him singing that in this context when you mention it to him. Just my opinion", "NTA. Sounds like he may be a binge drinker. Nothing good comes put of that. I saw plenty of that when I was living in residence at university.", "Look you've been with him a year, you need to have a proper conversation about Chloe, he needs to be honest with you about her. Totally honest.", "23 male is like 15 in maturity.", "ESH but mildly. He was drunk, you were weirded out, he was rude, you left. He probably meant zero by it and you\u2019re overthinking it (just based on your other comments) but drunk yelling isn\u2019t something you need to tolerate. I commented elsewhere and I hope that at least gave you a laugh, but here\u2019s the judgment. Good luck out there.", "YTA, that was a pretty immature overreaction to someone who's drunk. If you were upset you should've just took him home with you and confronted him in the morning. The bad part wasn't that you got mad at him, but the fact that you left him drunk at a party is the low-life part. If he was  \"super drunk\" drunk then luckily he made it home, but just imagine had something happened to him, you would be regretting it forever, for a song he likes and you just supposed it was for that Chloe chick?", "YTA. \n- ASSumed your boyfriend is still pining over some girl he dated 4 years ago.\n- ASSumed your music nerd boyfriend was singing to the girl he dated 4 years ago. \n- agreed to DD your boyfriend, and then left him there drunk without telling him you were leaving. \n\nJealous.

It says more about OP\u2019s insecurities than any reflection on him. Either there are things in her past that she needs to work through or OP should provide more background if these insecurities are specific to this relationship so that we can reassess.

I\u2019ve seen him play so many other songs. \n\nSo far the drinking is more of an annoyance than a serious problem.", "Isn\u2019t that overreacting a bit? They barely dated and it was years ago. As far as we know, there hasn\u2019t been a pattern of behavior. It\u2019s a bit silly to end a relationship over misunderstanding what could ultimately be nothing. \n\nOP, what else do you know about their past relationship? Why did they break up?", "He\u2019s usually pretty great.. just gets carried away with the liquor sometimes", "I thought we did talk about her before awhile ago but maybe I need to have another talk. I don\u2019t want to seem crazy", "What a great excuse for his idiocy. Speaking like that is why men get away with so much.", "You mind immediately went to \"He's trying to cheer Chloe up\", with no indication that Chloe was in need of cheering up, or feeling un-cheerful at all?", "Is this your first time around drunk people? THEY don't even know why they do shit, you're not supposed to even try to figure it out.", "You're projecting YOUR insecurity onto him.

Or you\u2019re guessing? I\u2019m going to guess that you\u2019re guessing. And I\u2019m also going to guess even further that that song holds a particular insecurity for you already because he shared it with her. From what you\u2019ve told us (and I will admit I haven\u2019t read all of your responses) he was drunk and therefore not thinking clearly. So my final judgement is ESH. Him for getting drunk and possibly being nostalgic, but regardless inconsiderate. You for agreeing to be the DD and leaving without even talking to him about what he did.\n\nI understand him playing that song with her there hurt you. But unless you talked to him about what he was doing and/or why he was doing it or if he had intentionally been singing it to her you acted irrationally.", "Doesn\u2019t really matter - part of being a DD is dealing with drunk people.  If you can\u2019t deal with drunk people, don\u2019t be the DD.", "Because he singing a song even his girlfriend knows he thinks about his ex to.

Do yourself a favor and don't have that talk and don't show him this post.", "Because why would he play that? He\u2019s never done that before.", "Um because that was \"Chloe's song\" he used to sing to her - it was sarcasm on OPs part, and justified", "Obviously he was thinking something in that moment", "Him singing that made me uncomfortable and I might be uneasy in the future around her for a little while. I\u2019m sure it will blow over", "I guess I jumped to a conclusion.", "Why would a talk hurt", "Yeah but like, your reasoning is not making sense", "I doubt it.", "Maybe it's really as simple as the song came in his head and he started singing it, sometimes it's really not complicated at all.

Now he knows you don't trust him.", "You\u2019re human, and sometimes that happens. What you need to do now is figure out how to move forward. If you want to save your relationship, you need to have a serious heart to heart with your bf. Air your insecurities about that song and his current relationship with her in a calm and civil way because it seems like as much as you want to be okay that she\u2019s still a friend, you\u2019re really not. Ask him to honestly answer you why he played that song if you\u2019re unsure (if he even remembers because alcohol). But it also seems like you have some hard questions to ask yourself too. Don\u2019t beat yourself up too bad for jumping to conclusions, because despite what a lot of people on this app want to say, we\u2019re all human and capable of making mistakes, being insecure, and jumping to conclusions.

You were hurt so acted irrationally but just clear the air now. Good luck.", "Idk I can\u2019t help but think she is why he played it. Drunk or not it\u2019s what he was thinking.", "Lovely answer.", "I\u2019m obviously not him, but I\u2019d say he was probably thinking \u201cI feel goooood. Oh hey, piano! It\u2019s piano time because I\u2019m the piano man. What to play, what to play\u2026 I suddenly can\u2019t remember any songs that exist. Oh hey there\u2019s Chloe. Oh shit - That song! TIME TO SHINE!\u201d", "Why did you post in here if you're not going to hear what anyone is saying to you?

You're not hearing us anymore than you heard him. Just break up with him then, this is ridiculous drama over a song and it doesn't seem you're old enough or secure enough to have a relationship?", "You\u2019re not in his head. Sometimes it\u2019s conducive  to give people the benefit of the doubt, and realize that you\u2019re projecting your shit onto him. If there are no other, real pointers? Pretty harsh punishment, IMO, he was drunk. For all you know he heard that song recently and just felt like singing it because he likes it. Doesn\u2019t automatically mean he has motives. YTA", "I hate to be the one to tell you this, OP, but you're never going to know exactly what he's thinking. You're never going to know exactly what anyone is thinking. No one ever does.\n\nIf you want to be in a happy relationship, you are going to have to accept that you're not going to know what someone else is thinking all of the time. You can't possibly know that. You have to decide to trust what he tells you, that it really didn't mean anything, and let it go--or you shouldn't be in this relationship.", "Thought police, much?", "He should leave you. You're stuck in Middleschool mindset. Seek help."]}
