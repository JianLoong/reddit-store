I know the song after listening to it but I didn\u2019t know it before then. \n\nDone with backstory. We were at a small party at our friends apartment on Saturday. He was staying by my place and I drove because I barely drink. It\u2019s the friend group so Chloe is there. No big deal we\u2019ve hungout so so many times all together. My bf is super drunk at this point he\u2019s got the crazy eyes going too. \n\nHe wandered off by himself and sat down at the piano to start playing around. He\u2019s doing this for awhile than all of a sudden starts playing and singing that fucking song. I gave him a look and went over there. I sarcastically said \u201coh trying to cheer Chloe up?\u201d And he just barks \u201cPLEASE LET ME FINISH\u201d I laugh sarcastically and he barks the same thing. \n\nI said f it and grabbed the keys and went home  before he even finished the song. I started getting drunk Texts about ubers being super expensive and he\u2019d have to pay almost 80$ to get to his place after I told him he can\u2019t come to mine. \n\nSince then he has been angry about me leaving him and he keeps switching between he was really drunk and he just likes the song as his defense of his actions.

It's doubtful he was trying to accomplish anything by playing that song, and certainly not consciously. It's kinda understandable that you *could* get upset about that, but we shouldn't pretend our past relationships didn't happen just because they're over. Reminiscing is ok, and people are especially gonna do that while drunk. Your response was a bit out of proportion.", " YTA.   Huge overreaction.  He wasn\u2019t pining or hitting on Chloe in front of you.   He was only singing a song.  It\u2019s just as likely that drunkenly played it cuz he saw her and it popped into his head.  Nothing more, nothing less.   You way overthought this and your insecurity showed.  He apologized.   Now it\u2019s your turn.", "YTA. Your boyfriend likes to sing 80s songs, he got drunk and sang an 80s song. That relates to his ex...how exactly? You seem pretty insecure.", "YTA. I expect such a drama from a 14 years old, but not a grown woman.", "YTA. He loves to sing and he sang a song. He probably used to sing it to the ex because he liked the song (likely sang it before he was with her too). Unless you have some real actual reasons to think he's been secretly pining for chloe for the last 4 years then ffs, it's just a song and he was drunk. You don't tell someone you'll be their sober ride home and ditch them without a REALLY good reason. This is just a dumb thing to put your relationship on the line over (and that's exactly what you've done, whether you realize it or not).", ">I sarcastically said \u201coh trying to cheer Chloe up?\u201d\n\nDid Chloe actually need cheering up, or were you the first you make this about her?\n\n>Edit: if anyone cares the song is **\u201cit might be you\u201d** by Stephen bishop\n\nRead that title a few times until the irony sinks in. \n\nYTA", "YTA because it was such a dramatic reaction. I personally wouldn't tolerate behavior like that, no offense.", "It was just a song. Yes, it might have some connection with an ex, but is he never supposed to sing it ever again? Get over yourself. YTA.\n\nIt might have been the only song he could remember how to play while drunk. \n\nUnless he was making googley eyes at Chloe while he sang it, you over reacted. Insecurity on show.", "YTA and extremely insecure\u2026but what I\u2019m not understanding is that if you\u2019re so certain that he sang this song because he still has feelings for Chloe then why are you with him?", "If I had to eliminate all the songs (and books, TV shows etc) that make me think of the ex I broke up with years ago, the overlap is such that I'd have a mostly empty playlist. YTA. Good music is good music, not a yearning to get back together with someone.", "YTA. That sounds like a gross overreaction on your part. They dated a very short time years ago, & he likes singing all the time? That doesn't sound like he did anything wrong. He was just drunk, & seeing her made him think of a song. I have songs that I think of with old friends & exes, but still liking the song doesn't mean I want to hook up with the person that made me think of the song. That would be ridiculous. \n\nI don't know, maybe after more comments or edits there will be additional info that will change my mind, but as the first commenter, it sounds like you got jealous over nothing & created a huge problem for your boyfriend because you conflated drunk singing with drunk booty calling.", "YTA, it's just a song... is he not allowed to ever listen to or sing it again bc of that one time he sang it to an ex 6 years ago? That's a little odd. \n\nIf it did bother you THAT much, telling him it made you uncomfortable would be a better route than a sarcastic passive-aggressive remark to a drunk person.", "100% YTA. The level of difference between \"he sang a song that idk if he was trying to swoon an ex or not, and I didnt even ask\" and \"the DD ditches your ass at a party\" is pretty huge tbh. This absolutely deserved a discussion, and tbh, if you had actualy said you were leaving if he continued I would be on your side, but to blind side him with 0 ride is an absolutely disproportionate reposnce. I mean, yall even said you are music nerds. Im not gunna stop loving a song just cause of breakup FFS.", "esh", "Oof\u2026I\u2019m leaning that you\u2019re not, but I have questions.

Was he looking at her while singing it (like singing it to her)?", "ESH\n\nHe was a drunk AH.\n\nYou were a sober AH.\n\nThe end.", "YTA. Being drunk makes you do stupid things, but if he likes singing he'd probably start to sing when he's drunk. But you overreacted, especially because they dated for a short amount of time. Just because he sang something about his ex doesn't mean he wants to get back together again.", "Yta obviously", "Nta he was serenading a long ago ex while drunk and now you\u2019re the bad guy? He could have sung literally any other song.", "ESH - you were his DD and you ditched him when got drunk and acted a fool.  He shouldn\u2019t have acted a fool and it sounds like everyone was basically being short and mean to each other.", "YTA. He sang that song to Chloe because he likes singing the song and probably thinks his version is impressive and would delight everyone. He might\u2019ve been drunk enough to deprioritize the connection to Chloe.", "Ah, young dramatic relationships, gotta love em. He was a drunk fool, you got huffy and ditched him. ESH", "Going against the grain here but NTA.\n\nYou know that song is something to them. If my bf sang a song like that linking to an ex I\u2019d be pissed. So I feel you.", "ESH. You should have paid for his ride home since you were his DD, but I'm siding with you here. He drunkenly played that song FOR his ex. He didn't pick it out of the blue for no reason.", "NTA. \n\nDude showed his ass big time, and isn't owning up to any of it.", "I don't get these comments lol. He's at a party with his ex and starts to play the ONE song he used to sing to her in front of everyone..... Like he couldn't play any other song in the universe?\n\nIn my opinion you didn't over react at all. And I would of left him there too. NTA", "Difficult to say. Does he know other songs on piano by heart? Maybe it is just something he played so often that it is his go to song and really meant nothing by it. I\u2019ve played \u201cThe Scientist\u201d by Coldplay for every ex because it\u2019s the only song I\u2019m confident in without a music sheet on piano. Just something to have fun or show off what small talent I have there. \n\nI once had an ex, together six years, who got drunk and did drugs (drugs was a boundary) and I had to drive an hour to pick him up. I still stuck to being his DD. He was drunk enough to cross a boundary we had for years. He was sorry in the end but it ultimately did catalyst other problems that made us no longer compatible. \n\nSo ESH. Can see both ways.", "YTA You completely overreacted. He was drunk and like so many drunk people, they do shit without any deeper meaning behind it.", "NTA. Time to move on. His time is up.", "Oh my god I cannot believe all the people here saying you are in the wrong, you are absolutely NTA here. I would have done the same thing. What comes out when drunk is there when sober. He obviously got all wistful after seeing Chloe and is now mad because he acted like an AH. He's not over her, period. Get you a new man.", "ESH, you shouldn\u2019t have overreacted over a stupid old song that looks like it means nothing here. That being said your boyfriend should get the picture you\u2019re not comfortable with him singing that in this context when you mention it to him. Just my opinion", "NTA. Sounds like he may be a binge drinker. Nothing good comes put of that. I saw plenty of that when I was living in residence at university.", "Look you've been with him a year, you need to have a proper conversation about Chloe, he needs to be honest with you about her. Totally honest.", "23 male is like 15 in maturity.", "ESH but mildly. He was drunk, you were weirded out, he was rude, you left. He probably meant zero by it and you\u2019re overthinking it (just based on your other comments) but drunk yelling isn\u2019t something you need to tolerate. I commented elsewhere and I hope that at least gave you a laugh, but here\u2019s the judgment. Good luck out there.", "YTA, that was a pretty immature overreaction to someone who's drunk. If you were upset you should've just took him home with you and confronted him in the morning. The bad part wasn't that you got mad at him, but the fact that you left him drunk at a party is the low-life part. If he was  \"super drunk\" drunk then luckily he made it home, but just imagine had something happened to him, you would be regretting it forever, for a song he likes and you just supposed it was for that Chloe chick?", "YTA. \n- ASSumed your boyfriend is still pining over some girl he dated 4 years ago.\n- ASSumed your music nerd boyfriend was singing to the girl he dated 4 years ago. \n- agreed to DD your boyfriend, and then left him there drunk without telling him you were leaving. \n\nJealous.

From what you\u2019ve told us (and I will admit I haven\u2019t read all of your responses) he was drunk and therefore not thinking clearly. So my final judgement is ESH. Him for getting drunk and possibly being nostalgic, but regardless inconsiderate. You for agreeing to be the DD and leaving without even talking to him about what he did.\n\nI understand him playing that song with her there hurt you.

He sang a song he used to share with a woman he dated for 6 months years ago.....are you totally off you gourd?\n\nYou will be lucky to still have a bf after this stunt...I for one would loose all trust on you for abandoning me and a good deal of respect for you for having such a low opinion of me to think up this insane situation in your head over drunk singing a song", "YTA. This could be in guidelines for \"how to lose your boyfriend and push him towards his ex\". \n\nTime to fix it. Start with communicating your fears, maybe traumas.", "YTA. It\u2019s just a dumb song he likes to sing. He wasn\u2019t hooking up with Chloe in front of you to declaring his undying love for her. You grossly overreacted.", "YTA. I can understand being angry and such, but don\u2019t you know this isn\u2019t a safe world anymore? He could have been hurt. Regardless of what he does, he\u2019s a person and he is someone\u2019s son. What is with people just abandoning their SO out of anger?", "You sound exhausting. YTA", "I also think that OP is NTA. Maybe could have been handled differently but whatev's.\n\nBF is a dumb ass though. Piano and singing is a power move with the ladies. Best not disclose who else you've used your power moves on if you want to recycle them. Also, the song for the ex is the song for the ex.", "Wow you are super insecure dude", "YTA. Your insecurity is exhausting just reading through the replies. If you're like this constantly with him it's no wonder his drunk mind took him to somewhere and something that wasn't quite as draining", "How is it weird?\n\nThe likeliest explanation is that the (drunken) thought process went something like:\n\n- what to play?\n\n- ooh seeing Chloe reminds me of a song I\u2019ve not played in ages\n\n- that\u2019s quite a good song\n\n- I will play that song\n\nThe ONLY link to Chloe would have been that she reminded him about a song that he knows how to play, that he\u2019d not played in a while. \n\nIt\u2019s literally that simple. \n\nThere was nothing for you to get jealous / upset by - and definitely nothing worth storming out of the party for. \n\nYou need to apologise to your boyfriend & pay him back for the Uber you cost him, and work on yourself so you don\u2019t over react to \u201cnothing\u201d next time. \n\nIt might be too late though. Having a moment of bad judgment during a party is possibly forgivable (although abandoning him when you\u2019d promised to drive him is possibly annoying enough for him to end things). But doubling down on it after the fact, and insisting that you were right to be jealous over nothing is a massive red flag for him. If he is wise he will end things here. \n\nYou are throwing up many red flags. Not because of what you did at the party (although that was bad), but for still not seeing how irrational & unnecessarily dramatic you are being.  Boyfriend needs to be cautious & maybe end things. You need to work on yourself before your next relationship.", "I agree with you. He was the asshole first. You may or may not have overreacted. I don't see any evidence he is trying to get back with Chloe. But getting drunk and singing songs to ex-girlfriends who are present at the scene is a serious issue and you are not the only one who would be angry.", "So you worried he was singing for her... then proves why he shouldn't be with you?? What do you think he said to his friends when you left?? You think they didn't call you a crazy b for overreacting. You probably even gave her an opportunity to buddy up to him. You really need to think about how you react to things. Those friends aren't going to see you the same for this", "I hope your looking at all the actual REASONABLE comments telling you what an AH you are.", "Youre NOT crazy.\n\nWhat are the chances he specifically sing that song while she is there and its not intentional? Yeah, zero. He never played this song ever, but decided to play when she is there while drunk.\n\nYou need to talk. Serious talk.", "He didn\u2019t do anything wrong he sang a song that he liked OP and you are both reaching saying he\u2019s a asshole for picking that song. You ever been drunk? Most things that come to your head sound like a good idea singing doesn\u2019t affect anyone so dude sang a song", "Have YOU been around drunk people? Tbh when your drunk you tell the truth or express yourself truthfully if you get to that point. Sounds like he was to that point. Also how Ironic that chloe is there and he sings the song. I would be very uncomfortable as well. NTA", "Did he sing it to her or did he sing a song he used to sing to her?", "He could have picked any song. He didn\u2019t. He chose the one he has openly admitted he thinks about his ex to, while his ex was there.", "people trying to justify drunk behavior is wild to me. the song has sentiment towards the ex. the ex was there and so were you. is that the only song he knows? why wouldn\u2019t he play another song? whether he was drunk or sober he still chose to play that song and that\u2019s what bothers me.", "You are dating for a year. There are still lots of random things both of you Will do for the first time, in front of each other.", "No lol. When I'm drunk I spout off on some crazy bullshit. If I'm drunk and decide I want to pretend to watch Rom-Coms on a regular basis, that's what I'll do. I've seen 2 Rom-Coms in my life. The whole 'drunk people tell the truth' trope is such bullshit. Alcohol plays with your emotions, humor, and actions. There's a reason two drunk strangers can declare eternal friendship and then literally never speak again. You ever regret a drunk text? You regret it because it's *not some hidden truth, but a drunken mistake*.", "The song probably popped into his head because he was drunk and she was there.  That's it.", "I think you should break up with him. Spare him having to suffer through your insecurities.", "I wasn't there", "If I was Chloe, I'd be thinking \"this guy used to say that he played this song just for me and apparently it was a lie\", not \"he's singing the song for me\".\nAnd leaving him there, not only was dramatic, but probably made him think that Chloe (who was right there), was a lot less dramatic...\n\nI'm obviously imagining a scenario that didn't happen, but so were you. Next time, since you were sobber, think exactly what your goal is when you behave a certain way. YTA", "No he sang the song he sang to his ex it\u2019s not like OP and him where alone and he sang this song. If you wanna get mad that dude sings a song he knows well and likes go for it I guess", "Because it clicked in the effective one braincell so he sang. That\u2019s it. If he\u2019s getting that drunk though, I probably would have prepaid for an Uber for him and tipped the bartender really well to make sure he got it.", "Save her relationship? \ud83d\ude02 he\u2019s totally gonna break up with her after abandoning him at the party.", "You\u2019re deliberatively missing my point. He sang a song he relates to an ex, in front of said ex and his current girlfriend. And when she verbalised that making her uncomfortable, he told her to go away. Not sure what you\u2019re not understanding, but that isn\u2019t okay.", "You remind me of my ex, and why.\n\nYou need to be single and work through your insecurities so you can go on to maybe have healthy relationships.\n\nYou do not know how to begin to trust.\n\n*YOU* and *YOU* alone wrote *ALL* of the meaning into him playing that song that night. You have no idea why and the only person who might know is him and he was drunk AF apparently so there could be any or no reason.", "Is he dating her now? No? Then stop you're literally going to ruin your relationship doing this bs. Everyone's telling you you're overreacting", "How do you know what he was thinking? Drunk people don\u2019t think, at least not logically.", "I just can't understand how you live your life this way.. ive been with my wife for 11 years.. we married at 19 been married for 7.5 years.. right after we got married she made a mistake.. we were young and still in our party phase.. she was very drunk and she hooked up with our best friend and her boyfriend.. she came home broke down and owned up to it.. 100% took the blame no excuses.. I didn't bat a fuckin eye.. she was my best friend and still is my best friend.. I forgave her.. shit I wasn't even mad at her but I asked her if she wanted an open relationship and after a lot of talking we went with it and have been open ever since. \n\nThis is NOT me suggesting this for you.. I added this as context to further my point.. the worst thing you can do in a relationship is be fuckin jealous.. if your jealous it means you don't trust him.. if you don't trust him you can't fully love him.\n\nHe is definitely NTA here and you definitely were the AH.. but you need to look deep and figure out is the Problem You or Him.. work on yourself, work on your relationship..", "OP admits they are wrong yet you won\u2019t that\u2019s crazy bro. It\u2019s a fucking song it not like he went and fucked her", "For real when I'm drunk I suddenly dont remember anything in my entire life but if my friend is in my field of view I'll be like \"hey remember that time in 5th grade when you told me you only ate ice cream for dinner?\"", "Yup, I can see it now. lol", "Why you so pressed? Speak with some respect. Not sure why you care so much to swear at me lmao. Rude as fuck.", "I\u2019m rude??? And pressed holy fuck reddits on a roll a dude sitting in his car chilling smoking is pressed. Because that\u2019s makes sense dude just admit your reasoning is fucking stupid. The dude liked the song before the EX and OP he\u2019s still going to like it after the EX and OP", "Your logic is actual fucking stupid tho on a real note I never cussed at you I used a cuss word in a sentence never directed towards you then you use one???", "Who on earth are you speaking to like that? Go roll another one my guy, you need it."]}
