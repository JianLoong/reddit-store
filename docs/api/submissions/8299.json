I know the song after listening to it but I didn\u2019t know it before then. \n\nDone with backstory. We were at a small party at our friends apartment on Saturday. He was staying by my place and I drove because I barely drink. It\u2019s the friend group so Chloe is there. No big deal we\u2019ve hungout so so many times all together. My bf is super drunk at this point he\u2019s got the crazy eyes going too. \n\nHe wandered off by himself and sat down at the piano to start playing around. He\u2019s doing this for awhile than all of a sudden starts playing and singing that fucking song. I gave him a look and went over there. I sarcastically said \u201coh trying to cheer Chloe up?\u201d And he just barks \u201cPLEASE LET ME FINISH\u201d I laugh sarcastically and he barks the same thing. \n\nI said f it and grabbed the keys and went home  before he even finished the song. I started getting drunk Texts about ubers being super expensive and he\u2019d have to pay almost 80$ to get to his place after I told him he can\u2019t come to mine. \n\nSince then he has been angry about me leaving him and he keeps switching between he was really drunk and he just likes the song as his defense of his actions.

It's doubtful he was trying to accomplish anything by playing that song, and certainly not consciously. It's kinda understandable that you *could* get upset about that, but we shouldn't pretend our past relationships didn't happen just because they're over. Reminiscing is ok, and people are especially gonna do that while drunk. Your response was a bit out of proportion.", " YTA.   Huge overreaction.  He wasn\u2019t pining or hitting on Chloe in front of you.   He was only singing a song.  It\u2019s just as likely that drunkenly played it cuz he saw her and it popped into his head.  Nothing more, nothing less.   You way overthought this and your insecurity showed.  He apologized.   Now it\u2019s your turn.", "YTA. Your boyfriend likes to sing 80s songs, he got drunk and sang an 80s song. That relates to his ex...how exactly? You seem pretty insecure.", "YTA. I expect such a drama from a 14 years old, but not a grown woman.", "YTA. He loves to sing and he sang a song. He probably used to sing it to the ex because he liked the song (likely sang it before he was with her too). Unless you have some real actual reasons to think he's been secretly pining for chloe for the last 4 years then ffs, it's just a song and he was drunk. You don't tell someone you'll be their sober ride home and ditch them without a REALLY good reason. This is just a dumb thing to put your relationship on the line over (and that's exactly what you've done, whether you realize it or not).", ">I sarcastically said \u201coh trying to cheer Chloe up?\u201d\n\nDid Chloe actually need cheering up, or were you the first you make this about her?\n\n>Edit: if anyone cares the song is **\u201cit might be you\u201d** by Stephen bishop\n\nRead that title a few times until the irony sinks in. \n\nYTA", "YTA because it was such a dramatic reaction. I personally wouldn't tolerate behavior like that, no offense.", "It was just a song. Yes, it might have some connection with an ex, but is he never supposed to sing it ever again? Get over yourself. YTA.\n\nIt might have been the only song he could remember how to play while drunk. \n\nUnless he was making googley eyes at Chloe while he sang it, you over reacted. Insecurity on show.", "YTA and extremely insecure\u2026but what I\u2019m not understanding is that if you\u2019re so certain that he sang this song because he still has feelings for Chloe then why are you with him?", "If I had to eliminate all the songs (and books, TV shows etc) that make me think of the ex I broke up with years ago, the overlap is such that I'd have a mostly empty playlist. YTA. Good music is good music, not a yearning to get back together with someone.", "YTA. That sounds like a gross overreaction on your part. They dated a very short time years ago, & he likes singing all the time? That doesn't sound like he did anything wrong. He was just drunk, & seeing her made him think of a song. I have songs that I think of with old friends & exes, but still liking the song doesn't mean I want to hook up with the person that made me think of the song. That would be ridiculous. \n\nI don't know, maybe after more comments or edits there will be additional info that will change my mind, but as the first commenter, it sounds like you got jealous over nothing & created a huge problem for your boyfriend because you conflated drunk singing with drunk booty calling.", "YTA, it's just a song... is he not allowed to ever listen to or sing it again bc of that one time he sang it to an ex 6 years ago? That's a little odd. \n\nIf it did bother you THAT much, telling him it made you uncomfortable would be a better route than a sarcastic passive-aggressive remark to a drunk person.", "100% YTA. The level of difference between \"he sang a song that idk if he was trying to swoon an ex or not, and I didnt even ask\" and \"the DD ditches your ass at a party\" is pretty huge tbh. This absolutely deserved a discussion, and tbh, if you had actualy said you were leaving if he continued I would be on your side, but to blind side him with 0 ride is an absolutely disproportionate reposnce. I mean, yall even said you are music nerds. Im not gunna stop loving a song just cause of breakup FFS.", "esh", "Oof\u2026I\u2019m leaning that you\u2019re not, but I have questions.

Was he looking at her while singing it (like singing it to her)?", "ESH\n\nHe was a drunk AH.\n\nYou were a sober AH.\n\nThe end.", "YTA. Being drunk makes you do stupid things, but if he likes singing he'd probably start to sing when he's drunk. But you overreacted, especially because they dated for a short amount of time. Just because he sang something about his ex doesn't mean he wants to get back together again.", "Yta obviously", "Nta he was serenading a long ago ex while drunk and now you\u2019re the bad guy? He could have sung literally any other song.", "ESH - you were his DD and you ditched him when got drunk and acted a fool.  He shouldn\u2019t have acted a fool and it sounds like everyone was basically being short and mean to each other.", "YTA. He sang that song to Chloe because he likes singing the song and probably thinks his version is impressive and would delight everyone. He might\u2019ve been drunk enough to deprioritize the connection to Chloe.", "Ah, young dramatic relationships, gotta love em. He was a drunk fool, you got huffy and ditched him. ESH", "Going against the grain here but NTA.\n\nYou know that song is something to them. If my bf sang a song like that linking to an ex I\u2019d be pissed. So I feel you.", "ESH. You should have paid for his ride home since you were his DD, but I'm siding with you here. He drunkenly played that song FOR his ex. He didn't pick it out of the blue for no reason.", "NTA. \n\nDude showed his ass big time, and isn't owning up to any of it.", "I don't get these comments lol. He's at a party with his ex and starts to play the ONE song he used to sing to her in front of everyone..... Like he couldn't play any other song in the universe?\n\nIn my opinion you didn't over react at all. And I would of left him there too. NTA", "Difficult to say. Does he know other songs on piano by heart? Maybe it is just something he played so often that it is his go to song and really meant nothing by it. I\u2019ve played \u201cThe Scientist\u201d by Coldplay for every ex because it\u2019s the only song I\u2019m confident in without a music sheet on piano. Just something to have fun or show off what small talent I have there. \n\nI once had an ex, together six years, who got drunk and did drugs (drugs was a boundary) and I had to drive an hour to pick him up. I still stuck to being his DD. He was drunk enough to cross a boundary we had for years. He was sorry in the end but it ultimately did catalyst other problems that made us no longer compatible. \n\nSo ESH. Can see both ways.", "YTA You completely overreacted. He was drunk and like so many drunk people, they do shit without any deeper meaning behind it.", "NTA. Time to move on. His time is up.", "Oh my god I cannot believe all the people here saying you are in the wrong, you are absolutely NTA here. I would have done the same thing. What comes out when drunk is there when sober. He obviously got all wistful after seeing Chloe and is now mad because he acted like an AH. He's not over her, period. Get you a new man.", "ESH, you shouldn\u2019t have overreacted over a stupid old song that looks like it means nothing here. That being said your boyfriend should get the picture you\u2019re not comfortable with him singing that in this context when you mention it to him. Just my opinion", "NTA. Sounds like he may be a binge drinker. Nothing good comes put of that. I saw plenty of that when I was living in residence at university.", "Look you've been with him a year, you need to have a proper conversation about Chloe, he needs to be honest with you about her. Totally honest.", "23 male is like 15 in maturity.", "ESH but mildly. He was drunk, you were weirded out, he was rude, you left. He probably meant zero by it and you\u2019re overthinking it (just based on your other comments) but drunk yelling isn\u2019t something you need to tolerate. I commented elsewhere and I hope that at least gave you a laugh, but here\u2019s the judgment. Good luck out there.", "YTA, that was a pretty immature overreaction to someone who's drunk. If you were upset you should've just took him home with you and confronted him in the morning. The bad part wasn't that you got mad at him, but the fact that you left him drunk at a party is the low-life part. If he was  \"super drunk\" drunk then luckily he made it home, but just imagine had something happened to him, you would be regretting it forever, for a song he likes and you just supposed it was for that Chloe chick?", "YTA. \n- ASSumed your boyfriend is still pining over some girl he dated 4 years ago.\n- ASSumed your music nerd boyfriend was singing to the girl he dated 4 years ago. \n- agreed to DD your boyfriend, and then left him there drunk without telling him you were leaving. \n\nJealous.

From what you\u2019ve told us (and I will admit I haven\u2019t read all of your responses) he was drunk and therefore not thinking clearly. So my final judgement is ESH. Him for getting drunk and possibly being nostalgic, but regardless inconsiderate. You for agreeing to be the DD and leaving without even talking to him about what he did.\n\nI understand him playing that song with her there hurt you.

Your insecurity is exhausting just reading through the replies.

Having a moment of bad judgment during a party is possibly forgivable (although abandoning him when you\u2019d promised to drive him is possibly annoying enough for him to end things). But doubling down on it after the fact, and insisting that you were right to be jealous over nothing is a massive red flag for him. If he is wise he will end things here. \n\nYou are throwing up many red flags. Not because of what you did at the party (although that was bad), but for still not seeing how irrational & unnecessarily dramatic you are being.  Boyfriend needs to be cautious & maybe end things. You need to work on yourself before your next relationship.", "I agree with you. He was the asshole first. You may or may not have overreacted.

I didn't bat a fuckin eye.. she was my best friend and still is my best friend..

Go roll another one my guy, you need it.", "I think that OPs concern is valid imo. Her bf mentioned he only sings this song to his ex gf. I'm sure it became \"their song\" at one point in time. So when OP was at the party and saw Chloe there then when OPs boyfriend gets to drunk to the point where he wants to play that particular song, I'd be very uncomfortable and want to leave as well. Why couldn't he play any other song? There were other people besides Chloe that were there so why not look at them and think of a song. Instead he sees his ex and plays it. And No one wants to hear their SO playing a song that they used to sing to their ex. ESPECIALLY with them right there. That would be hard and emotions would run wild.

Go google the lyrics. \n\n>And he just barks \u201cPLEASE LET ME FINISH\u201d I laugh sarcastically and he barks the same thing. \n\nHow fkn embarrassing on so many levels.

More so the \"i just like the song\" thing. It was 4 years ago, for less than a year. He's probably over it. Why aren't you?\n\n\nYeah YTA on this one. But the reason being leaving him while he was very intoxicated. Please talk to him about the song and maybe even the thought process he went through to chose it, if it'll ease your mind.

And if someone stops me from singing, I get equally as pissy. Your insecurities are showing girl, it's not a good look whatsoever...", "NTA. Coherent enough to consider his finances in relation to getting an Uber, but performatively obnoxious when being called on to consider your feelings.

I think when we are drunk sometimes repressed feelings come out and maybe that is why it upset you. Also the way he barked at you to fuck off was kinda fucked up. I\u2019d be pissed off too.", "Nta- Knowing the back story to this, there's no denying this was a weird move on his part. It's not your job to babysit this hot-mess of a man, lol. \nDoes he still randomly bring her up?", "I'm gonna get downvoted, but I don't care.\n\nNTA at all. I don't care if he was drunk.

Overall, I think it\u2019s better if you have a sit down with him and have a discussion about how it made you feel. I was in a kinda similar position where music means alot to my bf and kept the playlist he and his ex shared, and he expressed he wanted to keep adding to it to make the ex feel not lonely. I discussed with my bf how I felt and it was resolved. I would suggest the same. If you want to be with bf, I think it\u2019s time to start having discourse about your feelings, insecurities about what had occurred, so you can hopefully feel reassured and secure in your relationship.", "NTA - he needs to stop living in the past. You held him accountable for his stupid behavior.", "NTA.  He\u2019s a grown man.  You didn\u2019t leave him with a group of strangers in a strange city.  He was behaving like an idiot.  Perfectly okay to say nope and leave.", "NTA\nI feel you", "YTA. That could have been dealt with far more reasonably, like a conversation when sober.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA.  His \"Barking\" at you, which I'm interpreting as a possibly loud, clearly annoyed at your interference, comment from him, means he KNEW, even in his drunken state, what he was doing.  And the fact that he continued, in spite of your saying something, means he didn't care what you thought or how you felt.  And I'm sure Chloe feels the same way.  Moreover, once he was \"Sober\" he still hasn't really apologized.  IF he's still stuck on Chloe after 4 years, he's a lost cause.  And the fact that he didn't apologize - saying he's sorry you feel that way is NOT an apology - makes me think he (1) doesn't care how you feel , and (2) doesn't think he did anything wrong.   You may want to evaluate if this relationship is worth it, since he's not willing to see your point of view.", "YTA, seems a bit immature to care so much about him singing a song that wasn't even directed at her. Also childish to storm off and leave him over it. Sounds like a storm in a tea cup because of your own insecurities as it doesn't sound like he flirts with her, mentions her or misses her?\n\nUltimately they were 19 when he sang a song to her. Just kids! Who cares!", "YTA. Immature overreaction on your part.", "I don\u2019t get all the negative responses\u2026 \n**NTA** is what I think. You said he sang a song which was a song dedicated to his ex who was also there. So he \u201chumiliated\u201d you in front of everybody with his action. And we all know actions has consequences. Doesn\u2019t matter that he was drunk because it\u2019s a choice he took to sing through although you talked to him. As a BF he should know better. And at the end he is trying to gaslight you with \u201cI\u2019m sorry **you felt** hurt\u2026\u201d that\u2019s not an apology. \n\nYou need to talk with him. I don\u2019t know your circumstances with him like how long was he single until you both came together or how long you 2 are together - and it doesn\u2019t matter but you need a talk with him about boundaries and stuff if you want this relationship.", "YTA\n\nAnd super insecure. Yes, the song linked to her but do you know how? Let me tell you a little story.\n\nI had an ex. She was incredibly toxic. I got depression, I started self barming. We broke up, I got into therapy. 3 years down the line, I'm still dealing with stuff from that relationship. We had a song, it still reminds me of her and I still occasionally play it. It reminds me that to not overlook the red flags you see in people, despite how much you love them. I think it's supposed to be a love song but it's only bittersweet to me.\n\nMy girlfriend let's me play it as much as I want to. She knows that my ex was, and always will be, a massive part of my life. In some ways positive and some ways negative. Sometimes I just need to listen to that song and process things.\n\nThe point I'm making is that you can't erase someone's past and a song that they have a connection to doesn't instantly mean anything wrong. People process differently, it might mean nothing or it might mean something to your boyfriend. Maybe he just knows that she likes that song and wanted to play it. But you sound incredibly insecure and jealous and you need to accept accept she is a part of his past and it's ok for him to reflect sometimes.", "NTA", "I'm 41. If I stopped singing every song I associate with an ex, I would almost have to stop singing.", "YTA in this situation.  Seems you have one hell of a lot of growing up to do.

And fyi the same song can absolutely be dedicated to more than one person.", "YTA. You totally overreacted, even if he played the song because he saw her there, it\u2019s just a song, it doesn\u2019t mean he suddenly fell in love with her again.

Then the next several articles say quite clearly that alcohol is not a truth serum, and doesn't increase veracity. And that whether someone will be more truthful while drinking is very nuanced.
