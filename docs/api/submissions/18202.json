Shiiiiit, I'd hate to see what you do when you mom forgets to fold your laundry just the way you like it you fuckin edge lord.\n\n2. It was for a skin care product. OP didnt state it was multiple items, just \"a skincare product bought from the same mall my mother went to.\" which makes me believe it was 1 maybe 2 items. Maybe OP can add some more context, like how much their mother spent, are OP's finances limited or are they struggling with debt? If they are they really should be using the credit card for McDonalds even if it is just a little treat.\n\n3. I understand skincare products and makeup can be expensive but I don't think the purchase would be more than, what, $80-$100? Again, if the OP is struggling with debt or has other financial issues where another purchase is going to mess things up big time they shouldn't just hand their credit card out.\n\n4. That is the risk you assume when handing someone your credit card. Family or not anyone can swipe the card and scribble a signature on the receipt paper. the employee isn't going to look at it and go \"Thats not what u/Ok-ratio2100 signature looks like! FRAUD I AM CANCELING THIS TRANSACTION!\"", "Skin care is routinely more than that. I'm bargain conscious, and my skin care almost all costs at least what you've listed (mainly because I developed raging annoying skin issues from COVID masks). Some are $85 for the small bottle. For awhile I used a really expensive lotion (think $240/bottle) to see if it was worth it. Yes, yes it was. I just couldn't justify the cost. So it could easily have been a $120-200 product. Or higher. \n\nI wouldn't jump to calling the cops the first time, either, but I might call the credit card company and let them handle if they're willing.", "$100 dollars is equivalent to my food or transport for a week. Even though could carry loss, I'd be annoyed and hurt if someone i trusted abused that trust. Yes,OP should never have learnt the card but let-s not downplay likely impact.
