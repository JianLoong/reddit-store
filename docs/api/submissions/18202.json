Sounds like you need not to lend your card to your mother again - that's not OK.", "NTA! \"This is how you repay me\"? That was HER choice, when SHE chose to have children. That does NOT equal a \"free pass\" to use your credit card, take things from you or do whatever she wants. Yes, check your statements and accounts. Lock things down with a password. I don't think you're overreacting! ASK your sister how she would feel if \"Mom\" did that with her money! Ugh, protect your finances and financial future!", "Stealing from someone once doesn't make it okay, and her reaction is very suspicious. I definitely wouldn't be lending her the credit card ever again.\n\nNTA", "Nta. Your mom overstepped and made an assumption. She should have asked, but really should have used her own money if she had it or not bothered to get the product.", "It would be one thing if she told you in advance, but the whole \"how did you find out?\" reallllly rubs me the wrong way.\n\nMakes you feel like you have to make sure she doesn't steal something from your bag lol\nNever give her your credit card again.", "NTA\n\nShe had the responsibility as your mother to raise you and cook for you. You don't owe her anything. I would get my card back & tell the bank that is a fraudulent charge.", "Freeze the card and order a replacement. She probably recorded the info and will do this again", "Girl, this wasn\u2019t an impulse purchase. McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t sell moisturizers.\n\nTell the credit card company your card has been lost or compromised and get a new one.", "yes it does matter. she can't borrow or take or buy stuff with your money without telling you. you owe her nothing.", "It's theft, and no, you don't have to \"get over it\".  I'd be distancing myself from both of them.", "lol source?", "I'm in Canada and it was for a phone account, not a credit card (but credit, nonetheless). It would have required me  having to contact him via filing a police report, which I think is what he wanted, so I paid it and moved on.", "Oh, fuck no you are NTA. That's beyond not okay - that's essentially theft!", "NTA", "NTA. If you hadn't checked your bank account, you could've been subjected to many fees for overdrafts and charges for something you didn't even know was charged.\n\nMeanwhile, using your credit card without your permission is stealing, and you would be well within your rights to report her for fraud. She seems very untrustworthy. I wouldn't lend her your card again.", "Absolutely NTA! Her \"how did you find out?\" comment told me everything I need to know. At age 30, I'm finally learning how to stand up to myself and I would fully report this to the cops! Just because she's your mother doesn't mean she can steal from you.", "I think mom could try  if its the debit type  to run it as credit not debit to get around a pin", "This is not a healthy reaction of your mother's. She doesn't have a right to take your stuff and violate your privacy without asking. Her being your mother doesn't make it okay for her to take your stuff, take your money, or come into your room without permission. Please understand how abusive this is.", "Took the words right outta my fingers.", "\"I am your mother\"\nYes, she chose to bring you into this world. Taking care of you, feeding you, keeping you alive were all her legal duties, not a favour.  You'd don't \"owe\" her for doing what she legally had to do. \n\nShe sounds like she is looking for ways to stomp on your boundaries and your autonomy from her. \n\nNTA mom's getting sticky fingers it sounds like.", "NTA. Your mother stole from you. This is theft. Keep checking your transaction history, because with this level of entitlement she probably wrote down your card details", "NTA. This was theft.", "NTA. Cancel your card. Get a new one. Never show it to her. And absolutely never let her use it. With an attitude like that, she's going to use your card again and you may have trouble getting her to pay for it. I am a mother. I have my own credit cards. If I ever did use  My child's credit card it would have to be some sort of an emergency and I would let them know about it right away.\n\nI never let anyone use my credit card, ever. It's a bad idea.  And I also never use anyone else's credit card. I don't want to be accused of charging something that I didn't.", "What your mom did is known as stealing.  You weren't over-reacting.  Never ever give her access to your credit card again, and don't even think about co-signing a loan, being on the same checking or banking account, or any other financial move that she could subvert to her benefit and your detriment.\n\nSimply put, you cannot trust her.\n\nNTA", "Get a new card with a new number right away. She doesn't sound trustworthy and now has a way of abusing that card. You don't want her to ruin your credit already.", "NTA. And yeah, that excuse/cop out about her being your mother and wanting to name everything she was \"supposed\" to do for you (you didn't ask to be born LMAO) is getting really old really fast. Nip that in the bud now! And she takes makeup and things and has a habit of asking how you know? HELL NAW! I have a mother, too, and she respects my things, my money and my credit rating. You're only 20 and if you don't stop her know she'll get worse cuz she's one of those mothers (no offense). She's not even letting you get into adulthood good; she should wait until you're making good money and let you buy her presents. She doesn't respect your space, your things and probably doesn't respect you as a grown up yet so make a plan to move out when you're able...good luck!"]}
