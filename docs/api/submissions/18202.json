OP didnt state it was multiple items, just \"a skincare product bought from the same mall my mother went to.\" which makes me believe it was 1 maybe 2 items.

If they are they really should be using the credit card for McDonalds even if it is just a little treat.\n\n3. I understand skincare products and makeup can be expensive but I don't think the purchase would be more than, what, $80-$100? Again, if the OP is struggling with debt or has other financial issues where another purchase is going to mess things up big time they shouldn't just hand their credit card out.\n\n4.

I'm bargain conscious, and my skin care almost all costs at least what you've listed (mainly because I developed raging annoying skin issues from COVID masks). Some are $85 for the small bottle. For awhile I used a really expensive lotion (think $240/bottle) to see if it was worth it. Yes, yes it was. I just couldn't justify the cost. So it could easily have been a $120-200 product.

I can\u2019t tell you how exhausted I am with the concept that children \u201cowe\u201d their parents. Don\u2019t recall asking to be born. You can be grateful for your parents, sure. But your parents aren\u2019t entitled to use you as some sort of cosmic payback. You don\u2019t owe your mother for her parental care (it\u2019s illegal and considered neglect to NOT care for a child) or food or shelter. \n\nPermission is required \u2014 just like it would be if you used HERS. If she takes issue with the idea that you would use her credit card without permission, I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty telling, and it might be time for some boundaries/distance\u2026\n\n\u201cHow did you find out\u201d is a really odd way to say sorry. Shows she isn\u2019t, and shows her intent is sneaky. She wanted you to never know. That\u2019s stealing, sorry.", "NTA, your mom stole from you.\n\nYou need to report the card as compromised and get one with new numbers, then never let her have it again.\n\nCredit report is probably a good idea too, though if you find other bills/accounts/cards in your name, you have to be ready and willing to report those and press charges.\n\nYou're 20, so it's also time to make sure she doesn't still have access to any of your bank accounts, etc.", "If she didn\u2019t tell you, then you didn\u2019t overreact. NTA.", "Nta get the card back from her and look into your credit report just in case!", "NTA do you not give her access to your money or cards in the future, at all. She cannot be trusted. She knew she was doing something wrong when she said \u201chow did you find out\u201c and it is a big deal. You have every right to be angry. Also, she is your parent, it was her responsibility to do those things for you. You do not owe her any kind of \u201crepayment\u201d", "Why would you give her your credit card? Are you going to let her use it again?", "NTA I think it's time to cut her off from having access to your credit card(s).", "NTA. Don't give her your card again. Even better, report the card as stolen and get a new one. If you ask her to get food for you again, pay he cash or transfer the money to her via Paypal or bank transfer.", "NTA. Cancel the card, have the new one sent to a secure address,  and never give her access.", "I mean\u2026 People have different philosophies on credit cards. \n\nFor example, many people put all their purchases on a CC and pay it off before the interest hits each month. They may do this for rewards, or just because a CC tends to be much more secure than a debit card. \n\nOther people designate a card for one thing \u2014 like gas or groceries \u2014 and use debit for the rest. Ideally, they also pay the CC off before interest hits.\n\nRegular but strategic credit card use can do a lot to help you build credit so you can get a good mortgage, car loan, etc. in the future \u2014 or just a higher credit limit, which not only lowers your credit utilization rate, helping your credit score, but can also be handy in the event of an emergency that your savings might not stretch to cover. Also, credit card rewards can essentially be free money. \n\nK I\u2019ll stop nerding out. \ud83d\ude05 \n\nYour philosophy is fine for a lot of people, but that doesn\u2019t mean the others are wrong.", "Next time, especially if it\u2019s an eye product, tell her you\u2019re looking for it because you\u2019ve developed pink eye and need to throw out said product because it\u2019s been contaminated. \n\nOP, you are definitely NTA. I hate hate HATE it when parents use the \u201cI do all this and this is the thanks I get\u2026\u201d line on their kids. They decided to become parents, and part of that responsibility is to provide the necessities for your kids. Keep your cards secret and secured from now on.", "OP, call your CC provider and change your credit card number. I would be willing to bet that your mom made a note of your number and CVV number (the three-digit code on the back).", "If its that small of an issue than your mom should have no issue paying you back the money she stole.", "Sounds like a great person to go NC with as soon as you can get away. Fuck that.", "Jesus that's cold, how did y'all deal with that? That's a lot of money for a sibling to steal."]}
