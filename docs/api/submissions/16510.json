But because of my parents that regularly steal my money for alcohol and smokes. It's a lot harder to keep everyone from becoming homeless. My parents contribute nothing to the house. and it is just a lot harder to be stable financially with them. plus they're complete assholes to me. I have no idea what they do all day when me and my siblings are at school. I think ill feel very guilty if I did have to do that. bc idk if they'll be able to support themselves. But then again in the back of my head, I'm thinking it's about damn time they have to learn. When I said they're complete assholes to me I mean they yell at me for walking into the same room as them. they wake me up in the middle of the night to tell me how much of a mistake I was. and because of it I've had depression since I was seven. Im going to start telling the side of the story why I think it would be wrong to do. and that's because. My parents have a great relationship with my siblings and I wouldn't want to hurt my siblings.

You are definitely NTA.   \n\nIf i may make a suggestion... Please talk to a counselor or teacher at your school and have them help you call CPS.  They are a mandated reporter and will have to call after you tell them even just the things you've said here (i'm sure there's more).  I think it would be beneficial to have another adult with you when you talk to CPS.   \n\nI hope you get into a better living situation and live a long, happy, healthy life after this!", "Wow, you post is soul crushing. Please know that you are an abused child. Rent and food is not your responsibility, although you sound like an amazing kid. Do you have any adults in your life that you can trust? A teacher or school counselor perhaps? That might be a good starting place.", "NTA. It may be the hardest thing to do but as parents it's suppose to be their responsibility to look after you not the other way around. Your still a kid yourself so your health and safety as well as your siblings should be priority. WHATEVER happens to them is their own doing", "NTA \n\nYou are only 15 and should not be put in that position. Never! You deserve to have a teen life without concerns. I know it's easier said then done but sometimes that's all you need to read or hear to make the right decision. \nChosing for yourself and a better life is a right decision. Not only for you but also for your siblings...", "The term for what they're doing is 'parentification' and its NOT OK. NTA", "NTA. Your parents shouldn't be putting any of that responsibility onto you. It is not your job. They also shouldn't be mentally abusing you like they are. I understand you want what is best for your siblings, but keeping them with your parent's isn't what is best. You need help. Maybe if CPS is involved, and you aren't there to pick up their slack, it might kick them into gear. \n\nTalk to someone at school. Get them to help you. This isn't your responsibility and it is not your fault. I'm so very sorry your parents have let you down like this.", "You are doing GREAT in a very difficult situation. I\u2019m so proud of you. \n\nBut none of this is your problem. Your parents are treating you and your siblings terribly and you need to report this abuse. \n\nFind someone you can talk to. A teacher maybe. Know that life can be much better than this and I hope you and your siblings find that soon. \n\nYour parents I Hope differently.", "OMGoodness. You are so AWESOME in taking on this responsibility. You are the STRONGEST teenager I know. \n\nPlease. Please talk to teacher at school. Tell them exactly what is going on. In fact, don't say a word, show them this post. \n\nYou will be the best brother to your siblings by doing do just this one thing. \n\nI wish you all the best. So very proud of you. You are an angel.", "NTA\n\nIt might be the hardest step now, but in future you'll see it as the best you could have done.\nYou might look for organizations that help young people like you or teachers at your school to help you with everything so you don't have to do this all by yourself.", "NTA obviously but it isn't really just an issue for this sub to judge.  Our verdict doesn't really provide the help you need.", "NTA. If you're anxious about going to CPS straight away, then you can talk to someone at your school such as your favourite teacher or the deputy/ headteacher. Or call a charity that supports children (which one will vary depending on your country.)\n\nThis is a really serious situation that you shouldn't have to deal with. It's great you're reaching out for advice and support, take the next step and access the help available.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There is verbal abuse, sleep depravation and neglect. OP taking care of rent and food and their siblings is just one spot in the long line of things that make this messed up."]}
