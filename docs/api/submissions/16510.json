I recommend as they said here telling someone at school as they should be a mandatory reporter.\n\nI have recently had to make several calls to CPS myself.  It was very stressful.  It did not impact the situation, But at least I felt like I did what I could help it if that makes sense?\n\nSo don't stress about if this is worthy of calling CPS because they have people who are paid to figure that out.

OP, it is not your job to be the responsible \"adult\" in the household when the actual adults - your parents failed and continue to fail being one.

She told me everything was confidential but if it was illegal she needed to report it.  It was a mess and nothing changed except my mother found out it was me and actually made things worse.  I hope your outcome is different, I still think you should try.  I agree that a counselor at school is the best route.  It was terrible to have to continue to live that way for so many years & if you have the chance you should to make it better you should take it.  It is hard to say whether it will be a good thing or not but you have to try.  Even though my situation didn\u2019t work out, I still think you should go through with it instead of continuing as you are.", "I was thinking the same. Good job with what you had to deal with! I don't think many could pull all that off and keep going to school. If you ever feel really down just think, growing up is hard and you already did it. If you can do your parents job and go to school you've already figured out how to do what most adults are still struggling with. You can do anything. You are amazing. Once you can focus on just yourself, you'll win marathons in life, kid. Don't give up. :)", "Truth"]}
