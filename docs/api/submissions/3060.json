My wife and I have a disagreement regarding our one and a half year old son. She thinks **my mom** is a horrid person for not sending him gifts, cards, **asking for pictures**. I think if my mom actually wants no contact\"   \nThis is wayyyy before him OP saying THEY BOTH (not just wife) don't want his mom to have contact with the kid.", "None of us (me and my husband of 25 years) ever left each other in front of others. We always have our backs. All issues are discussed between the two of us alone. In this case they both have their rights. But like I've said calling her a gold digger for nothing she wants or look for for her own gain? It's wrong. Plain and simple.", "Why you saying wife? They both decided on that, due to OP's mother behavior. I'm not saying wife did good (said straight that she should respect OP's word), but this would not be the reason for me to let others insult her and have her husband run away.", "He doesn't know us very well, apparently hates the food, and he wants his mom to come over but she doesn't know us at all and wouldn't want to go to a strangers house", "True that. \n\nHonestly, that solves about 80% of my perceived problems.", "From ops other comments he's ok to go no contact with his mom because she literally wished him dead, and he doesn't talk about his mom.\n\nThe wife needs to get on board though cause she's causing a mess.", "She is cut completely out. I have not seen or spoken to her in a year, but that doesn't mean we have to cut the entire family out", "I mean his wife is a gold digger, let\u2019s not act like she isn\u2019t. His wife sounds honestly like a very toxic person. If everytime this woman is in the room with people and it\u2019s a battle no matter what the situation is, then that person is probably the asshole.\n\nShe sounds awful and like she has ruined OP\u2019s life.", "My wife wasn't even there when we got into the fight. I asked my mom to come to Christmas at our house and when she didn't want to I snapped at her that she was being selfish and should put us first for once in her life. Then she just lost it.", "I dunno.  OP's post talks about how he wants to \"preserve the few relationships [he has] left\" so it seems like the rest of the family doesn't really care for OP and his wife.  Makes you wonder if everyone else is on mom's side, and given OP's account of his wife's behavior in this instance, who was the one being the unreasonable here, OP's mom or his wife?", "Why did his mom say this though? I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t random and was the result of something horrible said by the wife.", "They all know. My grandparents didn't strongly take a side but lean towards my side. They feel she took it way too far, but that I shouldn't have pressured her to give up hosting. My uncle is her twin, they are beyond enmeshed, and he took her side. I really don't have contact with him but he stopped by and we all got roped into an awkward lunch", "You really think asking for gifts for her kid is nothing to do with herself? If she\u2019d stuck to cards, maybe. But the whole point is being no contact. News flash: gifts and cards are contact.", "So your mom wanted to host something at her house that her husband was willing to attend, and you flipped out at her for wanting to do that?  I mean, what were you hoping was going to happen here?", "That doesn't mean anything. I'm the black sheep in my family. When I went no contact with my mom because of the things she did and said to me, in front of my kid, her whole side of the family disowned me. Told me I was garbage and I deserved to be dead. \n\nAnd it's not like they didn't know why I went no contact. My mom threw me out several times as a child and verbally and emotionally abused my sister and I in front of her side of the family. But they're all convinced that the behavior is normal for families and I'm a monster for having boundaries. \n\nAnd it wasn't just me. They went after my spouse even though he had nothing to do with the NC. Texted and emailed him that he was an abuser and a cheater and that they know he'll leave me any day. He's never cheated or abused anyone, they did it just to start shit between us. \n\nSo it's possible it's the wife but you never know with situations like this. Sometimes you're the one the family shits on and if you try to stop it, they don't take it well.", "He claimed in another comment that it was because his wife wanted to host Christmas and his mom wanted to host Christmas. IDK.\n\nIt's still an absolutely EXTREME thing to say to your own child. Unless he started it by saying he wanted her dead, there is absolutely NO reason to tell your child that you wish he had never been born and that an innocent baby is nothing to her.\n\nI can't really think of anything that would make me react like that. I'm sure he's leaving something out, but like...even if his wife did say something, why would you say that to your son?\n\nLike I said, everyone (except for the baby) sounds like they suck.", "I think your situation is totally different.  Presumably, you weren't going around asking family members to still send gifts for you for the holidays after you cut contact with them, right?  Or implying that people were dead? Because that's what OP's wife did here, which is totally just trying to stir up drama.  She got no sympathy points though and got upset about that."]}
