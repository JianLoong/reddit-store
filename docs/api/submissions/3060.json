She will continue to isolate you from your family when she doesn't get her way just like she did in this situation.\n\nJust so you know, your wife is not entitled to host Christmas and force everyone to change their plans just because she wants to do it.", "There always comes a time for passing the torch. It\u2019s also an extremely weird hill to die on. The fact that not only can\u2019t they compromise with rotating but they went no contact over it is just stupid.\n\nIn normal healthy families you just talk and figure out a compromise. Worst case scenario you have two different Holiday dinners with the two hosts. \n\nThe whole refusing to compromise even one inch is toxic as hell. I could never imagine cutting all contact with my child because their wife wanted to host a Holiday dinner. After all that\u2019s them trying to do something nice for the whole family. Spending their money, time and more to provide everyone an enjoyable meal.", "My mom did not historically host it. she only wanted to start hosting when she met her husband a couple years before the blow up."]}
