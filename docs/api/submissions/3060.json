They both decided on that, due to OP's mother behavior.

I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t random and was the result of something horrible said by the wife.", "They all know. My grandparents didn't strongly take a side but lean towards my side. They feel she took it way too far, but that I shouldn't have pressured her to give up hosting. My uncle is her twin, they are beyond enmeshed, and he took her side. I really don't have contact with him but he stopped by and we all got roped into an awkward lunch", "You really think asking for gifts for her kid is nothing to do with herself?

I mean, what were you hoping was going to happen here?", "That doesn't mean anything. I'm the black sheep in my family. When I went no contact with my mom because of the things she did and said to me, in front of my kid, her whole side of the family disowned me. Told me I was garbage and I deserved to be dead. \n\nAnd it's not like they didn't know why I went no contact. My mom threw me out several times as a child and verbally and emotionally abused my sister and I in front of her side of the family. But they're all convinced that the behavior is normal for families and I'm a monster for having boundaries. \n\nAnd it wasn't just me. They went after my spouse even though he had nothing to do with the NC. Texted and emailed him that he was an abuser and a cheater and that they know he'll leave me any day. He's never cheated or abused anyone, they did it just to start shit between us. \n\nSo it's possible it's the wife but you never know with situations like this. Sometimes you're the one the family shits on and if you try to stop it, they don't take it well.", "He claimed in another comment that it was because his wife wanted to host Christmas and his mom wanted to host Christmas. IDK.\n\nIt's still an absolutely EXTREME thing to say to your own child. Unless he started it by saying he wanted her dead, there is absolutely NO reason to tell your child that you wish he had never been born and that an innocent baby is nothing to her.\n\nI can't really think of anything that would make me react like that. I'm sure he's leaving something out, but like...even if his wife did say something, why would you say that to your son?\n\nLike I said, everyone (except for the baby) sounds like they suck.", "I think your situation is totally different.  Presumably, you weren't going around asking family members to still send gifts for you for the holidays after you cut contact with them, right?  Or implying that people were dead?

Your mother is NC .That means, and you all agree, that there is no communication. It seems like your wife would like your mom to initiate contact just so she can have the pleasure of turning her down. That didn't happen. Then the scene with your uncle was totally unnecessary.

Obviously I don\u2019t know her reasoning but that\u2019s what I would be thinking. \nFrom what I have read your mom is the full asshole here for the shit she said to you just cause you wanted her to come to Christmas at your house and have your wife host for once. \nHonestly you both were wrong but you caused more harm then her in that moment because now your mom is going to be laughing at her because her husband didn\u2019t defend her against a Gold digger comment and essentially telling your mom you think your wife is a gold digger so now not only is she humiliated but also probably thinking you think she is a gold digger and that probably hurt her a lot.", "NTA", "This is a pretty common trope on AITA, so if this is real, y'all are toxic.
