I\u2019ve been married just about as long and my wife would be thrilled if I packed the car and figured it out.  This is the definition of creating a mountain out of a molehill.", "NTA. This doesn't seem like the actual issue. Maybe talk to her about it? The things which seem to be bothering her.", "NTA\nThis is an overreaction on your wife's part.  Unless you actually undermine her on a regular basis,  I don't know why she's so upset here. Hopefully you did more than just pack the car ready for the trip.", "INFO - tell us about the prep for getting ready for the road trip , how the rest of getting ready that morning had gone , and the reason for the road trip please", "NTA but please sir, don't turn into my dad, who had to pack and repack and repack and repack the car/boat/truck/whatever until he was satisfied it was the perfect configuration. I just stopped going places with him.", "NTA. Sounds like she\u2019s going through something. Take time as come back to it. You did good!", "   Sounds like your wife is struggling, if she is new to the SAHM game??  \n\n  It can be stressful.  Sounds easy right...clean , watch the kids  and cook  right.   But it is isolating, frustrating,  lonely  and lots of times a thankless job that everyone looks at you like you don't have a job and oh it must be so nice to sit around watching TV all day. (That's not a reality!!).   \n\n  I am sure you work hard all day but make sure your wife is getting adult time with friends and you.  Because it is so difficult to not have an adult conversation all day long.   Make sure you're still helping at home do a load of dishes or laundry, play with the kids for an hour so she can get a hot bath , read or do something to unwind and relax. \n\n Do NOT treat her as if she doesn't have a job!!  Staying at home is so very demanding especially when you have young children.  Some days they will not even allow you a second alone to use the bathroom alone. \n\n  Also you're thinking about the road trip as a vacation and I bet your wife is thinking about how hard it is going to be with the kids while you travel.. changing diapers. Melt down over missed toys and feeding kids while traveling can be problematic.", "NTA.

You saw the problem she was having, and you fixed it. Gods if I could borrow someone when I needed help...", "NTA. But there might be some underlying problems or stress that your wife has and this caused her to lash out. Maybe she is not feeling adequate compared to you since you solved the problem in less that 5 min and she might have spent quite some time with it.

If you are better at packing the car, then you pack the car.", "NTA, and others are right that this wasn\u2019t about the car. Note that baffled feeling and don\u2019t ignore it. You are also right that she shouldn\u2019t take it out on you, and maybe she wasn\u2019t able to hear that. And you were also right not to get into a snit when she reacted out of character. That\u2019s a \u201chey, I love you and I wanted to take this off your plate\u201d kind of moment\u2014and the fact that she couldn\u2019t appreciate it means follow up conversation is important. I hope she realizes and apologizes.", "Ok I'm going to offer a different perspective here. You've come home to 'help', but only arrived at the point where she had already (attempted to) load the car? That's not you coming home to help, that's you coming home after she's already done the entire mental load of figuring out what everybody needs and how much will fit in the car, carrying out all the tasks to get to that point, presumably whilst also parenting. Perhaps also with a car she's not happy with because it's hard to get the pram in on a daily basis, which could leave her feeling stuck. Sure, she could have communicated better, but have a think about how much of this stuff lands on her plate, that you don't even think about.

But also... Maybe a little?\n\nObviously your wife has frustrations about something else, and this is the thing that got the reaction... But I am befuddled by your use of the term \"upstaging\", as if it were a contest?  And it seems like this isn't the first time?  Maybe you inadvertently make things a contest or a game, and your wife doesn't like that?  It seems to me that everyone needs to do some investigating here.", "NTA. Your wife has a skill issue, tell her to git gud", "Nta - ur wife has other issues going on\u2026 probably just over cooked.", "Your wife needs therapy nah", "NTA. Sounds like he hates the tesla? Trying to make a point about it not fitting everything?", "NTA and it sounds like you have in reality 3 kids at home. She has some serious growing up to do.", "She\u2019s being a child! NTA.", "NTA, she is  just over reacting.", "The only thing I really see you being the AH about in this is the \u201c my wife doesn\u2019t work currently, she\u2019s a SAHM\u201d. She\u2019s a SAHM, that\u2019s a huge job. \n\nOtherwise, no NTA for helping out when she got stressed and handling the issue.", "Nta. She sounds tough to please.", "jeez she is an asshole, my other half would have just been happy and moved on lol", "Oh My Friend - At that time, you were not talking to a logical human being, at that moment, what your Wife needed was emotional support... Now I will say this, your wife seems to have issues communicating her needs, and with the Wrecking ball of emotions she dumps it on you, calling you disrespectful.\n\nAnother thing that probably made this situation WORSE, she's most likely called her Close friends, and they have implanted the idea of you being Rude, and Disrespectful towards her.\n\nHer emotional outrage isn't a healthy sign, a lady would have handled her feeling differently, and you know it. \n\nYou were trying to be helpful, and You did fix the problem (as men do). Men want to solve issues, but women can get wrapped up into a Mood or Emotion that will dominate her, until she has some kind of release or closure. \n\nHonestly, she disrespected you and publicly too, this is a problem. \n\nGo to Counselling for her feelings, there's more to this and meets the eye. Could be an issue with some of her friends poisoning her emotions against you. \n\nYou need to be careful what counsellor you go to, the default is to blame You and that's not productive. \n\nThis could lead to divorce, and she will take it all - Emotions trump you, as it was demons tarted by the child like outburst. I would be concerned. \n\nGood Luck, prepare for divorce.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So in her mind she was going to take a walk, calm down, then come back and fix it herself but she came back and you had already fixed it, which she may have interpreted as you thinking she *can't* fix it on her own.", "Im sorry, what? With all due respect this is the stupidest non issue. I personally think i have great spacial awareness & am good at tetris like puzzles. But sometimes it just doesnt click in my brain & i rage quit. Id gone, \"well looks like we are carrying the kids this weekend\"\n\nMy brain went \"oh cool you got it to fit? Awesome. What do you wqnt for dinner?\" when you figured it out. Like who cares which one go it to work. This is a stupid issue. NTA but i hope yall have a good trip", "She has.... issues.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nIf this is how she typically is, that's a problem and I suggest couples counseling.\n\nIf it's a one-off, though, then I'd just let it go.", "NTA, but she is obviously feeling unfulfilled and like she can\u2019t do anything \u201cright\u201d. My wife is a Type A personality but *I* am the Tetris master when it comes to packing/loading/etc and so she leaves it to me and just tries to trust the process.", "NTA but Your wife seems like she is dealing with some issues that u may want to offer help with. My thought would be u solved the problem and made it work which took at least one task off her plate bid appreciate that if i had so much to worry about.", "NTA. If you were bragging, or making fun of her, sure. But just seeing a solution and doing it? No.", "NTA, unless you're leaving some big details out. Some people are better at car Tetris than others. You were calm, said she should walk around the block, and resolved the problem without resorting to AH behavior. Kudos. Traveling with kids can be stressful. You also weren't helping her, you were helping you and your kids get packed on time. \n\nNow, if you told the kids that mom isn't good at packing and undermined her in front of them, or you had an audience of neighbors to show off how much better than her you are - that would be AH behavior.", "NTA. Your wife has problems", "she's cheating. Time for a new wife", "NTA for fixing the issue but did she ask you to fix it or did she just want to vent her frustrations?", "As a woman and I mom, I can only guess as to why she is super stressed out. She was probably in charge of figuring out all of the things she would need, all if the things the kids would need, worrying what would happen if she forgot something. Figuring out if there was a way to buy something if she forgot it. Wondering if you\u2019d yell at her for forgetting something. All while taking care of 2 children as she is a SAHM. All the while, you are in charge of packing your bags and \u2018communal\u2019 things, whatever that means. Snacks, water? Mom\u2019s mental loads are huge, especially when going on breaks. She is probably just really stressed. You\u2019re NTA, but help her out a little bit if she\u2019s about to lose it. Also, don\u2019t ask her what needs done. That\u2019s just more stuff we have to think about. Just think about what needs to be done and do it.", "NTA. It probably did make her feel foolish, but that's on her.", "Shown off to whom? Undermined her in front of what audience?  \n\n\nNTA: the person with no \"pack-fu\" should be happy to sit back and allow the Tetris master do the hard work.", "NTA. She needs help.", "NTA, sounds like she\u2019s stressed about something bigger.\n\nI wonder (total shot in the dark here) if because she stays home and you work, you\u2019re the \u201cfun\u201d parent they look forward to seeing and she\u2019s the \u201cmean\u201d (enforcing rules/making them eat vegetables etc.) parent since she\u2019s with them more? Or because you\u2019re home less, you\u2019re more patient with/have more energy for the kids than her? That dynamic can sometimes emerge, and it\u2019s often not even anyone\u2019s fault. If the kids are seeming like (or even telling her) they like Dad more than Mom, this could be another situation where she feels like you\u2019re the better parent.", "NTA- Marriage is a team sport. Who cares who got the pram into the trunk as long as it is packed and ready to go? People need to let go of their pride and think of the best interest of the entire family.", "Do you constantly fix stuff for her when she is frustrated? Some people don't like being given help unless they ask for it", "We owned a summer house and at the beginning of the season, we would bring 2 cars for all the things that 5 people would need for the season. Dad was an engineer, Mom was a teacher/artist. As a family, we just got in the habit of bringing out all the bags and boxes for Dad because he could make it all fit with room to spare when we couldn't get it all in.\n\nThere's an art to it and you obviously have it. Dad had it. Your wife doesn't and neither did my Mom. In families, you play to people's strengths.\n\nNTA", "NTA but this is not about packing the car.  It\u2019s everything else leading up to it.  Sticking the pram in the car should have been the easy part, once it didnt work that set her off.  Road trips are stressful.", "As a solutions-oriented person myself, NTA. I\u2019ve found that sometimes people aren\u2019t looking to *fix* a problem, or just don\u2019t want the assistance. Sounds to me like there\u2019s a deeper issue at play and the minor frustration of being bested by an inanimate object was a opportunity to vent some emotion.", "Wow, usually I read about men having egos this fragile.  NTA", "Agree. This small thing pushed her over the edge. Why would she use the word \u201cundermined?\u201d", "I was just coming to say... this isn't the only thing. Maybe ask her if there's something else going on, or if she needs a day off from the kids, or like a mom's night out or something. That's not a typical reaction to someone solving a problem for you.", "I bet if it was the husband who reacted that way you'd be screaming for divorce.\n\nShe is a control freak, she didn't like the fact that he fixed it and it made her feel stupid and insignificant because her ego can't comprehend that somebody came up with a solution better than she could so he should have just left it for her to fix according to her.", "\"SAHM is a hard job\"\n\nToo many reddit posts, TikToks, and Instagram have told me this to not believe that's not the right answer.", "Most accurate answer", "Maybe next time he should stay at work. Then when he gets home she'll be pissed he couldn't take time off work to help, she'll still not have the car packed because she couldn't figure it out and he'll still be the one to fix it and she'd still be pissed about it. Take your feminist \"SAHM job is hard\" comics elsewhere.", "Fuck that why should he massage her for being an arsehole, if the gender roles were reversed I bet you'd be calling for divorce", "I read a story where OP packed once and stopped there.  Not sure where you are getting even one repacking out of this", "That\u2019s a big assumption to make about OP\u2019s wife. If my husband did this, my first thought would be \u201cwhat are you actually mad about?\u201d", "Generalizing here but typically women want men to empathize with their situation while men want to solve their problem.", "Because she was feeling overwhelmed. And then you fly in and \u201cfix\u201d what she\u2019d been fighting to fix for a while. She\u2019s most likely frustrated and more mad at herself that she is so overwhelmed she couldn\u2019t find the brain space needed to come up with the solution.\n\nNTA, but next time, if there\u2019s time, wait for her to come back and see if you can tackle it together so she doesn\u2019t feel \u201cuseless\u201d", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80", "So it sounds like your wife has done the planning and 3 times the packing while also having a toddler with her for at least 8 hours a day. Did she have to tell you what things need to be packed for the \u201ccommunal\u201d bags. Did she also need to make sure the house clean before y\u2019all left? Are you also making sure she gets true breaks during the week? Bc it sounds like she has been doing most of the invisible and emotional labor", "My sister always gets stressed and causes a fight with her husband before vacations. It's like she can't resist and everyone knows it will happen.", "Do you guys manage to work in the occasional weekend where you take over the kids and house while your wife escapes? Maybe, if it's feasible for you guys, try to get with her bestie and arrange a weekend escape to decompress?\n\nMy wife and I both work and we have our daughter and all of her activities, sometimes it gets to my wife. When I start to notice she needs a reset I conspire for her with her bestie and try to work out a ladies night.", "yeah, who knew these platforms could be educational?", "To me it honestly sounds like she has issues with control and you took her control away from her and her ego is struggling because you did something better than she did.", "It's a compromise one often makes in a marriage when their partner is clearly projecting or misdirecting frustration that has nothing to do with the person they're blowing up on. All I have is the context the OP offered, and none of it seems to scream that a divorce is necessary. It's kind of odd that you'd make that assumption, and I'm quite curious as to _why_ you would expect that of me? Not angry at you, by any means, but why should I (34M if it helps) want to encourage a woman to divorce her husband if he had a similar outburst within a similar context?\n\nI get what you're saying because I've seen it espoused in literally every thread like this, but that's more an issue of the immature mentality of redditors in regards to relationships, advice, and what constitutes a healthy or toxic relationship. In the same vein as the projections I described above, this attitude seems to stem from a similarly misguided opinion formed from that person's individual traumas or experiences; leading them to think that even the most insignificant indiscretions described in a random AITA post are 1:1 just as bad as the legitimate (or not) abusive things they themselves may have been exposed to - cue the knee jerk \"divorce him/her!\" reactions, and we get the cesspool that is the majority of these comment sections, lol.\n\nIDK if you're hurting from something yourself, but I hope the people around you show you kindness and understanding as you get through it. If I'm off-base with that assessment, I still wish you the best!\n\nEdited: some formatting and typos.", "I mean, do you know with out a shadow of a doubt?  Cause unless you know 1000% I don\u2019t think you can say that\u2019s what he meant or not. I\u2019m just saying it was a poor choice of wording. If my husband said that to me or someone else in passing I would still be bothered by it, words are like daggers. We need to be careful how we use them. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.", "Yeah, seems like there\u2019s something else contributing.", "My husband and I did vacation packing task switches. He about died from just making a list of everything needed. The mental load exhausted him, and we left 5 hours later than planned. He never called someone to come feed the cat, so she went a day and a half without new food. Side note: her bowl was full, but she is a cat, so she acted like we starved her without refreshing it every 8 hours. He also forgot to have the mail held, so we had a few packages stolen after sitting on the front step for a few days.", "Probably hard to do any packing when YOU'RE AT WORK. FFS, dude left work early to come home and help get stuff ready so they could leave in a timely manner and you're pulling the \"SAHM iS a hArD jOB\" card on him. In this particular situation he is NTA, she blew it way out of proportion for whatever reason. \n\nHis wife is lucky she married him because if it were me I'd have pulled all the shit back out of the car and let her repack it all. Yes, I am the asshole when I need to be and I know when I'm being one.", "Is she making sure he did all his work at his job before leaving on vacation? Does she make sure he gets true breaks on this trip?\n\nThey are both adults with functioning mouths, so they can communicate if needed. He doesn't need to treat her like a child and vise versa.", "I\u2019m not saying OP did it maliciously, but wording is important.", "And reading comprehension is also important. You clearly understood what he was trying to say, so why try to make it an issue?", "Why so aggressive lol? If it was my partner and that was wording used about me I would be upset. That\u2019s all, like i said, wording is important. Hope you have a great day!", "Idk, it was early still lol"]}
