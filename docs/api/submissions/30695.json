This means we can wake up tomorrow, shower and all jump in the car to get an early start without having to deal with the hassle of loading the car.\n\n  \nWhile I was inside packing my bag I heard shouting coming from the driveway. When I went outside, I saw my wife shouting at the car and struggling to wedge a pram into the front trunk of our Tesla. She started yelling at me about how it was impossible to fit all of our luggage into the car. I told her to take a 5 min break and go for a walk around the block and come back to take a look.  \n\n  \nAfter she left, I took a look at the problem and realised the pram wouldn\u2019t fit in the frunk (shame because it was almost going to fit except for the handle). I ended up putting the kid\u2019s bags in the front and putting the pram in the back which worked out. \n\n  \nWhen she came back I thought she would be calmer but after she saw that I had managed to Tetris my way into a solution she got upset. She started telling me that I had undermined her and that showing off while she had so much on her plate was an AH move. She said that I should have waited for her to come back and then let her fix it.\n\n  \nI told her that clearly what she was doing wasn\u2019t working and that the problem was fixed so we can move on. I said that while I understood that she was a bit overwhelmed, taking it out on me for helping her wasn\u2019t right.\n\n  \nShe isn\u2019t very happy with me now and I want to know if I am an AH?", "created_utc": 1699598316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ry5dn/aita_for_upstaging_my_wife_when_it_comes_to/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She seems overstressed or something is bothering her and she vented her anger through this.", "huh? she does realise that there would be more people present required for this to qualify as undermining, right?had you been parading in front of others and calling your wife dumb out loud, then i'd get it, but just you two packing up a car? which she was screaming at (lol)?but... is this a character shift or has she been like this throughout your relationship?\n\nedit: NTA obviously", "seems like she is stressed about something", "INFO: Context about her being so obviously stressed out about something?", "NTA. If she's reacting like this over one small thing, I'm guessing there's something else going on where she doesn't feel like she's doing well enough. Could be completely wrong, though.", "NTA.  I\u2019ve been married just about as long and my wife would be thrilled if I packed the car and figured it out.  This is the definition of creating a mountain out of a molehill.", "NTA. This doesn't seem like the actual issue. Maybe talk to her about it? The things which seem to be bothering her.", "NTA\nThis is an overreaction on your wife's part.  Unless you actually undermine her on a regular basis,  I don't know why she's so upset here. Hopefully you did more than just pack the car ready for the trip.", "INFO - tell us about the prep for getting ready for the road trip , how the rest of getting ready that morning had gone , and the reason for the road trip please", "NTA but please sir, don't turn into my dad, who had to pack and repack and repack and repack the car/boat/truck/whatever until he was satisfied it was the perfect configuration. I just stopped going places with him.", "NTA. Sounds like she\u2019s going through something. Take time as come back to it. You did good!", "   Sounds like your wife is struggling, if she is new to the SAHM game??  \n\n  It can be stressful.  Sounds easy right...clean , watch the kids  and cook  right.   But it is isolating, frustrating,  lonely  and lots of times a thankless job that everyone looks at you like you don't have a job and oh it must be so nice to sit around watching TV all day. (That's not a reality!!).   \n\n  I am sure you work hard all day but make sure your wife is getting adult time with friends and you.  Because it is so difficult to not have an adult conversation all day long.   Make sure you're still helping at home do a load of dishes or laundry, play with the kids for an hour so she can get a hot bath , read or do something to unwind and relax. \n\n Do NOT treat her as if she doesn't have a job!!  Staying at home is so very demanding especially when you have young children.  Some days they will not even allow you a second alone to use the bathroom alone. \n\n  Also you're thinking about the road trip as a vacation and I bet your wife is thinking about how hard it is going to be with the kids while you travel.. changing diapers. Melt down over missed toys and feeding kids while traveling can be problematic.", "NTA. My bf is 1000% better than I am at \"tetris-ing the car\" and will gladly let him pack up/let him lead and just help out. Makes the trip that much easier lol", "NTA And she might need a bit of lingo help in the future... Also, by the sounds of it a nap. No shame in being grumpy and just needing a break but she should try not to be snippy at you when you just wanted to help and get it done for her. You saw the problem she was having, and you fixed it. Gods if I could borrow someone when I needed help...", "NTA. But there might be some underlying problems or stress that your wife has and this caused her to lash out. Maybe she is not feeling adequate compared to you since you solved the problem in less that 5 min and she might have spent quite some time with it. You might want to have a sit down and talk to her and see if she is troubled by something and if it's something you can do to help", "NTA.  The best person for the job should do the job.  If you are better at packing the car, then you pack the car.", "NTA, and others are right that this wasn\u2019t about the car. Note that baffled feeling and don\u2019t ignore it. You are also right that she shouldn\u2019t take it out on you, and maybe she wasn\u2019t able to hear that. And you were also right not to get into a snit when she reacted out of character. That\u2019s a \u201chey, I love you and I wanted to take this off your plate\u201d kind of moment\u2014and the fact that she couldn\u2019t appreciate it means follow up conversation is important. I hope she realizes and apologizes.", "Ok I'm going to offer a different perspective here. You've come home to 'help', but only arrived at the point where she had already (attempted to) load the car? That's not you coming home to help, that's you coming home after she's already done the entire mental load of figuring out what everybody needs and how much will fit in the car, carrying out all the tasks to get to that point, presumably whilst also parenting. Perhaps also with a car she's not happy with because it's hard to get the pram in on a daily basis, which could leave her feeling stuck. Sure, she could have communicated better, but have a think about how much of this stuff lands on her plate, that you don't even think about. Maybe read this: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/26/gender-wars-household-chores-comic", "NTA.\n\nThere\u2019s way too many fuckin stories on here of couples being competitive with each other over the most insignificant shit.", "NTA.... But also... Maybe a little?\n\nObviously your wife has frustrations about something else, and this is the thing that got the reaction... But I am befuddled by your use of the term \"upstaging\", as if it were a contest?  And it seems like this isn't the first time?  Maybe you inadvertently make things a contest or a game, and your wife doesn't like that?  It seems to me that everyone needs to do some investigating here.", "NTA. Your wife has a skill issue, tell her to git gud", "Nta - ur wife has other issues going on\u2026 probably just over cooked.", "Your wife needs therapy nah", "NTA. Sounds like he hates the tesla? Trying to make a point about it not fitting everything?", "NTA and it sounds like you have in reality 3 kids at home. She has some serious growing up to do.", "She\u2019s being a child! NTA.", "NTA, she is  just over reacting.", "The only thing I really see you being the AH about in this is the \u201c my wife doesn\u2019t work currently, she\u2019s a SAHM\u201d. She\u2019s a SAHM, that\u2019s a huge job. \n\nOtherwise, no NTA for helping out when she got stressed and handling the issue.", "Nta. She sounds tough to please.", "jeez she is an asshole, my other half would have just been happy and moved on lol", "Oh My Friend - At that time, you were not talking to a logical human being, at that moment, what your Wife needed was emotional support... Now I will say this, your wife seems to have issues communicating her needs, and with the Wrecking ball of emotions she dumps it on you, calling you disrespectful.\n\nAnother thing that probably made this situation WORSE, she's most likely called her Close friends, and they have implanted the idea of you being Rude, and Disrespectful towards her.\n\nHer emotional outrage isn't a healthy sign, a lady would have handled her feeling differently, and you know it. \n\nYou were trying to be helpful, and You did fix the problem (as men do). Men want to solve issues, but women can get wrapped up into a Mood or Emotion that will dominate her, until she has some kind of release or closure. \n\nHonestly, she disrespected you and publicly too, this is a problem. \n\nGo to Counselling for her feelings, there's more to this and meets the eye. Could be an issue with some of her friends poisoning her emotions against you. \n\nYou need to be careful what counsellor you go to, the default is to blame You and that's not productive. \n\nThis could lead to divorce, and she will take it all - Emotions trump you, as it was demons tarted by the child like outburst. I would be concerned. \n\nGood Luck, prepare for divorce.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I pack a lot of stuff beforehand, I get everything towards the car, but he is the one stuffing it all in, because we would need a lot bigger car if I were the one putting stuff in. His brain is wired differently from mine, I guess.\n\nWe have talked about it, me being grumpy because I have all the last bits to pack inside the house, but then, I feel useless when he starts loading the car. We have decided that this is just the way we work, and have decided to roll with it and think of it as \"we're even\". \n\nSame with leaving. I pack most stuff, he loads the car (while I often walk the dog for a pre-journey p&p).

Although since you left work early to help pack you should talk to her about it - not the pram, but why she felt it was only her job to do when you were there to at least help, if not do it. Does she need to be in control? Does she have trouble delegating household jobs to you? Or was it just a once off due to stress?

We also had to stop more because he forgot to pack a snack bag for the kids for the long car ride.\n\nAnd when we came home, the house smelled awful because he didn't take out the trash before we left (\"because it wasn't full\", his words) and he had loaded the dishwasher but not run it.
