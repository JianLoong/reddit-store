That's slipping into divorce territory.", "NTA. She used BOTH of your savings to make a major purchase that will likely change both of your lives and schedules. Purchasing a business is a huge life change that involves careful planning and execution, and still has the potential to incur even more costs and outright fail in the future.

Obviously yelling isn't the ideal way to handle things but I would expect anyone to yell in this situation.\n\nYour wife made a terrible, rash decision that affects you and your child without so much as bringing it up.\n\nAlso Jesus Christ, she thinks she's going to skip from student straight to owning a successful studio? How about try to get a job teaching and build up potential clientele who could follow you to a studio before you dump 2/3 of your savings into something", "NTA. \nYour wife made several *huge* decisions without consulting you. She quit her job. She took a large amount of your shared savings without consulting you.\n\nImo, she was planning to blindside you with this when everything was completed so that you have no choice but to just accept it as fait accompli.\n\nIf this is the first time she's done something like this, I suggest that you try talking it through. But if she has a history of just doing what she wants without consulting you, it means she neither trusts nor respects you.", "NTA!!!! Who makes that type of a financial decision without consulting their spouse especially when it comes to a joint fund account.", "NTA\n\nThis is a betrayal of the highest order.

The time to talk about this was BEFORE making a major life decision with absolutely zero input from her partner, not AFTER", "NTA. I don't understand why people think yelling is inappropriate. The wife deserves a good yelling for taking that much money without talking it through.", ">She then says that I am the asshole for yelling at her instead of talking it through like an adult. \n\nI mean, she didn't talk to you like an adult about taking 2/3's the savings to quit her job and open a yoga studio.

Keep it where she can never access it. Don't contribute anymore to the joint account.

Do not share finances from now on. Your wife cannot be trusted. \n\nThe adult discussion should have been requested by your wife BEFORE the yoga studio was purchased with joint funds.

That yoga studio will be a money pit. Your wife has shown that she is irresponsible and a thief. She's not thinking of your family and didn't talk to you about the studio as an adult.

It\u2019s a joint account and you should knew how/what the money is spent on. However, it\u2019s time to separate finances. Technically 50% is yours, since she\u2019s already used 2/3rd of it, you should keep the rest.

Joint acct= joint decision, but also, job quitting? And business buying? You don\u2019t just buy a business without a lot of consideration and conversation. Also, does your wife even realize reaching yoga is not the same as buying and operating a business?", "If it were a responsible decision, she would have discussed it with you before withdrawing most of your emergency funds.

It's not good to yell at your partner of course, but this is a crazy decision to make without your partner's input and no one can be blamed for getting emotional about it.
