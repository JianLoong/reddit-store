No. Even raising that thought process is an attempt at defending them. No. No. No. This is repulsive.\n\nEdit: give them full accountability without saying \"well I understand they were drunk and their intentions were for a laugh\" then id agree.

Saying \"I mean I get their intentions\" or something is almost like defending them. To put it in another context you could say you understand the intentions of a guy who touches a girl at a bar without consent because hes 1. hormonal 18 year old and 2. she is wearing provocative tight revealing clothing so was \"kinda asking for it\". But you cant say all that saying you understand their interpretation and intentions then say \"oh but its horribly wrong \". Its a huge clash. \n\nYou could raise the argument of \"oh but he was drunk so his judgement is worsened not his fault but kinda is but no\". Its a clear attempt at diffusing what happened and lowering its severity and what harm the stupid boys have done.", "What I'm trying to convey is that he should try to broaden his group of friends to include more compatible people who will respect his boundaries. I took the scenic route there. You're right in informing me that \"dude\" is gender-neutral; I didn't know that. I can kind of see how \"dude\" can be universal.

As respectfully as I can say it, the standards that you and your friends set for your group do not set the standard for everyone else. What is \"too far\" for you is not the same as it will be for others. I feel like most circles of friends would not take a picture of their friends genitals while sleeping, but even if so, they didn't have to get nasty about it when OP expressed his discomfort.
