What kind of a sick joke is that? Nobody wants pictures taken of them without their consent especially if they were naked.

You were also meant to quietly submit to it, because it was a dominance play by your \u201cfriends,\u201d and at least one of them got angry when you did not submit and pushed back, which means you did the absolute right thing. \n\nBecause this is about juvenile dominance games, be prepared that someone hasn\u2019t deleted the picture.

Not because you asked them to remove the picture but for saying to them it was a jerky thing to do after they already removed the picture. It's a bachlor party with friends, you all got wasted and these things happen. You wanted the picture deleted and they did so when you asked. (Btw, I don't know what app it was but for example I have my whatsapp set up to not save pictures on my phone unless I want to)\n\nIf they would post it publicly that would be very wrong, but it stayed in the chat. I've been on weekends/bachlor parties many times where such pictures were taken and with our friends we always trusted that these things stay in the group. And they can be really funny memories to have years later to be honest. It's not like they took a picture of you with a stripper on your lap. \n\nAlso I'm sorry that something as small as this actually \"horrifies\" your wife.", "NTA - Internet and pictures is so different than 15 years ago. If they\u2019re your friends, they shouldn\u2019t take pics of compromising moments -  in good spirit ( or for humor) those pics posted on social media can get people get fired. Put the phone away people!", "your buddies dont have the emotional capacity to just say \"Sorry for making you feel this way.

Case closed.", "Hahaha I would have no problem with that. Hey shit happens, let\u2019s laugh about it\u2026 but I\u2019m 37 and when I was 20 it was a normal thing to do. Hahaha we made some photos in my days!!! Hahaha good times", "How are you victim blaming rn? Would you still say that to him if one of his bachelor buddies decided to assault him while he was passed out? What if the photo went to someone he didn\u2019t know or was posted online? Is it still \u201cbut it\u2019s a bachelors party\u201d!", "You say you're not trying to victim blame, but that is literally what you are doing. Your bear analogy doesn't work, because he wasn't harmed by an animal or act of nature. He was harmed by people who are responsible for their actions.", "For someone not trying to victim blame you\u2019re doing an awfully good job of it. \n\nYeah, dude got blackout drunk, but made it back to his hotel room where he was staying with his friends. Who, presumably, he thought he could trust. Turns out he was wrong and found that out in an extremely hurtful way, that they took advantage of his vulnerable state to make fun of him and take compromising photos of his naked body without his consent. He literally did nothing wrong except befriend the wrong people, which unfortunately isn\u2019t something you can predict.", "Of course my answer would be different if there had been an assault.", "So spreading a naked photo of someone passed out is okay? Where are you drawing the line?", "It wasn\u2019t spread, don\u2019t be so dramatic", "Among drunk friends who most likely attended a bachelor party in Vegas.

Just curious.", "12 friends is a group not a big spread", "I know as much as you know. Spreading is putting it on the internet or sending it to someone whom wasn\u2019t there\u2026. It is always so dramatic with you Americans. Glad I don\u2019t live there and can laugh about this kind of things with friends", "When you're talking about sending a nude picture of someone else, a dozen people is a big spread. Especially considering that once that picture went out, there's a very real chance that one/some of them sent it to another person...and so on. Once it hits the internet, there's no taking it back. OP's \"friends\" are tools.", "Excuse me? I\u2019m not American. You can\u2019t just assume these sorts of things.", "Ok so your just dramatic", "And you have a problem with making assumptions about things. \n\nI never actually said where I came down on the issue, I was just pointing out that your claim presupposed knowledge of the future, which you don\u2019t have.", "NTA, People should be more respectful honestly.", "NTA. What kind of friends do shit like that? Not good ones.", "It's only a joke  when your not the victim (couldn't think of a better word).  If it was them, they would be losing their minds.", "NTA.\n\n> I should probably mention the guy that took the photo had deleted it but it had been sent into a groupchat where it automatically saves to your camera roll so everyone else had it as well.\n\nIn what world is distributing non-consensually obtained naked photos not a serious issue? Your friends are assholes. You could probably go after them legally for this (depending on country), but it doesn't sound like you'd want to. I'm only mentioning this to give you an idea of how awful their actions are.", "> the guy that took the photo had deleted it but it had been sent into a groupchat\n\nI am 99% sure that is against the law. Like taking that photo, then also sharing it, without your consent. This is not cool - and plus what ever happened to the phrase: \"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas?\".. capturing indecent pictures of your 'friends' is a really awful thing to do.. let alone sharing it.. gross.  \n\n\nNTA.", "Obviously NTA. I\u2019m so so sorry this happened to you", "Haha ESH . Ok ask them to delete then move on.", "This is one of those things where Reddit will get on their high horse and say you\u2019ve been a victim of blah blah blah, but you passed out in a hotel room you shared with other people, on a bachelor party, with your cock and balls in full view. That picture should live forever as a testament to your inability to keep your shit together.  YTA for telling your wife and you know it", "NTA.\n\nI think it's just a harmless and playful picture. It's not rare for friends to do this to other friends. I would not have been mad about it. I'm assuming you are not a long-term friend with these guys? Because if you were close with them, you would not have been so  serious about it. \n   \n    With that being said,  since you are not close enough to them, they never should have done something that only close friends do. You won't see it through their eyes. They should have deleted it immediately upon your request. This is why I am saying that you are not a asshole. They needed to respect your feelings and the fact that you are not a established friend in the group.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, it's horrific when naked photographs of other people are taken against their consent. It doesn't matter if you're friends. If you want a photo like that you can ask for permission before taking it.

Definitely won't be drinking again.", "Why shouldn't I have told my wife ?", "We are close friends. Been friends for years. Still think it's weird", "You made a fool of yourself, your friends ribbed you for it. End of story. Then you involved your wife and it gets blown out of proportion, she won\u2019t be able to look at your friends the same.
