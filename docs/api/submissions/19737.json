Anyway once I got back to the room I must have passed out on my bed midway through getting changed because I had my nightshirt on but no bottoms. The next day at breakfast one of my friends showed me a selfie he had taken with the other guys in my room. I was in the background passed out and naked. I was kind of uncomfortable and embarrassed so I told them to delete the photo and left it at that. When I got back and told my wife about the photo she was horrified and said it was a really disrespectful thing to do. I was quite upset about it so I messaged the guys and basically said to make sure everyone had deleted the photo and explained that I thought it was kind of a jerky thing to do. One of the guys said he had deleted the photo but I was being dramatic and it was just a joke. I don't know if I'm overreacting but I feel really uncomfortable about the whole thing and the guys are pissed I called them out.\n\nedit: I should probably mention the guy that took the photo had deleted it but it had been sent into a groupchat where it automatically saves to your camera roll so everyone else had it as well. That's why I messaged everyone again asking them to delete.

What kind of a sick joke is that? Nobody wants pictures taken of them without their consent especially if they were naked. My friends and I are all girls and we\u2019ve seen each other naked before but I would never in a million years think about taking a picture of them while they were passed out naked\u2026 I\u2019m even more shocked that your \u201cfriend\u201d actually SENT the photo to the whole group!

What other reason is there to take a picture of someone who is passed out and naked other than to humiliate them? Of *course* you are upset by it. You were meant to be! You were also meant to quietly submit to it, because it was a dominance play by your \u201cfriends,\u201d and at least one of them got angry when you did not submit and pushed back, which means you did the absolute right thing. \n\nBecause this is about juvenile dominance games, be prepared that someone hasn\u2019t deleted the picture.

Lesson learned.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re within your right to have the photo deleted.\nIt is understandable you\u2019d be uncomfortable.\nI can see a lot of my guy friends doing this as a joke and not out of malice.", "NTA this is not something a friend does", "Soft YTA. Not because you asked them to remove the picture but for saying to them it was a jerky thing to do after they already removed the picture. It's a bachlor party with friends, you all got wasted and these things happen. You wanted the picture deleted and they did so when you asked. (Btw, I don't know what app it was but for example I have my whatsapp set up to not save pictures on my phone unless I want to)\n\nIf they would post it publicly that would be very wrong, but it stayed in the chat. I've been on weekends/bachlor parties many times where such pictures were taken and with our friends we always trusted that these things stay in the group. And they can be really funny memories to have years later to be honest. It's not like they took a picture of you with a stripper on your lap. \n\nAlso I'm sorry that something as small as this actually \"horrifies\" your wife.", "NTA - Internet and pictures is so different than 15 years ago. If they\u2019re your friends, they shouldn\u2019t take pics of compromising moments -  in good spirit ( or for humor) those pics posted on social media can get people get fired. Put the phone away people!", "your buddies dont have the emotional capacity to just say \"Sorry for making you feel this way. Our fun at the expense of your humiliation isnt cool sorry.\" so instead the put the onus on you. These guys are AHs, and I hope you find friends who are real men who know how to take accountability.\n\nNTA", "If the photo was deleted as requested, that\u2019s the end of it. No one needs to be an AH in this situation, you passed out half naked at a party, they took pictures. You felt embarrassed, you asked for deletion, and as far as you know its been deleted. Case closed.", "Hahaha I would have no problem with that. Hey shit happens, let\u2019s laugh about it\u2026 but I\u2019m 37 and when I was 20 it was a normal thing to do. Hahaha we made some photos in my days!!! Hahaha good times", "How are you victim blaming rn? Would you still say that to him if one of his bachelor buddies decided to assault him while he was passed out? What if the photo went to someone he didn\u2019t know or was posted online? Is it still \u201cbut it\u2019s a bachelors party\u201d!", "You say you're not trying to victim blame, but that is literally what you are doing. Your bear analogy doesn't work, because he wasn't harmed by an animal or act of nature. He was harmed by people who are responsible for their actions.", "For someone not trying to victim blame you\u2019re doing an awfully good job of it. \n\nYeah, dude got blackout drunk, but made it back to his hotel room where he was staying with his friends. Who, presumably, he thought he could trust. Turns out he was wrong and found that out in an extremely hurtful way, that they took advantage of his vulnerable state to make fun of him and take compromising photos of his naked body without his consent. He literally did nothing wrong except befriend the wrong people, which unfortunately isn\u2019t something you can predict.", "Of course my answer would be different if there had been an assault.", "So spreading a naked photo of someone passed out is okay? Where are you drawing the line?", "It wasn\u2019t spread, don\u2019t be so dramatic", "Among drunk friends who most likely attended a bachelor party in Vegas. They deleted it.", "12 people is a pretty big \"spread\".", "It wasn\u2019t spread yet. You happen to know for certain that all his friends deleted it and it won\u2019t break containment? Just curious.", "12 friends is a group not a big spread", "I know as much as you know. Spreading is putting it on the internet or sending it to someone whom wasn\u2019t there\u2026. It is always so dramatic with you Americans. Glad I don\u2019t live there and can laugh about this kind of things with friends", "When you're talking about sending a nude picture of someone else, a dozen people is a big spread. Especially considering that once that picture went out, there's a very real chance that one/some of them sent it to another person...and so on. Once it hits the internet, there's no taking it back. OP's \"friends\" are tools.", "Excuse me? I\u2019m not American. You can\u2019t just assume these sorts of things.", "Ok so your just dramatic", "And you have a problem with making assumptions about things. \n\nI never actually said where I came down on the issue, I was just pointing out that your claim presupposed knowledge of the future, which you don\u2019t have."]}
