When we were dating we used to always go out to where he wanted to go. I never bothered to tell him where I wanted to go because I didn't want to bother him. Our interest in things are very different. He likes to go hiking, rides bike and goes to the beach. I on the other hand enjoy operas, musicals and plays. He's made it very known that he thinks that what I like is boring. He's never blatantly said anything bad about my interest so I've never said anything. A few days ago, he asked me what we should do this weekend since he was in the mood for going out. I told him that I wanted to go to a piano recital that would be happening that weekend.\n\nHe got upset and told me that he didn't want to sit in a theater for two hours with \"boring\" music. I felt upset that he didn't want to go so I asked him where he wanted to go. He said that he wanted to go to a club that had recently opened. I had something happen at a club once so he knows that I'm not comfortable going. When I asked him why he would even think about asking me that, he said \"I just wanna go somewhere fun .\" I felt annoyed and slept in the guest room since I didn't feel like seeing him. Two days later, I bought a ticket to the theater. \n\nThat night I was getting dressed and he asked me where I was going. I told him that I was going to the theater. He got upset and said \"why would you do that when you know I don't wanna go? Now you're going to force me to sit in some dumb theater?\" I replied \"You won't have to sit in a dumb theater because I didn't by you a ticket.\" He seemed stunned that I had said that. We had a huge fight with him insisting that I go to the club but I was firm. The musical was one of the best ones I've ever been to and was beautiful. When I got home, my phone immediately blew up with messages and missed calls.\n\n (I had turned off my phone during the recital) My husband was texting me that I was selfish for leaving. My MIL had messaged me as well saying that it wasn't fair that I got to go out while he stayed home all by himself. My parents agreed with him saying that I shouldn't have gone out without him. I think that what I did was right. This is the first time I've done something that I liked in all of our time together. I don't think I'm the AH but lots of people do which is why I'm questioning. Now I'm starting to feel like an AH. I feel like I could've taken him and sucked up a few remarks from him. I feel like the AH but some of my friends told me not go give in.

You don\u2019t have to like every single thing that your spouse does, you just have to let them enjoy what they enjoy. He\u2019s not a fucking child, he can stay home for a night if he\u2019s not interested in what you\u2019re doing. Good for you for not letting him hold you back", "NTA.\n\nHe could've gone to the club himself if he really wanted to? How about you guys just do separate things that the other doesn't want to do sometimes and then a date night somewhere you both want to go?", "NTA, and your husband sounds emotionally abusive and selfish.", "NTA, what world do you live in where both of your families are saying you shouldn't go out without your husband??? People have different interests and that's okay!", "NTA, but genuine question: wtf did you marry someone you, on first glance, absolutely have no common interests with?", "NTA - Being married doesn't mean you don't get to have your own life or your own interests.  He's TA for the obvious reasons, but also for running to Mommy and Daddy with his marital issues instead of dealing with them like an adult.\n\nGood for you.  Go more places on your own or with friends who share your interests.", "NTA - He is grown. There is no reason why he couldn\u2019t go out without you. You have compromised *for years* by doing what he wanted, and he couldn\u2019t do that for you *once* without throwing a tantrum. If he doesn\u2019t want to do what you like *with you,* then it\u2019s only natural that you will do what you like *without him.*\n\nMarriage doesn\u2019t mean being joined at the hip, or one having to sacrifice their interests while the other always gets their way. This sounds like a deep-rooted issue that\u2019ll need to be worked on to help your marriage. You did amazing by standing up for yourself and giving yourself the gift of a fun night (if he won\u2019t do that for you, absolutely do it for yourself!).

I don\u2019t really like bowling, but my bf loves it! So we go bowling every so often but he\u2019ll go by himself as well. I like movie theatre\u2019s, he doesn\u2019t, I usually go by myself or with friends. You guys are married, not attached to the hip!", "NTA. Good for you! You've been doing it his way for years. You didn't insist he accompany you to a \"boring\" recital, so he was free to do what he wanted. I guess he wanted to complain to his Mommy.

I do hope your communication on this topic gets better, though.You should have spoken up sooner about the need to compromise on activities.", "NTA  \nYou shouldn't have to give up everything/anything you enjoy just because he doesn't enjoy those activities.  It cuts you off from new experiences and forces you both to give up activities you already know you like.   \nMarriage doesn't mean you're attached at the hip.

He sounds very controlling, and it\u2019s really sketchy that he complained to his mommy that he was all alone. If you have differing interests, a true partnership is either participating in what your partner likes without complaining about it, or politely declining (or suggesting the other partner take a friend).\n\nI\u2019m honestly wondering how you ended up together, shared interests are crucial to a good relationship, IMO. I worry that you have been forced to suppress your own needs in this marriage.", "Nta at all. You should've done this years ago. \n\nIf my partner goes to watch the ufc on the weekends, I go to the beach and read. \n\nIf he goes to a BBQ with his friends on a Friday night and I don't want to go, I go watch the stars or hang out with my friends. \n\nYou're allowed to do separate things.\n\nI don't know why you'd be with someone who can't even feign interest in your interests and compromise once in awhile but thats your business...", "NTA but holy hell, why have you put up with this for so long?  You are a human being and entitled to enjoy and attend events that you want to.  If he doesn't want to go, or can't sit through them for you without complaining, you absolutely should go on your own, or with friends.  \n\nI really applaud you for buying yourself that ticket and having a wonderful time - a lot of people would just cave under the pressure.  I'm curious if this experience will become a real eye opener in your marriage though, because him harassing you, and getting your MIL to harass you, is a bad sign.", "Fuck no you\u2019re not the AH", "NTA.

And you can't be the ONLY one who compromises.", "NTA  It's fine for you to have different interests and you don't need to be tied together all the time.

You are allowed to have interests and hobbies of your own, and you don't have to do everything with your husband. Does he have friends of his own that he can do things with? Tell him that he's welcome to spend time with them occasionally, just as you can go out with your friends. It's healthy and productive to have separate interests.\n\nBottom line, you've done nothing wrong. Hopefully your husband can learn to be open minded and compromising. Otherwise you're just going to become resentful of him and your marriage.", "This is an abusive marriage.  It is perfectly fine for couples to do different things.

Also, it's ok for partners to sometimes do things individually.\n\nYour SO and both families are kinda AH, though, your husband for never compromising and both families for trying to force you to submit when they probably don't know he always get his way.", "ESH, OP, you indicate, When we were dating we used to always go out to where he wanted to go. I never bothered to tell him where I wanted to go because I didn't want to bother him.\" sounds like you didn't let him see your authentic self.\n\nI don't believe couples have to have the same interests in order to order to be compatible. It's fine you have other interests and fine that each do then separately. However, how you went about this was passive aggressive and his reaction was over the top.

He needs to figure out how to adult, and understand that you have differing interests.  And the solution to that cannot be that you, as a couple, always do what he wants or a tantrum ensues.

Yes, sometimes when things are going very wrong you want to get the input (not direction) of others, sometimes to include parents.  But you are never as a couple going to learn the arts of compromise and mutual support if you are mommied and daddied with every conflict.\n\nEdit - never or infrequently really bringing this issue with him also contributed to the issue - especially if this is one-sided way to determine activities is something he now assumes is okay because it's always been that way.

She is now overseas. \n\nI have no idea where she is at times during the week though I am confident she is out doing good works for others whereas I'd rather she spend more time on herself.\n\nSo for starters, advise gently, or in other words, outside parties to mind their own business. Be crystal clear on that and what that means to you without cutting off pathways that may bring helpful advice.\n\nNext - don't take a winners/losers mindset. Objective is no losers.\n\nSit down with ~~dummy~~ Hubby and have a rules based discussion. \n\nRules are only in place to assist have a good conversation. For example... listening without interruption, no dummy spits, understanding/exploring positions (with a few open ended questions), visualising what options could exist. \n\nKind of like working together so you can both be happy.\n\nDon't feel like an AH - that's a slippery slope. The hard part is that you need to be the adult in the room.\n\nTormenting a quote I heard once... you need to tell him to go to hell in a way that he is looking forward to the journey.\n\nActually, managed well, you'll both come through feeling really good about things and you'll be rolling your eyeballs as he takes credit.", "NTA. You're married not conjoined twins. You don't have to do everything together all the time. Each of you is allowed and should have your own interests. FYI, you didn't leave your husband to sit at home by himself. He could've gone out as well. He chose not to. Bringing mommy into it because he didn't get his way, really? Smh.", "NTA. Mate this is not a healthy relationship. Not daring for your trauma and trying to force you to go somewhere he knows cause you discomfort is not the actions of a kind, caring or loving partner. Then he sends in his flying monkeys to prove him \u201cright\u201d. Who the fuck are these people? The fact you have never done something you love because your self absorbed husband always has to have his way speaks volumes. Shake on his mother for pandering to him and I won\u2019t even get started on your parents. OP, you deserve better, that\u2019s not a partnership. Imagine the fun you\u2019ll have not being tied down to an almost 40 year old tantrum throwing toddler.", "Sheeeeesh. Last summer I wanted to go to the Cirque du Soleil but it\u2019s so not my husbands cup of tea. So I took my best friend and had the time of my life. My husband stayed home, played nintendo and drank beer. We both had a great night. You can do that apart from your spouse, and you SHOULD from time to time. NTA but please stick up for yourself girl!", "It is 100% normal to do things by yourself without your spouse. My partner and I both recognize there are some interests each of us has that the other is indifferent to, so we don't suffer each other through them. We have plenty of mutual interests that we do to spend time with each other, but we rarely ever stop the other from going to an event one of us has no interest in unless it impacts plans we've already made together.\n\nWhy is he mad that you want to go do something you like, and that he has zero interest in, without him, and why are his parents and yours both seemingly in agreement with him? It's normal for couples to spend time apart and do things separately from one another, and he didn't have to stay home, he could have gone to the club you don't want to go to, while you go to the concert he doesn't want to go to. Seems pretty win-win to me, tbh.\n\nETA verdict: you're NTA, your husband and your and his parents are, though.", "NTA.\n\nEven if interests are different,  spouses/partners  should support  each other's healthy  interests. \n\nImagine if/when you two have a child and that child enjoys your interests and not your husband's. Will your  husband  shit on his kid's interests too?", "NTA - Seems as if he thinks that marriage is all about what he wants.  Maybe you two can do some marriage counseling.", "NTA. I've been with my partner 10 years. Every Friday night and most of Saturday he goes and does his own thing while most of Friday and every Sat night I do my own thing. It's great.", "Man you screwed up. ESH for not realizing such obvious differences in personality before marriage", "I think the communication in your relationship is abysmal. \n\nTo the very specific question of are you TA for going out without your husband - no NTA. \n\nYou are however and AH for how you handled the whole situation. Your husband might *also* be an AH but it\u2019s hard to tell. Since you handled the issue so incredibly poorly, it\u2019s hard to know how he would have acted if you just had a conversation with him about how you feel. \n\nI suspect he might not have listened, at which point he\u2019d be TA, but at least then you guys would be fighting about the right thing. If you want your marriage to last you need to talk to each other, and let your husband know how you actually feel. If you love each other I am sure there are many compromises that can be made, but not if you don\u2019t actually know what each other even wants or how each other feels.", "NTA. Maybe you could have told him you bought yourself a ticket and he was free to do whatever he wanted. But he's a grown up apparently, he can handle a night alone.", "NTA.", "Wow. I'm stunned that people took his side- NTA AT ALL!!! Why are you expected to have to be by his side all the time? He is a grown man, not a child! What does he expect when he knowingly shuts you down when you've expressed what you want to do? In all your years of being together not once has he let you do what you want, and now he's angry you finally did something for you? \n\nI don't feel super comfortable speaking on your relationship especially because you guys are married but I can tell you right now that if my husband ever treated me like that, he would be seeing the door. And it would stay locked behind him.", "How are the parents involved in this?? Had to go back and check the age again.", "But it's more than that. He didn't want to go to her outing of choice. Great that's fine. But he insists that she go with him to his, despite knowing that clubs are uncomfortable for her due to past experiences. And he's made his opinion clear as to her preferred entertainment choices. So much so that she just doesn't bring them up anymore because she doesn't want to be a bother? And when she does finally do something for herself, everyone piles in on how awful of her to do that? \n\nI think people in OP's life have gotten so used to her quiet acceptance that any deviation in unacceptable. I don't know just how you fix that, even with therapy. That sort of rewriting the status quo is usually pretty damned difficult.", "He wants a little meat puppet.  Someone who wants to do what he wants always and who he doesn\u2019t have to consider, because she just goes along with whatever he says. \n\nHe\u2019s not mad she went by herself. He\u2019s mad she\u2019s being her own person.", "Not trying to be condescending but I\u2019m proud of you! You are doing a really amazing important thing for yourself. I hope he is able to get his act together too but just know that even if he doesn\u2019t. You will be ok without him.", "Couples counseling is a great step! Not sure if you've looked at therapists but you might want to consider avoiding religious based counseling. It sounded from your other comment that religion has influenced how you approach your marriage and it could be good to get a more neutral professional perspective", "He doesn't have any friends of his own.  When would he have a chance to make his own friends, if he can't leave the house without OP?", "Most likely, her parents think she's selfish because her husband lied to them about what actually happened.", "Yeah. That's hot /s", "I don't think they have kids cause who has the energy to go clubbing at 38 when they have kids?", "Not sad! I\u2019ve gone to musicals alone. A little awkward when I cry by myself but whatever lol.", "I love roller skating and my fianc\u00e9 likes to game during this time. roller skating clears my head and de stresses me.", "That sounds like a him problem.\n\nDoesn't he have any friends he can get together with, if he doesn't want to be alone?  If he doesn't have any friends, that's a him problem, too.", "Why do you think OP always put her wants and interests last, and let him have his way all the time?  That's what her parents taught her to do.\n\nEdit:  OP in the comments explains that her parents' religion teaches that women should be subservient to men, so yes, she was brought up to believe that.", "lol Yep, and, no surprise here - he called his mommy about this.", "And it\u2019s definitely not okay for a grown man to call mommy and MIL to tattle on their wife. What a AH.", "Haha, ok fair point!", "If you have a relationship where one person always goes along meekly with the other, that's not good. If the meek person (OP) eventually starts to stand up for themselves as an independent person, of course the controlling person is going to throw a fit. OP should continue standing up for herself and end the marriage if he wont' respect her.", "I bet he doesn't have any friends of his own.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Came to post this.", "I agree. That's why I support OP going out to hear music.", "This is manipulative and controlling on his part.", "I just saw this play out w/ some friends (well, only one of them is my friend now that the dust has settled) so it gets me up in arms. My friend just went along w/ her ex-husband for about 4 yrs, but then wanted to pursue their own interests and not just be his little puppet, and that's when the emotional abuse really escalated.", "So it's a tricky time for OP. How her husband reacts to her outings with be key."]}
