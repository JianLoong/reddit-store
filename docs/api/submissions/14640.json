When we were dating we used to always go out to where he wanted to go. I never bothered to tell him where I wanted to go because I didn't want to bother him. Our interest in things are very different. He likes to go hiking, rides bike and goes to the beach. I on the other hand enjoy operas, musicals and plays. He's made it very known that he thinks that what I like is boring. He's never blatantly said anything bad about my interest so I've never said anything. A few days ago, he asked me what we should do this weekend since he was in the mood for going out. I told him that I wanted to go to a piano recital that would be happening that weekend.\n\nHe got upset and told me that he didn't want to sit in a theater for two hours with \"boring\" music. I felt upset that he didn't want to go so I asked him where he wanted to go. He said that he wanted to go to a club that had recently opened. I had something happen at a club once so he knows that I'm not comfortable going. When I asked him why he would even think about asking me that, he said \"I just wanna go somewhere fun .\" I felt annoyed and slept in the guest room since I didn't feel like seeing him. Two days later, I bought a ticket to the theater. \n\nThat night I was getting dressed and he asked me where I was going. I told him that I was going to the theater. He got upset and said \"why would you do that when you know I don't wanna go? Now you're going to force me to sit in some dumb theater?\" I replied \"You won't have to sit in a dumb theater because I didn't by you a ticket.\" He seemed stunned that I had said that. We had a huge fight with him insisting that I go to the club but I was firm. The musical was one of the best ones I've ever been to and was beautiful. When I got home, my phone immediately blew up with messages and missed calls.\n\n (I had turned off my phone during the recital) My husband was texting me that I was selfish for leaving. My MIL had messaged me as well saying that it wasn't fair that I got to go out while he stayed home all by himself. My parents agreed with him saying that I shouldn't have gone out without him. I think that what I did was right. This is the first time I've done something that I liked in all of our time together. I don't think I'm the AH but lots of people do which is why I'm questioning. Now I'm starting to feel like an AH. I feel like I could've taken him and sucked up a few remarks from him. I feel like the AH but some of my friends told me not go give in.

You don\u2019t have to like every single thing that your spouse does, you just have to let them enjoy what they enjoy. He\u2019s not a fucking child, he can stay home for a night if he\u2019s not interested in what you\u2019re doing. Good for you for not letting him hold you back", "NTA.\n\nHe could've gone to the club himself if he really wanted to? How about you guys just do separate things that the other doesn't want to do sometimes and then a date night somewhere you both want to go?", "NTA, and your husband sounds emotionally abusive and selfish.", "NTA, what world do you live in where both of your families are saying you shouldn't go out without your husband??? People have different interests and that's okay!", "NTA, but genuine question: wtf did you marry someone you, on first glance, absolutely have no common interests with?", "NTA - Being married doesn't mean you don't get to have your own life or your own interests.  He's TA for the obvious reasons, but also for running to Mommy and Daddy with his marital issues instead of dealing with them like an adult.\n\nGood for you.  Go more places on your own or with friends who share your interests.", "NTA - He is grown. There is no reason why he couldn\u2019t go out without you. You have compromised *for years* by doing what he wanted, and he couldn\u2019t do that for you *once* without throwing a tantrum. If he doesn\u2019t want to do what you like *with you,* then it\u2019s only natural that you will do what you like *without him.*\n\nMarriage doesn\u2019t mean being joined at the hip, or one having to sacrifice their interests while the other always gets their way. This sounds like a deep-rooted issue that\u2019ll need to be worked on to help your marriage. You did amazing by standing up for yourself and giving yourself the gift of a fun night (if he won\u2019t do that for you, absolutely do it for yourself!).

I like movie theatre\u2019s, he doesn\u2019t, I usually go by myself or with friends. You guys are married, not attached to the hip!", "NTA. Good for you! You've been doing it his way for years. You didn't insist he accompany you to a \"boring\" recital, so he was free to do what he wanted. I guess he wanted to complain to his Mommy.

I do hope your communication on this topic gets better, though.You should have spoken up sooner about the need to compromise on activities.", "NTA  \nYou shouldn't have to give up everything/anything you enjoy just because he doesn't enjoy those activities.  It cuts you off from new experiences and forces you both to give up activities you already know you like.   \nMarriage doesn't mean you're attached at the hip.

That is NOT normal to do everything with your partner. Don\u2019t you guys have other friends? NTA.", "NTA.

He sounds very controlling, and it\u2019s really sketchy that he complained to his mommy that he was all alone. If you have differing interests, a true partnership is either participating in what your partner likes without complaining about it, or politely declining (or suggesting the other partner take a friend).\n\nI\u2019m honestly wondering how you ended up together, shared interests are crucial to a good relationship, IMO. I worry that you have been forced to suppress your own needs in this marriage.", "Nta at all. You should've done this years ago. \n\nIf my partner goes to watch the ufc on the weekends, I go to the beach and read. \n\nIf he goes to a BBQ with his friends on a Friday night and I don't want to go, I go watch the stars or hang out with my friends. \n\nYou're allowed to do separate things.\n\nI don't know why you'd be with someone who can't even feign interest in your interests and compromise once in awhile but thats your business...", "NTA but holy hell, why have you put up with this for so long?  You are a human being and entitled to enjoy and attend events that you want to.  If he doesn't want to go, or can't sit through them for you without complaining, you absolutely should go on your own, or with friends.  \n\nI really applaud you for buying yourself that ticket and having a wonderful time - a lot of people would just cave under the pressure.  I'm curious if this experience will become a real eye opener in your marriage though, because him harassing you, and getting your MIL to harass you, is a bad sign.", "Fuck no you\u2019re not the AH", "NTA.

And you can't be the ONLY one who compromises.", "NTA  It's fine for you to have different interests and you don't need to be tied together all the time.

You are allowed to have interests and hobbies of your own, and you don't have to do everything with your husband. Does he have friends of his own that he can do things with? Tell him that he's welcome to spend time with them occasionally, just as you can go out with your friends. It's healthy and productive to have separate interests.\n\nBottom line, you've done nothing wrong. Hopefully your husband can learn to be open minded and compromising.

Also, it's ok for partners to sometimes do things individually.\n\nYour SO and both families are kinda AH, though, your husband for never compromising and both families for trying to force you to submit when they probably don't know he always get his way.", "ESH, OP, you indicate, When we were dating we used to always go out to where he wanted to go. I never bothered to tell him where I wanted to go because I didn't want to bother him.\" sounds like you didn't let him see your authentic self.\n\nI don't believe couples have to have the same interests in order to order to be compatible. It's fine you have other interests and fine that each do then separately. However, how you went about this was passive aggressive and his reaction was over the top.

He needs to figure out how to adult, and understand that you have differing interests.  And the solution to that cannot be that you, as a couple, always do what he wants or a tantrum ensues.

Yes, sometimes when things are going very wrong you want to get the input (not direction) of others, sometimes to include parents.  But you are never as a couple going to learn the arts of compromise and mutual support if you are mommied and daddied with every conflict.\n\nEdit - never or infrequently really bringing this issue with him also contributed to the issue - especially if this is one-sided way to determine activities is something he now assumes is okay because it's always been that way.

He likes to go hiking, rides bike and goes to the beach. I on the other hand enjoy operas, musicals and plays. **He's made it very known that he thinks that what I like is boring. \"**", "It sounds more like OP just shut up after her partner kept shooting down her interests. She doesn\u2019t seem afraid to mention her interests when prompted, when her husband asked what she thought they should do, she brought up the piano recital. It seems the problem is her husband either usually chooses not to prompt her or just insults her interests until she gives up and does what he wants to avoid a fight.\n\nIt\u2019s not for lack of knowledge on her husband\u2019s part. It\u2019s lack of care.", "We first started dating when I was around 16 so I was really naive and didn't understand that this was not ok. He was also one of the first guys that I had dated and wanted to do everything right. My parents are very religious and believe that a womens duty is to keep her man happy. I followed that belief and wanted to make him happy. Later in our dating life I realized that I didn't have to follow that rule. I tried to talk to him about doing stuff that I liked but we always got into massive fights so I stayed quiet.", "He's a fucking tool that's the problem", "He\u2019s just pouting over the fact that for the first time EVER his wife thought for herself and chose for herself. OP: he should be doing the things you love too. I went and spent $300 for the SpongeBob Musical for my hubby\u2019s bday a few years back. I HATE SPONGEBOB. But he loves it and I love him. When you love someone you are willing to do the stuff they like. At the very least, he should say: well I\u2019ll do this but you have fun with that. AT LEAST.\n\nSit down and tell him that it\u2019s NOT OK that you guys only do the things he likes. Hell tell him about the SpongeBob thing. Make him get that your interests are as important as his and you two will switch off and do the stuff EACH OF YOU likes. If he refuses, maybe you should take a closer look at your relationship", "It\u2019s not sad at all. I too love going out alone.", "Not just HIS mommy but HER parents as well. WTH? 5 people in a marriage is way too many.", "OP is trying to course correct now, so I support her. \n\nNTA, not even close.", "How did he manage before you two were married? I mean, he has to have gone out alone then, right?", "Fine, he can go with friends, coworkers, siblings. Big baby\n\nNTA", "He doesn't want to go out alone yet refuses to compromise and sit through your interests? Sounds like he wants it all without having to give anything. He wants your company and his interests and screw what you want.", "Does he understand that you're not an accessory to be carried around like a toddler's favorite teddy bear?  Then again, he didn't hesitate to call mommy and tell on you, so his behavior is consistent, at least.", "Sounds like he needs some friends....", "I don't disagree he doesn't care, but because she was always acquisessing to his interest the president was set that they just always do what he would want to do.", "I never bothered to tell him.  That's on OP.  Before you get married be your true self.", "It's a little late and now they find themselves incompatible in what they want as a partner.  Husband wants a spouse to always do things with and loves the outdoors..", "He has gone alone a few times but we used to get into major fights so I just went along with it", "Right, and he set that precedence by always starting a fight whenever she brought up doing something she wanted to do. She wasn\u2019t hiding her interests from him, he knew, she just wanted to avoid a fight. I don\u2019t think being yelled into submission makes her an AH; it makes him an AH for thinking that\u2019s an acceptable way to treat his partner.", "She didn\u2019t make in known *where she wanted to go* because he\u2019d already made it very known that he found her interests boring. She wasn\u2019t hiding her true self, she just suppressed it *after* he saw her true self and decided to mock her for it.", "There is no reason that they can't change and find a solution for both of them. If hubby can't change to make the marriage good for both of them then they might consider splitting up.", "I worded that wrong, rather than before you two were married I should have said before he met you. He managed to go out alone before meeting you, so there\u2019s no reason why you should have to tag along with a grown man every time he goes out. He needs to be able to do his own thing without you.\n\nHe sounds like a volatile partner. I\u2019m very proud of you for standing up for yourself!", "He seems really controlling.  You are allowed to do things you want to without his involvement and he should be able to go out alone without having to have you there.  The fact the families are backing him up is not great especially since it's a relatively isolated occurrence.  You need to reinforce what you enjoy and make sure that he is appreciating that.  You should at least get every other weekend to pick what to do.  \n  \nHas he ever gone to the things you want?  You probably need to discuss the need for validation of your interests.  \n  \nAlso, what the literal fuck that he called his parents and had them call you.  He's a fucking adult.  Late 30s is waaaaaay to old to cry to mommy and daddy that your spouse didn't want to go to the club with you.  Pretty much any age over 14 is too old for that.", "Why did you never express your interests before marriage?"]}
