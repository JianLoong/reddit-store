My parents let me know they are gifting us a certain amount of money as a wedding gift, and to help pay for the reception. Fianc\u00e9s family will not help with the wedding funds, but we are not sure if they will give us a gift later. Before anyone asks, they can afford it they just chose not to help, which is their right. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is not good with money, and has been avoiding paying off his debts since I met him. In all it is about $6,000, it was $2,000 when we met. He chooses not to work as much as he could (ie he can work 40+ hours a week at his job but often times only works 30-35), and he took several weeks off recently because of a move when really he only needed maybe one week. \n\nI end up paying for most stuff, even though he always says he will get it next time. Groceries, utilities, pet food, etc. He pays maybe 1/3 of our expenses at most. This is somewhat proportional to our income, but he could easily make more if he worked the hours he is offered. He also chooses to stay at a lower paying job even though he has the opportunity to apply for some significantly better ones. A few jobs he chose not to apply for were $10+ more per hour and had way better benefits.\n\nI have used some of the gift from my parents to pay for unexpected expenses (medial treatment and car repair) and he is now asking if he can use the money to pay his debt. I don\u2019t have any debt, I own my car and student loans are paid off. He says it\u2019s only fair we use the funds to pay his debt because I used some of the money too ($1,500). The thing is, I wouldn\u2019t have had to use that money if he was contributing more equally to our expenses. \n\nHe usually pays the minimum on his credit card and keeps accruing interest. And he spends his money on unnecessary items like cigarettes, top shelf weed, and Door Dash. \n\nWe were already planning to keep our finance\u2019s separate, so his debt won\u2019t be my responsibility even when we are married. We had planned to use whatever funds we have left after paying for the wedding/reception to put a down payment on a house. $6,000 towards his debt would use a lot of what is left over, we\u2019d maybe have $2,000 left for the down payment.\nThis is causing some tension between us and I know that paying his debt would help him get ahead. But I\u2019m also worried that he will just keep working less and expecting me to pay for everything, or even accrue more debt. \n\nI make about $15/hr more than him, which I know adds up but I\u2019m still struggling to make ends meet too. I am just more frugal because I know I have to be. And part of why I have to be is because I\u2019m carrying him.\n\nI told him that if his parents or family members gift us money he can use that for his debt, but that the money my family is giving us will go towards our future.\n\nOkay Reddit, am I being too controlling and AITA?", "created_utc": 1677904121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hpfjw/aita_for_not_paying_fianc\u00e9s_debt_with_wedding/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not even married yet and you are struggling financially with your fiancee. He doesn't pull his financial weight, his debt has TRIPLED in the time you've been together, he has no apparent desire to work harder or smarter (better job), why oh why are you doing this to yourself? Think of this drag after 10 years, after 20? Add to it potential children and that cost. You will be drowning and he will be just poking along. Do yourself a favor and really consider if this is the life you want. NTA by the way.", "NTA\n\nYou need a big reality check.\n\nYou absolutely shouldn't get married to your fianc\u00e9 if there is this much debt with him. Additionally, don't get married if he isn't serious about his finances. This will destroy your marriage.\n\nEven though you said you'll keep separate finances, your finances will be intertwined one way or another.", "NTA.\n\nMoreover, are you sure you want to enter into a marriage with someone who's shown no ability to manage his finances, nor any willingness to have better habits? \n\nUsing the gifted money isn't keeping your finances separate, and I feel like that's going to be a slippery slope if you do get married. If you really insist on going through with this marriage, please take steps to protect yourself financially.", "NTA.\n\nDo not sign on the dotted line with this guy until he proves he can learn to balance his finances.", "NTA ... PRENUP \n\nIf he is irresponsible with money now, he will get worse later. I forsee a work injury, he will malinger, take more pot for his crippling anxiety, you will be th AH for nagging and not understanding while you work full time and he plays video games at home. Your house will be a mess because he is too depressed to live up to your unreasonable idea of cleanliness.... and maybe you will end up divorced paying him child support because he was the one around for the kids..ish.\nScreen shot and take a look at this in 5 years.", "Why are you marrying him?  He seems like an underachieving freeloader who will be nothing but dead-weight in the Zombie Apocalypse.\n\nGoing with NTA, though it\u2019s tempting to go with ESH because the communication about money is such a catastrophe here.", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 sounds like a financially irresponsible child. \n\n* Why are you marrying someone that thinks doing the bare minimum while racking up debt is acceptable?\n* Why are you guilting yourself into feeling bad about not paying off an adults debt with your parents money?\n\nI think it's smart to keep finances separate but highly recommend doing some deep reflection on whether or not you're both ready to get married right now. Sounds like you need to take some more time to work out the financial imbalance and irresponsibility.", "NTA.  Oh boy...if he is this irresponsible before you are married, it is only going to get worse after you are married.  You say your finances will be separate, but you see how you are carrying most of the load now, you are already impacted.  Please think long and hard before you tie yourself to him.", "NTA at all. This is just the beginning of you having to babysit him and make him be responsible. This is just the beginning of your money arguments. \n\n\nI know you didn't come here for money advice, but I can't help it because I'm a financial planner. His debt IS your problem. When you buy a house, they look at income, debt to income ratio, and credit score. He'll bring you down, big time. When you have a big home repair or a crisis, he won't be able to contribute, unless he's running up more debt. What about children, retirement contributions, paying for vacation? No part of your life will be equitable. You're going to end up parenting him.", "NTA.

His debt has already increased considerably since you got together. Please take a pause and ask yourself if you want to legally entangle your financial affairs with this guy by marrying him. I would not even consider marriage until he clears the majority of his debt - himself,not with your parents\u2019 wedding gift - and has demonstrated a significant period of financial responsibility, (years not months), including increasing his earning power, which is well within his control.", "NTA\n\nFrom what you've told us your fiancee sounds like he can't be trusted with money. I would not pay off his debt because he will just accrue more later. Once you are married though his debt will affect your ability to apply for loans and you could become liable for his debt once you're married. His recklessness with money is a huge red flag and will most likely cause a lot of financial stress in your marriage. Continue to keep your finances seperate as much as possible.", "NTA\n\nThere's a lot of problems here\n\n1. he isn't making an effort to reduce his debt\n2. he's making you feel bad for spending money on yourself, by bringing up his debts\n3. he isn't making any effort to be frugal about his spending, despite your own efforts\n4. he isn't even working the hours that he's offered\n5. not only that, he doesn't seem to recognize that you're being frugal. Either that, or he willfully ignores it.\n6. And then when your family offers you money as a gift for the wedding, he thinks it should go towards his debt\n\nHe must offer something really amazing for you to put up with this, especially since this seems to have been a thing from the very beginning\n\n>My fianc\u00e9 is not good with money, and has been avoiding paying off his debts since I met him.", "NTA just tell your bf to go to work and get serious about paying off his debt. You\u2019re right: if you pay it off, he\u2019ll just run it up again.", "NTA But the gift isn\u2019t really the biggest issue here. I REALLY think you make sure he\u2019s going to work enough hours and pay his half of mortgage and expenses before you get married. Maybe pre-marital financial counseling? Being married to a financially irresponsible person is hell on a relationship.", "NTA. Sister. Do not marry this man! You are setting yourself up for heartache and financial ruin. Delay the wedding and tell him unless he gets his act together, you\u2019re done.", "Sorry but he doesn't sound old enough to get married.  I'd think twice about marriage with him. Immaturity like that will get old fast. Nta", "NTA. Are you sure you want to marry this guy? Not only is he completely irresponsible, he's also taking you for a ride with his freeloading and empty promises to make it up. He'll continue to be this way if you continue to pay for everything, and if you break up, he'll just find another sucker to mooch off.", "NTA why are you marrying this guy? These problems will not go away. And once you have kids you will be doing all of it. Run now. He\u2019s not going to change. You\u2019ll end up broke and saddled with children and he won\u2019t lift a finger,", "NTA. BUT, be warned your future husband isn't doing a cute little dance, he is waving red flags. When you met, he was in debt and now he is in even more debt. Do you think that saying \"I do\" will magically make him financially responsible? When \"his\" debt becomes \"our\" debt, who do you think is going to be doing the work to pay it off? He isn't doing it now, why would he start?", "NTA, would your family be happy the money they gave you to help pay for your wedding ended up on your husbands credit cards? \n\nIf it really was stressing him out then he would try to pay it off, which based on what your saying he is not trying to do.", "NTA. But I would recommend thinking about your expectations for marriage. Keeping finances separate is ok, but if you need to \u201cmake up for it\u201d because he isn\u2019t willing to work as much as you, that\u2019s a problem.", "Not sure if you plan on having kids, but how does paying for them the house, not all become your responsibility? Are you sure you\u2019re are up for this with this person?", "NTA and Whoa Nellie - I\u2019m not sure you should get married without going through financial counseling with him.  Any debt he accrues in the future could become partially or even fully yours. He sounds irresponsible AF.  What will his outlook be I. Household chores contributions or child care work?  He is lazy and selfish.  I honestly would take a hard look at this and postpone the wedding and see if he grows up.", "NTA.  I would caution you that even if you keep your finances separate, marriage may still give you liabilities.  I\u2019d suggest speaking to a lawyer.  I\u2019d also suggest maybe not marrying him unless he has undergone a financial literacy course or counselling.  Having such fundamentally different approaches to money is exactly the sort of thing that causes divorce.", "NTA but why are you marrying this guy. He's lazy and entitled and doesn't do more than he has to because he knows you'll cover everything. Is this who you want to be tied to for the rest of your life? Do you really feel that this is all your worth. You need to reevaluate the whole relationship.", "NTA. Don\u2019t get involved if he continues to spend money and only pay the minimum. He seems to have no real grasp as to why that\u2019s such a bad idea. This feels like a r/relationships post. Money problems don\u2019t go away with \u201cI do\u201d.", "NTA\n\nYou would be foolish to think this person will change once you get married.\n\nYou may want to count the cost on this one.", "NTA - Financial problems/disagreements are the #1 cause of divorce. If you are not in financial agreement prior to marriage it is VERY difficult to figure it out once you are married. Reconsider where this relationship is going and have a conversation with him about how his poor financial handling impacts you. We are just strangers on the internet, and we don\u2019t know everything, but this doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of behavior you want to permanently tie yourself to. \nRemember: in marriage his debts are yours and you will be stuck paying for his laziness.", "NTA  \nBut just in case you haven't really thought this through.... You're marrying this guy.... Once you're married, his debt is your debt. Especially if you start to file taxes jointly. You may want to rethink not paying this off. Not paying it off could very easily result in garnished returns down the road.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nit is above the pay grade of Reddit.  \nHe looks like a red flag, I hope you would consider your situation once again of spending u r rest of u r life with him.

You\u2019ve been together 3 years so clearly you know how he is and it won\u2019t change.

It doesn\u2019t matter if your finances are separate you still own half his debt in the case of divorce or separation. \n\nAre you sure you want to marry someone who can\u2019t even work a full week in his early 30s?", "NTA but this deadbeat is going to continue to drag you down financially. It'd be one thing if he was actively improving his debt, but I suspect it's getting worse because you are enabling him by not expecting him to carry his weight and so he thinks he can fall back on you, especially now that you're getting married. \n\n...make sure you sign a prenup.", "If you guys ever divorce any debts he occurs during the marriage you'd be responsible for even with your finances separate. Are you willing to risk that. \nI'm not sure he's someone you want to be legally bound to", "NTA\n\nOh sweetie, I guarantee that once you\u2019re married his work ethic and hours decrease bc he knows you will HAVE to put in the extra so it doesn\u2019t affect your credit. \n\nHe is already a partial mooch.

Poorly managed debt is not urgent. Stick to the plan and use wedding funds first, then come back to the not so urgent stuff.", "NTA. And do not marry this person until you see eye to eye on finances.\n\nKeeping your finances separate is not a foolproof solution. Just search this sub for other people that are having issues despite having separate finances. Ultimately, you are married, and you are joining your lives together. Your fianc\u00e9's irresponsibility with money will not get better, and if you give him this money, it will likely get worse because he\u2019ll know that you will bail him out. \n\nFinancial disagreements and difficulties are the leading cause of divorce. You\u2019re starting off on the wrong foot. \n\nGet your financial house in order before you say \u201cI do\u201d and buy a physical house with this guy.", "I don\u2019t think you should do this.  This is a good way to learn about how he feels about money.  Run if you don\u2019t like it.", "NTA- don\u2019t marry him unless his debt is gone and he has proved he can manage his money.", "Tell him straight up that you didn't use that $1500, HE did. It sounds like it was making up a shortfall in the budget that was the result of his overspending/choosing not to work. Essentially, he spent that money on his debt to you.\n\nI wouldn't marry this guy unless I was financially and emotionally ready to pay 100% of the expenses. Even if you live somewhere that you can keep your finances separate (legally and formally, not just in practice), that doesn't actually protect you from the consequences of his choices. You're already having to pay for his share at times, and it sounds like you have different values on both financial priorities and work ethic. Will you still respect him if he quits work and 100% of whatever money he can scrape together goes to weed and cigarettes? Does he use his extra time to do the majority of the cooking and cleaning?\n\nNever marry someone assuming that they will change for the better. I'm not saying the people can't or won't change, but if you don't want to marry the person he is right now, shitty financial habits and all, why do you think he will change once you're legally on the hook for his debt?", "Why in all the holy heck did you agree to marry him?  And don't tell me ooo I love him so much with heart emoji's.   Marriage is a LONNNNG term commitment.  LOOOOONG.  I've been married over 25 years.  His lack of commitment to taking care of his own separate responsibilities is a huge clue that he's not ready.  His mental state has nothing to do with his greed and frankly lazy habits.  If he won't work hard to support his own life, he is in no way capable of helping support you throughout life.  And should you have children, you may as well resign yourself now to being a single parent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA for not respecting yourself enough.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I bet Mommy and Daddy would clean up his messes in a heartbeat if he asked. I'm sure they've done it multiple times before.", "I wish he did the majority of the cooking and the cleaning. I do most of the cleaning around the house, and we share the cooking. I do most of the dishes too. I've tried to get him to clean more since he is home a lot more often, but he honestly just doesn't care about cleanliness that much. To a certain extent that is okay, but sometimes things get really bad until I take a weekend day to clean up the house. \n\nUgh the more I type the worse this sounds...I think a serious conversation is in order. \n\nI dated a man for 5 years that any time I brought up an issue would shut me down and refuse to talk about it. I just got so used to that that I don't know how to bring things up anymore. I need to work on that so that I can address this with my fianc\u00e9 and not let it fester like with my ex.", "We had already decided on a prenup since we both currently own our own houses and will both get small inheritances that we agree we should both protect just in case. We live in my house and he rents his out, but unfortunately too cheaply because he isn't making any rental income just barely paying for the house. The plan is to rent mine out too and buy one that is ours, but we'll see.", "We had already decided on a down payment for a house before my car/medical issues came up. He didn't suggest using any of the money for his debt until after I had used some for my expenses. But like I said, I wouldn't have needed to use it for that if he was pulling his weight. \n\nI love him a lot and I have obviously overlooked a little too much because of that. I'm just not sure where to go from here. I was alone most of my adult life before I met him, and the unconditional love that he has shown me is something that I had given up ever finding outside of my family.", "I actually already am having trouble doing a few things I want because of this. Which is really pissing me off since I should have no trouble paying for it. A few friends are going on vacation and one of my girlfriends even offered to pay for my travel expenses just so I can go. I feel horrible even considering taking her up on it.  Reading all of these comments is making me realize how much worse this is than I originally thought.", "Good point. Honestly if I were OP I would think long and hard before marrying him. I think it will be a resentful and tumultuous marriage due to the financial inequity.", "We don't live in a community property state and we had both already agreed on a prenup. I hadn't even thought of child support or alimony though, thank you for bringing that up. We are planning to have kids and we had always imagined that he would be the one to stay at home since I have a much better job than him. Now I'm second guessing that plan.", "A dog offers that", "Or maybe you need to step back to find out whether he is actually willing to put in the effort to take care of himself, or whether he's comfortable just continuing to drain you. \n\nThere was a personal finance blog I used to read that felt like fingernails on a chalkboard sometimes because the blogger's husband always had an excuse. He neeeeded an $800 pool table (even if their house desperately needed repairs). He coooouldn't handle his own disability aid application or even try to get a part-time job, so she had to work through her own chronic disabilities to bring in all their income. He neeeeded to stop at the convenience store to get a soda every time he took the dog to the park because: he didn't like water and he didn't like juice and he didn't like coffee or tea and he couldn't bring a store-bought soda can from home because it wouldn't be cold enough by the time he left the park. And she put up with it for years because he loved her and she was sorry for him. But you can feel sorry for someone and suffocated too.", "Maybe put a pause on the wedding until you have sorted out the financial issues. It's only gonna get worse once you're married. Marriage won't magically fix these issues. It will just magnify them and even with keeping finances separate, once you're married, you might be on the hook for some of his debts. So fix it now, end things, or get married and prepare yourself to financially carry him (and any children that you have together) for as long as your marriage lasts.\n\nNTA for now. You might end up being one yourself though.", "If he's serious about premarital counseling, then HE should be the one to look for it! But my guess is that he'll just push it down the road, same as he's doing with his finances. I'll bet you find that you are the one who needs to be responsible 90% of the time (or more). That is not going to change with marriage. It will change when you leave your fiance and find someone else, who is a fully responsible and functioning adult.", "His parents are actually pretty against helping him. They aren't even doing the traditional my family pays for the wedding and his pays for the rehearsal dinner. They are 15 or so years younger than my parents and already retired, so I know they have the money. No one retires in their mid 50's without a substantial savings. \n\nMy parents would be much more likely to bail me out financially if I needed it, I just haven't needed it. And if I did need it, after helping me out they would be having a good long talk with me about my financial decisions.", "Yeah, tbh I knew the answer to the cooking and cleaning question. I think you guys have a lot you need to sort before you're ready for concrete wedding plans. Do you want kids? What would that look like, day to day? Are you on the same page about how you would divide up childcare? Do you trust that he will follow through on what he says? You don't need to tell me those answers, this is just sruff that I would need answers about before marrying someone. If kids are important to you and you wouldn'f have them with this version of him, don't move forward until you do feel good about it.\n\nMy parents low-key hated each other my whole life. It wasn't a fun environment.", "Sis, please put the breaks on the wedding. Truly. \n\nThose annoying financial habits of his are going to sink your ship.\n\nYou sound like someone with goals and ambition. You are willing to work hard to have and do what you want in life. \n\nHe is not. He is happy mooching off of other people, spending money he doesn't have on stupid stuff like cigaretts, weed and door dash. All consumables that bring instant but fleeting satisfaction.\n\nSo, you bring in all the money, do all the financial planning, do all the cooking, cleaning, your parents gave a financial gift towards the wedding but his have not and he doesn't have the cash to help contribute towards the wedding or towards building a future. BUT, he wants access to the cash gift you parents gave you. Does that sound right?\n\nHe has the money for cigaretts, weed and door dash, but because you pay all of the houeshold expenses becase he doesn't want to work, you can't afford to take a trip with your friends. Does that sound right?\n\nSis, is that what you want your future to look like? Because this is what your future will look like with this guy.", "I don't know you and you don't know me. But please, for all that's good. Please re evaluate all that's going on. A relationship is a responsibility for 2 and you are doing a lot more than him. If he can make close to 18k more a year by getting a better job and he doesn't, what can expect of him for when bad times come? Will he step up? Or will he wait for you to fix it?. Do you want to live your whole life like this?", "Please don\u2019t fool yourself, it\u2019s not unconditional love if he\u2019s not fully pulling his weight. He loves you because you take care of bills that he doesn\u2019t have to. Do you really call that unconditional love? Unconditional love is when you\u2019re loved completely with all your flaws and nothing is expected back in return. You\u2019re in a tight financial situation because of him, and he\u2019s not even bothering himself to do anything about it. You could be joining your friends on a holiday, you can\u2019t because you\u2019re paying his way. Is that truly unconditional love? He has the freedom to do whatever with his money, buy cigarettes, top shelf weed and door dash. You don\u2019t have that same freedom because you\u2019re paying the bills that he only pays 1/3 of.", "And this is only likely to get *worse* after marriage, not better. Unless he gets his act together this will likely be the rest of your life. Do you want that?\n\n((Hugs)) to you. Good luck with whatever you decide should happen next.", "I the you need to seriously think about this relationship and it\u2019s future. Once you\u2019re married, he\u2019s literally going to do nothing, if he\u2019s just doing the bare minimum now. I\u2019m actually scared for you. And reading what you wrote, I completely understand why he\u2019s family is not contributing anything. If you go ahead and marry this man, you must know that his money is his, and your money is for the both of you. You\u2019re in trouble girl.", "And this is where AITA truly excels tbh. You come here for judgment but leave with an absolute TON of new insights and great life advice by having uninvolved strangers look at your situation dispassionately. The cold hard facts do not lie.\n\nBest of luck with your decision.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 absolutely correct", "That's good.", "Be like his parents. Cut the financial cord.\n\nEdit: If not for your sake, then for your family's. The thing is they will end up bailing you out of the financial hole that he's gonna put you in. Do you wanna do that to them?", "The comments on this post have given me a lot to think about. Thank you for your advice, I really do need to reevaluate his ambitions and laziness. I love being lazy and wish I could sit around all day hanging out with my dog in the sunshine, but I am a little more in touch with the reality of life. My parents instilled some values on me that I don't think his did.", "From my own experience, the stuff that bothers you of him now, won't magically disappear when you get married. If anything, will get worse before it gets better. The random strangers of reddit love you and want the best for you. Don't be scared of letting something go if it's not what you deserve. Hugs", "That's an expensive pet to get", "ESH What do you think is going to happen after you get married?", "NTA but Never Ever marry someone in debt.\n\nIf they won\u2019t wait until they are debt free to marry, then they are 100% expecting You to pay of their current and all future debts.\n\nDon\u2019t do it, it\u2019s nothing but heart aches", "NTA, also have you spoken to a lawyer about your intentions for separate finances? Because depending where you live, once you're married there's a decent chance your money and his debt will both become shared property if you were ever to split up", "Think what your future will look like 50 years from now.  How can you retire when he accrued massive debt?  How will you fund future vacations and/or college expenses for your children? What does the medical bills look like? I\u2019ve been married for over 36 years and we\u2019ve had our differences but we had resolved them because we had the SAME values to finances and to each other.  Your resentment will grow exponentially to his debt.  It\u2019s already started.  Delay your wedding until this is sorted.", "NTA So after listening and Reading your comments you say his parents don't help you out that is because they know what he is like and don't want to enable his behaviour. ** Love is Blind** and can do and make us see things differently or more like he can make you see things differently. We are outsiders looking in this man will drag you down he is already doing that you deserve better then this. If your struggling to afford things now imagine what it's going to be like when you have kids and he wants to stay at home and basically do nothing that to me is a massive red flag especially considering you do most of the cleaning anyway. You can't push someone to do something they don't want to do its exhausting and a waste of time because we all make choices and when someone pushes you to do something you will tend to raise the barriers even more. He has made these choices not to help you more financially, not to help you with cleaning the house, not paying off his debt and expecting you to do it for him. He is leeching off you I think you know what you need to do ya its going to be hard but your going to save yourself a lot of trouble in the future and live a very happy life. After this is over take a long sun holiday, get spa treatments done and detox you deserve it after all this, I promise a weight will be lifted \u2764\ufe0f", "DO NOT MARRY THIS LOSER!!! and he really is a loser, he must be amazing in bed because he has zero else going for him by the sounds of it.  Walk away now while you can or this is your life, a life of you working hard to better yourself while he does less and less and you do more and more pick up the slack while he sits at home smoking, doing nothing around the house and appreciating nothing.  He is a taker, he will bleed you dry.  NTA", "You just wrote an entire post on why you not only shouldn't marry this dude but also why you should dump him immediately. I don't know what to say. \n\nHow do dudes talk women into this?\n\nYou said he offers love and companionship. Does he clean? Cook for you? How is he showing love? Because it sounds like he loves dipping his hand in your pocket.", "NTA. PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT TIE YOURSELF TO THIS MAN. You have to think about your future. He will be a weight of epic proportions around your neck and he will only get heavier as time passes. What do you have in common with him? What does his future hold? What are his goals and plans for the future? What does he bring to the table? Please ask yourself the hard questions before you commit.", "NTA. Make sure you have a prenup. Even if you keep your finances separate, you would be surprised with how easy it is for something to be considered a joint asset by the court in the event of a divorce if even $1 of his money went towards it. Similar concept with joint debt.", "In all honesty you would be better off alone than with this giant heap of a lazy moocher. Seriously think about your marriage, I forsee unhappiness if this isn\u2019t resolved BEFORE you get married.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYour description paints your fianc\u00e9 as frankly, a loser.

Give him the same amount you used if you really want it to be \u2018fair\u2019 though from what you wrote it seems like he has used that amount already by you paying for most stuff.

Op is about to marry a loser.", "You shouldn't have to push. If his MH is really affecting him so much that he can't be responsible enough to work & cover his own living expenses, then he has to seek help for himself. That is his own responsibility to manage his health. Could it be that he's comfortable doing the bare minimum since he knows you'll pick up his slack? If he's tripled his debt & done nothing other than ask you to bail him out, do you really think he'll change his behavior or even if he does, do you think he'll fall right back into his slacker role after you marry? Once you are married, in many places, any newly accumulated debt will be on both of you to pay off, so even though you love him now, resentment builds quickly when one partner refuses to do their fair share. Keep your money & put a hold on the wedding for now.", "Is he neurodivergent/ADHD/etc?", "You really need to think about whether this is the person you want to depend on.  If you're sick, could he help you? Does he? You're being the parent in this relationship.   You deserve much more than you're settling for.   Please don't sell yourself short.

Plenty of families have 1 parent primary earner and 1 primary caretaker. But both need to respect the hard work of the other one and work together as a team, not just waste their partners hard earned money on things they both don\u2019t agree to. For me, I\u2019d want to make a plan with him for paying off his debt, make a budget for yourself as a couple, and stick to it for at least a few years so he can prove he\u2019s trustworthy financially before getting married.", "You do most of the cleaning, dishes and share cooking while still thinking he'll make it at home with kids?", "He doesn't need to have those values when he has someone around with them that will do all this shit for him.\n\nMarrying someone who is in no way self reliant is asking for resentment and distrust to bloom.\n\nPlant the garden of your life with someone who will work to ensure beautiful things will grow.  Don't fall for the tricks of a slug who is just happy to munch away on your hard work."]}
