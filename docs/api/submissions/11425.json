My parents let me know they are gifting us a certain amount of money as a wedding gift, and to help pay for the reception. Fianc\u00e9s family will not help with the wedding funds, but we are not sure if they will give us a gift later. Before anyone asks, they can afford it they just chose not to help, which is their right. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is not good with money, and has been avoiding paying off his debts since I met him. In all it is about $6,000, it was $2,000 when we met. He chooses not to work as much as he could (ie he can work 40+ hours a week at his job but often times only works 30-35), and he took several weeks off recently because of a move when really he only needed maybe one week. \n\nI end up paying for most stuff, even though he always says he will get it next time. Groceries, utilities, pet food, etc. He pays maybe 1/3 of our expenses at most. This is somewhat proportional to our income, but he could easily make more if he worked the hours he is offered. He also chooses to stay at a lower paying job even though he has the opportunity to apply for some significantly better ones. A few jobs he chose not to apply for were $10+ more per hour and had way better benefits.\n\nI have used some of the gift from my parents to pay for unexpected expenses (medial treatment and car repair) and he is now asking if he can use the money to pay his debt. I don\u2019t have any debt, I own my car and student loans are paid off. He says it\u2019s only fair we use the funds to pay his debt because I used some of the money too ($1,500). The thing is, I wouldn\u2019t have had to use that money if he was contributing more equally to our expenses. \n\nHe usually pays the minimum on his credit card and keeps accruing interest. And he spends his money on unnecessary items like cigarettes, top shelf weed, and Door Dash. \n\nWe were already planning to keep our finance\u2019s separate, so his debt won\u2019t be my responsibility even when we are married. We had planned to use whatever funds we have left after paying for the wedding/reception to put a down payment on a house. $6,000 towards his debt would use a lot of what is left over, we\u2019d maybe have $2,000 left for the down payment.\nThis is causing some tension between us and I know that paying his debt would help him get ahead. But I\u2019m also worried that he will just keep working less and expecting me to pay for everything, or even accrue more debt. \n\nI make about $15/hr more than him, which I know adds up but I\u2019m still struggling to make ends meet too. I am just more frugal because I know I have to be. And part of why I have to be is because I\u2019m carrying him.\n\nI told him that if his parents or family members gift us money he can use that for his debt, but that the money my family is giving us will go towards our future.\n\nOkay Reddit, am I being too controlling and AITA?", "created_utc": 1677904121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hpfjw/aita_for_not_paying_fianc\u00e9s_debt_with_wedding/", "score": 841, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not even married yet and you are struggling financially with your fiancee. He doesn't pull his financial weight, his debt has TRIPLED in the time you've been together, he has no apparent desire to work harder or smarter (better job), why oh why are you doing this to yourself? Think of this drag after 10 years, after 20? Add to it potential children and that cost. You will be drowning and he will be just poking along. Do yourself a favor and really consider if this is the life you want. NTA by the way.", "NTA\n\nYou need a big reality check.\n\nYou absolutely shouldn't get married to your fianc\u00e9 if there is this much debt with him. Additionally, don't get married if he isn't serious about his finances. This will destroy your marriage.\n\nEven though you said you'll keep separate finances, your finances will be intertwined one way or another.", "NTA.\n\nMoreover, are you sure you want to enter into a marriage with someone who's shown no ability to manage his finances, nor any willingness to have better habits? \n\nUsing the gifted money isn't keeping your finances separate, and I feel like that's going to be a slippery slope if you do get married. If you really insist on going through with this marriage, please take steps to protect yourself financially.", "NTA.\n\nDo not sign on the dotted line with this guy until he proves he can learn to balance his finances.", "NTA ... PRENUP \n\nIf he is irresponsible with money now, he will get worse later. I forsee a work injury, he will malinger, take more pot for his crippling anxiety, you will be th AH for nagging and not understanding while you work full time and he plays video games at home. Your house will be a mess because he is too depressed to live up to your unreasonable idea of cleanliness.... and maybe you will end up divorced paying him child support because he was the one around for the kids..ish.\nScreen shot and take a look at this in 5 years.", "Why are you marrying him?  He seems like an underachieving freeloader who will be nothing but dead-weight in the Zombie Apocalypse.\n\nGoing with NTA, though it\u2019s tempting to go with ESH because the communication about money is such a catastrophe here.", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 sounds like a financially irresponsible child. \n\n* Why are you marrying someone that thinks doing the bare minimum while racking up debt is acceptable?\n* Why are you guilting yourself into feeling bad about not paying off an adults debt with your parents money?\n\nI think it's smart to keep finances separate but highly recommend doing some deep reflection on whether or not you're both ready to get married right now. Sounds like you need to take some more time to work out the financial imbalance and irresponsibility.", "NTA.  Oh boy...if he is this irresponsible before you are married, it is only going to get worse after you are married.  You say your finances will be separate, but you see how you are carrying most of the load now, you are already impacted.  Please think long and hard before you tie yourself to him.", "NTA at all. This is just the beginning of you having to babysit him and make him be responsible. This is just the beginning of your money arguments. \n\n\nI know you didn't come here for money advice, but I can't help it because I'm a financial planner. His debt IS your problem. When you buy a house, they look at income, debt to income ratio, and credit score. He'll bring you down, big time. When you have a big home repair or a crisis, he won't be able to contribute, unless he's running up more debt. What about children, retirement contributions, paying for vacation? No part of your life will be equitable. You're going to end up parenting him.", "NTA.

His debt has already increased considerably since you got together. Please take a pause and ask yourself if you want to legally entangle your financial affairs with this guy by marrying him. I would not even consider marriage until he clears the majority of his debt - himself,not with your parents\u2019 wedding gift - and has demonstrated a significant period of financial responsibility, (years not months), including increasing his earning power, which is well within his control.", "NTA\n\nFrom what you've told us your fiancee sounds like he can't be trusted with money. I would not pay off his debt because he will just accrue more later. Once you are married though his debt will affect your ability to apply for loans and you could become liable for his debt once you're married. His recklessness with money is a huge red flag and will most likely cause a lot of financial stress in your marriage. Continue to keep your finances seperate as much as possible.", "NTA\n\nThere's a lot of problems here\n\n1. he isn't making an effort to reduce his debt\n2. he's making you feel bad for spending money on yourself, by bringing up his debts\n3. he isn't making any effort to be frugal about his spending, despite your own efforts\n4. he isn't even working the hours that he's offered\n5. not only that, he doesn't seem to recognize that you're being frugal. Either that, or he willfully ignores it.\n6. And then when your family offers you money as a gift for the wedding, he thinks it should go towards his debt\n\nHe must offer something really amazing for you to put up with this, especially since this seems to have been a thing from the very beginning\n\n>My fianc\u00e9 is not good with money, and has been avoiding paying off his debts since I met him.", "NTA just tell your bf to go to work and get serious about paying off his debt. You\u2019re right: if you pay it off, he\u2019ll just run it up again.", "NTA But the gift isn\u2019t really the biggest issue here. I REALLY think you make sure he\u2019s going to work enough hours and pay his half of mortgage and expenses before you get married. Maybe pre-marital financial counseling? Being married to a financially irresponsible person is hell on a relationship.", "NTA. Sister. Do not marry this man! You are setting yourself up for heartache and financial ruin. Delay the wedding and tell him unless he gets his act together, you\u2019re done.", "Sorry but he doesn't sound old enough to get married.  I'd think twice about marriage with him. Immaturity like that will get old fast. Nta", "NTA. Are you sure you want to marry this guy? Not only is he completely irresponsible, he's also taking you for a ride with his freeloading and empty promises to make it up. He'll continue to be this way if you continue to pay for everything, and if you break up, he'll just find another sucker to mooch off.", "NTA why are you marrying this guy? These problems will not go away. And once you have kids you will be doing all of it. Run now. He\u2019s not going to change. You\u2019ll end up broke and saddled with children and he won\u2019t lift a finger,", "NTA. BUT, be warned your future husband isn't doing a cute little dance, he is waving red flags. When you met, he was in debt and now he is in even more debt. Do you think that saying \"I do\" will magically make him financially responsible? When \"his\" debt becomes \"our\" debt, who do you think is going to be doing the work to pay it off? He isn't doing it now, why would he start?", "NTA, would your family be happy the money they gave you to help pay for your wedding ended up on your husbands credit cards? \n\nIf it really was stressing him out then he would try to pay it off, which based on what your saying he is not trying to do.", "NTA. But I would recommend thinking about your expectations for marriage. Keeping finances separate is ok, but if you need to \u201cmake up for it\u201d because he isn\u2019t willing to work as much as you, that\u2019s a problem.", "Not sure if you plan on having kids, but how does paying for them the house, not all become your responsibility? Are you sure you\u2019re are up for this with this person?", "NTA and Whoa Nellie - I\u2019m not sure you should get married without going through financial counseling with him.  Any debt he accrues in the future could become partially or even fully yours. He sounds irresponsible AF.  What will his outlook be I. Household chores contributions or child care work?  He is lazy and selfish.  I honestly would take a hard look at this and postpone the wedding and see if he grows up.", "NTA.  I would caution you that even if you keep your finances separate, marriage may still give you liabilities.  I\u2019d suggest speaking to a lawyer.  I\u2019d also suggest maybe not marrying him unless he has undergone a financial literacy course or counselling.  Having such fundamentally different approaches to money is exactly the sort of thing that causes divorce.", "NTA but why are you marrying this guy. He's lazy and entitled and doesn't do more than he has to because he knows you'll cover everything. Is this who you want to be tied to for the rest of your life? Do you really feel that this is all your worth. You need to reevaluate the whole relationship.", "NTA. Don\u2019t get involved if he continues to spend money and only pay the minimum. He seems to have no real grasp as to why that\u2019s such a bad idea. This feels like a r/relationships post. Money problems don\u2019t go away with \u201cI do\u201d.", "NTA\n\nYou would be foolish to think this person will change once you get married.\n\nYou may want to count the cost on this one.", "NTA - Financial problems/disagreements are the #1 cause of divorce. If you are not in financial agreement prior to marriage it is VERY difficult to figure it out once you are married. Reconsider where this relationship is going and have a conversation with him about how his poor financial handling impacts you. We are just strangers on the internet, and we don\u2019t know everything, but this doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of behavior you want to permanently tie yourself to. \nRemember: in marriage his debts are yours and you will be stuck paying for his laziness.", "NTA  \nBut just in case you haven't really thought this through.... You're marrying this guy.... Once you're married, his debt is your debt. Especially if you start to file taxes jointly. You may want to rethink not paying this off. Not paying it off could very easily result in garnished returns down the road.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nit is above the pay grade of Reddit.  \nHe looks like a red flag, I hope you would consider your situation once again of spending u r rest of u r life with him.

You\u2019ve been together 3 years so clearly you know how he is and it won\u2019t change.

It doesn\u2019t matter if your finances are separate you still own half his debt in the case of divorce or separation. \n\nAre you sure you want to marry someone who can\u2019t even work a full week in his early 30s?", "NTA but this deadbeat is going to continue to drag you down financially. It'd be one thing if he was actively improving his debt, but I suspect it's getting worse because you are enabling him by not expecting him to carry his weight and so he thinks he can fall back on you, especially now that you're getting married. \n\n...make sure you sign a prenup.", "If you guys ever divorce any debts he occurs during the marriage you'd be responsible for even with your finances separate. Are you willing to risk that. \nI'm not sure he's someone you want to be legally bound to", "NTA\n\nOh sweetie, I guarantee that once you\u2019re married his work ethic and hours decrease bc he knows you will HAVE to put in the extra so it doesn\u2019t affect your credit. \n\nHe is already a partial mooch.

Poorly managed debt is not urgent. Stick to the plan and use wedding funds first, then come back to the not so urgent stuff.", "NTA. And do not marry this person until you see eye to eye on finances.\n\nKeeping your finances separate is not a foolproof solution. Just search this sub for other people that are having issues despite having separate finances. Ultimately, you are married, and you are joining your lives together. Your fianc\u00e9's irresponsibility with money will not get better, and if you give him this money, it will likely get worse because he\u2019ll know that you will bail him out. \n\nFinancial disagreements and difficulties are the leading cause of divorce. You\u2019re starting off on the wrong foot. \n\nGet your financial house in order before you say \u201cI do\u201d and buy a physical house with this guy.", "I don\u2019t think you should do this.  This is a good way to learn about how he feels about money.  Run if you don\u2019t like it.", "NTA- don\u2019t marry him unless his debt is gone and he has proved he can manage his money.", "Tell him straight up that you didn't use that $1500, HE did. It sounds like it was making up a shortfall in the budget that was the result of his overspending/choosing not to work. Essentially, he spent that money on his debt to you.\n\nI wouldn't marry this guy unless I was financially and emotionally ready to pay 100% of the expenses. Even if you live somewhere that you can keep your finances separate (legally and formally, not just in practice), that doesn't actually protect you from the consequences of his choices. You're already having to pay for his share at times, and it sounds like you have different values on both financial priorities and work ethic. Will you still respect him if he quits work and 100% of whatever money he can scrape together goes to weed and cigarettes? Does he use his extra time to do the majority of the cooking and cleaning?\n\nNever marry someone assuming that they will change for the better. I'm not saying the people can't or won't change, but if you don't want to marry the person he is right now, shitty financial habits and all, why do you think he will change once you're legally on the hook for his debt?", "Why in all the holy heck did you agree to marry him?  And don't tell me ooo I love him so much with heart emoji's.   Marriage is a LONNNNG term commitment.  LOOOOONG.  I've been married over 25 years.  His lack of commitment to taking care of his own separate responsibilities is a huge clue that he's not ready.  His mental state has nothing to do with his greed and frankly lazy habits.  If he won't work hard to support his own life, he is in no way capable of helping support you throughout life.  And should you have children, you may as well resign yourself now to being a single parent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA for not respecting yourself enough.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Years ago I was in a similar position to you.

He had grand plans of having his own practice but didn\u2019t want to put in the work. \n\nWhen we met, he should have been establishing himself at a firm but was working as a freelance attorney. That should have been enough warning but I was young and dumb and had shit self esteem. At the time, the thought of being single was worse than the thought of hitching myself to a loser. Meanwhile, I was making a decent salary but lived more cautiously. I had about $75k in a 401(k) and other smaller accounts. I could afford to go on vacations and to pay off the car I wanted. \n\nMy parents obviously had concerns but I was dumb enough to believe the promises he made about how he would provide for \u201cour family.\u201d  He got a job at a small firm and I thought we were on our way to a better future. We got married. Then he was fired a year later. He just was not that good at his job. In a little under two years, most of my savings were depleted trying to keep us afloat. Meanwhile, he was turning down jobs because he was holding out for the perfect one. He had the audacity to think applying for a small business loan to set up his own shop was a good idea. I talked him out of it because his credit was shitty. So bad that at the time he had to finance a used car on a six year loan. Both his parents and mine gave us money to help us out. To give you even more of an idea of how delusional he was, he thought trying for a baby would be a good idea. Except I wasn\u2019t able to get pregnant so he suggested IVF. When I asked him how we would pay, he said \u201cGod will provide.\u201d (Yes, really.)\n\nAfter two years of this bullshit I finally gave up and filed for divorce because I didn\u2019t see it getting any better. And it didn\u2019t. I ended up in so much CC debt trying to reestablish myself. My credit tanked. And yet, I was lucky because my parents were able to help me out now that the dead weight was gone. They rightfully gave me a hard time though. I didn\u2019t listen to them and basically tanked my future. It took me 15 years to crawl out of that hole. I am now 50 and finally in a place where I have some breathing room. I have a good job that pays well but my future is still fucked because there is no way I can catch up financially to where I would have been if I hadn\u2019t drained my 401(k) and gotten into debt.

You are financially solvent, good with money, and a high earner.  Your fiance, with his debt and low work ethic, must feel like he won the financial lottery when you agreed to marry him.\n\nRethink this marriage and postpone it indefinitely, because everything you have worked so hard for up until this moment is at severe risk.  \"Compatibility\" includes having similar values in regards to money management and financial goals.  A majority of divorces happen due to a difference in money management, and you are so, so lucky to figure out he is irresponsible with money, and quite ready to entitle  himself to any money you get be it from your job or a gift from your own parents, before the ceremony. \n\nI think I would put the guy on \"probation\" for a few years:  if he can work full-time (40 hours and above per week), pay off his debt, and commit to financial courses to shore up his financial management, before that wedding becomes a reality.  I'm thinking he'll make an effort for a few months, then slack off and beg you to marry him anyway.  He might even promise to do those things \"after the wedding\".  Don't be fooled.", "The problem is that sometimes we're blinded by love and don't want to listen to what they are saying.", "Give yourself some credit, you are in touch w/ the reality of life because you are a responsible adult - because you choose to be, the \u201cfault\u201d doesn\u2019t lie w/ his parents that he chooses not to.  I sooo see myself 25 years ago, looking for all the reasons he is the way he is\u2026it took 15 years to realize .. it\u2019s because he wants to be the way he is\u2026nothing more complex than that", "So he continues to make choices that put more burdens on YOU, but make everything easier on everybody else?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like someone I would want to make a life long commitment to.", "A good partner won\u2019t make you feel like it\u2019s hard to bring up those issues. It\u2019s a simple \u201chey these need to be done more, how as a team can we do it?\u201d\n\nTbh it sounds like you jumped from an extra bad partner onto a new partner that was better then the last so you just accepted those issues without questioning them to much. Or pushing back much. Probably because you are scared of being alone.\n\nBeing alone sucks in some ways, but it\u2019s also very freeing. Especially in your case.\n\nNo more financial bullshit. No more carrying a partner who won\u2019t do more. Just focusing on yourself, what you enjoy and eventually running into the RIGHT person who will be a team with you.", "I cannot stress this hard enough! She can make that vacation time to grieve the relationship and looking at a bright future when she gets back.", "Exactly. I should've canceled my marriage to my starter husband, but didn't. We were young, stupid and should never have gotten married. Canceling is SO much easier on everyone.", "Tbh honest, being a godparent that spoils a kid rotten against the parents wishes is not a good look. Especially while saying that it was even harder than he thought or wanted. \n\nThat\u2019s a good insight to what he will do as a SAHD against YOUR parenting wishes because babysitting and spoiling the kid is a lot easier than parenting them.", "You're strong, smart, and a survivor. Sorry for your rough times in the past."]}
