He started drinking more again after awhile. He did the \u201cfind a therapist, control his drinking, quit therapy\u201d process 4 times over 5 years. Each time he\u2019d make promises and agreements. We had 2 kids along the way, the first before I realised how serious the drinking problem was, and the second after he agreed to quit completely and get fully sober. He went back on that promise and said he wanted to be in control of his drinking and only have 1-2 drinks a week. \n\nHe never got completely sober. He\u2019d flake out on promises to the kids and me, he\u2019d go out with friends who encouraged him to drink and have 2-3 drinks and then start buying bottles of vodka and gin again.

He was my husband so I agreed if he worked on staying sober. When I divorced him, it appeared out of the blue to Mary and their parents who couldn\u2019t understand why I would up and leave her brother and adamantly take the kids only letting him have visitation.

It's still going to be hard for them; they'll still have times when he lets them down or isn't there when he promised. They probably already have some level of trauma. And brace yourself that at some point they may lash out at you. I did it to my mother because she was the sober, safe one to express my difficult emotions to. These days there is a reasonable amount of support for children whose parent/s have mental disorders, which substance use has been reclassified as.\n\n[I've written below about my experience as the child of an alcoholic. Feel free to skip it if you don't have the emotional bandwidth.]\n\nMy father is an alcoholic and spent 50 years drinking himself towards brain damage from a stroke, which finally happenedin 2015. I'm 40 and he's only been \"sober\" since the stroke because the whole family decided to stop enabling him and buying his alcohol for him. He had yet another stroke on Christmas Day and I keep expecting to get the call that he's finally gone. My daughter is three and it breaks my heart that because of his drinking he's shortened his time with her, and she never got to know the kind, funny person  he was before (when he wasn't drunk).\n\n Reckoning with the end of his life has made a lot of trauma bubble to the surface for me, and I'm only just realising how much living with an alcoholic for 20+ years has damaged me and warped my perspective on people. One example: I was very emotionally attached to him but it wasn't stable or consistent because sometimes he was verbally abusive when drunk. And sometimes my mother just gave up and went to bed, and I felt like I had to help him get to bed because he couldn't walk by himself (on drunk jelly legs, not because of disability). \n\nIt engrained a distrust of authority figures, and a feeling that I can't count on them to do their job so I have to step in and do it myself. This has gotten me in massive trouble at work, and has caused fights with my husband when I get angry at him for not doing things the \"right\" way aka my way. Now that I've finally figured out why those things are happening I can work on it but it feels demoralising that at 40, and 12+ years into starting therapy, I still have deep rooted issues that are negatively impacting my life. I can't handle the smell of beer bottles in my house, even if they're non-alcoholic, because it reminds me of the dozens of bottles I used to help my mother dispose of at the recycling centre. Stale beer running up my arm.", "NTA", "NTA. Keeping his secret was enabling his behavior. He now has to be accountable for his mistakes.
