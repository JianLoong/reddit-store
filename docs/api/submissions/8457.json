We were assigned flatmates who really enjoyed cooking and baking together and became best friends. She actually introduced me to her brother \u201cJohn\u201d (35M) whom I dated and eventually married 8 years ago. We have 2 kids age 3 & 5. Mary was trilled for us, she had a close relationship with John, and remained best friends with me. \n\nJohn is very intelligent, and a bit competitive in nature, so he naturally went into an intense career field. Unfortunately he turned towards alcoholism to cope with an intense job. He started seeing a therapist who helped him identify his triggers, he drank less, and then he quit therapy think he was fixed. He started drinking more again after awhile. He did the \u201cfind a therapist, control his drinking, quit therapy\u201d process 4 times over 5 years. Each time he\u2019d make promises and agreements. We had 2 kids along the way, the first before I realised how serious the drinking problem was, and the second after he agreed to quit completely and get fully sober. He went back on that promise and said he wanted to be in control of his drinking and only have 1-2 drinks a week. \n\nHe never got completely sober. He\u2019d flake out on promises to the kids and me, he\u2019d go out with friends who encouraged him to drink and have 2-3 drinks and then start buying bottles of vodka and gin again. After the 3rd time he quit therapy I gave him an ultimatum, get sober or I was leaving him and taking the kids. I followed through with it.\n\nMary and I stayed best friends after college but John asked me to keep his drinking from his sister the first time around and didn\u2019t want her to think he had a problem. He was my husband so I agreed if he worked on staying sober. When I divorced him, it appeared out of the blue to Mary and their parents who couldn\u2019t understand why I would up and leave her brother and adamantly take the kids only letting him have visitation. Mary blamed me for the divorce and wanted to end our friendship so I told her the truth: that I loved him and still do but I wasn\u2019t willing to spend the rest of my life and ruin my kids childhood setting ourselves up for disappointment over and over again when he wouldn\u2019t stay in therapy or stay sober. \n\nMary was horrified after I told her about everything. She got very emotional when I admitted to her how many times I let myself get excited for plans her brother made with me or the kids only to be flaked on when her brother poured himself a drink after work. She went to give John a piece of her mind and asked him to get his shit together. John\u2019s now extremely upset at me for spilling his secret that I\u2019d promised to keep because \u201cMary\u2019s image of him is now rubbish\u201d and his parents are disappointed in him too. I think I had a right to explain myself to my best friend, and I no longer had a promise to keep after he broke his end of it.

To keep his reputation clean? What has he done to deserve that? No, you shouldn't be expected to keep such a secret for him.", "NTA - He thinks everyone else needs to sacrifice for his actions.

You did not deserve to lose a friend over the consequences your ex-husband chose. Also though, true alcoholism is a progressive disease. It may one day help this man (the father of your children) that his family knows what is going on with him.

Mary has been your friend longer than he's been your husband, and it sounds like she's treated you with more respect than he has.

He cared more about his (fake) image to Mary than about his (real) image to you and his children.", "NTA he broke enough promises not to have any right to ask to be protected.", "NTA.  Your silence helped enable him, of course he wants to hide and deny his problem.  His family ought to know the truth, so they can also help him, and keep him from denying his issues.", "NTA, easy, if people think he's rubbish after finding the truth, it's because of him being rubbish not you being honest.", "NTA. The truth hurts. He allowed you to take the blame for his actions. That\u2019s ok him. You set the story straight as you\u2019re not the bad guy in this situation.

He was basically asking you to sacrifice a friendship and his family's opinions of you over his own issues.

And you are NTA. \n\nKeeping his secret is a form of enabling. It hurts everyone involved. You did nothing wrong and may give him a nudge to seek actual sobriety. I am very fortunate to have finally been able to admit I am powerless over alcohol. I have been very happily sober in AA for the past 16 years. I can tell you that the therapy and controlled drinking plan does not work. Alcoholics cannot \"control their drinking.\" One drink is too many. \n\nI truly hope your husband finds his way to real sobriety. I think AA, which is free and available all over the world is the great option. But, if he is not ready, you cannot make him be. You have to take care of yourself and your family.

They could have helped him and you out. I know you wanted to be good to your husband but alcoholism is an addiction and he can't control it, it was up to you to help make rational decisions not help him commit to bad choices based on shame. This might be hard to hear and I'm sorry about the way things turned out but I hope you're more willing to go to family the next time you have such a big hardship to overcome, it might make things easier on you to rely on others. \nGood luck with everything, I hope John is able to find the right help to work on his addiction.\n\nNot saying John didn't do wrong here BTW, but starting and stopping therapy is pretty common when you aren't able to make a connection with a therapist, it is incredibly draining to go through that process even on a good day though so I give him a pass on that. Mental health care requires you to be mentally healthy to navigate, and clearly John isn't.\nEdit on phone so many autocorrected.", "NTA if he doesn't want to be seen as rubbish he should stop acting that way.

That is a recipe for disaster.\n\nAnd if he is pissed now,. Then he clearly still has a problem. Someone truly sober (or trying to be) will not have a problem with his closest family knowing.\nHe (the addict) is pissed because now, more people know, and can hold him accountable.\n\nAlso, you are absolutely right, only to allow supervised visitation until he is sober.\n\nYour kids safety is more important than his pride", "NTA - He broke his promise to you. You did nothing wrong here. He is upset because he messed up and is being called on it.", "NTA at all\n\nOf course he's pissed, you refused to let the bus he threw you under run over you.

You don't owe him anything anymore.", "NTA, my mother has been in your situation and has always hid my father's drinking problem. Because of this, my father's family thought very badly of her. She left him when i was around 5yo.\n\nWhen his family found out he was an alcoholic, my mother was blamed because it was because she had left him, according to my grandparents.\n\nMy mother never spoke badly of my father, which must not have been easy.\nMy father died young due to his alcohol abuse.
