{"id": 6957, "submission_id": "10821w2", "title": "AITA For Reminding My SIL And Brother That I Earn More Than Them", "selftext": "So my (M30)  mom (F51) decided to invite my in-laws and some of her friends over for dinner. My wife (F29) and I were initially hesitant since her family and mine don't always get along. They don't openly fight or anything, but lots of passive-aggressive behaviour and this usually makes us feel uncomfortable since we're in the middle of both families.\n\nThis time, however, they got along just fine. I did notice that both my siblings and her siblings were getting along, but the problem was, they were getting along by talking about all the things they disliked about my wife and I. This was hurtful, but we let it slide, since they were finally making conversation and it was small nitpicks like my wife being a bit of a slob, or me being weird about other people driving my car (it's expensive). No harm done. \n\nLater in the night, my SIL Candice (F28) and my brother Frank (M25) were talking about how they each work 2-3 jobs and average over 100 hours a week each. They talked about how their work ethics were better than mine and my wife's and how they are more mature. I still let it slide. They talked about how we don't own a home yet (I don't mind renting) and how we waste our money on vacations etc. \n\nAt a certain point I got a bit irritated and just said that my work ethic was better than theirs. I managed to double my income through promotions at work in the last 3 years and it would take 2 of their jobs to make up my one. I mentioned that my wife and I prefer to spend our money on travel, and will try to buy property when older. We still save money for our kid (F3) who will have $80, 000 set aside in her bank by the time she gets to grade 12. I mentioned how both my wife and I had to start working early and take extra responsibility in the house through our chidhoods to help our parents and take care of our younger siblings. I told them that where we spend our money is our business and they need to get their heads out of their asses. \n\nThey both got upset and said they didn't understand why I was being aggressive. I said I was quiet long enough while they were being rude in front of guests.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673329876, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10821w2/aita_for_reminding_my_sil_and_brother_that_i_earn/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it's poverty, they may be justifying their suffering. Otherwise, they're prioritizing money over health. I seriously doubt they're sleeping 8 hours a night or taking time to decompress (if they're not lying about the hours worked).", "NTA.

They have no problem criticizing your life choices in front of everyone but when you drop some truth bombs, they don\u2019t hesitate to play victim.

If they are talking shit about you loud enough for you to hear, you can tell them off right then and there.", "To be fair, I find that method doesn't work well on passive-agressive people. That method works better on direct people because you're changing gears on them and forcing them to stop and think, whereas with passive-aggressive people you're just (in their mind) sinking to their level and engaging in more opportunities for back and forth.", "One lesson I learned from being born and raised in NYC - but my parents were from the Midwest  so non-confronting and always letting things slide - just shut that shit down when it comes up.

End of story.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be loud, threatening or aggressive, it might feel that way because you aren\u2019t used to firmly stopping people from shitting on you.  You can come up with a way to stop it right away without making a scene. If they choose to make a scene, that\u2019s on them.", "Trying to make passive-aggressive people stop by quietly confronting them just seems to give them the opportunity to insist they're not doing anything wrong and you're the one making a scene.  Which, they were going to do eventually anyway.  But sooner."]}
