I did notice that both my siblings and her siblings were getting along, but the problem was, they were getting along by talking about all the things they disliked about my wife and I. This was hurtful, but we let it slide, since they were finally making conversation and it was small nitpicks like my wife being a bit of a slob, or me being weird about other people driving my car (it's expensive). No harm done. \n\nLater in the night, my SIL Candice (F28) and my brother Frank (M25) were talking about how they each work 2-3 jobs and average over 100 hours a week each. They talked about how their work ethics were better than mine and my wife's and how they are more mature. I still let it slide. They talked about how we don't own a home yet (I don't mind renting) and how we waste our money on vacations etc. \n\nAt a certain point I got a bit irritated and just said that my work ethic was better than theirs. I managed to double my income through promotions at work in the last 3 years and it would take 2 of their jobs to make up my one. I mentioned that my wife and I prefer to spend our money on travel, and will try to buy property when older. We still save money for our kid (F3) who will have $80, 000 set aside in her bank by the time she gets to grade 12.

Also, it might help to understand that bragging about working 100 hours a week comes from insecurity and jealousy. Neither of these are excuses, just a terrible dynamic playing itself out.", "I love your comment. I had to laugh at this because i often do that, kick to the head when shit piles up and boils over. Definitely not the best solution.", "Yeah they\u2019re literally lying. Maybe 100 \u201cwork involved hours\u201d including commutes between jobs, getting changed, ect. But no way it\u2019s 100 paid hours on average.", "Honestly if someone tries to one-up me in this way, I usually go with the semi-sympathetic \u201coh man why would you do that to yourself?! That must SUCK!\u201d\n\nYou would be amazed how quickly the tone changes to \u201cit\u2019s not so bad, actually!\u201d Every fucking time.", "Okay now with home work you\u2019ve got me thinking of Office Space, that plus Uber\u2026\n\n\n\u201cHow would you earn a million bucks?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo jobs at the same time, man\u201d", "I like that explanation, that you have to change the method based on the behavior.  And that it's circular.", "You\u2019ve just made me realize why I so often skip straight to aggressive with my in-laws \ud83e\udd2f", "Never thought of it this way. Brilliant.", "ESH\n\nRemind yourself that pay rate does not equal work ethic.", "NTA gotta love the bullies who bully people for an entire evening, and then cry the minute you give a little back to them.", "NTA. You shook them up and you told them why you did it or why you blundered into being aggressive, which is a perfectly understandable reason.", "NTA, but I have to wonder why everyone dislikes yall so much?  Is it just jealousy or something we're not being told?  NTA though for the info we've been presented with.", "NTA,  they shouldn't have been talking shit \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA whatsoever.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a flex like they think to work yourself to death. Work smarter not harder really is a thing. If I had to work 100 hours a week with multiple jobs just to live I\u2019d need to find a new career.", "NTA\n\nSounds like they needed a reality check, that what they thought and what was reality turned out to be 2 very different things.\n\nHowever Op, you now will need to make sure that the only way they can talk to you or your wife, is through a landline with a message recorder, as now you have opened up a door where chances are they are going to talk, and soon you will have them coming to contact you, with hands out.  And be prepared for the bashing to increase on how you could help out someone in need and are so selfish and greedy not to.  \n\nWhen money and income are concerned, mixing it with talk among family is always a bad idea.\n\nSides you should have remained silent and waited until you and your wife did purchase a house that would have made them wonder how did you do it.", "NTA, but these people set you up to take a fall. They baited you into an argument. Next time, walk away. I mean it. Walk away. And check out r/TrueNarcissisticAbuse to see if your brother and his wife fall under this category. If so, it's time to start avoiding them.", "Maybe you two families might not need to see each other or work it out.  Family does not realize how precious they are, until it is to late.  \nI do not know how anyone is happy by making someone feel bad.", "You can't claim your work ethic is better and neither can they. Unless you know you kiss ass to get ahead. I have worked my ass off and know I have good work ethic. Due to not being able to find work that pays more than minimum wage, I've had to have multiple jobs at a time just to live. Just be grateful you are lucky enough to have well paying job", "kind of both are AH. Promotions aren\u2019t always available at jobs and if they\u2019re working insane hours then both of you have great work ethics, it doesn\u2019t have to be a comparison like that", "NTA. It got to a point where they needed to be set straight. Also, for the record, nobody drives my car but me. I'm with you on that.", "Such weird topics to even discuss openly. \ud83e\udd14 Maybe this is why they have to work 2-3 jobs to make ends meet, no filters from their brain to their lips. They need to learn class. I'm not sure I'd invite them back either.", "Sounds like those two should hook up. They sound perfect for each other. NTA", "So why would you purposely choose to rent instead of own a house?  You\u2019re literally flushing money down the toilet. If you make enough money to buy a house I literally can\u2019t think of a compelling reason to continue renting\u2026", "ESH, bragging about money is just as bad as bragging about being exploited for 100 hours a week. do none of you have your own merits that aren't tied to employment?", ">When you assume, you make an ass out of you and me!\n\nThis is why I only presume, but never assume\n\nI really hate that phrase. It's an insult based on a pun, and the result is about what you'd expect.\n\nAnd it's bad advice. Assuming things is essential to every day life, it's in our language, (as in \"did you assume my gender\" which nobody really says), it's in our habits.\n\nImagine you go shopping and pick up an item and start heading for the front of the store. Someone questions you, are you planning to steal that? No, of course not, you're going to buy the item at the checkout. \"Sir, the checkout is at the back of the store, did you just assume it was at the front?\" Yes. Yes, you did assume the checkout was at the front of the store. You had good reason to assume that, and that doesn't make you an ass.", "I was trying to say that my work ethic got me my promotions, which has now led to the higher pay rate!", "Down payments for homes where we live is 20% the total value. The average townhouse sells for about 1 million. I would have to save up, and put off any family holidays, or fun date nights etc. For a couple of years to afford that. \n\nI'm locked in with a good rental price, which is lower than mortgage, since I locked in before the rental price boom happened. \n\nI'm saving for what's important, like my kids future for now.", "Absolutely, I almost never bring up money, or work with friends and family. Hence, why I made the post, cause it felt bad to bring it up.", "That would have only made things worse in my experience.", "You\u2019ve also had 5 more years working on a career than your brother, and if he\u2019s working 100 hours/week between 2-3 jobs, there really isn\u2019t any rational criticism to give him there. \n\nOther than your pay rate, you haven\u2019t given any examples to judge you on, other than putting your foot in your mouth on this topic.", "Being an asshole to someone who deserved it still makes you an asshole.", "He wasn't an asshole tho. They were.", "I worked in tax and had to do 100 hour weeks now and again during busy season.  They're absolute hell.  There is no way they're doing 100 hrs average unless they're buying new clothes constantly because there's no time to do laundry working that much.  I bought clothes and had them shipped to the office during busy season each year.  Twice a year.  So fucking glad to be out of tax.", "your opinion, i disagree", "Lmfao yeah exactly, I\u2019ve pulled the \u201cbuying new work clothes because you have no time for laundry\u201d stunt myself and I agree it is possible, if you have a single job with huge hours, like trucking, to max at 100 hours but literally no ONE is doing it on average and splitting between multiple jobs makes it even less likely.", "I just screenshot this comment to look back on when I need this reminder. This was such a great articulation for this scenario and I liked how it resonated with me when I read it. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "Disagree. OP did nothing to provoke their rude and stupid behavior. Don't dish it if you can't take it.\n\nNTA", "like i said, being the asshole second still makes you an asshole."]}
