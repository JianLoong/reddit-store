Otherwise it doens't make sense why anyone would expect someone else to pay for their vacation and then complain .\n\nWhy would you pay for 3 additional ppl ? Why did your granny thought it is ok to invite them ? She should have been the one who says  no to them .\n\nYou are not rude your mom is a pushover who allows ppl to use her kindness .

Why did you pay for their vacation?", "NTA", "Whoever paid for people to invite themselves is an asshole but you are NTA for not trying to be nice to rude people.", "ESH , they are obvious Aholes\n\nBut why would you pay for their tickets if they where not welcome? If you agree to them comming it was rude to then ignore them. IF it bothered you that much just own it and not bring them along", "Of course NTA. Did she tell them how rude they were?", "Did you pay or did your mom/grandma did?", "wtf, i would not have a paid a cent for uninvited AHs. NTA", "YTA. I suspect all of you were assholes to each other.", "ESH. I can understand, that you were annoyed by them, but to ignore them when they are speaking to you or \"clear the throat\" is child like behavior.", "ESH -- They repotedly crashed a vacation and did not pay a cent for the experience. \n\nI realized my error in asking how old you are but it came to mind since it mirrored how 5th grade children react who have not acquired social strategies to manage their emotions and reach a goal (e.g., vacation: Have a good time).\n\nYou were rude to your gma and friends. Were you blindsided during your vacation? yes. Does this justify treating them poorly? No. Simply removing yourself from them at intervals or days would have sufficed. Are you responsible for 'you' to enjoy yourself on your vacation? Yes.  At what point did you convey your needs, \"Hello ladies, so glad you're here. I need to Venmo you the details your the trip fees to make a payment today.\" Of course update gma first incase she is paying. This one solution demonstrates you expect to be paid....speak up for yourself instead of brewing to peak frustration of 'clearing you throat\", etc. \n\nThere is quite a bit of detail missing like...how/why did you pay for the uninvited guests? This was within your control to decline. Most vacation venues offer options; did you make plans to explore w/out them and have fun; putting distance between you and the ladies who got on your last nerves? This and other creative strategies would ensure you enjoyed yourself more and reduced exposure to the free loaders. \n\nWhy did these ladies think someone was paying their way? This is odd behavior. Most of us save up PTO, stash cash for vacations and understand the value or enjoying every minute. They seem old enough to 'get this'...what story were they told to show up with packed bags and no funding for the 'fun'?\n\nINFO: How old are you?\n\nYou \"..ignored them and...would loudly clear my throat.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
