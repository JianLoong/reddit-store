However, it doesn't sound like she's ever actually directly critiqued you, never said \"that's so shallow\" or \"omg you must be sooooo vain\" or anything like that. She's annoying, yes, but not openly mean-spirited.\n\nYou, however, sound mildly unpleasant. When she tried to participate in the conversation the first time, was your reaction \"no one asked you\"? Or is that your current self looking back after she's been weird repeatedly? It was also unkind to call her a pick me and say \"no one cares.\" I can think of literally dozens of ways you could have responded that don't make you sound like a mean high-schooler, but here you are. I realize you're still quite young, but it costs nothing to be civil, and the provocation here was really very small.\n\nI encourage you to consider what might be making her behave this way-- deep-seated insecurities, poor social skills, new-girl syndrome, bad prior experiences with groups of feminine girls, etc-- and consider whether your reaction was necessary. The way to make a girl like this stop is not to alienate her further, thereby reinforcing whatever negative feeling she has about girly girls, but rather to invite her in.

My impression for pick me's are feminine girls (in fact I am thinking that the older girl here while talking to her friends she could say \"that young girl at work is so pick me, she tries too hard with make up to make all males love her\") that they go out of their ways to please their dates or perspective dates. That is why I am saying since pick me disregard their personal opinions and want to please the \"boy\" they are careful of what they look, they are easy going (to boy-s) and they dish all other women.
