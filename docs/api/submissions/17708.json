I don't agree with her behavior, but calling her a \"pick me\" isn't a good look for you and makes you seem a little judgmental.  Instead maybe ask her why she feels the need to compete with the rest of you.  \"I wear makeup and invest in my skincare products because it makes me feel good.  I know that it's not for everyone.  Why does what I choose to buy and use bother you?\"", "I was coming into this post (after reading the first paragraph) anticipating this to be a clique-y girl making fun of someone who is happy to be who they are.\n\nHowever, after reading on, yeah she\u2019s a pick-me girl lol. NTA, she\u2019s trying to one-up you for whatever fucking reason with this \u201call natural elitism\u201d. It\u2019s cringe.\n\nAs others have said though, you don\u2019t really need to be obtuse with her. Don\u2019t taint your own image in an effort to tell someone else off. She\u2019ll look like an idiot by herself, you don\u2019t need to help her.", "NTA.  Butt ins should butt out.  However, you can win the contest and still be socially correct.  Be civil and polite while you put her down.", "NTA.\n\nWhat was she going to report you for? Treating her the way she was treating you? Yeah.  \nTell your sister that negging is a good way to get throat punched, not so good for fitting in. She's 27, not 17.", "Why is your manager hugging you and commenting on how good you smell? \nHow old is he? \n\nI'd be more concerned about him than her behavior. I'd just ignore her when she starts it. Or if she pulls that, \"She's wearing make up!\" line if a customer compliments you again, just apologize to the customer and say, \"Sorry, she's a little feral\". She'll stop", "ESH\n\nYou both sound equally annoying.", "While your approach wasn't ideal and certainly didn't portray you in the best light I don't think you're an asshole for telling her to mind her business....however, I'm betting you really ARE an asshole based on, \"like no one asked her lmaoooo.\" I can almost hear the attitude and eye roll in that statement", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA and write down all the specifics you can remember. She is the one causing an issue. I have a friend that likes to doll up and sometimes if doesn't help her (could use some guidance) but I NEVER say anything.", "ESH she sounds annoying, but you sound pretty mean spirited.", "NTA. She seems very jealous of you and needs to grow up. She deserved to have an insult hurled her way.", "ESH.\n\nIs there something you are leaving out? She sounds annoying but it also sounds like you are being mean to the new girl and your argument doesn't exactly make much sense. \n\n> when it was my turn he said i smell good and wants to know what i use. so i started listing out the body wash, lotion and perfume i use.\n\nKinda weird to list out every product you have down to your body wash. A simple thanks would've been fine...but to then go on and snap at your co-worker telling her to not be a \"pick me cause no one cares about her what she uses\" is pretty nasty. Don't speak for others, or imply that nobody cares about her...and the comment about products she uses is weird since you're the one announcing what you use when nobody asked.", "~~NTA~~ Changing my vote to ESH because she didn't ever say anything to you that was actually mean, but everyone knows \"pick me\" is an insult.\n\nShe's obviously annoying. She hasn't managed to grow out of the urge to make herself seem different and special, and points out things about you that she thinks make her better than you in very unnecessary ways. However, it doesn't sound like she's ever actually directly critiqued you, never said \"that's so shallow\" or \"omg you must be sooooo vain\" or anything like that. She's annoying, yes, but not openly mean-spirited.\n\nYou, however, sound mildly unpleasant. When she tried to participate in the conversation the first time, was your reaction \"no one asked you\"? Or is that your current self looking back after she's been weird repeatedly? It was also unkind to call her a pick me and say \"no one cares.\" I can think of literally dozens of ways you could have responded that don't make you sound like a mean high-schooler, but here you are. I realize you're still quite young, but it costs nothing to be civil, and the provocation here was really very small.\n\nI encourage you to consider what might be making her behave this way-- deep-seated insecurities, poor social skills, new-girl syndrome, bad prior experiences with groups of feminine girls, etc-- and consider whether your reaction was necessary. The way to make a girl like this stop is not to alienate her further, thereby reinforcing whatever negative feeling she has about girly girls, but rather to invite her in. Not saying you have to do so, but being mean to her is definitely not the way to make this go smoothly.", "This woman is almost 30 years old trying to tear down a teenager, oof.

YTA", "Everyone\u2019s saying NTA, but that\u2019s such a chronically online take. You don\u2019t need to be so confrontational about every jab someone makes \u2014 especially at work. It\u2019s okay to give people some grace and let things go. It\u2019s not that deep. You both sound very annoying.\n\nESH.", "NTA for the most part, but I do think there are better ways to handle it.  Heck... maybe you should lean into it a little.  If Ms. Mila declares to you and the other gals that she hates makeup, you guys can swear up and down that that's just because she hasn't had the right guidance, and start explaining her color wheel...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In woman culture that's pretty direct. \n\nWhile this is a chance for OP to rise above and be a better person, there's also a significant age and maturity gap that must be considered. I agree that deep-seated insecurities might be a cause, but it's still a 27 year old negging women in their late teens/early twenties, and that's not ok. \n\nIn my opinion OP is NTA for clapping back, but a follow-up conversation should be held in private to figure out where this is coming from and why the attitude isn't appreciated.

Your attitude (lmaoooo) suggests you simply don't see her as worth conversing with. While you're under no obligation to chat with anyone at work, active exclusion is a form of bullying.
