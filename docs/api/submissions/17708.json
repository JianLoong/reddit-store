I don't agree with her behavior, but calling her a \"pick me\" isn't a good look for you and makes you seem a little judgmental.

Why does what I choose to buy and use bother you?\"", "I was coming into this post (after reading the first paragraph) anticipating this to be a clique-y girl making fun of someone who is happy to be who they are.\n\nHowever, after reading on, yeah she\u2019s a pick-me girl lol.

A simple thanks would've been fine...but to then go on and snap at your co-worker telling her to not be a \"pick me cause no one cares about her what she uses\" is pretty nasty. Don't speak for others, or imply that nobody cares about her...and the comment about products she uses is weird since you're the one announcing what you use when nobody asked.", "~~NTA~~ Changing my vote to ESH because she didn't ever say anything to you that was actually mean, but everyone knows \"pick me\" is an insult.\n\nShe's obviously annoying. She hasn't managed to grow out of the urge to make herself seem different and special, and points out things about you that she thinks make her better than you in very unnecessary ways. However, it doesn't sound like she's ever actually directly critiqued you, never said \"that's so shallow\" or \"omg you must be sooooo vain\" or anything like that. She's annoying, yes, but not openly mean-spirited.\n\nYou, however, sound mildly unpleasant. When she tried to participate in the conversation the first time, was your reaction \"no one asked you\"? Or is that your current self looking back after she's been weird repeatedly? It was also unkind to call her a pick me and say \"no one cares.\" I can think of literally dozens of ways you could have responded that don't make you sound like a mean high-schooler, but here you are. I realize you're still quite young, but it costs nothing to be civil, and the provocation here was really very small.\n\nI encourage you to consider what might be making her behave this way-- deep-seated insecurities, poor social skills, new-girl syndrome, bad prior experiences with groups of feminine girls, etc-- and consider whether your reaction was necessary. The way to make a girl like this stop is not to alienate her further, thereby reinforcing whatever negative feeling she has about girly girls, but rather to invite her in. Not saying you have to do so, but being mean to her is definitely not the way to make this go smoothly.", "This woman is almost 30 years old trying to tear down a teenager, oof.

As far as Google would tell me, a pick-me girl is a \"not like other girls\" girl who's doing it to get male attention. Considering the coworker tried to belittle OP twice when men complimented her, I'd say she's very much a pick-me. Neither \"looking good\"(\"one of the guys\" and variations thereof are featured quite frequently in the definitions) nor \"agreeing with everything\" are requirements(a pick-me would not be like \"oh, yeah, OP is totally gorgeous\" when the dude called OP pretty).", "Uhh not at a job.

They are not romantically involved but consider themselves part of the group, not dates. I am not saying being a tomboy is bad, I was always like that. But trashing gfs and alienate them is wrong. My impression for pick me's are feminine girls (in fact I am thinking that the older girl here while talking to her friends she could say \"that young girl at work is so pick me, she tries too hard with make up to make all males love her\") that they go out of their ways to please their dates or perspective dates. That is why I am saying since pick me disregard their personal opinions and want to please the \"boy\" they are careful of what they look, they are easy going (to boy-s) and they dish all other women. Here I think the other girl just dislikes OP. That gives you no right to judge someone.  And without knowing OP and spending time with them you don't know if they are a male - pleaser or just a person that loves cosmetics and feel good doing it not caring about who boys see her but just because she likes it", "Pretty normal at all the jobs I\u2019ve worked.

Telling someone their behavior toward people is shitty is not an insult. It\u2019s a fact. She didn\u2019t pick something petty or random to call out. She said her behavior was sexist, rude and immature. Because that\u2019s what a pick me is. \n\nIf a man were treating her the same way, I\u2019d expect him to be called out as sexist, rude and immature. And I\u2019d still support her for it.", "I'm not saying the coworker isn't a pick me or that she shouldn't have said anything.
