If you want to give something to them clothes... Take them with you and get it for them...\nBuy presents for Christmas/birthday but don't give money to your sister \n Honestly, \n- school uniforms: often there are second hands ones (check local Facebook, ask schools...), \n- birthday parties, you do what you can afford, it is very bad manner to expect another one to pay/just present the bill\n- it is your money, anything you give to another is a bonus to them, you don't have any obligation towards your sister\n- if you are not planning on having children yourself and want to do something special for your niece, I would open a account/ trust .. where you can put a regular amount of money for when they are older and needs money for car/studies...", "NTA.  \n\nHere\u2019s the thing. S is not your child. Anything you choose to do, spend on, spend with, and compensate is completely your choice. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d gladly give 2-300 for a nieces birthday, but as soon as my sister was demanding I spend that on the birthday I don\u2019t want to give it anymore. I\u2019m not required to fund your kids party. \n\nIt sounds like you were being a more than generous aunt already. Your sister should just pipe down and let you do your thing.", "NTA!!!\n\nShe's not your child, not your responsibility. You don't OWE your sister or your family your hard-earned and saved money and your family/sister is NOT OWED anything from you, ESPECIALLY HUNDREDS of dollars! They feel entitled to what they're asking for, but you have absolutely every right to say \"no\" and not feel guilty about it.   \n\n\n If she can't afford the basics like flea stuff or food, then maybe she shouldn't be throwing a birthday thing that costs hundreds of dollars that she can't afford because it's not up to you to pick up her slack. It is nice of you if you do, but you are not obligated to. Maybe she should throw a party within her means, for her girls. \n\nGood for you for finally realizing your boundary and asserting it! Reactions like theirs, people who no longer will get the benefits they were now that there are boundaries, are normal. I wouldn't take it too personally.", "NTA\n\nContinuing to pay for expenses outside of the birthday party will only make you an ATM. Set boundaries and have the parents handle living expenses.", "They use you for money and now you are angry because they want more money? You created this mess by giving out money like a bank. Learn how to say \"NO\" and keep saying it.", "You are NTA for creating boundaries with your very entitled sister. Honestly, her behavior is atrocious and needs to be called out. It is **not** your job to support the monetary needs of raising two children when those children aren\u2019t yours. Don\u2019t let anybody gaslight you into thinking otherwise. \n\nBut like you said, you don\u2019t want to show favoritism between your nieces and that puts you in a really difficult position. Because if you simply get S a more extravagant gift J might think you are playing favorites. And if you don\u2019t *match* the gift you got J, S could feel like you favor her sister more than her.", "NTA your sister sounds like a choosing beggar. Take the other niece to the zoo for her birthday and be done with it.", "NTA for cutting off the ATM for sister.  However, I agree with your parents that using your niece's birthday party to start is a bad idea.  The kid didn't do anything wrong.  All she'll see is that her aunt/uncle likes her sister more than her.  Ask to be sent the bill for the party, and agree to pay that.  Don't just had her a pile of cash.", "NTA. You're clearly being used. I say you tell your sister from here on out that you will only be spending a certain amount for each kid from now on for birthday and holiday gifts. Pick a number that works for you and then that's your contribution. You don't need to feel guilty for not paying for the party of a child who isn't yours.", "You\u2019re spending hundreds of \u00a3 on nieces birthdays?   Wow.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is the PARENT'S durty to pay for their kid's party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a lot less contact with your AH sinster, she is just exploiting you.", "NTA.  You need a new rule, you will *not* give your sister money for anything.  No \"helping\" with birthday costs, uniforms, or any other BS.  \n\nBuy presents for your nieces if you like, but no more cash should ever transact.t", "NTA.  Your family treats you like a piggy bank.  It is right for you to defend yourself and start saying no.\n\nI could see helping with the 2nd niece's birthday and treating her equitably. Then close the bank. If you do decide to do something for either niece, don't discuss this with anyone and don't tell anyone how much you spent.  Please get your family out of your business.", "N T A for not wanting it to continue. You would be TAH if you spend that much on one niece, and not the other for the birthday though.", "YTA. It\u2019s a bit confusing but it sounds as if you kept saying yes to your sister until you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s on you. You should give your niece exactly what you gave her sister. Don\u2019t be mean to your niece because of your inability to say no. She\u2019s a child.", "YTA. You are the only one you can control, so learn to say no and stop being guilted into this extortionate amount of money. BUT do that after contributing as much to S as you already did to J.", "Nta. Your sis is the A \n\nBut it is your niece who will suffer. Your niece  isnt responsible. \n\nMe:if i said id do something id do it. Even with a falling out. I would still fo what i said. But i would be done from that point on, period.  \n\nYou cant control what happens to you. You can control how you react to it. Karma can be both good or bad. \n\nTbh the adult thing to do would be to give money for birthday. But thats it. But others shouldnt give you a hard time for ilnot giving it either. \n\nYour sis will always try to get over on people. She is a user.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not sure how you allowed your sister to come to a point that she thinks she\u2019s entitled to your money for her kids. But she\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s up to you to stop it.  Does she work?  Why is she throwing parties she can\u2019t afford?  This is a dangerous thing to do as it puts her into financial trouble, obviously burdens others and then creates  a bad set of expectations for the kids. \n\nThat said, I would personally just try to equalize the spending on your nieces so they don\u2019t think you have favorites. I do this with my nephews, but in different ways. One of them loves cars and little gadgets. The other likes activities. So one I bought a go cart and the other I paid for the trip to an amusement park.", "NTA. You should absolutely give your niece a gift that you can afford, but your sister does not get to dictate the amount or how it would be spend. It also sounds shady enough that your sister might not end up spending the money on your niece anyway. I think declining to contribute to the party and having outings with your nieces is the way to go. That way, you make sure your nieces are the ones that use the money.", "NTA.
