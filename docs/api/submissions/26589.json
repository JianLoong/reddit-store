My daughter is just happy to have extra money to fund her Starbucks and Amazon addiction.\n\nIn August, Jenny called me. She explained that a valuable silver bracelet has gone missing from her bedroom. She claimed no one else has been in her house and she thinks Taylor has taken it, and asked if I could search Taylors things. I know I sound like a typical doting parent but I know my daughter and she wouldn't do something like that. I was shocked.\n\nI told Jenny I'd look but that Taylor is not babysitting for her again. She was angry and she said that me and my daughter are screwing her over and she doesn't have other arrangements (shes a single mother), and she called me childish names before hanging up.\n\nI later calmly explained to Taylor what happened and that I don't want her to babysit for our neighbour again, as she might accuse her of stealing other things and demand money. Taylor said I'm being controlling and that she 'needs' the money, and keeps trying to convince me that it's still a good gig.\n\nLast week Jenny texted me profusely apologising and explained that it was actually her sister who stole the bracelet and she pawned it.

Accusing your daughter of theft is serious. Yes, it sucks for your daughter and the kids - especially now that the neighbor knows she was wrong, but it\u2019s the right decision to avoid any other possible accusations.\n\nEdited to add: if she had just called to ask if your daughter knew what happened to it or had seen it\u2026that would\u2019ve been different.", "NTA\n\nShe accused your daughter of theft before doing a complete investigation of what happened.\n\nI wouldn't let my daughter babysit for that person again.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s important that there is trust when working for someone in their home and watching their kids. If Jenny\u2019s first conclusion was that Taylor stole the bracelet, I think you are correct to assume things like this could happen in the future where she blames Taylor for things being out of place.\n\nTaylor might be upset that this gig is over, but it\u2019s also better for her to find work elsewhere for someone who won\u2019t accuse her of stealing.\n\nYou\u2019re instilling values of integrity in your daughter. Your neighbor messed up what could have been a great gig.\n\nDo your best to help your daughter find a new gig though. Ultimately it\u2019s the extra money she\u2019s been earning that she\u2019s bummed about missing out on.", "NTA, the neighbor immediately blamed your daughter instead of thinking of her thief of a sister. What will she get blamed for the next time?", "NTA.  Hopefully Taylor can start babysitting for another neighbor who won't falsely accuse her of stealing.", "NTA but you are in a tough situation with your daughter being 16yrs old.  I would explain to her that this knee-jerk accusation is more than a little mistake.  It was completely disrespectful and could even be harmful.  That neighbour is an adult and should be treating people who work for her with dignity and respect.  Your daughter didn't get that, so the neighbour shouldn't get the care and trustworthy services of your daughter.", "NTA\n\nShe accused your daughter of theft with no proof whatsoever. The moment someone makes an accusation, the entire relationship changes. The idea that she would still want your daughter to babysit if she thought she was a thief either means that she's reckless with her children's safety, or she knew that your daughter hadn't done it but was hoping to get some money out of you in exchange for the bracelet.\n\nYour daughter doesn't realise the full extent of the situation she was in, so all she sees is an overprotective mother depriving her of income. Sit her down and explain that this woman was taking advantage of her by paying her less than even minimum wage, made false accusations without proof that could have tarnished your daughters reputation, especially if she went to the police, and is not a safe person to be around.\n\nCommiserate about the loss of wages. Suggest alternative ways for her to get a weekend job, or offer to help make flyers for babysitting for other people, but also explain that when people take advantage of you and make accusations, there is no going back from that. Ever. It's a valuable lesson that your daughter needs to learn as early as possible in life.", "I don\u2019t think Taylor understand the risk she\u2019s taking if she babysits for the neighbor again.", "NTA.

No!'  \nWhat person would want someone they think is a thief to enter their house again?", "This post does not make sense to me.  Why would your daughter want to return to work for someone who accused her of theft?  And why would your neighbor want to keep a thief as a babysitter?  Either both parties (Taylor & Jennie) are desperate, or some info is missing here.  However, as your post is written you are definitely NTA, and the only adult in the room.", "NTA.  You took your daughter out of a bad situation.  She is lucky she didn\u2019t realize how serious that accusation was and the repercussions that could have come from it.  Your neighbour was taking advantage of your daughter by paying her so little to begin with.", "NTA should have been dealt with so much better by the single mother. However- 16 years or not your daughter is legally allowed to work and is doing some serious work. \u00a340 a week isn\u2019t right. I think 90-100 would have been an absolute bargain, however I get it\u2019s a neighbour so a personal thing. How stupid was that woman to suggest she was a thief omg", "NTA.  Yikes!  I would not work for anyone who accused me of stealing without any evidence to suggest that I had done something wrong.  You really have to be careful about accusing someone.  Your daughter can make far more money sitting for someone else or working in a store.  She was really being taken advantage of by your neighbor.", ">I later calmly explained to Taylor what happened and that I don't want her to babysit for our neighbour again, as she might accuse her of stealing other things and demand money.

I say that as it certainly didn\u2019t take her much longer to find out her own sister stole it.  \n\nSadly your daughter is now old enough to understand that just because someone pays you doesn\u2019t make it a good job.  Especially when they accuse you of being a thief.  \n\nJenny could have asked you if you\u2019d mind checking with your daughter to see if perhaps she\u2019d seen one of Jenny\u2019s own children with the bracelet. But nope jumped right to thief.", "Why is she so excited about this job? Does your daughter not understand that she was grossly underpaid? I made more than that in the \u201880s.", "Nta but you should definitely explain exactly to your daughter why you never give someone a chance to accuse you of stealing from them twice . At the moment you\u2019re the bad guy in her eyes because all she is hearing is YOU don\u2019t want her going back over there . She probably doesn\u2019t understand fully and that\u2019s why she\u2019s mad at you . Shes 16 tell her exactly how the conversation with said neighbor went . Maybe that might click", "NAH. The neighbor handled the situation well by calling you if she thought Taylor was the thief. You also reacted well by thinking that the best solution was to stop babysitting.\n\nOn the other hand, your daughter is old enough to make her own decisions and if she wants to continue working for this neighbor, she can. Don't force her to stop, because that would be controlling. What's more, the neighbor didn't have any bad intentions and has apologized.", "Taylor is 16. Jenny has apologized. Let Taylor decide", "The neighbour falsely accused your daughter of theft. If she had gone to the Police, this would have been traumatising for your daughter. Your parents being told that you stole something, when there is no way to prove your innocence is bad enough. \n\nI cant believe that the neighbour would want your daughter to continue babysitting if she truly thought she was a thief tho. It seems more like an attempt to get someone (your daughter or you) to compensate her for the loss..\n\nNTA for protecting your daughters reputation, whatever your daughter might think.\n\nOnce the true culprit had been discovered, IF there had been an announcement that totally cleared your daughters name, AND your daughter wanted to take up the babysitting again, then that should have been your daughters decision.\n\nI must admit that personally I would refuse to ever again work for someone who had accused me of theft. But that was not your decision to make.", "NTA. But only if you fix the situation (which you can). You need to let your daughter babysit again so that you're not screwing over two people.

You were just protecting your daughter from nasty unthinking comments from someone who jumped to conclusions.\n\nPlus I used to get between \u00a35-10 an hour for babysitting 25 years ago depending on how middle class the family was.", "She's paying \u00a31.28 less than the national minimum wage for 16 Yrs. If daughter has gotten a taste of having more expendable income, OP, sit her down and show her she could be making \u00a3200 a month if she worked the same hours elsewhere. I and many others got our first jobs at 16, working the holidays and weekends. And the local supermarket would need real evidence before throwing accusations like theft around. Even if she wants to continue babysitting, enroll her on a St John's pediatric first aid course and make it clear to future clients that she has knowledge and won't accept less than minimum. \n\nShe likes her Starbucks and Amazon jollies now, but sit her down and explain that she is entitled to fair pay and a safe environment. Give her confidence that she deserves to have mutual trust at work. You're not being overbearing and not allowing her to work. You're using your knowledge as someone in the workforce, and as her mother, to say that working THERE is no longer SAFE. And it isn't, because if one of the kids decides to be a brat they can say \"she stole from me,\" or worse \"she hit me\" and that woman will believe them. Or maybe she decides she doesn't want to pay \u00a34 anymore, so some other accusation comes out (she's not doing xyz well enough,) etc. There is no trust anymore, which puts your daughter at risk.\nI had a similar issue when I was 15, and my parents stepped in.

Mom effectively took the choice away from her", "Teens can be notoriously bad at understanding consequences. I do think mom should have explained the risk of continuing this job more clearly though.
