If daughter has gotten a taste of having more expendable income, OP, sit her down and show her she could be making \u00a3200 a month if she worked the same hours elsewhere. I and many others got our first jobs at 16, working the holidays and weekends. And the local supermarket would need real evidence before throwing accusations like theft around.
