We have had issues since he realised I would keep my maiden name at work, which I informed him was none of his business and my personal choice. He works full time and his wife is a housewife. When we had our sons, Sean thought I would quit my job as a doctor and become a SAHM. However Tom became a SAHD instead and then went back to work after our son went to school and doesn't share the same thought process as Sean. Sean clearly disproves of this and me and vocalised his thoughts about the situation.\n\nI got Tom to speak to Sean and he has left us alone since, but occasionally used to make comments at holidays and birthdays about it which I ignored. They stopped when Tom returned to work and since then Tom says Sean has grown as a person. Tom and Sean are very close, and I would never tell him to stop talking to him, but I personally interact as less as possible with Sean. My sons' school and Tom's workplace is walking distance from Sean's house which is why I agreed to stay, and suck it up while we get back on our feet as it is temporary.\n\nYesterday was a very hectic day at work, and I was exhausted. My shift ended midday and I went straight to bed. Everyone was out the house; Sean and Tom went to work, the kids were at school and Sean's wife went to see a friend. Sean got home first and woke me up. I was upset and still tired and when I asked him why, he said I should make a start on dinner as it was getting late and his wife was out and not picking up her phone. Usually I do the cooking in the house with his wife, but I was upset that Sean had woken me up and yelled at him to not disturb me. I kicked him out the room and told him I was going to back sleep and he could sort out his own dinner.\n\nWhen I woke up that evening, Sean told me that while I was under his house I needed to respect his house rules. I told him he could've cooked himself, heated leftovers in the fridge or got takeaway. Tom thinks that Sean did overstep by waking me up and making demands, but I shouldn't have yelled and escalated the situation.

A fully capable adult waking up another adult to get her to make dinner for him.\n\nThat's so mind-blowingly rude and ridiculous.\n\nI really wanted to say something about how if you could have been calmer, that would have been better, but I just can't imagine how you could get pulled out of sleep and \\*calmly\\* explain to this walking anachronism that he's capable of using a microwave.\n\nYou're just 100% NTA.", "NTA and something tells me Sean has been waiting for something like this to happen for years just so he can try to \"put you in your place\", Hopefully you get the insurance sorted quickly and Sean learns to shut that dick holster he calls a mouth.", "NTA \n\nSeems to me like Sean didn't take you in out of the goodness of his heart, he took you in so he could have a second servant.", "The \"rules\" of his house are what, exactly? That while you're there you have to be his little house servant and must attend to him whenever he demands it of you? Your husband needs to step in and put a stop to this asap. You are not his brother's second wife and it's super weird that he expects you to fulfill that role. \n\nNTA.", "NTA sucks his wife was not at home to make dinner for him since that is her role. However, that is not your role and it is not your responsibility to take care of a grown ass man, even if you are staying in his house. Should you have yelled? Probably not the greatest idea. You were you 100% wrong by doing so? Absolutely not. \n\nI would look at other housing situations because this man thinks you owe him something and it will only get worse from here on out.", "NTA\n\nI'm more surprised you aren't calling him out for entering your room while you are sleeping.\n\nAlso you aren't living under his rule, you were offered space as guests.

Since Sean said he expects you to abide \"by his rules\" which apparently mean house work regardless of your work hours for the rest of your stay. And lets be honest that does not seem manageable , so there needs t be some sorting out happening. \n\nIf you were  petty you could' ve woken him up at say 4-5 am to \"start fixing up your car, since it' s clearly a man's job and you need to get to work\"  but since we' re all adults here I certainly do not recommend that.....but it' s a lovely image indeed \ud83d\ude07", "NTA.

While you might have handled it slightly better, an adult waking somebody else up to cook dinner for them is just ridiculous. I would also be angry. House rules generally refer to picking up after yourself and being respectful about using their things (reasonable), not acting as his servant. I would suggest all 4 of you sit down and sort expectations out, and if that doesnt work you may need to find other arrangements until you can return home. Just keep reminding yourself its only temporary. its only temporary.", "LOL. Sean is hilarious. I'd probably have done the same (without the yelling) and then started arrangements to stay elsewhere.

Sean can't be expecting other couples to adhere to the same standards. OP, you know what Sean is? He's just your basic misognystic, sexist AH. I think your reaction was entirely justified and he was way out of line to invade your personal space, wake you up, and demand you cook dinner for him. He's a big boy, he can cook his own meal. \n\nWhile he is technically correct in that it's his house, his rules, that doesn't mean he can impose rules that fundementally changes your lifestyle by imposing gender comforming norms. I mean, you just lost your entire house, and presumably a lot of your possessions as well. And this guy is taking this tragedy to try and impose his 1950s lifestyle onto you and Tom.\n\nNTA OP. I'd probably look into other temporary living situations. Sean sounds exhausting to live with.", "Oh hell no. NTA. You are not his wife. He can make a damn sandwich if he's so hungry.", "NTA but get your family out of there.  It\u2019s not a healthy place to be for you.", "NTA.

And he did it for a very selfish reason, not because he was worried you\u2019d ruin your sleep cycle and stay up all night. As you mentioned, there were leftovers in the house and takeout is also an option.", "Absolutely NTA. He's 40 years old he can cook his own fucking dinner. The absolute unspeakable gall for him to think just because you're in his house and a woman you are now his slave who must do his bidding as the man of the house is beyond revolting. Bad enough he thinks it's ok to treat his wife that way, but if she's good with that arrangement good for both of them I guess, but that's where the line stops. As for \"you shouldn't have yelled\" what fucking ever. He shouldn't have woken you up when you were exhausted like he's a five year old going \"Mommy I hungee when dinner?\" if he didn't want to get yelled at.", "I\u2019d say he\u2019s more so the asshole here.

But I'm leaning toward ESH.\n\nFirst OP I am so very glad you and your family were away and not injured in the house fire. THAT is the most important thing in all of this. Losing your home and all / most of the items inside had to be a traumatic experience. I hope things get sorted out with the insurance company and your family can start to rebuild your lives and find a new place to live.\n\nAnd I am 100% on your side OP about being awakened by BIL...or anyone else. I am one ill bastard when I wake up at any time. Waking me up to immediately do something, anything; is a guaranteed way to get cursed the hell out. Unless the house is on fire or terrorists have infiltrated the attic and we need to evacuate, DON'T wake me up. AND you'd just pulled a full shift at work before he woke you up? That's a total dick move to the nth degree. Doesn't matter if you're a doctor or factory worker. Far too many people don't get the sleep they should. That is dangerous on the job, and it could be deadly to your patients.\n\nHubby has probably already had several talks with his brother. And in this instance he should be letting his brother know he went too far and sticking up for you. But at the end of the day, right or wrong it is your BIL & SIL's house. If one of them were an alcoholic and you went against their wishes and brought booze into their home, THAT would be a righteous reason  for indignation. So I think most rational people would say there could be situations where \"my house, my rules\" is a justifiable stance.\n\nBUT, from the way you made it sound, he thought you should be getting dinner started for both families since his wife was at the cell phone store. You made it sound like it wasn't a case where he himself was hungry and wanted someone to fix him something. He woke you to start prepping to cook dinner instead of doing it himself. He could have called his wife to find out what was going to be for dinner and prepped or even gotten your kids to help prep for the actual cooking. (Cutting up vegetables, meat and other ingredients etc.) As far as we know BIL isn't handicapped so getting those things done could have sped things up. The idea he isn't supposed to touch a pot or pan isn't old-fashioned; it's stupid. My dad was very traditional and old school. But he got me up for school every day and made my breakfast until I graduated. (My mom was a teacher and thankfully for her never had to deal with my irritable in the morning ass.)\n\nHowever at the end of the day you have to ask where you'd be staying if not at their place? Would you all have to stay at a hotel? Not sure how home insurance works as far as that goes; but is staying there saving your family money? You've said it's more convenient for the boys. Their family IS doing your family a solid. A coworker lost everything she owned in an apartment fire a few months ago. Someone at work figured out she and her daughter were living out of her car and we passed the hat around, had a bake sale etc. to help get her back on her feet. But not everyone has that or people to take them in. You don't sound ungrateful, just rightfully irritated. The only place you're in the wrong is cursing out the person who took you in. But again I would have done the same thing for waking me up for that BS even if I was in the wrong.\n\nThe way I'd handle this moving forward is to make with or without SIL some dishes that can be put in the freezer and reheated beforehand. Lasagna, casseroles, etc. for situations when you get home too exhausted to slave over a hot stove. Everyone has to get along while you're under the same roof. My suggestion should appease BIL, provided he knows how to use a microwave, or it lets him know dinner that night won't take as long to prepare because it's already cooked. Just try to ignore what you can and coexist knowing you'll hopefully be moving out sooner than later. You two will obviously never see eye to eye on things. But cooking food ahead of time that can be heated and served quickly should be enough to get him to cool his jets.\n\nThat or buy some meats that need to be grilled. For whatever reason dudes like him tend to see that as their role even though they view standing over a stove as non-traditional. Again, glad everyone is safe and healthy above all else. This too shall pass, hang in there.\n\nEdit: Could someone explain upvotes / downvotes on Reddit please, espcially on AITA. I'm not a newbie, it's just the system doesn't make sense. I don't like BIL's stance and I think he went too far. So was my upvote correct? Or should I have downvoted because I didn't like his actions and stance. Like I'll read some post that someone has had something horrible done to them and see a ton of upvotes. Are people upvoting in support of the person or saying they got what was coming to them?", "There is a lot of context missing.
