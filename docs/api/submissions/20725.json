We have had issues since he realised I would keep my maiden name at work, which I informed him was none of his business and my personal choice. He works full time and his wife is a housewife. When we had our sons, Sean thought I would quit my job as a doctor and become a SAHM. However Tom became a SAHD instead and then went back to work after our son went to school and doesn't share the same thought process as Sean. Sean clearly disproves of this and me and vocalised his thoughts about the situation.\n\nI got Tom to speak to Sean and he has left us alone since, but occasionally used to make comments at holidays and birthdays about it which I ignored. They stopped when Tom returned to work and since then Tom says Sean has grown as a person. Tom and Sean are very close, and I would never tell him to stop talking to him, but I personally interact as less as possible with Sean. My sons' school and Tom's workplace is walking distance from Sean's house which is why I agreed to stay, and suck it up while we get back on our feet as it is temporary.\n\nYesterday was a very hectic day at work, and I was exhausted. My shift ended midday and I went straight to bed. Everyone was out the house; Sean and Tom went to work, the kids were at school and Sean's wife went to see a friend. Sean got home first and woke me up. I was upset and still tired and when I asked him why, he said I should make a start on dinner as it was getting late and his wife was out and not picking up her phone. Usually I do the cooking in the house with his wife, but I was upset that Sean had woken me up and yelled at him to not disturb me. I kicked him out the room and told him I was going to back sleep and he could sort out his own dinner.\n\nWhen I woke up that evening, Sean told me that while I was under his house I needed to respect his house rules. I told him he could've cooked himself, heated leftovers in the fridge or got takeaway. Tom thinks that Sean did overstep by waking me up and making demands, but I shouldn't have yelled and escalated the situation.

That while you're there you have to be his little house servant and must attend to him whenever he demands it of you? Your husband needs to step in and put a stop to this asap.

However, that is not your role and it is not your responsibility to take care of a grown ass man, even if you are staying in his house. Should you have yelled? Probably not the greatest idea. You were you 100% wrong by doing so? Absolutely not. \n\nI would look at other housing situations because this man thinks you owe him something and it will only get worse from here on out.", "NTA\n\nI'm more surprised you aren't calling him out for entering your room while you are sleeping.\n\nAlso you aren't living under his rule, you were offered space as guests.

Since Sean said he expects you to abide \"by his rules\" which apparently mean house work regardless of your work hours for the rest of your stay. And lets be honest that does not seem manageable , so there needs t be some sorting out happening. \n\nIf you were  petty you could' ve woken him up at say 4-5 am to \"start fixing up your car, since it' s clearly a man's job and you need to get to work\"  but since we' re all adults here I certainly do not recommend that.....but it' s a lovely image indeed \ud83d\ude07", "NTA.

While you might have handled it slightly better, an adult waking somebody else up to cook dinner for them is just ridiculous. I would also be angry. House rules generally refer to picking up after yourself and being respectful about using their things (reasonable), not acting as his servant.

Just keep reminding yourself its only temporary. its only temporary.", "LOL. Sean is hilarious. I'd probably have done the same (without the yelling) and then started arrangements to stay elsewhere.

Sean can't be expecting other couples to adhere to the same standards. OP, you know what Sean is? He's just your basic misognystic, sexist AH. I think your reaction was entirely justified and he was way out of line to invade your personal space, wake you up, and demand you cook dinner for him. He's a big boy, he can cook his own meal. \n\nWhile he is technically correct in that it's his house, his rules, that doesn't mean he can impose rules that fundementally changes your lifestyle by imposing gender comforming norms. I mean, you just lost your entire house, and presumably a lot of your possessions as well. And this guy is taking this tragedy to try and impose his 1950s lifestyle onto you and Tom.\n\nNTA OP. I'd probably look into other temporary living situations. Sean sounds exhausting to live with.", "Oh hell no. NTA. You are not his wife. He can make a damn sandwich if he's so hungry.", "NTA but get your family out of there.  It\u2019s not a healthy place to be for you.", "NTA.

And he did it for a very selfish reason, not because he was worried you\u2019d ruin your sleep cycle and stay up all night. As you mentioned, there were leftovers in the house and takeout is also an option.", "Absolutely NTA. He's 40 years old he can cook his own fucking dinner. The absolute unspeakable gall for him to think just because you're in his house and a woman you are now his slave who must do his bidding as the man of the house is beyond revolting. Bad enough he thinks it's ok to treat his wife that way, but if she's good with that arrangement good for both of them I guess, but that's where the line stops. As for \"you shouldn't have yelled\" what fucking ever. He shouldn't have woken you up when you were exhausted like he's a five year old going \"Mommy I hungee when dinner?\" if he didn't want to get yelled at.", "I\u2019d say he\u2019s more so the asshole here.

But I'm leaning toward ESH.\n\nFirst OP I am so very glad you and your family were away and not injured in the house fire. THAT is the most important thing in all of this. Losing your home and all / most of the items inside had to be a traumatic experience. I hope things get sorted out with the insurance company and your family can start to rebuild your lives and find a new place to live.\n\nAnd I am 100% on your side OP about being awakened by BIL...or anyone else. I am one ill bastard when I wake up at any time. Waking me up to immediately do something, anything; is a guaranteed way to get cursed the hell out. Unless the house is on fire or terrorists have infiltrated the attic and we need to evacuate, DON'T wake me up. AND you'd just pulled a full shift at work before he woke you up? That's a total dick move to the nth degree. Doesn't matter if you're a doctor or factory worker. Far too many people don't get the sleep they should. That is dangerous on the job, and it could be deadly to your patients.\n\nHubby has probably already had several talks with his brother. And in this instance he should be letting his brother know he went too far and sticking up for you. But at the end of the day, right or wrong it is your BIL & SIL's house. If one of them were an alcoholic and you went against their wishes and brought booze into their home, THAT would be a righteous reason  for indignation. So I think most rational people would say there could be situations where \"my house, my rules\" is a justifiable stance.\n\nBUT, from the way you made it sound, he thought you should be getting dinner started for both families since his wife was at the cell phone store. You made it sound like it wasn't a case where he himself was hungry and wanted someone to fix him something. He woke you to start prepping to cook dinner instead of doing it himself. He could have called his wife to find out what was going to be for dinner and prepped or even gotten your kids to help prep for the actual cooking. (Cutting up vegetables, meat and other ingredients etc.) As far as we know BIL isn't handicapped so getting those things done could have sped things up. The idea he isn't supposed to touch a pot or pan isn't old-fashioned; it's stupid. My dad was very traditional and old school. But he got me up for school every day and made my breakfast until I graduated. (My mom was a teacher and thankfully for her never had to deal with my irritable in the morning ass.)\n\nHowever at the end of the day you have to ask where you'd be staying if not at their place? Would you all have to stay at a hotel? Not sure how home insurance works as far as that goes; but is staying there saving your family money? You've said it's more convenient for the boys. Their family IS doing your family a solid. A coworker lost everything she owned in an apartment fire a few months ago. Someone at work figured out she and her daughter were living out of her car and we passed the hat around, had a bake sale etc. to help get her back on her feet. But not everyone has that or people to take them in. You don't sound ungrateful, just rightfully irritated. The only place you're in the wrong is cursing out the person who took you in. But again I would have done the same thing for waking me up for that BS even if I was in the wrong.\n\nThe way I'd handle this moving forward is to make with or without SIL some dishes that can be put in the freezer and reheated beforehand. Lasagna, casseroles, etc. for situations when you get home too exhausted to slave over a hot stove. Everyone has to get along while you're under the same roof. My suggestion should appease BIL, provided he knows how to use a microwave, or it lets him know dinner that night won't take as long to prepare because it's already cooked. Just try to ignore what you can and coexist knowing you'll hopefully be moving out sooner than later. You two will obviously never see eye to eye on things. But cooking food ahead of time that can be heated and served quickly should be enough to get him to cool his jets.\n\nThat or buy some meats that need to be grilled. For whatever reason dudes like him tend to see that as their role even though they view standing over a stove as non-traditional. Again, glad everyone is safe and healthy above all else. This too shall pass, hang in there.\n\nEdit: Could someone explain upvotes / downvotes on Reddit please, espcially on AITA. I'm not a newbie, it's just the system doesn't make sense. I don't like BIL's stance and I think he went too far. So was my upvote correct? Or should I have downvoted because I didn't like his actions and stance. Like I'll read some post that someone has had something horrible done to them and see a ton of upvotes. Are people upvoting in support of the person or saying they got what was coming to them?", "There is a lot of context missing.

I am, however, supporting a truly consensual dynamic where both parties are happy.", "My mother and father both work fulltime, actually my mother works more than my father as she is an RN, I would say she works way harder than him and she pays majority of the bills. \n\nThat being said, my dream is to be a SAHM raising my children, cooking homemade dinner for my family (I very much enjoy cooking and baking!) and cleaning my future home. I was never quite sure what I wanted, for awhile it was Law school, writing books, etc. As I grew up, I\u2019ve learned about myself one thing for sure: I dream to be a mother, and a great one at that. I\u2019m doing schooling online to have a degree as a backup plan and work as of now to have my own savings. But one day my world will revolve solely around my family, my garden and my home. (Possibly writing books on the side!)\n\nSo don\u2019t stereotype that every SAHM was raised under those beliefs. It is unfortunate some are pressured to believe that, but definitely not very common as the SAHM role as only now become more and more common within the last (I would say) decade. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with following traditional gender roles, as long as everyone is respected, consenting and happy. But don\u2019t paint it as a negative thing for others, and scare them away from something they may want. No one should be afraid to achieve their goal, career or no career.\n\nSean is definitely a disgusting person and disgrace to those who actually follow traditional gender roles. OP is NTA.", "It is enough :)\n\nBut since you want to be cute about, the absolute minimum they could be making a Low cost of living area is $180,000.\n\nYou are welcome cutie pie.", "Lol same", "Yea, that is not true at all. My mom had a house fire and they paid for her hotel until we could find her a house /apartment to rent. Insurance said we had a $5k/mo budget for a rental as that's what her house would rent for at market prices. I found her a place about ten miles away. \n\nHowever OP should at the very least be in a residency hotel while they look for a house to rent. Any insurance should have covered that immediately. I don't understand why they're at their brothers place at all.", "Yeah....I don't have a hotel within less than 1/2 mile from me either. In my last neighborhood, I had a friend who had a huge tree fall on their house during a big storm. Rather than putting the family up in a hotel, they found a house to lease (next door to me) right in our neighborhood.", "I usually type on my phone - and tend to cringe when I read it back because there will be spelling mistakes, or just odd words in the post.\n\nBut it's meant to be a quick post, not a dissertation. It doesn't mean I can't spell when it actually matters.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s a doctor or a gas station attendant, the point stands.", "A SAHM is also a human being *and* not a servant to be summoned at will.", "This dude ain't thinking clearly if he wants a DOCTOR to become a stay at home mom instead of the Tom quitting his job or both continuing to work. I don't know what career Tom had but it'd be idiotic for the family to give up that kind of money, especially when they have two kids to support.", "Right, Sean didn't take into account any other aspect or circumstance and completely disrespected his SIL. He is a misogynist and seems awful, tbh. I could go on and on as it pertains to this. \n\nI'm sure contributions to the household were discussed to some degree before they moved in, and OP or her husband likely would have still aided in the cooking without any type of agreement, since they are living there and have kids. But an agreement doesn't mean there's no room for flexibility or acknowledging that the conditions of our lives can make each day look a little different. An agreement doesn't mean OP or her husband will have the ability or desire to cook every day. That's expected and entirely ok because that's just part of being human. There may be days where OP doesn't contribute to dinner, and she and her husband would need to have a dinner plan separate from her in-laws so her SIL doesn't feel obligated to feed extra mouths (we already know none of the dinner arrangements would have fallen onto BIL's shoulders) . The fact her BIL didn't take into account that OP may need a break for a day or extra time to rest is concerning but not surprising. But I think we can safely assume he doesn't often consider the needs of women if those needs jeopardize his comfort and unflinching expectations  -- I doubt he offers his own wife a break from the routine and labor of household duties and childcare.", "Yes, Sean sounds like a pervy evangelical freak just waiting for an opportunity to barge in on his SIL. Even a grown ass man can order pizza all by himself.", "That\u2019s the part that got me. The person who is supposedly operating on a basis of tradition and chivalry went and invaded a woman\u2019s privacy while she slept. \n\nGender roles only when it suits his point, clearly.", "You can come to an agreement with someone. And when that agreement involves physical labor and time, and not a financial transaction, you do so with the understanding that the parameters of that agreement may necessarily need to shift -- due to scheduling, illness, work obligations, unexpected accidents or tragedies, etc.\n\nIf there happened to be an understanding that the adult guests in the house would contribute to dinner seven days a week, then BIL should have texted his brother and asked when he and SIL were going to get started on dinner. OP was very rightfully and deservedly getting some sleep. He had no reason to wake her and demand that she start cooking, and she was likely going to do so after her nap. She isn't at his beck and call and isn't obligated to attend to her BIL in anyway, which I'm sure we all realize. \n\nSidenote: An agreement to daily cooking isn't realistic, as we know, and doesn't take into account that OP and her husband may have days they want a dinner plan separate from their in-laws. They certainly wouldn't be expected to cook on days they aren't going to eat at home because they aren't live-in maids.", "\"You and your family have moved into my home for the foreseeable future, so I'd like you to take responsibility for making dinner a couple days a week\" is a reasonable request. It's reasonable to expect people to help out when they're living with you. In fact, if my in-laws moved in with me and *didn't* help out around the house, I'd think a lot less of them. \n\nThe issue isn't that OP is expected to pitch in, it's that her BIL expected her to obey him because she's a woman. He ignored the fact that he was in a better position to cook dinner (y'know, being awake and all) because he believes cooking dinner is a task that is below his station. He's not an asshole for expecting OP and her family to help out, he's an asshole for demanding that a person who worked an exhausting shift that seems to have been at least partially overnight wake up to serve him just because he doesn't respect her gender.", "The proper context would be \"a condition of you staying in my house is that you agree to handle the cooking on X nights.\" \n\nIf it had been laid out like that before the fact, OP would have had the option to agree or disagree with a specific set of terms instead of just being expected to do something because she was the woman in the house.", "Ok but that *is* the dynamic in their relationship. It is abundantly clear from how Sean treats women in his life in general that he sees his wife as subservient to him, and it is very safe to assume that goes hand in hand with an expectation that she see him as her superior.\n\nLike we're not talking about being a stay at home partner, we're talking specifically about being a subservient and inferior wife to a superior husband.\n\nBeing a stay at home partner doesn't necessarily mean subservience, but that's not what we're talking about or what I said. Being a subservient partner means subservience, very obviously, and that's what I'm saying.", "I'm not talking about being a stay at home mom though, I'm talking about being more of a \"tradwife.\" You're not describing wanting to marry a man who will be your superior and who will see you as his inferior whose job it is to be subservient to him.\n\nMany women find themselves in marriages where they believe they are effectively their husband's property and servant and their husband treats them as such, I don't think many of these women go into that freely and willingly without being groomed into it from childhood. Perhaps some do. Many more are raised to think they have no choice.\n\nEven what you describe isn't traditional gender roles, because you aren't considering your role to be one of subservience.", "You\u2019re equating being a SAHM to fully traditional gender roles, which involve subservience of women. They\u2019re not the same things. \n\nWanting to be a SAHM or wanting to be primarily devoted to the domestic sphere isn\u2019t the extent of traditional gender roles. I get why someone might want to be a SAHM and that doesn\u2019t have to be influenced by negative external pressures.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot more doubtful that someone wants to put themselves under the permanent control of someone else purely on the basis of agreeing that their gender is subservient (and not in the context of kink) and that particular desire isn\u2019t influenced by negative external pressures.", "Wow, that is a lot! And every single \"doctor\" in America no matter what they're doing makes no less than that? I'll have to let my doctor friends know. What about their current expenses, what do they currently owe on debts per month? How much did they owe on the house? How much is insurance covering? Are their kids in private or public school? What's the cost of living in their area exactly? What's the housing market like? How much do they have in savings?\n\nReally appreciate the info.\n\nEdit: figured you'd block me when you realized you couldn't get around how full of shit you are. But no, you could give a sufficient answer. Answer all the questions I asked here. You know that they can afford it, which means you don't just know their salary, you know their expenses and savings too. Weird that you don't want to tell us what they are since it'd prove your point.\n\nEdit2: sorry /u/smolpepper can't reply to you because the person I'm replying to here blocked me (hooray for Reddit's excellent site design) but I appreciate your comment. I did not know that the UK does not have expenses, debts, mortgages, homeowners insurance, private schools, costs of living, housing markets, or savings accounts. I learned something today.", "Haha yep this is me too.", "I'd say that it's more important for a doctor to be well-rested than a gas station attendant.", "Definitely not. But when classifying SAHM/SAHD as a job, more often than not, its job duties would include domestic labor like cooking. You'd still expect the adult who works outside the house to address the SAHP with appreciation and respect, but methinks \"believing in traditional gender roles\" is a euphemism for \"misogynist.\"", ">You can come to an agreement with someone.

Saving lives and counting the correct change are equally important, no?", "People are going to go on the SAHP \"is a very hard and important job\" tangent. Dude was purposely being combative, she reciprocated, he got his feelings hurt. His words would lead a sensible person to believe he wanted her out of his house. Oblige him. Take herself and her kids out of there and let the husband deal with this. It's been in the works for years it seems. OP now has the out to be rid of his little comments unless he really changes his attitude towards her. She shouldn't be walking on needles around a guy, because of his outdated role-models, ever.", "Right, an agreement is a set of conditions agreed upon. The upholding of that agreement is contingent upon a set of factors. The factors here, since this is a discussion of household labor, are people having bodies and lives that can affect the carrying out of labor. \n\nThe issue here isn't an agreement between the couples. If it was, then Sean would have asked his brother to help his wife with dinner that evening or asked any of the three other adults to order out for the group with both couples contributing to the cost. (We know that making dinner arrangements is far too complicated for Sean's archaic and daft sensibilities.) The actual issue here, because it's clearly not there being a regimented agreement that each couple contribute equally to feeding everyone living there, is that Sean expects specific labor from women and is unable to step outside of the prison of his own thinking. \n\nOP clearly communicates the issue at the heart of the encounter she's described.

Tom was the one who suggested staying at Sean's house... AND left you to do all the cooking the entire time, just so you could stay at a place that convenienced him?\n\nBig yikes. NTA, obviously. And Sean is TA, but we all know that already. The other judgement, which might be harder for you to accept, is that Tom is also kinda being an A. If he wants to stay with Sean, he should be splitting the extra work that the two of you have to do in order to stay with Sean. Instead, he's insisting on staying with Sean, while he lets YOU suffer from Sean's sexist expectations and doesn't try to even things out. \n\nI think you should just look for a short-term apartment and leave, see if insurance can cover that.

For example, if he decides to change what bank account his paycheck gets deposited into, you have zero control over that and couldn't stop him if he didn't want to be stopped.\n\nIn short, no one is (or should be) trying to shame a SAHM...but experience has taught many women that the 'happy SAHM' (or SAHD) is an extremely precarious role to play in our society. And it can cause the SAH person have an unhealthy pressure on them to make the 'breadwinner' happy at any cost, including their own happiness. In addition, even if there is absolute trust & love between the partners and there are no such abuse-like issues...there's always the 'worst happens' scenario where the breadwinner is killed or gets sick.\n\nBecause of that, I personally can't recommend the role to anyone.
