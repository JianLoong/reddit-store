We have had issues since he realised I would keep my maiden name at work, which I informed him was none of his business and my personal choice. He works full time and his wife is a housewife. When we had our sons, Sean thought I would quit my job as a doctor and become a SAHM. However Tom became a SAHD instead and then went back to work after our son went to school and doesn't share the same thought process as Sean. Sean clearly disproves of this and me and vocalised his thoughts about the situation.\n\nI got Tom to speak to Sean and he has left us alone since, but occasionally used to make comments at holidays and birthdays about it which I ignored. They stopped when Tom returned to work and since then Tom says Sean has grown as a person. Tom and Sean are very close, and I would never tell him to stop talking to him, but I personally interact as less as possible with Sean. My sons' school and Tom's workplace is walking distance from Sean's house which is why I agreed to stay, and suck it up while we get back on our feet as it is temporary.\n\nYesterday was a very hectic day at work, and I was exhausted. My shift ended midday and I went straight to bed. Everyone was out the house; Sean and Tom went to work, the kids were at school and Sean's wife went to see a friend. Sean got home first and woke me up. I was upset and still tired and when I asked him why, he said I should make a start on dinner as it was getting late and his wife was out and not picking up her phone. Usually I do the cooking in the house with his wife, but I was upset that Sean had woken me up and yelled at him to not disturb me. I kicked him out the room and told him I was going to back sleep and he could sort out his own dinner.\n\nWhen I woke up that evening, Sean told me that while I was under his house I needed to respect his house rules. I told him he could've cooked himself, heated leftovers in the fridge or got takeaway. Tom thinks that Sean did overstep by waking me up and making demands, but I shouldn't have yelled and escalated the situation.

A fully capable adult waking up another adult to get her to make dinner for him.\n\nThat's so mind-blowingly rude and ridiculous.\n\nI really wanted to say something about how if you could have been calmer, that would have been better, but I just can't imagine how you could get pulled out of sleep and \\*calmly\\* explain to this walking anachronism that he's capable of using a microwave.\n\nYou're just 100% NTA.", "NTA and something tells me Sean has been waiting for something like this to happen for years just so he can try to \"put you in your place\", Hopefully you get the insurance sorted quickly and Sean learns to shut that dick holster he calls a mouth.", "NTA \n\nSeems to me like Sean didn't take you in out of the goodness of his heart, he took you in so he could have a second servant.", "The \"rules\" of his house are what, exactly? That while you're there you have to be his little house servant and must attend to him whenever he demands it of you? Your husband needs to step in and put a stop to this asap. You are not his brother's second wife and it's super weird that he expects you to fulfill that role. \n\nNTA.", "NTA sucks his wife was not at home to make dinner for him since that is her role. However, that is not your role and it is not your responsibility to take care of a grown ass man, even if you are staying in his house. Should you have yelled? Probably not the greatest idea. You were you 100% wrong by doing so? Absolutely not. \n\nI would look at other housing situations because this man thinks you owe him something and it will only get worse from here on out.", "NTA\n\nI'm more surprised you aren't calling him out for entering your room while you are sleeping.\n\nAlso you aren't living under his rule, you were offered space as guests.

That is f'd up.", "The main issue here is not this incident, but moving forward. Since Sean said he expects you to abide \"by his rules\" which apparently mean house work regardless of your work hours for the rest of your stay. And lets be honest that does not seem manageable , so there needs t be some sorting out happening. \n\nIf you were  petty you could' ve woken him up at say 4-5 am to \"start fixing up your car, since it' s clearly a man's job and you need to get to work\"  but since we' re all adults here I certainly do not recommend that.....but it' s a lovely image indeed \ud83d\ude07", "NTA.

While you might have handled it slightly better, an adult waking somebody else up to cook dinner for them is just ridiculous. I would also be angry. House rules generally refer to picking up after yourself and being respectful about using their things (reasonable), not acting as his servant. I would suggest all 4 of you sit down and sort expectations out, and if that doesnt work you may need to find other arrangements until you can return home. Just keep reminding yourself its only temporary. its only temporary.", "LOL. Sean is hilarious. I'd probably have done the same (without the yelling) and then started arrangements to stay elsewhere.

Sean can't be expecting other couples to adhere to the same standards. OP, you know what Sean is? He's just your basic misognystic, sexist AH. I think your reaction was entirely justified and he was way out of line to invade your personal space, wake you up, and demand you cook dinner for him. He's a big boy, he can cook his own meal. \n\nWhile he is technically correct in that it's his house, his rules, that doesn't mean he can impose rules that fundementally changes your lifestyle by imposing gender comforming norms. I mean, you just lost your entire house, and presumably a lot of your possessions as well. And this guy is taking this tragedy to try and impose his 1950s lifestyle onto you and Tom.\n\nNTA OP. I'd probably look into other temporary living situations. Sean sounds exhausting to live with.", "Oh hell no. NTA. You are not his wife. He can make a damn sandwich if he's so hungry.", "NTA but get your family out of there.  It\u2019s not a healthy place to be for you.", "NTA.

And he did it for a very selfish reason, not because he was worried you\u2019d ruin your sleep cycle and stay up all night. As you mentioned, there were leftovers in the house and takeout is also an option.", "Absolutely NTA. He's 40 years old he can cook his own fucking dinner. The absolute unspeakable gall for him to think just because you're in his house and a woman you are now his slave who must do his bidding as the man of the house is beyond revolting. Bad enough he thinks it's ok to treat his wife that way, but if she's good with that arrangement good for both of them I guess, but that's where the line stops. As for \"you shouldn't have yelled\" what fucking ever. He shouldn't have woken you up when you were exhausted like he's a five year old going \"Mommy I hungee when dinner?\" if he didn't want to get yelled at.", "I\u2019d say he\u2019s more so the asshole here.
