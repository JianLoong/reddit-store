If she was really that concerned that two of her friends would be eating something different, she could\u2019ve went out to get more lamb or ordered takeout for all of her friends to share. \n\nOr maybe she could\u2019ve just told them you already started cooking so they\u2019d have a different stew instead. I doubt they\u2019d care. Either way, she\u2019s the asshole.", "You know what\u2019s even more rude? Instead of thanking you and understanding where you coming from, she is saying you\u2019re a bad person. Where was she during all these? Why can\u2019t she go buy that lamb and cook them herself. They are her friends. NTA", "NTA \n\nYou did what you could on short notice, really the shortest notice you can have while still having notice. \n\nBTW, did your wife offer to go to the store and get more lamb when she invited more people when you were already cooking? Because to me she sounds like the rude one in this story, and I doubt the other guests complained about someone hosting them and making them dinner on super short notice.\n\nFFS you made two stews for one meal! Your effort here was A+. She has no business complaining.", "I don't know what's the big deal to just say \"I didn't have enough lamb to go around so I made some chicken too - feel free to share\"... put it all in the center of the table and let them decide who eats what.", "NTA. One accommodates last minute guests as best one can. It would have been ideal if you had run to the supermarket, but it's perfectly acceptable to make do under the circumstances.", "Nta lamb is fucking expensive", "NTA you already started cooking, your wife needs to learn to be more considerate to your limitations, you are not her personal chef on call 24/7.", "NTA never cook again for her guest they can order pizza", "NTA- it was a case of let\u2019s do what I can to feed everyone not a case of feed these ppl this instead of that..", "NTA\n\nYour wife gave you ZERO time to prepare for the extra guests. She wants to talk rude? It's rude to screw over your SO and then make them feel bad about not having enough food.", "NTA. You don\u2019t add more guests to the mix after food has been decided and is in the process of being cooked. She pulled the AH move.", "NTA. If she wanted to keep adding people, she should have cooked.", "NTA \n\nI think you might have made a typo... it says 'wife' but you must have meant 'head chef at the restaurant you're employed at', because otherwise it doesn't make any sense that she'd be demanding that you make last minute adjustments and trips to the shops because *she'd* invited more people than originally planned.", "NTA why couldn't she tell you beforehand? Or take her bum to the store when she sprung the news on you when you already started cooking? Don't let her guilt you.", "NTA.\n\nIn my corner of the world, the host usually sacrifices, so maybe (I know it\u2019s borderline ridiculous) you and your wife should\u2019ve eaten the chicken stew. But since she was hosting the party/reunion, that should\u2019ve been her call, not yours.", "NTA\n\nHowever, you could've just added the chicken to the lamb stew dish. It's such a bland meat it would've just absorbed the other tastes.", "NTA\n\nYOUR WIFE should have ran to the store after informing you of the additional uninvited guests she decided to include.\n\nYOUR WIFE should have made sure she disccused inviting more and more people before you starting cooking so you could have enough food for all.\n\nYOUR WIFE should have spoken to you before everything if she already KNEW they were coming and decided to blindside you at the lat minute.", "NTA You we\u2019re cooking and adjusting to a sudden change. Your wife should be grateful for that. If she wanted her last minute guests to have particular food, she should have taken care of it.", "This has to be fake. If not, your wife is on another planet.", "NTA. If she was available, you probably should've sent her. You were cooking already and should've been focusing on the food. I know you prob had times it had to sit to cook, but leaving it unattended is a big no.\n\nNot that it matters, but as a picky eater, i would've preferred the chicken anyway, lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Would it not be more reasonable to split lamb and chicken so that everyone gets bit of lamb?", "NTA\n\nI just realized the numbers work out so that you and your wife should have eaten the chicken while serving the lamb to all of your guests.", "Why didnt she run and get more lamb? Nta, get better wife.", "Put both pots on the table and let people choose.", "ESH. Changing the plans last minute was crummy, but your solution seems pretty passive aggressive.", "Soft YTA because when you cook for other people you make more than you need to accommodate for seconds / big appetites and leftovers. If you had done that you could have made it work with bread etc. But she should have given you more notice or gone to get the lamb herself.", "INFO: You, your wife and her 3 friends, that makes 5 portion of lamb stew. Two friends arrive, you make 2 portion of chicken stew. Wouldn't it have been possible for you and your wife to take the chicken stew and give the lamb stew for her friends ?", "NTA Such short notice and you accommodated. Lamb is not better than chicken to me ; )", "You and your wife can have chicken stew.\n\nNot buying more lamb was weird, but not AH weird.\n\nNTA.", "NTA because she increased the number when it was too late to accommodate them, but I would have made an additional side dish with those extra ingredients you did have paired with just a slightly smaller portion of stew for everyone.", "Maybe it's a cultural difference, but where I come from when you invite 3 people over, you cook for 6, so there are seconds and extra. \n\nI'll go with NTA because maybe it's done differently in your corner of the world. Either way, when different dishes are made in this case, chicken, lamb, and fish, you just put it in the centre and let people serve themselves.", "And that's not even the problem here.", "Not really, I know a lot of people who'd go running to the shop for more of the same that was already being cooked. That said, it could also have been resolved with chucking some extra veggies in the stew (which OP had, because he had them to make the chicken) and scrabbling together an extra side dish from what else they had (usually doable). OR serve both in big dishes at the table for people to help themselves to both and explain there's two because of the last-minute extra guests but help yourself (quite a few people prefer chicken over lamb anyway). \n\nOP is obviously NTA and wife is off with this one but it also likely wasn't that problematic to resolve equally either.", "My wife and I didn\u2019t eat any of the lamb; we had mackerels. We\u2019d let the friends have that but they don\u2019t like it.", "I think it\u2019s weird to assume everyone wants the same thing. Literally central bowls and help yourself, and if the lamb happens to run out and any of the guests pull an \u201cew, you only have chicken left\u201d, you can show them the preferred door or window you\u2019d like them to leave through.", "Why should op miss out on the lamb stew because his wife was rude and added two more guests on at the last minute?", "I made 3 portions of lamb for her 3 friends and mackerel for myself and wife. The additional 2 friends don\u2019t like mackerel.", "Yea that's what I would have done personally.", "It just feels like proper etiquette and less weird.", "Normally I would agree but I feel like proper etiquette went out the window with such last minute invites."]}
