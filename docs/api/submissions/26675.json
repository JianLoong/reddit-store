And seems like her way of gaining a relationship with her kids is by talking shit about the other ones for each one of them. Pretty sure your other sibling receive similar calls, best exemple being your sister calling you immidiately afterwards. \n\nI would not feed into that. You don't need to be part of that negative energy. Your therapist should get a raise lol he's telling you what's right. You have the right to have your boundaries with her and let her know you feel uncomfortable as she is the one who made this relationship uncomfortable. Apologizing does not erase the past.

They should know that you will only communicate with them if they have an important reason to call or text you. You will not allow them to use that opportunity to bully you or say hateful things to you and doing so will result in a blocking. It also would probably be a good idea to have your wife block their numbers for the time being. If they have anything to say, they should only go through you.  I'm glad that your in-laws are able to offer you a chance to experience what a healthy family dynamic is like. I'm sorry you didn't have that as a child.", "NTA.

Some people think just because they end up with a life threatening illness that everything will be forgotten.  No, it happened and cancer doesn\u2019t make the pain go away, those scars are lasting.  \n\nMy mom was the worst so I get it.  She thought it would all be forgive and forget when she received her diagnosis.  Nope, my brothers can do no wrong no matter what they do.  I\u2019m the bad child because I live 20 minutes away and don\u2019t jump to her beck and call.  Mind you they both live several states away on purpose.  We are LC but we also have situations in our past we don\u2019t discuss at all.  She has tried to bring issues up with her version mind you, in front of her friends to get sympathy.  I let it go until I just can\u2019t.  My specific words are do you really want me to round out the picture?  I can with all the details.  She rapidly changes the subject.

Your mom is clearly still in the \"it's all about me\" stage of life. She's taught her favorite daughter the same manipulative tricks. If you DO spend time with her, make sure you set very low expectations on the visit. It's probably going to be mostly about what you can do for her. That will mostly likely include what money you can give her.\n\nIf you DO decide to give her any, make sure it's for bill payment and send the money directly to the place she owes money to, not her. People can use things like being sick as a way to extort money they wouldn't get otherwise.\n\nI'm being this harsh because people who are like this rarely change.

I'm sorry your mom treated you this way growing up. It wasn't right and it was 100% within your mom's control to do better by you. You deserved better. Now that she's sick and looking to make amends & include you in her life, she needs to learn to accept that forgiveness doesn't happen right away, if it ever happens at all.

You are not in except when they want something from you.\n\nGive your mom only what you want to give (see her when you want to; don't when you don't). Don't bother explaining yourself to her or your sisters. They will twist it whatever way they want to.

But it should come from your heart, no input from wife. I only say because once you lose a parent, it can make you second guess a lot. Even if you just start to wonder what if I tried to reconnect/forgive or whatever then what wife says is stuck in your head, can make you a little resentful. Im not saying your wife is wrong or that she shouldn't have an opinion, just make sure it boils down to you.", "NTA.  My rule with my own shitty mother is to do whatever lets me sleep at night, because she will never be happy with what I give her.

That may not seem like a big deal but it really is. See, when a person is put in a position of having to face their own mortality, a lot of the time that person also turns to faith and religion. Which means the ever famous \"answering for wrongs, facing their Maker\". Mom is trying now because she wants a clean slate, she made it right in the end. But there is no going back and getting a do over to make it right. It is not like making a quilt and realizing you stitched this piece in backwards. You can't take the stitches out of life to flip the past. It's set in stone. Now if mom had reached out before this, I might be inclined to say give her a chance.

That's 100% what your sister dumped on you. \n\nAs you well know, \"I need it\" plus maybe some BS promises of repayment is \"reason enough\" for your self centered abusive mom to expect her target to fall in line and cough up what she demands. You have a lifetime of experience knowing your mom sees you as a resource and not as the child you were, nor the person you are now. She, like many abusers, wants her image of how you \"should\" be: compliant, obsequious, convenient and undemanding, to be accepted and adhered to. That's where her blaming and shaming efforts come from. \n\nYour in-laws seem like healthy people who respect boundaries and respond to openess and vulnerability with acceptance, validation and support. What's not to love and appreciate there?\n\nYour abusive relatives trying to create a contest or fairness requirement limiting your \"right\" to set appropriate boundaries with every relationship as warranted because \"If you give them that, we deserve equal that from you\" continues the pattern of invalidating and negating your needs and healthy boundaries so they can strip you of your savings and leave you bereft and alone. They not only don't care about supporting you as a person, they get a thrill of power by accessing your resources to your detriment.\n\nYou aren't preferring one set of in laws over the other in an \"everything being equal\" scenario. You are CHOOSING to devote your limited time, energy and resources on people and interactions that support YOUR priorities, goals, needs and vulnerabilities. You are chosing NOT to spend time and energy on people who invalidate your priorities and boundaries and have proved to be abusive.\n\nIt's normal to feel a range of emotions all the time. They wax and wane. They can be overwhelming and confusing, distressing at times. ALL of that is okay. Okay to feel. Okay to be affected by that process. Okay to need time and space to process, come to understand and then decide what actions you will take. \n\nYou seem to be on a good path. It's okay to limit your interaction with toxic forces in your life.

She doesn\u2019t get to be the mean mom, and the nice mom. She chose to be cruel to you for years, and then decided suddenly that she wanted to be nice to you when she needed a surgery that would help save her life? Is this something related to money maybe? She doesn\u2019t get to be the favorite or the prioritized after how she treated you.", "NTA\n\nYour mother it seems made it pretty clear to you were last the last priority when it came to caring for eight children. \n\nNow that apparently she might need someone she apparently decided you might be the best choice as in you have money and likely a house/home where she could stay to be taken care of. \n\nNope. \n\nYour mother doesn\u2019t get to try to now be \u2018oh love you do much\u2019 because now she might need you.  She can rely on her daughter that still lives at home on her phone or any of the other 6 children including the one who called you. \n\nSounds harsh but she made this particular bed so she can lie in it.", "NTA i agree with your wife don't worry about it.", "In my little cynical heart it seems like your mom wants something and is buttering you up first acting like she cares.", "NTA \n\nYour mom never prioritized you, so why should you do that for her now? It\u2019s *her* fault that she has to rely on the siblings who failed to launch.", "NTA \n\nHer disease has nothing to do with you. You are not responsible for her illness. Your sister can go kick rocks. Being sick is not an excuse for anything.", "Your mom owes you an apology. A sincere apology with no expectations that you will accept it but understanding you may reject it. Her near death experience/realization of mortal existence is not an excuse to \"forget\" how she treated you and for her to assume her attempts at being a mom now are good enough. \n\nNTA for how you feel and respond in kind to how you've been treated by her. And \"F\" anyone (siblings included) who try to gloss over how you have been treated by your mom just because she's sick now.", "NTA", "Yay! therapy!, \"mom's an adult who can manage her own feelings and I'm not responsible for them.\" Those are therapist words ; )\n\nNo, you're not an AH. Your mom treated you poorly. I wouldn't really care about her either. Ironically, I'd be more pissed she told me about her health problems. Like, Oh now you need my help, now you love me! Tell your siblings if they give so much of shit they can help.", "I can totally relate to this! I didn't start to \"realize\" how crappy my mom really was too until I was married and met my very sweet and kind in laws. My MIL alone makes my mom look like a wicked witch. So generous and caring we can call her for help with anything. My mom just can't be bothered. Smh. NTA of course.", "NTA favoritism is gross.", "NTA - Actions have consequences.  Your siblings and mother are attempting to erase your mother\u2019s behaviour towards you.  I\u2019ll bet they are attempting to soften your feelings in order to ask you for financial support of some type.", "OP. Lots of people have given you good answers. I am wondering about your mums illness.\n\nIs it malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or basal cell carcinoma (BCC)? They are all skin cancers and have wildly different outcomes regardless of margins. \n\nIf it is melanoma, then it may be a genuine risk to life and they will treat aggressively taking very wide and deep margins and distant spread is a real possibility. It is hard to treat. However, if it is a BCC, she is hugely exaggerating and it will be cut out and that is it, the cancer is gone. It can come back in different areas (but they get zapped or frozen and don\u2019t spread around the body. It isn\u2019t life limiting.) SCC is a bit more aggressive but nowhere near melanoma. Deeper, wider margins than BCC are taken and surgery is usually curative. It can spread locally but it\u2019s incredibly rare for it to be a life limiting or to spread to other parts of the body. I\u2019ve never come across a patient who has had distant spread or it was cause of death. I have seen some nasty local spreads (spread out from original cancer) and very occasionally to local lymph nodes. Basically, unless it is a melanoma, she is exaggerating the severity of her cancer. \n\nYour mum sounds manipulative. I just thought you should be aware that she may be exaggerating her illness to put pressure on you.", "NTA. I believe that everything you feel and believe in this situation is right. And I think that you have handled it very well. You remind me of a therapist the way you have pragmatically explained this situation! \n\nI am very happy that you have found a family that cherishes and respects you. I hope that through your wife\u2019s parents, you are getting to make up for the parent relationship that you missed. Not having that relationship can fuck you up a bit. \n\nAnd kudos to your wife. I\u2019ve been in a similar position to her and been really frustrated by my partner\u2019s parents and wanted to stand up to them or defend him, but it\u2019s your relationship and your choice. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong for you to want to keep a relationship with your family, as long as it is not self-destructive to you.", "NTA. If anything happens to Mom it's cancer.", "NTA Seems like all your mom does is complain about or attack her own kids. You do not owe her anything.", "NTA. Tell your little sister to stfu. I know in her mind she is sticking up for her mom and that\u2019s great. However, you don\u2019t have that relationship with your mother. You were mistreated and it sounds like you both never had a conversation about that and she never apologized and now that she\u2019s sick wants to pretend it never happened. It doesn\u2019t work that way.", "NTA, I feel like you should be blunt and skip the \"sorry I didn't mean it like that\". Tell your family/mom you were never put first, kicked out at 16, made to pay rent when older siblings weren't, can they really be surprised that you aren't going to put them first over your wife and her family who have treated you better.\nJust say or text that every time someone tries to guilt you.", "You are already doing a wonderful, kind thing for your mother by giving her a chance to reconnect.  That does NOT mean you need to be a doormat.  You can be kind and still be realistic and protective of yourself.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Sick people trying to alleviate their guilt don\u2019t deserve forgiveness. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I had a mother like yours. Probably still do, haven't checked in a bit. Listen to your wife.", "Being sick doesn\u2019t make up for piss-poor parenting, in the same way that dying doesn\u2019t make a piss-poor person a saint. Your mother isn\u2019t absolved of her behavior towards you just because she\u2019s ill. NTA", "NTA. Your wife makes sense. Continue listening to her.", "Your wife and in-laws are your family now. I\u2019m so glad you have them and obviously a great therapist too. Your mom has 7 other kids to bother, she can lose your number. She treated you horribly and she can\u2019t take that back. You don\u2019t need her negativity in your life plus you can\u2019t trust her motives. Your sister is annoying, it\u2019s ok to block them both. NTA", "NTA.", "stole it straight from my wife lol", "NTA, little sister can go eat a poo laden egg.", "Most of the time we don't see that the parent is trying to repair the relationship, but rather they just aren't getting enough attention from a specific child or children. It would be nice if illness made people wiser and gave them a better view of their own life, but most of the time it just makes them needier.\n\nI come from a NPD plus physical abuse household. Something about coming from an NPD household draws other people who came from an NPD household to you. For instance, my sister married a wonderful man who also comes from an NPD household.  Old age and illness has not made a single one of my group's parents into a better person in any way shape or form.", "Your wife may be biased, but her reply to that was right on.", "As Ivan Drago once said : *If she dies, she dies*", "I would pay to see the sister's honest unfiltered reaction reading this comment. Truly a beauty.", "Right?  Pack your bags, you\u2019re going on a guilt trip!", "Absolutely.  And if you are going to maintain contact, you can absolutely set boundaries and stick to them.  You can tell her you won\u2019t listen to her complain about your siblings, that you\u2019ll set the schedule when you see her, that you won\u2019t celebrate holidays with her, etc.", "She might or might not be interested in improving the relationship.

She's more physically fit then some of my siblings.", "My grandma is 106 and doesn\u2019t carry on like this. SMH.", "So unless people are as old as your mom, they cannot be old or sick.

That's why he's been treated worse & expected to put up with it.", "The term \u201cMom\u201d is one of affection. \n\nOP\u2019s mother hasn\u2019t earned the respect, love it being deserved of being called \u201cMom\u201d.", "It's easy to say that a grudge isn't healthy when you have no clue as to what hardships responsibilities OP might have had growing up aside from this post . This type of filial respect towards parents goes out the window where there has been open favoritism/neglect throughout their life.", "partially agreed. its almost like he had to line read to throw it at her. he can hold a grudge, but the way he said it was unexpected and totally unnecessary to the conversation. i dont think you should use anybody as a verbal punching bag, especially over the phone. maybe saying that gave him some relief, confidence, justice, etc, but it doesnt mean youre NTA for saying. YTA but for a good reason (for yourself at least)", "Turning your back on people who have mistreated you is not \"holding a grudge,\" nobody gets credit from their kids just for having them.", "Your wife is a smart lady.", "Doesn't sound like you stole it.

Good for you.", "I can why you married her.", "Nah she only be nice to you because she need someone to pay for her medical bills", "I\u2019m so happy you married her. Finally someone who is team YOU. \n\nNTA and your little sister can butt out of it.", "continue to prioritize the people who will 100% prioritize you as well. too bad, so sad, mom. if the guilt continues, you know your wife will support you going no contact. you don't need that in your life, especially if your mom made your life, specifically, hell.", "Listen to your wife. Is she looking for online friends? We could bond over our terrible MILs!", "You\u2019re under no obligation to forgive someone because they apologise - not that she has apologised. She was the adult and she chose how your relationship was. Making a child feel unloved is a terrible thing to do.", "what is NPD???", "LOL  She is so milking this.  Also, little bits of skin cancer is normal for that age group.  Those guys were putting baby oil on their skin to tan in the summers back in the day.", "No, that's not what I said.", "Whatever the terminology it doesn't take the place that she's his parent. And she hasn't earned it. So give her the chance too.", "Actually,  psychiatrists do say that people can move on without forgiving. OP doesn't owe his mom a single dime.\nShe has never been a mother anyway. \nBut I'd say that OP should make a clean break and completely Blick off that toxic limb, for his and his real family's sake", "Me 2! I interpret this differently. OP your Mom had a cancer diagnosis and it was not a 100% success. When people are diagnosed with life threatening illnesses they begin to look at their life and their mistakes, they have regrets. She knows she did you wrong because she had to take a good hard and long look at her life.\n\nThe reality is that she is looking to make amends now and is silently asking for your forgiveness. The thing with forgiveness it is more for the person asking for it then you. She wants to be forgiven because she is sitting with guilt.\n\nYour next step is on you. You have made peace with your past and moved onto your next best chapter. The family you may have wished for is now yours. Just because your Mom gave birth to you does not make her your Mother.

Narcissistic personality disorder.", "Also. Most skin cancer removals are done under local anesthesia unless they\u2019re in a particularly difficult area. \n\nI had melanoma was on my scalp and the removal process was fairly involved, so I did have to be fully sedated. But because of my medical history, there have been several skin lesions where my doctor has said \u201cif it were anybody else, I wouldn\u2019t be worried, but with your history, I think we should remove it.\u201d So I\u2019ve had like, 4 more dermatology surgeries since then and they were all done in the doctor\u2019s office under local anesthesia.

May I add that you don't have to forgive her to move on. It's totally up to you. You seem happy with a wonderful wife and loving in laws, cherish them and the old hag can use her guilt to make peace with herself.
