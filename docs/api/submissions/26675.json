And seems like her way of gaining a relationship with her kids is by talking shit about the other ones for each one of them. Pretty sure your other sibling receive similar calls, best exemple being your sister calling you immidiately afterwards. \n\nI would not feed into that. You don't need to be part of that negative energy. Your therapist should get a raise lol he's telling you what's right. You have the right to have your boundaries with her and let her know you feel uncomfortable as she is the one who made this relationship uncomfortable. Apologizing does not erase the past.

I would prioritize my in-laws too with a mother like that. She kicked you out at the age of 16. What a mom.", "Nta.  I would talk to sister tho and explain that you had a different mom than she did.

It probably would be a good idea to go either low or NC with your mom and sisters until you've had time to process all of this and figure out where they stand in your life at this time. They should know that you will only communicate with them if they have an important reason to call or text you. You will not allow them to use that opportunity to bully you or say hateful things to you and doing so will result in a blocking. It also would probably be a good idea to have your wife block their numbers for the time being. If they have anything to say, they should only go through you.  I'm glad that your in-laws are able to offer you a chance to experience what a healthy family dynamic is like. I'm sorry you didn't have that as a child.", "NTA.

I can only assume that they treat you like family, just not your family.  Not everyone has the typical home life some have it just awful.  Not everyone on the outside can see it but those who truly love you will and they will protect you from that pain.  \n\nI\u2019m going to get hate here, but just because she now has cancer doesn\u2019t absolve her for being a crappy parent/human.  Some people think just because they end up with a life threatening illness that everything will be forgotten.  No, it happened and cancer doesn\u2019t make the pain go away, those scars are lasting.  \n\nMy mom was the worst so I get it.  She thought it would all be forgive and forget when she received her diagnosis.  Nope, my brothers can do no wrong no matter what they do.  I\u2019m the bad child because I live 20 minutes away and don\u2019t jump to her beck and call.  Mind you they both live several states away on purpose.  We are LC but we also have situations in our past we don\u2019t discuss at all.  She has tried to bring issues up with her version mind you, in front of her friends to get sympathy.  I let it go until I just can\u2019t.  My specific words are do you really want me to round out the picture?  I can with all the details.  She rapidly changes the subject.

Your mom is clearly still in the \"it's all about me\" stage of life. She's taught her favorite daughter the same manipulative tricks. If you DO spend time with her, make sure you set very low expectations on the visit. It's probably going to be mostly about what you can do for her. That will mostly likely include what money you can give her.\n\nIf you DO decide to give her any, make sure it's for bill payment and send the money directly to the place she owes money to, not her. People can use things like being sick as a way to extort money they wouldn't get otherwise.\n\nI'm being this harsh because people who are like this rarely change. You're right to guard your feelings. If you can, talk this over with your therapist as a check and as a way to emotionally prepare for spending time with your family. That visit will likely bring up a whole host of old feelings even if it goes well.", "NTA\n\nBeing a bad parent happens, continuing the trend is not ok.

If you want to be loved and cared for when you're sick, you should maybe try this revolutionary new thing called being a decent person when you're healthy.", "NTA. I'm sorry your mom treated you this way growing up. It wasn't right and it was 100% within your mom's control to do better by you. You deserved better. Now that she's sick and looking to make amends & include you in her life, she needs to learn to accept that forgiveness doesn't happen right away, if it ever happens at all. She made it clear that you were never her top priority and she can't now demand to be yours. I'm happy that you have a supportive wife and good in-laws.", "Ugh. NTA.\n\nYour mom and sisters (it seems to be a gender thing - and I say this as a woman) have their own little happy club. You are not in except when they want something from you.\n\nGive your mom only what you want to give (see her when you want to; don't when you don't). Don't bother explaining yourself to her or your sisters. They will twist it whatever way they want to. Your mom wanting to repair her relationship with you does NOT translate into you being obligated to make her happy. It is up to her to do what she can (e.g., listen to and HEAR you), not up to you to satisfy her wishes - even if she does have a serious health scare.", "Nta. I absolutely 100% agree. But it should come from your heart, no input from wife. I only say because once you lose a parent, it can make you second guess a lot. Even if you just start to wonder what if I tried to reconnect/forgive or whatever then what wife says is stuck in your head, can make you a little resentful. Im not saying your wife is wrong or that she shouldn't have an opinion, just make sure it boils down to you.", "NTA.  My rule with my own shitty mother is to do whatever lets me sleep at night, because she will never be happy with what I give her.  Unsurprisingly, what lets me sleep at night is doing very little beyond texting on major holidays to make sure she\u2019s still in the land of the living.", "So mom is trying to make amends AFTER getting cancer and not before? That may not seem like a big deal but it really is. See, when a person is put in a position of having to face their own mortality, a lot of the time that person also turns to faith and religion. Which means the ever famous \"answering for wrongs, facing their Maker\". Mom is trying now because she wants a clean slate, she made it right in the end. But there is no going back and getting a do over to make it right. It is not like making a quilt and realizing you stitched this piece in backwards. You can't take the stitches out of life to flip the past. It's set in stone. Now if mom had reached out before this, I might be inclined to say give her a chance. But be honest, if she wasn't facing her own mortality, would she be trying now? That is really what it comes down to. \n\nNTA", "I'm with your wife.

That is I hope you don't love someone who treated you that way, because your love is wasted and certainly not returned.", "YTA. It's your mom. Your in-laws are to be looked at as your second family, or like roommates in terms of the value scale. The moment you divorce your wife, they're gone.

NTA", "YTA - don't get me wrong, it's justified assholery, but it was still a not very nice thing to say and I don't think her question was unreasonable and you could've answered in a better way.

That's 100% what your sister dumped on you. \n\nAs you well know, \"I need it\" plus maybe some BS promises of repayment is \"reason enough\" for your self centered abusive mom to expect her target to fall in line and cough up what she demands. You have a lifetime of experience knowing your mom sees you as a resource and not as the child you were, nor the person you are now. She, like many abusers, wants her image of how you \"should\" be: compliant, obsequious, convenient and undemanding, to be accepted and adhered to. That's where her blaming and shaming efforts come from. \n\nYour in-laws seem like healthy people who respect boundaries and respond to openess and vulnerability with acceptance, validation and support. What's not to love and appreciate there?\n\nYour abusive relatives trying to create a contest or fairness requirement limiting your \"right\" to set appropriate boundaries with every relationship as warranted because \"If you give them that, we deserve equal that from you\" continues the pattern of invalidating and negating your needs and healthy boundaries so they can strip you of your savings and leave you bereft and alone. They not only don't care about supporting you as a person, they get a thrill of power by accessing your resources to your detriment.\n\nYou aren't preferring one set of in laws over the other in an \"everything being equal\" scenario. You are CHOOSING to devote your limited time, energy and resources on people and interactions that support YOUR priorities, goals, needs and vulnerabilities. You are chosing NOT to spend time and energy on people who invalidate your priorities and boundaries and have proved to be abusive.\n\nIt's normal to feel a range of emotions all the time. They wax and wane. They can be overwhelming and confusing, distressing at times. ALL of that is okay. Okay to feel. Okay to be affected by that process. Okay to need time and space to process, come to understand and then decide what actions you will take. \n\nYou seem to be on a good path. It's okay to limit your interaction with toxic forces in your life.

Most others, keep pushing some stupid narrative because like you OP, my mom stopped being a mom years ago. Where has she been? I don't call her for advice. I don't call her because I don't miss her. \n\nOnce, I needed a minor surgery and I had no one to care for me. The same aunt to tried to loop me in recently was the ONLY relative who called and told me \"If you need a ride, I can take the day off work to help you, just let me know ok?\".  I cried for 3 hours. My own mother who knew from the grapevine radio silence. \n\nYour in laws and wife are there for you. Not her. Not until she feared karma/beyond death her actions deep down she knows. Same as my mom. My younger sibling poor thing, asked me if demons and ghosts are real. I said why? They said mom says she sees things. I assured my sibling she sure should, staring down death's door knowing deep deep down what fucked up shit she had done. Same old same old, just trying to save her own skin, again---by using \"me\" or in this case I guess her soul.\n\nSorry OP I deterred a bit there, but people just don't know. They don't have a point of reference how abandoned you feel. They try to sympathize but some just are unable to. \n\nI got a younger sibling and their experience with our mom was better, but not like mine.\n\nStay strong.

You didn't choose to be brought into the world, and yet here you are.  If your mother didn't want to prioritize you while you were under her care when you didn't really have a choice but to live with that, why would she expect you to prioritize you when she wants the reverse and you do have the choice?  To be fair I know we both know the answer to that question, but you responded like a boss :).  Actions, meet consequences - if you don't like the consequences, don't do the actions.

The guilt that you can experience from others and worse, place against yourself needs to be addressed. If something were to happen to her, then that is just happened.

Take it from experience, it isn't.  It's part of basic human nature that we want catharsis,  we want closure,  and permanently shutting the door to that is really hard,  because we all live in hope.  My mother is married to someone who abused me horribly,  but because I do love her,  a part of me will always hope that one day she'll choose me,  even if my rational mind knows the odds are just barely above zero. But that little bit of hope that won't die makes it so hard to just permanently shut that door and stick to it. It's not your place to judge someone for not being able or willing to do that. Yeah,  what he said was hurtful, we are imperfect creatures. He should probably apologize,  but only for his wording.", "Also I wanted to say that this is all easier said than done. You may not be ready to forgive her.

She wants to be forgiven because she is sitting with guilt.\n\nI don't like this as a general model of forgiveness. It seems to characterize forgiveness as just something to help the guilty party feel better.\n\nIMO real forgiveness has to be something you do for yourself. You forgive someone not to make *them* feel better, but to help yourself feel better and move on. You are letting go of your anger and resentment because they are no longer helpful for you.\n\nThe thing to keep in mind is that forgiveness is never an obligation. It is always a choice, and it has to be something that you do for yourself. If you forgive someone just because they make you feel guilty then the resentment doesn't go away, it just gets buried.", "Forgiveness, real forgiveness, is a rare and special thing. It requires an honest accounting of the acts or omissions that require forgiveness, which includes acknowledging that they were wrong. It requires some measure of penance, effort to make it as right as possible. And even then it is not guaranteed. Not everyone is built to seek real forgiveness. \n\nOP's mom is not seeking forgiveness. She hasn't acknowledged her wrong and she hasn't asked for forgiveness.  She isn't doing much to try to make amends for her past wrongs. \n\nWhat she is doing is an effort to not add new wrongs to the pile. That's good, but in these circumstances insufficient. She doesn't get to be top priority just because she is hurting OP less than she used to.", "Silently asking for forgiveness doesn't count.

It is more like they are a stranger who you are indifferent to, not actively hating them or thinking ill about them but also with absolutely no intention in being in contact with them (because you did not forget that they showed you their true colors and you are not interested in drama).", "You can let go of anger and resentment without forgiving the person who inflicted the pain that caused them.
