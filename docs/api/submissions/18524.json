If you had the texts etc in writing, it should not be a problem with the landlord as it was not the actual people renting the apartment doing the fraud. There have been many instances of people using unsuspecting 3rd party peoples addresses for fraud, it is not those peoples fault, but a nasty scheme.", "Who do you imagine she had defrauded?", "Slight Y T A for not giving her time to fix it first, but NTA for protecting yourself and your home.", "10/10", "Yeah, seems very over-the-top, although I get the concern.

You\u2019ve libeled and slandered this person by telling everyone she is a fraudster based on your non-understanding of LLC and principal place of business meaning.\n\nThe registered address of an LLC is it\u2019s principal place of business, the location where records are kept OR it\u2019s registered agent is located for purposes of correspondence, receipt of service, county of suit, and possible county for tax purposes. It does not mean the business transacts any business at that address or that a store is located there. A single address can have hundreds of businesses registered to it, that doesn\u2019t make the owner of the property liable for them if they\u2019re not a part of the business.\n\nWithout knowing anything on business formation or it\u2019s meaning you then jumped to \u2018fraud\u2019, reported them to the state as a \u2018false address\u2019 which isn\u2019t a thing, and went out of your way to tell so many people this person is dishonest. Hopefully they don\u2019t sue you.\n\nThe only \u2018evidence\u2019 you have is of the massive and needless drama your creating and how you\u2019ve committed libel and slander to their reputation. \n\nNeither you, your roommates, or landlord are responsible for anything that happens with this LLC and acts committed by it. Your protected by the fact that you are not a member of the LLC. Destiny used your address as the place where she can receive official correspondence from the state/irs/others regarding the business. The same as your mailing address. \n\nShould she have done it? Not at all. Is it business fraud? Not at all. Could it violate your lease and get you or your roommates in trouble? Depends on lease language, if the lease specifically prohibits the registration of businesses/conducting business at the address then yes. Do you have other issues for allowing a non-listed tenant to reside at your residence? Probably yes. \n\nYou can change an LLC\u2019s address online anytime at the secretary of state\u2019s website, as many times as you want to any address you want. Even if someone registered the wrong address, and you wanted to sue them, you\u2019d just serve the Secretary of State, they\u2019d send a letter to the last known address, and service is complete (we handle this all the time). The state doesn\u2019t care if the address is wrong. The entity is responsible for informing the state of their address for notice purposes and if they miss a notice, that\u2019s on them.", "Christ in a cracker you\u2019re over the top. Where is the fraud exactly? That she used her boyfriends address as her business location? Is she actually defrauding people? Running a scam? This is an issue between destiny and her bf.

Mind your own business.", "YTA\n\nYou haven't even given her a chance to explain or correct it. You way jumped the gun.

Poor Destiny and all your roommates sounds like they have to put up with a lot from you.", "ESH. My guy you are acting like shes running a meth lab out of your apartment. She should have asked. You found out. The right thing to do would be to ask her to change it. When she gets back give her a week or something to follow through.

If the building isn\u2019t zoned correctly then the business will likely be shut down.\n\nIt\u2019s more importantly wrong because most leases state you cannot have it operate or listed as a business address and it can be cause for eviction.

A warning to take the address off the business; maybe a word to the landlord.\n\nI think reporting it as fraud works as a good fallback/threat to get the person to stop.", "Because it is business fraud? She signed up with a fraudulent address. You need to use an address that you have permission to use.

If she was being shady, wouldn't that have occurred to her?", "But lots of places allow small businesses to operate out of residential zoning if that business isn't going to increase parking. Depending on the business, it may even be allowed in the lease. I mean, think of all the piano teachers or small time bookkeepers. They dont need a brick and mortar store front. I'm also not a lawyer (but I have been involved in land use), but this doesn't necessarily strike me as a cut and dry case of 'business fraud'. This person seems over the top in their anxiety about this. I don't think Destiny should have listed her business there and definitely not without permission, but I doubt this is a situation where the landlord will sweep in with a speedy eviction. The OP could have waited a moment to hash this out.", "Agricultural is the other zoning category", "Yes, I live in the EU and if we ever receive mail that doesn't have mine or my fianc\u00e9's name on it, I take pic and send it to the landlord. He deals with it from that point on, but how is he supposed to know the mail arrived if I don't notify him? NTA mostly because we all know how hard is to find decent apartment and no one wants to lose it over some stupid thing someone else did.", "Piano teachers don\u2019t file an LLC. If she has that she is not doing some small business that no one will really notice(if it\u2019s a profitable business anyway). But OP knows their lease and I\u2019m sure they would know that theirs allows. But every apartment I have ever lived in explicitly states you cannot use the address for a business of any sort. And destiny using the fake address actually is 100% fraud", "that's curious. i also live in the EU, but here if you receive mail to your address with the wrong name, the general advice is that you write \"wrong address\" on it, send it back to the post and let them deal with it", "they literally said  the landlord needs to be informed", "I think the eviction part is the biggest problem. Most leases do not allow for operating a business in the dwelling so that would definitely make this not an overreaction.", "Most leases state you cannot run a business from your rental and it is cause for eviction", "It depends on the type of the mail. The sender chooses the type. If you choose 'basic' mail, the postman will simply leave it on the adress and you can't really return it. This is the cheapest option and although not the safest most people and most companies and also the goverment still choses this. There is also a different option where you pay more BUT the postman will return the mail if the person doesn't actually live there.", "I think it depend on context. I received a lot of wrong mail (people that moved out before I started renting there) and it's obviously just some company didn't updated their database. but if got a mail with a wrong name of someone I know, addressed to a business set up at my address, I will take notice", "You can't throw it in the mailbox with return to sender/wrong address on it?", "This difference does not exist in the EU country I live in", "Not if it is a business address. You return it but the problem still there. Your address is still recorded as the business headquarters and you need to correct that ASAP.", "I hear you, but wouldn't the pount be alleeting the sender that the address is wrong? Might be easier and more reasonable than jumping to reporting fraud. She did correct the address when op confronted her.", "It is not as simple as that. Again, different country but a friend of mine moved to a house a few years back that the previous tenant used as his company's headquarters. The guy apparently owed the tax man a lot of money so one day he gets home and he has a warning plastered over his door saying that the tax authorities are coming over to basi ally repossess everything they find inside in order to cover the debt because the address was still registered to the company. They had sent mail back, done everything like that and the only thing that worked was to spend their time calling the tax authority and saying they have nothing to do with it and that the person no longer lives there and they are the new tenants. To be fair, the process was speedy. They just sent a rental agreement shows their move in date and their tax number but it was quite stressful. They risked having the police knock on their door.", "Where I live by sending 'basic' mail you are not required to write the sender's adress on the envelope. However, if it's mail from the goverment or a company it's usually writen somewhere. Techically, you can go to the post office and ask them to send it back but they don't have to if they don't want to. The only thing you can probably do is to send the mail back with a letter that notifies them that the adress is wrong."]}
