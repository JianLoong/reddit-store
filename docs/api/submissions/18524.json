It does not mean the business transacts any business at that address or that a store is located there. A single address can have hundreds of businesses registered to it, that doesn\u2019t make the owner of the property liable for them if they\u2019re not a part of the business.\n\nWithout knowing anything on business formation or it\u2019s meaning you then jumped to \u2018fraud\u2019, reported them to the state as a \u2018false address\u2019 which isn\u2019t a thing, and went out of your way to tell so many people this person is dishonest.

Depends on lease language, if the lease specifically prohibits the registration of businesses/conducting business at the address then yes. Do you have other issues for allowing a non-listed tenant to reside at your residence? Probably yes. \n\nYou can change an LLC\u2019s address online anytime at the secretary of state\u2019s website, as many times as you want to any address you want. Even if someone registered the wrong address, and you wanted to sue them, you\u2019d just serve the Secretary of State, they\u2019d send a letter to the last known address, and service is complete (we handle this all the time).

I'm also not a lawyer (but I have been involved in land use), but this doesn't necessarily strike me as a cut and dry case of 'business fraud'.

They had sent mail back, done everything like that and the only thing that worked was to spend their time calling the tax authority and saying they have nothing to do with it and that the person no longer lives there and they are the new tenants.

They risked having the police knock on their door.", "Where I live by sending 'basic' mail you are not required to write the sender's adress on the envelope.

See: Myself, an attorney, and the very confused CPA further down the thread, who do not understand why on earth everyone is freaking out about this.\n\n\\*Disclaimer as to the legal part, I am licensed in *one* jurisdiction.\\*\n\nOP has three roommates. One of the roommates has a girlfriend, Destiny, who is 22. OP's apartment received some mail addressed to \"Destiny's LLC,\" OP googled it, and found out that Destiny has started an **online** little business/shop thing. According to the Secretary of State's website, Destiny used OP and her roommate's address as her business address. Destiny did not ask permission to do this.\n\nA \"registered corporate address\" is the address where a business receives mail. It is not the address where the business operates, a) because the Secretary of State doesn't care about that, all it cares about is where it can send you official mail and notifications to comply with any statutory notice requirements, and b) a business may have hundreds of physical addresses, or zero physical addresses (like in this case where the business is online, the case of a piano teacher or language tutor who makes house calls rather than having a physical studio, etc). All these folks talking about zoning issues don't seem to understand that zoning is up to the local government to determine and enforce, not the Secretary of State, and that unless something wildly unusual is going on, you're not going to violate a zoning ordinance by having mail for an *online* shop sent to your address. Zoning is to control what is *physically* going on in an area. But I digress.\n\nOP (nor many of these commenters) does not seem to understand that the registered address of a business is the address where the business receives mail, not the address where the business operates, presumably because everyone here (OP, Destiny, and the other roommates) is fairly young and has no experience with this.\n\nOP is also freaking out because for some reason she thinks this will get them evicted by her landlord (maybe she thinks the landlord will think Destiny is living there without being on the lease? Or that the landlord will think they're running a business out of the rental property?), and being blacklisted by their landlord would be bad because landlord owns most of the local rental properties.\n\nOP looks at the addresses for the business (addresses, plural, so clearly there is some info here that OP is leaving out), and sees that the zip code on one of them is a number off, and believes that the zip code for the other is fake because she doesn't recognize it as being a zip code for her city. OP decides for some reason that Destiny is committing business fraud rather than committing a typo.\n\nOP asked Destiny about the LLC \\[Destiny and her boyfriend (OP's roommate) are on vacation, so OP has not actually talked to them about this in person, only text. They only got the mail a couple days ago\\], who said she used their address because she was in the middle of moving and didn't want her mail to get lost. She says she changed the address. Nothing is registered to OP's apartment anymore. OP did not ask Destiny about the other stuff, like the address zip codes.\n\nOP has now nevertheless reported Destiny to the Secretary of State for *business fraud*, because she thinks it \"raised red flags\" and was \"shady,\" despite not actually asking her about most of it first (per her response to the bot of \"why I think I might be the AH,\" OP says she did \"not \\[give\\] her a chance to respond before reporting her\"), nor talking to a lawyer or any other professional to see if it actually was; contacted the landlord and laid out the whole situation (who, by the way, absolutely would have been none the wiser otherwise); doesn't seem to understand that her actions are what is going to bring the landlord's attention to their apartment; and overall doesn't seem to understand the implications of any of this.\n\nOh, and OP says no one involved has any money for a lawyer, which is why it was so important for her to take these steps to \"protect\" herself and her roommates, but also that means Destiny clearly has no money for one either and may get absolutely screwed even if it was a simple mistake, or even if it turns out to not have been illegal at all.\n\nDoes that help?", "Bingo. I'm an attorney, and I think a lot of the folks responding just don't understand the situation. She didn't claim she was running a business out of their apartment - she just used it as the mailing address for a little LLC or something.
