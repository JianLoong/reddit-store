It does not mean the business transacts any business at that address or that a store is located there. A single address can have hundreds of businesses registered to it, that doesn\u2019t make the owner of the property liable for them if they\u2019re not a part of the business.\n\nWithout knowing anything on business formation or it\u2019s meaning you then jumped to \u2018fraud\u2019, reported them to the state as a \u2018false address\u2019 which isn\u2019t a thing, and went out of your way to tell so many people this person is dishonest.

Depends on lease language, if the lease specifically prohibits the registration of businesses/conducting business at the address then yes. Do you have other issues for allowing a non-listed tenant to reside at your residence? Probably yes. \n\nYou can change an LLC\u2019s address online anytime at the secretary of state\u2019s website, as many times as you want to any address you want. Even if someone registered the wrong address, and you wanted to sue them, you\u2019d just serve the Secretary of State, they\u2019d send a letter to the last known address, and service is complete (we handle this all the time).

They had sent mail back, done everything like that and the only thing that worked was to spend their time calling the tax authority and saying they have nothing to do with it and that the person no longer lives there and they are the new tenants.

They risked having the police knock on their door.", "Where I live by sending 'basic' mail you are not required to write the sender's adress on the envelope.

See: Myself, an attorney, and the very confused CPA further down the thread, who do not understand why on earth everyone is freaking out about this.\n\n\\*Disclaimer as to the legal part, I am licensed in *one* jurisdiction.\\*\n\nOP has three roommates. One of the roommates has a girlfriend, Destiny, who is 22. OP's apartment received some mail addressed to \"Destiny's LLC,\" OP googled it, and found out that Destiny has started an **online** little business/shop thing. According to the Secretary of State's website, Destiny used OP and her roommate's address as her business address. Destiny did not ask permission to do this.\n\nA \"registered corporate address\" is the address where a business receives mail. It is not the address where the business operates, a) because the Secretary of State doesn't care about that, all it cares about is where it can send you official mail and notifications to comply with any statutory notice requirements, and b) a business may have hundreds of physical addresses, or zero physical addresses (like in this case where the business is online, the case of a piano teacher or language tutor who makes house calls rather than having a physical studio, etc). All these folks talking about zoning issues don't seem to understand that zoning is up to the local government to determine and enforce, not the Secretary of State, and that unless something wildly unusual is going on, you're not going to violate a zoning ordinance by having mail for an *online* shop sent to your address. Zoning is to control what is *physically* going on in an area. But I digress.\n\nOP (nor many of these commenters) does not seem to understand that the registered address of a business is the address where the business receives mail, not the address where the business operates, presumably because everyone here (OP, Destiny, and the other roommates) is fairly young and has no experience with this.\n\nOP is also freaking out because for some reason she thinks this will get them evicted by her landlord (maybe she thinks the landlord will think Destiny is living there without being on the lease? Or that the landlord will think they're running a business out of the rental property?), and being blacklisted by their landlord would be bad because landlord owns most of the local rental properties.\n\nOP looks at the addresses for the business (addresses, plural, so clearly there is some info here that OP is leaving out), and sees that the zip code on one of them is a number off, and believes that the zip code for the other is fake because she doesn't recognize it as being a zip code for her city. OP decides for some reason that Destiny is committing business fraud rather than committing a typo.\n\nOP asked Destiny about the LLC \\[Destiny and her boyfriend (OP's roommate) are on vacation, so OP has not actually talked to them about this in person, only text. They only got the mail a couple days ago\\], who said she used their address because she was in the middle of moving and didn't want her mail to get lost. She says she changed the address. Nothing is registered to OP's apartment anymore. OP did not ask Destiny about the other stuff, like the address zip codes.\n\nOP has now nevertheless reported Destiny to the Secretary of State for *business fraud*, because she thinks it \"raised red flags\" and was \"shady,\" despite not actually asking her about most of it first (per her response to the bot of \"why I think I might be the AH,\" OP says she did \"not \\[give\\] her a chance to respond before reporting her\"), nor talking to a lawyer or any other professional to see if it actually was; contacted the landlord and laid out the whole situation (who, by the way, absolutely would have been none the wiser otherwise); doesn't seem to understand that her actions are what is going to bring the landlord's attention to their apartment; and overall doesn't seem to understand the implications of any of this.\n\nOh, and OP says no one involved has any money for a lawyer, which is why it was so important for her to take these steps to \"protect\" herself and her roommates, but also that means Destiny clearly has no money for one either and may get absolutely screwed even if it was a simple mistake, or even if it turns out to not have been illegal at all.\n\nDoes that help?", "Bingo. I'm an attorney, and I think a lot of the folks responding just don't understand the situation. She didn't claim she was running a business out of their apartment - she just used it as the mailing address for a little LLC or something.

Extremely childish and ignorant behavior.", "NOT an attorney, and I also was very surprised by OP going almost nuclear, about something her roommate's gf maybe actually didn't understand, and without giving her an actual timeframe to correct her mistake.", "\u261d\ud83c\udffbThese were the comments I was looking for! People with actual expertise to weigh in and validate my gut reaction. (Assuming you really are a member of the profession you claim to be.)\n\nYTA OP. Instead of staying calm and asking experts for advice, you went right off the deep end. Next time, slow your roll and try not to be such a catastrophist.", "Do we know she didn\u2019t ask her boyfriend, who is on the lease? I would assume she did.", "Or maybe she asked her boyfriend, who is on the lease, if it was ok to have her mail sent there in the meantime. And he didn\u2019t think to mention it, because it does not affect any of the roommates at all.", "And that address means is \u201cwhere you can send me mail\u201d\n\nMany businesses have many or zero physical locations.", "Running a physical business out of your apartment might but putting down an address to receive mail at absolutely doesn\u2019t.", "They actually do have LLCs. A lot of self-employed people do. It\u2019s a way to file your income without working for an outside company and the address you list is just a reliable mailing address to get your business mail sent to, ESPECIALLY for an online business without a physical address.", "It depends on what paperwork we're talking about. I'm actually in the process of purchasing a local small business, and I recently set up an LLC. In my case, I'm using my home address with the intention of changing it to the address of the physical storefront once the acquisition is finalized, and no one I've worked with in the process thinks this is an odd thing to do. The broker, the lawyer, the accountant, my business partner, my husband who owns a different small business.... All of them seem to think this is perfectly reasonable and normal.\n\nIn the form through the state for the initial LLC creation, it was just one single place on the application where I had to fill in the address. Same for the federal EIN. Same for my license to do business in my state. Each one is its own separate page, and each only asks the address once. The mail coming from state and from federal look pretty similar, so it could be that she typo'd each in a different way? It wouldn't be *completely* outlandish -- especially if she's in the process of moving. If, say, she lives in 60123 but her boyfriend lives in 60124, that'd explain the one, and if she's moving to 60696, which isn't similar to either, it's.... *possible*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of that being said, it does seem weird that she used *her boyfriend's* address. Even if she's moving, she's still going back and forth between her old place and her new place, so why not just use her new address? Or use the old address and then set up forwarding with the post office? Why use a third address and not even run it by her boyfriend? That part seems really weird.\n\nI'm not sold that it's fraud, it could just be that she's a total flake, but.... Either way *something* is hinky.", "She doesn't need to work or live at an address to be able tor receive business mail at that address. OP is blowing this way out of proportion, there is no legal danger to him, and she's not committing any kind of fraud. YTA, OP.", "You are looking for fraud or similar fault.", "Let me give you an example of how wrong this statement is. I do my taxes. I file my taxes. Five years later the IRS sends me a bill that shows I miscalculated. Pure and simple miscalculation. I owed $500 more than I thought, and than I had paid. The IRS is now charging me $1,500 -- the initial $500 I owed, plus penalties, plus the interest accrued on all this over the last five years. You know what the IRS is NOT doing? Charing me with tax avoidance. Because there was no intent to defraud the IRS. I just made a mistake.", "Still not fraud. She just mail sent there that wasn\u2019t wanted. That\u2019s it.", "It is most likely that she asked her boyfriend, who is on the lease.  \n\nAs multiple other people have said, the registered address with the state is just where they mail correspondence so that they are able to contact you if needed. \n\nFor physical businesses, the business permit with the municipality needs to be the actual physical address, but that doesn\u2019t apply to online businesses. There is absolutely nothing illegal with what she\u2019s done, and it would have zero impact on their tenancy.", "At first thought you wrote \"that tool\" OP.", "Yes, when you call law enforcement, nothing bad ever, ever happens as long as the person wasn't committing a crime.", "HAHA OP is a tool tbh.", "Thanks I'm stealing that one now", "You had permission to send you mail to your sister's house. (I assume, that would be pretty weird otherwise lol) Authorization from the owner is a sufficient connection. That's more connection than the roommate's gf who OP is dealing with.", "Okay but she also changed it as soon as OP asked and it\u2019s not like it was a stranger, I\u2019m sure Destiny told Devin, just not all the roommates. Should she have asked OP, of course! But it\u2019s hardly the same as sending business mail to a total stranger. I had my W-2s sent to my boyfriend\u2019s house bc they have more secure deliveries and I didn\u2019t ask both his roommates first just told my bf, it\u2019s hardly tax fraud it\u2019s just mail."]}
