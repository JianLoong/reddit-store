I also knew my wife would struggle when she finally did pass so I tried to convince her to go to therapy but she\u2019s refused.\n\nWe have two older children (13 and 6) and this year, she gave birth to our youngest. This is the only grandchild my MIL never got to meet. The whole pregnancy was very bittersweet and my wife kept saying \u201cI wish mom was here, I wish mom could meet him, etc\u201d. Again, to be expected.\n\nBut the issue has come up that even before our son was born, every event went back to her mom. At first I understood but in time, it\u2019s become like we have this cloud hanging over us, preventing us from fully enjoying happy moments. I\u2019ve tried talking to my wife about it, gently but she gets super defensive and refuses to even talk about therapy.\n\nOur eldest turned 13 over the weekend. She had spoken to her mom privately and said she\u2019d really like for their to be no talk of her grandmother. She wanted to have a happy celebration and not get sad that her grandmother isn\u2019t there. My wife agreed.\n\nWe went out to dinner and everything was fine. Towards the end, we had cake. My wife said \u201cit\u2019s just so sad that grandma can\u2019t be here! She\u2019d be so proud of who (eldest) has turned out to be! I wish she could be here!\u201d\n\nOur eldest got mad. She blew out her candles but didn\u2019t speak the rest of the dinner. When we got home, I spoke to my wife privately and said what she did wasn\u2019t fair. I said she could\u2019ve excused herself if she was that emotional, but she honestly didn\u2019t seem to be. I told her that this can\u2019t continue to happen. She told me that wasn\u2019t fair. I said what isn\u2019t fair is this rain cloud she forces over us. \n\nShe\u2019s been off ever since and won\u2019t really talk to me or our eldest. She says we\u2019re insensitive.

Your WIFE is being insensitive, not you or your child.\n\nI get it - my da died just before I got pregnant and it\u2019s so hard that my daughter won\u2019t know him and love him as I did. But children\u2019s birthdays aren\u2019t about dead people.\n\nMy family, at Christmas, Easter, and on the dinners we have on the deceased\u2019s birthdays give a toast \u201cto our boys\u201d (my da, brothers, and nephew have all passed away).

We wouldn\u2019t toast our dead at a 13 yo\u2019s birthday unless like\u2026the person died the week before. Even then, it would be about what the kid wants. Some people find solace in remembrance. Others find only pain. Your daughter was 11 when she lost her grandma in a big illness - it\u2019s probably one of her more traumatic memories.

It sucks she lost her mum, but it's never going to not hurt. \n\nShe needs to realise that everyone knows its sad she isn't there, and they miss her too, but constantly bringing it up will create an element of resentment in the kids that she doesn't want to create. \n\nMy mum started buying me a little present on my birthday and at christmas from my grandparent's when they died as a way to remember them.

She needs therapy. She obviously needs help to move on more than she has. Grief is aweful and people react differently. But to do this every single event?? You all can never be happy with this noose around your necks. Everytime you think it's off, your wife just puts it back on. It will make your kids hate your wife.

So nta at all about boundaries because the kids are saying this hurts them and she ignores it. That's completely fair and they're allowed to draw lines in the sand. \n\nBut 2 years isn't that long and death like that is hard. You cannot dictate how someone processes it. My mom died this year and I don't think I'll ever get over it, even with therapy. I will be sad when our child is born and every time something happens I wish she could have been there for. My therapist has made it very clear I will hurt more and most likely regress for the first couple of \"new\" milestones without her. \n\nYour wife should be able to come to you, and her family, with how she genuinely feels. There is no timeline for grief and it shouldn't be rushed because it's uncomfortable for you. She should be allowed to say she misses her, talk about her, and that she wishes she could be there at appropriate times imo.", "NTA\n\nGrief can run so deep, and often times people never fully get over it. But we can learn to coexist with it so that it doesn't consume us. It's truly so sad that your wife is so lost within her grief, and I really hope you all can get through to her.\n\nIt's been two years and your wife's inability to process her grief is affecting all of you for the worse.

Constantly mentioning stuff like this brings everyone the mood down for everyone. Not only that, but the eldest spoke to her about it and asked her not to talk about grandmother. It almost sounds as if she hasn't properly grieved, but even so there's no reason for her to be bringing it up as often as she is. Therapy sounds like a reasonable ask and she really should consider it.", "NTA,\n\nSadly she's not processing this wake up call for what it is. She needs a therapist and fast before she tanks every relationship she has in her grief.", "NTA, it sounds like you\u2019re being as understanding as you can be.

Your daughter asked one thing if her, but her grief is still so deep she couldn't stop herself from breaking that agreement. We all handle grief different but your daughter has reached an age where there are major changes ahead, what will happen the day she needs her mom? Your wife's grief is standing in the way of the relationship she can have with your daughter, their relationship could be as strong as the one she has with grandmother, but instead she is pushing everyone away.\n\nI'm also thinking that your wife's might feel nobody really cared about grandmother because you avoid taking about it, which could make her hold on tighter to the memories.\n\nGood luck with your family", "NTA everybody grieves differently, and thats fair, but when its affecting your kids, its fair of you to require her to get therapy.", "NTA. My brother died like 13 years ago and while I love and miss him immensely, I don\u2019t make everyone else suffer too. My mother on the other hand is the complete opposite, and EVERY holiday or event has to be about mourning that he isn\u2019t there. She will spend entire Thanksgivings for example being weepy and inconsolable, but also expects that she gets every holiday to herself because he isn\u2019t there. Fuck me, right? I guess me being there doesn\u2019t matter, since he\u2019s not, the only thing that\u2019s allowed is to make every holiday and special moment about the fact that he isn\u2019t there. She\u2019s also a malignant narc too so that makes it worse but regardless, this type of behavior is exhausting. Like, I am well aware that he isn\u2019t here, I hate it and it hurts and I think of him all the time, but everything doesn\u2019t have to become another memorial service for him foisted on everyone else.", "NTA. While grief is different for everyone, if 2 years after the death, she is still struggling to the extent that EVERY event relates back to her mother\u2019s passing, it\u2019s time to seek therapy. Better to address it sooner before it impacts her relationships with her children and her spouse even more than it already has.", "Grief is hard to process, but it seems your spouse isn't exactly processing... it also seems you were supportive for a long time. I don't think it's unreasonable/insensitive to expect your wife keep some of her thoughts to herself, especially if it's starting to have negative impact on your children. She disappointed her daughter when she broke her promise. NTA. Your wife really really needs a grief counsellor asap.", "NTA", "NAH. Describing grief like a cloud hanging over you is exactly right. My brother died in 2018 and my kids were born in 2019 and 2021. For a while it felt like I\u2019d never know true happiness again. Because every bit of happiness comes with a twinge of pain. Seeing my kids on Christmas morning is a joy, but also a reminder that my brother never got a chance to be their uncle, and he should be with us too. Maybe dinner wasn\u2019t the greatest place to bring it up, but 2 years is still pretty early in the grief process (some people say year 2 is even harder than year 1). She can\u2019t stop feeling sad at milestones just because it makes you uncomfortable. People who are grieving don\u2019t want their loved ones erased, and speaking their name can bring comfort. My mom does the same.\n\nYou may need to set boundaries about when to have those conversations moving forward. I can understand your daughter being upset (my mom bringing up my brother is sometimes nice and sometimes a bit much). But I don\u2019t think your wife is totally in the wrong here. She was trying to say grandma would be proud too, she just worded it poorly. I also don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong for voicing concern for your daughter either\n\nI think this is just a hard situation. One I can relate to.

But it really sounds likke", "This actually hits close to home for me. My grandma passed way almost three years ago. After she passed my mother was understandably devastated, my grandma was her rock. \n\nMy mother handled her grief by talking about her mom a lot and will still mention her. Kind of like how your wife does. If there\u2019s a big life event she\u2019ll tear up and say \u201cgrandma would be so happy right now\u201d. \n\nThe issue was my aunt, my moms sister. Her way of handling my grandma passing away was not to talk about her. At family dinners she wouldn\u2019t bring up my grandma. When my mom would mention her, she would try and steer the conversation away from it. \n\nThis caused some conflict because my mom wanted to talk about and celebrate her mom while my aunt wanted to silently grieve. \n\nMy mom had a hard time understanding why my aunt didn\u2019t want to talk about their mom. To her it didn\u2019t make sense.\n\nThankfully they were able to meet and talk things out. They were both able to recognize that they deeply loved their mom, but had different ways of dealing with their grief. \n\nThere isn\u2019t a right way to grieve, and therapy can help. It did for my mom. But I have a feeling your wife bring up her mom for the same reasons my mom does. She misses them everyday and doesn\u2019t want them to be forgotten. \n\nI think the best thing you can do is directly talk about the grief. Discuss how the way she handles the loss of her mom may be different from how your children handle the loss of their grandma. \n\nThe best solution to this is a lot of love.

I feel for your daughter. It was a simple ask and she didnt get respected.", "NTA You've seemed like the perfectly rational person in this whole situation, I understand grief doesn't have a timeline, but when it starts affecting your family you need to get help/therapy. If she's against therapy would she join a grief share group of some kind?", "I'm going against the grain here. NAH. For many, even with therapy, that kind of grief/loss often never goes away. You learn to live with it, but there's nothing wrong with the feeling that you wish that person was still there to share those things with - especially if you'd had hopes/dreams in the past of them being there to witness those things. It's normal.   \n\n\nIt's not wrong of her to feel that way, and to forbid her to say it out loud is cruel.
