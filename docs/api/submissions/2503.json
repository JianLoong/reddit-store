Her way of handling my grandma passing away was not to talk about her. At family dinners she wouldn\u2019t bring up my grandma.

You learn to live with it, but there's nothing wrong with the feeling that you wish that person was still there to share those things with - especially if you'd had hopes/dreams in the past of them being there to witness those things.

That NO ONE is invalidating her grief, but rather that you want her to have better tools to help her COPE with it, because she clearly isn't, and it's not right that her inability to cope with that grief is causing your children serious anxiety. I think that another commenter was right that if she still refuses to get help at that point, that you make it clear that you and the kids will be seeing a therapist without her, because she is breaking your family with her behaviour, and if she won't get help, you and the children need coping strategies of your own to deal with this.  \n\nYou are NTA. I'm sorry that it has reached this point.", "It's possible that your wife is suffering from postpartum depression.  \nI don't know if that's the case but all the pre and post pregnancy hormones combined with the grief could be exacerbating the problem.", "NTA - she needs help.

She's the one who refused to go to therapy.", "NTA.", "I haven't lost my parents but we all will eventually lose our parents. They can't live forever. My grandma had alzheimer's disease and I was her caregiver.  It was hard losing her. It's amazing how attached you can become to someone who didn't even know who you are. She called me auntie, sister, mama and grandma. I think about her constantly. My first child was born 3 months before she passed and my two other children never got to meet her. You can't wallow in what you've lost cause when your to strapped up in your own grief and pain, you can't see the pain you are causing other people. You turn their special moments into sad memories. Your wife needs help.", "My grandmother passed away just a couple of months after my daughter was born. Grandma that I was named after, closer to than I would say my own mother, that I then named my daughter after. She never got to meet my daughter and it makes me sad. I think about it on holidays and birthdays, makes me tear up. But nobody else realizes it. Because those days are about the family that's left.", "NTA. \nMy father died 2 months before my son was born, and he passed in a way that was very traumatic for my husband and I. I'd be lying if I said it didn't make a lot important moments bittersweet for us. It's totally normal to think of our loved ones at big moments and family celebrations, but it's not normal or healthy to let that ruin things for everyone every time. I doubt that's what her mom would have wanted for her family when she passed away. \nI would definitely suggest trying to talk to her again about grief counseling, or maybe a support group for people who have been through similar things.", "NTA.  Your wife is certainly stuck in her grieving process.  Her grief is affecting the whole family, your baby may never know a childhood \"happy\" birthday if your wife doesn't move through her grief.  It may be time to insist on couples counseling as a way to get her some grief counseling.  Don't mention her grief as a problem, just tell her you Leo her but there are a few things troubling you.  Maybe you can say its about being a little overwhelmed by the new baby. The key may be to approach this as a marriage tune up/couples counseling thing, an \"us\" problem not a \"her\" problem.   Then let your wife and the counselor \"discover\" the effect her grief is having on her and your family.  Best of luck to you all.   I can see you love your wife and kids, and just want to have a happy family again.", "NTA, leaning towards NAH because like... I don't know how much I can fault your wife when she's like... clearly not okay?\n\nIf it's just her redirecting attention to herself, that's one thing. But if we choose to interpret her actions in a way that isn't really cynical, she needs to get some help to deal with the trauma of losing her mother. Trauma comes in lots of different forms, and losing a loved one to cancer *is* traumatic. If she hasn't processed or handled that grief, she needs to. It's isolating her from her family.", "NTA: but your wife isn\u2019t either, I think she messed up out of trauma reaction. She absolutely needs grief counselling and she owes your daughter a conversation and apology, but this seems a little dismissive of the grief she\u2019s experiencing. \n\nThe thing is you shouldn\u2019t have said what you said. When you lose someone, every milestone feels bittersweet, sometimes just bitter. I lost my big sister last year, and every good thing that happens is accompanied by enormous amounts grief (and I\u2019m in counselling). To have a milestone occur without the presence of your favourite people being around to join is one of the worst things one can experience. She loved her mom so much, and loves her daughter, she clearly is thinking about how much love would have been shared and was just sad that it couldn\u2019t happen. The comment didn\u2019t seem overly emotional, she was just expressing that her mom would have been proud. From her perspective she probably felt she was giving a compliment to you daughter. That shouldn\u2019t have warranted that bad of a reaction imo, she didn\u2019t cry and ruin the happiness. The idea she can\u2019t ever mention her mom in a positive light is unfair to her.\n\nShe might feel alone in her grief. I do agree she needs counselling, but as her husband you need to let her feel what she\u2019s feeling. Maybe ask if she wants to spend time looking through photos and talking about some favourite memories you all had with her mom, that can help kickstart the grieving process if she\u2019s been putting it off.\n\nIf she is emotional, she needs to learn when to excuse herself if she\u2019s in the company of people who aren\u2019t capable of supporting her through those moments, just sucks her family can\u2019t be those people for her.\n\nI think it would be worth talking to your daughter about how she might feel in her moms position so she can be a little bit more understanding of what your wife is going through, and then your wife can also apologize for failing to take the right steps to ensure her mental state is good for her family. Both are valid positions, but I really would like to stress that grief does a lot to your brain, and no one seems to be taking that into consideration, seems like you all want her to shut up and she\u2019s just missing her mom. Overall sad situation.", "NAH\n\nSo they say anxiety has to do with worrying about the future and depression has to do with looking and being stuck in the past.

Your wife had her mom when humans need parents. Their relationship was probably so good because her entire childhood wasn't a real time in memoriam show.

But I don\u2019t know if this would work and a therapist might have better ideas on how to approach this.  I think you already know she is clinging to the grief.  Her actions could be because she is stuck in the grief.  But it could be more complex and rooted in a desire for attention.  So I don\u2019t think pressure on her ie threats of divorce if you don\u2019t go to therapy would be very helpful.  She seems to lack self awareness.

Also, I have ADHD... so I\u2019m not speaking from an uninformed perspective. Anyway, peace", "Let's see who's the one with the \"stupidly ignorant\" train of thought.\n\nYou're suggesting that \n\na) CHILDREN should go to therapy and figure out how to deal with their mother's unreasonable behaviour that's negatively affecting them emotionally\n\nb) these children and their dad should put up with this negative environment caused by their grieving mom who \\*refuses\\* help and has been rejecting requests to go to therapy for \\*two years\\*\n\nc) they should continue putting up with this for the rest of their life\n\nbecause......... family?", "NAH, even a light YTA. I said this above, but I think asking someone not to mention their loved one for x day is just\u2026an odd request to support. Mom didn\u2019t overwhelm the day, she just mentioned the gma bc she\u2019s thinking about her, maybe wants to include her memory in the day, and she should be allowed to do that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a sign of disordered grieving at all. It actually seems more like she wants her moms memory to be a part of the positivity of the day, which is a lovely thing. \n\nA birthday is a birthday, the loss of a parent is deep, and meaningful. There\u2019s no reason these things have to conflict or be at cross purposes or be contradictory somehow. They\u2019re both a part of life and exist together, and maybe OP\u2019s wife understands that better than OP or OP\u2019s daughter does. \n\nIt seems possible that OP\u2019s wife is resisting the therapy idea bc she\u2019s reading it as a request to sort of deal w and resolve her grief, etc. somewhere else. Maybe she doesn\u2019t want to \u201cresolve\u201d the grief, maybe she wants to carry her mother\u2019s memory w her. It\u2019s actually a beautiful way of expressing her love, and it shouldn\u2019t be seen or fretted about as if it\u2019s an inconvenience.", "NTA. Your wife however is. She needs to go to therapy and stop emotionally dumping on you all. My sister got married soon after our dad died and had her first child a year after. While she missed our dad and was sad he never met her husband of kids she never continuously brought up the fact that he\u2019d never see this or that.", "NTA you did it to stand up for your child not to belittle your wife's loss.", "She definitely needs grief counseling.\n\nIf she's resistant, here's what you can consider. Before a big event, you sit with her, have her write a letter to her mom, express how much she wishes she were here, and then burn the letter, put it through a shredder, etc. this is a letter never to be seen, it's just for her to express her feelings, maybe you can read it so someone sees her feelings if she wants and you're okay with that, and that's it, that's her moment to share the event/occasion with her mother. Not the actual day of, not in the middle of people being happy.", "Your wife\u2019s the AH. Send her the link to this post, let her see the responses herself. She may be upset but it\u2019s anonymous so no one truly knows who it\u2019s about.", "NTA, your wife doesn't get a pass for ruining every event. She either needs to get therapy or move on. Regardless your children and you shouldn't be forced to make every single positive event into another \"woe is me\" about her mom. That's selfish and really unfair!", "NAH. Your daughter specifically asked her not to bring up her mother, and she agreed. But she did it anyway. She can feel however she wants to. But how she acts is a choice. I understand that the grief is always there, but she needs another avenue to vent to, because her family can't do that for her anymore. Is her father still around? Any other family she can talk to?", "Your wife needs to speak to professionals about her grief. She is holding onto too tightly and it\u2019s affecting the kids negatively.", "It's obviously becoming a huge issue if her own child specifically requested no grandma talk. You definitely need to put your foot down on this. \n\nI know she's refused it but I can't see this stopping unless she gets counsel. I wonder if sitting you three down and letting your eldest speak might help here?\n\nTricky situation but you 100% did the right thing.\n\nEdit: my own father died young so I get it, but I certainly wouldn't do this to other people- especially people's birthdays.", "NTA. She's giving your daughter the cold shoulder? Badly done, especially as she let your daughter down, not the other way around. She needs to understand that she's destroying her relationships and *has* to get help.", "NTA. She told her child she wouldn't bring up their deceased grandmother, then went back on that promise. I hope y'all are trying to be overall supportive to her as the grief process is different for everyone in duration and presentation, but it sounds like y'all are. And if it's at the point that it's harming the family, it's gone beyond just her needing individual therapy and into group/family/couple's counselling territory.", "NTA: It is very tragic that your wife lost her mother and she deserves some sympathy but after 2 years, the death of grandma shouldn't still prevent happy times regularly. Would your wife possibly be open to speaking to a counselor?", "Your wife is an asshole and if she keeps this up her children will be wishing she was dead too. Imagine ruining your own child's birthday because she couldn't stand not being the center of attention. Oh, look at me, I'm grieving.", "You just reminded me of what I like to call the worst birthday ever. My brother died about a week before my birthday and the funeral was the day before. My father, with only good intentions, bought me a card as though it was from my brother. I call it the most depressing birthday card. I got to open it, now knowing what I was about to see, while surrounded by my extended family who had come for the funeral. \n\nI can look back on it and laugh at the horror but holy shit, it was a depressing night.", "+1\n\nNTA", "I'm so sorry. My mother was the same way after my dad died; she would always bring up that he should be there, or how something would be better with him around. And yes, we were all missing him too, but she acted like being happy was disloyal to him or something and it really made the rest of the family pull away from her a little because of it. I hope your mother gets the help she needs.", "My god, that\u2019s awful!  My brother and I shared a birthday (but he was 10 years older).  He died by by suicide a month before my 8th birthday.  He left me a gift.  My parents just added it to the pile without warning me.", "Yikes. Sorry you experienced that.", "I was thinking that there might be an unfortunate cycle going on where daughter and other family members mention grandma less because they don't want to set wife off and wife mentions her more because she thinks everyone else is forgetting her.", "Welcome! Also good to know: \n\nESH = everyone sucks here\nYWBTA = you would be the asshole", "Not wanting her erased is a valid feeling. Plastering it over everything and everybody else like op's wife seems to do is a whole different thing.", ">Perhaps if it was phrased this way 'grief counselling' rather than therapy wife might see it differently. \n\n\nor even as \"someone to talk to about your mom, so you can share memories freely.\"\n\nI find one of the best parts about having a grief counsellor is I can just talk about my sister. I can tell her stories that my family & friends already know, reminisce and cry, and feel like I've made sure another person appreciates my sis, even if she's not here.", "I think part of the problem is that a lot of the language that people use to talk about the grieving process is really harsh. Like you often hear stuff about needing to \"move on,\" \"deal with,\" or \"get over\" someone's death.\n\nContributes to people thinking that stuff like grief therapy = forgetting your loved one forever.\n\nWhich is unfortunate because as you pointed out part of your grief therapy was finding healthy ways to remember your mom that actually fit with who she was as a person and her relationship to you.", "Completely agree w this. \n\nI also think the request to not bring up gma on the bday is a little much tbh\u2014it\u2019s a family celebration and mom clearly wants to feel like gma is included in some way. That\u2019s a really sweet impulse, and I don\u2019t think quieting talk of it is necessarily healthy. I get that its the daughters day, but giving a little space for one mention of your passed gma is okay\u2014maybe that brings up a spot of complicated feelings, but honestly that\u2019s a part of life, and a part of growing up. Which is what a bday is about anyway. It\u2019d be one thing if the mom was super abusive about it somehow. But i got the impression that the day went well, and she mentioned gma once. It\u2019s honestly sad that that has to derail the day. It seems cruel to tell someone \u201cdon\u2019t talk about your loved one today, it makes others uncomfortable\u201d, and I\u2019m not sure anyone has the right to ask.", "Because Mom is making everyone else's lives about her loss; it's as if no one is ever allowed to enjoy anything now. I don't mean they should act as though Mom/Grandma never existed, but the 13yo's joy in a birthday shouldn't be overshadowed by that loss either. Also OP's wife might be making the kids feel bad because they aren't grieving in the same way.", "The entire family just needs to learn to cope with mom's emotional abuse! Good call!", "That\u2019s a pretty reductive way of thinking about it. I agree there is some element of truth to it, but if the person in question is not willing to try therapy themselves, it can\u2019t hurt to go to therapy yourself in order to better cope with that person. If you want them in your life that is. If the OP and kids are prepared to give the wife/mother and ultimatum and leave then of course them utilising a therapist is moot.", "Only on Reddit would someone talking about their dead mother be classified as \"emotional abuse\".  Good grief.  It's like no one here knows how to interact with people in real life.", "The mom in this scenario is doing much more than just \"talking about\" her dead mother. She's been woebegone and bemoaning that her mom has passed during **every single milestone for the past 2 years** since she's died while refusing to any sort of therapy or counseling. It's to the point that **her own child** specifically asked her if she could not do so for **her own child's birthday** and she still did it.\n\nThis is well in excess of \"talking about\" the deceased. This is a fixation that she forces every single member of her family to deal with while refusing to deal with it herself.", "I'd say NTA but I don't think it's fair to put that judgement on someone still grieving. NAH, but your wife needs therapy", "Nta but she needs therapy but also her doctor because she also had a baby recently. Hormones are affecting her grief.\n\nIf she won\u2019t go maybe signed up the rest of the family for therapy and maybe you and older kid going will be the wake up call.", "This is effecting your kids emotionally and its hurting your family dynamic and she ruins litterly every happy moment. She's going to hurt and possibly stunt your kids emotionally in the long run and make them feel guilty for ever being happy. She needs to get therapy and she should have gone a long time ago back near the start of this. She will be making it so her kids need therapy if she doesn't get help and thats not ok. You need to stand firm and start pressing really hard for her to get help. Hell next time she brings up grandma you can tell her she can leave the room. Full on stop the celebration and tell her she needs to leave and stop ruining happy moments with her mothers death. Your kids don't need to feel guilty at every happy moment. Its not Healthy.\n\nHell maybe give her a reality check and show her these comments.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife is TA for two reasons: first of all, going back on an agreement she had with your child, which spoiled your child's birthday - that was really really thoughtless - and second of all, categorically refusing therapy.\n\nShe needs therapy, because her grieving process is starting to upset the kids. Your kid was rightly upset, and you were absolutely right to call your wife out for being responsible for that.\n\nI don't wish to be too harsh on your wife. Grief is hard and two years can feel like yesterday. But your wife needs to get a handle on this for the sake of the family unit. Bereavement counselling is a must at this point.", "NTA, your wife could push away your kids to where they don\u2019t want to be around/hangout/bond with her.", "ESH", "NTA your wife needs therapy", "NTA, everybody grieves in their own way but your wife probably needs some help getting past some of the stages.", "NTA.", "I'd say NAH. Your wife hasn't yet been able to come to terms with her loss, and you're right for wanting happy family occasions to stay happy. She has to learn to deal with this, as it's affecting other people.\n\nI often have \"it's so sad\" moments, even though it's 30 years since my parents died and I think at the time I coped with their deaths pretty well.

Your wife isn\u2019t seeing the impact she\u2019s having on her family, she\u2019s not taking responsibility for how her mental state impacts the stability of everyone around her. She\u2019s doing nothing to help herself and show her love for her surviving family, who are flat out asking her to show up for them the way they need her to. She\u2019s being a bad role model tbh. It\u2019s a bit selfish, I bet her mom wouldn\u2019t be happy to be have remembrance tainted like this and being something that\u2019s coming between her daughter and grandkids.\n\nShe\u2019s entitled to her grief, and I get it, it\u2019s a complex emotion without a timeline. She needs help with that grief though so she can process it in a healthy safe space that doesn\u2019t negatively impact her kids. It seems an indulgence to not even seek help so you can support your own children. I imagine at least one of them are going to have unhealthy coping mechanisms where they clam up and don\u2019t share their own hardships because they don\u2019t want to be a burden\u2026", "NTA. My gran died January 2nd 1999, a few hours after we'd seen her. My mother ruined every new year's celebration (and probably still does, I went no contact with her a couple of years ago) and made every happy occasion sad because she got so upset her mother wasn't there.

Your wife is going to end up with 3 kids who resent her if she doesn't get the help she needs.", "OP you or your daughter are definitely not AHs. I don't think your wife is either. Grief can be ugly, and therapy is 1) expensive 2) time consuming 3) daunting especially if it's not something you've done before 4) your wife may feel that no one, therapist included, will understand what she's going through. (I'm not questioning the benefits of therapy btw, just trying to look at it from your wife's perspective). Yep, suffering is not logical, it's not exactly news.\nDid your wife try any local support groups? Does she have any friends who lost loved ones - maybe she can talk to them? Is she religious? Can she try and express her feelings through art - maybe a painting or creative writing course would be a good idea? \nAnd yep you should try and get your daughter into therapy. Not to learn how to tiptoe around your wife, but to help your daughter sort through her own thoughts and feelings. Losing her grandma and living with a grieving mum for years is no picnic.", "NTA. But your wife isn\u2019t either. She deserves grief counseling and if you truly have been gentle with her that\u2019s not being asshole. Also you are trying to asses what is best for the team - the fam. Best of luck.", "NTA. The wishing your loved one wasn\u2019t there doesn\u2019t go away but you can\u2019t take away other people\u2019s happy moments because you don\u2019t feel happy. My dad died when I was a kid and I miss him every Christmas, at my siblings weddings, every promotion & academic achievement, etc. I don\u2019t make everyone else join me in that, I can acknowledge my loss in my head.", "OP suggested getting help. It\u2019s not help she isn\u2019t getting, it\u2019s help she refusing. There really isn\u2019t winning in this situation. She needs professional help to better her mental health, but refuses to get it. Everyone has a breaking point, and it seems the family has found theirs. \n\nSupporting people\u2019s mental health is important, but when it starts negatively impacting everyone around them, things have to change. It\u2019s impacting at least their oldest daughter, and if it hasn\u2019t already affected their 2nd, it will soon. Grief is a difficult thing to navigate, but OPs responsibility is to the kids first. While unintentional, wife is hurting her children. \n\nNobody expects her to \u201cget over\u201d her mom, and it seems like she\u2019s had plenty of support from the people around her. Her family has done what they can and shouldn\u2019t have to constantly cater to her grief. If her daughter can\u2019t even enjoy her birthday, which is a day specially meant to celebrate her, then I can imagine every event has a mention of her mom. \n\nI\u2019m someone who fully supports mental health, but I also know that you can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t want to be helped. The entire family shouldn\u2019t have to accommodate what is essentially her issue. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the kids have stopped grieving and instead become annoyed when grandma is mentioned because of this, which would be unfortunate. Essentially, people are probably trying to get her help, but she\u2019s refusing. Probably because of her poor mental state, but still.

That seems a poor decision on both their parts. \n\nIt's really important for people to get therapy, but it's not a sticking plaster. You have to be ready. If she isn't ready that's OK, I agree it's not OK for the kids to be being affected like this.\n\n I just think that she isn't an arsehole, she's very unwell.", "They didn\u2019t say get over it by now. My dad has been dead 11 years and I\u2019ll never get over it but I made conscious decision from the start to silently grieve him on big events likes birthdays and christmases because he would be mortified if he knew his death was casting a shadow over everything. \n\n\n\nIf it gets to the stage where your 12 year old daughter is asking you not to mention her dead grandma just once when she turns 13 you\u2019ve got issues that need to be dealt with.", "JESUS CHRIST", "\ud83d\ude33", "My dad bought a gift that he said was something my brother would have picked out.

I lost my grandfather when my eldest child was 2, and my two youngest children never got to meet him.  But they 'know' him through stories.  I was talking to my daughter only a couple of nights ago about how he made her a doll cot before I was ever pregnant with her, because he was worried he wouldn't be capable by the time I had a daughter.\n\nI've talked to my daughter before about how he would have loved her, and she would have him wrapped around her little finger.  She had forgotten about the cot, but she did remember that.\n\nI only have one real memory of my great-grandfather, but there are plenty of stories.\n\nMake the talk about lost ones positive, rather than focusing on what is missing."]}
