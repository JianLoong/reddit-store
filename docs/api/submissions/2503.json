Her way of handling my grandma passing away was not to talk about her. At family dinners she wouldn\u2019t bring up my grandma.

That NO ONE is invalidating her grief, but rather that you want her to have better tools to help her COPE with it, because she clearly isn't, and it's not right that her inability to cope with that grief is causing your children serious anxiety. I think that another commenter was right that if she still refuses to get help at that point, that you make it clear that you and the kids will be seeing a therapist without her, because she is breaking your family with her behaviour, and if she won't get help, you and the children need coping strategies of your own to deal with this.  \n\nYou are NTA. I'm sorry that it has reached this point.", "It's possible that your wife is suffering from postpartum depression.  \nI don't know if that's the case but all the pre and post pregnancy hormones combined with the grief could be exacerbating the problem.", "NTA - she needs help.  Can\u2019t even see she is alienating the children.  This is just sad.", "NTA.  She's the one who refused to go to therapy.", "NTA.", "I haven't lost my parents but we all will eventually lose our parents. They can't live forever. My grandma had alzheimer's disease and I was her caregiver.  It was hard losing her. It's amazing how attached you can become to someone who didn't even know who you are. She called me auntie, sister, mama and grandma. I think about her constantly. My first child was born 3 months before she passed and my two other children never got to meet her. You can't wallow in what you've lost cause when your to strapped up in your own grief and pain, you can't see the pain you are causing other people. You turn their special moments into sad memories. Your wife needs help.", "My grandmother passed away just a couple of months after my daughter was born. Grandma that I was named after, closer to than I would say my own mother, that I then named my daughter after. She never got to meet my daughter and it makes me sad. I think about it on holidays and birthdays, makes me tear up. But nobody else realizes it. Because those days are about the family that's left.", "NTA. \nMy father died 2 months before my son was born, and he passed in a way that was very traumatic for my husband and I. I'd be lying if I said it didn't make a lot important moments bittersweet for us. It's totally normal to think of our loved ones at big moments and family celebrations, but it's not normal or healthy to let that ruin things for everyone every time. I doubt that's what her mom would have wanted for her family when she passed away. \nI would definitely suggest trying to talk to her again about grief counseling, or maybe a support group for people who have been through similar things.", "NTA.  Your wife is certainly stuck in her grieving process.  Her grief is affecting the whole family, your baby may never know a childhood \"happy\" birthday if your wife doesn't move through her grief.  It may be time to insist on couples counseling as a way to get her some grief counseling.  Don't mention her grief as a problem, just tell her you Leo her but there are a few things troubling you.  Maybe you can say its about being a little overwhelmed by the new baby. The key may be to approach this as a marriage tune up/couples counseling thing, an \"us\" problem not a \"her\" problem.   Then let your wife and the counselor \"discover\" the effect her grief is having on her and your family.  Best of luck to you all.   I can see you love your wife and kids, and just want to have a happy family again.", "NTA, leaning towards NAH because like... I don't know how much I can fault your wife when she's like... clearly not okay?\n\nIf it's just her redirecting attention to herself, that's one thing. But if we choose to interpret her actions in a way that isn't really cynical, she needs to get some help to deal with the trauma of losing her mother. Trauma comes in lots of different forms, and losing a loved one to cancer *is* traumatic. If she hasn't processed or handled that grief, she needs to. It's isolating her from her family.", "NTA: but your wife isn\u2019t either, I think she messed up out of trauma reaction. She absolutely needs grief counselling and she owes your daughter a conversation and apology, but this seems a little dismissive of the grief she\u2019s experiencing. \n\nThe thing is you shouldn\u2019t have said what you said. When you lose someone, every milestone feels bittersweet, sometimes just bitter. I lost my big sister last year, and every good thing that happens is accompanied by enormous amounts grief (and I\u2019m in counselling). To have a milestone occur without the presence of your favourite people being around to join is one of the worst things one can experience. She loved her mom so much, and loves her daughter, she clearly is thinking about how much love would have been shared and was just sad that it couldn\u2019t happen. The comment didn\u2019t seem overly emotional, she was just expressing that her mom would have been proud. From her perspective she probably felt she was giving a compliment to you daughter. That shouldn\u2019t have warranted that bad of a reaction imo, she didn\u2019t cry and ruin the happiness. The idea she can\u2019t ever mention her mom in a positive light is unfair to her.\n\nShe might feel alone in her grief. I do agree she needs counselling, but as her husband you need to let her feel what she\u2019s feeling. Maybe ask if she wants to spend time looking through photos and talking about some favourite memories you all had with her mom, that can help kickstart the grieving process if she\u2019s been putting it off.\n\nIf she is emotional, she needs to learn when to excuse herself if she\u2019s in the company of people who aren\u2019t capable of supporting her through those moments, just sucks her family can\u2019t be those people for her.\n\nI think it would be worth talking to your daughter about how she might feel in her moms position so she can be a little bit more understanding of what your wife is going through, and then your wife can also apologize for failing to take the right steps to ensure her mental state is good for her family. Both are valid positions, but I really would like to stress that grief does a lot to your brain, and no one seems to be taking that into consideration, seems like you all want her to shut up and she\u2019s just missing her mom. Overall sad situation.", "NAH\n\nSo they say anxiety has to do with worrying about the future and depression has to do with looking and being stuck in the past. She needs therapy because she's hanging on to that loop she has stuck in her head of her mom dying in her head and its going to make her depressed. I would know, I became depressed after my mom died which is common but I didn't have people encouraging to go to therapy. Does she see going to a therapist as a stigma?", "Yeah, wife's grief is very understandable but it seems like she's tainting the memory of grandma for her daughter and the rest of the family.", "Uh... I don't get this take. Why should the rest of the family, who by all accounts seem to be doing fine be the ones who have to put in all the effort to tiptoe around mom who *refuses* to get help for her obvious issues? It's been two years. Two years of OP trying to tell her to get help and of the kids hearing about their dead grandma on every special ocassion. The person who needs help is the person creating the problem. As long as she doesn't get help, things aren't going to get better for those around her. Why should they have to figure out how to \"redirect\" their mom's behaviour? They're kids, not trained therapists.", "My issue with the wife is that this is obviously has become a bigger issue. The fact that the child had to ask must mean that this happens way to often. She can talk about it but imagine that every time they are trying to celebrate, her mother\u2019s death is brought up. As you said, \u201cappropriate times\u201d.", "Yeah, my heart broke a bit for the wife who must feel like everyone around her doesn\u2019t get why she won\u2019t get over it by now. I\u2019m sympathetic to the family but she must feel so alone.", "Because you can\u2019t change the way someone else behaves but you can change the way you respond. This suggestion is to give the kids coping mechanisms for something the can\u2019t change.", "As someone who lives with a partner with depression, anxiety and adhd I can attest it\u2019s never what they can do it\u2019s about what you do around their condition. None of this manifested itself until she became a mom but now it\u2019s a cloud over our entire house and if you dare to ask the person suffering to possibly change something about them get ready for a tsunami of emotions coming back at you for not being supportive.", "I agree, I think my mom feels the same as OPs wife but doesn\u2019t vocalize the missing her part. That definitely causes issues as there seems to be a cloud over everything. \n\nThis is a very complex issue and won\u2019t be solved overnight. Even my mom and aunt had to have a few discussions until all of the feelings were properly addressed.", "She wouldn't need therapy such of she had family being more supportive, saying they think of her too, and moving on with occasions instead of shutting down. \n\nOp says she brings it up, not that she bawls over it. Hopefully,  the kids don't have a lot of experience with loss, yet. It's a learning experience for them in how to manage it.", "Actually, it's not something that can't be changed. OP can leave his wife and take his kids if she continues to refuse to get help for her issues. It might be beneficial for the kids to be away from that kind of negativity and having to walk on eggshells around their mom.", "As someone with depression anxiety ADD and ADHD  I can attest that it is up to you to better yourself get help and not drag others down with you. And helping get someone into therapy is being supportive. Allowing someone to push off their negativity onto others is NOT supportive and NOT acceptable especially with children involved", "A supportive family doesn\u2019t replace what a therapist can do. Them being supportive definitely helps, but a therapist is trained to help their patients navigate their feelings. The family isn\u2019t trained and can only help so much.", "Or, instead of blowing up their family, they could try therapy before they go nuclear.\n\nYou're acting like the person who goes to therapy \"loses\" somehow.  Most people can benefit from therapy.", "Oh you don\u2019t know me. She\u2019s in therapy she\u2019s on meds she does group counseling. We do absolutely everything we can as a family absolutely EVERYTHING but they day before vacation and mom doesn\u2019t want to go because she\u2019s not feeling good and also doesn\u2019t want us to go because then we would be deserting her and it costing us $5k is tough to explain to kids."]}
