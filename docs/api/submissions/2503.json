Her way of handling my grandma passing away was not to talk about her. At family dinners she wouldn\u2019t bring up my grandma.

That NO ONE is invalidating her grief, but rather that you want her to have better tools to help her COPE with it, because she clearly isn't, and it's not right that her inability to cope with that grief is causing your children serious anxiety. I think that another commenter was right that if she still refuses to get help at that point, that you make it clear that you and the kids will be seeing a therapist without her, because she is breaking your family with her behaviour, and if she won't get help, you and the children need coping strategies of your own to deal with this.  \n\nYou are NTA. I'm sorry that it has reached this point.", "It's possible that your wife is suffering from postpartum depression.  \nI don't know if that's the case but all the pre and post pregnancy hormones combined with the grief could be exacerbating the problem.", "NTA - she needs help.

She's the one who refused to go to therapy.", "NTA.", "I haven't lost my parents but we all will eventually lose our parents. They can't live forever. My grandma had alzheimer's disease and I was her caregiver.  It was hard losing her. It's amazing how attached you can become to someone who didn't even know who you are. She called me auntie, sister, mama and grandma. I think about her constantly. My first child was born 3 months before she passed and my two other children never got to meet her. You can't wallow in what you've lost cause when your to strapped up in your own grief and pain, you can't see the pain you are causing other people. You turn their special moments into sad memories. Your wife needs help.", "My grandmother passed away just a couple of months after my daughter was born. Grandma that I was named after, closer to than I would say my own mother, that I then named my daughter after. She never got to meet my daughter and it makes me sad. I think about it on holidays and birthdays, makes me tear up. But nobody else realizes it. Because those days are about the family that's left.", "NTA. \nMy father died 2 months before my son was born, and he passed in a way that was very traumatic for my husband and I. I'd be lying if I said it didn't make a lot important moments bittersweet for us. It's totally normal to think of our loved ones at big moments and family celebrations, but it's not normal or healthy to let that ruin things for everyone every time. I doubt that's what her mom would have wanted for her family when she passed away. \nI would definitely suggest trying to talk to her again about grief counseling, or maybe a support group for people who have been through similar things.", "NTA.  Your wife is certainly stuck in her grieving process.  Her grief is affecting the whole family, your baby may never know a childhood \"happy\" birthday if your wife doesn't move through her grief.  It may be time to insist on couples counseling as a way to get her some grief counseling.  Don't mention her grief as a problem, just tell her you Leo her but there are a few things troubling you.  Maybe you can say its about being a little overwhelmed by the new baby. The key may be to approach this as a marriage tune up/couples counseling thing, an \"us\" problem not a \"her\" problem.   Then let your wife and the counselor \"discover\" the effect her grief is having on her and your family.  Best of luck to you all.   I can see you love your wife and kids, and just want to have a happy family again.", "NTA, leaning towards NAH because like... I don't know how much I can fault your wife when she's like... clearly not okay?\n\nIf it's just her redirecting attention to herself, that's one thing. But if we choose to interpret her actions in a way that isn't really cynical, she needs to get some help to deal with the trauma of losing her mother. Trauma comes in lots of different forms, and losing a loved one to cancer *is* traumatic. If she hasn't processed or handled that grief, she needs to. It's isolating her from her family.", "NTA: but your wife isn\u2019t either, I think she messed up out of trauma reaction. She absolutely needs grief counselling and she owes your daughter a conversation and apology, but this seems a little dismissive of the grief she\u2019s experiencing. \n\nThe thing is you shouldn\u2019t have said what you said. When you lose someone, every milestone feels bittersweet, sometimes just bitter. I lost my big sister last year, and every good thing that happens is accompanied by enormous amounts grief (and I\u2019m in counselling). To have a milestone occur without the presence of your favourite people being around to join is one of the worst things one can experience. She loved her mom so much, and loves her daughter, she clearly is thinking about how much love would have been shared and was just sad that it couldn\u2019t happen. The comment didn\u2019t seem overly emotional, she was just expressing that her mom would have been proud. From her perspective she probably felt she was giving a compliment to you daughter. That shouldn\u2019t have warranted that bad of a reaction imo, she didn\u2019t cry and ruin the happiness. The idea she can\u2019t ever mention her mom in a positive light is unfair to her.\n\nShe might feel alone in her grief. I do agree she needs counselling, but as her husband you need to let her feel what she\u2019s feeling. Maybe ask if she wants to spend time looking through photos and talking about some favourite memories you all had with her mom, that can help kickstart the grieving process if she\u2019s been putting it off.\n\nIf she is emotional, she needs to learn when to excuse herself if she\u2019s in the company of people who aren\u2019t capable of supporting her through those moments, just sucks her family can\u2019t be those people for her.\n\nI think it would be worth talking to your daughter about how she might feel in her moms position so she can be a little bit more understanding of what your wife is going through, and then your wife can also apologize for failing to take the right steps to ensure her mental state is good for her family. Both are valid positions, but I really would like to stress that grief does a lot to your brain, and no one seems to be taking that into consideration, seems like you all want her to shut up and she\u2019s just missing her mom. Overall sad situation.", "NAH\n\nSo they say anxiety has to do with worrying about the future and depression has to do with looking and being stuck in the past.

Your wife had her mom when humans need parents. Their relationship was probably so good because her entire childhood wasn't a real time in memoriam show.

But I don\u2019t know if this would work and a therapist might have better ideas on how to approach this.  I think you already know she is clinging to the grief.  Her actions could be because she is stuck in the grief.  But it could be more complex and rooted in a desire for attention.  So I don\u2019t think pressure on her ie threats of divorce if you don\u2019t go to therapy would be very helpful.  She seems to lack self awareness.

Losing a parent at that stage of life (wife, not the deceased mother) is extremely hard and the grief does take over life for a while, especially the first year when you have to have the \u201cfirsts\u201d. First holidays, birthdays, births, etc. The second year is really hard too, because now you know how hard those events are going to be without your loved one there too.

If talking about grandma makes her daughter sad and the mom knows this, why would you bring it up? \n\n\"I know you're celebrating your Bday sweetie, but I don't want you to forget that grandma would've loved to be here, but she cant bc she's dead.\" \n\nThat's what the 13 year old is hearing, and she made one ask for her b day and the mom couldn't even do that. I dont know any 13 year old that wants to talk about that in the midst of celebrating their own life. How do you expect the kids to be open to counseling when the mom point blank refuses counseling for herself? I don't think people truly ever get over losing their loved one's, they just find different ways to cope. The daughter's way may involve remembering her grandma privately, while its obvious the mom prefers to do so openly. Both should be respected. In this situation, the parent should have listen to her child, her daughter isn't even talking to her right now.", "I went to therapy because of the damage my parents did for not getting therapy themselves so I had to learn how to cope and redirect because I know they weren\u2019t gonna change so I had to learn how to deal with that and how to handle it.. seems pretty standard if you know so much about therapy"]}
