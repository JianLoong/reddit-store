I'm Canadian and even for me 16C is too cold. \n\nWhat's the guy's problem? Does he control other parts of the house and relationship?", "NTA. Do not understand it any more than you do.  Controlling the thermostat, claiming it is about saving money seems to be guy thing.  It makes no sense to me and i never hear about women doing this.

And no, that is NOT okay. Sweet jeez, I come from extreme poverty in childhood, and I'm a crazy frugal adult. I keep it at 68. I would never go below 65, or I would feel like a horrible parent.
