If they kept us at 60oF you could use for breach of contract (and that temperature is set by states). 60 is insane, especially for a baby!", "I did the conversion and was like wtf.  I recently tried to go down to 66F and was chilly.  Went back to 69F which to me is comfy, thought I gotta wear a jacket after a shower lol", "Yup!\n\nGrowing up my dad would set the thermostat to 17 degrees. Used to drive me CRAZY. It was an old house, my room was a corner roon and so was my parents so we each had 2 walls with windows, but my parents had 2 heaters whereas I had 1. My father was overweight and there were 2 of them so I get how that room would get warm but I'd literally FREEZE. I'd sleep with a heating pad in my room (my dad tried to encourage a space heater but as a young adult that was a volunteer fire fighter that made me nervous) but I'd still be cold.\n\nAs an adult who lives on her own I REFUSE to be cold in my house. I will ALWAYS pay for heat.\n\nOP is definitely not the asshole.", "I really like this idea.  Telling his parents his ridiculous claims about how he lived with them is a fair strategy here.", "Nah, with the baby in the picture even if he was paying the full bill he cannot be setting it to 16C.", "Everywhere else in the world except America uses celsius, even Canada lol", "/r/ShitAmericansSay", "Seems like you\u2019re talking from experience", "I wish there was a way to keep one of their guest rooms at 16 ... and put all his crap in it, along with an air mattress.\n\nWho deep freezes a baby?", "He literally refuses to listen making an excuse every time,he's stubborn and isnt going to work. He literally thinks the whole house needs to be his preference not caring for the others in the home. His selfishness and insistance to freeze his housemates is what will destroy the relationship. \n\nPlus,he lied.", "If you're somewhere where it dips below freezing, you shouldn't go lower than 55.\n\nWe had a terrible cold snap over Christmas. So many people turned their heat completely off before going on vacation and came back home to wrecked houses because the pipes burst.", "My family is the same, I woke up once and could see my breath in my bedroom. A little cold puts some hustle in your step in the mornings. It was an old house though where the heater would just run non-stop. \n\nNow I have my own house, 58 degrees getting wild over here. I do keep downstairs at a balmy 64-68 degrees.", "I swear I have blood made of lava because that sounds like heaven to me. But I know I'd freeze my husband to death if I had the aircon at that temperature. Plus the bill would be insane. I visited England once. It was 8\u00b0c and raining and I was in pure bliss. Then I came home to Australia and the second I stepped outside I just about cried. I hate hot weather. I hate living somewhere the sun wants to kill me.", "I.do.68, but 63 at night. 60.is crazy!", "We do too (because that's what the wife wants and it's not a hill to die on as far as I'm concerned), but honestly, I'd prefer it if we kept it colder. I grew up in the 70s/80s in a house without central heat in the frigid midwest (during winter, we would jockey for position to stand with our backs against the furnace in the partition between the kitchen and living room area, which was the only source of heat in the main house). Back then, I wore warm clothes inside because that furnace couldn't possibly keep the whole house toasty. Now, I wear shorts and t-shirts to avoid overheating and honestly think it's a bit ridiculous.", "60F is okay for adults, but not a 1yr old. My house is like that, but we don't have kids. If we did, the house would definitely be warmer! Definitely NTA!", "Where the heck are you getting that from? Why would mold grow? Mold needs humidity. \n\nWe keep a temp of 18.5 \u00b0C during the day and 16 at night. We're a slippers and sweater house, we like using a throw blanket on the couch. Otherwise, we're moving around the house and don't need it to be tropical. Our house isn't cold by any stretch of the imagination.", "Dear...heat is a basic need. You and your baby are sick. His fixation is with creating an unsafe environment and you need to ask yourself why. Because this isn't normal. \n\n\nNTA", "My officemates do this too, every day when I come in to work in our tiny tiny office it's sweltering in there, and stuffy as hell.", "https://www.webmd.com/baby/what-is-the-right-room-temperature-for-a-baby#:~:text=Babies%20are%20more%20sensitive%20to,just%20like%20older%20humans%20do.\n\nBabies literally can't regulate through own temp for awhile", "My son and I are both very sensitive to heat, so we keep it at 65 in the winter and 69 in the summer.", "Ours is set around 62, but my menopause is set at 75, I swear.", "Unless you live in an extremely dry part of the world. Mold is not really a concern.", "Bangs her I suppose.", "I keep mine at 69, I haven't noticed a price increase versus last year.  I live in the US", "Did he actually want it at 68 or was he gunning for that compromise?", "My dad has always been insane about the temp too, but never likes it THAT cold. It\u2019s not because of saving money, but because he gets hot. But I will say, my parents have been together for 40 years and it has been and always will be an ongoing battle between them. I\u2019d seriously suggest couples counseling to talk out this specific issue, or you\u2019ve got a long road of bickering ahead of you. \n\nPs. Your husband is def TA and he sounds weirdly controlling. Just look out for yourself and baby, and leave to a hotel or family if you have to prove a point.", "I think the secret is out!", "\ud83e\udd8e\ud83e\udea8\u2600\ufe0f", "Why are you risking yours and the baby\u2019s health? Your conversations aren\u2019t working. You might have to move somewhere a bit warmer for the sake of your baby and only move back in if this thermostat issue never happens again.", "So neither of you care about the sick kid, cool."]}
