I told him that I was willing to pay more to keep the house at what I feel is a safe temperature for our daughter. His response to that has been that we were \u201cobviously raised differently because he was taught to be conservative with money\u201d, or \u201cgrowing up in my house, my parents always kept the house cold and we just had to deal with it and put on a sweater\u201d. \n\nThese comments pissed me off whenever he said them because, his family is wealthy, and always has been.

They said that 16 was not acceptable, especially in a home with a baby. I didn\u2019t bring this up with him because I didn\u2019t want him to think I was trying to get them involved. I legit wanted to know since they raised 3 children. \n\nFlash forward to a few minutes ago and I go downstairs because despite the layers of socks, sweaters and blankets, I\u2019m still cold. Mind you, my daughter and I are also both sick with a cold right now. So I check the thermostat and it is, again at 16. \n\nI lose it, raising my voice, asking him why after multiple conversations and arguments he cannot do what he fucking promises he will do. I remind him that I pay the bill, and that his daughter and I are sick.
