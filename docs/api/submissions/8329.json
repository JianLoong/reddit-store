She does actually work for you. That\u2019s how hiring someone works. Also, how else would you say this?

Give her a chance to speak but also say your peice. I mean of i booked anyone for a certain time, a little leeway is fine, but calling a paying customer to tell them oh I've picked up an extra job so I can't be there till 2? That's rude to me.

Ridiculous", "No. In no way shape or form are you the AH.", "NTA in this case you are the employer and she is the employee. An employer who pays their employee has every right to expect said employee to be present during working hours.

It's like they forget that customer demand and needs are why they are able to do these gigs.

There should be an expectation of service when it's scheduled. \n\nI would find a new cleaner.", "I'm gonna be harsh here, but she is most likely a very self conscious young woman, not used to talking in professional settings, getting butthurt over an older person using the term \"expect\" on her. Like parents do. That's probably the context she associate to that word \"i expected more from you, young lady!\" said by her father. \n\nSo yeah, she is a pretty unprofessional, uneducated kid jumping to conclusion due to her own ignorance and her self consciousness about her (percieved) low level position.", "TIL Francophone", "My dad hired a biweekly cleaner to help us out. In the nearly year we've worked with her she has not *once* shown up on time, and I mean *hours* late each time, not just 20-30minutes occasionally. \nShe's even made it a habit to stay *hours* past the time limit she agreed to, to clean things outside of what we've asked (ex: going through and reorganizing our food pantry twice).\nI work full time nights, and obviously need to sleep during the day. My dad was honest that if she wanted to work with us, she'd have to adhere to a pretty strict schedule due to mine. He and I both understood that could be a tough agreement for someone to stick to, we gave her our expectations and the option to say no, yet she agreed, happily.\nWe're very close to finding someone else due to her abhorrent and unprofessional behavior, dad let her know this recently. \nShe's now taken to showing up (still late) and berating me in my own home for how \"absolutely effing ridiculous your dad is being about this time limit bs\" \n\nOP is absolutely NTA. \nA professional agreement, is a professional agreement.\nShould this agreement need to be altered, it's absolutely a reasonable expectation that this is communicated properly.", "Exactly. I would just tell them to not come again if I got a message like this.\n\n\"You're right, you don't work for me... anymore! I will be hiring someone else from now on.\"", "I also get frequently booked from a platform for pet sitting services. I'm a contract worker and I work for myself, but if somebody books me for a specific time I'm not going to take another client for the same time period. That's rude and disrespectful. Somebody books me for 10:00 a.m. It's not okay to tell them I'll be by 2:00 p.m.", "I have cleaners. We are constantly changing days and times. Life happens.\n\n>Hi [tinawebmom] I have a lady call in sick I apologize for any inconvenience but can we do Thursday around 2pm?\n\nThat's this week. She gives me notice as soon as she knows. It's always polite. When she arrives she'll apologize yet again.\n\nShe's also on a platform. She blocks the times as she schedules homes. Why? Because it's professional!!", "*affected gasp* you are saying that she works for money? omg. no. she works for HERSELF. You monster!\n\n/s", "What I enjoy is this:\n\n> my platform just added a morning job to my schedule\n\n...\n\n> she's not my employee, she works for herself\n\nIt's \"the platform\" when the gig with OP is preempted, but \"I work for myself\" when he points out she's not doing what they agreed to.", "You are more polite than me, I would probably just laughed at her generous offer, LOL", "Especially when, though she didn't use the word \"expect,\" she communicated her garbage *expectations* that rescheduling four hours later with 20 minutes notice was totally fine. People have expectations for professional agreements, showing up at the agreed upon time is a reasonable expectation, unilaterally rescheduling with almost no notice is not a reasonable expectation. \n\nAnd \"I don't work for you\" cool, bro not anymore, don't show up at 2 and I don't pay you anymore if that's where we are at.", "And the \"I don't work for you\" comment.\n\nUhh... yes you do? That's why I pay you? Tf?", "What the OP wrote is probably better than what I would have said which would be \"oh, don't come at all then, I'll look for someone who can do the times I need\".", "She clearly doesn't know how to conduct herself in an independent contractor roll. At this rate she won't have a business.", "I am a lawyer and, if I agree to meet my clients, I apologise if I\u2019m a minute late. I would _expect_ the same from anyone, in any profession.", "NTA and she admits it's to do another job!  I mean if she was having car trouble or an accident it would be understandable but to give away your time slot for another job, wow. I wonder if she got paid more?", "I expect OP can easily find a new housekeeper. Or better yet, hire her through the cleaning agency where she almost certainly gets less money per job than she does freelance.", "My daughter was training a fresh out of highschool employee once. Within the first hour she told the person, \"You need to pay attention to which bin you put the items in.\"\n\nThe trainee  replied \"You're not my dad; you can't tell me what to do\" and walked out without even letting anyone know that they were quitting.\n\nI wonder how that young person is doing in life.", "Yes, this wording changes everything!", "Really only seeing ESH. I guess the YTA\u2019s were deleted? Seems like there\u2019s always a ton of attention given to YTA comments and I can never find them because I\u2019m late to the party", "Maybe that's how painters work, but not how I work. I install floor covering, build custom tile showers, and other things. There are times I have a small job scheduled, and a more profitable job will come up. I don't cancel, I keep my word and my commitments. Many of those small jobs have turned into long-standing and profitable customers. And they have gotten me other customers from word of mouth.", "It's like she \"expected\" him to be alright w the change", "That's not necessarily true. My mom cleans houses. She let's herself in. She likes to clean when nobody's home. Sounds weird, but then nobody is in your way or hovering over you. Plus she likes to turn the heat down because she is working hard. But anyway, yeah, she has keys or they leave it unlocked or she has the codes", "This is what makes me wonder if OP and the cleaner speak the same mother tongue. Is it possible that whilst the cleaner speaks English their mother tongue is a different language and there is a language barrier? Maybe expect is close to another word in their language that is more charged with a different meaning??\nI was once at a job where a building caught fire and an employee texted the director of the company saying the fire looked \"impressive\". Turns out in their mother tongue a similar word to impressive means something like shocking/huge and they didn't realise in English it was a word with a positive meaning. \nI also had a Spanish colleague ask another colleague if he was still \"constipated\" when he was recovering from a cold. Apparently in Spain \"constipado\" means to have a blocked nose.... So not the same meaning", "As someone who is self-employed providing a service to clients, this stuck out to me, too. I know for myself, it was a big point of pride and satisfaction when I transitioned to being a business owner from an employee. However, my clients don\u2019t really have a different experience. Nor should they. I think this woman has confused \u201cnot having to put up with an employer\u201d to \u201cnot having to put up with anyone.\u201d I guess she is right, but she\u2019s going to lose her clients if they are not allowed to have any professional expectations from hiring her.", "She seems thinks that her client that pays her need to adjust around her schedule. the entitlement here is strong! I wouldn't be surprised that she recorded the entire conversation as a flex & post it all over tiktok.", "The real difference is that a freelancer has a bunch of bosses to answer to instead of just one. When I'm writing, my editor is still my boss for that job. I signed a contract. There are absolutely consequences if I were to miss deadlines or produce poor quality work or otherwise violate our agreements.", "Yes! It's called courtesy and mutual respect", "LMAO there was someone who posted on this subreddit recently, asking if he was the asshole for yelling at his dad and threatening to cut him out of his life, but the dude was living with him as an adult and still financially dependant. If that was my kid, he might find himself sleeping in his car for the night and contemplating whether this is the choice he really wants to make.", "Especially considering one off clients are more likely to skip on the bill or take forever to pay as compared to a regular customer who has a history of paying on time.", "I imagine that she feels that she can set/change the time since she is self employed. Being that this is a job that has to be scheduled, her approach was extremely unprofessional.", "Yeah, I think it\u2019s common to work with a certain amount of flexibility around the time, but I\u2019m sure your mom and any other competent professional discusses it well prior with the client, they don\u2019t just assume they will be fine with it. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP\u2019s housecleaner is an AH for wanting to change the time, but she is an AH for demanding it last-minute (and for yelling at her client when he reasonably pushed back, of course).", "Yes really, it would be one thing if a last minute emergency popped up and she's apologetic about it, shit happens.   But this was her basically double booking, and it was avoidable.  Either she's allowed to set \"busy\" times in her scheduling company for her own side work, OR she needs to make it clear to her \"side clients\" that she needs them to be flexible in hours because she's \"on call\" and may sometimes need to reschedule.   But that shit needs to be agreed upon beforehand, not 20 minutes before an appointment.", "I\u2019m a business owner and you\u2019d be shocked (or not) how often people tell me how lucky I am to \u201cwork for myself\u201d. I get what they\u2019re saying but - ever hear of customers? I work for them lol. They are, in fact, the boss of me, assuming I\u2019d like them to pay us.", "1st off she's unprofessional AND so rude without doubt. Let's get that out of the way first and foremost.\n\nI think.... she's on a payroll (permanent employment) with an agency (the platform she mentioned), and she does some (maybe unreported income) work on the side when there are gaps in her schedule I think? Hence her schedules set by her platform are her priority, so she puts every side jobs as to be performed after she's done with her main job?\n\nThis what comes to my mind. But yeah she's just unprofessional.", "Yup, 100% agree. \"Expect\" is the correct word. At work a very common phrase is \"managing expectations\" and there is nothing offensive there.\n\nAnd she was working for him. Not a salary kind of work, but gig/contract work is still work.", "I resemble that remark.", "Exactly. No reason to worry about paying someone if you're never going to use their services again, and if you're a smaller business, it can be hard to collect on those debts.", "I'd be tempted to reply that if you don't work for me, then I won't pay you.", "I'd be tempted to reply that if you don't work for me, then I won't pay you.", "hah yea that's so freaking crazy.   I shared a room with my little brother until my littlest brother was old enough to sleep on the bottom bunk of the bunk beds.  There is NOTHING wrong with sharing a room with your sibling, other than if a sibling is doing something they're not supposed to (sexual abuse) obviously that's the exception.", "It's funny because in French demande is ask, so opposite confusion", "\u201cThis person does not respect the time agreed, she does not care about their already assigned clients, she is rude and irresponsible. I do not recommend her at all since her job and her person aren\u2019t trustworthy\u201d", "True, but I'm not familiar with other languages she could potentially speak. And sometimes it's association and perceived context as opposed to direct translation. \n\nAt any rate, it's the only way I can rationalize her response in an understandable light.", "(Tee hee!)", "Maybe not\u2014 my experience with self-employed housekeepers involved them deviating from our set schedule, but they always contacted me well in advance and ASKED if such-and-such time would work. I\u2019m guessing this woman was used to working with that kind of flexibility but ironically, *expected* it from her clients with virtually no discussion.", "And I bet she EXPECTED him to pay her for her work, too. Expectations all around, I'd say. \n\nOP is NTA.", "Yeah, if she works for herself by her interpretation of those words, she can pay her own wages.", "Imagine other careers using this.\n\n\"Look, just because you paid for me to coordinate your wedding doesn't mean I work for you. I'm going to be 4 hours late.\"", "\"my platform just added a morning job to my schedule\" that doesn't sound self-employed, it sounds more like a franchise that is set up to online book or in the zoned area.", "I ordered a lawn mower online a couple years ago and was told my delivery window and that I'd have to sign. I sat right by the front door with the windows open so I could see when they arrived and be quick for them.\n\nSaw the FedEx truck pull up in front of my driveway. In less than a minute they drove off, driver never even got out of the truck. Moments later I got a notice that they'd attempted delivery but I wasn't there to sign.\n\nCalled FedEx ticked off, said it was a blatant lie and I had camera footage showing the driver made 0 attempt to even come to my door.

I was pleasant and thanked him and he just stormed off after I signed.", "Probably depends on whether your clients are mostly building sites, contractors, or flippers. Vs a business model focused on homeowners where you need to keep your ratings up. Sounds like you have the later so a focus on customer service is essential for success.", ">if someone did this to me I would never hire them again\n\nI'd probably also leave them a negative review on Angi or wherever. It's immensely disrespectful. If this was a corporate employer (for lack of a better term), y'know, one where you're scheduled for a shift at 10am, do you suddenly decide you're going to come at 2pm instead? That would get her fired, unless she called that morning in a panic saying she had to take her mother to the hospital or something.\n\nFor contract work like this, her clients are her employers. And those clients can ruin her business by giving her one-star reviews if she disregards their agreement.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, forgot the NTA.", "She clearly doesn't think it means anything.", "Exactly. Pay her half of what you agreed and see how quickly she says she expects to get paid what was agreed upon.", "Oh, you work for yourself? Do you pay yourself?"]}
