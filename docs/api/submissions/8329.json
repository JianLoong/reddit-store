She does actually work for you. That\u2019s how hiring someone works. Also, how else would you say this?

He booked her for 10 AM to clean and she has a professional obligation to clean. You don\u2019t expect a doctor or mechanic to come 4 hours late either.

If I have a verbal or written contract/agreement with anyone I expect them to uphold it and they expect me to pay them for their services.
