My obgyn says I have something \"that is not quite right\" and she asked me if I bleed during sex, which I sometimes do. Not sure if that's what she meant.

So rn they choose what I dress, how much money I spend, on what, what I eat, how much I eat (yesterday I ended up with bad diarrhea because I'm lactose intolerant and my mom didn't let me leave the table until I finish an unreasonable amount of chicken with cream) and so on. Right now I'm picking my battles. I know you're probably thinking I'm 29 and I should stand up for myself and I'm only taking it because I want to. All true. The problem is I have debt and it's complex to rent, even if my boyfriend would rent with me. We're trying to save up for now. But we have an agreement that if push comes to shove, we're renting a house and I'm moving out.

It's just the amount. I can feel when it's going from \"enough\" to \"too much\" because it affects my stomach before it gets to the intestine.
