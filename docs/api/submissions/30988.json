My brother Chris (37M) and sister in law Rachel (33F) have two kids 4F and 2M. I\u2019ve taken an extended maternity after my most recent delivery due to some complications and won\u2019t be back at work until after the new year. My husband went back when our little one was 4 months. \n\nChris and Rachel came to my husband and I about 2 months ago saying their daycare could no longer keep them as the center was closing unexpectedly and they were in a bind and asked if I could watch the kids while they worked. I told them I would be willing to so long as it was temporary and not long term. Both assured me they were seeking out a new center that could take them both. Both were appreciative of our help as they were told on a Wednesday the center\u2019s last day of operation would be that same Friday.\n\nThe first few weeks were fine but as it\u2019s been longer and longer, my husband and I are staring to doubt they are actually looking for a new center. They\u2019ve never offered to pay me for watching the kids, but I\u2019ve never asked either. Until this past weekend. We took all the kids to a park on Saturday and I spoke with my brother about whether or jot they had found a mew daycare. He said they had done some tours but were told there weren\u2019t spaces for the kids yet and had been wait listed. I told him I completely understood and reminded him me keeping the kids was supposed to be temporary. I asked him if he and Rachel could start paying me $100/week for both kids. He called me outrageous for even asking citing \u201cwe\u2019re family.\u201d \n\nI tried explaining how much more money my husband and I were spending having them in the house 5 days a week and he called me lazy for still being on leave when my baby is 8 months old. At this point, I told him I would no longer be watching the kids and not to bring them Monday (yesterday) morning. Since Saturday, Chris and Rachel have blasted Dustin and I on social media which has caused all kinds of friends and extended family to reach out, many calling us assholes amongst other things. Their post made them look like victims. When my mom reached out I explain the above and she\u2019s now on on mine and Dustin\u2019s side. Rachel, Rachel\u2019s sister, and my brother have continued to text Dustin and I about what selfish assholes we are for not helping them in their time of need. \n\nDustin and I are really having a hard time wrapping our heads around us being the assholes in this situation so we figured we\u2019d ask Reddit who the assholes are here.", "created_utc": 1700005432, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vfwfn/aita_for_refusing_to_continue_to_babysit_my_niece/", "score": 1450, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
