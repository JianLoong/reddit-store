But then again, I'm not ashamed of my periods or period accidents. But I know that some women would be mortified if this happened to them and to have it pointed out by a man would be even worse. As some other commenters have said, if you find yourself in this situation again, maybe just mention that they have a stain on their pants and then they can figure out the rest for themselves. Good luck with your manager tomorrow, I'm sure it's not going to be as bad as you think it's going to be.

We usually use \"double standard\" in english to refer to situations where the logical response SHOULD be the same, but its unfair bias making them different, like one twin sibling getting extra candy for doing their chores while the other twin gets nothing for the same chores. \n\nThe internet meme version of this concept is when someone says \"replace X with Y and i bet youd react different!!\", people sarcastically respond: \"changing a word in a sentence changes the meaning of the entire sentence!! breaking news!!!\" \n\nlike while the response wouldve been different if OP was a woman, its also notable that it probably wouldve been different if OP hypothetically was a trans man instead of a cis man (and if the coworker knew this of course) because the key here is \"someone who sympathizes because they likely have personal experience with the embarassing situation of bleeding through their pants\". It's simply more embarassing to have that pointed out by a cis man than it is anyone else, all other things being equal (like if the dude is a friend then thats preferred over a stranger of course, etc. It's not 100%.)\n\nedit to add another example LOL \n\nLets say you (a dude in this hypothetical, idk about you personally) ran a marathon, and because of the shirt you were wearing, your nipples start chafing and bleeding. the next day you go to a pool party to celebrate the marathon and someone notices that your nips are red and gives you advice on it. Surely you'd react differently if that was an experienced runner who is telling you what works for them compared to if it was someone who's never ran long distance but has read reddit posts about nipple chafing (like me lol). It's not personal to the people, it's just human nature to be less embarassed when you know the person pointing out the embarassing thing has also experienced it.

Fear is easy and gets immediate results, but people won't ever do more than they have to in order to avoid a punishment. Love, on the other hand, is harder to cultivate but builds trust, loyalty, and a desire to go above and beyond.", "Why should this situation be any different if OP were a woman? How are the standards different?", "It is a nice gesture - your hang-ups due to cultural upbringing are are not the other person's fault.", "You're confusing empathy with sympathy.\n\nYou have to experience it to have sympathy. Empathy is a mental exercise.", "This is bullshit", "It hurt so badly I was near tears through the entire class.  I knew the tailbone area was what seemed to be hurting so badly (even speculating to myself that it felt like my tailbone was being damaged by the floor), but everyone else in class was doing the same exact sit-ups that I was doing & they all seemed to be fine.  So I reasoned that it must just be my extreme hatred of exercise that was making me think I was in more pain than I was when in reality I was just being a baby.  \n\nHonestly, I still don\u2019t know why I was the only one this happened to.  I mean, you can start flat on your back & curl upwards into the sitting position in one way.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think most people\u2019s tailbones are shielded with any fat padding - nor would most people need a fat padding to shield their tailbone.  It\u2019s just sitting back there minding it\u2019s own business not bothering anyone for the majority of our lives.  Apparently mine is easily offended though or something though - I don\u2019t know.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That\u2019s a terrible experience but what an awesome guy.

I feel most people in Gen X are very different than Boomers+", "I'm 40 as well, no menopause either. I think the period shame is ingrained in our society unfortunately, but the fact that you recognize it as an issue and want your daughter to view it differently speaks volumes. She's very lucky to have a mom like you", "Exactly.  I\u2019m smh at all the responses saying \u201cthis is why men are scared to say anything\u201d etc.  That\u2019s disingenuous because it implies that men are incapable of what is essentially basic Human Resources 101.  You do NOT speculate on a corker\u2019s possible private physical condition for any reason (barring some possible life-threatening situation of course - which this wasn\u2019t).  OP did exactly that - without even specifically addressing the stain.  But now there\u2019s replies left & right saying \u201cmen just can\u2019t say anything\u201d or \u201cthis is why men don\u2019t say anything\u201d.  Men don\u2019t need anyone trying to add to their weaponized incompetence arsenal.

I said it's a lot like what you listen to, just different style of communicating the point. Love, drugs, heart break, frustration. Take brown eyed girl for example, he's into this stripper who is winking her \"brown eye\" at him. REALLY?! that's what that song is about? Yeah man. Totally. That was a long time ago when we were young smoking cigars on the beach at night. Thanks for the nice memory.", "Another woman wouldn\u2019t say \u201chey, you started your period.\u201d She\u2019d likely say she could see a stain and wanted to let her know.  \n\nContrary to popular belief, most women actually know if they\u2019ve started their period.", "OP doesn\u2019t actually know that the period surprised her though - if she was in fact on it, she may have bled through a tampon etc. That\u2019s why the wording and discretion matters.\n\nIt\u2019s not about being freaked out about it, or about periods being taboo. It\u2019s about tact.", "Pathetic tailbone aside, you\u2019re an absolute machine for just powering through that.", "Lol! I think her hang ups have nothing to do with her age and just the way she views things. I have a wide range of acquaintances (both in age and beliefs) and there are definitely some that would be mortified if they knew someone realized they were on their period. Just has to do with how you were raised/your social group and how they handle these things (or don't! )", "Just like that.", "He said he THINKS she started her period, not that its 100% that case\n\nWell I don't feel the need to jump around the word, its not like I would say it between other people to make fun of her, if its not period - ok then no big deal, if it is - I'd ask if she needs pad/tampon or offer something to cover up\n\nPf speak for yourself I had that happen to me when I had irregular periods because I thought it was discharge\nThankfully I was at home", "So... She got SURPRISED that it leaked, its still good that he pointed it out\n\nHe only said that he thinks she's on her period, that's still correct in that situation \n\nHe didn't do anything wrong, he was just being honest", "Again, it\u2019s not about doing something wrong, it\u2019s about displaying tact when alerting someone to an embarrassing situation.", "Well most people wouldn't mind that, he just so happened to say it to someone who didn't liked the wording and I feel bad for him"]}
