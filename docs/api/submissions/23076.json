But then again, I'm not ashamed of my periods or period accidents. But I know that some women would be mortified if this happened to them and to have it pointed out by a man would be even worse. As some other commenters have said, if you find yourself in this situation again, maybe just mention that they have a stain on their pants and then they can figure out the rest for themselves. Good luck with your manager tomorrow, I'm sure it's not going to be as bad as you think it's going to be.
