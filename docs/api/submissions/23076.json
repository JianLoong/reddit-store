Less embarrassing for her.", "NTA. Honestly unless your leaving something out you did a very good thing. She's probably embarrassed, that or taking this really wrong. No matter how badly this situation goes though don't let this event stop you doing the same with other women in the future. You did the right thing.", "NTA - If that is exactly how it went, I don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s upset about. I can understand being a bit embarrassed for anyone to point out something like that, but I would be embarrassed and grateful. \n\nPlease update after you talk to your manager.", "NTA, but I can think of two things: \n\n1) Did you make it clear you were talking about a stain on her pants? Is it possible she thought you were referencing her behavior or emotional state and being rude about it? \n\n2) Was the stain in a place where she might have felt you'd have to be looking at her inappropriately to actually see it?\n\nNeither of those things would change my answer, just spit balling what could have caused such a bad reaction supervisors need to get involved.", "Oh goodness! So sad that we still live in a world where the mention of period is taboo and can cause offence and shame! \n\nNTA OP, you were clearly looking out for her and your intentions were admirable. I\u2019d have been grateful to you for sparing me any more embarrassment. Just tell the story as it happened.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t make a big deal of it, pulled her to the side and told her quietly so nobody else could hear. Tbh she is the asshole.", "From my perspective, you're NTA and I'd be happy that someone pulled me aside and told me that I'd got my period. But then again, I'm not ashamed of my periods or period accidents. But I know that some women would be mortified if this happened to them and to have it pointed out by a man would be even worse. As some other commenters have said, if you find yourself in this situation again, maybe just mention that they have a stain on their pants and then they can figure out the rest for themselves. Good luck with your manager tomorrow, I'm sure it's not going to be as bad as you think it's going to be. Just say that you've reflected on the situation, realise you could've handled it better and it won't happen again etc. etc.", "NTA \n\nObviously you\u2019re not the AH your intentions were good but it\u2019s a lesson for the future to just pretend you didn\u2019t see anything, unless it\u2019s a friend or someone you\u2019re close to you run the risk of this happening", "She probably thought you were checking out her a$s and that's why you noticed. You sound like a nice dude so NTA", "NTA - It's an awkward situation, but most people would appreciate being told.  It's better to be embarrassed by one person than to run errands after work and then realize it was there the entire time.", "NTA. You were trying to be helpful, but now you're in a \"bloody\" mess.", "NTA. You genuinely tried to help, and there's nothing wrong with pointing out a potential issue to someone. She might have misinterpreted your intentions.", "NTA You were kind to offer your jacket. \n\nOthers might feel squeamish at the idea of possibly getting period blood on it, but your concern was for your coworker. \n\nI may have been embarrassed in her shoes, but I'd also be incredibly grateful.", "NTA. You had good intentions, you even offered to help her out. There\u2019s a good chance she knew it was there, and just hoped nobody noticed, but still, how could you have known?", "NTA- I would be thankful if someone told me that had happened instead of getting home and realizing after so many people had seen it, also would have been hurt that no one bothered to tell me. She might just be embarrassed it happened at all and that you pointed it out, so it sounds like she\u2019s framing it as though you must have been checking out her ass or being weird to have noticed it (which is not the case). There\u2019s a clear difference between a coworker blatantly staring at Tits when you talk to them vs. One pointing out there\u2019s a stain on your shirt by your breast. \n  \nIm sorry you  are in this situation when all you did was a nice thing for her. Write down everything that happened now and how you feel so tomorrow in the meeting if you\u2019re anxious it\u2019s easier to talk about, but I hope it\u2019s not a big thing and remember you did nothing wrong!", "Nta if that\u2019s all there was to the interaction. It seems like you were discreet and polite.", "NTA. If anything you'd be more of an asshole to see that and not mention anything. \n\nIf I had an embarrassing stain on my clothes I'd want someone to tell me.", "NTA.\n\nUnfortunately it sounds like colleague got embarrassed and might have conveyed a different interpretation of what happened.\n\nI would apologize to the colleague, get perhaps her take if you can ask directly, and tell your story to the boss as you told it here. \n\nIn the future while I think what you did is helpful and reasonable it might be best to say something like \u201cthere may be something on the back of your skirt\u201d or \u201cyou may have sat in something\u201d and leave it vague like that. It will genuinely help people unaware of the stain, but also be pretty bullet proof from an employer\u2019s perspective since it could be presumptive to claim it was period blood.\n\nNo reasonable person is going to punish you for politely and discretely mentioning there may be a visible stain.", "NTA. Her response is over the top.", "NTA. You don\u2019t seem to have bad intentions. Next time, just ignore it. Pretend you didn\u2019t see it.", "NTA- I think what happened was tunnel vision so to speak. After the word 'period' and 'stain' she probably just heard the rest as garble. I know I would just be so horrified it was at a public event and that probably went back to a bad memory. \n\n  \n\"People often dont remember what you said, people don't remember what you did, but they DO remember how you made them FEEL.\"\n\nMore than likely this was a case of displacement of feelings, and she just remembers feeling embarrassed and self-conscious = wrong interpretation of events.\n\n She may not even be 100% aware of it, as a lot of people do it. People remind them of a feeling, even if that feeling is inaccurate!   \n\n\nyou didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA. Intention and execution was flawless. I would definitely be super grateful if I were her. Hopefully your colleague comes around and retracts her complaint.", "NTA. Your intentions were good, you even kept it discreet; I'd rather be told than go out with a stain whatever the cause was. The only thing you could have done differently is pointing the presence of a stain instead of specifying that it maybe her period; although imo that's just nitpicking.", "Kind of NTA and YTA simultaneously. For letting her know about the stain, NTA. For presuming it was from her period, and talking to her about her period, when you don't really know her or even if it was indeed a blood stain, YTA. \n\nJust keep it vague. \"Oh, there's a spot there.\" Anything beyond that is reaching into creeper territory.", "NTA.", "Tell your boss exactly what you said here. Chances are she's trying to say that you were looking at her inappropriately to have noticed. Make sure he realizes that it was right there in front of you and she is way to old for you to have any interest. However, you do think it inappropriate that she would think of you thinking that and makes you wonder why she was thinking of you in that way. Tell him that's just gross! (Sometimes you have to turn the tables on someone who is trying to get you in trouble.)", "YTA. What were you trying to protect her from? You did the exact thing people would be trying to avoid. She would have discovered the issue at some point and you made it so she knew people had noticed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Could have phrased it differently with hindsight but really NTA and good on you for being kind.", "NTA. By discreetly telling your coworker about this condition, you gave her the chance to clean up before others noticed. It might have been wiser to say \"Hey, you have a stain on your pants\" and not speculate as to what might have caused the stain, but I'm not going to call you an ah.", "NTA. Phrasing could\u2019ve been better however one of my friends that I work with, she bled through her pants at work (we are teachers). I would\u2019ve died of embarrassment if I had been in her situation. We found a solution before any students noticed but god, I can\u2019t imagine what that would\u2019ve been like if it had gone unnoticed.", "NTA. I know that i would be grateful if someone pointed a stain out to me, i am not sure why she was upset or complained. its not like you made a big show of it or something. she was probobly just embarrassed, but you did everything right.", "NTA. Also, WTH. Please tell me every time if I have blood on my pants. (I'm in my 40s FYI). It's worse to get home and realize it's there and wonder why no one offered.  If it played out the way you say, she's looking to be angry at someone.", "I don\u2019t see why she would upset what was the story she told?", "NTA - she was probably mortified and this is her way of making sure she'd never have to see you again.  I get that you were trying to be helpful, but maybe next time just mention a stain, don't mention her period.", " NTA as long as it went down the way you say it did, i very much would have appreciated it!  Pls don\u2019t ket this one encounter stop you from helping others!!", "Shared as you presented,  you're NTA\n\nI would rather a man told me discreetly than to find it myself later and wonder how long it had been there without being told.", "NTA. \n\n You did nothing wrong or inappropriate, i think your coworker is being ungrateful and dishonest. She may have been embarrassed or offended by your comment, but that doesn't give her the right to lie about it or get you in trouble. \n\nShe is being immature and petty. You should explain your side of the story to your boss and hope he understands.", "Let's say the classic line: \"If OP was a woman, they would have gotten a different reaction\"", "From the offer of a jacket, I think it's pretty clear he was talking about a stain, not her emotional state.\n\nAlso most period stains end up visible in your peripheral vision if you're looking at someone, and unusual/unexpected colours draw the eye. It's very normal to see things in areas you wouldn't want to be staring at.", "Yes that was it verbatim I'm pretty sure. We were doing floors by the booths and I saw it, and I asked her to talk to me for a second by the register and said what I wrote above.", "Bruh... If there is a bloodstain at the back of your pants or inner thigh then it will be nothing but your period if you are a woman.. Oh and btw I am a woman too.", "I actually agree with this guy a lot", "Yeah I'm thinking I should have said that I think there might be a stain on her pants or something. But I'm pretty sure it was from her period because it dark red and in that area.", "I would expect anyone would notice she was obviously wearing light coloured trousers", "I mean yeah, but that's not really the point. OPs actions weirded her out enough that she went to their boss. Could've been easily avoided by some vagueness and tact. Not everyone would be upset about what OP did, but there are enough that would be that it makes sense to be careful.", "Yeah it\u2019s the most likely answer but could have been an early miscarriage or some other medical issue. \n\nJust tell the truth to your boss, you didn\u2019t say anything that could be classified as harassment or discrimination.", "That sounds like a her problem. If she wants to walk around with blood on her pants that's Gona attract attention to her then so be it but It's nothing to run and tell your boss about.", "Oh the miscarriage thing didn't even cross mg mind. Thanks."]}
