He is constantly complaining about my two kids and how they always do the bear minimum when it comes to chores. But never says anything to his son about his chore being done minimal. For example he was complaining to me about my daughter's (F13) clothes still being in a basket in her room but has said nothing to his son (M14) about the clothes that are all over his room and not even in a basket. He also complains my daughter is on her phone to much mean while his son is on the Xbox from the time he gets off school (he is in a video game club at school and stays after twice a week to play games but even on the days he don't stay he comes home and jumps on) until it is tome to shower which he has to be told to do. Mean while I work a full time job and deal with all the finances and he is a stay at home dad. I then come home and have to finish the dishes that are not done and sort through the laundry that he has washed that day and give the kids theirs then fold the towels and my own clothes. ( I refuse to put my husband's clothes away and they sit in a basket in our room). So I finally tell him \"look until you can tell your son to do all his stuff properly and make sure his stuff is done properly don't tell me my kids are lazy and don't do what they are supposed to do. Also until you as an adult can put your clothes away don't complain about my kids clothes. For me here is the real kicker. I tell my kids daily what chores they need to do and if they are not done they get grounded. I also tell my step son what chores he needs to do and when they are not done I try to ground him and then get told \"no I'll have a talk with him it will get done\" and it don't get done. This is an argument we regularly have and I always get yelled at and told to stop babying my kids.

Why is he not doing all chores, besides some for the kids? What does he do all day? The \u2018kids\u2019 are preteens-teens!!!!!

He definitely has a double standard when it comes to the children and I wonder what his behavior is like when you\u2019re not home. You probably need to sit down and have a talk with your children regarding his behavior and then you need to decide what you\u2019re going to do, but your priorities should be to protect your children", "NTA.

That's your choice. But your kids did not ask for this, you are inflicting this man on them and you're not around to see how he treats them when you are working all day.

Sorry, but he doesn't like your children, complains about them \"constantly\" and you're giving him unsupervised access to them.", "So he treats your kids as second class citizens.

He\u2019s not offering much else by the sounds of it. But what an expensive prostitute he turned out to be. You\u2019d be better single. Cheaper and less frustration.", "I'm puzzled. You have 13 and 14 year old preteens. How old is the third child?\n\nWhy do they need a SAHD?\n\nPut the children into babysitting training, then let them manage at home themselves.\n\nI did this with my own children. They took a St. John's Ambulance course after school for several weeks. \n\nI was not only reassured they would know be safe on their own, but it helped them earn babysitting money until they were allowed to work.\n\nLet Dad get a job. You have three kids to send through college or trades training, and retirement to save for.\n\nFor gosh sakes, are you going to work until you're 75-80 to support the dude?\n\nNTA\n\nBut you would be Y T A to yourself if you only complain and do not act to rebalance the inequity in your life and that of your children.", "N T A for what you said but you are definitely the AH for staying with a man that treats you kids like this.  \nIf you want to stay and be abused by him that\u2019s your choice but allowing him to also abuse your kids makes you an AH mom", "NTA but why are you letting this guy raise your kids?
