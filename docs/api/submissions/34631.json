{"id": 34631, "submission_id": "191xh8q", "title": "AITA for telling my mom I won't take care of her", "selftext": "My mom and I never had a good relationship. She got pregnant at 19 from my dad who she'd been seeing for a few months before. They only got married because I was on the way (as is the custom in Eastern Europe) and she made sure I knew that I was a \"love child\" (meaning not wanted) as she always joked about wishing she wiped me on the sheets instead or that she always wanted a boy, not a girl. Amongst other things she used to beat me on a regular basis, blame me for everything going wrong in her life, taking all my money as soon as I started working. We lived in poverty; we owed money to literally everyone I knew and it was usually either me or my brother going to ask for more as my mom was too embarrassed. Anyway, I got out of the village, moved as soon as I turned 18 and never looked back. \r  \nFast forward to last September. We were on the phone just chatting and the topic of her working without a contract came up. She said she's getting more money that way as she isn't forced to pay taxes on what she earns, but at the same time she's not accumulating any pension either. I've pointed it out that she's got about 15-20 years until retirement, if she makes it that far, and it would be a good idea to start saving for that, to which she said that she hopes she will get at least a bowl of soup from her children... I told her that it's probably not going to be so easy considering that she is not taking any care of herself. Smokes like a chimney (would rather buy cigarettes for herself than bus tickets for school back in the day), has Type2 diabetes for which she has meds prescribed but doesn't take them because she \"feels worse\" and continues to use sugar like it's nothing. Her side of the family is riddled with heart and circulatory diseases (from lifestyle choices mostly) so she knows what the consequences are, but says it is what it is and that if we won't take care of her ourselves we can put her in a home. Then I asked her (I think fairly) which one of us she thinks will be in the position to do that? My brother is a mommy's boy, he lives with her, never had a girlfriend, puts himself in debt and spends every penny he earns on her and the house they live in. I am trying to build a life for myself and am not even close to owning a garden shed, let alone a house. Am I supposed to leave everything and go home to take care of her for who knows how long or put myself in an even bigger debt so I can pay for everything from here. To which question she got so upset she started crying and hung up the phone. Later texted me to ask if I realise what I said and how much that hurts her because in our family it's not even a question that the children will take care of their parents, but honestly from the childhood I've had I'm lucky I made it out and the last thing I want to do is leave everything I worked for so I can go back to the same spot I started from, ESPECIALLY since she does nothing to prevent it.
