He is the literal definition of it and is married. He constantly makes comments to my wife that some of the residents are \u201csexy\u201d and wouldn\u2019t mind \u201cbanging\u201d them if the opportunity arises. He\u2019s cheated on his wife in the past but the wife forgave him. \nHe\u2019s been trying to befriend my wife and her friend for months now and I didn\u2019t care about that. She can have male friends that\u2019s not the problem. \nWell one day he texted my wife after work hours and his wife texted her saying \u201clet this be the last time you text my husband after work hours\u201d. My wife respect that and didn\u2019t text him. \nWell that was a while ago, this guy starts to text my wife again and she would just ignore him, unless he calls her then she answers.\nA week ago he called her at 9 at night, and starts spamming her phone. She stands up and goes to the room by herself to talk to him being secretive. \nI absolutely hated that. There\u2019s no reason that should be happening. What pissed me off even more so was that SHE went to hide in the room. I told her I wasn\u2019t okay with that bullshit. And asked her what was that about. She ignored the question. When i confronted her she just said okay, and when I told her to tell him that\u2019s not okay she was hesitant until I told her to tell him in a more serious voice. \nWell it was this Friday so she couldn\u2019t talk to him, come Monday though she completely ignored that request. \nShe casually brought up how he took her a snack and she was happy and that\u2019s when I realized she hadn\u2019t told him anything. She said she did but I know her and know enough about him that he would take it up the ass if she asked for a boundary. \nAm I really the asshole for wanting my wife to respect me and not be secretive with another dude known for cheating and fucking anything that has a vagina? She literally acted like that was her boyfriend and hiding her talk with him. \n\nI\u2019ve never in my life felt insecure but this really took the cake for me. It honestly feels like she\u2019s hiding something and it\u2019s eating me alive.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: thank you everyone for validating my feelings. My wife went to work today and let him know how it made me feel, how it was unprofessional and she will not allow that ever again. I found his wife\u2019s Instagram and let him know that if he does this again even after my wife told him not to, I\u2019ll send the proof to his wife. His wife is batshit crazy. When I say batshit crazy she wants him on the call all day to make sure he doesn\u2019t talk to any females, however work doesn\u2019t allow that. So she\u2019s constantly texting him and if she hears a story where a \u201cshe\u201d is involved it\u2019s an automatic argument. She has made his life hell after cheating on her and very well deserved. I made it crystal clear to him that if he does it again his relationship (or whatever you\u2019d want to call it at this point) will be done for because the wife will not accept it. I haven\u2019t sent the proof to his wife because my wife\u2019s job provides free housing for her and it pays pretty decently well. If this went to HR it\u2019ll cause unnecessary drama, and while I understand there might be cheating involved, I don\u2019t have definitive proof. She did what I asked her to do and I know this because I went to work with her this morning and I spoke to him man to man. He freaked out when I mentioned his wife being involved because his job also offers free housing and he\u2019s the only one who works plus has 3 kids. So in the end, while I may be pissed, it\u2019s not the kids fault if their dad loses their job. I couldn\u2019t care less about his relationship with his wife, as long as he stays away from mine. Plus I don\u2019t know this dude at all, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll retaliate against my wife one way or another. Oh and she deeply apologized to me saying \u201cit\u2019ll never happen again\u201d and that it was crossing the line. She understands I\u2019m extremely upset about it and takes full responsibility for it. I told her to block his number because there\u2019s no need for contact between them whatsoever. He\u2019s a maintenance guy while she takes payments for the apartment complex.
