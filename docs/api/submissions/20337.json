I mean I think I would still say he NTA and question if she would be comfortable if the roles were reversed but clearly it would be a whole different question if she is in mourning as opposed to he just moved on", "What are you on.

What's 'bad' in a relationship is what you mutually determined to be that. These two are learning what works for them and what doesn't. Bro saw something not meant for him/sis either got real sloppy or really needs to talk to her bf. At one level, expecting a partner to completely erase their past is stupid and egotistical.  At another level, as mentioned, these two seriously need to air out what's really happening here.", "Bunch of nonsense from the looks of it.
