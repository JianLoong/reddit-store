This subreddit has gone downhill quickly. You guys are downvoting the people saying YTA and saying he's NTA, but he ran away from him after he literally laughed in his face.

You left out any details of your relationship with him, but you went out of your way to let us know he still lives with his parents. You came here for validation and fed the subreddit the parts of the story that would bring you the validation you so badly sought. I also find it funny that your first thought after seeing his tattoo was automatically about loyalty in relationships when there's many other forms of loyalty. Like loyalty to your family. Of which you obviously have none. You obviously have some type of bad relationship and look for any way to bring him down, so he didn't want to be around you, and I don't blame him.
