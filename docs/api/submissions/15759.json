You have the right to expect her to provide the supplies she presumably already has.", "NTA - she shouldn't even have to be asked. Depending how often you babysit, she should keep you filled with supplies or bring them when she drops the kids off.", "NTA. You drop little kids at a babysitter's you leave all the things you mentioned. Just because she's your SIL doesn't make her special. Bring it across loud and clear.", "Info \u2014 Where is your brother, her partner, in all this?", "NTA. Let her know you can\u2019t provide these things and they\u2019re a necessity for the kids.", "NTA stop babysitting until she can provide for her own kids", "NTA. You shouldn't be expected to care for these children without what they need. Especially if you're not getting paid (you didn't indicate if you were) and you don't have those things handy because you also have kids that age (also don't know if that is the case).", "NTA- babysitting at this age means the parents brings a bag of tricks and even leaves some at your house. I'd bring a box of diapers over if my inlaws were going to have them more than 1x a month. Crazy", "NTA\n\nTell her you cannot look after the kids without these things being provided, and stick to it.", "NTA On the rare occasions I asked someone to watch my children when they were very young, I brought a packed diaper bag with clothes, food, wipes, diapers and snacks. Maybe your sister in law is clueless or I'm being a bit cynical but it seems like your sister in law is not providing what you need because of the expense and hoping you'll buy diapers, wipes, food etc. Either way, if you're giving your time to watch these children the very least she can do is show up with a fully packed diaper bag.", "I don't have my own kids nor do I have a job cause I have health issues.", "NTA - you're doing your SIL a favor, the least she can do is respect your time & resources by providing the bare minimum essentials.", "NTA - when you\u2019re a parent you\u2019re suppose to provide everything your child needs/will need when someone else is babysitting. If the kid has an allergic reaction to something you fed him/her your SIL will blame you. Better safe than sorry.", "NTA. As a mom myself I would NEVER expect anyone to spend their own money and food, clothes, diapers etc especially if you\u2019re watching them on a daily basis. \n\nMy parents only watch my child occasionally but they have made the decision to keep diapers, wipes and clothes just in case they ever needed extra. They also will feed my daughter the food they have in their home and have even bought snacks to keep there, even though I pack her diaper bag full of snacks. My daughter is the only grandchild though and is 1.5 years old so she doesn\u2019t require much anymore. When she was a baby I would always provide the bottles, formula, baby food if they watched her. \n\nI would just say something to her honestly.", "NTA - Of course you are not the asshole. You are being a wonderful person by watching multiple kids for free (I'm asusming).\n\nYou shouldn't then have to pay for supplies to watch her children.\n\nMaybe it's an inconvenience for her to always bring the stuff. Let her know that she can leave items at your place.\n\nIf there's a financial issue, that's not your burden to your bear. If you can help, that's great. If you cant, again that's not your issue.", "NTA  \n\n\nFile for child support at this point. I'm not joking. File for it.", "YWNBTA but I would phrase it in a kinder manner than that.

The only thing for the toddler she will send is shoes", "Not getting paid", "You\u2019re NTA of course. Maybe she\u2019s not bringing stuff over because that\u2019s her way of soliciting new items from you. Stop buying her and the kids anything outside of special occasions? You don\u2019t have to be their provider. Send her a list of what you need her to bring a day before she comes over next time. Does she even pay you to babysit?", "NTA. \n\nLet her know now that going forward, she MUST provide basic childcare supplies, or you will no longer be watching them. \n\nThen. \n\nYou need to meet her at the door when she next drops the kids off. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go through their bag and make sure you brought everything they\u2019ll need today.\u201d\n\nDo this before she gets the kids in the door.

But hold fast. She\u2019s not entitled to free childcare from you, and you absolutely can set the rules on what you are or are not willing to do.", "NTA\nIf it\u2019s gotten to the point of you buying things, the ultimatum should have been given before now.", "NTA. Why are you allowing her to drop the kids off without supplies? Each time she comes without clothes and other supplies, tell her you won't take the kids. Cut her off every time she tries it. Be very clear that you will only babysit if she brings the necessities with her.", "NTA- For telling her to bring stuff. Have you ever spoken to your brother about this before? And you are TA bc you should have told her after this happened the first time. So yes to the kids and yourself you are.", "NTA but your working uphill. You should have refused the minute she brought them with nothing. Start being firm and direct.", "NTA I think you should report her to child protective services.", "NTA. When I baby-sat for my cousins when their kids were babies, I\u2019d jokingly ask if they were moving in due to all of the necessities they brought.", "NTA, I bring everything needed when I do leave the kiddo with someone. It's not up to them, and if I forget something I pay them back", "NTA. I'd tell her she needs to keep a stock of those things at your house, since you can't trust her to bring them each time.", "Daycare providers expect basic needs to be provided, and you should too.

Stop doing this.", "Stop babysitting easy solution", "NTA tell her you won\u2019t watch them unless they come with all of their things! Food, clothes diapers! Babysitting shouldn\u2019t cost you money", "Nta", "I\u2019m not disagreeing that SIL is the A H, and you are NTA. But perhaps check on the Facebook free/giveaway pages or thrift sales. If they struggle that badly, it\u2019s an option.", "Next time she shows up tell her you cannot babysit unless she includes the essentials, then shut the door. She\u2019ll get the hint.", "NTA\n\nShe should be providing everything for them. You are not a daycare center. For perspective, my baby is watched by a relative for 6 hours, 2 days a week. I provided clothes, the pack-n-play, playmat, bouncer, clothes, diapers, and whatever other items she needs.", "I have expressed to her many times to bring clothes or bring formula or diapers sometimes she'll send money and I'll have to go into Walmart or somewhere to buy this stuff", "Why should OP coddle someone who is taking advantage of them?\n\nTelling someone that you won't watch their kids unless they have what they need provided to you is so far from an insult that I am genuinely unsure if you even know what an insult is", "Then why are you spending money on these kids and not getting it back from her?", "Does your brother know? Bc I've never walked out the house without a full bag and I have 3 kids. And my first 2 back to back and never went anywhere without their diaper bag ready to go and full. So either she's weaponizing incompetence so she can save whats at home. Or just a crap mom that doesnt care and is willing to just use you up in all ways she can. If your brother doesnt know I'd go over her head and let him know."]}
