I live 1 1/2 hrs from New York and my son wants to me come to where he is in NY on Mother's Day so we can visit and celebrate Mother's Day. He figured it wouldn't be a big deal for me to drive to him because he had to drive 5 hours to New York already and really didn't want to go out of his way to drive the extra distance to come see me. Call me old fashioned but I thought Mother's Day was a day where we go visit our Mothers and bring them flowers or gifts and spend time together - not the other way around. I don't care about the gifts or flowers - I just want to spend time with my son. Another issue is that I recently went through surgery and have been having health issues. I really don't feel up to driving to NY on a day when I should be able to relax and see my son but if I don't I won't be seeing him at all.  Am I missing something here? My son thinks I'm an asshole for not wanting to drive 3 hours round trip on Mother's Day. Am I the asshole for not wanting to drive so far on Mother's Day and expecting my son to come tome?\n\nEDIT: My Son is Single with no wife or kids.", "created_utc": 1683747245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13e0svy/aita_for_not_wanting_to_drive_3_hours_to_see_my/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Use this as the basis to communicate with him, rather than it\u2019s what he\u2019s supposed to do on Mothers Day, and you\u2019ll be more likely to get through. You don\u2019t want it to feel like an obligation, more like a gift.", "NTA\n\nAn errand is not a good gift, nor is an invitation a summons.  Stay home and relax.", "NTA, and WTF? Your son must be out of his mind if he wants you to drive for an event meant to celebrate YOU, and after a surgery at that, and calling you an AH if you do not feel up to it.", "I may get flack for this, but it's a Hallmark holiday. You have no more obligations than you would on Arbor day. Send a card (or he should send a card). NTA", "NTA - As much as you may want to see your son, you need to prioritize your health first. A 3 hour round-trip drive to the city is never just THREE hours on a normal day - but traffic on Mother's Day is going to be a mess. Be honest with your son and tell him that you will be happy to drive when you are fully recovered. Just make a plan to enjoy your day by yourself, i.e. download a movie, meal delivery, whatever sounds good to you! Yes, you will feel moments of loneliness, but try to remind yourself that May 14th is just another day on the calendar. (And most of all, try to avoid guilting him into visiting you)", "NTA\n\nYes it usually is family that travels to their mother, not the other way around", "NTA, given the surgery and the fact that your son is expecting you to travel rather than postponing, but y'all are adults and can definitely celebrate Mother's Day after your son is back from his trip.", "Either NAH or ESH. Depends on y'all's attitudes about this not happening.", "NAH. I can see why he doesn\u2019t want to drive more.

He drove that far, what\u2019s another hour and a half? That\u2019s what I would do, especially if I was single. \n\nAt the same time, this is always hard to judge. Sometimes there is a lot of hurt between parents and their kids, and there are reasons for the distance. \n\nSometimes parents put a lot of guilt on their kids and expect a certain amount of communication, but that in itself drives their kid away. Why chat if the first thing your parent says to you is something that makes you feel guilty? \n\nHow is a relationship with your parent enjoyed when they just make you feel bad?\n\nIn the very least, I would tell him to please call you on Mother\u2019s Day at a certain time. If he does that, then I would be happy with that.\n\nAlso - If you want to talk to your son more, it is perfectly okay to text him every couple of weeks and ask for him to call you on a certain day or time that works for both of you.\n\nSomething that drives me nuts is when parents NEVER make any effort at all to initiate contact. They give the excuse of \u201cI don\u2019t want to bother you\u201d.\n\nThis is only burdensome for the kid. It sets a precedent that the kid will only ever call if \u201cthey really care about you\u201d. This is just not true. Communication is a two way street. \n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to ask your kid to set up a time once every couple of weeks, or even once a month. Whatever they are willing to do.", "Damn, just an hour or two?! Op I'm so sorry that he can't be arsed, ig 5+ hours but an hour or two is nothing for a young single guy. He's just being lazy and a bad son. It is not your job to make the effort. I'd advise saving the effort and just staying at home. If he has an issue, tell him what you told us, that it's his job to make the effort not yours but also it's not that far and he's better suited to making the trip and whether he wants to see you or not depends on whether he makes that trip.", "NTA.", "Info: how often do you see your son? Do you ever go visit him where he lives? How old are you and he?\n\nEdit based on your response to ESH. Yeah, he probably should make the effort, especially since you just had surgery, but he is always the one that has to go to you. Plenty of people are older and in poor health and still manage to visit their loved ones. My grandfather had a stroke and was confined to a wheelchair for the last 20 years of his life and he still made the effort to travel to see his kids.", "NAH. Your reasons for not wanting to drive are valid. \n\nGiven the background that he's never invited you to his home, is in NY to see friends rather than to go a little further to be with you on Mother's Day, and is summoning you to NY rather than being willing to come to you, it seems you are an afterthought in your son's world. I am sure that hurts quite a lot. You're worth more than what he's willing to give.\n\nHappy Mother's Day in advance. I don't have one to visit or call, so I am sending those feelings to you instead. \u2764\ufe0f", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
