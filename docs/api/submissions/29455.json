I (23F) have a sister whose 33. We get along for the most part but after a huge argument I stopped paying for her hotel this week and she only has a few days until her check out. So what led to the argument was that she insulted my parenting and said Im a bad mom. We have two totally different experiences with motherhood. I had my first son at 15 and my second at 18. Their father and I split up when we were 18 and ever since we\u2019ve had an equal coparenting relationship.  \n\n\n We both have our own places and I keep the boys for three weeks and then he takes them for three weeks. Because of this, it allows us to be active parents and also live our lives like anyone else our age. During my three weeks I have the abiltity to go out of town, go on vacation, party and my ex does the same. Hes such an amazing father and we\u2019re flexible with the schedule if either of us wants more/less time. My sister on the other hand has no help. Her fiance left her while she was pregnant and shes been raising her three kids alone since. He doesnt see them or call, and only pays 80$ in child support a month.  \n\n\nMy sister struggles with childcare and ended up losing her apartment. Shes been in an extended stay hotel since August and Ive been paying since my parents cant afford it. They live in a studio themselves so they have no space for her and the kids. We live in a high cost of living city and if it wasnt for my boyfriend being willing to cover my section of the rent these past few months, I wouldnt be able to afford it. The other day my sister calls me and asks me if I can come over to watch her kids so she can go to a job interview. I went over to the hotel at noon and she left at 2. I had plans to go out with my boyfriend at 7 and let her know. She said she\u2019d be back soon but once it hit 6 I started calling her and she didn\u2019t answer\u2026  \n\n\nAt midnight she came stumbling in drunk and we got into a huge fight. I was pissed she made me miss my plans and she didnt have to lie about a job interview if she needed a babysitter to go get drunk. She started yelling at me saying that I dont even see my kids for half the year so to shut up about her needing a babysitter one night and that shes at home every single day with no breaks being a \u201creal mom\u201d while I go out living life like I have no responsibilities. And that Im a horrible mom because Im okay with being apart from my kids and she would never. I told her its not her choice to be around them 24/7, their father doesnt want them and its not my fault I choose a better man than she did. \n\nShe kicked me out and told the front desk to trespass me. I changed my card info so the next payment wouldnt go through the next day. My parents are calling me a HUGE asshole and threatening to cut me off if I stop paying for her room. That she never gets free time like I do so to understand she\u2019s jealous not being rude. They said to pay for another week and they\u2019ll pay me back after selling some things and I refused.

She lied about it, promised to be back at a time, and wasn't.  **She was the one that did the wrong here, not you.** \n\nWhen you tried to hold her accountable for her lies, s**he verbally attacked and abused you.**  \n\nWhen you pointed out the reality behind her false accusations at you, **she kicked you out.** \n\n*I changed my card info so the next payment wouldnt go through the next day.* \n\nGood for you.  **You were giving her a huge gift, basically your boyfriend was, because he was paying your rent so you could pay hers.  She wasn't grateful to you for this,** but went ahead and lied to you, blamed you for objecting to her using you, and acted like a jerk to you.\n\nIt's reasonable to stop helping such a person.  Frankly, if you had to get help financially to help her, **you can't afford to help her.  You should be building a savings account, for your own future and for your kids' future**, not subsidizing her.  \n\n*My parents are calling me a HUGE asshole and threatening to cut me off if I stop paying for her room.* \n\nWhy?  You have the same obligations she does, and need your money for your kids and your rent and yourself.  If your parents are going to demand you financially support your capable sister, there's something very wrong with how they think.  Why aren't **they** offering to babysit for her so she can get interviews?  **Why aren't they going after her like they are going after you to help her?  She's not more deserving than you**.  The two of you both have kids and your selves to support. \n\nIf they are willing to do this to you, let them.  This is very abusive behavior, for your parents to think they have a right to demand what you do with your money.  Your sister is capable and responsible for herself.  **You are not responsible for your sister's failings.**\n\n*That she never gets free time like I do so to understand she\u2019s jealous not being rude.* \n\nYou gave her a chance to look for a job to better her situation.  She lied about it, and went out to party instead.  She's not seriously looking to better her situation, only to use you.   That's a deep pit with no bottom.   There's a saying \"don't put yourself on fire to keep others warm.\"   That's what your sister wants from you, to give and give, whatever it does to you, to support her, while she takes advantage of you.  \n\n**If your parents want her to have free time, they can volunteer to babysit.  Volunteering you is wrong.**  Volunteering your money is wrong.  Manipulating and threatening you is abusive.\n\n*They said to pay for another week and they\u2019ll pay me back after selling some things and I refused.* \n\nGood.  Bank of you needs to stay closed.  I really wouldn't trust them to pay you back, not after their threat.\n\n*AITA?*\n\nNTA.  **You are doing what your parents won't do:  protecting yourself against your sister's abuse.**  If you have to block all of them for a while, to protect yourself from them making demands on you and wearing you down to compliance, block them.  **Abuse,** and this is, **negates all obligations.**", "NTA Even if you were the older sibling in this situation, it would not be your responsibility to pay for your sister's hotel. It wasn't ever your responsibility. Your parents should be doing that, if anyone. Also, your sister should have just told you she wanted a day out and planned one that worked around your schedule, but instead, she not only took advantage of you and lied, but insulted you to boot. And your parents are wrong, jealousy caused it, but she was still rude, still lied, and still took advantage of you. Good for you not putting up with that bs.", "NTA at all. I'm also a single mother. I would love to have the kind of situation you and your ex have. That's how it should be!", "NTA, you have been more than kind and your sister was way out of line.

She can be upset all she wants, but she's still responsible for her words and actions. She shouldn't have lied, she should have been honest, and she insulted you when you were upset with her childish antics. Sucks to suck, but if you already have minimal support, shitting on them isn't a good move.", "NTA if your sister chose to bite the hand that fed her and her kids that\u2019s her problem.

She lied, she insulted, she kicked you out/put up a trespass on you - she does not get to do all that to you and be a leech. Your parents can shut up - if they want to go nc over it, let them. She\u2019s not your problem or responsibility.", "NTA. Your sister needs to learn how to say \"I need some time for myself on X day for N amount of hours\" and let you decide if you can help her.

If your parents object that much, your sister and kids can move in with them.", "NTA- she should have been up front with her need for one night out and asked if you could cover her. Ywbta if you'd refused to sit because you had moral objections to her going out, but I don't think you would have done. \n\nMaking excuses after the fact after you'd been blowing up her phone worrying about her definitely makes her the ah, even before insulting your parenting", "NTA.\n\nYou have been doing her a big favor (paying her hotel) and you did her a small favor (watching the kids for job interview), and she repaid you by lying and insulting you. \n\nYou said your parents are calling you a \"HUGE asshole\", but you didn't mention whether your sister even apologized. If she hasn't apologized, then I think your parents are also AH for beating up on you instead of her. She should come back on her knees if she wants help, and your parents should tell her that if they want to help her. \n\nIt sounds like you have been doing pretty well. Please don't let your sister and parents drag you down.", "Nta. Your family sounds toxic. Your sister lied to get free child care. She took advantage of you and if you pay she will continue. I would go nc with your parents and sister.", "NTA. Sounds like you've helped your sister plenty without thanks.", "NTA and go full no contact with your family. The trash element is huge here. Not your job to rescue anyone and your whole sister and folks are total toxic trash. Tempted to say call CPS regarding your sister but the kids are not apparently in eminent danger.

If they're so rich why can't they afford to house and provide for their eldest daughter and insulting the one a decade younger for having her own life together?

Are you going to not be insulted and used as a bank or are you going to cave and be an atm they can insult and abuse?", "I didn\u2019t read past the part where she came stumbling in drunk. Anyone who is struggling financially should not be spending money on booze and partying", "NTA!! If shes so badly off financially, why is she going out spending money on alcohol. And she has no right to judge you just cause you have different parenting situations. Seeing your kids half the year is better than a lot of split up parents- my dad only took us from sat morn/afternoon to sunday night, barely two days, every OTHER week. She especially has no right to judge you and insult you while you\u2019re paying for the roof over her and her kids heads!! If she wants to be disrespectful and mean to the person helping her, then yeah, she can figure it out herself.", "Well, she truly fucked around and found out, didn't she? Drunk people are idiots.

Being a full time mother, especially single mother is hard and while some may say well she got herself into that situation, yes she did but no parent can anticipate how hard it actually is until you're neck deep. She should of been upfront and said she needed a night to herself to let her hair down and I'm sure you could of come to some sort of arrangement. \nPersonally I wouldn't of just stopped the payments purely for the children, I would of spoken to her the next day and gave her some notice of when she needed something else sorted by. If she's kicked out so are her kids and I'd hate the thought of them being potentially on the streets just because their mum acted stupid.

Just saying. If it\u2019s a frequent habit then, yes, alcoholic. But alcoholism is when they\u2019re dependent on it, they need it to get through the day. This genuinely sounds like she wanted a night out but just lied about it to OP. But again, we don\u2019t know if she\u2019s drinking every day. From OP\u2019s comments it doesn\u2019t sound like it. Realistically, for the situation she\u2019s in, she should\u2019ve gone out and went for a job interview and not a day out drinking but she could be depressed from the situation and wanted to take away some of the stress for the day? \n\nRegarding the parents, they can\u2019t expect OP to pay for the hotel when they\u2019re not paying it themselves. \n\nOP, it\u2019s not your responsibility. As sad as it is that your sister is homeless, she\u2019s not your responsibility. She\u2019s a grown woman and whilst it\u2019s lovely you want to help, there\u2019s only so much help you can offer before she starts to help herself. She either wants to help herself or she doesn\u2019t. From the sounds of it, she\u2019s not taking her situation seriously and isn\u2019t doing anything to help herself or her children.

She\u2019s their child after all. \n\nYou have every right to be upset and not pay your money to someone who\u2019s not being respectful to you. She may be blood but blood doesn\u2019t make family.

It's a bad situation and she does need help.", "Your parents are going to cut you off...from what, exactly? Their unreasonable verdicts on familial relationships? Because it's definitely not money they're gonna be keeping from you. NTA. Live your life. Your sister isn't just jealous of your setup.

Firstly, because as you said that you don\u2019t have the money to pay for both your portion of the rent and the hotel room.

She could easily have gone to a job interview and been outright rejected for a reason that threw her into dispair, and she self medicated because she probably has trouble accessing good mental health services.\n\nRemeber folks single moms struggle to find jobs because managers see them as a risk of not showing up, frequently running off early, and calling out because their kid is sick.

Set up an expected time she can get a job and start working on helping herself and her kids. You have enabled her this long and she might be trying but also knowing you had her back. Cutting her off just like that will only hurt her kids. Let her know she can\u2019t lie to you either. Obviously she felt the need to lie because she didn\u2019t think you would have babysat. Probably because she wanted to get drunk and you paying her \u201crent\u201d she felt she couldn\u2019t be honest. Never let a drunk person get to you. They are drunk.

Your anger is valid and you should not pay for her but you can pay for a week and let your parents repay you.

I (23F) have a sister whose 33. We get along for the most part but after a huge argument I stopped paying for her hotel this week and she only has a few days until her check out. So what led to the argument was that she insulted my parenting and said Im a bad mom. We have two totally different experiences with motherhood. I had my first son at 15 and my second at 18. Their father and I split up when we were 18 and ever since we\u2019ve had an equal coparenting relationship.  \n We both have our own places and I keep the boys for three weeks and then he takes them for three weeks. Because of this, it allows us to be active parents and also live our lives like anyone else our age. During my three weeks I have the abiltity to go out of town, go on vacation, party and my ex does the same. Hes such an amazing father and we\u2019re flexible with the schedule if either of us wants more/less time. My sister on the other hand has no help. Her fiance left her while she was pregnant and shes been raising her three kids alone since. He doesnt see them or call, and only pays 80$ in child support a month.  \nMy sister struggles with childcare and ended up losing her apartment. Shes been in an extended stay hotel since August and Ive been paying since my parents cant afford it. They live in a studio themselves so they have no space for her and the kids. We live in a high cost of living city and if it wasnt for my boyfriend being willing to cover my section of the rent these past few months, I wouldnt be able to afford it. The other day my sister calls me and asks me if I can come over to watch her kids so she can go to a job interview. I went over to the hotel at noon and she left at 2. I had plans to go out with my boyfriend at 7 and let her know. She said she\u2019d be back soon but once it hit 6 I started calling her and she didn\u2019t answer\u2026  \nAt midnight she came stumbling in drunk and we got into a huge fight. I was pissed she made me miss my plans and she didnt have to lie about a job interview if she needed a babysitter to go get drunk. She started yelling at me saying that I dont even see my kids for half the year so to shut up about her needing a babysitter one night and that shes at home every single day with no breaks being a \u201creal mom\u201d while I go out living life like I have no responsibilities. And that Im a horrible mom because Im okay with being apart from my kids and she would never. I told her its not her choice to be around them 24/7, their father doesnt want them and its not my fault I choose a better man than she did. She kicked me out and told the front desk to trespass me. I changed my card info so the next payment wouldnt go through the next day. My parents are calling me a HUGE asshole and threatening to cut me off if I stop paying for her room. That she never gets free time like I do so to understand she\u2019s jealous not being rude. They said to pay for another week and they\u2019ll pay me back after selling some things and I refused.
