No employee, let alone sister should ever treat you that way. The only thing you did was said you were uncomfortable with they way she was speaking with you and that\u2019s more than a valid reason to complain. I\u2019m no lawyer, but I think that\u2019s verbal abuse in the work place, hope things calm down for you", "NTA. Your sister sounds pretty unhinged. Doubting that's out of left field, so why in the world did you recommend her to your company?", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is an abusive AH. So is your mom. But you knew that already. Sister and mom are making you doubt yourself unnecessarily. Stop taking what they say at face value.\n\nBare minimum, your sister has demonstrated classic DARVO behavior - deny, accuse, reverse victim and offender. She's the AH, but she's blaming you for the consequences of her own actions.\n\nYour mom is taking your sister's side and blaming you. That's nonsense. Your sister is responsible for her actions, not you. She harassed you at work. She quit her job. You did not do either of those things. Your sister and mom are the AHs here.", "Your sister was violating your work/life balance by arguing about home issues at work, and work issues at home.  You brought up a very valid point to upper management, and they presented a proper solution, have you not work directly under one another.  This is not only understandable, but a common practice when family members work for the same company; it's actually surprising she was ever in a position directly above you to begin with.\n\nIt was HER choice to not accept that location change.  She was not forced to quit.  And the company's condition of a covid vaccine is 100% valid, as many companies, especially those in the medical field, require the vaccine to protect everyone involved.\n\nNTA, but your sister is a serious AH who let power get to her head, and is now punishing you for bringing up the concerns in the absolutely correct way.  You gave her many chances, talking to her about it directly, before bringing it up to management.  She f\\*ed around and found out.\n\nEDIT: I forgot about the slander and lies she's started slinging now.  Be sure to keep careful track of what she's saying, and who she's saying it to.  If she takes it too far and someone takes action against you, you're going to want as much proof as you can get your hands on.  And don't be afraid to talk to a lawyer if it gets too far.", "NTA, \n\nYour sister seems absolutely crazy tbh. If she pulls these kinds of stunts often i would consider going NC. I don't know about your mother but I'd explain the situation clear maybe one or two times and state cleanly that she quit herself after getting a promotion that included a vaccination but that her quiting has nothing to do with you and everything with her not accepting that position.\n\nGood luck, seems like you have a tough family", "NTA.\n\nYour sister needs to learn how to take accountability for her own mistakes and wrongdoings, and harassing you AND your family, including a child, just reinforces that she\u2018s a massive AH.\n\nShe fucked around and found out. She doesn\u2019t get to blame you for her toxicity and immaturity.", "So you reported harassment to your management and they gave pay raise to the person who was harassing you? What's wrong with them?\nNTA, your mother and your sister are both though. Especially for complaining to your 8 year old daughter! What's wrong with your mother?", "Absolute NTA\n\nFucking hell she's 30 and goes on like that? What an absolute child.\n\nIt's a real shame your mother is on her side, I'm assuming you've told your version of the events.", "INFO Has your sister had trouble with jobs in the past? I just don\u2019t see this as new behavior for someone her age. NTA of course, but it sounds like she is harassing you and your family.", "Omg NTA she got herself fired for refusing a vaccine. \n\nYour complaint even gave her a pay raise! Lol she should have thanked you for complaining.\n\nYour family sucks. Block her number on your 8 year olds phone kids don't need this drama.", "NTA her behavior was out of line and you responded in the correct way. Also not your fault she refuses to get the vaccine, that's entirely on her, well actually this is all on her", "Wow, that b\\*\\*\\*h is on some powertrip! NTA, and you should go to the police and report harassment and get a restraining order. She is totally out of whack! Do not accept it, do not just let it happen, you have to keep fighting back.", "Your sister is very good at being the victim in her stories. For some reason your mom is her biggest fan.

This reflects poorly on you at work as you can see now.", "NTA\n\nShe was irresponsible and immature dragging personal issues into work.

Pretty toxic family environment the way your Mom reacted.  And that\u2019s why helping family get a job is dangerous.", "NTA, you need to go NC with your sister and your mother and possibly file a police report. Or at least give her an ultimate warning that you'll do so should she make one more move. Tell your mother to be happy with her golden child, you're out of it.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is freaking UNHINGED", "NTA. Your sister sounds terrible. Is she having some kind of psycotic episode? Those reactions are not normal, right from scolding her sister on company time to her latest shenanigans. You don't call the authorities about people's children just to get back at them for whatever reason. That is sick. Besides, you didn't get her fired. The fact that she is an antivaxxer is on her entirely. She must bear the consequences.", "NTA. She quit a higher paying position over a shot, you didn't get her fired. She sounds like she has serious mental health issues and I'm sorry you are still having to deal with her harassment. Hopefully work is at least as safer environment now.", "NTA - Go NC. With all of them if you have to. Your family are her enablers. They want you to apologize so she\u2019ll calm tf down.  \n\nBut it\u2019s not your responsibility, it\u2019s hers.

Even with suggestions on what kind of notebook to use for documenting things.\n\nAlso I hate to say this.....but cut off your parents. They cannot have contact with you or your kids. Grandparent rights are still in a lot of states and they are terrifying at times. Like NY has some of the worst ones.

I am in Illinois so I am unsure of the grandparents rights here, but I have cut them off entirely. I will also check out the page you recommended. I appreciate it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister claimed medical neglect on my children to CPS with claims that I do not have adequate food for my 9 month old son and he is losing weight, he is on the smaller side yes, but I have seen an IBCLC and a nutrition specialist per the referral from our doctor because he was on the slow end of his growth chart, but the only time he lost weight was when he had RSV and was in the hospital on oxygen for 3 days. \n\nShe also claimed medical neglect on my 8 year old because she occasionally pees the bed to which I asked friends and family on Facebook (she tried claiming I publicly shamed my daughter her for this in her complaint to CPS) about and they suggested having her go potty before bed and we have not had any issues since, unless she forgot to go potty, which is typically when we are on vacation and we aren't following our usual routine. \n\nAs well, she is claiming I refuse to give my 4 year old medication for her febrile seizures and refuse to give her medical when her fever spikes up. Which again, I have medical documentation stating I even took my 4 year old to the ER twice in one day because her Tylenol and Motrin weren't keeping her fevers down (she had RSV as well) and her febrile seizures, she hasn't had one since she was 1.5 years old. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have all the medical documentation for all of her claims and the caseworker said she will file it as a false claim so once it is unfounded then I can get the paperwork and document that as well.", "well and every other job may have given her a decent recommendation as part of her leaving agreement? and no one else complained about sister? \n\nthey may have felt this was an issue between siblings that could be resolved by just moving Sister. they had a better paying position for her elsewhere. it would make sense.", "Yup time to get your ducks in a row.\n\nOnly extra thing I'll suggest is if ANYONE comes to you in even slight defense of your sister to either cut contract OR go on a info diet. Which means they are only told need to know stuff. That's it. Everything is basic answers \"kids are great. We're great.\" Etc. Don't give them any extra information that is about y'all's lives.\n\nAnd if you've got a case worker/social worker is invite them into the house to do a check willingly don't wait for them to schedule it. Tell em come right in and check what you want we've nothing to hide. I'd also add a small kids library if you've room. Just normal books in their age levels. I highly suggest magic tree house, Nancy drew and Hardy boys. And the babysitters club. All classics and easy to find. Plus baby level books, some teething rings etc. \n\nI know it's a waste of paper but every time you go to an appointment Id get a summary of visit packet. I hated them myself but if it holds details on appointments/future visits it could help as well.\n\nOh! Talk to the schools!!!! Daycares/schools and remove EVERYONE except you, DH and a trusted friend off the pick up lists! Tell the schools what's going on and that No one absolutely NO ONE unless they've been cleared by you and DH are to pick the kids up. Password protect everything, schools, doctors, everything.\n\nAnd look into it's called \"the family password\" for the 9yr old and younger ones as they get older. It's a special word that NO one would know except those told and they can use it if someone tries to pick them up that they aren't expecting.\n\nLike it could be \"sunshine\" or \"dolphin\" something wacky no one else would guess but easy for them to remember. You remind them that they tell absolutely no one the password and they can demand absolutely anyone who tries to pick them up to give the password and if they don't? Make the biggest fuss they ever have, the hugest tantrum they can muster and make a scene.  Because unless it's mommy or daddy they won't go with anyone unless they got the password. Because if they got the password it means mommy and daddy trusts them and then kiddo can too. \n\nAnd giving a kid permission to cause a scene makes it less scary if they have to because they know they won't be in trouble  so more likely to do it.\n\nIt helps with stranger danger to and can be a bonus in your case. Because a judge likey will wanna talk to the older ones and they can proudly talk about how they know what to do with stranger danger and how their family has a special word to keep everyone safe etc \n\nYou got this.

It used to be done years ago but it's made a comeback full force.\n\nI'd talk to the ex dh and see if he wouldn't mind the extra visitation time instead. I'm sure he'll say yes and it'll help the oldest transition in all of this as well. \n\nAnd sorry last thing (gotta love ADHD) I'd maybe look into a children's therapist for the older ones esp the one being targeted and harassed by grown adults.
