Both parents live 3 hours from each other. We\u2019ve lived here for many years, and our routine has typically been to visit in the summer and the holidays. Obviously, we are at the mercy of work and school.\n\nMy family are more homebodies, they don\u2019t travel much and are usually pretty flexible. My in-laws travel a lot, and have a bad habit of making plans to see our kids before we\u2019ve made any decisions. \n\nLast year at Christmas, we couldn\u2019t go because my spouse did not have the vacation. We decided to invite my in-laws up for Christmas. I made plans to have a Christmas dinner and for us to do things around town. Instead, they rented a house in the city, took our kids and kept them the whole week. The food I had went bad, I wasted money on tickets, and I was angry that I didn\u2019t have my kids for Christmas. \n\nNow to this Christmas. My father needs spinal surgery, and we thought that was going to happen in October, but the surgeon had an accident. So, it was up in the air when he would have surgery. So, we were tentatively discussing the idea of staying home for Christmas this year if my parents couldn\u2019t do it. My kids only have 1 week off from school, as well. \n\nWithout asking, my in-laws rented a house up here the week after Christmas. \n\nWell, I talked to my parents this past week and surgery for sure will be after the new year. So, in an effort to include everyone for the short amount of time we have, I suggested we see our family before Christmas and then come back home to spend the rest of Christmas in the house they rented here. I even discussed it with my MIL and seemed excited for the idea. I thought we were set and I told my family.\n\nWell, my in-laws called my spouse a week later and said that if we were visiting my parents, we should visit them at their house, too. That they only rented the house in case we couldn\u2019t make it. \n\nI got angry and told them that we weren\u2019t changing plans. They decided that they weren\u2019t coming to see us and canceled their reservation. They are very clearly angry at me and texted to say they weren\u2019t doing gift exchange. \n\nI know that this has hurt my spouse\u2019s feelings tremendously. But I\u2019m tired of their parents yanking us around every summer vacation and Christmas. But I\u2019m not sure this was the right place to take a stand. \n\nDoes this make me the asshole?\n\n\nEdit: \n\n1. I have never kept my kids from either set of grandparents. In fact, both sets gets both kids over the summer without us. They have for over a decade. This isn\u2019t about keeping the kids from them. It\u2019s about logistics and money and the fact that they make plans without telling us. \n\n2. Last Christmas I discussed all of our plans with my MIL. I discussed Christmas dinner, I discussed going to see some places, everything when I invited them. Without telling me, they rented a house in the middle of the city and made their own plans.\n\n3. Yes, communication is bad because they agree with me to my face and then call later and contradict everything. They do this to my spouse, as well.

(Major Y T A to your spouse and in-laws though.)\n\nYou should never have allowed your in-laws to take your kids for Christmas week. They were out of line to think that was okay (so was your spouse). I can't imagine not spending Christmas with my kid when it's not a divorced/co-parenting situation. \n\nYou're well overdue to set some strong boundaries with your spouse and in-laws. They cannot make plans for you and your kids without your consent and without checking with you first. Plus, you're not going to your parents' this time for a normal visit. Your dad is having surgery and you need to be there. You don't need to be driving all around to see them too.\n\n\n>Yes, communication is bad because they agree with me to my face and then call later and contradict everything. They do this to my spouse, as well.\n\nThis only works if you let it. If you communicate plans and they agree, stick to your plans. Like last year, if they rented a house I would have said, \"Great. We (meaning you two *and your kids*) will be at home this week as discussed and we'll be doing all the meals and activities we agreed upon. We hope to see you for anything you can attend.\" \n\n[Not trying to be harsh in my comments - I'm just really annoyed for you.]", "Info: how were they able to take your kids for a week, without your permission?\n\nEdit: It sounds like you have a spouse problem, not an in-law problem. You two need to get on the same page. It\u2019s not okay for anyone to take your children for a \u201cnight\u201d and keep them for a *week.* YTA to yourself and your kids.", "NTA, no.  They seem entitled and expect everything to happen on their plans.\n\n\"...took our kids and kept them the whole week...I was angry that I didn\u2019t have my kids for Christmas.\"\n\nNever let that happen again.  YOU and your spouse are the parents. not them.", "NTA. I have in-laws like that too. They also think they can fly over and book a house on a whim and except all our plans to rearrange to accommodate theirs last minute. \n\nSo this year we aren\u2019t budging and will only see them during one or two days that suit us. It took a lot of frustration to get on the same page with my SO, which is \u201cour family and plans first, everyone else second\u201d. \n\nUnfortunately if your SO doesn\u2019t have your back, you need to go for plan B - which is where you take your kids on a holiday or to see your own parents for the holidays and he can entertain his own if he chooses.\n\nThis is your family. Your holidays. Your milestones and YOUR CHILDREN. You don\u2019t owe anybody any of it.", "NTA.\n\nI am dumbfounded at the gall of your in-laws. They **stole your children** for an entire week? I can't even image allowing that. Why did you let them walk out the door? Did they sneak in at night or pick them up at school? Why didn't you go bring them home? Did they lock them up? Did you call the police? I can't even comprehend this.\n\nYou need to set some serious boundaries with these people. Not being bullied because they make and change plans without even consulting you is just the start. \n\nJust to be clear, you did not \"choose not to see them.\" They chose not to see you! They made plans without even consulting you. You accepted those plans. And then they changed those plans again without consulting you, and you decided to stick with their initial plan.\n\nYou have done nothing wrong except not having a spine. You need to grow one. Spending a Christmas with no contact is a perfect start to your new, boundary-setting life.", "You have a husband problem", "NTA. Go to your parents. Let your husband go to his families if he wants to but make sure they all know you won't be changing your plans.", ">They are very clearly angry at me and texted to say they weren\u2019t doing gift exchange.\n\nI'm sorry,  but this is hilariously petty on their part. \"You're not available for our personal convenience? No gifts for you!\" Oh no! What will you, an adult with your own money, doooooooo on Christmas?\n\nYour inlaws are inconsiderate bordering on disrespectful. Keep on keeping on. Either your inlaws will learn to be more respectful of your time and to conduct themselves with honesty, or you'll get a lot of time and money back from these oafs. **NTA**.\n\np.s. Make sure your spouse isn't enabling their parents. They sound like they introduced a lot of the problems by consistently prioritizing their parents' wants, and that shit needs to stop.", "NTA\n\nYour in-laws are definitely on Santa's naughty list this year. \nThey need to grow up and learn to communicate and coordinate. \nBut more importantly, they need to learn to respect boundaries.\n\nFrom what you've mentioned, their focus is to spend time with their grandkids. They're not interested in you or your plans.\n\nY'all are the parents. Take charge and put them in their place.\nI feel sorry for your spouse to have such controlling parents. \n\nBut this is a pattern of behaviour that you must break before it breaks your family.", "NTA. But you and your spouse need to set very explicit boundaries with your in-laws in future. You can frame it as a family policy that should be in place to avoid the 'miscommunication' that happened this Christmas.", "NTA. You need to get some marriage counseling. It is OK to exclude problematic people and situation from your life, but you and your wife need to come to agreement. I suspect there are larger issues here, and Xmas is only symbolic.", "ESH. You for making plans for them and not talking to them, and them for taking your kids and making plans without asking you as well. Also them for using gifts as a punishment. How childish. Y'all need to learn better, solid communication skills.", "*\"I made plans to have a Christmas dinner and for us to do things around town. Instead, they rented a house in the city, took our kids and kept them the whole week.\"*\n\nYTA - Sounds like you do not know how to communicate effectively if the aforementioned thing actually occurred.  Also getting angry at family trying to spend time with you is kinda lame just communicate better and set boundaries without pissing everyone off.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Between your spouse and your in-laws, it sounds like the only thing you can do right now is maintain your boundaries and hold your ground. You are not obligated to go along with whatever they want and they are not entitled to access to your children when and however they feel like it. But seriously, you need to have a serious and unflinching discussion with your spouse about this because you should not be the only one dealing with this, the two of you need to be a united front. Also, I think the language is important here. You didn't \"make the decision not to see them\", they tried to change the plans after they were already made and you simply didn't let them so they threw a tantrum.", "If someone kidnapped my children - on Christmas no less - I\u2019d be laying charges against them, never mind worrying about their future Xmas.

The in-laws were in town with OP's kids and he didn't go into town to see them on Christmas?? Was OP just sitting at home pouting while his kids did Christmas with the in-laws? Based on the situation at hand I'd say N T A but in this context ESH.", "I thought the same when I read that. But then I read further: When OP made plans this year, the In-Laws backpedaled behind OP's back. This is giving me the impression that the In Laws just seem to be self serving and controlling and (maybe) using their kid to get away with it. \nIt's alright to want to spend time with family. But OP tried to be reasonable but the In-Law are just trying to manipulate their way around.", "Yeah OP sounds like y'all need to communicate better, and set better boundaries.\n\nESH", "Likely..  but you need to remain calm and communicate with your spouse in order to win this battle.  Getting angry boosts the idiots to think they are in the right and you are unhinged.\n\nThat being said..  how the hell as a man do you let someone else have your children on xmas morning.  That's why I think hes an asshole.  Should have put his foot down when that suggestion was even mentioned.  I would be god damned before my son spent xmas morning with grandparents instead of my wife or I (or one of us if we were separated)"]}
