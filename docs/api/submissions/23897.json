It was a beautiful ceremony and the reception was a lot of fun for everyone, I think.\n\nThe only thing that could have messed it up was my brother. He wanted to ask his girlfriend, Sara (27) to marry him at the reception during his speech welcoming my husband to the family. My dad passed away last year and I thought it would be good to have my brother do the honors. Thank God he told me his idea beforehand.\n\nMy brother didn't know that Sara, who is one of my best friends, had already told me that she was pregnant. My brother is a youth pastor at our church. Sara is the choir director. Everyone looks up to them. I told him that if he had the audacity to try and include himself in my day the response to his speech would be me toasting his new baby. He was furious that I knew about it. And that I would leverage it against him. I saw red. I said that if he and his girlfriend were willing to go against our beliefs then I had no problem calling him out. Our fight got loud enough that our mom came in to break it up. I kept my mouth shut despite wanting to blab right there and then. \n\nLike I said my wedding went perfectly. And my brother proposed to his girlfriend privately at a beautiful little spot in the hotel grounds after we left the reception. Sara thanked me for my discretion and for convincing my dumbass brother not to try and horn in on my day when I got back from my honeymoon. We all had dinner with my mom last night and my brother is still salty about the situation though. When I spoke with him to congratulate him on his engagement he said I was petty to keep him and Sara from having a moment in the sun. I said that there were a thousand more appropriate places for him to propose and that he chose well.", "created_utc": 1691201797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ij7yt/aita_for_blackmailing_my_brother_into_not/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, seems like you have a solid future SIL", "NTA, god I hate people that try to propose at other people's weddings. The only time that is okay is if it was planned in advance and both bride and groom are fully on board and enthusiastic about sharing their day. Otherwise, do your thing on your own time and don't take away someone else's spotlight. There are 364 other days, you don't need to propose at someone else's wedding. I'm glad Sara agreed with you and thanked you for holding your ground", "NTA Unless you have approval from the bride and groom, absolutely do NOT propose to someone at another person's wedding.", "NTA\n\nI don't get the whole 'proposal at a wedding' thing, like why would anyone want to make someone else's wedding about themselves? wait for your turn, dude", "NTA. Your brother needs to get over it and I'm sure his fiancee agrees.", "ESH. He shouldn't have tried to propose at your wedding. But omg it's incredible that rather than expressing concern that he has so violated your \"principles\" and engaging him soberly on the issue, you blithely proposed to blackmail him over it. You are all that's wrong and false-faced about religion in a nutshell.", "NTA. You never take the spotlight away from the couple on their wedding. The fact that you had to hold this over him for him not to do it, instead of him just respecting your wishes, is telling of his character.", "NTA although you should have perhaps tried softer methods first. \n\nOn the pregnancy note, unless they get married within 1 month or so, won't it be very obvious that they did something against their church positions anyway?", "NTA he don\u2019t want \u2018a\u2019 moment in the sun, he wanted  \u2018your\u2019 moment in the sun.", "Let\u2019s see\u2026.he proposed on this day, figuring it\u2019ll be a quick engagement and fast marriage\u2026\n\nHmmm: 9 months - x days/conception date= someone will figure it out", "NTA.

He'll get his when he gets married. NTA", "Blackmail? Really? The far more mature thing would be to uninvite him. I can guarantee from personal experience that this is almost certainly going to destroy your relationship with your brother. Especially since from your account you jumped straight into blackmail as opposed to talking like an adult. I'd be very surprised if your brother ever speaks to you again, and I don't blame him.
