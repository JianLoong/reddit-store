My dad passed away last year and I thought it would be good to have my brother do the honors. Thank God he told me his idea beforehand.\n\nMy brother didn't know that Sara, who is one of my best friends, had already told me that she was pregnant. My brother is a youth pastor at our church. Sara is the choir director. Everyone looks up to them. I told him that if he had the audacity to try and include himself in my day the response to his speech would be me toasting his new baby. He was furious that I knew about it. And that I would leverage it against him. I saw red. I said that if he and his girlfriend were willing to go against our beliefs then I had no problem calling him out. Our fight got loud enough that our mom came in to break it up. I kept my mouth shut despite wanting to blab right there and then. \n\nLike I said my wedding went perfectly.
