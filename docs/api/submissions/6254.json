I have older sister (13 years older) who would often kiss me on forehead or cheeks and be very loving at times. All in all it was brotherly love, no incest. When I became adult, I strictly set boundaries and told her that it doesnt make me feel comfortable and she respected it. If your husband cant set a boundaries to his incestous sister, he is a garbage husband and you deserve better than this abuse. Also him threatening to divorce you should be the main signal for you to reconsider your position and if its worth it to be his wife, let alone have his children.", "Regardless of the exact definition, shit is definitely weird and I\u2019d be very uncomfortable", "Absolutely it's eww.", "I Can barely tolerate high fiving my bro wtf", "Same.

He does treat his sisters like gold compared to me that\u2019s for sure.", "So she has daddy issues as well as incestuous tendencies. What the actual fuck?", "Wow, just Wow!!!!  This makes this behavior so much worse.  Ahh yeah.", "That only makes it worse!", "Oh I think that's pretty much guaranteed at this point", "Maybe it only makes him uncomfortable when she does it in front of you.

You wouldn't be okay if this was a friend, or ex lover. Why do you have to put up with this from a sibling? So weird.", "Sounds like your husband has some issues. I'm not going to speculate but that sounds like there's some history in some shape or another.", "I'll ask you, if this was being done by another woman that is not his sister, would you consider it cheating?

But it sounds like he may not even want to (not saying that he's into incest, but that he's fine with his sis being that way, as you said, he see is at \"endearing\") AND that he's also disrespecting your very real thoughts and feelings on this.

I\u2019m rooting for you.", "Give us an update please!", "Yeah if it were another women doing this it\u2019d be borderline cheating.
