We live I. West Coast USA where we have to drive up get anywhere. She doesn't drive here do she's dependent on us. I try to accommodate her and ask her to go with me 90% of places. We take her out and even asked her if she wanted us to drop her off somewhere and pick up later (which she took as we are trying to tell her to leave the house for a few hours). I really try to be nice. But she's staying for a month and Half and I am not perfect. \n\nSo today: I have a brother who lives near by and my sister was passing by. We went out to breakfast and I took my son with me. My husband was taking a nap since our son (1 year old) is having sleeping issues and we are exhausted to say the least. Also I got my period this morning and I have bad PMS. I work, take care of my son, breastfeed and try to have some fun. Life is hard. \n\nWhen I came home my husband told me my MIL is triggered that I left with my son without telling her exactly where I was going, when I was coming back...she claims that since she doesn't have a car it's not good to just leave. Also she wasn't sure if I was going to make lunch. I tried to explain to her that I'll be out for a few hours at my brother's, but we don't speak the same language but I try to learn and do speak a bit. My husband is just napping upstairs and will be awake less than an hour after I leave. \n\nThen she said she is triggered with my entire character. That I get mad at my parents ( non of her business, I have a very turbulent relationship and it's something I am struggling with and I don't need judgement) . Also I got mad at my husband a few times (how dare I get angry at her son right?). I have mood swings. I think she is not happy that I'm not more submissive, which I'm really not. Il also add that I'm middle Eastern origin and she's very xenophobic from a.small European village. Frankly I broke down when he told me because I don't need another older women who constantly judges my mothering, judge my personality. \n\nI'm so tired and I am struggling as a new mother, no support what so ever and no money for child care. \n\nMy husband wants me to apologize to her for leaving with little explanation. I don't want to.

You are a grown up and you don\u2019t have to tell her your whereabouts. Tell your husband to put her in her place or you\u2019ll do it. You are not her babysitter and you will not allow her to judge you in your home. You may have a language/culture barrier, but that doesn\u2019t mean you cow down to her. She needs to know she isn\u2019t leading your house hold, you and your husband are.  Tell hubby to be supportive of you in dealing with her.", "She couldn\u2019t wake her baby boy to have lunch catered and to have reassurance that she wasn\u2019t abandoned? \n\nNTA.", "Tell him next time, you will wake him up and he can f@cking tell her", "NTA but your husband is a major AH. Where is his support for you? Why wasn't he standing up for you against his mom?", "NTA. So sorry you are stressed by your MIL staying for so long. With both language and cultural differences that can be hard. Her rant was exactly that a rant and totally uncalled for. You do not need to tell her everything and I would suggest going out every couple of days for an hour or so without her. Wake hubby up to translate that for each time. Remind him it is your home too and your life is not controlled by his mother ever.", "NTA. but you have a husband problem along with a MIL problem.", "Well if he wants you to explain things to her from now on he's not allowed to nap... Because he needs to be ready and willing to translate for you anytime you need to go somewhere! He's being ridiculous! And so is she! You are NTA! You have every right to go wherever you want whenever you want from your house and if the woman can't make herself a damn sandwich then that is her problem not yours!", "Why would you, an independent adult, would have to explain to a guest where to you are going, when are  are you coming back before you leave your own house?\n\nIf she wants to come and \"visit\" for a whole ass month them she needs to find a way to communicate and learn to use public transportation or stay in the house, you are not her freaking chauffeur, and your husband next to grow a pair stand up to mommy and defend his wife.\n\nNTA, obviously", "NTA, you didn't abandon her she was with her son, what you do is really none of her business. You attempted to inform her also. Ask you husband if he is sure this is the hill he is willing to die on. If I was you I would take you son and stay somewhere else till she is gone because no one needs a controlling B in their life.", "Nta she should be helping you out not giving you more worries", "NTA. At first I thought the title said you left your kid with her without asking while you went out. But no, you just took a short visit with your child to your brother's without your long-term houseguest (basically short-term roommate with how long she's staying). And you even did your best to let her know what you were doing. How can someone expect for you to do nothing without her for a month and a half? Even if you weren't struggling with sleep deprivation and PMS I don't think there's anything wrong with what you did. I'm sorry you're in this situation.", "NTA. Her son was home, so it\u2019s not like she was left alone with no transportation.", "NTA. Seems to me he\u2019s asking you to apologise to keep the peace rather than because you did anything wrong. Which is an Ahole move on his part. Unless this is part of their wider dynamic in which case this points to a wider problem with MIL. Also you need to have a serious chat to your husband about what is and is not expected of you when your MIL visits.", "NTA. He can babysit his mother. It is not unreasonable for you and your son to go some places without her. If she doesn' t like it she can go home early.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t her babysitter. You don\u2019t owe her an apology, it sounds like you\u2019ve been more than accommodating already.\nTime to put your foot down - his mother, his problem.", "NTA\n\nYou tried telling her the best you could but you also don\u2019t owe her any explanation or detail to where you\u2019re going. She wasn\u2019t home alone and her son could have woken up from his nap. She\u2019s also a grown adult who could get up and make her own lunch or her son could have made her some. Your husband needs to do better and take up for you. If it\u2019s going to continue to be an issue have the visit cut short and send her on back to her home.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur husband is an Ah. Do not give in to his mom's powerpay.", "NTA.   A good solution is to make your husband responsible for all communication with her, since there's a language barrier.   \n\nYou heading out and he is sleeping,  well he gets woke up to talk to his Mom.\n\nYou are taking your little one for a walk?  Time for him to interrupt his schedule and let his Mother know. \n\nEventually he will see your point", "Apology for what? Do not even think twice about doing so. Tell him maybe he should be up to tell her things. You're not underage, and her name isn't on your birth certificate. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou were out for an hour out of 1.5 months and she was triggered? After you actively tried to tell her the plans?\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t your husband tell her you were out? Why couldn\u2019t he make lunch? Why did he let her speak that way about you?\n\nIf she\u2019s triggered by your entire character then perhaps she shouldn\u2019t be staying in your home at all. And if she\u2019s racist then she definitely shouldn\u2019t be staying in your home at all.\n\nTell your husband that not only will you not be apologising, but that he owes you an apology for letting her treat and speak about you this way. And that him letting her treat and speak about you this way must stop.", "NTA. Ask him how are you suppose to notify her if there is a language barrier between you and your MIL. She and him are expecting a lot when you two cannot even communicate. Your husband needs to recognize that before going any further with his arguement. Also you are your kids mother, you have the right to take the child anywhere you wish provided its a safe environment. \n\nHe needs to deal with the fact you can be independent from him, his mom needs to learn how to communicate with you and that you are your own person.", "NTA\n\nShe does not need to know your every love especially when your husband is there. Why are you responsible for her when she\u2019s your husbands mother?", "NTA.   Explain she\u2019s in America and you are not answerable to her.  You don\u2019t need to tell her when you\u2019ll be back and let your husband understand you are not apologizing for going out to meet your siblings.", "NTA!  You have every right to still live your own life, while she is visiting for over a month and has parked herself on your household!  You owe her NOTHING in way of explanations or anything else.  Her son was in the home, napping, as was one of the children.  She wasn't left alone.  You are not obligated to take her everywhere with you, and I commend you for doing as much as you have done with her and for her.\n\nRemind your hubby that she is a guest in YOUR home.  You are the lady of the household and don't want or need her opinions or approval.  And tell him that, as your wedded partner, he should be supportive of his wife and family, and not let his mother butt in where she isn't welcomed to!\n\nI had the MIL from Hades, from my second marriage.  We lived out in Las Vegas and she came to visit us for several weeks.  She was the same type of busy body who didn't believe any women were good enough for her sons.  She found fault with everyone, and never held back the opportunity to tell us that.  One day, she was criticizing something about my teen daughter (she butted head with her, often) and I'd just had enough.  I told my husband he needed to take her to the airport ASAP, and until she was gone, I'd be out staying in the RV.  And that's what I did.  My daughter and son joined me, out there.  It was SO peaceful!  Next day, she was gone, and life went on.  A person can only take so much!  LOL", "NTA.  You told her where you were going, and your husband was home.  A month and a half is way too long of a visit.", "NTA but your husband and his mommy are. Her son can babysit her, not your job.", "I would apologize to her and mention you leave in the home of the free where a woman can go and come as she pleases", "NTA. Her son was also there, you didn't abandon her! Tell hubby that he needs to tell her to back off.", "She says she is triggered by your entire personality **and your husband translated that to you AND expected you to apologise for it**\u2026!?\n\nHe thinks so little of your entire personality that he\u2019s ok with his mother insulting it and insisting that you apologise for it?\n\nYou have a husband problem here, far more than a MIL problem. \n\n> \u201cshe is triggered [that]\u2026 I got mad at my husband a few times\u201d\n\nSounds like she\u2019s going to be hearing some more of that in the house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm pretty sure you can leave YOUR house with YOUR child without reporting to your MIL.  Especially seeing that HER son was still in said house.", "Seriously, this all falls on your husband.

Her son was there if she needed someone to fix her lunch, you have enough on your plate. You certainly don't need permission to visit your family with or without your son. That old school submissive wife bs just doesn't cut it when it's an excuse to be rude, controlling, or abusive.

Your husband needs to learn to stand up to his mom, it\u2019s not your job to make all of her meals, especially if you have a child to take care of, and it\u2019s absolutely none of her business where you\u2019re going and for how long. You aren\u2019t a child, and you aren\u2019t her child. You are free to come and go as you please with your own child. As a fellow middle eastern woman, who has a small child and a MIL with a language barrier who was just staying with us for several weeks, I am sorry you\u2019re going through this because I know what it feels like. I went out one day with my daughter and all I said before I left was that we were going out. When I came home I felt like she was unhappy with me, but I was so tired of feeling trapped in my home, feeling like she had to go everywhere with me, like I wasn\u2019t allowed to just live my own life while she was here.\n\nShe isn\u2019t your boss, and she isn\u2019t your mother. She doesn\u2019t get to control any aspect of your life, and your husband needs to learn that you and your child are his main family and priority now, not her. He needs to tell her that you are free to come and go as you please and if she is hungry, she has been here long enough to know where you keep the food.
