Those five years were the best time of my life and I was head over heels in love with her the entire time. She was the most wonderful woman I\u2019ve ever known. I have two kids from previous relationships and she treated them better than their bio moms. She bought them great gifts for their birthday and Christmas when their own bio moms wouldn\u2019t even call. After we got married, my late wife adopted my kids and they became our kids. \n\nHer family are AHs and never really approved of our relationship. They didn\u2019t meet my kids until the day of the wedding. Then it took my late wife arguing with them for months before they included the kids in family kid\u2019s outings such as trips to Disney or vacations. Before she became sick, she was in a huge fight with her parents because they had a college fund for the rest of the grandkids except for our kids. Once she was diagnosed, they felt guilty and finally started college funds for ours.\n\nWhen she passed, we\u2019ve had limited contact with her family. Last month I saw on social media that they\u2019re planning a Christmas in Italy (they\u2019re from there and still have family there) but our kids are not invited. I called them to chew them out. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re not taking me but these two kids are legally hers and are inheriting her estate. They\u2019re legally their grandkids. \n\nWe\u2019re in a huge fight. They already left the country but I\u2019m making it known on all of their social media that they\u2019re actively excluding their grandkids.

I'm sorry for your loss, I really am. \n\nBut, you knew that your in-laws weren't fans of you. You don't like them and call them assholes. You admit that they didn't approve of your relationship. Now that their daughter is gone, why would they put time and effort into maintaining relationships with you and your kids?\n\nYou saw your wife as your kids' mom. She saw herself as their mom. But they never did. They saw them as yours. And now, with their daughter gone. They don't see the point of doing so. And they're allowed to do so. \n\nYou must have known how they felt. Them not maintaining contact, and now, involving the kids in their activities can not have come as a total surprise (I hope). So why would you want to subject your kids to people who clearly don't like them?", "YTA.

And then making a social media campaign against them seems excessive.", "YTA\n\nWould you like to be referred to as her \"ex-husband\"?

Their daughter/sister married a guy with 2 children from 2 different women. Then they\u2019re guilted into providing college funds for 2 children with whom they have no connection. Now the deadbeat dad is trying to pubic shame them into paying for and taking these 2 children overseas to meet complete strangers.\n\nYTA x millions.", "YTA. Your children were rejected by their biological mothers and now they\u2019re being rejected by their legal mother\u2019s parents. I\u2019m sure that hurts but your wife\u2019s parents made it clear before she died that they don\u2019t consider your kids to be their grandkids, despite the fact that your wife adopted them. What makes you think that you can bully them into doing something that even your wife couldn\u2019t convince them to do? An even better question is why would you want your kids to have a relationship with people who don\u2019t want a relationship with them? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.", "YTA OP seems to be trying to force the kids (we actually don't know their ages, it's not the same leaving the country with a 6yo than a 14yo) down the grandparents throat yo make sure they don't leave them out of the inheritance/college fund/money.\n\nAlso, why would OP want his kids to be away from him on Christmas?", "YTA to your ex-in-laws and your children.\n\nYour in-laws don\u2019t consider the children their grandchildren.  Right or wrong, that\u2019s how they feel and you can\u2019t force a relationship between them and your children, especially now, that their daughter is gone.  \n\nAs to your children, why?  Why are you pushing this?  How is it benefitting them for you to have this attitude and posting on social media where they might read it one day and find out they were excluded?  Clearly, the in-laws aren\u2019t going to change.  Just drop it and move on.", "YTA and you lost all possible moral high ground when you took to social media.\n\nLook, these people have made it clear they do not consider your children family. Its absolutely tragic for your children but with your wife gone, the familial connection is gone. I'm unclear on the ages of your children so my guess is the age they came into the family comes into play here, too. \n\nIf they didn't care for you and didn't approve of your relationship with her, they won't be seeking out connection to your children. It sounds like they were kind of strong armed by your wife into having a relationship with your children and they didn't necessarily want one. And, if you are as petty as you sound, I can't blame them. It doesn't matter how much you loved your wife - you come across as a royally entitled person which no doubt rubbed them the wrong way right out of the gate.\n\nYour former ILs do not owe your children extravagant trips and you are incredibly entitled to think they do. Likewise, there is an EXTREMELY good chance that your MIL and FIL will be changing the college funds over to their other grand children's names.", "YTA. I understand your hurt, but the mistake you and your wife made was trying to force her family to care about your kids simply because she did. She made the choice to be in a relationship with you. She made the choice to love and adopt your kids. Her family never made that choice. You can't force someone to care about your children simply because your wife adopted them. I know this going to be an unpopular opinion with people that gets me down voted but all the decisions they made to include you were only after being forced/guilted by their daughter. Not because they genuinely wanted to connect with you or your children and make them apart of their family. So it's not suprising that once she passed they no longer wanted any connection with you because they never considered you or your kids apart of their family. I know this sounds cold because it is, but it's the truth. It doesn't matter that your wife legally adopted your kids that wasn't going to automatically make her family love them. Your upset because you couldn't force her family to accpet your children. You can't force bonds that people don't want to make. Nothing will be gained by blasting them on social media. It's not going to make your feel better. Maybe it will make them look bad, but maybe theydon't care how it looks to strangers and members outside of their family. It's not going to suddenly make them open their hearts to your children. You need to move on and focus on doing what is  best for your children. What you are doing right now is only reminding them that they have been rejected by your wife's family. Please keep that in mind they were your wife's family never yours. In the ideal world you would have blended together in one loving family, but that never happened. You can't force people to care about your or your children. Focusing on this is only hurting you and your children.", "YTA, they're not their grandkids and you come across like a gold digger", "YTA. \n\nTwo different kids with two different women and neither moms are in the kids life is a HUGE red flag right out of the gate. It speaks volumes about the type of women you choose to penis. \n\nItalians tend to be very traditional. If you had an ex wife with whom you shared custody, it might be different. If you were widowed, same. But two kids with two different women and they aren't in the picture....that is sketch.\n\nIn their eyes, you married their daughter, not because you loved her, but because you wanted a mother for your kids. How much of their raising did you foist off on her as soon as you were married?\n\nYou call them AHs out of the gate with no context.\n\nTheir daughter is gone. And now they have to put up with an entitled widower who thinks that the late wife should still provide for those children after her death. \n\nThe \"family\" would have been literal strangers to your kids. You are angry because they didn't fly you and your kids on an all expense paid vacation. \n\nGoing on their social media pages was childish.", "YTA. Go blast the real maternal grandparents of your children who are the parents of their real bio mother and leave these strangers alone. Holy crap. The entitlement is strong with this one!", "**YTA**\n\nI'd say E-S-H but your behaviour is so egregiously problematic here that it overshadows anything your former in-laws may be doing to exclude your kids, which MIGHT have been figured out between you if you hadn't thrown a grenade into it all like this. \n\n**What do you even hope to accomplish with all this?** Or have you even stopped to think about that? Because you certainly can't fix or build a good, meaningful relationship for your kids with their grandparents by viciously shaming them into it. The only possible outcome from \"calling them out\" on social media is to make the estrangement even worse. The nastier you are to them, the less they're going to want you or your kids around. Why would they want ANY relationship with you if this is how you interact with them: by trying to publicly shame them when you're upset with them? You're basically guaranteeing that they go no contact with you.\n\nYou wouldn't have been an AH to quietly express your disappointment to them, to explain to them PRIVATELY that like them, you and your kids are grieving the loss of your wife, and you were really hoping to strengthen the bond between them and the kids now for her sake.\n\nBut you're a massive AH for demanding that the relationship play out in any one particular way, such as with expensive overseas vacations, even if they're taking other family members. Grandparents - even bio ones - sometimes do things with some members of the family and not others. And you're an even bigger AH to your kids for destroying any remnants of goodwill between you by going full battle mode against them over this. No one wants to be friendly and loving to someone who treats them like the enemy. I don't know if you just weren't thinking or if you're really this clueless, but you've likely destroyed any chance your kids had at a relationship with them.", "YTA - your wife may have considered them her kids and that\u2019s lovely, but you can\u2019t bully other people into feeling the same. Your children are not entitled to free trips and I can\u2019t imagine that they would even want to go to Italy with a pack of virtual strangers.", "Regrettably, YTA\n\nThe grandparents aren\u2019t the biological ones and your wife adopted those kids because she loved you so much.\n\nThey don\u2019t feel they owe you or the kids what you believe they owe you. \n\nThis is not likely to change and any efforts to prolong coming to the conclusion that this is how it\u2019s going to be is just going to damage everyone involved. \n\nThe only person who can control the situation now is you.", "YTA\n\nYou can't force your children on to them", "You did not say how old your kids were when they met them or now but it doesn't matter. They don't consider your children theirs. You gain nothing by blasting them publicly and having your children feel bad. Honestly it just makes you look bad. \nSo, sorry for your loss, but give this one up.", "YTA for attempting to force a relationship where it doesn't exist.\n\nIt is not the job of your deceased wife's parents to make up for the lack of having their bio mother or bio mothers' parents in the kids' life. Realistically your children were not in the family for any significant amount of time - do they actually have any kind of relationship with your dead wife's parents?\n\nDo you have any kind of relationship with these people now that your wife is dead.\n\nIt is amazing that they set up a college fund for these kids - you should not look for more. You seem to be very focused on material benefits - i.e. your wife bought \"great\" presents; the kids weren't asked to go on an expensive holiday. \n\nLogistically how would the grandparents even take the kids to Italy? It is extremely hard to take care of children let alone on an extended foreign trip. I would imagine that the parents of their other grandchildren went along on the trip so the grandparents weren't responsible for taking care of them. Aside from the cost of tickets, accommodations. food etc, there are legal issues involved. \n\nAlso the reality is that absent unusual circumstances, the families of dead spouses don't generally have a lot of contact unless it is through the grandchildren OR the marriage was of such long standing that the living spouse was emotionally a part of the family. You were only married for five years - the kids were only in their lives for five years and so even though legally your wife adopted the kids at some point, most grandparents would not really have the same relationship as they do with bio grandkids who they have known from birth and also of course because they have continuing relationships with their own bio children and their living spouses.", "Info: They never approved of the relationship. I\u2019m sensing missing info. How old are you and how old was their daughter? How old are your kids? You do realize acting entitled to their money is a sure fire way yo get them to revoke the college funds. And you say the kids will inherit your wife\u2019s estate. But does she have an estate on her own or are you banking on money being left to your kids by them in their will?", "YTA. They are not the legal grandparents.   Sorry.  Your wife hounded them in to a relationship they did not want.  They tried to make  your wife's last days better.  Let it go.", "YTA. Not their responsibility. They are being inconsiderate of your wife's wishes but sounds like they never had a connection with your kids. They didn't adopt your kids. Your wife did. Tbf, I wouldn't want my kids alone with them if that was their attitude. Your kids have no rights to their gifts.", "Were the in laws ever warm & grandparenty to your kids? Because you might just have to accept that they don't care about your kids & never will.", "YTA. You can\u2019t force your ex IL\u2019s to have a relationship with your kids when they don\u2019t have an emotional attachment to them. \n\nLooks like you\u2019re gold digging by mentioning college funds and inherited estates. Ask your kids\u2019 bio moms to fund their life and college and stay away from your ex IL\u2019s.", "YTA\n\nLook... I've BEEN the kid in this situation. I'm an adopted step-kid. Adopted dad's parents never saw me as their grandkid. \n\nI was disappointed at first, yes. I had been looking forward to having grandparents. But the truth is there is I came into the family as a step kid and they felt no particular affection for me, and I had no pre-existing affection for them. They weren't part of my life and I didn't think about it after the first couple of months.\n\nIf I had been adopted by both of my parents as a baby, maybe that would have been different, but I wasn't.\n\nYou can't force these people to see their daughter's adopted step kids as equivalent to biological children, and sad as it is, they have that right.", "YTA\nI get where you're coming from and I truly feel for you, but your late wife adopted the kids, not the in-laws. It sucks, and in a perfect world they would welcome them with open arms, but they are under no obligation to do so. Your kids don't just automatically become their grandkids because your wife chose to adopt them. They have to choose that relationship for themselves. I totally understand why you would be upset that they don't treat them like their grandkids, but I would never call them out because it's not my place to tell someone else how to live their life.", "You\u2019re are gonna make it way worse for your kids in the long run. Accept the fact they don\u2019t see your kids as family and do like Elsa, let it go.

Stop setting the kids up for rejection from people who want nothing to do with them.  It's unhealthy.", "YTA. They are not your kid's blood family. They are legally YOUR LATE WIFE's children.

Legally these are their grandchildren but emotionally they aren\u2019t. It\u2019s sad, but they aren\u2019t bonded. Calling to chew them out sure isn\u2019t going to make your former in laws want to embrace your children. Honestly they don\u2019t have to take your kids to Italy. They can pick and choose any amount of family members to include or exclude in the trip. Also, they can do that with the college fund and their will. Please consider that the college fund and any inheritance can be changed or removed. You might want to play nice, even if it really sucks. It is their choice to do whatever they want with their own money whether that\u2019s a trip to Italy, a college fund or with their estate.", "YTA.\n\nI sympathize with your feelings, really do.\n\nBut you're trying very hard to force them as their grandkids, when they are really your kids that your wife adopted and your grandparents did not want to, I guess.  BTW, your kids have your parents as grandparents, and your ex's parents as grnadparents, even though they seem out of the picture.\n\nBetter to let it go.\n\nAnd if you are really going scorched earth on this, do you think it really will change their minds?", "I'm sorry, but YTA. They had a relationship with your kids because of your wife. Without your late wife, legally or not, the kids  have no bond with them. They aren't their grandkids. You are not going to come out looking good in this situation and you are going to be hurting your kids in the long run. Listen to your parents.", "They are not legally anything to them.

Sometimes you just need to not force a relationship with people if they don\u2019t want it.

Regardless of your late wife's relationship with your children-from-the-other-baby-mamas, it is NOT her parents' responsibility to pay for two children that they -- at the end of the day -- really have nothing to do with.
