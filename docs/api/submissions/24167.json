Parents split up, crappy divorce yadda-yadda and everything y'know? So first let me tell you that before the woman I am about to talk about, my dad (39) was dating a 21 y/o. This timeline would mean that when I was in the 8th grade, this woman was a senior in highschool. Let that sink in a moment. Gross, I know. Thank you. Moving on.\n\nI (17) got a text recently from my dad (40). Telling me he wants me to meet this woman he likes that we'll call Clarissa (41). At this point I had never heard her name in my life. I told him I don't even know anything about her, why would I want to meet her? He gave me this huge paragraph, mostly about her kids, her bad marriage she's getting out of, over sharing some things about his mental health that he shouldn't be doing to his kid. From that one paragraph he proceeded to ask how I feel about her knowing what I now know. I'm sorry but one paragraph??\n\nWeeks would go by, and he would keep talking to me and bring her up out of nowhere; From, \"She's been in a really bad marriage for nearly 20 years and she wants to go slow, I'm thinking once her divorce is finalized\" to, \"Clarissa would really like to meet you\". This is when I told him \"I don't wanna meet someone you're interested in, yet not dating. A lot of things could happen between now and her finalized divorce.\"\n\nHe hasn't contacted me since. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: I would like to clarify that I have no problems with either of my parents dating other people, they were dating other people before they were officially divorced and they've been separated for years. My dad made unwanted advances towards my mother, offering her money. This is my issue with it. I honestly feel really bad for Clarissa, who is interested in my dad but doesn't know the things he's been doing.", "created_utc": 1691480395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lb43y/aita_for_bluntly_telling_my_dad_i_dont_want_to/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He shouldn\u2019t expect you to wanna meet his love interests and form a bond with them if you aren\u2019t sure they\u2019ll stick around or generally be pleasant. Especially when she\u2019s fresh out of a bad 20yr marriage that\u2019s hasn\u2019t even officially ended. Unlikely that she\u2019ll wanna jump into a long term serious relationship as soon as her divorce finalizes without taking time to gather herself.\n\n(Edited typo)", "There\u2019s a lot of info missing here (the yadda yadda part) because clearly you\u2019re angry at your dad.\n\nI understand the age gap in the other relationship grossed you out but you seem to be inventing reasons to dislike his new (age appropriate) relationship (meaning friendship since there\u2019s no romantic relationship yet). It\u2019s normal not knowing a person before meeting them - the same thing applies if you would bring home a new partner - and is no reason not to meet them. \n\nThe reason he\u2019s trying to get you to meet might be because he wants to see if you get along first, before he gets too emotionally invested in somebody you\u2019ll dislike. He cares about what you think and you\u2019re kind of blowing him off. \n\nI\u2019m going with NAH for now, because divorces are hard to navigate for everyone involved. But yeah if you\u2019re interested in having a relationship with your dad, it goes both ways - if he hasn\u2019t contacted you lately, you can go ahead and contact him.", "> I told him I don't even know anything about her, why would I want to meet her?    \n\nI mean... that's why you meet her.  So you'll know her and know things about her.    \n\nI think i'm going to go with NAH..... obviously you have some issues with your dad that you need to get worked out with him or a therapist or something.  That doesn't make you an asshole.  Your dad is trying to keep you involved in his life, and that doesn't make him an asshole either.", ">Clarissa would really like to meet you\"\n\nBecause he's been over sharing about you too. \n\nPops is overstepping. As it pertains to dating: I don't want to meet any friends/family's dates until it's at least semi-serious. Even then, it's your choice. \n\nDad has some issues...but I wouldn't call him an AH because of this scenario.", "Small YTA. I grant you that you are still young and your dad hasn't been the best man out there. However, you seem to want him to stay single for the rest of his life. That's a child and teenager's perception of mature relationships. In general teenagers can't see their parents as sexually active beeings,  it grosses them out. I recommend to meet her, but with clearly communicated boundaries. You can tell that you aren't interested in a close relationship with her now, but that you are open to meet her every now and then. I also recommend having the meetings outside your father's house like going to a restaurant or doing an activity together (e.g. a museum that is interesting for all age groups). It guarantees a positive aspect of the day for everybody, but also provides for small talk. You can determine your interaction based on the small talk.\n\nMeeting in the house, puts too much pressure on everybody and at your age, you most likely haven't yet acquired enough social experience to navigate such a situation. You might want  to know her better. You might think that's she is a cow, but actually a good match for your dad (in this case keep the common activity level). You might think she is a cow and not a good match for your dad (Do you want to train your social skills around people, you do not particularly like?).", "YTA. You complain about him dating someone too young then when he meets someone age appropriate you don't like that either.\n\nHe over-shared, I'll give you that, but that seems to be because you refused to meet someone you don't know. As a general rule, when you meet someone for the first time you don't know much about them. That's the point.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s entirely possible. I missed if OP\u2019s gender was mentioned anywhere - I assumed OP was a girl, but maybe not? \nAnyway, yeah, I don\u2019t think daddy dearest would ask OP\u2019s opinion about the high schooler - or maybe he did (there\u2019s a lot of missing context that fits into \u2018yadda yadda\u2019), and OP made their opinion clear?

He\u2019s not respecting your wishes or hers. You don\u2019t introduce someone to your children (who don\u2019t even wanna meet her) that is just getting a divorce. What\u2019s his deal?

Are they not reading that he won\u2019t take no for an answer, and neither him nor Clarissa know what it means to move slowly in a relationship?", "NTA\n\nMy rule of thumb has always been that I wouldn't introduce my kid to anyone for at LEAST the first 3 months of dating. And if it was a slow evolving thing - 6 mths. Which has lead to junior meeting 1 (!) guy in the 13 years, I've been divorced from his dad. There is WAAAY too much going on in Clarissas life right now for that to be anything ANY of the kids - hers and OP's dads - should be involved in.", "NTA.

But on the the hand, he is enthusiastic about her and he wants to share his joy.", "NTA. As a kid who had a dad who dated/ introduced me a lot of women, I get it. While your dad may not be dating a /lot/ of women, he is trying to introduce you to his, essentially, situationship, which you can\u2019t guarantee will work out. You don\u2019t know how long she will be in his/ your life. I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t wanna start to build that relationship up. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole by asking you to meet her, but you are certainly not an asshole for saying no.\n\nHe is kind of an asshole for trying to give you a guilt trip about it though. You are his kid, you aren\u2019t responsible for catering to a complete stranger to make them feel better.", "NTA, just because someone is \"family\" doesn't mean they have the right to make you feel hurt or uncomfortable, boundaries apply to relatives too.", "NTA. My parents got divorce in 2015 because of my father cheated on my mom. Then he became another person, much different than what I knew my hole life. Anyway, he tried to make us kids to meet his new girlfriends (not the woman he cheated with), but we were never interested because he was always changing partner. We don't talk anymore because of other shit he did through the years, but I understand your feeling.", "NTA ily bestie /p", "I hadn't even thought about this! Thank you it's always very helpful to see perspectives from other people viewing in!", "I disagree. OP clearly stated that her boundary is that her father and this person have to actually be serious before she meets them. She never said she wouldn\u2019t meet them at all. Just that she wants to know that the time/ energy she is going to invest in this person will actually be worth something. It\u2019s not about whether or not she will like her fathers new partner at all.\n\nWhich is actually quite mature. As a kid who\u2019s dad had a rotating slew of partners who I got introduced to asap, it gets old.

In the end they \u201cbroke up\u201d because he told me they had previously hooked up in university but she stated she didn\u2019t want a serious relationship. He assumed after 20yrs she had changed her mind, but she hadn\u2019t. So I got to meet his old university hook up/present hook up? It was so weird, I was 16 and didn\u2019t need that. Thankfully, he introduced me to his next romantic interest after they had been dating for a year, that was fine. By then he was actually properly dating her and had discussed plans. \n\nAt this present moment your dad is just interested in this woman who he getting out of a 20yr marriage.

You don't owe your parents anything in regards to their relationships.  I'm 32 and been going through the same thing with both of my parents (both divorced multiple times) it's not worth it.

It sounds alot more like he wants to bring you around her for her sake/seal the deal kind of situation.", "You ARE NOT, you need to tell your dad that you are not interested in his dating life and if he wants to continue spending time with you to Not bring it up again,  that when you want to know about it YOU will ask.", "NTA Totally understandable that you do not wish to be invested in your Dad\u2019s love life. Tell him that you only want to meet people whom he is serious about eg  has been in a relationship for at least 3 months. You don\u2019t need to hear about each flavour of the month.
