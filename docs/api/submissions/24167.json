Parents split up, crappy divorce yadda-yadda and everything y'know? So first let me tell you that before the woman I am about to talk about, my dad (39) was dating a 21 y/o. This timeline would mean that when I was in the 8th grade, this woman was a senior in highschool. Let that sink in a moment. Gross, I know. Thank you. Moving on.\n\nI (17) got a text recently from my dad (40). Telling me he wants me to meet this woman he likes that we'll call Clarissa (41). At this point I had never heard her name in my life. I told him I don't even know anything about her, why would I want to meet her? He gave me this huge paragraph, mostly about her kids, her bad marriage she's getting out of, over sharing some things about his mental health that he shouldn't be doing to his kid. From that one paragraph he proceeded to ask how I feel about her knowing what I now know. I'm sorry but one paragraph??\n\nWeeks would go by, and he would keep talking to me and bring her up out of nowhere; From, \"She's been in a really bad marriage for nearly 20 years and she wants to go slow, I'm thinking once her divorce is finalized\" to, \"Clarissa would really like to meet you\". This is when I told him \"I don't wanna meet someone you're interested in, yet not dating. A lot of things could happen between now and her finalized divorce.\"\n\nHe hasn't contacted me since. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: I would like to clarify that I have no problems with either of my parents dating other people, they were dating other people before they were officially divorced and they've been separated for years. My dad made unwanted advances towards my mother, offering her money. This is my issue with it. I honestly feel really bad for Clarissa, who is interested in my dad but doesn't know the things he's been doing.", "created_utc": 1691480395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lb43y/aita_for_bluntly_telling_my_dad_i_dont_want_to/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He shouldn\u2019t expect you to wanna meet his love interests and form a bond with them if you aren\u2019t sure they\u2019ll stick around or generally be pleasant. Especially when she\u2019s fresh out of a bad 20yr marriage that\u2019s hasn\u2019t even officially ended. Unlikely that she\u2019ll wanna jump into a long term serious relationship as soon as her divorce finalizes without taking time to gather herself.\n\n(Edited typo)", "There\u2019s a lot of info missing here (the yadda yadda part) because clearly you\u2019re angry at your dad.\n\nI understand the age gap in the other relationship grossed you out but you seem to be inventing reasons to dislike his new (age appropriate) relationship (meaning friendship since there\u2019s no romantic relationship yet). It\u2019s normal not knowing a person before meeting them - the same thing applies if you would bring home a new partner - and is no reason not to meet them. \n\nThe reason he\u2019s trying to get you to meet might be because he wants to see if you get along first, before he gets too emotionally invested in somebody you\u2019ll dislike. He cares about what you think and you\u2019re kind of blowing him off. \n\nI\u2019m going with NAH for now, because divorces are hard to navigate for everyone involved. But yeah if you\u2019re interested in having a relationship with your dad, it goes both ways - if he hasn\u2019t contacted you lately, you can go ahead and contact him.", "> I told him I don't even know anything about her, why would I want to meet her?    \n\nI mean... that's why you meet her.  So you'll know her and know things about her.    \n\nI think i'm going to go with NAH..... obviously you have some issues with your dad that you need to get worked out with him or a therapist or something.  That doesn't make you an asshole.  Your dad is trying to keep you involved in his life, and that doesn't make him an asshole either.", ">Clarissa would really like to meet you\"\n\nBecause he's been over sharing about you too. \n\nPops is overstepping. As it pertains to dating: I don't want to meet any friends/family's dates until it's at least semi-serious. Even then, it's your choice. \n\nDad has some issues...but I wouldn't call him an AH because of this scenario.", "Small YTA. I grant you that you are still young and your dad hasn't been the best man out there. However, you seem to want him to stay single for the rest of his life. That's a child and teenager's perception of mature relationships. In general teenagers can't see their parents as sexually active beeings,  it grosses them out. I recommend to meet her, but with clearly communicated boundaries. You can tell that you aren't interested in a close relationship with her now, but that you are open to meet her every now and then. I also recommend having the meetings outside your father's house like going to a restaurant or doing an activity together (e.g. a museum that is interesting for all age groups). It guarantees a positive aspect of the day for everybody, but also provides for small talk. You can determine your interaction based on the small talk.\n\nMeeting in the house, puts too much pressure on everybody and at your age, you most likely haven't yet acquired enough social experience to navigate such a situation. You might want  to know her better. You might think that's she is a cow, but actually a good match for your dad (in this case keep the common activity level). You might think she is a cow and not a good match for your dad (Do you want to train your social skills around people, you do not particularly like?).", "YTA. You complain about him dating someone too young then when he meets someone age appropriate you don't like that either.\n\nHe over-shared, I'll give you that, but that seems to be because you refused to meet someone you don't know. As a general rule, when you meet someone for the first time you don't know much about them. That's the point.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
