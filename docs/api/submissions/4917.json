Together they gave me the gift of two grandchildren (M 11 and D 9). They live in the USA but visit Sapin and Europe frequently, about once or twice a year, usually staying at his parents' house. I wish I can be so lucky. I've only been to Europe once, during my honeymoon. (I am now I divorce from her father)  \n\nCurrently, I am visiting my daughter and her family for the Christmas Holiday. I used my SIL computer to look something up online (I know I shouldn't have, but his laptop was right there on the coffee table and all I needed to do was a quick Google search). When I opened his computer, I was horrified to see my SIL email open to find out that he and my daughter's family had booked a vacation to a nudist resort in France with their, my grand *children*. I dug a little further and clicked on the website of the resort to find that their even children featured on there as well. I guess you can say all of the images were \"tastefully\" done because non-of their privates were exposed in the images, and I know that Europe is more liberal when it comes to nudity, but I can't see my grandchildren being exposed in this way.\n\nI confronted my daughter about it, she was upset that I snooped, which I admitted was wrong, but she was also arguing with me, saying that I had no right to tell her where she could take her kids on vacation. I simply tried to tell her how I was fine with her and her husband going to a place like that (though I wish I didn't know about it), but not the grandkids, and how it is inappropriate for the kids to go to such a place because they can be preyed upon. \n\n I also told her how never paraded naked around her, when she was growing up and asked why she thinks it's okay to be naked in front of the kids, especially my grandson. She told me how I was being overdramatic, and how they let the kids play nude on the Spanish beaches for years with my SIL parents, thinking nothing of it, calling it \"Holidaying European style\". She also informed me it was how her husband grew up, and many families in Spain still let their kids play naked on the beach. I asked if my SIL parents were also naked when they went to the beach, and she said, yes, and again I was horrified. She told me this is why she never told me because she knew how I would react. \n\nI told her I understood they enjoy going to Europe to see SIL's family, but why can't she take a normal vacation when she goes? Then I started to tell her about the trip I took on my honeymoon, and she said tour groups are not the real Europe, that my SIL is Spanish, he is European, and that I am going to have to respect the cultural differences, and in how they are raising my grandchildren.

Less is better\n\nEdit: Took out \"It's in the word\" from the first sentence because technically it's not. It's spelled differently.

There are kids and families all around, okay with their nakedness. There are even playgrounds and kid only places for them. If you say resorts should be \"adults only\" then that implies that nudity is wrong and only sexual, which it isn't. Why would children need to consent? Do they need to consent to wearing clothes? Going to school? Going to church? Nudity is no different, it is western (mostly American society) that makes it different..I understand that you and the OP, are concerned for the children, but honestly nothing happens. Because if someone tries to approach a kid who isn't their own, people around will be like \"what the fuck are you doing?\" Plus kids raised in nudist (naturist) environments quickly learn about appropriate and inappropriate nudity, and how nudist could be exploited.", "Going to a few places for a few weeks many years ago does not mean you understand the culture", "An art museum is different than a beach.

Their parents get to decide how they\u2019re raised and you simply get to enjoy what time you\u2019re allowed with them without commentary on their parents, because that would be way outside your lane. Mmmkay?\n\nYTA, if it wasn\u2019t immediately clear.", "Yes.", "But they have done this for years, the kids are used to it and they obviously are a family who are not prudes so the kids would tell them if they felt uncomfortable but if you grow up with it, it is normal.

I can usually decode autocorrect, but not here.", "I feel like you missed the point I was trying to make. \nI\u2019ve been to naturist events not a resort and no it\u2019s not sexual, however, there is still a minimal heightened risk that there is someone there for the wrong reason. People wouldn\u2019t have the balls to approach a child or do anything inappropriate, but they can still think about it which is gross enough for me. My Dad used to keep magazines of nudist resorts under his bed and often talked about wanting to go to one. He was completely only wanting to go because he wanted to be around naked children. \n\nNo kids don\u2019t need to consent to go to school, as that\u2019s proven to be beneficial for the child and it\u2019s necessary to function in society. However, yes church should be a decision the child makes. Church and religion has caused countless amounts of trauma and damaged to children and it\u2019s not a necessity. I loved going to church as a kid, but thinking back on some of the lessons and moral judgments I was taught as a child, there is no way in hell that I would let my kids with their developing minds be taught that you\u2019re evil if you get a divorce, are queer, have a child out of wedlock or use contraception.", "And acting like she's some cultural expert because she went there on her honeymoon once a few decades ago and saw some nude art in a museum lol", "I just looked it up for scotland and it sort of is and isn't illegal, just need to not be 'publicly indecent' or cause 'distress and alarm'.

Of course. Same reason people can become teachers for the wrong reason. Could people fantasize about children? Yes. But they can fantasize about dressed children too. Look at the comments adult men make about  Millie Bobby Brown. \n\nIt sounds to be as if you have your own conflict about the issue, because of your father, who DID have the wrong intentions. I am also familiar with the magazines, which you mentioned. Those are a dark period of history for naturism, and I am happy to say naturist magazines now, BN, H&E, N&N (out of the USA) feature very few, if any, photos of children.

Nope. Understandable. Everyone has past experiences that color their current point of view good or bad. For example, I don't drive. I was in a bad car accident as a kid, so when I get behind the wheel of a car and a car rides up on my shoulder, I start having panic attacks. Even as a passenger, at times, if a car is passing, I will squeeze the handle tight till it passes. Could some CBT therapy help? Yes, but it isn't really impacting my life in a negative way, I live in the one part of the USA with good transportation.", "Oh, she was looking for was one person to agree with her, to prove her point.
