I wish I can be so lucky. I've only been to Europe once, during my honeymoon. (I am now I divorce from her father)  \n\nCurrently, I am visiting my daughter and her family for the Christmas Holiday. I used my SIL computer to look something up online (I know I shouldn't have, but his laptop was right there on the coffee table and all I needed to do was a quick Google search). When I opened his computer, I was horrified to see my SIL email open to find out that he and my daughter's family had booked a vacation to a nudist resort in France with their, my grand *children*. I dug a little further and clicked on the website of the resort to find that their even children featured on there as well. I guess you can say all of the images were \"tastefully\" done because non-of their privates were exposed in the images, and I know that Europe is more liberal when it comes to nudity, but I can't see my grandchildren being exposed in this way.\n\nI confronted my daughter about it, she was upset that I snooped, which I admitted was wrong, but she was also arguing with me, saying that I had no right to tell her where she could take her kids on vacation. I simply tried to tell her how I was fine with her and her husband going to a place like that (though I wish I didn't know about it), but not the grandkids, and how it is inappropriate for the kids to go to such a place because they can be preyed upon. \n\n I also told her how never paraded naked around her, when she was growing up and asked why she thinks it's okay to be naked in front of the kids, especially my grandson. She told me how I was being overdramatic, and how they let the kids play nude on the Spanish beaches for years with my SIL parents, thinking nothing of it, calling it \"Holidaying European style\". She also informed me it was how her husband grew up, and many families in Spain still let their kids play naked on the beach. I asked if my SIL parents were also naked when they went to the beach, and she said, yes, and again I was horrified. She told me this is why she never told me because she knew how I would react. \n\nI told her I understood they enjoy going to Europe to see SIL's family, but why can't she take a normal vacation when she goes? Then I started to tell her about the trip I took on my honeymoon, and she said tour groups are not the real Europe, that my SIL is Spanish, he is European, and that I am going to have to respect the cultural differences, and in how they are raising my grandchildren.

I got to see that my body was different from my friends' but they all were really good at helping us swim and I thought about that a lot when I got older because it was the only time I ever saw other people's bodies beneath the clothes other than actresses. I had something to remind me that we didn't all look like the people in TV and I had once been to a party where there were no clothes to hide behind and no one had said anything like the mean things my mom said about other women when she couldn't even see what their actual bodies looked like.\n\nBecause I was with a friend's family rather than my own, and it was a large family, I was honestly not very supervised. I have terrible eyesight, so I wound up approaching several strangers thinking they were the friend's dad.\n\nThe most common interactions I had with strange adults? \"Don't forget your backpack! You left it by the sandcastle\", \"No don't go that way! That part of the beach has broken glass\", and \"Make sure you put sunscreen on!\"\n\nYour grandkids are going in the company of a large group of their family, not near-strangers. They'll be surrounded by protection. We use our bodies for more than just sex and at a beach like this, seeing someone else-- child or adult-- naked is treated more or less like seeing a toddler naked. The automatic response is not \"Oh no the genitals are out! That means sex is imminent!\", it's \"Oh I guess they decided they were done with the clothes for today/ They got too hot/ The clothes were uncomfy.\"\n\nYTA. I understand it feels like a protective instinct because you associate nudity with sex, so you associate child nudity with child sex. That's the disconnect-- in a culture where nudity isn't intrinsically bound up with sexual intent, a naked child playing on the beach is just a child who decided swimming felt better without the suit today. \n\nI also understand that it's hard to think past that instinctual reaction. A lot of us have been taught our whole lives to always cover everything, and that the physical threat to you correlates directly to the amount of clothing you have on. If you are able to try, I think going to a nude hot spring or something similar would be a valuable experience.", "And what\u2019s the point of going to American style beaches .. in Europe? \n\nAnd yes, we all know there is a difference of art and people.
