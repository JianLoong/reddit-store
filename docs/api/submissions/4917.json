Together they gave me the gift of two grandchildren (M 11 and D 9). They live in the USA but visit Sapin and Europe frequently, about once or twice a year, usually staying at his parents' house. I wish I can be so lucky. I've only been to Europe once, during my honeymoon. (I am now I divorce from her father)  \n\nCurrently, I am visiting my daughter and her family for the Christmas Holiday. I used my SIL computer to look something up online (I know I shouldn't have, but his laptop was right there on the coffee table and all I needed to do was a quick Google search). When I opened his computer, I was horrified to see my SIL email open to find out that he and my daughter's family had booked a vacation to a nudist resort in France with their, my grand *children*. I dug a little further and clicked on the website of the resort to find that their even children featured on there as well. I guess you can say all of the images were \"tastefully\" done because non-of their privates were exposed in the images, and I know that Europe is more liberal when it comes to nudity, but I can't see my grandchildren being exposed in this way.\n\nI confronted my daughter about it, she was upset that I snooped, which I admitted was wrong, but she was also arguing with me, saying that I had no right to tell her where she could take her kids on vacation. I simply tried to tell her how I was fine with her and her husband going to a place like that (though I wish I didn't know about it), but not the grandkids, and how it is inappropriate for the kids to go to such a place because they can be preyed upon. \n\n I also told her how never paraded naked around her, when she was growing up and asked why she thinks it's okay to be naked in front of the kids, especially my grandson. She told me how I was being overdramatic, and how they let the kids play nude on the Spanish beaches for years with my SIL parents, thinking nothing of it, calling it \"Holidaying European style\". She also informed me it was how her husband grew up, and many families in Spain still let their kids play naked on the beach. I asked if my SIL parents were also naked when they went to the beach, and she said, yes, and again I was horrified. She told me this is why she never told me because she knew how I would react. \n\nI told her I understood they enjoy going to Europe to see SIL's family, but why can't she take a normal vacation when she goes? Then I started to tell her about the trip I took on my honeymoon, and she said tour groups are not the real Europe, that my SIL is Spanish, he is European, and that I am going to have to respect the cultural differences, and in how they are raising my grandchildren.

I had a friend who found out a new private school would be opening in the city we live in. So she wanted her daughter to attend with the least amount of financial burden on her as possible. So what does she do? Decided that the sliver of Puerto Rican ancestry she had was going to get her 6 year old a full scholarship. (I might add enrollment was strictly on a lottery you either got in or you didn't but she was crazy about this nonsense) so there i sat smh trying to deduce what was actually happening here , while she wrote the school board a letter explaining her parents journey to become citizens. To better their daughter and future granddaughter's life. I didn't bother to inform her that this was Ludacris. I just sat back and watched her kid go to public school with mine. She called me one night exploding about how they sent a sorry not sorry letter to her. My only reply was \"huh. Guess they didn't believe your story. Although next time you should probably consider the fact that Puerto Ricans are US citizens\" dead silence \"huh? I mean yeah but ... Huh?\" I excused myself and hung up.\n\n\nEdit to clarify:  her parents are from upstate NY as well as her great grandparents there's no struggle in this backstory, i know her family. They come from white privilege", "\u201cI wanted to be near my parents\u201d", "\"Spaniard\" is the actual term to refer to people from Spain, so in that sense she was accurate.\nWhat makes her TA (adding to the other points you made) is her need to specify \"not Mexican\".\nOn the other hand, you also have the term \"Spanish\", with which you can refer to a person from any spanish-speaking countries (which are way more than Spain and Mexico)", "This was hilarous, thank you \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5", "We I worked at a pharmaceutical company they had a meeting on diversity and inclusion and the first thing I noted was all the people on the stage were white, I think there was one woman.\nI asked the obvious question and one guy answered well I\u2019m Spanish, European company, he was from Spain, definitely white.\nIt was in the US so maybe they thought we wouldn\u2019t consider him white."]}
