Why did you book him a flight arriving on the day of the wedding without a possibility to sleep? It\u2019s kind of you to pay for him, but you waisted your money by getting a ticket which doesn\u2019t allow him to enjoy the wedding nor for your mom to enjoy his presence.", "YWNBTA if you weren't so resentful. Your brother is a student and he seems to just be asking questions that any reasonable person would ask. He is asking for the *cheapest* place to sleep. It sounds like he is considering both your finances and your mom's wedding. If your intention is to make your mom's wedding special, then focus on that. \n\nI've flown from Asia and the jet lag is horrific, especially if you are going to the west coast. It makes sense to minimize it as much as possible.", "I get your buying the ticket but Yta for having no sympathy for what will absolutely be a shitty trip, especially if he doesn\u2019t even have a night to recover before the event. If you can\u2019t afford more I get that, but your tone here alone makes me think Yta and I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet\u2026 \n\nHonestly if it were me as much as I love my mother I\u2019d just tell her I can\u2019t make it.  \n\nYour post makes it seem that you despise your brother for some reason (not my business) and are using the trip as a way to make sure he knows it.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to actually like your brother? Without further details I\u2019m at a bit of a loss \n\nSounds like you felt obligated/persuaded by family to do this for your student brother. But did the bare minimum and have washed your hands of it.\n\nWhen you realised it would include sleeping over at an airport (some don\u2019t allow this by the way) why didn\u2019t you speak to him and see what he thought? Maybe he/a friend/relative could stump up the additional money for a better flight/capsule hotel?\n\nYou seem to be almost enjoying his discomfort.", "YTA. You offered the flight, then booked the shittest experience and are surprised he's not more grateful?", " YTA - He\u2019s going to end up showing to the wedding exhausted and unable to enjoy the wedding. He won\u2019t be as celebratory nor involved in any of the festivities because he slept on the floor or a rough bench in the airport. Just get him the damn capsule and have him pay you back. This is absolutely a poisoned gift and shows how little you care.", "Firstly I thought n a t or e s h. You see this as a \"choosing beggar\" situation, but for your brother it's more like: \"you're hungry? I've got some leftover pizza I ordered a week ago, If you get rid of black and green spots you should be okay.\" \n\nBut the thing is - he asked rational questions and asked to BORROW money for capsule, and you're reacting as if he spat on your face and insulted you personally. That makes YTA", "Yeah YTA. Him asking for the possibility of a more direct flight was enough for you to basically say fuck off and to just spend the night on the airport bench? Why are you offering to pay if you\u2019re gonna give him shitty conditions and act super whiny? Aren\u2019t you the older brother? \n\nSo let\u2019s get this straight. You pay for a flight where your little brother gets there on the DAY OF the wedding, get mad that he asks for a more direct flight (probably because it\u2019ll be quicker), so you tell him to screw off and sleep on an airport bench? If you don\u2019t have money to spare don\u2019t pay for anything and whine even after you give your bro shitty conditions that he has to deal with. YTA for sure.", "YTA - Yes, you funded the flight, which was a nice thing, but since then, you have actively been rude and showed no care to your sibling since then. \n\nYou can say you aren't able to help further without saying,'You can sleep on an airport bench for all I care'.", "ESH.  \n\nIt's not really practical to fly home from Asia just for a wedding.  With layovers and time differences, you are looking at roughly two days' travel each way.  For a wedding that lasts a few hours, you are going to travel for several days????  That does not compute.\n\nYou offered to buy him a ticket, thinking you were being nice.  But you failed to take into account that the biggest obstacle for him was not money.  It was time.  \n\nHe tries to clue you in, in his own way.  First, he asks about a more direct flight.  Yeah.  Because even without a layover, it's going to be a damn long journey, time-wise.  Then he obviously wonders about where to get sleep during his 9 hour layover.  Sleeping in the airport is not easy, and it's definitely not safe.  In many airports, it's not even allowed.  \n\nYour buying him a cheap ticket is not as helpful as you think it is.  But I can't believe he's willing to travel, even if bro is helping to pick up part of the tab.  \n\nIt would be totally understandable if he stayed in Asia and just sent a card with best wishes.\n\nThere are two ways to approach this issue:\n\n1) (obvious) Little brother stays in Asia.\n\n2)  Little brother gets a pretty direct flight (both ways) and plans to stay in a nice hotel for a few days prior to and after the wedding.\n\nWhich one of those plans does your cheap ticket with the 9 hour layover fit into?", "Is there a reason you didn't speak to him about which flights were available & affordable before booking?\nNo judgement, just not sure I'd be booking anything for anyone without discussing it with them first.\n\nRegardless, I understand that he seems ungrateful for your financial sacrifice, but the practical sacrifice for him is important. You could both be a little more understanding of each others positions, it might be worth a conversation?", "YTA - mostly due to the attitude/approach to your response.  A 9 hour layover is brutal, if you could afford the flight, you can afford to help him get some better sleep.", "NAH", "No you are not. You have been immensely nice to pay for his flight. Even if cheapest option this kind of flights are still expensive.\nI don\u2019t know how much capsules are but can\u2019t he just pay for one?!", "ESH, mildly. He's being a bit ungrateful asking for more after you did something so major, but *asking* also isn't totally unreasonable as long as he accepts your \"no\". You, on the other hand, probably should've checked with him before booking the flight. It's totally reasonable for you to say \"this is the only flight I can pay for\", but he might've wanted to offer to contribute a bit of funds to bump up to the next best flight, or he might've wanted to give up and just stay home. Even if it's unlikely he'd go for either of those, being given the options and asked his opinion would probably make him less upset about the outcome.", "YTA and you absolutely did it on purpose, you\u2019re very resentful", "YTA - A capsule hotel is inexpensive.  He's asking for a very small loan - not even asking for you to pay.\n\nHe's going to arrive exhausted.", "YTA\n\nYou've set your brother up for failure and then act as though you've done him a huge favor.", "YTA\n\nYou may have done a nice thing by booking the flight but you\u2019ve booked him to arrive the DAY of the wedding which is risky due to flight delays etc (why couldn\u2019t you book him to arrive the day before?) and now you\u2019ve stranded him for 9 hours and don\u2019t think you\u2019re obligated to pay for a hotel??? If he\u2019s a student and you\u2019ve already had to pay for the flight how could you not think of making sure he was safe whilst in transit? \n\nWhy can\u2019t other family members help such as your mother? \n\nI think you\u2019re being hard on him and you risk straining the relationship with him", "I've slept on Airport seats before,  I've slept on Greyhound terminals. I've slept on airplanes.\n\nBetter to stay in Asia with a fresh bed and good looking attractions.\n\nSlept depravity is a form of torture, I don't recommend that anyone do this to themselves,  not for a wedding,  not for a surprise wedding.  \n\nNormally weddings takes months to prepare and direct flights and stay overs are more easily managed. \n\nPods are one of the cheapest forms of sleep you can get,  if you can sleep.  \n\nMaybe he should call Mother and maybe she can get him a proper bed. \n\nIt's not your obligation to do this, and yet you are forced into it,  was it your Partners or Mothers idea?\nSeems you have misplaced anger at someone.\n\nI agree with the other posters, you don't seem to like your brother that much, there is resentment there - for whatever reason.  \n\nA little hard on your brother even though you were forced to pay.  Best let the guy stay in Asia.", "Sorry but YTA. Kinda feels like you don\u2019t like your brother and are doing this only not to upset your mother. Your attitude is pretty horrible tbh", "NTA he's young enough to survive a night at the airport, I've done it so many times when I was young. It's a gift, whether he goes on those flights or not, can't make demands when someone is already funding your ticket when they didn't have to", "NTA, I don't understand why other comments say it's a poisoned gift. It's a huge gift ! I think he should be grateful, I personally would have been. Maybe there's some lack of communication, but even in that case it's a very generous gesture. Also, I find a long layover less stressful than a short one, plus it's during the night. Headphones, a sweater as a pillow, an eye mask and he should be fine.", "He kicked a gift horse in the mouth\u2026 NTA. The gift of the flight was a one and done offer. It was accepted. It does not come with extras, meals, Ubers to and fro, snacks and inflight movie entertainment, no overnight accommodations, no champagne. Did he also want to select a window seat in the emergency exit row?! WTH", "NTA. I just took a flight from Asia back to the states and I had to spend 18 hours OUTSIDE of security. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. I found an outlet, plugged my phone in and slept on a bench. I then slept probably 12 of my remaining 30 travel hours. This is like the 3rd time in the last 18 months I\u2019ve had to do this. Yeah would I rather not have had to spend that much time in the airport? Sure, did it kill me? No. But convenience is usually the cost of a free flight.", "NTA you spoke to him and asked what day he could leave and got the flight in your price range and made sure he had hours before the wedding after landing to rest so both the kids could be there for their mother you where already doing something for him because he couldn't afford it himself and he's asked for more you have every right to say no and who ever is siding with him can pay for his bed or can stop", "NTA -- Him being ungrateful and unable to solve basic travel details does leave a sour taste and burn in the stomach. At 22 he can charge these expenses or find other support to foot the bill. \n\nYour brother had limited travel availability and he approved the ticket before you paid. His continual asks implies he has not applied critical thinking to traveling and expects others to solve where and how he sleeps, etc. Tapping you for cash you don't have is unacceptable and implying the arrangements are not to his liking is his doing; not yours.", "YTA. You offered your younger brother a flight and are bitter about it. How much could a capsule pod be? Fifty bucks? Just give him the money and quit being punitive. He can't sleep on a bench. There may not even be a bench available. Nine hours is a complete night!", "NTA if he has the money to study overseas he can pay for the airport hotel himself. Aside from this he\u2019s away for one semester, it wasn\u2019t great to go when the wedding was arranged or could your mum have foreseen this issue and got married on another date?", "Hes just asking.", "NTA he knew what you were booking beforehand. The least he could do is pay for his own hotel.  There is only so much you can afford", "YTA - it\u2019s obvious you didn\u2019t want to pay for the flight so shouldn\u2019t have done it. Getting annoyed with him for asking reasonable questions. What you expect him to do with a 9 hour layover? Especially when he has a wedding once he lands.", "It kinda sounds like you legitimately hate your brother and are only paying for this flight because someone else guilted you in to it.", "NTA. He\u2019s 22 and he can sleep on a bench in the airport, it\u2019s really not that bad. I\u2019ve done worse regularly from ages 16-19. \n\nWhen I first started working and couldn\u2019t afford to fly home for the holidays, my dad paid and booked my flight so my trip took around 21 hours with an 8 hour overnight layover, landing at 6am just in time for work that day. I said \u201cthank you very much for paying for my flights\u201d.", "How much did you discuss this with him?  Yes he should be thankful but just asking the questions shouldn't cause rage.  Just tell him you can't afford it.    \n\n\nNTA for making him spend the night at the airport.  But maybe still an asshole.", "Gonna go ESH\u2026 Sure he should be grateful that you paid for his flight, but you could\u2019ve communicated and agreed the flight times with him before booking them. Was there not an option to book a day earlier so he can catch up on sleep when he arrives and feel fresh for the wedding?", "www.sleepinginairports.net \nDepending on which airport the layover is at your brother can actually get a decent night sleep on the bench. If it's Singapore then he shouldn't be complaining.", "What's up with these people saying ESH? \n\nOP's brother has a 9 hour layover and OP seems resentful about having to book that flight ticket? \n\nI understand if a financial crunch is making you this resentful, but imagine showing up to a wedding dead tired and jet-lagged. The guy just asked for a loan. Considering the lack of a further context, it seems like you're just assuming he won't pay it back. He's a student bro, it might perhaps take him longer than expected to pay it back. \n\nShow some humanity OP. \n\nYTA", "so the brother could not afford the flight, the OP pays the cheapest flight and the bro needs to pack a sleeping bag and sleep mat.", "YTA, why would you buy this flight for him without telling him what it involves?", "Everyone in this reddit is an ungrateful AH.\nNTA. Lesson learned - don't do anything for your brother from this point or he'll demand more. You've given what you can afford. If your brother really wants to come home, he can make it work.", "Soft YTA because lack of sleep can be a bigger issue for some people more than others. It would have been better to let him know about the layover and price difference between that flight and a more direct one.  My guess is the capsule hotel is cheaper and even if you had consulted him he wouldn\u2019t have wanted to pay the difference.  However he would have been able to understand why you booked that flight rather than a more direct one and been less entitled about it.  \n\nAs far as the hotel- he should be able to cover the cost of it if he feels he can\u2019t snooze on an airport bench - he is getting a free flight and you didn\u2019t have to cover that.", "YTA\n\nIf this is all you can afford you should not have offered to buy the flight. Seriously, what sort of state will he be in for the wedding?  Having him miss a night\u2019s sleep and go to his mother\u2019s wedding the next day is horrific and torturous.", "ESH. \n\nYou mentioned in a comment reply that your brother requested that you book his flight for that day, so you weren\u2019t being a jerk by intentionally booking a cheap flight on the day of the wedding.\n\nYour brother is an AH because he wasn\u2019t grateful that you paid for his flight and because he\u2019s being entitled by expecting you to pay for him to stay at a hotel.\n\nYou\u2019re also an AH, because you didn\u2019t tell him about the layover BEFORE booking the flight. You should\u2019ve let him know about this, so he could figure out a plan.\n\nExpecting your brother to sleep on an airport bench and telling him that you \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d where he ends up sleeping is pretty messed up. \n\nHave you asked your mother if she\u2019s able to help pay for a hotel (or a direct flight)? Do you have any other siblings who may be able to help out?", "Being frugal to a fault myself, I'm inclined to go NTA.  That said...did you discuss how much you're willing to 'donate' to your brother's travels beforehand or did you just book the tickets without any inputs?  You should have, at the very least, told brother I can give you X and there's a flight that can fit the budget but with some strings attached (the layover).  And then let him decide if he's OK with it or if he wants to spend some more of his own money in on the travel costs.", "YTA for making a disingenuous offer. If you can\u2019t provide a reasonable experience then don\u2019t offer in the first place.", "NTA.\n\n9 hours is plenty of time to find a somewhat silent corner on a airport and take a nap. (Luggage in a locker of course). Sleeping on/during the flight is also a option. \nIs it ideal, no not at all but at 22 in general you don't need much.\n\nMaby a other family member can also\npitch in and pay the capsule. \nYou already did your fair share.", "Absolutely NTA as he saw the flight you were booking beforehand so this wasn't a surprise as he gave you 1 day he could travel! To get to family events before I have had to have zero sleep for the 24 hours before, and travelled on hellish 12 hour coach journeys when i had no money. My disabled self showed up and had a good time celebrating because I have the human ability to suck up being a bit tired for a few hours and have some coffees. Even if I was lucky enough for someone to pay me a plane ticket in this economy - I would have been more grateful than OP's brother and figured out the rest myself", "Info: how far in advance is he coming in? Did you do it far enough in advance where he'll have time to recover before the wedding? How does he get funding for school? \n\nThe answer you gave him is a callous answer seeing how a pod generally aren't that expensive compared to other forms of stays. I've booked cheap flights for myself and generally dislike layovers that are longer than 5 hours.\n\nYour brother wants to be comfortable on the way home to see you guys so why did you answer him like he's causing you major financial burden? Why did you ahead and buy the tickets if you didn't want to do it? \n\nThe other side is, I know sometimes we get really stressed out and say things we don't mean but it did come off sounding like this wasn't what you wanted to do. It's okay if you didn't but it could have been better communicated.", "YTA.", "YTA.  You offered to pay and he just asked some questions.  What's with the attitude?", "ESH", "I mean, I get it if you feel your brother should be more appreciative, but if you booked this flight for me, I literally couldn\u2019t take it. I travel on the cheap as much as possible. For most of my adult life, I had no choice, but to take the cheapest option. But there\u2019s no chance I could ever get any sleep on an airport bench overnight and it would take me several days to recover. \n\nIt would even take me a long time to recover from this flight overall. \n\nIf the purpose is for your brother to be present at the wedding, this flight isn\u2019t going to achieve that.\n\nSo maybe instead of the reading your brother for communicating his needs, you could work with him together to find a solution.

When I was in school there is no way I could have afforded a hotel room of any price.", "IDK. To me, it sounds like he wasn\u2019t going to go to the wedding but OP decided he should so bought a ticket. When I was in college there\u2019s no way I would have been able to afford a hotel room at any price. And, OP said in his edit that he can afford to cover the hotel, he just doesn\u2019t want to. Which is fine but to me, makes him an AH.", ">Realistically though, he's a college student from a wealthy first world country who is able to afford a study abroad programme. He could probably scrape together the $50 if he really wanted to.\n\nHe's a 22 year old student on a semester abroad.  Scraping money together in that situation is usually asking family for a loan, which he did.", "Maybe I didn't properly word my comment but I was trying to point out that sleeping on a bench is much worse than a minor inconvenience, like the dude that I responded to said.", "I'm from Aotearoa (NZ), so everywhere you fly is a million miles away, and I'd be bloody unhappy if someone booked this for me without discussion. I'd take it if it was legitimately the only option, which is possible, but having \"oh yeah, sleep in the airport\" sprung on you *blows*.", "This is more about the price OP was willing/able to pay vs availability of short layovers. I just finished a vacation from Thailand. To return to the USA (east coast) it was a short flight from Thailand to Singapore, a <2 hr layover and 18hr flight to the east coast. There are shorter layovers to be had if the cost aren't prohibitive.", "Exactly!", "At 22 i could endure a nine hour layover or a free ride with a semi or anything to cut the price of traveling. At 40 I aint coming in that wedding if them are the arrangements.", "Yeah it\u2019s possible but it\u2019s not guaranteed. Seems like if I have specific travel dates I\u2019m screwed no matter what.", "Ewr. Ewe. Enough said.", "Yeah, if you hate your mother. But the rest of us are normal and don\u2019t", "Obviously, it depends on the institution, but spending a semester abroad, I wonder if this is less, \"My professor won't let me take my exam early,\" and more \"I want to see the Great Wall.\"\n\nWe all make choices in life, and it's tough to figure out who the AH is here without more details about OP's brother and OP's mother and why it isn't a no-brainer to be at the wedding, even if it means some hardship for OP's brother.", "Some people don\u2019t sleep well on planes you know", "The post says 'offered to pay for his flight', so I assumed there had been a conversation and the brother agreed, but I could be wrong.", "Fair enough, maybe the op is being a little harsh in his reaction to that bit. I think saying no to the loan is ok, as op has already done a lot and shouldn't have to sort out everything, but maybe op is being a bit disproportionately annoyed about the situation.", "Got it\u2014sorry! I should have read the end of your comment more carefully.", "Right, but these are 20 somethings.   Price is always an integral part of the equation.", "There are shorter layovers to be found if you have flexibility around your travel times, which OP's brother either does not have, or chose not to have.  Sometimes leaving just a day earlier can make all the difference.  OP's brother appears to be completely oblivious.", "the most I've paid is 500 round when I needed a specific date (non holiday) I'm actually flying our Tuesday night for that price point  on a non negotiable date", "Sure. I can see it going this way: \u201cI\u2019m not going, I can\u2019t afford it\u201d\nOP: \u201cyou have to go to your own mother\u2019s wedding\u201d\nBrother: \u201cNo, I can\u2019t\u201d\nOP: \u201cI\u2019ll pay for the ticket\u201d\nThat\u2019s how it would go in my family\u2014the guilt is strong in our lives \ud83d\ude00. My siblings would absolutely guilt the others into doing what they wanted us to do and then be shitty about it later. Because we\u2019re all assholes. \nBut, it is true, we really don\u2019t know what really happened in the original post.", "I'm guessing mom dumped the task of getting bro there, so op might not be operating from a place of \"I want my brother here and enjoying the wedding\" but rather \"ffs mom asked me to get bro here, I booked a flight and he's not happy???\". Not giving a shit about the state of his brother upon arrival, just fulfilling the task given to him.\n\nIt's also kinda weird... the wedding is during his semester abroad, bro didn't have his own plans to make it back and they're booking the flight during the semester.  I wonder if the wedding was short notice.  Or if bro had made it clear he'd have to find out his schedule when he got over there, only to find out he had essentially no time.", "True", "You keep debating a point with wrong information.   Take the L and move on.", "The OP never said that the younger brother approved a specific flight, only that he accepted his older brother\u2019s offer of paying for a plane ticket. The younger brother was dissatisfied with the choice of flights after they were purchased. From my point of view it\u2019s just a lack of communication before the purchase The older brother assumed that his younger brother would be OK with him being frugal with the plane ticket. I could speculate that 22yo doesn\u2019t really want to attend the wedding.", "OP has said that he showed his brother the flight info before booking the tickets in subsequent comments.", "Whoops, I got confused with another post"]}
