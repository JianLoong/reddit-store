Today we were meant to go to the beach so we went to my house with my other friend (14 female) to charge my phone. Mike lives in a different area but he knows his way around here. I asked him in advance to not swear and please be polite. As soon as he stepped in my house he was being very rude, he didn't say hello to my mum when she said hi and he didn't take his shoes off when I asked and he stomped up the stairs and went into my room. I wasn't really mad at this point but then he screamed \"I need a piss\" and went straight into my bathroom and peed with the door wide open and he was moaning and swearing. I yelled at him to close the door because we were all disgusted. He then proceeded to search my room and look around and u plug my plugs and plug his own things in without asking. I was very upset at this point and my friend noticed it and I knew I was going to be In trouble for what he was doing. We left my house and went to the beach where I left him because i was also mad that he said he was mad at me for \"ignoring him\" I left and now some of my friends are calling me the ah and that I shouldn't be so uptight. I haven't talked to him since I left the beach. I am the ah?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I was 14 and a friend behaved like this in my family's home? My parents would be howling: NO MORE MIKE. HE IS RUDE AND WE WON'T TOLERATE THAT NASTINESS IN OUR HOME! BLAH! BLAH! BLAH!\n\nomg. They would lose teh last vestiges of their sanity over something like this and they would flat out tell me that Mike was never coming back to their house. Ever. Ever. \ud83e\udd23\n\nYou pulled stunt of your own on Mike in retaliation - but its not like I have any sympathy for him.\n\nAll I'm wondering now is why you didn't kick his pathetic little azz out of your parents home before leaving?\n\nNTA. Skip Mike and tell your friends that when Mike comes over to *their* homes acting like a beast and getting them in trouble with *their* parents - you will be happy to consider *their* views. \n\nThere is no majority rule about leaving me open to getting verbally thrashed by my parents. Heck no. \ud83e\udd23", ">I asked him in advance to not swear and please be polite.

If normally he's nothing like this, then he has a drug problem or a mental condition, if he is, why did you invite him into your home?", "NTA. Wtf is this guy 12? You blatantly asked him \u201cHey, in MY house could you please be kind and not swear in front of my parents? Seems simple enough. But the dude literally disrespected everyone in the house including you. And going to the bathroom with the door open and swearing? At this point he\u2019s taunting you or something. If he\u2019s not then he needs to grow up and learn some fuckin guest etiquette. Then he gets all petty and says your ignoring him at the beach? Like yeah, i would be pretty fuckin annoyed if someone blatantly disrespected and ignored my ONE request of being in my house. What a asshole. He owes you and your family one pint sized apology, also your friends need to hear your side of the story, and if they still agree with Mike, they are just blatantly ignorant as well.", "nta", "NTA. You\u2019re all good. Forget that shit bag. Proud of you for sticking up for yourself! I wish I would have done more that at your age.", "If you were my kid I'd be proud of you for standing your ground and not accepting this BS behaviour. NTA.", "You have standards and you rightfully recognised when someone was acting like a rabid dog. \n\nYou don't barge into someone's house, not address their parents, swear and proceed to urinate and moan with the doors open. What the hell. That puts you in an uncomfortable position (any parent would question you on your choice of company) and it's just hectic and weird.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. His lack of friendships is not your issue to manage - he has no friends because he can't conduct himself properly.", "yes this! and it would have certainly been okay to ask him to leave the house before the beach trip had even started.", "I can hear my mom yowling for years about a friend of mine coming over and pulling this crap.

You gave him a chance, and he blew it. In fact, it seems like he could have been testing you to see what you willing to put up with.", "He\u2019s not a friend. He\u2019s done that dominance thing where he showed you that he can totally disrespect you by pissing with the door open and unplugging your things; ask anyone who defends you what THEIR parents would say if he behaved like that in their homes. \n\nIf anyone needs to make amends, it\u2019s not you.", "I think maybe start by saying you need some space, and clearly state how his actions are making you question your friendship with him. From there, take a break and distance yourself a bit. If he clearly does not seem to be making any changes to his behaviour, then stop being his friend. \n\nThis way you are clearly setting a boundary and not just ghosting him. Let him know how his actions are affecting your friendship. This puts the ball in his court, and allows him to see how his behaviour might be impacting others. If he remains in denial and clearly sees no point in changing, then you know continuing a friendship with him will have the same result as this post. \n\nI think it\u2019s important to keep a distance with him after this so you\u2019re able to re-evaluate how this friendship is impacting you too. Hope that helps.", "You are not rehab for poorly behaved boys. He\u2019s not a real friend. Block him and conserve your energy for people who lift up your life.", "He's never been over mine before and I haven't been over his, also I've never actually seen this side of him before because he's usually polite whenever we hang out and I don't think I am because the friend I was with also said that he was being really gross and agreed with me", "you should definitely read the comment right above yours", "Dude, you have to leave. You can't be up in here acting like a fool. Beat it. I can't deal with your snit right now. So, go home.", "oh stop it. this is social media. you can't police people's language", "I just had to ask if it was embellished in any way. He\u2019s seriously not someone you want to associate with if he thinks it\u2019s okay to start acting like that. In someone else\u2019s home. Especially after being asked not to. NTA"]}
