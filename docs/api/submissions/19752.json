I had some family stuff, so I had them take my car so they could come later on for food. I'm about to visit them and they've said they'd let us borrow one of their cars so we could do our own thing in the area if we wanted to while we're staying with them.

With this price hike however comes a great advancement in technology.

This friend makes way more money then I do and it\u2019s nothing for her to pay the rental price for a weekend. If she was truly in a bad financial position, I may would help.. but that is not the case here", "I agree that asking to borrow a car in general isn't AH behavior, but I think the situation makes it an unusual ask. Adding 400 miles to your trip to avoid renting a car makes me think Friend is trying to take advantage of OP, by having him cover the costs and risks of her driving.\n\nMaybe OP and Friend have some previous pattern of borrowing each other's vehicles for long trips, that would make the ask less weird for me.\n\nIf OP trusts friend to pay for OP's rental if their vehicle needs repairs (in addition to paying for the repairs of course), that could be a condition for the loan. It sounds like OP doesn't think they need their vehicle for the weekend, and Friend would share the risk. OP is still doing a huge favor for friend, and OP is still NTA if they don't want to offer this. I think it just makes the ask much more reasonable", "Exactly!

I also got rear ended and it took me months to get the bumper replaced.", "NTA.  They can rent a car or he can drive his car to Dallas and rent a long term parking spot.  \n\nIt's unreasonable for him to expect you to let him borrow your car to drive 200 miles one way to house shop, cruise around Dallas checking out homes and neighborhoods,  and then driving 200 miles back to Austin.  \n\nThere is also wear and tear on your vehicle for at least 500 miles.  \n\nWhat happens if there's an accident?
