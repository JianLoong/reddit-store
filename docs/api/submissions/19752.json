Then they can afford the rental..\n\nWould you be willing to drive them out to Dallas? It's fine to say \"i've got obligations that weekend and need to have the vehicle here\".

For one thing, generally Dallas is a cheaper airport to fly into than Austin anyways so I wonder if the money (and time) they could save flying into Dallas instead of Austin might partially make up for a car rental. Also there are apps out there like turo where you can rent an individual persons car for like $30 a day or something which is generally cheaper than rental companies. If something happened I\u2019m not even sure you\u2019d be covered if that persons not on your insurance as an approved driver (i could be wrong about this). way too risky, just try to gently point them in other directions but act like you\u2019re doing it for their own convenience.", "NTA\n\nIf you wouldn't ask to borrow someone else's car, don't let someone else borrow yours.", "  NTA if you feel like you would be asking for trouble, trust your gut and don\u2019t do it!", "NTA.

Friend possibly has a driving record that prevents them from renting a vehicle. There's a reason why they can't rent vehicles, and that's the same reason you should stand behind in your decision. \n\nI only assume this because money isn't a problem to them. They probably have a criminal driving history.", "Tell them your insurance doesn't cover other drivers.", "NAH.  \n\n\nWhile it's reasonable to be attached to your car, your primary means of transportation and an expensive (and presumably nice) thing, it's also reasonable for your friend to ask.

Not anything of distance. But I don't think I'd ever have someone just assume they could take my car.\n\nFor example, I had friends visit from Sweden a few years ago. I had some family stuff, so I had them take my car so they could come later on for food. I'm about to visit them and they've said they'd let us borrow one of their cars so we could do our own thing in the area if we wanted to while we're staying with them.

You'd have to be out of your mind. \n\nYou're absolutely right to be confused and appalled that they would even ask. It's an incredibly nervy thing to ask for you to take that risk when they can just rent a car.", "NTA. But also if you\u2019re concerned about looking like a bit cold toward your friend (as I know I would) just blame it on your insurance.

And it probably won't. She can rent a car.", "Austin to Dallas is 200 miles. At a non-fuel cost of about 0.50 / mile (per AAA) you're out $200 plus local costs of house hunting. Enterprise is about $60 per day on the area. Sure, they're saving $, because it's being dumped on you.

And nope, I would not be lending my car to anyone. No is a complete sentence and doesn't require an explanation. If your friendship can't withstand a No, then it never was a friendship.", "NTA. Never lend your vehicle. If she has an accident you could be liable. If someone dies, you are now involved in vehicular manslaughter. Then there's the friends whose licenses have been suspended. They drive your car and you are in for a lot of trouble. Oh, the parking tickets! They don't pay, and you get the big surprise when you get the overdue notice with late fees attached. A car is too valuable, and there are too many possible problems. Just say no, I never lend my car to anyone except my spouse. If they try to argue, just remind them that you already made a decision about this.", "NTA \nYou have plans that require you to have your car. Those plans are to know where that car is and to have control of said car.", "Why did they assume they could take your car?  Why not just fly into Dallas and rent a car? Can be that much to rent a car.  We paid 23.00 a day, when the kids car was totaled  NTA", "Right! She also said she would need to stay with me a for a few days which is fine but to ask to borrow my car.. idk. Just seems like mooching.", "Right?! Me and my husband visit friends a lot and we always just rent a car. It doesn\u2019t even cross our minds to ask to borrow a car. I would feel terrible I drove a friends car and it got messed up. I would rather just pay for a rental.", "Cars, their maintenance, and repairs all used to be much less expensive when car culture was first being developed. My grandfather got his first truck for $200 brand new, whereas the first car I bought was $21k and already had 20k miles on it. Inflation doesn't quite cover that gap. With this price hike however comes a great advancement in technology. While the truck my grandpap had was likely top of the line at the time, my sports class likely had better comfort, safety, and performance.", "it's a reasonable request. It'd be unreasonable to have a negative response to a denial.", "It\u2019s not going to ruin the friendship, but they are gonna tell me I\u2019m selfish and be mad about for a few weeks most likely and I will have to hear how I\u2019m being \u201cinconsiderate\u201d. Then they will get over it.", "It would run our friendship if she wrecked my 50k vehicle ! She has a history of bad driving.", "Right but they want to stay at my house so they don\u2019t have to pay for hotels.", "My friend didn\u2019t even ask. She said \u201cwe were going to fly into Austin so we could crash at yours and then use your truck\u201d lol.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m annoyed they are trying to save money instead of just pay a couple hundred bucks for a rental.", "Agreed. This friend makes way more money then I do and it\u2019s nothing for her to pay the rental price for a weekend. If she was truly in a bad financial position, I may would help.. but that is not the case here", "I agree that asking to borrow a car in general isn't AH behavior, but I think the situation makes it an unusual ask. Adding 400 miles to your trip to avoid renting a car makes me think Friend is trying to take advantage of OP, by having him cover the costs and risks of her driving.\n\nMaybe OP and Friend have some previous pattern of borrowing each other's vehicles for long trips, that would make the ask less weird for me.\n\nIf OP trusts friend to pay for OP's rental if their vehicle needs repairs (in addition to paying for the repairs of course), that could be a condition for the loan. It sounds like OP doesn't think they need their vehicle for the weekend, and Friend would share the risk. OP is still doing a huge favor for friend, and OP is still NTA if they don't want to offer this. I think it just makes the ask much more reasonable", "Exactly! If she was staying with me and wanted to take it down the street to yoga or to grab lunch, that\u2019s ok but driving it hours away for a whole weekend.. nah.", "Inviting herself to stay with you doesn't sound fine to me. Did she ask you if she could, or just say she was like it was a done deal?\n\nI would not take kindly to anyone inviting themselves to stay with me and THEN demanding use of my car on top of it. Just, no.", "Why isn\u2019t she just flying into Dallas, since that\u2019s where she wants to be? Or is this a free hotel, free car situation?", "My husband came up with the rule years ago that the only people that can borrow our vehicles are ones that can write a check to buy a new one for cash as a replacement if something goes wrong. If insurance eventually pays they get their $$ back. This goes for trailers and jet skis as well. \nThe # of folks that can borrow our vehicles is a very small group + our adult children now.", "I don't think it's a reasonable request at all", "If they are going to be a baby, then they can stay somewhere else when they come in town.  Seriously.", ">they are gonna tell me I\u2019m selfish and be mad about for a few weeks\n\nI hope there's more to the friendship than you providing your car and free accommodation", "If she get mad at you for saying no, then she also won't stay at your place - double win for you ;)", "Is your friend going to be covered for driving your car? If not and something happens, you might have to foot the cost of repair or replacement. You should check your auto policy. \n\nNTA.", "Wow, so she wants to drive your luxury vehicle too!  Again, NTA.", "You say they want to look for houses over the weekend, so were they planning on multiple trips to Dallas from Austin over that weekend?  It's 400 miles round trip, not counting on the house hunting mileage.  \n\nThat is INSANE.", "Sister, GTFO! What are you going to do?!?!", "Then tell her absolutely not since it's already promised to someone else.  No is a complete sentence.", "some insurance works that it based on the driver, so if you get in an accident and another person is driving they dont cover it.  Other insurance covers the car and will cover it no matter who drives.  You should find out which kind you have just to be safe for the future.", "Yeah it's far too much.", "She's sounding kinda entitled. Tell her your insurance won't cover her driving your car. NTA", "Still not worth it. Took me 4 months to get my car fixed because of one single part.  Neither the friend nor insurance is paying for all that time lost.", "That is my main concern too. I have a Ford f150 and when someone broke Into my vehicle, it took months to get the door handle and other part needed that was broken. I also got rear ended and it took me months to get the bumper replaced."]}
