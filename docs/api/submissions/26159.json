I explained that was absolutely unnecessary and it makes me uncomfortable due to the fact that my mom did that for my sister and it didn\u2019t exactly end well. So I didn\u2019t want that to happen with her. Fast forward, she retires. Assumes she is watching him full time. I have a flexible enough job, so in no way was she ever going to watch him full time. Max 1-2 days a week. She immediately gets upset. She watches him 1-2 days a week for 3 months. In that time, I\u2019ve caught her asleep with him in her arms, she doesn\u2019t follow my feeding schedule, does not put him down in the crib for naps, always suggests putting rice cereal in his bottles, always gives unsafe advice (SIDS risks), constantly has to change the days she watches him and reschedules because she is out of town or something else comes up and the final straw -she gave my son COVID because she didn\u2019t think she was contagious. My husband doesn\u2019t have the best communication relationship with her and frankly doesn\u2019t ever stand up for himself or my son to her to tell her the rules in which we want our son to be watched.

She can\u2019t be trusted with him and has proven that to me. I feel that she doesn\u2019t respect my husband and I as parents and think that because she is my husbands mom, she knows best. Every time she watches my son,  my husband and I have the worst sleep -because she holds my son all day. My husband has not told her the truth about why we took away watching our son. Should I tell her the truth? I just never want her to watch him again and maybe honesty is the right thing to do but will absolutely hurt her feelings.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This makes it less likely that she will try to play you two off each other.", "NTA.

Think of it this way, what kinds of things has she done that you HAVEN\u2019T caught? Cut. Her. Off. And when she boo hoos and asks why, tell her exactly why.

He needs to face the fact that if your child was injured in her care you'd never forgive yourselves having known the risk and accepted it.", "You have a serious husband problem.\n\nWhat you're going to do about it, I don't know.\n\nBut I'll bet that he takes the baby over to her house behind your back.", "I apologize for my harshness. I had a mil once that thought she could do whatever when it came to my kids. I reminded her I kept my kids from my own parents for a whole year (long story) so what made her think she\u2019s immune. Anyway, you can do this. Just think of your son\u2019s safety first and her blatant disrespect to you and your rules second. Hopefully she\u2019ll realize you mean business and learn from her mistakes.", "Yes, would never forgive myself or him."]}
