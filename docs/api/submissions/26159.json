He is supposed to put you and his children ahead of his mom.", "If he is, he is, nothing tops protecting your child and that includes annoyed husbands, that's his failing not yours. If he gets mad at you keep repeating that.", "My MIL walks all over my husband and it drives me NUTS. Tbh this may not be the tactful approach, but after a while I just started pointing it out loudly, in real time, every time she would overstep at family gatherings. Turns out nobody was blind to it and it ended up being a bit of a relief to just put it on the table. She used to be very critical of me, which has also changed since then! People like our MILs can dish it out but absolutely can\u2019t take it.

Maybe I'm imagining it wrong.", "her husband survived with no back bone and a door mat mentality.  this means that she's bulldozed and bullied him his entire life the way she's doing to his wife. \n\nnah, don't humor the crazy MIL. idiots that don't listen won't listen to professions either, the covid pandemic was proof of that. low contact.", "I would be careful with this \"have her ask a dr\" idea. First, she might not have a dr who is up to date on things--her dr is likely not a pediatrician, for example. Second, sometimes people hear what they want to hear. A dr saying \"Well, even though the risk is low, it's not a great idea to do that\" or \"The cautious thing to do is...\" can be interpreted or distorted into \"my dr said the risk is low\" and \"he said that's not necessary.\" Either way, you don't want to bring in the idea that what someone else has to say is more important than what you have to say, like her dr gets a veto over you or something. Then you just have more work to do to get her to listen to you.\n\nAlso, yeah her husband survived but that's beside the point. She's the parent and her decisions are based on sound reasons.
