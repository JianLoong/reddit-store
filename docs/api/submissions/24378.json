She then told me it's vegan and I asked are you sure, to which she reassured me that it is in fact vegan. For what it's worth, the ice cream was one of those Japanese Mochi green tea ice creams.

She even pretended to come out to me as lesbian and then laughed at me for believing her. \n\nSo, when I realized she had lied to me to get me to eat real ice cream, I lost me shit.

My description makes it sound kinda tame but I was actually shouting at some point and aggressively pointing my finger at her.\n\nShe then went to the owner of the store and cried.

She gave me ice cream that she swore was vegan, because I reminded her that I\u2019m lactose intolerant.  I\u2019m going to be ill and stuck in the bathroom for hours.  This was deliberate and malicious.\u201d  And your boss should have fired her for that, because it is going so far beyond the pale.  It may even be a form of assault or battery in your area, so you may be able to press charges if you want.\n\nI generally come down pretty hard on people for flying into a rage, but\u2026she deliberately hurt you, physically, and you limited yourself to yelling.  Sure, yelling isn\u2019t 100% ideal, but nobody responds ideally to being injured.", "NTA. She caused you physical harm by her \u201cprank\u201d. File an official complaint with your employer.", "NTA. Please report this colleague. She is endangering your health and damaging the business. As a customer, I would not frequent an establishment where staff members took pleasure in potentially harmful misinformation.", "NTA. And tbh, I'd go to management about this. \"The pranking is one thing. But she's harassing me and it's not only affecting my ability to work, it's affecting my health. She POISONED ME, knowing full well that I can't have dairy and she lied to my face and told me it wasn't.\" Report her. This is the same as fucking with someone's food. I know it's not an allergy, but it's causing you pain and it's genetic and a medical condition you can't do anything about, other than avoid the food you can't intake. She knew that. And this 'habit' of hers should rightly get her fired. Screw her.", "NTA- sensitive tummy person here and a vegetarian - I would scorch earth over this. Report her asap!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReport her to HR, and take another PTO for health reason, citing them knowingly giving you food that would hurt you as the reason. Do it in writing.", "NTA - You should report her to HR for creating a hostile work environment with her lies, endangering your health, and affecting company productivity by not being available to work while your body was working through the ice cream.", "NTA \n\nAlthough you may have not responded the best in the case of the business and how your boss may see it the point still stands you don't fuck with peoples food report her to the owner for this - her antics are likely causing hinderance to the business\n\nIf I were in the owners shoes and they came running to em crying about it, I would be disappointed that this altercation happened in front of customers *but* and this is a big but - fucking with staff resulting in them being unable to work their shifts or the consistent fucking with both employees and the business she is causing would absolutely be my main problem here not with you\n\nBe clear when talking to the owner here about what's been going on not only with you in this incident but what they have been doing to others in the past because sure as shit the words they had with the owner will be heavily sugar coated and bias", "NTA. \nAs someone who is also lactose intolerant I understand you completely. It's also dangerous, it can lead to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance which could land you in the ER. \nIIRC you can sue someone for doing something like this no? But I'd suggest you talk to the owner and call in sick if you need to. She deserved the shouting at, too. Nobody should toy with someone's health like that.", "NTA. I\u2019d take it a step further and report her to HR. What she did was NOT okay.", "She tried to poison you.  She triggered a bodily illness. She lied and manipulated .  I personally would threaten legal against her and who ever condones what she did.", "NTA. You should never yell at a coworker, but her ongoing unprofessionalism culminating in what is most likely a *crime* is justification enough for me.\n\nWhat she did is food tampering. That is a crime. She *knowingly* fed you something that she knew would make you sick. If you fed her meat that would be food tampering too. It doesn't have to be *poison*, it just has to be something the person can't/won't eat. Use this knowledge wisely.", "NTA. I think it's a borderline E SH because yelling at someone in a workplace is never great, but since she basically just poisoned you, I think you can be given some latitude. Your bosses are also AHs because this woman sounds unhinged, and her \"jokes\" should have been reigned in before now.", "Time to put in an official complaint about this.  And unfortunately, lesson learnt with not accepting any food from any co-workers.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand all the people who say shouting at someone is (almost always) unacceptable, or expect people to never ever lose their temper - WTH? You were absolutely, 100%, completely right to scream in her face. She deserves it, and she needed a good screaming at. \n\nAnd go to your manager/HR. And press charges. And take the following day off as a sick day to recover.", "NTA. Food allergies/intolerances can have debilitating effects on people.\n\nI am insulin resistant. I have a low enough A1c that I'm not considered diabetic, so I have no medication to help. If someone were to pretend (i.e. lie) that a food was safe for me, I may end up in the emergency room being treated for ketoacidosis.  \n\nFreak out for sure.", "Sadly YTA to yourself. This happened on your workplace. You should have gonne straight to HR, not trying to deal with it yourself in your anger.

It's unprofessional, no matter how justified your anger is and how much she deserved it (and she did, but the customers didn't, nor did the owner). \n\nYOU should have gone to the owner and complain.\n\nNow your position is much worse to defend, because the owner has a very good reason to be unhappy with you both.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
