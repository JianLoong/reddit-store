He apparently didn't believe I was allergic, and didn't like that I'd have to ask others to put pineapple on the pizza when I was working the make table. Another coworker had told me weeks before that he thought I was \"faking it for attention\" for whatever reason, and they thought that was ridiculous. \ud83d\ude44 We had gloves, but I'd had enough experiences where there were tiny holes in the gloves and my hand would be burning and itching for hours. \n\nWhen he was making the pizza, I was counting the money on one of the registers so I called back to him to remind him to please not put pineapple on it. Or at the very least, if he did then let me know so I could make my own. He told me he wasn't going to use it as a topping. When I ate a piece, I thought I noticed a sweetness but thought it was maybe from the sweet onions we used. I was starving at this point, hadn't eaten all shift. I had 2 more pieces in the span of a minute. Then the burning started. It felt like I'd eaten a Carolina reaper whole and washed it down with ghost pepper sauce. I immediately realized something was up, and RAN to the bathroom to puke it up. My face, lips, throat, and stomach burned for hours anyways. Much later on that night I ended up having diarrhea that felt like lava for days afterwards, to the point where I was passing blood and was in tears. \n\nI was fucking pissed, and another coworker had to hold me back before I did something that would have gotten me arrested.

Hm okay, so I went to the district manager (who liked me, and was in once or twice a month to do check ups). I fully explained the situation, and said it's me or him.

From your description, there was nothing that would even make her think it was vegan, so she obviously just straight up lied.", "NTA.  How was the employment not terminated?", "If someone deliberately fed you poison, there'd be legal ramifications. Could you try to level an assault charge at her? I'd be contacting HR and speaking to police or a lawyer.", "Definitely make sure to give details to your boss. S/He should fire her just for what she did to you personally, but the fact that she works in a food retail space, having her employed there should scare the crap out oh him/her.  NTA", "She is an arsehole for deliberately giving you something that she knew would make you sick. It's even more concerning that you work with food and she is still not aware that ignoring food allergies is dangerous. I'll have to go with NTA based on the info you provided but you have left out a lot about why you think you may have over reacted. There is the point where you could absolutely be the arsehole. This could absolutely change this to E S H.", "NTA people can cause real serious lasting harm by messing with people's food intolerance. It's not a funny prank and your boss needs to do something about her if it isn't the first time she has tried this sort of thing on coworkers.", "NTA. She purposely made you ill. That is not a prank, do not trust her, definitely report her.", "NTA- your coworker mildly poisoned you for laughs.\n You need to tell the owner that. Her crocodile tears are to get out of trouble.", "NTA, you could\u2019ve just went to the manager and complain about the co-worker\u2019s \u201cprank\u201d. She should\u2019ve known better.", "A friend of mine with a peanut allergy got a restraining order against a coworker that fed them peanut contaminated food as a prank.  Might want to talk to a lawyer.", "**NTA**\n\nWhat kind of sociopath would do something like that?! I hope that you explained the situation to the owner, because that's SO far from being funny or a prank that it's ridiculous.", "Everyone is saying to tell the boss or HR... Can't op go to the police? Isn't this some kind of food tampering/poisoning?", "You should make a formal complaint to your/her supervisor or HR. This is fucked up and I would consider this assault. \n\nNTA", "NTA you could have ended up in hospital.\n\nShe deserves to cry.  She was shouted at for a reason.", "NTA- She's an AH. I'd continue to give her Hell. She thinks doing this is funny.", "NTA and if HR/manager don't fire her, sue her for it. She needs to learn a lesson that \"pranks\" at work are unacceptable.", "NTA, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s illegal, knowingly giving food to someone that they can\u2019t consume? I would be taking it further, it\u2019s not a prank, it\u2019s malicious bodily harm", "Nta!", "NTA but please, please report it. I have family that would leave in an ambulance (or worse) if they were deliberately poisoned.\n\nYears of digestive system problems can cause life changing problems later in life. Its not just 'oh the shits for a few hours, I get that after a curry'", "NTA.\n\nOn the \"bright side,\" it was an intolerance, and not an allergy. But this she's probably going to get someone hurt or even killed if she doesn't check her ego.", "Did she claim this was specifically a prank when confronted?", "nta but be smart about this. you need to report her.", "NTA.  You are lactose intolerant and she deliberately made you sick, as a prank.  When you described the scenario and coworker I was expecting her to be 14 maybe 15 years old. But late 30's? Would it still have been funny if you were allergic to nuts and she intentionally lied and said it was nut free? She should be fired.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think this person should be working around food\u2026 Furthermore none of those are good pranks. They\u2019re either way too small or way too big. She must watch New Girl.", "NTA she poisoned you. Lodge a formal HR complaint. Don't accept anything from her in future.", "NTA- I don't know if your work has an HR but if they're a reaction is called into question you can honestly tell them you were ill and not in full control of of anything, let alone your emotions.\n\nBut she deliberately poisoned you.  I'm not sure what they can say against that.", "NTA.  She essentially poisoned you.  I would be pressing assault charges.  She did it intentionally, knowing it would make you sick.", "NTA\n\nCoworker just poisoned you. I've explained to your boss, or his higher up if he's too good of friends with this coworker, that this person gave you something that knew it would harm you..  \n\nAnd made it a hostile work environment.\n\nIf the boss is any good he's going to fire this person or definitely give them a high grade write up, depending on they're firing protocols\n\nDepending on your location this can be assault. And you could possibly press charges", "NTA but\u2026 by your own admission this coworker is known for lying and pulling pranks on people. Why the fuck would you not triple check that container before eating it? Absolutely the coworker sucks for actively poisoning you but, I\u2019m having a hard time that you just took her at her word given her track record.", "NTA - get it on record at work that she did this. What if she does it to someone with a more severe allergy? Being lactose intolerant sucks (I am too) but her \"prank\" is dangerous and she's a damn adult, she should know better.", "NTA. Is this assault? I feel like this is assault, since she purposely poisoned you. You should call the police and let them sort it out. Let HR or whoever know that you did so.", "ESH. I get that what this person did was malicious and they deserve to be imprisoned for it, but why the hell did you listen? You could have just told them to fuck off.", "NTA. She deserved it. That\u2019s a horrible thing for her to do!", "She should be fired.  Don't mess with people food nta", "NTA, someone intentionally causing you harm like that is horrible. I'd report her to HR especially since she probably is going to report you for yelling at her. You were physically harmed by her 'prank'. Pranks are only funny when both sides can laugh about it. Otherwise it's just someone being a jerk under the facade of it being 'just a joke'.\n\nEdit to add: Someone else mentioned this and I think it would be a good idea. This could potentially count as assault or battery. Possibly some form of food tampering, or harassment at the very least. \n\nEither way I'd look into whether you can press charges against the coworker. That would also give you some extra backing in the event that she files a complaint. You could point to the fact that you've filed charges against her to emphasize the seriousness of what she did because too often people try to downplay this kind of stuff as you just had to go poop a lot so how bad could it be.", "What did she cry for? That she was busted? I swear, she is dramatic as hell", "NTA - That is assault. Forget about the store owner, file charges!", "NTA. That's not a fucking prank. What a child.", "NTA  \nWould she have laughed about giving peanuts to someone with allergies?   \nWould she have cried if someone was \"off duty\" because they had to go to the hospital because of what she did?  \nPlease explain what happened to your boss - if this is a place where you would like to work at, your boss will react to what she did by giving her a warning or plain fire her ass.", "Not.  She purposefully tried to harm you.", "She poisoned you. \n\nYou're lactose intolerant and she gave you lactose. NTA", "As a fellow lactose intolerant.... She should know to always double check... It's a crappy day and a half for too much lactose. I despise when it's not self inflicted or can plan to be at home. I'd tell the boss you being made sick on purpose by the co worker... It makes you less reliable to be running to the loo constantly.", "Yep. This!\n\nNTA", "Hopefully he gets paid for this shift too bc what she did caused him to leave", "By the letter of the law, she likely committed a crime. In practice, cops/DA won't care.", "Don't know how far they'd realistically get with this *but* whenever someone mentions doctoring their food because of office thieves the first comments that show up are always \"wait thay's illegal\". So there must he some merit I suppose.", ">expect people to never ever lose their temper\n\nAnyone can lose their temper. To me the line is how bad the thing was that made someone shout and/or how long they were patient.\n\nIn my opinion, people who say it' never ok, had either a very easy life, are doormats or are the ones bullying other people.", "Only an idiot would classify yelling as worse than purposely poisoning someone.", "Yes will likely 1 ply public toilet paper... Nothing likely awful stinky case of the runs in a  row of cubicles to make you feel alive.", "As someone with severe allergies yes, we should double check. But it actually isn't asking much for people without intolerances or allergies not to actively poison us and there should 1000% be consequences for doing so.", "I mean, yeah, be vigilant about your own safety, but also let's not blame the victim for taking the friend/coworker at her word.\n\nThis is definitely NTA.", "heh heh\n> crappy", "I think companies should be able to pull from malicious people\u2019s PTO and give to the person they purposely made I\u2019ll\ud83e\udd70", "Even if it does, a hostile work environment generally requires a pattern of behavior. From what it seems this is the first and only prank directed at OPs medical issue. \n\nThat's not to say it's not a problem or that HR shouldn't care. In fact, if they do nothing about it and something happens again, OP now has a paper trail that will show they are complicit in allowing it. \n\nSo definitely go to HR.", "Yes it would as ingesting lactose products have a major impact on the digestive system. I am allergic to cow milk, not lactose intolerant...I am willing to deal with the allergic reaction (some Benadryl usually helps) to enjoy sweet treats like ice cream but I work and plan for it. \n If someone lied to me about something containing dairy after I specifically asked, I would be filing a complaint.  Depending on a person's reactions, this can be debilitating for days and could need medical intervention.  And if the person regularly does things like this and management knows this, the company is facing severe liability.", "In Ontario, Canada, you are eligible for  a special diet allowance under the disability support program. \n\nBut besides that, would folks be making an exlax cake, and serving it to coworkers? \n\nProbably not, because they know what would happen.  Just like this coworker knew what would happen. \n\nThis was bordering on criminal, though it is usually not charged as such, even though it is a form of assault.", "Yes. The ADA has expanded their definition of disability to include food allergies/intolerances. So he would be part of a protected class.", "(Not a lawyer) I feel like they could sue in civil court though for lost wages and distress since she basically poisoned him", "So was his. If you are yelling and aggressively pointing at someone, that is considered assault in many jurisdictions.", "Agree", "Exactly. I don't have any allergies, but I have friends who do and before I offer them anything, I always Triple-Check.\n\nThis coworker did this on purpose and should face consequences. NTA, Op, but speak to your manager about this.", "[removed]", "If you have celiac and she gives you gluten, it can kill you. What I'm saying is that he basically poisoned you. I will report him and I will tell every colleague what he did. From your description, there was nothing that would indicate she was vegan, so she obviously lied.", "She caused him actual damage.  His response could be considered self defense."]}
