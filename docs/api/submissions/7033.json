The issue is with communicating with her. The rest of our family operates during the day, and so (obviously) all of our texting and phone calls take place at day time. We don\u2019t call Jen but we do text her. None of us expect a reply straight away, but by her own admission, she wakes up at 5pm and leaves for work at 10pm so she has at least 5 hours to text back. I\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t expect a text back the same day but recently it\u2019s gotten ridiculous. \n\nShe sent a text to the family group chat \u2018setting her boundaries\u2019. It was 1 rule; do not text her during the day. Her \u2018open hours\u2019 are from 3am to 6am. Now, I get those are her awake hours, but she\u2019s in the minority here. There\u2019s 30 people in this group-chat and she\u2019s the only one who operates at those hours. Of course, there will be some outliers, but I\u2019m not staying awake until 3am to shoot her a quick text about if she wants red or green napkins. I\u2019m all for setting and sticking to boundaries, but this is ridiculous. \n\nI sent her a text in November asking her what she wanted for Christmas and her birthday (early Jan) but she didn\u2019t respond. So I didn\u2019t get her anything. I was getting frustrated with Christmas gift fever and burnout and I felt like she was being deliberately irritating. She was leaving all my messages on read. Even ones where I said I can\u2019t wait any longer to wait for her replies so now is her last chance before I skip her. \n\nI should note that I'm not texting her non-stop. I barely text her outside of Christmas and birthday shopping. I don't think it's rude or unreasonable to respond to a text about what you want as a gift in a reasonable time frame. Again, I'm not expecting same-day replies, but if you want something, you answer. I'm not a mind-reader.\n\nChristmas rolled around and everyone seemed to notice that I hadn\u2019t gotten her anything. Jen seemed a little upset but she didn\u2019t tell me, so how would I know? I tried talking to her later about her birthday, but again, she wouldn\u2019t respond. So I did the same thing. \n\nFor her birthday, she simply sent me a link to an online shop, but no links to t-shirts she liked, or anything. I asked her what she wanted, and no response. I didn't get her anything. Her birthday was yesterday and apparently, she's been really upset. Her mum said I should have just gotten her what she asked for and ball-parked sizes. Here's the thing; she didn't send me the links to t-shirts, she sent me the links to whole websites with no indication of what t-shirts she wanted. I even text-searched to check in case I missed it. I asked her what t-shirt she wanted and she left me on read. \n\nI told my aunt this, but she said I need to understand and respect her 'boundaries'. I told her it's unreasonable to expect everyone to operate on her hours when her hours aren't the norm and that's she's being a hypocrite because she also complains about Jen not responding. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673406879, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108twxx/aita_for_not_getting_my_cousin_a_birthday_or/", "score": 452, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were trying to be nice and get her something even though you aren\u2019t obligated and she acted like a shit so she got nothing. Boo hoo. NTA", "NTA\nBoundaries are not you telling people what to do, it's saying, \"This behavior isn't ok with me, if you do it, here are the consequences\".", "The whole POINT of texting is that it's asynchronous. This 3-6 am thing is nonsense.", "NTA. Make your own boundaries. You don't text between 11pm and 7 am.\n\nOr start sending her emails.", "You did respect her", "NTA\n\nDoes she realise that there are two functions on her phone that can help her with her issue? One is the Silent function... the other is the Off button", "The only answer here is to set the exact same boundary. Only text between 9am and 5pm please.", "NTA\n\nBut I am so freaking comfused. It's not like a phone call, where an immediate response is needed (pick up the phone y/n).  She can put the cell on mute and respond later...", "NTA my nephew never responds, never reciprocates birthday wishes, or visits, or gifts. I had to show up at his work last year unannounced to give him his birthday present. We don\u2019t worry about getting him stuff anymore since he clearly doesn\u2019t care enough to answer us.", "NTA\n\nShe's intentionally being difficult and wants others to jump through hoops for her.  She probably is a  professional victim as well.", "NTA", "NTA  \n\n\nShe can't have it both ways, You respected her boundary. She did not respond so you did not accommodate, that's your boundary. \n\nMaybe you should make it an official \"boundary\" that is people don't respond to your questions about going places or gifts you will simply cancel any plans or items and assume they are saying no. \n\nIf you are expected to respect her boundaries and not get upset then so can she.", "That is such a weird rule or boundaries. Just read and/or reply messages when you are awake!  Not everyone can accommodate to her demand. I don't read nor reply messages immediately all the time. We all have a life outisde of our mobile phones please. Just do so when it's convenient . NTA because your cousis is borderline unreasonable. \n\nAs mentioned by others, just get her something. I resort to gift cards if I really can't think of anything to buy as gift.", "NTA But I think you might be misunderstanding what's going on. A 30-person group chat sounds like a absolute nightmare and she probably just leaves notifications off all the time because she doesn't want the constant texts when she's trying to sleep.", "If she's awake between 5p.m. and 10p.m.(normal hours) then she can respond like a normal functioning adult. Sounds like she just wants to be difficult. NTA", "NTA. It's bizarre to expect people not to message you when texts don't have to be synchronous and can be left for people to read and respond to when they're online. Not to mention there's a Do Not Disturb feature and notifications can be silenced. You have already been considerate to ask in advance, and she clearly read your messages without bothering to reply you. Sending website links without context or additional explanation or even a few words of gratitude also seems just plain rude.", "NTA How about you text Jen at 11am and she has her phone on \u201cdo not disturb\u201d. Then she receives the text at 3am and texts you back. Your phone is on \u201cdo not disturb\u201d so you receive the text at 9am and respond. Eventually there will be a conversation. Jen needs to learn how to use technology.", "NTA phones have this thing called do not disturb mode which can be set as a schedule so notifications don't go off while you sleep.its unreasonable to expect everyone to wake up between 3am and 6am just to text her", "NTA. The whole point of texting her is so she doesn't have to reply immediately and can reply when she's awake and has time. It's absolutely ridiculous to demand people with regular 9-5/day shift lives get up at 3am to send a text. She may as well have said blanket \"don't text me ever\". I understand feeling left out, but refusing to accept a totally reasonable compromise and demanding everyone else shifts their lives to her schedule is wild. She can't refuse to communicate then be angry that you didn't read her mind.", "Have the go with the unpopular opinion here ETA.\n\nEven without being told what to buy you could've gotten something if she didn't like it that's on her you gave more than ample time to respond. IMO you shouldn't even have bother asking about her birthday and just expected to not to get a reply and just grabbed something at random.\n\nI've worked night shift, I've gotten texts while I was asleep if it bothered me I muted the chat simple as that. Limiting texts to a three hour period is absurd especially when the time frame is 10 hours after she's woken up.\n\nJust out of curiosity how often does she text other people not  during their \"open hours\"? If she expects everyone to work around her schedule she should be expected to do the same for everyone else.", "NTA. She\u2019s not setting a boundary for herself (e.g \u201cI will only ANSWER texts between 3 - 6am\u201d). She\u2019s making rules for everyone else (e.g \u201cYou will only SEND me texts between 3 - 6am\u201d). You are completely free to ignore her rule and not give in to her attempts to control you in such a fashion.", "I'm a night shift worker. I just keep my phone on silent, wake up, respond to whatever I may have recieved and get on with getting ready for work.\n\nIts.. its not complicated. Like, at all. \n\nNTA Jen's wierd.", "She might be on call for work, and she needs to keep the alerts on, but can turn them off for certain groups/people.  That said, she needs to work harder on responding to messages.", "My understanding is that a boundary is something the person making the boundary does, not a rule imposed on others. So a reasonable boundary would be \"If you text me outside of 3-6am, I'm going to be less likely to answer.\" (which tbf, is still a dumb boundary to set IMO) And OP's boundary would be \"If you don't respond to my texts, then I won't get you a gift\" \n\nIt's supposed to be about your reaction, not the other person's action.", "Yeah. Your cousin is just unreasonable. I live in a completely different time zone from most of my extended family. We have a huge family group chat that\u2019s mainly active at the time I\u2019m asleep. And I just mute my phone. It\u2019s not that hard.", "NTA, ask them to duck off. Respecting her boundaries doesn't mean you suddenly turn a mind-reader and figure out which t-shirt she wants from an entire website.", "Maybe, but she's also upset about not having a birthday presp clearly it's not just about dumb stuff.", "Noon and 3pm. Why give a larger window?", "You may now text me between 3:27pm-6:04", "Just remembered seeing on some apps they allow you to set a delivery time, so you could set all messages to cousin to come in at 3am", "Fuck that. She can\u2019t return a simple message she gets nothing. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers and gifts aren\u2019t promised", "Its always cute when a NPC tries to be the main character, NTA. Well handled i might add.", "Nta it\u2019s not understanding or caring about her boundaries, it\u2019s lack of communication. Sure she doesn\u2019t want people texting her outside those hours but why can\u2019t she just reply during those hours. I use to work nights before I had kids and I would wake up have my coffee watch the news and reply to everyone, go to work, get home around 7am and usually reply to the early risers. It\u2019s part of adulthood", "NTA\n\nAll in favor of boundaries, but this is ridiculous. \n\ntexts are a-sync communication method specifically for not interrupting people. \n\nAll she has to do is mute her phone, and answer whenever", "ESH\n\n\nI don\u2019t get why adults continue required gift giving. I give my niece and nephew gifts because they\u2019re children.", "NTA\nNo one is owed presents, ever.", "ESH.\n\nHer demand that you only write her between 3 and 6 AM is stupid, especially since alerts are easy to mute/ignore.\n\nBut when it comes to gift-giving, there are usually two components to any gift: The material gift itself, and the thought behind it, which includes your choice of gift.\n\nIf someone wishes for something specific within your budget, you get them that of course, but if they don't, then I think that, if the two of you give gifts to each other, which apparently you generally do, you should choose something you think they would enjoy, rather than stop giving gifts altogether.", "She's trying to get people to text her during ridiculous hours rather than just saying she wants to go NC with them, and you're trying to get her to respond to you which she obviously isn't going to do. I suggest you stop communicating with her unless she contacts you first. If you never hear from her again, you'll know that's the way she wants it. Just get her a $20 gift card in an envelope with a greeting card at Christmas and another with a birthday card on her birthday.", "So wait\u2026\u2026 3am to 6am are her receptive hours? Ok fine, but it\u2019s a group chat? So she can\u2019t just be normal and scroll up to read missed messages during 3am to 6am, and then respond to messages addressed to her? That\u2019s too hard? \n\nOr if she gets a personal text, she can\u2019t just respond to them during her scroll time? \n\nSeriously? Nah fam, I\u2019d keep her off my gift list or event invite list because she\u2019s being super extra. NTA.", "NTA. Those aren\u2019t boundaries those are unreasonable demands. Sounds like she\u2019s not happy she works those hours and wants to other people to suffer too. If she had notifications turned off then checking her texts and chats when she\u2019s up would be what any normal person would do. More people in the family need to start doing what you\u2019re doing.", "NTA. I'm a night worker and my rule for people who KNOW my schedule (coworkers, people close to me) is not to call after noon unless it's an emergency (and call more than once if it is emergent) or I will call you back at 3am.\n\nI made this rule after a PM coworker would call me during her shift multiple times to ask me how to do her job. People literally lived on site that could help her.\n\nMy family who lives 2hrs away/friends that don't know my schedule too well/delivery people, ect get a pass because I can't expect every rando to know my schedule. \n\nAnd texts can happen at any time, because scheduling a text is a hell of a lot more annoying than scheduling a call. And making it from 3-6a is just obnoxious.\n\nPart of working nights is learning how to adapt to a daywalker schedule. Doctor's offices, grocery stores, and most things you need to function in a society aren't always open at night, so you need a chunk of daytime hours set aside for getting stuff done that can't happen at night.\n\nI really hope your cousin doesn't live in an apartment. Nothing serves as a better reminder that you're on a different schedule than the rest of the world than children screaming right in front of your apartment, echoes of people going up and down stairs, thudding bass music from a car shaking your windows and walls, or power tools going on right outside your window. I got almost no sleep due to all the disturbances, and the only time I complained was when one particular neighbor who lived in a different building block decided that he would park in front of my apartment and play wall rattling music while he cleaned/worked on his car for at least an hour every day. And I still checked to make sure he was actually breaking city ordinance (daytime limit of 75 dB) before saying something to my landlord.", "Yta. \n\nLike.... Why did you need her to tell you what to get for her birthday?", "YTA - Just switch to communicating with her through email. Its asynchronous and she can get it when she wants.", "What I don't get is why 19 and 23 yo cousins are exchanging birthday and Christmas  gifts. Enough already. Problem solved.", "I also work nights and I am on group chats. I just mute them and I answer when I wake up. I do t expect people to bend to my \u201cawake hours\u201d of 4 am. That would be ridiculous. NTA and she needs to get rid of her main character syndrome", "NTA.  Demanding people only text you between 3am and 6am is ridiculous even if everyone texting you is 2nd or 3rd shift, let alone sleeping.  Your cousin can mute or turn off text notices.  What she set up isn't a boundary, it's an effort to control others", "NTA she\u2019s trying to control (you) especially by not responding to your texts and because of this put you in the bad guy position about Christmas. Next time don\u2019t ask just get her a Starbucks card and if she doesn\u2019t like it end the gift giving.", "NTA. You get to have boundaries too. \"I'm not staying up until 3am to text her\" is a great one. Tell her you won't do that and won't text her at all if that's the only time available. Then buy her socks for every occasion.", "NTA, your cousin is ridiculous; who does she think she is? Miranda Priestly?   \n\n\nThere's literally no good reason why she simply cannot just answer all text messages she received prior between her open hours of 3am to 6am.", "NTA. She can simply hide the alerts for the group chat, so she doesn\u2019t hear anything that comes in and she can look at it when she wakes up. To expect people to text her between those hours is stupid and ridiculous and nobody is going to do that. And if she really wanted something she should have sent you a link to something that she really wanted. Maybe a suggestion for the future is tell her to set up an Amazon wishlist, she can add stuff outside of Amazon, if she downloads the browser widget and then you\u2019ll know exactly what to get her.", "The point of written language is that we can leave messages for later. Tell her you understand that she will not be texting you right back if you message her outside of her \"on\" hours, but that your boundary is your sleep schedule, so you will message her while you're awake and she can hold off on replying until she's awake, but it's actively rude for her to try to push her boundaries into yours.", "NTA\n\nI worked nights for 14 years and this is ridiculous. Just mute the phone.\n\nI would just go NC, communication is a two way street.", "Nta. Fafo.", "NTA - Don't engage in her nonsense, or if you want to be petty tell her she has a 30 minute window on the 29th of each month where you will accept messages from people with <insert cousins name>", "Got socks for Christmas. Such an awesome present! And no, I'm not kidding. :D", "No, it's her way of trying to control people. I have worked the grave shift for a decade. My family knows this and know to just shoot me a text if they want to tell me something. If it's an emergency, call my husband. He is usually awake. I always respond back when I see the message. It hasn't been a problem at all. She is making it into a problem.", "Should've gotten her the cheapest thing on that site", "I got some towels! Precisely what I asked for (I really needed some new ones). They're great towels :)", ">Your cousin is weird\n\nYou mis-spelt *'an asshole'*", "No shes not. Theres no good reason for that. Text messages at whatever time they come in wait for you, you can respond at whatever time is good for you.", "Hear hear and OP NTA", "It looks like I'm one of the only people who agrees with you. The best gifts are surprises that demonstrate an understanding of the person."]}
