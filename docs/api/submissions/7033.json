The issue is with communicating with her. The rest of our family operates during the day, and so (obviously) all of our texting and phone calls take place at day time. We don\u2019t call Jen but we do text her. None of us expect a reply straight away, but by her own admission, she wakes up at 5pm and leaves for work at 10pm so she has at least 5 hours to text back. I\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t expect a text back the same day but recently it\u2019s gotten ridiculous. \n\nShe sent a text to the family group chat \u2018setting her boundaries\u2019. It was 1 rule; do not text her during the day. Her \u2018open hours\u2019 are from 3am to 6am. Now, I get those are her awake hours, but she\u2019s in the minority here. There\u2019s 30 people in this group-chat and she\u2019s the only one who operates at those hours. Of course, there will be some outliers, but I\u2019m not staying awake until 3am to shoot her a quick text about if she wants red or green napkins. I\u2019m all for setting and sticking to boundaries, but this is ridiculous. \n\nI sent her a text in November asking her what she wanted for Christmas and her birthday (early Jan) but she didn\u2019t respond. So I didn\u2019t get her anything. I was getting frustrated with Christmas gift fever and burnout and I felt like she was being deliberately irritating. She was leaving all my messages on read. Even ones where I said I can\u2019t wait any longer to wait for her replies so now is her last chance before I skip her. \n\nI should note that I'm not texting her non-stop. I barely text her outside of Christmas and birthday shopping. I don't think it's rude or unreasonable to respond to a text about what you want as a gift in a reasonable time frame. Again, I'm not expecting same-day replies, but if you want something, you answer. I'm not a mind-reader.\n\nChristmas rolled around and everyone seemed to notice that I hadn\u2019t gotten her anything. Jen seemed a little upset but she didn\u2019t tell me, so how would I know? I tried talking to her later about her birthday, but again, she wouldn\u2019t respond. So I did the same thing. \n\nFor her birthday, she simply sent me a link to an online shop, but no links to t-shirts she liked, or anything. I asked her what she wanted, and no response. I didn't get her anything. Her birthday was yesterday and apparently, she's been really upset. Her mum said I should have just gotten her what she asked for and ball-parked sizes. Here's the thing; she didn't send me the links to t-shirts, she sent me the links to whole websites with no indication of what t-shirts she wanted. I even text-searched to check in case I missed it. I asked her what t-shirt she wanted and she left me on read. \n\nI told my aunt this, but she said I need to understand and respect her 'boundaries'. I told her it's unreasonable to expect everyone to operate on her hours when her hours aren't the norm and that's she's being a hypocrite because she also complains about Jen not responding. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673406879, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108twxx/aita_for_not_getting_my_cousin_a_birthday_or/", "score": 1498, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just don\u2019t see the big deal about sending texts when it\u2019s convenient for you and expecting a response when the recipient has the time. But now I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s just because I grew up and began my career when telephone (land line!) was the only way to communicate. It could take days to reach someone, and you never really knew why. Did they get your message? Have they been incredibly busy with other stuff? Traveling? Sick? Dead? Who knew! IIRC it sucked to wait for a call back, but it was generally understood that the person making the call was not automatically entitled to an immediate response.\n\nI love the convenience of texting but I view it as just another communication option. If I don\u2019t get a text response when I need it, I try an email or call. If everyone uses text as their one and only mode of communication, won\u2019t we end up in the equivalent of the telephone age? Does anyone else feel like any communication you send is really just an invitation to a dialog? If you expect an immediate text response isn\u2019t that like showing up on someone\u2019s doorstep with a bullhorn and demanding you talk to them NOW? Are chat group members expected to review ALL texts? Even if every person in a 30 person group sends only 1 response, that\u2019s a lot of messages!

NTA , your cousin is tho", "NTA.  Where is it written that anyone is under any obligation to get someone a gift?", "My husband is a shift worker. He puts his phone ok silent during the day when he's sleeping. He doesn't have rules about when people can message him, he just responds when he is available.\n\nYour cousins boundaries are a little weird, but she doesn't get to complain because people choose to respect them, also, if she never responds with specific answers for questions like the one you asked, she shouldn't be miffed that people aren't mind readers. NTA. You're not a mind reader.", "NTA i work overnights too, and i dont expect people to go out of their way and stay up just to send me a text message. The thing about a text that she seems to fail to realize, is they will stay there, regardless of what time its sent / received. It wont magically disappear after a few minutes. I get texts during the day all the time. If i am expecting something important, ill stay up for a bit to have a conversation. But other than that, i reply when i can during my breaks at work. And its fine.", "NTA. She is the one on the weird schedule, that means she has to figure out accommodations.  Besides a text can be read and responded to whenever, that is what makes them so great. Your cousin is being a brat.", "Like, you do know you can schedule texts to send at another time right? \n\nESH. Her for how she reacted, and you for not respecting her boundaries.", "NTA but please please please get a round robin for gifts going with people of your generation. Put everyone's name in a hat and you buy a gift for the person you draw. If you draw yourself or your SO draw again. Easy peasy.", "I was ready to tell you off from the title. But the thing is, you didn't get your cousin anything because she's basically ghosting you.\n\nNTA.", "ESH - just get her a generic gift card.  I don't know anyone who requires a direct link for a gift to be given to them outside of a wedding registry, it's to demonstrate thought and care from the gift giver.  INFO: Did she get you a gift?", "She only wants texts between 3a and 6a?  That's stupid.  Why are 5p-10p off limits, when she's up?", "Most people aren't even awake for the 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  I've worked nights and she's being ridiculous NTA. \n\nBut then I am an asshole and I would have just never texted her to begin with. I'd like to point out that you were much nicer than I would have been. Because I'm not waking up at 3 fucking a.m. to ask somebody what gift they want.", "Why don't you schedule your texts to send within her time frame then? Smartphones are magical creatures.", "Creating and communicating expectations of behaviour is. The thing is that the cousin\u2019s execution is really terrible but the reason behind why she is putting the rules down is valid.", "Haha I understand your mindset, but when it comes to family politics it\u2019s never that easy.", "The thing is, the cousin is responsible for their boundaries, not everyone else.\n\n\"Only text me between 3am-6am\" \n\nversus\n\n\"I will only be able to respond to texts between 3am-6am\"\n\nThe boundary is when the cousin will deal with messages. She doesn't get to dictate when other people send messages.", "I worked the 10pm-6am schedule for a year and would also wake up from 2-5pm. \n\nYour cousin is being completely unreasonable by giving the worst possible hours for communication. Most people are asleep from 3am-6am. Even a lot of night owls are heading to bed during those hours. Why can\u2019t she respond from 5-10pm? That\u2019s when I\u2019d talk to people and get everything I needed done for the day. You are NTA.", "An extra phone would be an added expense.  I do block everything except their calls and texts.  They just text for silly stuff.  It's gotten better since I've started answering them after I get to work.  And I go to day shift sometime in the next few months, so it'll be ok", "What about a Google Voice number? Are those still free? Just a thought, since the future is mysterious, but it might be a good \"Red Alert\" number you can leave unblocked...", "I probably could, but it's for another 3 months, tops.  I'll muddle through and we'll all get back to a day shift routine. Hopefully I'll learn to sleep at night", "NTA.\n\nYou are completely respecting her boundaries. Within, of course, your own rules and habits of existence. Like, not waking up at 3 am to send her a text, and not doing the \"pulling teeth\" approach of asking for more info about the website(s).\n\nWhat an infuriating little snot. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Your cousin is acting absolutely wild here. I'm a night owl, and I've worked night shifts in the past, and the one (1) time I yelled at someone for texting me while I was sleeping is because I was sick with the flu and he was also knocking on my window to wake me up at a time he knew I would be asleep. Respect her boundary by not interacting with her over texts or including her in holiday gifts anymore. If that's not an acceptable way to respect her boundary to her then it's not a boundary, it's an attempt at control.\n\nHonestly, though, your aunt seems like she might be the one actually causing drama. Your cousin has been quietly upset, but she hasn't been upset at you directly, so she sounds like maybe she is actually sticking to her boundaries in a reasonable way (even if the boundary is wild and going to exclude her from things). Your aunt is the one who heard \"I'm upset with the consequences of my actions\" and came at you with \"you're mistreating my baby.\"", "NTA I worked graves for many many years.  Yes you are in the minority.  Construction the Amazon driver the kids playing outside will drive you batty.  However your in the huge minority of life its self when you do graves.  I wouldn't waste my money worrying about the tee shirts of she wouldn't give me a size.  She's using her job and her hours to weaponize it for everyone to fail to meet her expectations.  If she keeps this up she is going to alienate a lot of people.", "Nta she is too ridiculous", "So NTA. Your cousin can't seriously expect most people to wait until the middle of the night to text her right?? There's no reason she can't read and respond to your messages in the times that she is awake and free to do so, which I would assume to be 3am to 6am. Her 'boundaries' are extremely stupid and make no sense.", "NTA, honestly it would a lot easier to communicate if it were \"I won't *respond* to messages outside these hours\" Meaning you could text her at 1 pm and she just wouldn't respond till the 3-6am timeslot. You'd still get your answer, she'd still get her boundary.", "NTA. She left you on read meaning she had opened them at some point. Point out that she could easily respond when you\u2019re asleep and if she says something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m not rude\u201d just say \u201cno, you\u2019re a passive aggressive crybaby that thinks she\u2019s above everyone and delusional to think she\u2019s high profile enough to dictate others schedules\u201d and walk away", "NTA\nThat's the entire point of texts tho! \nIn any case - she didn't tell you what you want, so how are you suppused to know?", "NTA. Not that you need to do this, but you can schedule send texts. Text whenever you need, but schedule it for 3am so she'll read it and respond. Then you can check the response whenever like a normal person.", "Ask her in the group chat. She is obviously checking this.", "NTA but man I'd start being petty. \n\n\"We're going to Disneyland tomorrow you wanna come?\"\n\"I just won the lottery I want to give you 25k can you respond?\" \n\"I just broke my leg trying to type can you help me out?\"", "NTA.  Your cousin sounds strange.  Personally, I'd just drop her off the group chats and let her decide if she wants to have any contact.\n\nBut for your issue with her sending you a link to the website but not to a specific t-shirt that she might want.  There's a great new (ok - not so new) thing called a gift-card.  OP could have easily purchased one of those.  Same thing for Christmas - just a generic one (like a Visa gift card).\n\nIt's still NTA because the cousin's boundries are ridiculous - who is going to text her between 3am and 6am?", "NTA Cousin should manage her phone to not bother her while she sleeps. I worked nights for years without issue. I still have my phone on silent when I sleep even though I'm old now with no friends.", "NTA her open hours are 3-6am, which to normal people means she gets back to you are those times not text her at those times and you get a response.", "NTA. Anyone who requests to only get texts from 3am-6am is a bag of nuts. I would stop texting her and let her know if she'd like presents in the future at family gatherings, she can E-MAIL YOU ANYTIME (provide your email addy) with suggestions, sizes, and links to things she'd like, not just to a certain shop. Suggest she give you at least 3 specific ideas per present. Say that you are NOT awake and never will be during the hours of 3-6am, so she won't be hearing from you by text again in order for you to \"respect her boundaries.\"  ETA: Give her malicious compliance in the future. ETA: In --> IS", "Nah, $5 gift card for either a grocery store or some expensive place", "Lollll", "In a comment OP says that she does keep her phone on DND or on mute during sleep. She just doesn't want ANYONE texting during those hours regardless and refuses to answer texts outside her range", "Ok she doesn\u2019t want. People also doesn\u2019t want so end game is no one chat. Why is she pissed? It\u2019s ok for her to ignore ppl text but it\u2019s not ok vice versa?", "Do you just text her in group chat or privately. Because I could see it being hard to keep up hours/day later in a group chat of 30", "Her boundary is \u201cI set the rule and if you don\u2019t follow, I\u2019m angry!!!\u201d /s", "What are you talking about? When I get either a text or an email, I receive a notification on my phone, which I can respond to at my leisure. \n\nAnd no, no one is expecting her to respond synchronously. OP literally said she knows it can take her a few days to respond."]}
