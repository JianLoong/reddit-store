You should have asked others in your family if it was wanted.  If your mom wanted it sold she would have done it herseld", "Need much more context, but based on what little context you\u2019ve given I\u2019d say YTA. Why didn\u2019t you ask your sister if she wanted it before you sold it?", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s a family heirloom. If you had no other surviving relatives, sure, but your mother made the choice to pass it on. If she wanted to see it sold she would\u2019ve cashed it out herself.", "YTA You sold a family heirloom. It was yours. Fine. You should have given your siblings first right of refusal. You are a total and complete irredeemable AH.", "YTA. Your mom is also the mother of your sister. Even though your mom passed it to you, you should have atleast talk to her about it. You hurt her feelings by not doing so.", "YTA - family heirlooms aren't trinkets to sell to make a few quid, they're a break glass in case of emergency item that should only be sold if completely necessary.", "Based from the post, yes, you are. You already knew it was a tradition within your family - like a heirloom. Knowing that you mother used to own it and you have a sister who also happened to have kids, it's not something you can decide on your own. It felt like the sentimental value of the dress lost all its meaning.", "YTA. \n\nYour mom gave it to you rather than sell it presumably because she wanted it to stay within the family. You might already have had your wedding and not needed it but. What about your moms future/current grandchildren? Perhaps speaking with your siblings would have been a good idea. \n\nMy mom and dad had their vow renewal last year, I\u2019m already married but if my mom was to pass her dress down to me. There is no way I would be able to consider selling it. In the same way that I hope my daughter wouldn\u2019t sell my dress without discussion with other family members who would maybe like to use it.", "YTA. Mothers pass on wedding dresses to the child they want to be the caretaker of the dress. I sincerely doubt your mother thought you would do something so selfish with the dress.", "YTA for not offering to sell it to her first.", ">she wanted to pass it on to her kids\n\nThe money is more important to you than this?", "YTA - It didn't occur to check if anyone in your family wanted it before you sold it? It might not have been her dress, but it was your sister's mother, right? It's at best clueless.", "YTA.\n\nYou may have had the legal right to sell the dress, but you should have talked to your family first.  A wedding dress often carries a great deal of meaning.  But you knew that.", "YTA\n\nYou definitely should have talked to your family members about it first to see if anyone else wanted it.", "Yta. Ur mother gave it to u to keep not sell. I assume so it could stay in the family.", "YTA, and this sounds like one more example of why people need to have very specific wills. Your mom probably thought you\u2019d do the right thing and pass it along to your sister if you didn\u2019t want or weren\u2019t going to wear the dress someday.", "YTA. If you didn\u2019t want it you should have offered it to her. You sold an incredibly sentimental and irreplaceable piece of family history. You know full and well your mother did not give you that dress to sell it. You suck!", "Yta", "Yup. YTA. You did this without talking to her??! You are a total A!", "Your mother most likely wanted it to stay within the family as a heirloom, why not just pass it down to your sister to give to her kids so it stays in the family as your mom clearly wanted it to be? YTA", "Going against the grain here but NTA. It's your dress. Period. The moment it was given to you, it was yours to do with what you wanted. You mother should have been more careful who she picked or she should have dealt with the dress herself. She should have asked all of her daughters what they would do with the dress before giving it away. Once it's yours, no one else actually gets a say. I'm not here for people cluttering up other's homes in the name of \"heirlooms\". They don't have to live with the lost space the item takes up or the dusting and upkeep. There is enough stuff taking up space as it is.", "YTA\n\nIf you needed the money so badly you could've asked your sister to buy it\n\nWhich is still kind of an AH move unless you're flat broke and about to be homeless\n\nShould have given it to your sister.", "It\u2019s really hard to side with your sister after hearing that she\u2019s posting on FB rather than talking to you about it, but YTA.  Legally, you\u2019re in the clear - it was left to you.  Were you obligated to ask?  Of course not.  But it\u2019s a sentimental item and you could have at least offered to sell it within the family first if the money was the most important thing to you.", "YTA for not giving sister first dibs.", "YTA\n\nHer claim to the dress was as strong as yours. You should have consulted her.", "Unless you can't buy the dress back, I hope you are splitting the money with your sister and other siblings. \n\nI hate that people take to social media to air their personal problems. Grow up people! Rant over.\n\nYTA for not talking to your sister and any other siblings before selling the dress.", "YTA", "YTA. seems like a thing to discuss with others before selling.", "YTA you shouldn't have sold your mother's dress without consulting your siblings.", "Yta if you didn\u2019t want it for whatever reason you should have asked if someone else wanted it. Now if your sis took it then sold it that would make her the ah. But that\u2019s not the case", "YTA", "What are you, the sister from 27 Dresses?\n\nYeah, YTA. It was her mother too.", "NTA. Your mother gave it to you and not your sister. If she had wanted it she could have asked for it from your mother. She is angry because it is sold and you got the money not her.", "Unpopular oinuon here. Your mother left the dress to *you*.  You don't say she left any special instructions as to what to do with it, therefore, it was yours to do with as you pleased, and you were under no obligation to ask anyone, including your sister.  Maybe it was left to you expressly because your mother didn't want your sister to have it, who knows? Unless you're hiding some essential info, based on the info given, I say NTA.  Just because it was your mother's dress doesn't make it a \"family heirloom\".", "NTA.  The dress was left to YOU, not her.  It is not hers to decide what to do with it.", "I think you could have had a word with her whether she wanted to buy it from you but nonetheless your mother passed it to you so it\u2019s your decision whether you want to sell it or not", "If your mother wanted it to go to sister/sister's kid, mother would have left it to her. ?\n\nMaybe she hoped it would/could go to your daughter? Oldest girl to her oldest, kinda thing?", "Rare NTA. She left is specifically to you. You got it valued and if a family member wanted it they would have had to pay for it. I would have sold it too. If your mother wanted it to be passed on as an heirloom to grandchildren she should have specified that. Once it was legally left to you; you can do whatever you please with it.\n\nEdit; don\u2019t know why all the NTA responses are being downvoted. This is literally one of the most clear cut NTA I\u2019ve seen on here in ages. It was willed to you to do as you please with it. Legally; your sister has no standing and morally to as it\u2019s now your belonging.", "NTA. It was yours to do as you saw fit.", "NTA.  After being given to you it became your property to do with as you wish.  Wedding dress styles change over time so it would be highly unlikely that your nieces would have worn it.", "NTA OP. Sis could have bought or indicated her interest and taken responsibility for it.", "Unpopular opinion ---- NTA-- the dress was given to you, it was yours to do as you wish with.", "NTA - yours to sell so not", "Your dress, your decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "NTA provided you shared the profits with your sister. MOST brides have no desire to wear their mother\u2019s wedding dresses much less their grandmother\u2019s. You\u2019ve saved guilt on behalf of your nieces.", "NTA Why does your sister assume that her children will want the dress? It's a DRESS. It is not an heirloom. Styles change all the time, not to mention not everyone is the same size. Yeah, I understand your sister is upset about it. Also, how old are her children that she's already planning weddings for?", "NTA-  \nAs soon as your mother passed it on to you, it became YOURS.  \nYou can do whatever you like with your things.   \nIf your mother wanted to pass it on to your sister, she would have.   \nAnd especially with fragile textiles, unless someone in the family is able to maintain them, it makes sense to do whatever you choose to do with them while they are still in good shape", "Technically NTA. Your mother passed the dress to you, presumably with no stipulations. Then technically it was yours to do what you wanted with.\n\nYour sister's behavior is immature\u2014airing out family disagreements on Facebook is childish. It's also entitled for her to think that her children automatically would have gotten to wear the dress. After all, it belonged to you, you could have refused when the time came.\n\nThat said, I can also very much see where your sister's upset is coming from. You may have overlooked something when you sold the dress without consulting her.\n\nEven though the dress came down to you, this was her own mother's wedding dress too. So it's an item of great potential emotional significance for her, along with being a family heirloom as others have mentioned. I think you might have overlooked the fact that she might have liked to have had a say in what happened to the dress, if you didn't want it.\n\nFamily heirlooms seem to be kind of funny. Even if they're passed down to you and therefore technically, legally belong to you, it's almost like they're not really, truly, *wholly* yours. There seems to be an unspoken etiquette where if you don't want it, one is expected to ask other family members if they would want it, before disposing of it.\n\nIt's like you need \"permission\" before doing anything with a family heirloom, even if it's legally yours.\n\nAnd I see how it gets sticky because heirlooms can be of significant monetary value and be considered part of one's inheritance. In which case, the person who inherited said valuable heirloom technically has the right to sell it and keep the money. It doesn't seem fair to them to offer up a valuable heirloom to another family member for free. And it also seems awkward, cold and transactional to \"sell\" an heirloom to a family member.\n\nI see it as quite gray, really. I don't think you did anything wrong technically, but do consider your sister's hurt feelings. I'd also call her out on her behavior and call a spade, a spade.\n\nIs there a way for you or your sister to buy back the dress?\n\nEdit: Typo", "NTA\u2026 it was gifted to you to do what you pleased\u2026 I am curious to know whether the sister communicated with you of her plans prior to ur decision tho\u2026", "NTA, the family heirloom was passed down to you, it\u2019s effectively yours. You sold it for good money. Your sister\u2019s upset because her hypothetical daughter won\u2019t get to ask to wear something that belongs to her aunt.", "NTA  Just ignore her back and too bad so sad!", "NTA.

It is a memory of her mother sure but there's no deeper family history. It was shiny, brand new when Mum wore it. Vintage items like this are difficult to care for and with the kind of embellishment described, doubly so. By the time OP's niblings are old enough to be married it's not going to be wearable.
