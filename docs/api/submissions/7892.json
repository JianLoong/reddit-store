It happened for a lot of reasons, mainly for financial reasons, and because we have a daughter.\n\nMy husband and I are 19. We have a 4 month old daughter. It\u2019s important to note, he grew up very poor. He\u2019s been my boyfriend since we were 14. My parents were pretty middle class, but were still married and still are today, and I lived a great childhood.\n\nMy husbands mom wasn\u2019t in the picture, dad was really poor. He\u2019s picked up a lot of habits from his dad.\n\nMy husband graduated a year early. He is very good with numbers and my dad knows that. My dad owns a finance company and he wanted my (now) husband to get his degree so he could work at his company. He did, he\u2019s been there for 6 months now. This is the first time in his life he has been financially stable. We live in a small but nice house in a great neighborhood.\n\nMy husband has picked up some bad habits from his dad. He won\u2019t eat until me and the baby are fed. Even though, obviously, our daughter does not eat food yet. He knows how breastfeeding can really mess with your appetite, (as some other moms know) you may feel full but after you nurse you\u2019ll feel hungry again. He says \u201cI\u2019m actually not hungry yet\u201d even though he\u2019s admitted he just doesn\u2019t like to eat until he knows everyone else is full.\n\nWell, a few times he\u2019s told me that we hit our savings goal, for the month, and he\u2019s told me to go treat myself. So far I\u2019ve always refused and suggested we put that extra money into our savings. My husbands phone doesn\u2019t really work. He\u2019s had the same phone since middle school and he says a new phone is a waste and he\u2019d rather me treat myself. \n\nToday he again, told me to treat myself. This time I said \u201cok, I will\u201d and he was really happy. I went to the apple store and bought him a new iPhone. Not  a super expensive one, in fact, damn near the cheapest one there. \n\nWhen he got home he was really excited and asked what I bought myself. I said I bought *him* a new phone and gave it to him. he asked if I was high. I\u2019ve never drank alcohol, let alone drugs so it was obviously a sarcastic remark. I said no. He was mad. He said that he told me to buy something for me, not him, and that he\u2019s upset I didn\u2019t buy something for myself, and got him something instead. He\u2019s now \u201creally disappointed\u201d and hasn\u2019t even opened his new phone.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t understand he is not poor anymore. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about everything. We save a good amount, and he told me to go treat myself, and buying him a gift is what I chose to treat myself with- the gift of giving.", "created_utc": 1674282679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hkr19/aita_for_buying_my_husband_a_new_phone/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The mentality associated with growing up poor is not something you can just turn off quickly or easily.  \n\nYour gesture was sweet/kind but obviously it threw him into a loop for what he saw as an unnecessary expense.  What's done is done, but next time... Maybe buy him a new phone, but not a brand (Apple) that is notorious for being expensive.  \n\nBTW, everything aside, you got yourself a good man.", "Oh, NTA. I get why he's upset you used the money \"on him\", but explain that having peace of mind that he has a working phone when you may need him was the best gift to yourself could think of.

His \"bad habits\" as you call them are direct responses to not having necessities as a child. Also you're both 19. It's been like max two years since you were both kids yourselves. Give him time to spend more than six months having money because this is going to take him some getting used to. \n\nTell him getting the phone is a present to yourself just this once because you love him and knew he needed a new phone so it made you happy.

I've seen this present itself in two different extremes, one is the one your husband has where he doesn't want to spend a penny more than necessary on himself. The other, is the complete opposite. It is being absolutely and completely irresponsible with money. My cousin is like this. He grew up with a single mom and they were actually homeless for a while; extended family took them in because all of the immediate family lived in the opposite side of the country. Through a lot of hard work and sacrifice, he is now a lawyer. He is married to a very successful woman and he does very well for himself. However, he is terrible with money. It's like he wants to revenge spend now that they are well off. It's gotten to the point where his wife has had to take over the financials and they have to talk through all purchases together. She told me that he was spending 10s of thousands on things that they have zero need for just because he could when she had to have a come to Jesus talk with him.", "NAH - You sound like a sweet couple, but I think you must understand he's going to have a hard time pulling out of the \"make do\" box he's in.  It's difficult to undo childhood conditioning, so he's likely to always be exceedingly frugal, and defer his needs.  It's how I grew up, and only now, in my late 40s, have I finally allowed myself to spend money on myself.\n\nJust keep reassuring him he's allowed this, and he doesn't have to constantly make sacrifices all the time.", "Well clearly NAH... he wants to treat you and you want to treat him... theres a lot of love there!\n\nHave you ever asked him why he feels the need to take of you and your daughter first, before himself? And why he doesnt want you to spend your money on him?\n\nThis is clearly more than just a superficial thing and requires professional treatment... which he will probably refuse haha.

I want you to download songs and make me a playlist. \u201c\n\nSide note: It is amazing that he is getting a position a such a young age. He should look into taking HR night classes. That degree, coupled with his work experience will open so many doors for him.", "NTA but I think that therapy would really help him through these issues he is having. It won't just fix himself and he does need help and really benefit him so you guys could do things together without having to feel poor all the time and start enjoying life. Get him some councilling together and separate so that ye can live a better life for your future \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, if seeing your husband happy is a treat for yourself, well so be it.

However, it will take more than a healthy bank balance to get out of the 'poor' mentality, tbh. He's so hellbent on providing, he doesn't know how to take gracefully.

That is what happens when you grow up poor and you put the ones you love ahead of yourself.", "YTA\n\nBut not at all a bad person.The two of you are absolutely adorable. \n\n There is something lovely about the way his history of poverty expresses itself in the man your husband is today. He's not stingy, he doesn't seem super anxious. He has some habits and patterns of behavior that are different. Let him,  do him. It hurts nothing to allow him to express his concern about you being taken care of by waiting to eat. It's likely that as time goes on, the pattern will shift, but I bet he'll still be focused on making sure you and your family are cared for. \n\nAs to your not 'treating yourself'. I've done that. Been difficult to give to. I learned that it stole my partners joy, when I rejected his generosity. He loves you, respects you and wants you to do something nice for yourself.

He won\u2019t eat until me and the baby are fed.\u201d*\n\nThis isn\u2019t a bad habit (IMO) it\u2019s a **very old school habit** like it or not. A gentleman doesn\u2019t eat until his partner and children have at least started. I\u2019m 58M child of older parents and learned this from my very old school (shaved briefly again, cleaned up, and put on a better suit for dinner) grandfather.\n\nIt\u2019s a **sign of respect** at least in my world.\n\nETA, NAH, it\u2019s \u201ccultural\u201d differences, easily solved", "NAH", "NAH but give him a little context. For instance, my husband was in an accident he was lucky to survive 5 years ago and I admit to being stressed when I can\u2019t reach him sometimes because it was such a close call then (the person who hit him was charged with felony DUI). Recently our boys were playing around while dad went to the store with our oldest daughter. I made the mistake of thinking I could safely use the bathroom and our 8 year old son smacked his head and got a huge gash that ended up needing stitches. Our 8 year old\u2019s world revolves around his dad so I knew that dad needed to take him in for stitches so that he could handle shots and everything better. My husband\u2019s ringer got shut off and the store was loud so he didn\u2019t see my calls or messages for about 20 minutes (the time it took me to deal with bleeding and get him ready to go see the doctor anyway) and my son was sobbing for dad. I eventually got one of them to answer and they hurried home so dad could take him for stitches. \nThose are my examples of why a dad/husband should have a reliable phone. Talk to him about that and that you want to be able to reach him easily if either of you or the baby ever have an emergency. Him having a reliable phone means that you don\u2019t have to walk for help if you have a car breakdown or some other problem. Point out how much this phone will help you and eventually help him realize that you want him to have needs and some wants fulfilled because you love him as much as he loves you.", "NAH but\u2026 you might want to stop focusing on trying to fix him. \n\nIt would make him happy if you treated yourself - why won\u2019t you let him be happy in this way?\n\nYou\u2019re young, so I\u2019m saying this gently, but it comes across as quite controlling of you. And puts you close to being the AH here. \n\nYou say you guys can afford a bit of fun, and it would be easy enough to do without spending a fortune. I am certain you can find a way to indulge yourself that is enough to make him happy you\u2019re having a treat, but not so big that it impacts your finances. A fun girly magazine, or a new nail varnish, or a new plant for the windowsill / garden, or\u2026 there are loads of ways to \u201ctreat yourself\u201d that can be done on a small budget. \n\nPlease consider that it is VERY, VERY IMPORTANT to your husband to make you happy. \n\n**It is an act of love from you to him, to let him know that he is succeeding at making you happy**.  Do it often. For small & big stuff. For example - if he comes straight to you & your baby for a kiss when he gets home, without stopping to sort through the mail, if that makes you happy then tell him. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you should blow your budget or stop saving so that he can see you having daily treats - that would be silly - but once a fortnight you could go out for a fancy coffee with a friend (if that\u2019s your idea of a treat). And then come back & tell him how happy you are. \n\nLet him make you happy. It matters. \n\nDo this first. Stop resisting his harmless attempts to make you happy. \n\nAnd yes, I would **return the iPhone** while you still can. I get that you wanted to treat him, but you shouldn\u2019t have done this. \n\nHe is an adult - he needs to be the one who decides when his phone is replaced. It\u2019s ok to talk to him about it. It\u2019s ok to make statements about how it impacts you - for example if his current phone is unreliable because of its age, you can tell him that worries you because you would like to be able to get in touch with him if there\u2019s a problem. \n\nBut the **basic principle in healthy relationships** is: share how (thing) affects you, and let the other adult figure out how to solve the (thing). *Don\u2019t tell them what to do*. They can ask for help. Once you\u2019ve proved that you\u2019re not trying to control them you can offer help (but don\u2019t do this the first few times while you\u2019re changing your habits). \n\nThis is much harder to do than just bossing the other person around. It\u2019s a skill that many adults don\u2019t have. \n\nThe reason it\u2019s hard is that sharing how we feel about (thing) makes us vulnerable - and most of us don\u2019t want to do that. So instead we jump straight to trying to control their behaviour, so that they don\u2019t do the (thing) that makes us have the feelings that we would rather avoid having. Letting yourself feel those feelings & focus on how you can better manage your own feelings, and share those feelings with your husband is advanced level emotional skills. But so totally worth it. \n\n**It\u2019s going to be a process to get your husband comfortable with money - it will happen over time if you allow it, and if he\u2019s open to it**. \n\n- Let him start by seeing you happy with your small treats. \n\n  - That\u2019s actually a good step that he\u2019s not hoarding All The Money out of fear it might all go away. (ie it could be worse!). \n\n  - and if you struggle with accepting the treats for yourself when he\u2019s not getting any - if that makes you feel selfish - then work through that. It\u2019s actually really important for mums to let themselves have a bit of self-care - lots don\u2019t think they should. That\u2019s a bad habit to get into. \n\n  - it would be ok if you admitted that you struggle to accept a treat only for yourself - talk that through with him - and then do it anyway. And talk about the feelings it brings up. Maybe they\u2019re similar to the feelings he has about allowing himself treats! \n\n  - if it\u2019s a genuine struggle for you to accept the treats then you could limit them to once a fortnight or even once a month. And / or limit it to a small fixed budget. It\u2019s ok to start small with this stuff while you process the feelings they bring up. \n\n- Once that\u2019s your normal, you could start choosing occasional treats that are for both of you to share \n\n  - Don\u2019t jump straight to doing this. It won\u2019t work. Let yourself have the treats he wants you to have for a bit\n\n  - And don\u2019t switch to only doing couple treats - mix & match. Continue with the \u201cthank you this made me happy\u201d and occasionally alternate with a \u201cIt would make me happy to do this thing with you\u201d\n\n  - since he has specific food-related issues, maybe don\u2019t do shared food treats to start with\n\n- once this has become your normal (maybe 1 out of 3 fortnight treats is a shared couple one) and you are both comfortable with accepting treats - you could start to introduce food-related treats\n\n  - maybe bring home some fancy popcorn to share in front of a film as a date night\n\n  - maybe buy a super fancy starter or dessert from the supermarket for you guys to share together (as in - don\u2019t push for a whole meal together if he struggles with that. Start more at the \u201csnack\u201d level\n\n  - remember to keep telling him how happy it makes you that you can share this lovely moment with him\n\n  - maybe buy a fancy candle (totally ok if it\u2019s a battery one for safety - they do some really nice fake ones now) as one of your couple treats, and use it to make \u201cmood lighting\u201d for date nights at the table - just with the starter or dessert\n\n  - don\u2019t rush this. You don\u2019t want it to feel like you are bullying him into change or like you\u2019re being his therapist. But it\u2019s also ok that him being more flexible in this area (eating *with* you) would make you very happy, and will probably harm your relationship in the long term if he doesn\u2019t address it. \n\n- **see this as a journey**. You are both very young. If it takes 5 months till you can buy a \u201ccouple treat\u201d and then a few more months till he\u2019s comfortable having \u201cdate night dessert\u201d together, then you\u2019re still going to be in a much better place by next Christmas. \n\nGood luck, and enjoy the journey!", "NAH\n\nBut your gift backfired because of your husband's childhood.  It's going to be very hard for you to really understand this because you didn't live your husband's life as a child.  He may not have eaten for days and had to make do with second or third hand clothing that were falling apart for much of his childhood.  But you knew that you would have a hot meal every night for dinner.  It's hard to really understand unless you lived the same life.\n\nYou are both really young and you have only very recently been in a position where he is earning comfortable money.  His behaviours are ingrained and he may also be worried if anything changes so just wants to save as much as he can.  He will find it hard to spend money on himself because he has never really experienced that.\n\nTime will help this and good communication.  Therapy may be beneficial but he may not need or want it.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nI would consider not calling his propensity to consider others before himself a bad habit - it is more a redeeming quality. I can see how it can be a bit too much if the person lacks a sense of rationality about it. \n\nIt also sounds like your husband could use a little therapy in learning that it's ok for him to be nice to himself.", "A gentle YTA even though your intentions were good   You went against his wishes, and didn't listen to him.", "yta\n\nyou lied to your husband", "Soft YTA. You say your treat was the gift of giving - but you need to understand that's exactly what he wanted as well, by telling you to treat yourself, so your gift to him actually took his enjoyment away.\n\nIf he's happy with his phone, that really is his decision. If you can, return it rather than imposing it on him. \n\nThen have a conversation about how you would like to be able to treat him occasionally, and listen to how he feels. If he doesn't enjoy spending money or receiving gifts, find other ways to treat him - going for walks to places he likes, cooking meals he enjoys - and express your appreciation for him that way. I understand he grew up poor, but that doesn't necessarily mean his frugality now is a problem as long as you have a happy life.", "I hope he\u2019ll get better one day. He means the world to me.

Having a good, current, reliable phone so he can be reached, get photos of you and your baby while he\u2019s at work, and maybe do some outside work hours reading/networking is a super critical piece of that. If you frame it that way he might be more amendable.", "This is a reference to a beautiful story by O. Henry, \u201cThe Gift of the Magi\u201d, which I highly recommend you read.", "OP's husband isn't intentionally doing this but his attempts to care for his family is not reasonable to the situation (e.g OP pointing out the baby literally doesn't eat food yet so the need to wait for the baby to eat/ration food is unnecessary. OP shared in another comment he literally refuses to eat dinner with her even though OP wants him to because he didn't want to eat until he sees them eat). It comes from a good place, but these are maladaptive coping habits from his past that no longer work. My mom has somewhat similar behaviors. So I know how sometimes hard it is to see a loved one prioritize others above themselves in a way that doesn't even meet the current needs of their loved ones. \n\nIf the behavior isn't conscious and isn't productive and can't be changed when it no longer fits the situation, there's something more there. \n\nUltimately a person can only change if they are aware/want to, but it's worth having a conversation about. OP, I think you're valid in feeling concerned and wonder if he's open to exploring how his past has affected him. Maybe sit him down and gently ask him about his response.", "Husband cannot accept a gift and be happy and thankful for his sweet wife, instead he gets mad at her. This is exactly what trauma does to people.", "It's a coping technique due to the trauma of being poor.  Of not knowing whether you were going to eat that night or whether if something breaks it would be fixed any time soon.. or knowing your shoes have holes in the soles but you daren't ask for a new pair because you know your dad only worked 2 days that week.\n\nIt's an ingrained pattern of behaviour due to how you were brought up and it's hard to change that.  You are always saving for a rainy day and just in case.", "Have you tried talking to him in the way that you make it about you when you want a behavior to change? Like, don't say: \"I know that you are hungry\", but instead say: \"I would be happy if we could sit at the table as a family. I want to be with the 2 people I love here and it makes me sad to eat alone. Could you maybe just grab a little bite, even if you're not hungry? It would mean so much to me.\"\n\nSame for the phone: \"I am feeling more safe when I know that I can reach you whenever I need to, it gives me a feeling of security and this is very important to me. Also our baby is growing up so quickly and changing so fast and I have way too few pictures of me with her in it. I really want to have nice pictures to look back at when she's older and I had hoped you could snap them with the phone. \"\n\nJust an idea. Make him feel selfless by doing things for him, this could help him now, by time he will come around to a healthy level of treating himself.", "Hey, I just wanted to say that your feelings are valid and I agree these are maladaptive habits from his past experiences. And I'm going to lightly disagree with a lot of people here that says there is no harm. My mom has some similarities and I know how hard it can be to see a loved one sacrifice themselves for you in ways you didn't ask them to and don't actually need. When I tell others, they also tell me she's very sweet. It comes from love but also comes from a deeper place if it isn't a reasonable response to the current situation or something he can change to adapt to the current situation. It will take time but it can't change until he's aware there's an issue. And there is, for both for you because you want him to feel more secure and for him because he's still reacting in ways he learned when he was younger rather than letting himself heal. I'd try having some gentle but honest conversations with him if he's open to it. Try asking him rather than telling him and see if he himself don't eventually see the contradictions in his response. But be kind and know that it can be really hard to navigate his feelings of scarcity.", "And also say that being able to give something back to him for all he does for you, allbeit a material gift, makes you happy.

I would suggest counseling for your husband, but he probably will not go unless you can find it for free (please look, there are options). It seems sweet at first glance that he is so concerned about putting his family first, but that level of financial fear will cause problems in the future when you need to buy something that he thinks is unnecessary, or move to a more suitable home when he feels you can \u201cmake it work\u201d (for example, if your family grows and the house is too small), etc. \n\nFor now, try to explain to him that is IS a treat for you to get him something nice, and having a more reliable phone means he can be reached if you or the baby need him. He would hate it if you were stranded with a flat tire or at a restaurant and forgot money to pay the bill, etc. and could not reach him for help because his phone crapped out.", "NTA - Reframe this,  the phone isn't just for him,  it's for you and the baby.

I responded to exactly what YOU said. Changing goal posts again I see. He's a young, first time dad. He's emulating what he saw his dad doing, as that is what he now believes being a dad is about.

No.", "1) I'm a different person than the two that you replied to before\n\n2) your comparison is shit. laying the table in a certain way is not due to trauma, but refusing to eat with your wife when she ask you to because you grew up without having enough food to feed everyone and needing to prioritise the your wife and kid, when there is enough food for everyone to eat and the baby can't even ingest solid food is a trauma behaviour. you act as if growing up poor doesn't create trauma when it's well known it does", "Trauma comes as a result of living in and surviving impoverished situations. Researchers have revealed that socioeconomic status can be linked to a majority of anxiety disorders which can later manifest into PTSD. Food insecurity, financial woes, housing instability, along with living in vulnerable conditions can wear on one\u2019s psyche. Habitually living with depleted and distressed resources can induce traumatic memories. For some who have worked their way towards economic stability, flashbacks pertaining to the insecurity and difficulties they survived can rise to the surface weeks, months, or even years later.\n\nIn a 2016 study published in the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, researchers found 36% of women living in an economically disadvantaged part of Chicago were diagnosed with PTSD or borderline symptoms. The conclusion: When someone\u2019s day-to-day living situation is unstable and uncertain, there is greater risk of developing PTSD. Yet those in impoverished areas that have a greater need for intervention also have limited access to care.
