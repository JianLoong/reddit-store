This isn't exactly uncommon and I'm not sure why they're so up in arms and offended about it.", "NTA.\n\nWhat? Seriously, what? How could that possibly make you an asshole?\n\nYou didn't sit down and go \"mwaha, to show my disdain for the Polish language I will get myself bitten by a radioactive linguist and develop mutant accent powers.\"\n\nThis is *normal*. It happens even when you're speaking the same language the whole way through but move to a place where they speak it with a different accent. You got used to a different rhythm of speech. You'll probably settle back into more typical Polish soon enough, but it's only been a month, as opposed to twelve years away.\n\nPlus uh... some people are so insular, and proud of that, that they get offended at the mere reminder that people might have liked living anywhere but \"the old home town, where the family's been since before the invention of turnips.\" The opinions of people like that really aren't worth much, honestly.", "NTA. It happens naturally. They are upset because they think you've intentionally rejected Polish, but you haven't.", "NTA - it's not your fault, people acclimatise to new places and develop accents. Im from the south of england, but my family are all from up north, so when I go to visit them, I develop a northern accent. It just happens when you spend time around other people, it's very normal!", "My good friend is Irish, married to a Frenchman. When she speaks (English) the mixture of accents is like the tinkling of silver bells. I could listen to her all day. I love to hear the difference of the language, tinged with the colour of where people were born and where they have lived. Forget the rest of them, come and talk to me. NTA", "You rarely heard or spoke polish for 12 years straight, and you've only been back for one month. It will take time to slip back into it, it is just a lack of exposure but now you're immersed again. You did nothing wrong, you are NTA", "NTA, don't worry. Those people are not feeling well and wanted to take it out on you.", "NTA. My parents are both half viet, my mom is rural and my dad is midland and metropolitan. The accents and dialects are all over the place, plus being born in America and watching dubbed movies added to my vocal stew. You DO respect the language, it's just a new dialect. Your coworker sounds like the people freaking out over vocal fry or slang - changes organically happen to any language. You're trying, learning, and growing between different languages. Instead of being angry, be curious. Don't let them undermine your heritage/tongue.", "NTA. This happens naturally when you are immersed with people from other regions or speak different languages. Now that you are back, most of that will go away eventually, but some things may not change. Just think of it as what makes you unique based upon your experiences.", "NTA - Our brains are wired to do this. One of my kids was raised in the southeastern US until he was 4 & developed a southern accent from playing with his friends. We moved to England, he started school & he developed a British accent layered over the southern accent. (He became aware of his \"American\" accent &  purposefully tried to sound more English after classmates teased a bit over some of his southern accent. \"wahdder vs water\" etc. ) We moved back to the States a few years later - mid-west - and his accent shifted again & we can still hear little bits of southern & British accents in there. If you work on it, you can change it pretty quickly. But the woman who was offended is the A H. She must not have enough to do in life to worry about something so minor as your accent.", "You spent over a DECADE abroad. Of course your accent/speech was going to change! \n\nNTA", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with developing an accent or speaking a different language. People who are offended by that need to get over themselves.", "NTA That stuff happens naturally if you spend time away. Do they think you aren't allowed to travel/live where you want? I understand culture and heritage are important but they need to mind their own business.", "NTA. It is natural to absorb the inflections and pronunciations of other cultures when you live there. The accent you develop is like a road map of the places you\u2019ve lived and of your experiences. You should be proud of them. The woman who was offended by your accent was taking from pure xenophobia - part of xenophobia is that languages and cultures should remain \u201cpure.\u201d This is, of course, BS. Both evolve and change all the time for all sorts of reasons. \n\nIn contrast to those people, you should be proud of how you speak - it means you were brave enough to try new things and go to new places.", "NTA. Your coworker on the other hand... How anyone could be offended that someone has an accent is beyond me. Perhaps she feels jealous that you're more multilingual than her. Whatever the reason, never ever feel bad because of the way you speak.", "NTA, knowing multiple languages is difficult and things tend to bleed over.", "NTA, but there are so manny people who do it on purpose to show that they live or lived abraod that i can understand the feelings these people have..\n\nBtw, you will probably loose the \"accent\" quick enough now that you live in Poland again", "NTA you didn't develop an accent on purpose and as long as you're not acting like you're better than anyone else for knowing a ton of languages, the snarky and offended people can calm the fuck down. From what's written here, all you've done is exist with an accent.", "NTA. Once you speak more than one language things get funky upstairs. Words get jumbled, sentences get restructured, and sometimes letters get dropped.", "NTA. As an immigrant myself I get it. I have a slight accent in English and if I don't speak my mother tongue enough I start forgetting words. It's part of the experience. Your accent will probably fade overtime. \n\nAs someone from a neighboring country who visited Poland last year - enjoy the food, music, and culture.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People gave Madonna crap about her accent, too, but if you live in London, what do you expect? I worked with a nice Jamaican lady, and when she went home, her sisters told her she had an accent. She still sounded pretty Jamaican to me. But they weren't mad about it, they just teased her and it was cool.
