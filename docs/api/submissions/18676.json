My husband will come in typically before the meal is done, and I tell everyone it\u2019s time to eat and load up his plate. Usually the kids will come in and make their plates and there isn\u2019t much left by the time I get to the food. My kids have figured this out and will take less so that there is enough for the 4 of us once my husband takes more than what most people would consider his \u201dfair share\u201d.\nOther food related issues are when everyone pot lucks meals, and I make something for myself knowing that everyone, including my husband has already eaten. I will make enough for me, but he comes out just as I finish cooking or while I am eating and takes food I was planning on eating. Then gets mad at me for being upset and telling me I don\u2019t live alone and need to cook enough food for everyone every time I cook.\nAnother example is that I will buy something special as a treat for myself. Money is tight and I don\u2019t like wasting it on something frivolous. But every once in a while, I will buy a box of my favorite cookies or a small assorted flavor cheesecake, or my favorite pie. The kids know this is a treat I have gotten, because it isn\u2019t normal for us to have that in the house. They will either leave it alone or ask if they can have some. (Which I will always share). But my husband will eat the entire thing or take a fork and eat out of the container leaving a large hunk where someone has obviously taken a huge bite out of the middle or the side of a cake or pie. ( I should note, I work outside the home and he is home all day. So I will leave in the morning and there is a full container, but I get home and it is half to almost fully gone.)\nHe will also take a drink out of a bottle or can of something I am drinking without asking.\nThe kids will use their own money to buy a pizza or will door dash food to the house.

He will also go through the fridge and make note of what is in there and ask what is in a bowl or if someone made or ordered food after he has gone to bed.\nThis mindset and behavior pisses me off and we have had many fights over food. He tells me I have crazy food issues and to get over it. Food is meant to be eaten. And while I agree to a degree, I also think there should be some consideration.

Then you all have food. When you want a treat, take it to work. Not sure if your office has a fridge, but if it does take it there. Start labeling containers.

You may have \"weird\" food issues (your wirds), or your husband may be a jerk. Or, your husband may be an accidental jerk. Or it may be a combination. \n\nMy opinion is that this isn't actually JUST about the food. Simething deeper is going on with one or both of you. \n\nYou say he may be emotionally abusive (was that the worf you used?)... are there other situations that you think are abusive?

He sees food, he's hungry, he takes from the avaliable food. If you want a specific amount, take it for yourself! Either portion out everyones dinner, or take your own first. \n\nThen we have the casual food-sharing thing.
