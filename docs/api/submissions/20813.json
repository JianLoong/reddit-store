In my country, it is common for non-Chinese people to not speak/understand the local Chinese dialect, relying on English as a lingua franca. However, I can both speak and understand the local Chinese dialect.\n\nI was in the gym deadlifting >180kgs. There's a gym trainer (Trainer) 5 meters behind me training an older Chinese lady. The lady asks Trainer in Chinese 'what's the point of him lifting so heavy?'\n\nTrainer replies in Chinese with: \"Nothing, his body doesn't even look good, he's young so he can do it now but he will regret it in the future. His joints and bones will hate him.\" They then both begin to talk shit about me in a contemptuous tone loudly in Chinese, all the while I'm still only 5 meters away from them.\n\nI turned around and told Trainer \"I hear you\" in Chinese, and the blood immediately drains from his face. He takes the lady away and they finish their session in another part of the gym.\n\nWhen the session is over and the lady leaves, I go up to Trainer and confront him over what he was saying, and we have the following (from memory) conversation in Chinese:\n\nMe: \"Do you have a problem? If you have a problem, you can say it to me?\"\n\nTrainer: \"No there's no problem, I was only saying good things about you, she asked what was the point, and I said its just something he enjoys and he can continue to do so whilst he's young.\"\n\nMe: \"That is not what you said. Stop lying to me. You were talking shit in Chinese thinking I don't understand you. Well, you can clearly see I understand Chinese. Apologise to me.\"\n\nTrainer: \"Why would I apologise to you when I didn't do anything wrong?\"\n\nMe: \"You have disrespected me already by saying those things, and you are disrespecting me now by lying to me. If you don't apologise I will lodge a complaint against you; I have taken a video of you saying these things, and I will show it to your boss.\"\n\nI lied, I didn't have any video. I was bluffing because I wanted him to stop bullshitting me. Fortunately, he got visibly flustered and the bluff worked.\n\nTrainer: \"Look, I don't want our relationship to be damaged. if we see each other can we still be polite to one another.\"\n\nMe: \"Sure, if you apologise. You made a mistake. It was unprofessional to say what you said about me to your client. Be a man, own up to your mistake and say sorry to me, and I will forget it happened.\"\n\nTrainer: \"I am sorry.\"\n\nMe: \"Ok, now walk away.\"\n\nAt this point Trainer was shaking, either from anger over being told what to do, embarrassment or because of adrenaline from the confrontation. He walks away and I go back to my workout.\n\nI told my family that this happened and they all think I took it too far by confronting him at his place of work, by lying about the video and that I should have just ignored it. I can see that maybe the way I confronted him was not the best, AITA?", "created_utc": 1687957191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l8vq4/aita_for_confronting_a_gym_trainer_who_was/", "score": 621, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Numerous studies have proven that lifting heavy weights is beneficial to all ages. \n\nAs long as someone has the correct form, lifting heavy is great.

You were completely justified in confronting them but I think you took it too far and got a little aggressive. \n\nFor me, just knowing I called them on their shit and embarrassed then would have been enough.

You took it too far.", "NTA. I'll be honest, the fact that he actually did apologize and ask to continue to be polite to one another tempts me to say that no one is the asshole. However, the ONLY reason he apologized is because of your bluff. Hopefully he will be true to his word and not let this sour your future relationship, but I don't see that happening.

You did brought it way, way too far *for the local culture*. Chinese culture is no confrontational, and the most important is that you always try to save each other dignity.\n\nOf course the guy was shaking, you crushed him totally, what you did would be like for an european to be pissed or shitted on : THAT level of humiliation. \n\nTo speak a language without knowing and  respecting the culture and ways to relate to each other means that you are not clearly *understanding it* nor are you *talking properly*.  When the trainer told you that you two can be polite to each other, that was the best excuse and peace offering he could musters in his culture. \n\nYour level of entitlement to get the EXACT WORD you're waiting for to understand he is actually apologizing (which he already did), the way you proceed, it can come from a tyrannical king or mafia's godfather or something like that. Not from a client of a gym... \nDon't be surprised if he hate you or is scared of you and tell to others how arrogant you have been.\n\nIn my opinion, it shows to me that you probably grew up and still living sheltered in your caucasian community.

Speaking in a language he believed you did not understand made his actions all the more disrespectful. His client too it should be said.
