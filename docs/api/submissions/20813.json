In my country, it is common for non-Chinese people to not speak/understand the local Chinese dialect, relying on English as a lingua franca. However, I can both speak and understand the local Chinese dialect.\n\nI was in the gym deadlifting >180kgs. There's a gym trainer (Trainer) 5 meters behind me training an older Chinese lady. The lady asks Trainer in Chinese 'what's the point of him lifting so heavy?'\n\nTrainer replies in Chinese with: \"Nothing, his body doesn't even look good, he's young so he can do it now but he will regret it in the future. His joints and bones will hate him.\" They then both begin to talk shit about me in a contemptuous tone loudly in Chinese, all the while I'm still only 5 meters away from them.\n\nI turned around and told Trainer \"I hear you\" in Chinese, and the blood immediately drains from his face. He takes the lady away and they finish their session in another part of the gym.\n\nWhen the session is over and the lady leaves, I go up to Trainer and confront him over what he was saying, and we have the following (from memory) conversation in Chinese:\n\nMe: \"Do you have a problem? If you have a problem, you can say it to me?\"\n\nTrainer: \"No there's no problem, I was only saying good things about you, she asked what was the point, and I said its just something he enjoys and he can continue to do so whilst he's young.\"\n\nMe: \"That is not what you said. Stop lying to me. You were talking shit in Chinese thinking I don't understand you. Well, you can clearly see I understand Chinese. Apologise to me.\"\n\nTrainer: \"Why would I apologise to you when I didn't do anything wrong?\"\n\nMe: \"You have disrespected me already by saying those things, and you are disrespecting me now by lying to me. If you don't apologise I will lodge a complaint against you; I have taken a video of you saying these things, and I will show it to your boss.\"\n\nI lied, I didn't have any video. I was bluffing because I wanted him to stop bullshitting me. Fortunately, he got visibly flustered and the bluff worked.\n\nTrainer: \"Look, I don't want our relationship to be damaged. if we see each other can we still be polite to one another.\"\n\nMe: \"Sure, if you apologise. You made a mistake. It was unprofessional to say what you said about me to your client. Be a man, own up to your mistake and say sorry to me, and I will forget it happened.\"\n\nTrainer: \"I am sorry.\"\n\nMe: \"Ok, now walk away.\"\n\nAt this point Trainer was shaking, either from anger over being told what to do, embarrassment or because of adrenaline from the confrontation. He walks away and I go back to my workout.\n\nI told my family that this happened and they all think I took it too far by confronting him at his place of work, by lying about the video and that I should have just ignored it. I can see that maybe the way I confronted him was not the best, AITA?", "created_utc": 1687957191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l8vq4/aita_for_confronting_a_gym_trainer_who_was/", "score": 2251, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were completely justified in confronting them but I think you took it too far and got a little aggressive. \n\nFor me, just knowing I called them on their shit and embarrassed then would have been enough.

When the trainer told you that you two can be polite to each other, that was the best excuse and peace offering he could musters in his culture. \n\nYour level of entitlement to get the EXACT WORD you're waiting for to understand he is actually apologizing (which he already did), the way you proceed, it can come from a tyrannical king or mafia's godfather or something like that. Not from a client of a gym... \nDon't be surprised if he hate you or is scared of you and tell to others how arrogant you have been.\n\nIn my opinion, it shows to me that you probably grew up and still living sheltered in your caucasian community.

(Maybe even from the early 2000s, actually.)\n\nThe very concept of **systemic** racism (often defined as \u201cpower + prejudice\u201d) was developed in the mid-late twentieth century, in sociology (a discipline which studies **systems**). The definition took a while to spread out of academia. And it was never intended to be the ONLY definition of racism.", ">white people have to deal with even if they do have to deal with occasional prejudice.  \n\n>the odd act of prejudice here or there  \n\n>it\u2019s worth noting that even if they might have experienced isolated acts of discrimination, that is very different  \n\nI don't see why it's so hard to agree that racism against anyone is bad, or why anyone has to play linguistic games to try and obscure that they are talking about racism. Here you have talked *around* racism, downplayed it, and relabelled it.  \n\nYou could make your point by saying \"systemic racism is worse because it has more weight begind it\" without avoiding the need to call invldividual racism \"racism\"", "Why is it? The OP doesn't indicate that race was a factor, but the story as-written definitely describes rudeness because OP called the trainer out about it.", "The last sentence doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with the first two\u2026.", "These are good words and and excellent points!", "The Merriam Webster dictionary defines racism this way: \u201ca belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race\u201d or \u201cthe systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of another\u201d or \u201ca political or social system founded on racism and designed to execute its principles\u201d. I don\u2019t think what you\u2019re talking about really falls under any of those categories. That\u2019s not to say that what you\u2019re talking about isn\u2019t discrimination or prejudice, and that it can\u2019t be harmful. Just that it\u2019s not the same thing and the two shouldn\u2019t be equated.", "The Oxford English dictionary:  \n\n>racism\n/\u02c8re\u026as\u026az(\u0259)m/\nnoun\nprejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.  \n\nRacism is discrimination based on race. Its as simple as that, and I don't see why people try to muddy the water by insisting otherwise.  \n\nSystemic racism is simply racism with the weight of a system or historic system behind it", "NTA - I think you handled it well. \n \nYou kept calm and (respectfully) waited until the trainer had finished the session and was alone. \n  \nYou said that you can hear them so it would stop, they either stopped or continued the conversation out of earshot. \n  \nBy saying you had a recording the trainer confessed, if they had not said anything wrong they wouldn't be worried. \n   \nYou could report it but they may only take action if there is proof, Idk if there are cameras around but as you didn't get a recording it may be pointless.\n   \nThey are both SO rude to talk about you like that, also for the trainer to keep lying to your face, grr. \nI've had a similar situation before, but it was in England, I'm English, they didn't expect me to speak French.", "I am Chinese.    Direct confrontation is not good in Chinese culture nor is asking for an apology.    Best way to have handled this situation would have been to stop your weightlifting and go to them and converse in the native dialect along these lines: \n\n\u201cI heard your comment about my bones hurting in old age.  According to western scientific papers the weights I am lifting while build bone density which will help prevent my body from stooping in old age.  I am practicing proper form while executing these lifts and will not have joint issues as any properly educated trainer would know.   By the way, just for fun, I recorded your interaction earlier.  Would you like me to share it with the owner?   Oh, of course not.   Take your time training\u201d.  Walk away.  \n\nThe above conversation spoken in the native dialect would let him and his client know that you heard the whole conversation and basically told her she hired a trainer that doesn\u2019t know his sh*t.   Both of them would have been embarrassed and not have argued with you.    \n\nFrom a western viewpoint you were NTA.    From a Chinese viewpoint, you made him lose face in the worst way possible by challenging his man hood and calling him a liar.   Still in my book you are NTA", "NTA. As a visiting Caucasian in a Chinese gym, my son was asked if they could take photos to use for advertising! He's not huge, but a nicely built, fit guy. That's a much better reaction, which he was flattered by and readily agreed. I know which I'd prefer.", "Good job!! You\u2019re awesome. Keep up this mindset. He had to be put in his place espc when he tried to continue to lie to you", "This person didn't just stand up for himself, he also saved other people, who potentially might not be speaking this language from being shit talked about.", "Deadlifting is an amazing way to build strength and prevent osteoporosis. If done correctly it will prevent the very problems you reference.", "Yeah not completely. Racism is prejudice + power. This person was in a majority-Chinese environment, and the trainer was trying to use the power of being majority culture and Chinese speaking against the white guy. That is indeed racism.", "Race as a concept is deprecated. \n\nBiology and sociology moved away from the concept of race in the twentieth century. \n\nHowever, legacy usage of the word has stuck around in terms such as racism. \n\nRacism isn't truly limited to racial groups.

Honestly I don\u2019t have time to find a 10-year-old syllabus and find the specific source we were referred to, but whether it was a dictionary or standard textbook, I think my other comments explain why this distinction could be significant and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s implausible that others commenting had been referred to similar sources at some time."]}
