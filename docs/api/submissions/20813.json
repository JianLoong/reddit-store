In my country, it is common for non-Chinese people to not speak/understand the local Chinese dialect, relying on English as a lingua franca. However, I can both speak and understand the local Chinese dialect.\n\nI was in the gym deadlifting >180kgs. There's a gym trainer (Trainer) 5 meters behind me training an older Chinese lady. The lady asks Trainer in Chinese 'what's the point of him lifting so heavy?'\n\nTrainer replies in Chinese with: \"Nothing, his body doesn't even look good, he's young so he can do it now but he will regret it in the future. His joints and bones will hate him.\" They then both begin to talk shit about me in a contemptuous tone loudly in Chinese, all the while I'm still only 5 meters away from them.\n\nI turned around and told Trainer \"I hear you\" in Chinese, and the blood immediately drains from his face. He takes the lady away and they finish their session in another part of the gym.\n\nWhen the session is over and the lady leaves, I go up to Trainer and confront him over what he was saying, and we have the following (from memory) conversation in Chinese:\n\nMe: \"Do you have a problem? If you have a problem, you can say it to me?\"\n\nTrainer: \"No there's no problem, I was only saying good things about you, she asked what was the point, and I said its just something he enjoys and he can continue to do so whilst he's young.\"\n\nMe: \"That is not what you said. Stop lying to me. You were talking shit in Chinese thinking I don't understand you. Well, you can clearly see I understand Chinese. Apologise to me.\"\n\nTrainer: \"Why would I apologise to you when I didn't do anything wrong?\"\n\nMe: \"You have disrespected me already by saying those things, and you are disrespecting me now by lying to me. If you don't apologise I will lodge a complaint against you; I have taken a video of you saying these things, and I will show it to your boss.\"\n\nI lied, I didn't have any video. I was bluffing because I wanted him to stop bullshitting me. Fortunately, he got visibly flustered and the bluff worked.\n\nTrainer: \"Look, I don't want our relationship to be damaged. if we see each other can we still be polite to one another.\"\n\nMe: \"Sure, if you apologise. You made a mistake. It was unprofessional to say what you said about me to your client. Be a man, own up to your mistake and say sorry to me, and I will forget it happened.\"\n\nTrainer: \"I am sorry.\"\n\nMe: \"Ok, now walk away.\"\n\nAt this point Trainer was shaking, either from anger over being told what to do, embarrassment or because of adrenaline from the confrontation. He walks away and I go back to my workout.\n\nI told my family that this happened and they all think I took it too far by confronting him at his place of work, by lying about the video and that I should have just ignored it. I can see that maybe the way I confronted him was not the best, AITA?", "created_utc": 1687957191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l8vq4/aita_for_confronting_a_gym_trainer_who_was/", "score": 1568, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were completely justified in confronting them but I think you took it too far and got a little aggressive. \n\nFor me, just knowing I called them on their shit and embarrassed then would have been enough.

When the trainer told you that you two can be polite to each other, that was the best excuse and peace offering he could musters in his culture. \n\nYour level of entitlement to get the EXACT WORD you're waiting for to understand he is actually apologizing (which he already did), the way you proceed, it can come from a tyrannical king or mafia's godfather or something like that. Not from a client of a gym... \nDon't be surprised if he hate you or is scared of you and tell to others how arrogant you have been.\n\nIn my opinion, it shows to me that you probably grew up and still living sheltered in your caucasian community.

He forgot you understood EVERY word he said. Priceless!\n\nYour video bit was a tad much for me. For one thing, secret cameras are forbidden on nearly all gym floors that I know of. If this trainer had his wits about him, he may have called you on  this.\n\nAnd what's this \"confronting him at his place of work\"? His place of work is a gym where you PAY to attend. You help to pay his salary, keep the lights on, etc. Where else would you have taken this trainer to task?\n\nAfter tweaking his nose linguistically, you should have spoken to the front desk in ENGLISH about the exchange.

Some Americans are pushing **hard** to make the world think systemic racism is the only form of racism. Most racism is from one individual to another individual or else an individual to a class of people. \n\nThe blatant attempt to redefine individual racism as \"bias\" or \"discrimination\" is despicable  because it is only done in order to allow members of a particular class to act like they are the only class that experiences racism, and all other racial discrimination is somehow **less than** what they experience, or else it's done in order for members of a particular class to justify their own racist actions because \"we can't be racist, because racism only counts if it is against us\".  \n\nSomehow this thought process is gaining traction, when it would be much more useful to stick to the correct course of action, which is \"all racism is bad, no matter who commits it and who it is committed against\".  \n\nIn any event this is moot in the OP because he **is** a member of the outlying race in the country he lives in, so even **systemic** racism as a definition is likely to apply in this case.  \n\nHaving said that, it doesn't sound like the trainer was actually being racist. They were speaking to another person in their own dialect, but didn't appear to actually reference OPs race at all.

I changed my major from international affairs, and learning the distinction was actually a part of my undergraduate coursework. However, when I pulled up the definition to quote it here, I saw they\u2019ve added valid definitions that don\u2019t include that qualifier. My guess is a lot of people are still working with that prior definition, where racism was only the appropriate term when it was backed by system-level oppression.", "Racism is judging someone on their skin color, you woke prole.\n\nNta at OP.", "The counter I've always had to that definition is that it makes individual people's hate and vitriol seem not as bad because it's just prejudice.

All the \u201c-isms\u201d are subcategories of prejudice, I\u2019m confused why you\u2019d think prejudice doesn\u2019t lead to violence and murder racism, homophobia, etc are forms of prejudice."]}
