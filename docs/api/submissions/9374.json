But when I was about 18, I am 26 now, got bored of saying Happy Birthday to people all the time and wanted to have a more unique way of saying Happy birthday so it would be more memorable. I now I know there are silly cards and stuff but I started trying to come up with a  new phrase to say. \n\nNow my first one was \"Happy day of being pushed out of your mom's uterus\" until I said that to someone and they told me they were a C-section baby so technically not pushed  out and I was like you know what you are right and changed it to \"Happy day of being forcefully removed from your mom's uterus\" because it's all inclusive. And since deciding on that it's what I have told everyone every year since on their birthday. \n\nNow I have mother-in-law (49) who does not really like me to begin with and she not picks everything I say and do. However even though I've been with my husband for 9 years, she apparently never noticed before today when I said that exact phrase to her oldest son, my BIL. Which really the fact that she has never noticed before in 9 years can tell you a lot about my relationship with her, in my opinion. \n\nAfter hearing this she freaked out on me, because what I said was \"Vulgar, rude, and making fun of the birthday traditions\". I personally don't see this vulgar or rude but I am not always the best at social cues so maybe I'm however no one else has ever complained or said anything before and usually it gives people a nice chuckle.  So here I am to ask, am I the asshole? Am I missing the social cues here and am in fact being vulgar and rude?\n\n\nUpdate/Edit: Hi everyone, I've read all the comments and I can see now why it was not appropriate but let me clear up a few things, I have only been married for 2 years but with my husband for 9.  We are not at a family gathering, She came to my house this morning to drop off a package that she had for my husband because sometimes they drop off his packages to her on accident because of the last name. I texted my brother in law this and she only knows that because she looked at my phone when I set it down to take the package as I literally just sent the text. I have never actually said to anyone person, just text it when I know I won't see them in person. \n\nHowever I see now that it may come off cruder than I intend. I know a lot of you mentioned truama and if I triggered anyone I am sorry. The reason I am not good at reading social cues is due to childhood truama myself and I never intended to be hurtful in what I said. I just thought it was a light joke. Thank you for all the feed back.\n\nAlso to add my Brother in law is a couple years older than me and he has them same sense of humor I do since many people have wanted to know. And when I say I say this everyone I did not mean literally just close family and friends and I am close with my brother in law I just wont see him in person today. I would not say this to a total stranger, I try my best to understand social cues but I am not great at it. However I still know better than to say this to a random person.", "created_utc": 1675787457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w64xx/aita_for_not_telling_people_happy_birthday_the/", "score": 3332, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But when I was about 18, I am 26 now, got bored of saying Happy Birthday to people all the time and wanted to have a more unique way of saying Happy birthday so it would be more memorable. I now I know there are silly cards and stuff but I started trying to come up with a  new phrase to say. \n\nNow my first one was \"Happy day of being pushed out of your mom's uterus\" until I said that to someone and they told me they were a C-section baby so technically not pushed  out and I was like you know what you are right and changed it to \"Happy day of being forcefully removed from your mom's uterus\" because it's all inclusive. And since deciding on that it's what I have told everyone every year since on their birthday. \n\nNow I have mother-in-law (49) who does not really like me to begin with and she not picks everything I say and do. However even though I've been with my husband for 9 years, she apparently never noticed before today when I said that exact phrase to her oldest son, my BIL. Which really the fact that she has never noticed before in 9 years can tell you a lot about my relationship with her, in my opinion. \n\nAfter hearing this she freaked out on me, because what I said was \"Vulgar, rude, and making fun of the birthday traditions\". I personally don't see this vulgar or rude but I am not always the best at social cues so maybe I'm however no one else has ever complained or said anything before and usually it gives people a nice chuckle.  So here I am to ask, am I the asshole? Am I missing the social cues here and am in fact being vulgar and rude?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
