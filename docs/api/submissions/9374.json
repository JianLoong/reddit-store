But when I was about 18, I am 26 now, got bored of saying Happy Birthday to people all the time and wanted to have a more unique way of saying Happy birthday so it would be more memorable. I now I know there are silly cards and stuff but I started trying to come up with a  new phrase to say. \n\nNow my first one was \"Happy day of being pushed out of your mom's uterus\" until I said that to someone and they told me they were a C-section baby so technically not pushed  out and I was like you know what you are right and changed it to \"Happy day of being forcefully removed from your mom's uterus\" because it's all inclusive. And since deciding on that it's what I have told everyone every year since on their birthday. \n\nNow I have mother-in-law (49) who does not really like me to begin with and she not picks everything I say and do. However even though I've been with my husband for 9 years, she apparently never noticed before today when I said that exact phrase to her oldest son, my BIL. Which really the fact that she has never noticed before in 9 years can tell you a lot about my relationship with her, in my opinion. \n\nAfter hearing this she freaked out on me, because what I said was \"Vulgar, rude, and making fun of the birthday traditions\". I personally don't see this vulgar or rude but I am not always the best at social cues so maybe I'm however no one else has ever complained or said anything before and usually it gives people a nice chuckle.  So here I am to ask, am I the asshole? Am I missing the social cues here and am in fact being vulgar and rude?\n\n\nUpdate/Edit: Hi everyone, I've read all the comments and I can see now why it was not appropriate but let me clear up a few things, I have only been married for 2 years but with my husband for 9.  We are not at a family gathering, She came to my house this morning to drop off a package that she had for my husband because sometimes they drop off his packages to her on accident because of the last name. I texted my brother in law this and she only knows that because she looked at my phone when I set it down to take the package as I literally just sent the text. I have never actually said to anyone person, just text it when I know I won't see them in person. \n\nHowever I see now that it may come off cruder than I intend. I know a lot of you mentioned truama and if I triggered anyone I am sorry. The reason I am not good at reading social cues is due to childhood truama myself and I never intended to be hurtful in what I said. I just thought it was a light joke. Thank you for all the feed back.\n\nAlso to add my Brother in law is a couple years older than me and he has them same sense of humor I do since many people have wanted to know. And when I say I say this everyone I did not mean literally just close family and friends and I am close with my brother in law I just wont see him in person today. I would not say this to a total stranger, I try my best to understand social cues but I am not great at it. However I still know better than to say this to a random person.", "created_utc": 1675787457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w64xx/aita_for_not_telling_people_happy_birthday_the/", "score": 382, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But when I was about 18, I am 26 now, got bored of saying Happy Birthday to people all the time and wanted to have a more unique way of saying Happy birthday so it would be more memorable. I now I know there are silly cards and stuff but I started trying to come up with a  new phrase to say. \n\nNow my first one was \"Happy day of being pushed out of your mom's uterus\" until I said that to someone and they told me they were a C-section baby so technically not pushed  out and I was like you know what you are right and changed it to \"Happy day of being forcefully removed from your mom's uterus\" because it's all inclusive. And since deciding on that it's what I have told everyone every year since on their birthday. \n\nNow I have mother-in-law (49) who does not really like me to begin with and she not picks everything I say and do. However even though I've been with my husband for 9 years, she apparently never noticed before today when I said that exact phrase to her oldest son, my BIL. Which really the fact that she has never noticed before in 9 years can tell you a lot about my relationship with her, in my opinion. \n\nAfter hearing this she freaked out on me, because what I said was \"Vulgar, rude, and making fun of the birthday traditions\". I personally don't see this vulgar or rude but I am not always the best at social cues so maybe I'm however no one else has ever complained or said anything before and usually it gives people a nice chuckle.  So here I am to ask, am I the asshole? Am I missing the social cues here and am in fact being vulgar and rude?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is a completely unrelated excuse and if she did in fact go through trauma as a child, it should make her more conscious about what she conveys to others, regardless of the specific type of trauma experience.", "Yeah I have a feeling that if she ever does get pregnant, she\u2019s going to realize very quickly how horrifying dense she was for saying this to people.", "\"manic pixie dream girl\" refers to a particular literary trope about overly quirky female characters written for male fulfillment, you should look it up.", "rawr means i luv u", "SPLORK! thats a two sided spork i came up with hehehe.", "Yup, it comes off as wanting to make someone else\u2019s event about her.  It reeks of desperation and a need to be the center of attention.", "When you give someone a gift, do you not want it to be memorable? Same with greetings.  I personally appreciate someone taking the time to make a memorable greeting, much more than a boring \"happy birthday\". \n\nI would prefer to get a chuckle out of a greeting than just \"oh thanks!\"", "To add to this, it\u2019s not the word itself but more so childbirth can be incredibly traumatic for women or even their partners that are present during birth. Especially the added \u201cforcefully removed\u201d is just way over the top and totally unnecessary. I agree MIL maybe be overreacting? But someone had to say something about this just not being okay. I\u2019m sure other people in OPs life have been uncomfortable to a degree when OP texts them this. YTA OP for trying to make yourself seem fun and different on other people\u2019s birthdays and also being slightly offensive in the process.", "I mean, I read it and went, \u201cyup, reasonably accurate description of birthing.\u201d I just don\u2019t understand the overreaction. As far as who it\u2019s fit, I\u2019d limit myself to avoid repetition, but jokes are for the listener (if they laugh).", "I fully accepted I was the asshole here and said that? However I feel like me explaining myself didn't make me look like less of an asshole and just clarified information for people that kept asking so I didn't have to comment a lot.", "Yes, I understand idioms. But the text was sent to the BIL, who OP says she is close with and would find the joke funny. It was not said out loud. It was a private text, that MIL had no business reading and making a big deal over. Thus, there was no idiomatic room to be read in this case. Again, in general I agree with the sentiment, but this was a private text between two people that a third party inserted herself into without consent.", "Maybe, but when it bombs it bombs.", "I use \"Happy hatching day\" with some friends", "Happy solar return!", "Lol this one is cute.\n\nOP's word choice is just cringe.", "I like this!", "I like this one.", "Yep, it's just not ringing true.", "I guess I learned something new today! Sorry for getting defensive. I'm newly diagnosed bipolar and am a little sensitive sometimes.", "This is the impression that I got. That other people\u2019s birthdays are not as important to OP as lamely trying to make herself seem \u201cedgy, different, and interesting.\u201d At the cost of other people\u2019s feelings? That\u2019s not interesting, that is just sad.", "When you give a gift to someone you typically give them something they will enjoy, not something that the giver alone likes.", "You said your MIL hadn't noticed you said it in 9 years and then you said you only texted it. Gtfo of here", "Merry birthmas", "My personal favorite!", "It (OP's) sounds so forced. Too long, does not roll off the tongue.\n\nThere are some good ones in this thread, there's no need to insert body parts/ internal organs into something that's meant to celebrate another person's special day...", "Right?! From the title I was thinking \"How bad could it be?\"\n\nSpoilers; it was that bad... imagine deciding on that as your quirky way to say Happy Birthday...", "Hence why i asked in my comment whether the BIL had a similar sense of humor. The person who was offended literally read a text not meant for her.  If the BIL had asimilar sense of humor, i dont see how a dirty joke makes OP an asshole.", "Because they apparently do this for everyone they have said Happy Birthday to in the last 8 years.  It would be one thing for them to say this to only people OP knows will find this humor funny but that is not what is happening.  They are doing it to be \"edgy\" and so that people remember them, not to make the person laugh.  It is entirely for selfish reasons."]}
