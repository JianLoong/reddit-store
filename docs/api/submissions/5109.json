So my (25F) bf (26M) recently moved to a new city. At the time I was 6mos pregnant and we have a 1 year old. Before we moved, we agreed I would stay at home and take care of our child and to not strain myself too much with the baby on the way (doctor said I was high risk). Let\u2019s also note that my bf works overnight. Well one particular evening was hard for me since our 1yo was being extra fussy so I wasn\u2019t able to put her to sleep until  almost 2 am and coincidently my bf calls me about an hour later saying his female coworker was leaving work early and didn\u2019t have a ride home and asked if I could take her home. Now, I told him no for the following reasons: 1. I don\u2019t know her, he\u2019s never mentioned her, and for past reasons, I don\u2019t trust strangers. Male or female. And 2. I had JUST put our daughter to sleep, I wasn\u2019t about to wake her up for someone I don\u2019t know. \nWell, he blew up on me saying \u201cthis is why bad shit happens to you all the time, and it\u2019s not like you work so you can sleep all day, why can\u2019t you help a stranger out so you can get good karma\u201d along with other colorful things about how im a bad person. \nPersonally I don\u2019t think im in the wrong for not wanting to get up in the middle of the night with our daughter just to take a stranger home. IN A NEW CITY. \n\nSide note: we have one car, and I had the car so my bf wouldn\u2019t have been able to take her home if he wanted. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1671432527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpkgrd/aita_for_not_giving_my_bfs_female_coworker_a_ride/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one I know would even ask someone with a little kid to wake the kids in the middle of the night for literally anything short of life or death.", "NTA but your bf is. Why come up with so much drama over a co worker? Also its 3am and who in their right mind wakes up a pregnant lady with a 1 year old asking if she can drink a co worker home? Was he expecting you to put the baby in the back of the car and head out to help some random person? Isn't there what's called a taxi in the part of the country you live in? You should have told him to f\\*ck off as you are super tired and couldn't give a rats ass about some random person you don't give a shit about. The crap about karma is just bs or else many a bad people should be dead and buried by now but they all seem to thrive. Look after yourself and your little one.", "NTA \n\nI wonder what\u2019s going on there when your partner thinks a ride home for a coworker is more important than the well-being of his family.\n\nYour daughter was sleeping, it was in the middle of the night and you didn\u2019t even know that person. Even if you hadn\u2019t been pregnant and your daughter wasn\u2019t sleeping, this request in the middle of the night seems odd to me.", "Hmm, I wonder why he would blow up over you not dropping everything to \u201c*help a stranger out*\u201d.

She has a job and a life and should be able to take care of her own transportation needs. \n\nThat your boyfriend saw fit to berate you for saying no is what concerns me most. How often does he do this kind of thing with you? Are you sure this is how you want to be treated -- how you want your kids to be treated -- for the rest of your life? You deserve a lot more respect than what he's showing you. A. LOT. MORE.", "While I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a bad person as your bf said, this certainly doesn\u2019t make you one.

It's the employer's responsibility, not yours.", "NTA\n\nStay safe, OP", "I don't see how caring for 1 yr old is in anyway easy on your physical health during high risk pregnancy, like they can be fussy as you say. But, indeed if you had to work and care for the 1 yr old while in high risk pregnancy... Well that would have been over the top indeed.\n\nI don't see how the dad can imagine that waking you up at 3 am can be in any way caring during a high risk pregnancy. Whatever is the time you could go to bed...\n\nI don't see how he imagines someone (pregnant or not) can sleep whenever she wants when in charge of a 1yr old. At best, it would be when this 1yr old needs a nap... I mean at best!\n\nHe is imagining it because he is not involved and thinks that bringing money home makes him a parent. (Well, he can do that from afar.)\n\nHigh risk pregnancy in a new city, I guess you did not have a good support system besides him. \n\nThe fact that you have trust issue is not much of a point. \nIf the fact that you are the vessel that bring life to earth does not already sounds enough as for karma considerations, there is a major issue with this guy... Supposedly dad.\n\nNTA... He is... Massively", "NTA- this is a clear indication he thinks more of his co worker than he does you\u2026", "NTA. What is wrong with him?? How is you and your baby's sleep less important than a co-worker? Were you gonna pick him up? I don't think its too much to ask for if it was arranged that you pick him up and drop the co-worker on the way. But that outburst from him was not necessary.\n\nHow did he even know you were awake?", "NTA. Does your bf not care about his 1yo daughter's sleep? The coworker can figure out her own ride or uber, not be the reason to wake a pregnant woman - a stranger - with a baby at 3am!", "NTA\u2026 and it\u2019s concerning that he thinks it\u2019s appropriate for you to wake up your one year old in the middle of the night to drive someone home\u2026 she could call a cab or Uber.", "NTA. You just put your baby to sleep and it was 3am. I would consider you an asshole if you were already picking your boyfriend up, but you would have had to wake your baby up at 3am and go out of your way to pick up and drop off a stranger, and then pick your boyfriend up later. How does he think this is reasonable?", "Oh my god, yikes. NTA, and honestly, run. Blowing up because you're not helping a female stranger- or at least, a stranger to you- is a huge red flag.", "That's an awful fierce response on a pregnant mate with a toddler on the apron strings. Hiring out a ride share would make more sense, or coworker simply waiting the hour for him to get off shift.  I'm saying NTA here. Question: with one car, do you drop off and pick up, or does he get to work some other easy?", "She couldn\u2019t have called for an Uber??", "NTA\n\nAsking anyone to get up at 2am just to give a ride to a stranger I would consider completely absurd. If someone I knew woke me up for that they had better have a very, very good reason for it.\n\nIn fact, asking someone to get up at 2am to come and give the caller a ride I would consider an asshole move without a very good reason.\n\nAsking a pregnant woman with a small child to do that is completely inexcusable outside of a true emergency.", "NTA are there no Ubers or taxis?", "NTA", "NTA but your bf\u2019s reaction and view of you is alarming!", "NTA. This entire situation is insane,  no matter the sex of the coworker it was the middle of the night, you have a toddler. If it was an emergency I might feel differently. Also, his reaction screams mental abuse.", "YTA. Damn paranoia.", "I love how the boyfriend says she does nothing but sleep all day like a 1 yo is independent & doesn't need OP to look after them. Chick is pregnant AND taking care of a toddler all by herself at night; she's lucky IF she can get sleep.", "see, I thought it was a dirty little secret too but I met her later at a company party and she is a whole stud. and he used to always blow up on me for not helping strangers out and to leave things alone but I can\u2019t help that I\u2019m paranoid! Especially with our child and we\u2019re from a not so great city. He\u2019s just not scared because he knows how to handle a bad situation if things go left", "He wants to fuck the coworker and thinks forcing his pregnant girlfriend to play taxi will help with that.", "Strongly agree, especially in this case. I\u2019ve seen too much crap happen in life to ever agree to be financially dependent on someone if I can help it. For example, the breadwinner dies, loses their job, becomes seriously ill, becomes financially abusive, etc.", "I see. In that case, you should have told him to stfu and take off of work himself to give her a ride if it was that important to him lol", "If by stud, are you referring to a woman who dress masculine if so... surprisingly a lot of men are sexually attracted to studs, a lot of them have had sex with studs.. i know of plenty of studs that are a.)
