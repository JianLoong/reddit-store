I try to be mindful of this because I know he can't help it, but I just don't have a solid grasp on what sets him off and what doesn't, especially because his preferences always seem to change.\n\nHe describes this behavior as \"cleaning,\" or when he's annoyed with me as \"cleaning up after me,\" although it's really nothing of the sort. It's not even really organization; the things never get moved to a designated place, they just go to wherever his whim dictates, whether that place makes sense or not. This results in me frequently losing important items like keys, bills, and things that I'm actively trying to use.\n\nI wouldn't have nearly as much of a problem with this behavior if he cleaned the house in more meaningful ways, but he doesn't.\n\nSweeping and vacuuming? All me. Dishes? All me. Dusting, cleaning the toilets and shower, any kind of cleaning that actually involves removal of filth? All me. He doesn't usually see me clean because I strongly prefer cleaning when he's out (I work from home, he commutes), but it really should be obvious how much that I contribute.\n\nBut that's not how he views things. A couple days ago, as he was doing one of his \"cleaning\" sessions, he started berating me about \"never doing anything to keep the place clean,\" and that he \"cleans up after me all goddamn day.\" This set me off because I had just spent a long time earlier that day painstakingly scrubbing every inch of the master bathroom toilet.\n\nI said that I had a hugely disproportionate housekeeping workload and that his habit doesn't count as \"cleaning\" to anyone but him, that the house would be a sty if he was the only one taking care of it, and that he needs to actually start contributing to housework instead of just shuffling stuff around and making me lose my things.\n\nEver since that argument he's been very short with me and avoiding me. Was I in the wrong here?\n\nEdit: He was diagnosed in his early 20's, before we met. I'm not willing to give too much detail about his experience that made him distrusting of mental health professionals, but it was a very traumatic experience which involved a boundary-violating therapist who used extremely abusive methods.

All he would do was move things around when he was cleaning, and it was an every day occurrence. I would lose things, and he would swear he wouldn\u2019t touch them but he would just move it to different spots. I think really what needs to happen is some professional intervention for his OCD. Whether that be therapy or medication or whatever other outlets makes sense for him because otherwise it won\u2019t change no matter how many times you talk to him about it and the more you talk to him the more he\u2019s gonna get frustrated. Hang in there!", "NTA. It sounds like there's two issues: he isn't appreciating your labor, and you think his labor is genuinely unhelpful.\n\nFor the first issue, you two need to sit down and divide up chores intentionally. You're not satisfied with how much housework you're doing, and he's not satisfied with it either, so once you two are calm, it should be a conversation that you both want to have. \n\nI live with 2 people with OCD, and here's how we do it: \n\n1. We start by communicating our standards. What does a clean and uncluttered house look like? What are our \"rules\" that might not be common sense to other people (for example, I believe that knives should be handwashed instead of going in the dishwasher)?\n2. We build a list of things that we agree need to happen (not talking yet about who will do them)\n3. We divide the list into daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly chores based on how often we think things need to happen\n4. We start claiming things, and fully divide each list (the dailies, weeklies, etc) between different people. \n5. We come up with a system for how we'll communicate that chores are done - checklist on the fridge, group chat texts, etc. We also designate when a week starts and ends, for clarity - so if we all agree a week ends on Sunday at midnight, then it's a problem if it's Monday and a chore hasn't been done.\n\nThere's a new app I've heard about called Community Star that can also help with this process of dividing and tracking household labor. \n\nThat would help with your issue... but then there's the \"decluttering\" activity he does. I understand the instinct of wantiing surfaces to be clear, and that can be useful labor sometimes. Maybe you could get some storage cubbies for different kinds of items, and one of his chores can be to put things away in the cubbies? As long as there's one with your name on it, or one for bills, etc, you should be able to easily find the things you're looking for. \n\nGood luck, OP, and let us know how it goes!", "NTA.\n\nCleaning and tidying are seperate categories. What he's doing might be tidying, but it isn't cleaning. And cleaning and hygiene are far more important to the health of the people in a home than tidying is. \n\n>I said that I had a hugely disproportionate housekeeping workload and that his habit doesn't count as \"cleaning\" to anyone but him, that the house would be a sty if he was the only one taking care of it, and that he needs to actually start contributing to housework instead of just shuffling stuff around and making me lose my things.\n\nGood for you.

Stop cleaning, and let him see what you're bringing to the table", "There is a difference between tidying and cleaning. He is tidying. Not cleaning. Use this language to help.\n\nAlso OCD is a really awful thing people live with, not a habit. Is he diagnosed?", "Honestly I'd write a list of all the cleaning you've mentioned and sit down with your husband and ask him when the last time he did any of them tasks. NTA, I'd be furious too.", "Nope NTA\n\nTheres a difference between 'organizing' and 'Cleaning'. \n\nHave you tried making a chore list to divide the cleaning chores equitably? That way, when your chores are done, and his arent, maybe he will have an easier time of understanding that what he doesnt isnt cleaning.", "NTA is he getting therapy for it?\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if my partner has it. It\u2019s another if he\u2019s being an ass about it. I would demand that he gets therapy. I can only imagine it will get worse.", "NTA. His OCD explains why he moves things around but it doesn\u2019t cover for the fact that he doesn\u2019t contribute to any other housework. The fact that he\u2019s unwilling to get treatment could become a major problem for both of you.", "NTA. And I don't think his OCD comes into play in this discussion, other than to provide a reason as to why he moves things around.\n\nHe doesn't get a pass for failing to have a share of the actual cleaning. Nor does he get a pass for the way he spoke to you.  I'm no expert, but I don't think that these are a result of OCD. \n\nIf I were a spiteful person, I might suggest not cleaning for a few weeks... but that is petty behavior. \ud83d\ude0f", "NTA.  If your description is correct then what he is doing isn't cleaning or tidying. Someone moving stuff around randomly would be extremely irritating to me, especially if it's keys and bills that should always be in a specific place.\n\nThat man needs therapy.", "NTA. If he is not under a professional\u2019s care for this problem he needs to be. You\u2019re his wife, not his therapist, managing his OCD should not fall to you.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve put up with this for a long time and finally snapped. Maybe he needs that reality check. \n\nHis OCD habit of moving stuff around is almost a separate issue here. I don\u2019t see how that precludes him from also cleaning, unless his OCD makes him germaphobic. In which case I circle back to my first sentence.", "Stop cleaning for a month. My ex did made the same comment to me (he didn\u2019t have OCD) and I was so hurt by it. I stopped cleaning. Then shock, horror.

You could show him your contribution by boycotting cleaning until he comes to a fair division of labor. The only problem is you'll have to live in the mess too.

Saying \"he can't help\" it is a copout if he's doing nothing to manage his OCD. Is he in therapy and on meds? If not, he needs to be because his OCD is only getting worse and his behavior is negatively impacting you. \n\nIt's not his fault and it's not fair that he has OCD and has to manage it - that sucks and I can empathize as I'm managing things of my own. However, it's not okay to make others deal with all our baggage all the time when we're doing nothing to help solve our issues.", "NTA. Boycott.", "NTA but op you need to have a very serious conversation with him for several reasons. First, he is not appreciative of all the hard work you do around the house. Second, he doesn't seem to view his behaviour as a problem, which it is. You should establish a list of all the task that actually needs to be done around the house and maybe he will finally grasp the reality of how actually  useless he is. Not even useless, and that's my last point: the fact that he thinks that he's actively cleaning after you while he just moving stuff around  is a problem. Plus he believe that you don't do shit and it is also a huge issue and he appears to be very confrontational about it. From your post he looks like a walking red flag and I would be careful if the conversation doesn't go the right way. I really hope it's going to be fine for you up.", "Stop actually cleaning and let him see what happens", "NTA. Maybe you should stop all cleaning for a while to illustrate your point?

Is he on any stabilizing medication and does he actually take it properly?\n\nYou're NTA, and if the anger is new, it may be  because he's having an affair; treating the spouse badly to provoke the other to leave is a common ploy.

At the very least look for therapy to be able to work this out together. Neither of you is to blame, his behaviour and what he said is a stress reaction, your behaviour and what you said is as well. Learn to keep the stress low and if it does boil over, learn to not make it bigger than it is.

You are cleaning. Your post doesn\u2019t mention picking up, but I\u2019ll bet you do that as you go too. So the two of you need to sit down and make a schedule for actual cleaning so that it\u2019s shared and not all on you.

Everything else was all me (cleaning, cooking, dishes, scrubbing, organizing, shopping, paying bills, scheduling appointments, school communication, attempting to plan... oh, and my full time job, of course).\n\nSo if he had to clear away any clutter in order to vacuum, he would just pile it up someplace for me to deal with (e.g. on a chair or the bed or a corner of a table).

And the constantly changing \"rules\" that come with the compulsions! It almost destroyed our marriage while we were waiting for him to get into treatment and find strategies that work.\n\nHe does need to step up and take on the necessary work, but I'm going to be honest with you. If he's not willing to engage with treatment, this isn't likely to get better on its own. You're getting a lot of great suggestions that might work if OCD wasn't completely distorting how everything works. I totally get why  you prefer to clean while he's out because you never know what's suddenly going to be a massive issue even though it was fine yesterday with someone who has OCD.\n\nIn the end only you can decide how long you're willing to set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.

OCD treatment is miserable but he needs to do it or this will continue to get worse and worse for him, possibly for you too (you can get dragged in to his compulsions).

Of course your husband\u2019s treatment of all your work in keeping the home clean is unwarranted and unjust.  \n\nMy concern here is that what you are describing as OCD doesn\u2019t quite fit OCD.  OCD tends be be very rigid and ritualistic, not random spurts of moving things to random places.  I\u2019m not this  saying as a judgement of your TA status, rather I\u2019m concerned not only is whatever illness he has is going untreated, but that it may well be misdiagnosed.  \n\nHis refusal to seek help is causing harm to your marriage and I fear harm to himself.  He is using a past trauma as the reason for not seeking appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

Buy a key ring or a dish for the keys, and insist that all keys have to be deposited there, and the location can't change.  Tell him he HAS to give on this one.  You've given on a lot, and this is non-negotiable.\n2. Make a chart for ALL chores, and initial and date when you do things.  Ask him which chores he wants to do, and they have to be real chores like vacuuming, and not just moving stuff around.  He needs to understand the difference between true cleaning and moving stuff where he wants, which is his OCD in action.\n3. If he continues to say you do nothing, either absolutely quit doing anything to make a point, AND /OR go to counseling.\n\nIt's pretty common for people with mental health differences like OCD to make excuses to avoid counseling.  I finally told my husband he had to go to counseling and go on medication as a condition to stay married.", "Perhaps list all chores that need to be done and ask him which he is doing?

Yesterday I was being a raging bitch bc my anxiety was out of control. I was rude to my husband and he said we would just go home instead of the concert. I said I TOLD YOU MY ANXIETY IS BAD. he said I can handle your anxiety but I won\u2019t deal with you being an ass to me. Did it piss me off in the moment? HELL YEAH. was he right? Hell yeah. I\u2019m very thankful he doesn\u2019t enable certain behaviors from me. He has really helped me overcome so many challenges.", "It\u2019s classic OCD behavior. (Focusing on the wrong things, not understanding why everyone else isn\u2019t focused on those things, missing the forest for the trees, frustration with perceived imperfection.)", "OCD definitely plays a role here. The OCD considers his \"cleaning\" to be cleaning, so it does feel like cleaning to him. He probably knows logically there are other things to do, but performing compulsions/rituals  are very stressful and exhausting so that likely adds to him not doing other actual cleaning.", "Why make assumptions about something you know nothing about? This is typical of OCD.", "Oh hey someone as petty as me! I wouldn't clean for a month to prove a point. Show him what actually cleaning after you would look like.", "\u201cMan up\u201d and mental illness don\u2019t go together in the same sentence. Do you tell people with cancer or other illness to man up and just get better", ">Neither of you is to blame\n\nI'm not sure it's fair to make the husband blameless in the scenario where he doesn't participate in cleaning chores at all, but then snaps and gives attitude to OP when called out on it. If he's over 12, he should have a grasp on how dirt, grime, dust, and cleaning work. \n\nThe OCD is a separate issue that is causing the other problem (stuff getting moved and hidden), it should be treated, and he's not to be blamed for that. It doesn't excuse being a lazy pig, though", "No, but you can set boundaries for yourself. Sit down and divide up the actual cleaning so that you both have an equal amount of free time. Tell him you will no longer be listening to him berate you about \"cleaning up after you\" because it's not accurate, and you'll simply leave the room if he starts.", "No, but you don't have to stay with someone with a mental health condition they aren't managing either. That's one of my personal dealbreakers. You can't force people to get help, but you don't have to stay around to watch and get hit by the fallout of them not dealing with their condition.", "Then you need to leave because staying with someone with untreated OCD who refuses to see how his behaviour is harming you is only going to cause long-term resentment.\n\nThis is a two-card situation.\n\nYou sit him down and show him a card for a divorce-lawyer and one for a therapist. Tell him to pick one because this is unsustainable.", "Dad did this. We called it puttering. There was no cleaning. No straightening. Just shifting things around haphazardly.  \nNot cleaning. Smh\nEdit: NTA. God. $1 for every important letter dad \"cleaned\" into the trash!", "Personally, I don't know that I could stay with a partner who is choosing to not treat or manage their mental health issues.", "What was the negative experience? He sounds like his OCD is really taking over and affecting his mental stability. I\u2019m guessing OCD can and does come with additional mental issues like depression, anxiety and so on.\n\nI predict this is only going to get worse for you if he refuses or is unable to recognize all of the actual household tasks you\u2019re doing and only sees his random relocation of items as a contribution.", "That is difficult. Does he have an OCD support group, or any communities of people who know about OCD and can provide a reality check?", "Then he's choosing to not manage his OCD. You know what I'd say to a diabetic(a type 1 case that knew about  it) that lost their foot? Sucks, but should have been managing your illness. OCD is not cleaning", "That's not an excuse to not get help. \n\nEither he needs to get help and stop being so disrespectful to you or you should just leave him anf find someone better. \n\nYou really want to put up with this for the rest of your life.", "You know he can go to an MD, not a therapist for medication, correct?  (At least in the US.).", "Hear me out - could you go together? That way he might feel protected and safe from any possible abuse? He must be in mental hell, and I understand why he wouldn't want to be alone with a therapist - but if you were there, would he feel safe? He can't want to live like this.", "Mmm. Did he have a bad experience, or did he get called out on his bullshit?", "Then he values his comfort above improving himself. You deserve someone who is willing to put in the effort to improve their (and this your) life.", "Yes, you can force him but you have to be ready to leave him.  I gave my husband an ultimatum:  counseling and medication, or we were through.  I put up with it for many years and I couldn't handle it anymore.  It was affecting not just our relationship but his relationship with our grown daughters and their families.", "He needs to though, therapy for OCD is traumatic. It\u2019s kind of supposed to be. My husband has OCD, it was severe, he went through months of cognitive behavioral therapy. If you aren\u2019t familiar with this method, it involves exposure to the thing the person has anxiety over, again and again, until the anxiety begins to decrease.\n\nExample: OCD about germs? You\u2019re gonna play with dirt, lick a floor, touch the bottom of a shoe, whatever it takes to realize that nothing bad will happen, and you can overcome it. \n\nIf this is anything like what your husband went though that made him not want to go back, then he is really going to struggle getting better. This is literally the only method that is effective.", "It does if you have experience with OCD that isn't just the stereotypical media depiction.", "The reason why it's happening is a moot point if he won't get help. All those things are possible. The facts we have is he has OCD and refuses to manage it and thinks it counts as actual cleaning instead of obbssessive behaviours.\n\nBased on that, I wouldn't be staying in that relationship.", "She\u2019s talking about it like he\u2019s just being a jerk but that really is a horribly feeling to be compelled to do things.", ">\u201cMan up\u201d and mental illness don\u2019t go together in the same sentence\n\nYeah, I'll just go ahead and stop you right there before you make dumb false dichotomies and twist the narrative any further.\n\nI did not tell the mental illness guy to man up and stop having OCD tics.\n\nI did tell a mental illness guy to man up and stop pawning all of his cleaning off on his partner.  To stop blaming his mental illness (OCD) for his inability to fold laundry or empty the dishwasher.  She can't be expected to carry the load forever.\n\nSo yes, if he wants to remain a PARTNER with the OP, he needs to man up and start cleaning, or go back to living with his parents or in a support facility.  He doesn't get both.", "Man up and clean is not the same as man up and stop being mentally ill. \n\nHe should do his share of the cleaning.", "I don\u2019t like the term \u201cman up\u201d in any context but OP\u2019s partner really only has two choices: find a way to work and function around his OCD by himself (I\u2019m assuming this is the poorly worded \u201cman up\u201d) or go back into treatment. Sounds like he\u2019s vetoed the second option.", "He can still continue to enjoy his useless object shuffling but he should also start actual cleaning and stop complaining.", "And OP states he refuses to go to anymore therapy or to seek help for it. So\u2026yeah, the husband is not blameless. Many of us have mental health issues/disorders\u2026that\u2019s not an excuse to put extra work on our partners or take them for granted.", "Agreeing with this, as well as adding that he should not move your things! Especially things you\u2019re using! Either compromise that he can place your items in one specific spot or have him not touch them at all. I have OCD, but not this specific kind, but I still do everything I can not to impose it on someone else.", "I went through this with my dad who refused to treat his depression, and I have empathy for OP because I know making that decision to stop torturing yourself trying to make them help themselves and leaving the person to their own devices is extremely difficult if it\u2019s someone you love and care about. But sometimes it\u2019s the only thing left to do for your own sake.", "Diabetes is not that simple and cannot be 100% managed in everybody. Most cases of asthma can be controlled with medication but there are still people who will get very ill with a lung infection regardless of how careful they are to avoid triggers and use their inhaler; similarly there are people who might take exquisite care with their diabetes under close supervision and still have bad symptoms.\n\nEdit to add: what I'm trying to say is that 'you should take steps to treat and manage your own illnesses, especially where they affect others' is true, but it does not necessarily mean you can look at any given person and say whether or not the condition of their disease is their own 'fault.' Responsibility is necessary; blame is counterproductive.", ">Did he have a bad experience, or did he get called out on his bullshit?\n\nThat would count as a bad experience, although it sounds like something way worse happened to OP's husband. OCD is not bullshit - it's a legitimate and often debilitating mental illness. That doesn't mean people with OCD should inflict it on others, but being told it's bullshit would not be therapeutic/helpful.", "Oh I have experience. Just with the hoarding end of the OCD spectrum.", "It absolutely is, but he is ALSO being a jerk by using it as justification to not do any actual domestic labor and force her to pick up his slack *while* complaining that he's the one doing all the work for her (which is just false).\n\nIt more sounds to me like OP is willing to deal with the misplaced keys and such but is drawing a very reasonable boundary at being admonished for not doing any cleaning when she is actually doing all of the cleaning.", "the fact that he\u2019s characterizing it as \u201cdoing all the cleaning\u201d means he IS being a jerk. the fact that he doesn\u2019t do any meaningful housekeeping is separate from his compulsion to reorganize.", "I don\u2019t really feel for him considering he could see a doctor but chooses not to. Lots of people have OCD and it\u2019s hard to live with, but if you aren\u2019t willing to get help then you kinda deserve what happens.", "Bro you realize the behaviors you describe are all symptoms of mental illness. You\u2019re trying to seperate them like he has OCD actions and non ones when he\u2019s always afflicted by OCD. She and you don\u2019t seem to have that understanding, if he doesn\u2019t want to go to therapy about it then i can understand her not wanting to be with him but don\u2019t act like it\u2019s just something he can turn on and fix", "Mental illness makes people not even bathe themselves, as a matter of fact not cleaning is a pretty common side effect of mental illness.", "I completely missed this part, which indeed changes it all. A diagnosis can never excuse being an asshole, and not searching help for it if it's actively damaging is really bad.", "Yeah I was gonna suggest that too. Tell him he can shuffle around his own stuff to his heart\u2019s content but he needs to leave her keys and important documents alone.", "I've been through it too. It's why it's now a blanket dealbreaker. Walking away is the only thing you can do if they don't want to help themselves. Or stay and burn along with them.", "Op also says that he never sees her clean, like ever because she does it by herself and then does not tell him about it. To him it very well may look like she doesn\u2019t clean.", "She mentions in her post that he never sees her clean because she does it when he\u2019s gone.", ">don\u2019t act like it\u2019s just something he can turn on and fix\n\nLast reply from me.\n\nI'm not telling him to turn off his tics.  I'm not telling him to turn off his OCD.\n\nI'm telling him to stop using it as a crutch for being a poor partner.  For not doing the dishes or laundry.  If he can't, then he's going to be on his own, really quick.  I've lived with someone with mental illness for decades.  I am very empathetic and supportive to a point.  I'm also immune to excuses for not doing the damn dishes.", "Does it also make people say they are the only one doing the cleaning when in fact they do no cleaning?\n\nHe has OCD not depression.", "Set a room or closet as an office for your important things. He must stay out and not touch.", "Does he think the dishes and laundry do themselves? Or that his toilet magically never needs to be scrubbed? Who does he think vacuums/mops the floors? Are you seriously trying to say that OP is to blame for him constantly chastising her because she isn't shoving her labor in his face to demand acknowledgement?", "He's not living in a Disney castle where the furniture does all the chores while he's away. Who does he think is cleaning the toilets and vacuuming the floors?", "so does he think the dishes are just cleaning themselves? does he think they own a self-cleaning toilet? that\u2019s next-level oblivious. he\u2019s not a baby who hasn\u2019t developed object permanence, he\u2019s a grown ass man.", "How do you know that?", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xzea5/aita_for_saying_that_husbands_ocd_habit_doesnt/k35yifg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3", "I assume the OCD has him thinking that his tidying is what\u2019s cleaning up the place.

He\u2019s off meds and seems to have had a traumatic experience with therapists.", "That doesn't absolve him of anything? If he is deluded into thinking that organizing OP's documents and keys is scrubbing shit stains off the toilet then he is extra an AH for refusing to pursue any kind of management for his apparently very extreme mental illness. OCD doesn't make you an idiot.\n\nHowever, men refusing to acknowledge the domestic contributions of women and elevating their own minimal contribution is certainly not a problem unique to neurodivergent people. Mental illnesses can provide an explanation and a direction through which to seek help to remedy the issue, but they're not a shield to weaponize against the people you are hurting as an excuse for why you refuse to better yourself. Performing his tidying routine is not the problem here, it's him being an active asshole to OP repeatedly that is the problem.", "Then it would be great for him to see how clean his apartment is after OP divorces him...", "do you think OCD makes people stupid? because that\u2019s certainly what you\u2019re implying.", "Honest answer as somebody with mental illness? Yes a bit, clouds your judgement hyperfocuses you on unimportant things and makes you unreasonable. All attributes shared with naturally stupid people.", "It can make you hyper focus on faults and not recognize things that are happening around you. This has nothing to do with IQ but mental illness can and often does influence our perception of reality.", "Unreasonable enough to think your cleaning routine which never physically enters the bathroom or involves touching the dishes cleaned the bathroom and washed the dishes?"]}
