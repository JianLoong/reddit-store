It's not even really organization; the things never get moved to a designated place, they just go to wherever his whim dictates, whether that place makes sense or not. This results in me frequently losing important items like keys, bills, and things that I'm actively trying to use.\n\nI wouldn't have nearly as much of a problem with this behavior if he cleaned the house in more meaningful ways, but he doesn't.\n\nSweeping and vacuuming? All me. Dishes? All me. Dusting, cleaning the toilets and shower, any kind of cleaning that actually involves removal of filth? All me. He doesn't usually see me clean because I strongly prefer cleaning when he's out (I work from home, he commutes), but it really should be obvious how much that I contribute.\n\nBut that's not how he views things. A couple days ago, as he was doing one of his \"cleaning\" sessions, he started berating me about \"never doing anything to keep the place clean,\" and that he \"cleans up after me all goddamn day.\" This set me off because I had just spent a long time earlier that day painstakingly scrubbing every inch of the master bathroom toilet.\n\nI said that I had a hugely disproportionate housekeeping workload and that his habit doesn't count as \"cleaning\" to anyone but him, that the house would be a sty if he was the only one taking care of it, and that he needs to actually start contributing to housework instead of just shuffling stuff around and making me lose my things.\n\nEver since that argument he's been very short with me and avoiding me. Was I in the wrong here?\n\nEdit: He was diagnosed in his early 20's, before we met. I'm not willing to give too much detail about his experience that made him distrusting of mental health professionals, but it was a very traumatic experience which involved a boundary-violating therapist who used extremely abusive methods.

All he would do was move things around when he was cleaning, and it was an every day occurrence. I would lose things, and he would swear he wouldn\u2019t touch them but he would just move it to different spots. I think really what needs to happen is some professional intervention for his OCD. Whether that be therapy or medication or whatever other outlets makes sense for him because otherwise it won\u2019t change no matter how many times you talk to him about it and the more you talk to him the more he\u2019s gonna get frustrated. Hang in there!", "NTA. It sounds like there's two issues: he isn't appreciating your labor, and you think his labor is genuinely unhelpful.\n\nFor the first issue, you two need to sit down and divide up chores intentionally. You're not satisfied with how much housework you're doing, and he's not satisfied with it either, so once you two are calm, it should be a conversation that you both want to have. \n\nI live with 2 people with OCD, and here's how we do it: \n\n1. We start by communicating our standards. What does a clean and uncluttered house look like? What are our \"rules\" that might not be common sense to other people (for example, I believe that knives should be handwashed instead of going in the dishwasher)?\n2. We build a list of things that we agree need to happen (not talking yet about who will do them)\n3. We divide the list into daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly chores based on how often we think things need to happen\n4. We start claiming things, and fully divide each list (the dailies, weeklies, etc) between different people. \n5. We come up with a system for how we'll communicate that chores are done - checklist on the fridge, group chat texts, etc. We also designate when a week starts and ends, for clarity - so if we all agree a week ends on Sunday at midnight, then it's a problem if it's Monday and a chore hasn't been done.\n\nThere's a new app I've heard about called Community Star that can also help with this process of dividing and tracking household labor. \n\nThat would help with your issue... but then there's the \"decluttering\" activity he does. I understand the instinct of wantiing surfaces to be clear, and that can be useful labor sometimes. Maybe you could get some storage cubbies for different kinds of items, and one of his chores can be to put things away in the cubbies? As long as there's one with your name on it, or one for bills, etc, you should be able to easily find the things you're looking for. \n\nGood luck, OP, and let us know how it goes!", "NTA.\n\nCleaning and tidying are seperate categories. What he's doing might be tidying, but it isn't cleaning. And cleaning and hygiene are far more important to the health of the people in a home than tidying is. \n\n>I said that I had a hugely disproportionate housekeeping workload and that his habit doesn't count as \"cleaning\" to anyone but him, that the house would be a sty if he was the only one taking care of it, and that he needs to actually start contributing to housework instead of just shuffling stuff around and making me lose my things.\n\nGood for you. Because you are right. His tidying is definitely not cleaning and you shouldn't be the only one cleaning.", "NTA. Stop cleaning, and let him see what you're bringing to the table", "There is a difference between tidying and cleaning. He is tidying. Not cleaning. Use this language to help.\n\nAlso OCD is a really awful thing people live with, not a habit. Is he diagnosed?", "Honestly I'd write a list of all the cleaning you've mentioned and sit down with your husband and ask him when the last time he did any of them tasks. NTA, I'd be furious too.", "Nope NTA\n\nTheres a difference between 'organizing' and 'Cleaning'.\n\nHave you tried making a chore list to divide the cleaning chores equitably? That way, when your chores are done, and his arent, maybe he will have an easier time of understanding that what he does isnt cleaning.", "NTA is he getting therapy for it?\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if my partner has it. It\u2019s another if he\u2019s being an ass about it. I would demand that he gets therapy. I can only imagine it will get worse.", "NTA. His OCD explains why he moves things around but it doesn\u2019t cover for the fact that he doesn\u2019t contribute to any other housework. The fact that he\u2019s unwilling to get treatment could become a major problem for both of you.", "NTA. And I don't think his OCD comes into play in this discussion, other than to provide a reason as to why he moves things around.\n\nHe doesn't get a pass for failing to have a share of the actual cleaning. Nor does he get a pass for the way he spoke to you.  I'm no expert, but I don't think that these are a result of OCD. \n\nIf I were a spiteful person, I might suggest not cleaning for a few weeks... but that is petty behavior. \ud83d\ude0f", "NTA.  If your description is correct then what he is doing isn't cleaning or tidying. Someone moving stuff around randomly would be extremely irritating to me, especially if it's keys and bills that should always be in a specific place.\n\nThat man needs therapy.", "NTA. If he is not under a professional\u2019s care for this problem he needs to be. You\u2019re his wife, not his therapist, managing his OCD should not fall to you.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve put up with this for a long time and finally snapped. Maybe he needs that reality check. \n\nHis OCD habit of moving stuff around is almost a separate issue here. I don\u2019t see how that precludes him from also cleaning, unless his OCD makes him germaphobic. In which case I circle back to my first sentence.", "Stop cleaning for a month. My ex did made the same comment to me (he didn\u2019t have OCD) and I was so hurt by it. I stopped cleaning. Then shock, horror. NTA.\nAnd I don\u2019t agree with some comments \u2018clean when he is there, show him what you do..\u2019.. No, F that. He is not a child, he should know by now that things don\u2019t get magically cleaned by themselves.", "NTA. Stop doing what cleaning you are doing. Let it pile up. When your husband complains, point out this is what you provide as far as cleaning your home.", "Your husband needs to get help and start ERP therapy. OCD can feel like torture but that doesn\u2019t give anyone an excuse to let their behavior affect others, and definitely doesn\u2019t excuse him berating you.", "NTA. He's trying to tidy up, not clean, but it doesn't sound like he's even doing that. He needs to be seen by a professional - you can't have important papers go missing like that.", "NTA. You could show him your contribution by boycotting cleaning until he comes to a fair division of labor. The only problem is you'll have to live in the mess too. Overall he seems like he's the one who needs to work on his contribution And his constant claims of \"cleaning up after you\" are as inappropriate as they are absurd.", "Stop cleaning and let him see what you\u2019ve been doing this whole time.\n\nNTA", "NTA stop doing everything that counts as cleaning. Just see how long it takes him to notice.", "NTA he is moving things around.\n\nMaybe it could be considered tidying, bit cleaning, no.\n\nI suggest you do as he thinks you do and stop cleaning entirely for a few days.", "NTA. Saying \"he can't help\" it is a copout if he's doing nothing to manage his OCD. Is he in therapy and on meds? If not, he needs to be because his OCD is only getting worse and his behavior is negatively impacting you. \n\nIt's not his fault and it's not fair that he has OCD and has to manage it - that sucks and I can empathize as I'm managing things of my own. However, it's not okay to make others deal with all our baggage all the time when we're doing nothing to help solve our issues.", "NTA. Boycott.", "NTA but op you need to have a very serious conversation with him for several reasons. First, he is not appreciative of all the hard work you do around the house. Second, he doesn't seem to view his behaviour as a problem, which it is. You should establish a list of all the task that actually needs to be done around the house and maybe he will finally grasp the reality of how actually  useless he is. Not even useless, and that's my last point: the fact that he thinks that he's actively cleaning after you while he just moving stuff around  is a problem. Plus he believe that you don't do shit and it is also a huge issue and he appears to be very confrontational about it. From your post he looks like a walking red flag and I would be careful if the conversation doesn't go the right way. I really hope it's going to be fine for you up.", "Stop actually cleaning and let him see what happens", "NTA. Maybe you should stop all cleaning for a while to illustrate your point?  Is he getting any help for his OCD?", "Does he do this \"cleaning\" when he's at work? Because few places would tolerate an employee like this. Is his burst of temper new, or does he have rages like this often? Is he on any stabilizing medication and does he actually take it properly?\n\nYou're NTA, and if the anger is new, it may be  because he's having an affair; treating the spouse badly to provoke the other to leave is a common ploy.

Both my partner and I have autism, and it can be confusing and hectic sometimes, and emotions can run high. This is something that he should realize himself as well, there are two people in your household, your boundaries and wishes are equally important. \n\nPlease do get professional help with this though; if he is undiagnosed, then try to get him diagnosed. At the very least look for therapy to be able to work this out together. Neither of you is to blame, his behaviour and what he said is a stress reaction, your behaviour and what you said is as well. Learn to keep the stress low and if it does boil over, learn to not make it bigger than it is. Give space, don't follow, don't argue, just give space and talk about it after everything settled down. \n\nBest of luck!", "Does he acknowledge that he does suffer from OCD?

You are cleaning. Your post doesn\u2019t mention picking up, but I\u2019ll bet you do that as you go too. So the two of you need to sit down and make a schedule for actual cleaning so that it\u2019s shared and not all on you.

Everything else was all me (cleaning, cooking, dishes, scrubbing, organizing, shopping, paying bills, scheduling appointments, school communication, attempting to plan... oh, and my full time job, of course).\n\nSo if he had to clear away any clutter in order to vacuum, he would just pile it up someplace for me to deal with (e.g. on a chair or the bed or a corner of a table). Then later he grouses and yells and says he is the \"ONLY ONE WHO EVER CLEANS AROUND HERE!\" And said that I was responsible for all the mess and clutter. Never mind that the \"clutter\" included  kids' things (\"my\" fault), pets' things (also my fault), bills that need paying (who pays them? me) and school things (who fills out all the forms and supervises homework? me) and sheet music (who does all the paperwork for the kids' lessons and supervises practice? me).", "NTA\n\nIf it's \\*so important\\* for him to move things around, get a key hook or an organizer bin of some kind to put things in.

And the constantly changing \"rules\" that come with the compulsions! It almost destroyed our marriage while we were waiting for him to get into treatment and find strategies that work.\n\nHe does need to step up and take on the necessary work, but I'm going to be honest with you. If he's not willing to engage with treatment, this isn't likely to get better on its own. You're getting a lot of great suggestions that might work if OCD wasn't completely distorting how everything works. I totally get why  you prefer to clean while he's out because you never know what's suddenly going to be a massive issue even though it was fine yesterday with someone who has OCD.\n\nIn the end only you can decide how long you're willing to set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. I will say that right around when the OCD was finally under control, he was diagnosed with cancer and looking after him through the cancer was *easier* than the OCD.", "Holy shit finally someone with the same issue i always had with my mother. She always claimed how she was the only one who cleaned, but she never fucking cleaned at all - all she ever did was move things around.  \n\n\nlike for example we had a pile of carboard in a corner for recycling, her idea of cleaning would be to take all the carboard in the pile and restack it somewhere else, usually more in the way than it was before.... then just leave it there.  she does this with everything. she'll claim she wants to take the day to clean, but then ignores everything that needs actual cleaning and just moves her junk piles into new spots.  meanwhile she never did dishes, never took the trash out etc, but in her mind all the time she spent doing this useless stuff was effort spent on cleaning.   her stacks of junk up to the cieling ar invisible to her, but a single piece of my mail in the spot where the mail goes MUST be moved immediately. everything that isnt hers is out of place.....", "NTA\n\nHe has a serious medical condition.

I know this and so I try to keep as tidy as possible to prevent as little actual cleaning.\n\nI'd sit him down and discuss treatment... even if it isn't a happy discussion. OCD treatment is miserable but he needs to do it or this will continue to get worse and worse for him, possibly for you too (you can get dragged in to his compulsions). I sympathize with you both a lot, I've been traumatized during treatment and had an awful doctor before too, but there are also wonderful ones who genuinely care.

Of course your husband\u2019s treatment of all your work in keeping the home clean is unwarranted and unjust.  \n\nMy concern here is that what you are describing as OCD doesn\u2019t quite fit OCD.  OCD tends be be very rigid and ritualistic, not random spurts of moving things to random places.  I\u2019m not this  saying as a judgement of your TA status, rather I\u2019m concerned not only is whatever illness he has is going untreated, but that it may well be misdiagnosed.  \n\nHis refusal to seek help is causing harm to your marriage and I fear harm to himself.  He is using a past trauma as the reason for not seeking appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

Buy a key ring or a dish for the keys, and insist that all keys have to be deposited there, and the location can't change.  Tell him he HAS to give on this one.  You've given on a lot, and this is non-negotiable.\n2. Make a chart for ALL chores, and initial and date when you do things.  Ask him which chores he wants to do, and they have to be real chores like vacuuming, and not just moving stuff around.  He needs to understand the difference between true cleaning and moving stuff where he wants, which is his OCD in action.\n3. If he continues to say you do nothing, either absolutely quit doing anything to make a point, AND /OR go to counseling.\n\nIt's pretty common for people with mental health differences like OCD to make excuses to avoid counseling.  I finally told my husband he had to go to counseling and go on medication as a condition to stay married.", "Perhaps list all chores that need to be done and ask him which he is doing?

For example, one husband convinced his wife that as part of her compulsion to buy strange objects she must always keep the receipt. She kind of made it part of her ritual that she tapes the receipt to the item, and then he goes and returns it to the store for her. I would not personally want to live that way, but according to him that works well enough for his life.", "OP, you either have to get him to get treatment or it will kill your relationship. \n\nI am the kid of an OCD dad and a mom who was just trying to cope. I grew up in the household that you are describing, except my dad was in treatment. It was not negotiable. He only went untreated for one summer of my life, when his psychiatrist retired and he hadn't found a new one that he liked, and it almost broke all of us. Your husband needs to get into treatment now if he wants to have a loving, supportive relationship with you. OCD is really really hard to live with, as I'm sure you know. He will burn you out, and he needs to know that, but he can't think about it rationally while he is untreated.\n\nI can tell you that one of the strategies we had to use in my house growing up was NO CLUTTER. Everything -- and I mean absolutely everything -- had to be put away in its designated spot when we were done with it. No mail on the kitchen table. No tchotchkes on shelves. No jacket draped over the back of the chair. The only way my dad could have a hope of getting his mind to calm down was when everything was put away. So to give him a chance, we put everything away. It was really hard on my mom when we were little kids and didn't understand, but as we got older and started to see why my mom was so strict about cleaning up, we all pitched in to help my dad.\n\nIt has left marks on all of us. My brother is an absolute slob because he resented having to put everything away all the time, so now he just... doesn't. My sister has piles of things all over her house because she has more stuff than she can put away -- the hardest part of Dad's OCD for her was that she loves collecting things, but she was never allowed to collect more things than she had space to put away, so now she collects with abandon and has too much stuff. And I am still obsessive about putting things away in my own space, which is my office in my house and my business, but I also have a husband and son with ADHD, so I struggle with how they manage their spaces. I am telling you this in the hope that it will help you to know that there are more people out there in your position who get it. And also I want you to know that it is normal for people who grow up with OCD family members to be scarred from that experience, because it is a disorder that causes a lot of disruption and upheaval and trauma for others.\n\nI get that your husband has trauma, and that sucks. But my hope for you is that he can see that his untreated disorder is harming you and your relationship with him, and that that will motivate him to give treatment another chance. Because he needs it. You need it. Without it, you will both be miserable.\n\nNTA and good luck. TA in this situation is the jerk who gave your husband an extremely negative experience the last time he tried to seek care. I hope your husband can find the care he needs and deserves.", "he knows he has a problem but won't get help? then it's all on him. NTA", "I've had therapy, but never for my probable OCD. I can still differentiate between \"things that are rational\", \"things that most people wouldn't be bothered by but are real\" and \"things that just make me feel better because brain gremlins\". \n\nI could also describe all the \"rules\" in my head, and anything that I expect other people to live by I *do* explain (ie, \"hey can we please pour chips/cracker into a bowl so we're sticking our (dubiously clean) hands into a shared foodstuff?\" Or \"thanks for offering to help with my laundry, but I'd actually prefer to be the only one who touches it\").\n\nThe situation you're living in seems pretty untenable to me. I think you guys need to have a (series of) serious conversation in a calm moment. He needs to:\n\n1) agree not to move x, y and z important items. Maybe in order to facilitate this you agree on a drawer that is yours, or a place where bills *always* go, a dish for keys, etc.\n\n2) explain how you can help him, even if it feels stupid to say it out loud. You sound very understanding. Even if the answer is \"I don't always know ahead of time, sometimes when I'm stresses my brain just changes the rules\" he needs to be able to take a breath and acknowledge the difference between his \"reorganization\" and actual cleaning and quit berating you.\n\n3) he needs to pick up more actual cleaning chores, especially if it is so lopsided that he literally doesn't realise how much you do. Going over a list/schedule might help split things up.\n\n4) he absolutely needs some sort of treatment before you have any kids (if you want them, I'm not assuming). Bringing a child into this is not fair to them. I don't think this situation is fair to you, but you get to make that choice for yourself.\n\nWhat about a mutual support group?

What makes you think it won't get even worse?\n\nedit to add: there are lots and lots of psychiatrists out there. His traumatic experience, may explain but doesn't justify his denial to get help.

It\u2019s also about him thinking he\u2019s contributing more than he is with his puttering. Maybe he needs time to reframe his puttering as a \u201cbad compulsion\u201d rather than a \u201cgood helpful thing\u201d. You may need to have a more gentle follow up discussion on why this is. \n\nThe spirit of what you said isn\u2019t wrong but it\u2019s not very nice. He also wasn\u2019t being nice. You should have communicated about your frustration earlier to prevent a conflict like this, though.\n\nIf he refuses help either through therapy or medication his symptoms may never improve. They may worsen. Are you okay with that? I accepted an ex had a condition that may never improve, but I could not accept that he would not try.", "Would he be willing to do therapy via telehealth? Like a video call? Or if you went with him for a while?\n\nI get not wanting to be in person with a provider after an awful experience, but would he feel safer if he could be at home?", "I assume then he went of his medication? Because the people with OCD I know well are all on medication to manage the compulsions. Without meds or therapy he\u2019s only going to continue to decline and in some cases it can lead to dangerous and self destructive behavior.", "\"Had a bad experience in the past\" usually means \"they tried to hold me accountable for my actions and I didn't like it\"", "I get the feeling ERP was what made him decide no more therapy. \n\nI could easily be wrong but ERP is about pushing the patients boundaries and can be traumatic especially if not done properly.", "This is a fantastic answer.\nTo help facilitate this, I highly recommend reading \"The Fair Play Method\" and getting the deck of cards that goes with it.", "My mother in law tends to throw things out when she's moving stuff around like this too, then she'd regret it later and want the thing back. She was diagnosed with ADHD a couple of years ago and has become sooo much better since getting treatment.", "I agree, but with a few caveats.\n\nMy partner had some awful experiences with therapists as a child, and so doesnt trust the profession. I had some bad experiences too, but mostly I thought it was funny and used it to troll my parents - not the same. I was still hesitant to try therapy and I legit was not traumatized by my experience. (Saw 3 different therapists as a kid. All swore everything would be confidential and then failed my test and had definitely spilled to my parents. So my parents paid for me to lie to a therapist for an hour every week. And get mcdonalds breakfasts. Lol)\n\nMy partner went through a few really hard years. Honestly, it was depression. They would not do therapy, as they were sure it wouldn't help - partly because they wouldnt feel safe with any therapist.\n\nThat being said, they put mountains of effort in on their own to work on things. Was it still bad? Oh, definitely. Did I consider a therapy ultimatum? A million times. But ultimately we figured things out, and they were able to come out of it.\n\nSo, do they need to be seeing a therapist? Ideally yes, but not necessarily. Do they need to be putting effort and time in? Absolutely yes. But the two arent the same, and some people will never feel safe in therapy.", "My family has a neurodivergent streak.

Yes it was miserable. But we had a clean house. Mine and my brother's spouses talked about the shock on their first visit. My husband went to grab a soda and open it and we all dove at him to stop him and show him how to do it \"right\". You had to take the soda and sit it in the sink, cover it with your hand and carefully slip a thumb under that hand to open it. If you didn't do that she'd clean the whole area of the kitchen up the walls and everything to make sure no tiny droplets hit anywhere. She could tell if people picked something up and put it right back seemingly in the same spot.", "OCD and depression are, in my experience, not comparable. OCD causes a lot more damage to other people than depression does. I've had partners and friends with depression. It sucks, but it's manageable. I was raised by a parent with OCD and it was not manageable without regular and sustained medication, therapy and psychiatric evaluation. I would live with a partner who was figuring out their own depression. I would run far away from someone with untreated OCD.", ">So, do they need to be seeing a therapist? Ideally yes, but not necessarily. Do they need to be putting effort and time in? Absolutely yes. But the two arent the same, and some people will never feel safe in therapy\n\nThat's a very good point, but I personally would never feel safe with a person with issues like that who wasn't in therapy due to my experiences and trauma. Which means I'd never trust them. And you can't have any kind of healthy  relationships without trust. No, for me, it's a blanket dealbreaker.", "I suffer from OCD myself (leaving the house is a constant source of stress) but it's been my observation that some people self-diagnose (or are diagnosed by well meaning loved ones), then go seeking a second opinion to confirm their own. And when the medical professional disagrees, toys go out the pram.", "I have OCD. I understand he had a terrible experience. But this is not behavior that can continue. \nA lot of people are suggesting telling him he can only move his items, and things of that nature. That\u2019s not how it works. He needs to identify triggers and find replacement behaviors. \nHe also needs to pitch in with actual cleaning, and be much more appreciative of everything you do. \nIf he will not see a specialist, he can try an app for people with OCD. They are becoming increasingly more common. \nI hope things get better for both of you.", "It depends on your awareness and the severity. With my OCD, I *mostly* perceive things in a rational way. However, that doesn't necessarily always matter. For example, I have a tendency to assume little mistakes are going to have drastic consequences. If I close a door too loudly by accident, everyone in the college is going to hate me, and my teaching contract won't be renewed, resulting in me being destitute and unable to get any other teaching job. \n\nI *know* those are irrational thoughts, but that knowledge doesn't reduce the distress they cause me. I'll still spend hours replaying the scenario over and over in my head, unable to make myself believe that I'm not going be fired for something as little as closing a door too loudly.", "\u201cIn a new 2017 publication, the World Health Organization\u2019s \u2018Depression and other common mental disorders\u2019 report, they list anxiety disorders are listed as the sixth largest contributor to non-fatal health loss globally, and appears in the top 10 causes of YLD (years lost to disability) in all WHO regions.  In this report, OCD was included with the \u2018anxiety disorders\u2019 category.\u201d", "I get that and you're completely valid for having those thoughts/ Honestly as someone with severe OCD, I wouldn't recommend it either, at least if they are going untreated. It is a very stressful disorder to deal with (both for the one who has it and those around them) and it isn't very pleasant to be around.\n\nI guess the difficult thing is you love who you love pretty involuntarily. Most with OCD are still just normal people when the OCD isn't going off in their brain, but those moments of panic are awful for you, and sometimes others.  It is very hard to watch someone you love struggle this way. And although it isn't an excuse, it is very easy to end up attacking others (with words) or ultimately manipulating them to do what to OCD wishes because you become so desperate to feel okay. I know that I do that to my mother, and although that is never my intention, my anxiety level becomes so high that I will do anything it says to make it stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, I love my friends from residential OCD treatment facilities dearly. They're some of the best people I've met and everyone is typically very empathetic with anyone struggling with mental health because we know what it is like to be controlled by a disorder that makes you do things for no reason that you don't even wanna do lol I'm very capable of maintaining normal friendships and make sure they never get roped in to my issues, I just ask that nobody touches me because I feel like that is very minimal. \n\nAlso just to add the info, OCD is thought to be something you're born with.f I remember correctly, it is a disconnect in the brain where it sends these thoughts to the emotion center instead of the logic center, thus creating the fear. That being said, not everyone always displays these behaviors and it can flare up at any moment. But when it does that, you typically end up looking backat your life and realizing you had several obsessions and compulsions... at least I know I was this way.", "I truly don't understand the husband. He must KNOW that he's never turned on a vacuum or grabbed a paper towel and cleaner or a toilet brush yet he INSISTS he is doing all the cleaning and/or cleaning up behind OP. Like...wth??? Is that level of denial part of OCD or him being an AH??? Because that is what I would ask him. \"Tell me the last time you used the vacuum\"... \"Tell me the last time you cleaned the toilet\"... \"Tell me the last time you did laundry\". Call him out on this and if he can't accept it then leave, because it won't get better. OP is doing 100% of the work and then being yelled at for it.", "I disagree. They were correcting misinformation about diabetes, which is everywhere. Type 1 & type 2 are sooooo different and there is so much misinformation out there about both. Especially in a type 1 case, it can be difficult to control. I work and nursing and the patients whose sugars spike high and then dive low out of control (baffling the doctors) are almost always type 1. Saying a type 1 diabetic lost their foot and it was their fault (keeping in mind they were born with this disease) is a pretty extreme statement. On behalf of the type 1s in my life I urge people to use more caution when discussing this topic.", "My brother in Christ you brought up diabetes", "For me, the \"threat\" of the OCD is always just that it's going to ruin my ability to enjoy things of concentrate on things unless I perform the compulsion.

I'll tell you what I told him:\n\nIt doesn't matter to me if you admit that it isn't logical!! YOU'RE STILL DOING THE THING THAT IS MAKING US ALL MISERABLE! We are not going to \"calm down\" and \"leave you alone\" until you can STOP!

You are not rational, even though you think you are.", "I had a relationship like this and I have too agree with you wholeheartedly. The way you phrased it was very wise and eloquent. Most importantly it is correct. My partner refused to use medication. He refused therapy and group therapy too. So I thought, okay I\u2019ll just go into therapy myself to establish and maintain my own boundaries. And for a while that worked. It felt like a solution. But it wasn\u2019t. Not really. The relentless boundary enforcing just became another chore. Another way I was managing his condition. He never recognized that I existed as a person outside of his mentality. You can\u2019t be the sole source of personal growth in a relationship. It doesn\u2019t work. You sort of age out if it.", "Thanks for the well wishes.\n\nI take meds which help me not be completely freaking out, but they don't cure it or anything. I've done some therapy in the past and had some positive results, but no drastic change. I'm planning on doing more therapy soon.", "Understanding that something isn't rational means that you understand what is and is not rational. Besides, I fail to see how me torturing myself quietly over needing to reread something or some shit affects you or anyone else.", "So true! OCD treatment feels very much like torture in the beginning and your brain is screaming at you to stop. It will probably throw threats at you like \"everything will get worse if you do this\" and \"you/your loved ones will die if you don't do as I say\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough I'll be honest, there are really awful therapists out there who don't know shit about OCD so you really need to seek out a specialist to deal with it. I've literally had a psychiatrist tell me I don't have OCD and I'm just crazy.... and I've had a diagnosis for years AND been across the US to seek out treatment facilities. I was like.... if the experts tell me I do, I'm pretty sure I do? My experience with her was very traumatic and an abuse of power, so idk i think it is very possible he did end up with a doctor who simply didn't know what to do for OCD. Though like you mentioned, OCD treatment can be traumatizing. It is unfortunate that that is the case, but with a good doctor, you'll come out okay in the end.", ">There are other things he can do.\n\nFor example?", "It does sound like he could have had a bad response to ERP and decided to quit therapy. ERP purposely exposes him to triggers which could easily be painted as boundary violating. \n\nWithout further information it could be the therapist did something abusive or that he did not like the treatment and decided he\u2019d rather just be OCD.", "It definitely can\u2019t be cured, unfortunately, but I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re on the right path", "It depends on what your \"some shit\" is.\n\nIn OP's case, her husband's \"some shit\" is moving things around the house with no rhyme or reason, causing her to lose important things and documents, and then yelling at her about how she doesn't appreciate all the \"work\" he does. This makes her life worse in 3 ways:\n\n1. She has to deal with the stress of not being able to find stuff, which can have real repercussions if she, for example, forgets to pay a bill or misses a jury summons because her husband \"cleaned up\" the paperwork.\n\n2. She has to do the lion's share of the actual housework and domestic load because he is running himself ragged following his compulsions and doesn't have time to do any actual work. \n\n3. She has to endure his emotional outbursts about her \"not helping\" because he can't see that the \"work\" he is doing is counterproductive.\n\nI don't know if you know what it is like to experience the emotional abuse from an OCD person pitching a fit because something you did or did not do interfered with one of their compulsions in a way that you could not predict. It is completely destabilizing and exhausting. And you can't even argue with them because none of their reasoning makes any sense.\n\nPeople with OCD don't torture themselves as quietly as they think they do, in my experience.", "OP getting therapy is a strategy to help with this particular problem (because OP can't control her husband's actions but can control her own), not to treat his OCD. Support groups would be for the husband. But yes, if OP wants to work toward a solution, that is something they should do together."]}
