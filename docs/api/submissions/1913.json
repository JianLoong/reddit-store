My dad wasn't in the picture growing up so his side was never there but my maternal grandparents (72f+77m) raised me from age 6. I was living with them up until I bought my house at 23 and cut most contact once I was fully moved out.\n\nLast week I decided to take my grandparents out to lunch at a nearby pizza place since I will be out of the country for thanksgiving and Christmas, one of the only times I will speak to them. We were talking about some changes I've made to my house when grandma mentioned that, when my grandfather inevitably passes, they have it put in some sort of legal document that I will be in charge of her care if she is unable to care for herself. She said that I shouldn't make plans to stay in my house for long, as I'll need space for her and my future kids. (I am not planning on having children)\n\nI asked her why they assumed that I would agree to her living with me when her children (47,45,40,38) are perfectly capable of housing and caring for her. She said that they housed and took care of me for 17 years of my life so me taking care of her for probably 10 shouldn't be that bad of a trade. I told them that there is no way in fresh hell that I'm taking that responsibility and they started telling me that I am heartless and cruel to turn away a family member. \n\nI paid for lunch, told them that the only place she's going if I'm in charge would be a retirement home, and left. I've since had my inbox graced with angry voicemails, emails, and a literal physical letter at my workplace from one of their kids calling me a bitch. I know I should be standing up for myself but I might've overdone it in this circumstance. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: We do NOT have a good base relationship. I have a slightly better relationship with my grandfather but even then it's questionable.\n\nEdit 2: To clear up some confusion in the comments; My mother was unable to raise me, which is why they took me. I will not go into further details on this.\n\nEdit 3: Do not DM me asking if I've considered what would've happened if they would've refused to take me in. This is not going to change my mind on not wanting to take care of them. This is also not a comparable situation.

Maybe, I don't know what your relationship has been like with them but I gather not great if you've cut most contact. \n\nWhat it sounds like your Grandma was trying to do is make you her power of attorney if your Grandfather passes away. This isn't uncommon and is actually very helpful when there are medical complications like dementia. \n\nIf your relationship with your grandparents *is* more positive than your post makes it sound, then I would talk with them about why they believe you're the right person for a PoA rather than their 4 middle age children.

So my brother, who has managed to skirt all adult responsibility because he's going to be a rock star someday, is now on the hook for their care and feeding in their remaining years. And I'm blissfully happy with that. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nand don't get in charge, as already pointed out their kids will just claim you withhold money from them. \n\nAnd your grandmother gave you one of the best arguments to say no \ud83d\ude02\n Your children, they'll be young and need all your attention while her other grandchildren will most likely be teens or older by then.", "NTA \n\nThe AH people who are DMing you trying to guilt you by asking \u201cwhat would have happened if they didn\u2019t take you in?\u201d Obviously have no idea what it means to be a caregiver. \n\nMy maternal grandmother raised me as well because my mom isn\u2019t mother maternal. Only difference is I thought my grandma and I had a great relationship until I decided to be her caregiver and move in with her. I have worked for years on my mental health and didn\u2019t realize how toxic she truly is and how enmeshed we were. It\u2019s been very triggering for me to live with her and now see and understand her toxic behaviours. It\u2019s exhausting! \n\nGood for you for standing up for self and not allowing them to make you into her caregiver. Retirement home is honestly the best place for people like that, they can all sit together and complain.", "NTA, and I\u2019m proud of you for setting a boundary. A lot of people who\u2019ve experience abuse really struggle with that, but you\u2019ve risen above that and are protecting yourself.\n\nLike you said, there are plenty of others to take her  in. Let her impose on one of the terrible people she raised. You owe these people nothing.", "Nta. You warned your grandma what will happen and you're protecting yourself from further abuse and trauma.", "NAH, you have the right to say no, but I can absolutely see why they thought you'd say yes.", "It's not such a great thing when they are abusing her in a variety of ways, which she says in comments. I suspected based on her reaction but she confirmed.", "If they were kind to her and did a half-competent job of parenting her, they would have a parent-child relationship.  The way it sounds, the grandparents treated her with the same transactional bond as she's now applying to them.  \n\nOP was just an investment they made in long-term care insurance and was loved about the same as that financial instrument.\n\nNTA.

Sometimes this is because one's own childhood was a nightmare.)", "My grandfather just moved into assisted living after having been cared for by family for a couple of years, and in many ways it\u2019s an improvement for him. A good facility can offer easier access to both medical care (they come to him), as well as social events. Yes, growing older can be scary, but living in a group home isn\u2019t necessarily the worst option. Nothing can change the fact that medically my grandfather cannot live alone anymore. That\u2019s the tragedy of the situation.

The absolute kindest thing I am capable of is sending her to a retirement home to ensure someone competent cares for her.

Whst kind effed up people gaslight someone they don't even know?!!\n\nAs far as telling your grandparents that you have no intention of taking them in and caring for them, NTA. \nYou told them the truth. From what you described, it was pretty clear you are not close to them or not on  the best of terms. They should have expected as much. Too bad if didn't make a backup plan. They have 4 kids, one or all of can do it or choose to put pay someone or place her somewhere.You are not obligated to them. Their children aren't either. Just because they put it in their will doesn't mean you can't refuse. At which point someone else is assigned.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m not sure where you are based OP, but in Australia people have to sign and agree to become Enduring Powers of Attorney. This also does not mean that they agree to house or care for them, but rather make decisions with them (or for them) as needed. \n\nSimilarly, you can\u2019t be forced into being someone\u2019s carer against your will. \n\nIf she wants to stay living in the community instead of residential care, when the time comes, she clearly needs to work on her children and not you.", "NTA. Them taking you in as a child is completely different. As a child you have no control over any planning for future eventualities. As grown ass adults they have the ability to start planning now, and it\u2019s pretty shitty of your grandmother to try to tell you how to live your life now because she expects to be able to move in with you later. Your life belongs to you and not them. If her kids are so worried about it, then they can take her in. And now that she knows that you aren\u2019t going to be in a position to accommodate what she wants, she should start working on a Plan B.

I\u2019m guessing you heard how you owed them because they took you in.  You were honest telling them what you would do if they gave you POA.  Good for you and screw the rest, let them handle it.

And reasons I won\u2019t go into, I definitely did not want to look after her when the time came. She was protesting and finally listening to the reasons why the day I stuck her into a nursing home. I felt like a b for it but I\u2019d also spent a lot of time and $$$ on therapy and anti depressant medication leading up to that and still unpacking the impact the way I was raised has had on me as an adult. Let\u2019s just say for every hour of progress I had in therapy was undone by her or family. I regret going nc but I learnt to walk away rather than put up with anything that is causing unhappiness", "I hope you get free of your grandmother soon if you aren\u2019t already.", "Toss up here.  You seem to show absolutely no gratitude for them raising you and made a point of saying that as soon as you left their house you had little contact, and that you do not have a good base relationship with your grandmother.  At face value, none of that seems enough to warrant the way you spoke to her.  However, saying things like *\"no way in fresh hell am I taking that responsibility\"* leads me to wonder whether they were abusive to you in some way, or whether they did something so horrible to you that would explain why there seems to be no love for them.  \n\nIf there is something like this in the background that you are keeping to yourself (which you are entitled to do), then it makes sense why you reacted to your grandmother's assumption that she would be living with you so harshly.  \n\nThe grandmother was way out of line to be so assumptive, and quite frankly, it's weird.  If, however, the grandparents did nothing terrible, just remember that you can decline a request or assumption, but you can do it in a way that is kind.  Tone and word choice is everything.  You could have said instead that you are grateful for all that they did for you, but you could not take on such an immense responsibility so young.  That you travel extensively and have a demanding job.  You could offer to take her to visit suitable retirement communities when that time comes and assure her that you would come to visit.  If you had maybe worded it this way, rather than sounding angry and insulted, she could have come to realize that her request was unreasonable.", "NTA.\n\nRaising a child is different than caring for an elderly adult. The child slowly gets more independent; the opposite happens with an elderly adult.\n\nYou're still quite young and could want to get married or move across the planet or something some day.", "NTA and KindaAH\u2014shoot you said you\u2019d send her to a retirement home lmao I get though they were being AH for assuming.
