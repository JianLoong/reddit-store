Well he texted me saying that he came up with a great idea that he \u201cknew I would love\u201d. Of course my mind went to a million things and I got really excited because its just heartwarming to know that he\u2019s thinking about it pretty early. And then he asks me to guess\u2026 so I do. He tells me I\u2019m never gonna guess what it is. I get even more excited. And then he says \u201cwe\u2019re going eyeglass shopping for me! I need new glasses and my insurance covers it! It\u2019ll be fun!\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t think he was being serious and unfortunately couldn\u2019t hide my facial expression when he reassured me that he was completely serious\u2026 and that was all we were doing.

I think this is a prank, because you've said that he's planned nice dates before. And honestly, his eyeglass-shopping suggestion isn't the typical misguided bad idea of romantic (like he makes a nice plan but it involves his fave restaurant, not yours); it's like, think of an activity no one enjoys and do it for a day that (for some people) is supposed to be romantic. I would put money on him having something else planned. \n\nAnd yes, you're right; in the grand scheme of things, it's a silly holiday and it's more important to be treated well all the other days than to have some big public show of affection on this particular day.", "Sounds like he's trying to surprise you.

Wait till the day comes and then find out.", "NTA but if I may offer some life advice, don't put so much emphasis on one day. What truly matters is how you treat each other every single day of the year. It's OK to be sentimental and romantic and to want that from your partner, but it doesn't mean more when it comes on a specific (consumer-centric) day.", "NTA. \n\nI would say though before you get really upset with your boyfriend, do talk to him. It could well be that he is planning something out afterwards anyways, and well, if that isn\u2019t the case, do express how you feel and see how he responds.\n\nUsually I\u2019m not the type of girl to specifically put too much importance on Valentine\u2019s Day because everyday is a special day with my partner and we don\u2019t need a holiday to signify our love for each other and we make everyday special.", "Someone who has a history of planning beautiful and thoughtful dates is just saying this to tease you. Especially when he made such a point of wanting to plan your date. My guess is that he'll follow through by going eyeglass shopping with you, and just when you think that's the date, he'll surprise you.\n\nBtw, if romance is important to you, you can also take the initiative and surprise him with something special too! If you both have decided that he'll plan the official date, use common sense and don't plan anything that might conflict, like a surprise trip or dinner reservations, but you can certainly do something special for him.

That\u2019s not even a regular date let alone a valentines date.", "Nah - YET. I doubt he's being serious, it sounds like he wants you to believe that's the plan so he can surprise you. I'd have an open and calm conversation about it though so he's clear that you would be upset if that was your date. Maybe offer to arrange something if your expectations are that high. I'm sure he'd appreciate it.\n\nEdited to add - NAH yet assuming you didn't outright tell him in the moment you were pissed off. If he goes ahead with it then he becomes a slight asshole, but also how you react could put you in asshole territory too, which is why it think it's best to clear the air before Valentines day arrives.", "NAH it's understandable. like what most Redditors commented it looks like a surprise. don't get your hopes up. I get that he's had made some nice date events before and made your expectations go up. However, in a relationship always have low expectations otherwise you'd be disappointed all the way through just be glad that you're with him. \n\nAlso, I know I said not to get your hopes up? I really hope he doesn't propose to you especially on valentines day.", "You know Valentines Day isn\u2019t for another 10 days, right? YTA for not having any patience.
