I'm not sure about all the details but from what I've gathered Bob started sleeping with Amelia because she was willing while my mom wanted to wait until marriage. My grandparents were very religious and traditionalists. \n\nMy mom was devastated and cut Bob and Amelia out of her life for years and went LC with my grandparents after they retried pushing for reconciliation after Amelia was born. Eventually, my mom met my dad and got engaged and I guess by that point she was truly over Bob because she invited him, Jane, Amelia, and their son \"Bob Jr\" (28m) to the wedding. Jane was bummed out that she couldn't be a bridesmaid or that my mom made my god sister her flower girl instead of Amelia and there was an argument. Before the wedding there was a sit down between my parents, Bob, Jane, and my maternal grandparents where my mom said that she was willing to have some type of relationship with all of them but only under the condition that they all agreed to never speak about the past again. \n\nFrom that day on me and my cousins all grew up together and never knew the truth and I thought we were all one big happy family. So I was surprised my mom wasn't as sympathetic as I thought she should be when it turned out that Bob had been cheating on my aunt multiple times with different women. They later divorced after Bob had gotten one of flings pregnant. \n\nBob moved away and barely saw my cousins but he always sent me cards, presents, and messages. I also didn't find out until later but he actually paid for my college in secret so I didn't have any debt while Amelia and Bob only got partial help from him. \n\nRecently my uncle Bob passed away and his lawyer requested that I attend the will reading and I went to more so support my cousins. I was floored when I realized that I got almost everything. That's when the secret came out and it was revealed that Bob never got over my mom, was still in love with her, and always as me as the daughter that should've been his. \n\nIt took me getting a DNA test to prove that I was my father's daughter to convince everyone that my mom never slept with Bob, and during that time my cousins and Bob's other children said some really nasty things to me. After some time had cooled off I looked at the total value of my share of around $400,000 (after fees) and agreed to just give 50% to my cousins. They weren't happy and felt that as Bob's legal children they should get EVERYTHING, wouldn't hear about accepting any less, and called me a greedy witch with a b.

But you are the one who has a relationship with them so I cant really comment on that.\n\nI suppose it comes down to which you would prefer:  $400K and people with no right to that money calling you names because they are entitled, or $0K and them being all smiley because free money.\n\nPersonally, I wouldnt compromise. The fact that they are being choosing beggars about the 50% when they are owed nothing would make me think twice about giving them a penny.

Man, this is rough. There\u2019s really no great choices here, because either you give up your entire inheritance to make these people happy, or some other choice (keep it all, give up half, etc) and they will not be happy with any of those. Ultimately, Bob has put all of you in a terrible situation. It also sounds like he\u2019s the kind of person who only wants things he can\u2019t have, because he\u2019s cheated on multiple partners and has this fantasy that your family was the perfect one he should\u2019ve had. I guarantee you if he was actually married to your mom, he would\u2019ve been a terrible husband. I don\u2019t really have advice for you here, but I wanted to commiserate with your situation.", "NTA, frankly if they aren't happy with 50% just remind them that they aren't entitled to any of it by the will,  he was in his right mind when the will was written and they can go pound sand if they don't like it.", "NTA. \n\nThe real AHs are the people who get mad at the living when the dead are the ones who decided how their possessions will be distributed.", "NTA.\n\nYou know that, whatever you do, your relationship with your cousins is over.

You can\u2019t be an ass to people and expect to get something from them.", "It sounds like your mother dodged a huge bullet by not marrying Bob and by default so did you!  I hope your father was a standup guy, because **Bob was sure a jerk**.  Can you imagine how you would feel if your dad paid for someone else's college degree while you racked up a bunch of debt because he only paid for part of your education.  Then you find out that on top of that and ignoring you for most of your growing up years, he left his entire estate to that same person, not because he was close to her and had this great bond, but because he had some weird obsession with her mother.  Your poor cousins!  I can't imagine the hurt all this caused - although their father's treatment of them must have been a source of great hurt throughout their childhood. \n\nLegally the money is yours, but you already had the huge advantage of graduating from college debt free.  If it were me, I would split the money equally between yourself and all of Bob's children.  No judgement if you don't, but I can certainly understand their being upset.", "NTA. Neither are your cousins, though. The only AH in this story is Bob. Wow, he was such a lousy person. He was a serial cheater who abandoned his wife and kids in life *and* in death. Their anger and confusion about everything in the will being left to you is totally justified. I mean, I understand that everything is *legally* yours, but morally speaking, it's pretty disingenuous of you or anyone else to feign *surprise* that his children are so very hurt and upset by his actions.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t write the will. And technically you could have kept all of it.", "NTA he obviously didn't want them to have it and maybe the way they acting shows you why. It's not nice for them that their dad chose you but that's the point HE chose you  and they don't get to override that because the feel entitled to the money. If it's not too late I wouldn't give them a penny they declined the offer and go no contact.", "NTA. How much did they get from him without you helping? Because tbh after all that hate they have for you, and all that greed (he was mine so everything should be mine mentality), I'd turn around and tell them under no legal obligation are you obligated to share a penny. You can share what you want IF you want. But tbh I wouldn't. They wouldn't be happy. You would have given them money and they would still hate you. Don't force peace. It may never exist again. \n\nTo add: not your fault your uncle picked you over his own blood for his inheritance", "NTA, why even offer 50 percent... Just follow his will.", "NTA, keep it all.", "NTA. It\u2019s generous of you to share at all. People get to choose who they leave money to in their wills. Honestly, Amelia\u2019s complaints about not being flower girl and her behavior about the will are clues as to why Bob may have made this decision. Do what you have to do, OP. Get a lawyer, maybe, but don\u2019t give in to them.", "NTA Money brings out the ugliness in people. I've been where you are, sort of.  They are not decent, you are, keep the whole thing.", "NTA - it's all yours by law and if your cousins aren't happy, they should take it up with Bob.  Anyone know a good medium?  Since they aren't happy, pull the offer and set up your own retirement, new business, new house, whatever....", "NTA, I\u2019d reconsider the offer if I were you. Don\u2019t give them a dime. None of the deserve it after the way they\u2019ve treated you", "NTA, but you\u2019re not obliged to give them a penny. While I think this was an AH move by Bob, he was entitled to give his assets to absolutely anyone. He chose you. I think you need to realize that they will only be happy if you give them the lot. Sharing it will cause bitterness and estrangement; keeping it all will cause bitterness and estrangement. No matter what, you stand to lose your cousins.

For a while there, I wasn't even sure if Bob, Jane, and OP's parents were brothers and sisters or at least related. This \"gift\" from Bob just feels as slimey as he was.

As if anyone would be just fine and dandy with their father leaving everything in his will (and such a significant amount) to someone who wasn\u2019t his actual child. \n\nBob sounds like a completely awful person who continually created chaos and left nothing but pain in his wake.
