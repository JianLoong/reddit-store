{"id": 3357, "submission_id": "z63aox", "title": "AITA For Not Agreeing To Give My Entire Inheritance My Uncle Left Me To My Cousins Who Was Their Father?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nOkay this is a bit messy but please stick with me.\n\nI (26f) have am my mom's (54f) child and only daughter to my dad who she met after breaking up with my uncle \"Bob\" (53m) who had cheated on her with my aunt \"Jane\" (51f) and was pressured into marriage by their parents finding out Jane was pregnant with my cousin \"Amelia\" (32f). I'm not sure about all the details but from what I've gathered Bob started sleeping with Jane because she was willing while my mom wanted to wait until marriage. My grandparents were very religious and traditionalists.\n\nMy mom was devastated and cut Bob and Amelia out of her life for years and went LC with my grandparents after they retried pushing for reconciliation after Amelia was born. Eventually, my mom met my dad and got engaged and I guess by that point she was truly over Bob because she invited him, Jane, Amelia, and their son \"Bob Jr\" (28m) to the wedding. Jane was bummed out that she couldn't be a bridesmaid or that my mom made my god sister her flower girl instead of Amelia and there was an argument. Before the wedding there was a sit down between my parents, Bob, Jane, and my maternal grandparents where my mom said that she was willing to have some type of relationship with all of them but only under the condition that they all agreed to never speak about the past again.\n\nFrom that day on me and my cousins all grew up together and never knew the truth and I thought we were all one big happy family. So I was surprised my mom wasn't as sympathetic as I thought she should be when it turned out that Bob had been cheating on my aunt multiple times with different women. They later divorced after Bob had gotten one of flings pregnant.\n\nBob moved away and barely saw my cousins but he always sent me cards, presents, and messages. I also didn't find out until later but he actually paid for my college in secret so I didn't have any debt while Amelia and Bob only got partial help from him.\n\nRecently my uncle Bob passed away and his lawyer requested that I attend the will reading and I went to more so support my cousins. I was floored when I realized that I got almost everything. That's when the secret came out and it was revealed that Bob never got over my mom, was still in love with her, and always as me as the daughter that should've been his.\n\nIt took me getting a DNA test to prove that I was my father's daughter to convince everyone that my mom never slept with Bob, and during that time my cousins and Bob's other children said some really nasty things to me. After some time had cooled off I looked at the total value of my share of around $400,000 (after fees) and agreed to just give 50% to my cousins. They weren't happy and felt that as Bob's legal children they should get EVERYTHING, wouldn't hear about accepting any less, and called me a greedy witch with a b. AITA?  \n\n\nEdit: Just to be clear neither my mom, dad, or I knew that Bob was the one who gave me money for college because when I was applying for stuff Bob sent me a link to an organization that a \"friend\" of his knew about that gave money for school. The place seemed legit and asked me to show my college acceptance letter along with a 300-500 word Personal Statement and a copy of my transcripts, and that I'd find out in about two weeks if I got it. After he got the stuff I sent Bob googled the average of the school I was going to go to and mailed me a check for that amount. The check was sent to a P.O. Box that I had and that's how Bob would send me the money every year.

Then you find out that on top of that and ignoring you for most of your growing up years, he left his entire estate to that same person, not because he was close to her and had this great bond, but because he had some weird obsession with her mother.  Your poor cousins!  I can't imagine the hurt all this caused - although their father's treatment of them must have been a source of great hurt throughout their childhood. \n\nLegally the money is yours, but you already had the huge advantage of graduating from college debt free.

Neither are your cousins, though. The only AH in this story is Bob. Wow, he was such a lousy person. He was a serial cheater who abandoned his wife and kids in life *and* in death.

I mean, I understand that everything is *legally* yours, but morally speaking, it's pretty disingenuous of you or anyone else to feign *surprise* that his children are so very hurt and upset by his actions.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t write the will. And technically you could have kept all of it.", "NTA he obviously didn't want them to have it and maybe the way they acting shows you why. It's not nice for them that their dad chose you but that's the point HE chose you  and they don't get to override that because the feel entitled to the money. If it's not too late I wouldn't give them a penny they declined the offer and go no contact.", "NTA. How much did they get from him without you helping? Because tbh after all that hate they have for you, and all that greed (he was mine so everything should be mine mentality), I'd turn around and tell them under no legal obligation are you obligated to share a penny. You can share what you want IF you want. But tbh I wouldn't. They wouldn't be happy. You would have given them money and they would still hate you. Don't force peace. It may never exist again. \n\nTo add: not your fault your uncle picked you over his own blood for his inheritance", "NTA, why even offer 50 percent... Just follow his will.", "NTA, keep it all.", "NTA. It\u2019s generous of you to share at all. People get to choose who they leave money to in their wills. Honestly, Amelia\u2019s complaints about not being flower girl and her behavior about the will are clues as to why Bob may have made this decision. Do what you have to do, OP. Get a lawyer, maybe, but don\u2019t give in to them.", "NTA Money brings out the ugliness in people. I've been where you are, sort of.  They are not decent, you are, keep the whole thing.", "NTA - it's all yours by law and if your cousins aren't happy, they should take it up with Bob.  Anyone know a good medium?  Since they aren't happy, pull the offer and set up your own retirement, new business, new house, whatever....", "NTA, I\u2019d reconsider the offer if I were you. Don\u2019t give them a dime. None of the deserve it after the way they\u2019ve treated you", "NTA, but you\u2019re not obliged to give them a penny. While I think this was an AH move by Bob, he was entitled to give his assets to absolutely anyone. He chose you. I think you need to realize that they will only be happy if you give them the lot.

Why did your parents allow this? Sounds like your family's moral compass is broken.", "NTA.

Did she not see how strange and inappropriate it was for an ex-uncle to be so invested in *her* daughter and to have such a close, intimate relationship with her while actively neglecting his own children?

How freaking weird.", "I do agree bob created chaos in his wake but i'm not sure if it was actively intentional (as in a developed plan) and not more who he was as a thoughtless person that did things without caring about the consequences. My personal bet is whenever he looked over at op and her mother and father he saw what could have been if he wasn't such a thoughtless ashole that cheated on op mom. Instead of what he had which was a family with a women he didn't really care about and felt forced to marry. Basically he never got over the consequence of he actions actually affecting him instead of others.\n\nBob is probably also a good example of the grass is always greener idea. Never happy with what he had in his life and always searching for something better.
