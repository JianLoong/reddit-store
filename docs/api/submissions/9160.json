I have known and worked with 2 of them for years and we have lunch together everyday (our office provides lunch). Sometimes we also go out to restaurants at our own expense instead of the company lunch or after work. We are in our mid to late 30s.\n\nRecently our company hired a 3rd software engineer for our team. She is hired in the same position as us and for the same salary range but is a lot younger, in her mid to late 20s.\n\nWe do not have lunch with her and never asked her to join, and personally I am not comfortable having her in our group as I feel like she might not like some of the things we talk about as guy talk and we would have to censor ourselves. So we just go for lunch without telling her.\n\nIt all seemed fine but on a Friday we were excitedly taking about our plans to go chill at a bar after work, and she interupted our conversation saying that she loves that bar. I just said something like yeah me, A and B were planning to go there.\n\nShe has been acting cold with us ever since. One of the other men think we should invite her but the other agrees with me. I was considering it but then she also started acusing me of being unfair in code reviews, and even got our manager involved. I do not really see the big issue as women hang out with their girlfriends all the time, the other coworkers are my friends and I see her as just a coworker.\n\nEDIT: I think I get the concensus that I am the AH. I thought she could find her own group or something but I will see if I can find a way to appologize and include her for our lunches and some after work activities. I know I mentioned her age and salary but I do not have a problem with that. She does good work and even has some useful experience we lack and need for some new plans, that was why we hired her. I will post an update to see how it goes. More than the responses the DMs congratulating me from incel types and calling the commentors soy boys and feminists has opened my eyes a bit.

It is not remotely a close question. Workplace lunches are almost never entirely about random stuff outside the work place. They are networking events, whether professionally or for collective action. By excluding a co-worker because of her sex, you are making it difficult for her to advance professionally and making it more difficult for her to work with her co-workers collectively. Including her will give her a foot in the door to network and collaborate with your group in ones and twos in other contexts (it is relatively unlikely she will join you \\*every\\* lunch). Not including her freezes her out entirely.\n\nThere is one other issue: she has worked in the position long enough to have earned the right to socialize with her same-job peers.

You're getting rined pretty hard here by me and other Redditors, but you're obviously being receptive to perspectives and new ideas and are trying to see where you have gone wrong. So fair play for that. Loads of people post in AITA and then argue pointlessly in the comments when they get a YTA - thanks for not being that person!\n\nLook, in some ways, you got really lucky working with 2 best friends for years, and so those friend/ professional lines get blurred. I really get that. I ran a company for 3 years with my best friend, and our dynamic could get MUDDLED, lol. A lunch meeting to talk about funding could turn into updates on his abusive ex real quick.... It's hard when you work with pals. Maybe you guys have been blurring friend/ work behaviour for so long it maybe didn't seem weird until now. \n\nBut consider this, as a thought experiment. New people (of any gender) coming into old dynamics tend to force us to examine ourselves. New people disrupt old patterns. They put our behaviour under the microscope. We don't worry what our *old friends* think of us as much as new friends, who we don't trust to be kind yet... does that make sense? It sounds from your comments that you actually aren't the biggest fan of the 'guy talk' - you find the jokes sort of unnecessary, and you don't participate as much in the dating chat. You even used the word embarrassed in your reply. \n\nSo... maybe it's time to try to change the 'guy talk', the source of your actual discomfort, and not try to stop women from being around it? Or male colleagues too! Imagine if an older GUY had joined the team, your friend had made a sexist joke and started swearing, new guy thought it was crass and got offended, and reported him to HR. You just don't know. \n\nBut if you're not proud of the behaviour - best to stand up to the guys.", "You seem to be picking up the idea that you're the asshole and that you aren't being inclusive.  That's good.  Let me just point out that it doesn't matter if it's about age, gender, race, sexual identity, politics, or even favorite video game.  At work, especially if you work in a very small group, you adapt the group dynamics to be inclusive and comfortable for everyone.  This doesn't even only apply to work.  Whenever you have a group that's spending a lot of time together, any socializing you do in that space should be friendly to that space.  There's always plenty to talk about that won't offend.
