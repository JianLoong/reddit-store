I was driving and my wife was in passenger seat while SIL and her bf were in back. He made a couple of jokes on my expense and used degrading language towards me(all of them are of same ethnicity and I'm not) which I ignored at the time but later before going into the restaurant pulled him aside to tell him that I don\u2019t appreciate his jokes and to either talk to me with respect or just keep a casual relationship where we greet each other at family events but that was it. \n\nHe made a big deal out of it by involving his parents, my wife\u2019s parents. Few weeks after this I texted him asking him to just be civil in social events and to just do it for the sake of family. He did not reply but called me drunk on the day my wife and I got engaged to verbally abuse me over the call.\n\nMy wife\u2019s parents have been stuck in the middle the whole time and i feel for them. I told them that the only way they would get me in the room with him again would be the day he apologises but they invited the guy and his family to our wedding reception where he was right front and center during the whole time. I did not let it ruin our day but had a chat with FIL about how shitty move it was. I told them that I wouldn\u2019t be coming to their house again if they invite him. \n\nNow my wife has been going to her parent\u2019s house without me because he\u2019s always invited to things. \n\nFew days ago my wife said she doesn\u2019t want to go to her parents or events if I dont go with her. I told her that\u2019s fine because i\u2019m not going until they stop inviting him or cut him off.\n\nMy wife didn\u2019t say anything but was very sad and when I spoke to my father, he thinks I am being selfish AH (along with SIL\u2019s bf) and breaking up my wife\u2019s family.\n\nAITA?\n\nTldr; SIL\u2019s bf and I don\u2019t get along.

The problem is that you BIL said unacceptable, racist things to you.  And when you took him aside and told him that he could either speak to you respectfully or limit the relationship to distant civility, and rather than responding with an apology,, he complained to the whole family and became verbally abusive toward you when you got engaged to your wife.\n\nAnd he won't apologize. \n\nFor me, the racist behavior thing is the crux of it.  I don't blame you for not wanting to be around him.  And assuming your wife's parents don't share his POV, I think your wife needs to ask them to tell him that either he apologizes to you and behaves civilly toward you, or he can't come.  \n\nYou are not breaking up the family.  Your BIL's unacceptable behavior that you are understandably unwilling to tolerate is breaking up the family.  \n\nYou might want to ask your wife and in-laws exactly what their attitude is going to be when BIL makes similarly racist cracks about your future mixed-race children.  Perhaps they'd be better served nipping this in the bud than spending all family holidays without their grandchildren in future.\n\nNTA", "You are not breaking up your wife's family!\n\nAnd by the way, her parents are not \"stuck in the middle,\" they choose to be there by tolerating their badly-raised son in law's behavior. By tolerating his mistreatment of you,(let's get real here, his racism,)  they are complicit in it.\n\nSo no, don't go back. I would go ice skating in hell before I went to visit anyone in her family. She can continue to go by herself or she can not go at all. That is HER choice. No one is breaking up her family but her BIL and her parents apparent agreement with his behavior. Although I can tell you that if you were my husband, I would tell my parents they'd see me again when they dealt with their son in law and put a stop to his behavior, or stopped allowing him to visit.", "Erm, NTA. There\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m the bigger man\u201d and there\u2019s \u201cI guess people must be allowed to racially abuse me and harass me during important milestones in their lives because otherwise it\u2019s awkward for people who have made zero effort to defend me.\u201d You were v reasonable and so was your wife, sometimes people cave to bullies because it\u2019s assumed the kinder person will just cave. It\u2019s not fair.", "NTA. The baller move from the in-laws would be if they said no one was invited for Christmas. As it stands, your wife\u2019s family has chosen their comfort over yours at these events. Don\u2019t go. Hold the line.", "NTA My father had an issue with my husband being a different race than me. I got into a screaming match with him and cut him off for close to 4 years. When we reconnected, he knew better than to say anything insulting towards my husband.", "i'm stuck on the bit where her parents thought it was OK to invite the bf AND HIS FAMILY to YOUR wedding. what disrespectful ding dong nonsense is this? they are responsible for breaking up their own family by deciding to keep the peace with racists. \n\nNTA\n\nanyone who doesn't see the in laws and the bf as the problem are not your advocates. i'm including your wife into this group. she needs to have a serious sit down with her parents about stepping on you just so they can play \"happy family\". either you are her family, or you are not. when it comes to racism, the lines are pretty clear cut to any reasonable person.", "NTA, OP. You are the son-in-law, he\u2019s just a boyfriend. You are a permanent part of the family, he\u2019s possibly just temporary. Why, then, does he have more power? He seems to be in control of your movements, your wife\u2019s movements and your in-laws. Everything depends in where he is. I\u2019m in your side, OP. He sounds like a racist and a bully. Please consider the power dynamics here, and move them in your favor. You love your wife, and she loves her parents. It would serve you well to become closer to them. Why not invite them over to your house or out for dinner in a regular basis? Then you are in control of who is there and you can develop deeper ties without the bf there. Also, draft your wife into a team mentality either with you. Assuming she agrees with you that bf is racist and inappropriate, she must not like the idea the her sister is with him. Brainstorm ways with her for the three of you to hang out without him there. This will benefit you in the long run as SIL is part of your family now, and you need to build a relationship with her, too. She\u2019ll be more in your side when she gets yo know you better. Don\u2019t cut your wife off from her family but do meet either them on your Jen ground. Think about 20 years from now. Where do you want these relationships to be? Act from your own power, OP. He\u2019s the jerk and the temporary one.", "NTA, and for a different take, your wife is an asshole as well as SIL and sil\u2019s bf. Where was she during the time he was making comments in the car? You say she was in the car, but why didn\u2019t she speak up? At the wedding, why didn\u2019t she put her foot down when he and his family were invited? Why does she not have your back in this at all?", "NTA.\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine just sitting by while someone in my family was a dick to my husband. I definitely wouldn\u2019t go to my parent's house, leaving my husband at home while the person who was a jerk was there. \n\nThe BF is causing problems, but the rest of the family is just as guilty of complacency.", "NTA. First off- you should have said NO to him being at your wedding. Like you should\u2019ve put your foot down and said you there would be no wedding if he was there. It was a power play on your in-laws part. \n\nSecondly, your wife should be sticking up for you. Her sister\u2019s bf has been incredibly rude to you. You did the right thing and talked to him privately (and maturely). You basically said that you don\u2019t need to be friends and should just tolerate each other. He is immature and made a mountain out of a molehill. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though. You HAVE to follow up on saying you would never go anywhere where he\u2019ll be. If you \u201cgive in\u201d you are teaching your in-laws that they can get whatever they want and treat you as bad as they want as long as they are persistent enough. Don\u2019t allow this to happen. Stick to your guns.", "F@ck your InLaws and your wife is an Ahole for not defending you and kicking the boyfriend and boyfriend's family out of the wedding. She isn't putting you first.", "Maybe you could invite your on laws to your house instead.  That way you are in control of the guest list. Your wife's family are condoning his behaviour by not addressing it.", "Just for a bit of levity here I'll share that I have a sign in my house that everyone can see that says \"Ain't Family Grand?\"  And most of the time it's true, although a lot of people don't realize it's sarcastic because sarcasm is my specialty.", "NTA.\n\n\u2018If you have 10 people and 1 nazi sitting at a dinner table and willingly eating together, you have 11 Nazis.\u2019\n\nI\u2019d just substitute racist for nazi. I\u2019m sorry, but I feel like this includes your wife.\nNo one is stopping her seeing her family, it seems like a small ask to not attend when he does and visit with her parents together when he\u2019s not. I\u2019m baffled by her lack of support as the person married to you she should be your staunchest supporter", "NTA. I personally don't get along with most of my husband's family all on their part. No I'm not some rude selfish person that is out for blood, they just couldn't get along with me and that's it. If your wife doesn't understand fully that her sister's bf is a jerk that likes making you feel uncomfortable, it's truly time to have a full on sit down conversation with her. She needs to understand that your feelings are important too and that dude just isn't it for you.", "NTA his behavior is unacceptable and your wife shouldn\u2019t be guilting you into being around him.", "The parents need to tell him this is unacceptable", "NTA\n\nHowever, what\u2019s your endgame here? This will just continue to create tension within the family. Say you get your way and the family cuts this guy off. Now the sister will probably resent you cause her BF won\u2019t be at family functions. And say they get married one day or have kids. Then the family will be stuck in the middle again. \n\nThe guy sounds like an AH, but he only has the ability to bother this much if you give it to him. You have let him bother you so much that you are isolating yourself from your in-laws and requiring your wife to not be able to celebrate with her whole family with you included.\n\nYou\u2019re probably not gonna get an apology from this guy. But why does that matter? Why does it matter if he is invited to their house for family functions? \n\nYou\u2019re putting yourself in a lose lose situation because some AH hurt your feelings. Elephants don\u2019t worry about the opinions of flies. Be a fucking Elephant.", "Everybody sucks in this one (apart from your wife).\n\nI completely understand why you would feel uncomfortable around this dude who sounds like an obvious racist. However, when you married your wife, you also married into her family and whatever difficulties that may come with. \n\nYour wife also shouldn\u2019t be made to feel that she has to choose between her partner and her family, which at the moment she is having to. \n\nIf it were me, I would start going to larger family events where I feel I can stay away from him and generally gravitate towards my wife. If you are the one being kind and pleasant DESPITE all of his shitty racist remarks, then it shows that you are the bigger person. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever fair or wise to ask a parent to cut off their child completely because that is just an unrealistic ask - you are always going to lose at that game. However if you show that YOU are the respectful one and the kind one and the civil one, they may in time see the BIL actions for what they actually are and begin to uninvited him from smaller gatherings occasionally or make more of an effort to spend time with you and your wife outside the company of BIL.", "You know what he was doing there, right? \n\nHe wanted to be the top son in law, top of the pecking order & he had manipulated you. You are just showing everyone he is! \n\nPut your big boy pants on, pull them up tight & show he you won\u2019t be intimidated.", "YTA.
