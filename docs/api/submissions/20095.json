Reporting the cards as lost instead of stolen would have been a better option.", "Red flags, cancel your cards, please. Check your online records for the transactions. NTA.

This has no bearing on her, and really its her fault for being so flippant about meeting you.", "NTA. Make sure you're watching your accounts closely and report any fraudulent charges to the bank or creditor immediately. You're not bullying her. You're not treating her like a thief or criminal. You're being smart. \n\nIf my friend got so bent out of shape that I was canceling my debit card that was in their possession and pulled this shit, I'd be wondering what their motive was.

Also not in any way bullying. Its just common sense to do that in this day and age. She's not going to take care of your stuff the same way you would, so a much higher chance of them becoming lost or stolen. Also, no true \"friend\" would keep another's wallet for days. I would literally get up in the middle of the night and drive to a friends, or honestly anyone's, house to give them back their wallet. Because our cards are our life now.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t even need to tell her you were canceling the cards. Nothing you did effects her unless she is using or planning on using these cards. Have you checked the online activity lately?

It just seems so odd she\u2019s upset that you are taking steps to protect yourself. Also you\u2019re ensuring you get new cards sooner does she just expect you to live without being able to purchase anything?", "I just want to add a personal story for reference here:\n\nBack in summer of 2020, I accidentally left my wallet on the roof of my car while out shopping in a city about an hour drive from where I live. I notice it's gone when I get home. Call the store, call the police station in that area, nobody's turned it in. The next morning I cancel all my cards and order new ones. 2 more days pass and I'm at work sulking because I don't have access to any of my money and I'm still waiting for new bank cards, plus I had like $90 in cash that I'll never see again. On my lunch break, I jump on facebook and see a messenger notification. I have an unread message from a woman who isn't on my friend's list and who I'm not connected with in any way. The message was from that first night, the night I lost it. She said she was leaving the parking lot of the store I'd been at and noticed a wallet lying in a puddle. It was raining and she picked it up so it wouldn't get ruined sitting in water all night. She used the name on my ID to find me on Facebook and told me she'd keep it safe until she could get it back to me. I messaged back immediately and she offered to meet me halfway that night after I got off work. \n\nWhen she returned my wallet, she had cleaned the exterior, attempted to dry the whole thing with a hair dryer, and taken the cash out to air dry (then put it all back in), then drive 25 miles at 9pm to give it back after keeping it safe until I got her message 3 days later. A stranger. Someone I had never met, haven't interacted with since. Someone with no connection to me at all. In fact, when I was thanking her I mentioned that I'd pretty much accepted that I'd never see the wallet again before seeing her message and that I'd already canceled all my cards she said, \"smart girl.\" The fact that this person is supposed to be your FRIEND? Insane. \n\nNTA  and please consider that this is not the way friends treat friends. No matter the circumstances or motivations, your girl did you dirty.", "NTA it's YOUR money and its not in YOUR possession, thats literally all that matters. You need to do what makes you feel comfortable.", "NTA, your friend's actions are fishy as all hell. But I would just have canceled the cards without telling the friend.", "NTA    if she was a good friend,  you would have gotten it back the same day. You are being responsible, and she is offended, that's not normal.", "Your best friend?  Dang", "All shit about your crappy friend aside\u2026 even if you trusted her completely and this was all true\u2026 you\u2019d eventually have to do that anyway so you could get a new card?? She\u2019s not giving it to you so you need to cancel them and get replacements asap. That\u2019s not even personal it\u2019s just logical.", "Wait, your friend is not only not moving heaven and earth to get you your wallet and debit/credit cards back, but she is actively throwing obstacles in the way of meeting up to give you the wallet back... and now she is accusing YOU of bullying HER?

Not get angry and insult them lmao", "Jesus, thank god you caught her first", "NTA If you cancel the cards, the bank will send a replacement. So she doesn\u2019t have to worry about being busy. Much quicker solution by the sounds of it. Does she think you mean you\u2019re going to report them stolen to the police?", "NTA. I left my card in a friend's car after a road trip once. She was also immediately dodgy about meeting up to return it. Take it for the red flag it is! She ended up spending like $100 on it before my mom ended up canceling it. This was back in highschool, it was all my money from a summer job on it. I wish I'd just canceled it before she was able to charge so much.", "This doesn't make any sense...", "NTA OP.  u/Chef-Standard is right: instead of canceling them outright, you should freeze them, then check for any unfamiliar charges.  If you do that and nothing unfamiliar shows up, then you\u2019re good; if you see a charge that you don\u2019t recognize,  THAT\u2019s when you cancel the cards.", "Check your accounts ASAP and report any suspicious charges.

Had you not told her you were doing this, would she still have found out? It just sounds like she's trying to use your cards, in my opinion. Otherwise, it wouldn't really make a difference - it sounds like she thinks your TA because you've stopped her from being able to use your funds. I'm sorry, but i know without a doubt in my mind that if i had left my wallet in a friend's car they would have either brought it back to me or meet me somewhere where i could get it and same for if any of my friends left their wallet in my car.
