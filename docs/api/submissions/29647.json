Do you think they would have just been like \"Oh I guess you don't have cash, we'll let you go on your merry way, have a great time in Mexico?\" Or would they have stolen your shit instead of your money? Or potentially beaten you up? The fact that your friends had cash *to steal* prevented you from a worse fate then just getting your cash jacked. The money your friends had on them could have saved you from a worse fate than this one because they were able to *pay off the cops.* You should also kick in some money because you benefited from their cash.", "i didn\u2019t want any trouble so we didn\u2019t argue about it being nicotine !!!! we just handed it over bc we can buy more of those", "Well I agree with you there -- esp. since OP seems to think they could have been cartel members, so yeah getting your cash stolen would be the *optimum* outcome of that encounter. I think physical harm whether they are cops or not cops was still pretty plausible from people who are already rifling thru OP's shit though....which is why OP should kick in money, because her friends' cash helped avoid worse outcomes.", "exactly i was more worried about being human trafficked not jail this happens all the time in mexico that\u2019s why when people telling me that we would\u2019ve gotten hurt and it\u2019s just like no . y\u2019all better go look up the other reddit users this happened to .", "Yes, this happens all the time in the US as well, they just don't call it 'bribery' or 'robbery', they call it 'civil asset forfeiture'.\n\nIt's the second biggest form of theft in the United States, behind wage theft.", "then is it a form of blackmail?\n\nA bribe, i thought is when someone offers an asset/action in trade for something they want.\n\nblackmail, a request of an asset/action in trade, so someone doen't get something they dont want to happen?\n\nYou guys did not want to go to jail or whatever they were going to do if ya'll had no money on you.", "You could have gone to jail?", "that wasn\u2019t a hypothetical that\u2019s what tf happened . and that wasn\u2019t a bribe , they went through our purses and took the cash that was a robbery .", "baby it don\u2019t matter what y\u2019all say ima do what i want regardless .. i just don\u2019t be wanting biased opinions all the time .", "Baby\u2026you would have gone to jail bc they only care about the money. They can take you to jail for breathing down there. They don\u2019t care if it\u2019s real or made up. You would have gone to jail for not having money on you. They would have made crap up to put you in jail for.", "Do you think jail is the only thing rogue cops could've done to you if you didn't have cash.", "like y\u2019all acting like i set that shit up . shared experience that they thought was FUNNY .", "want me to pass out money i\u2019ll be loosing money i never lost to begin with bc i didn\u2019t bring any cash . i told them if they were going to bring cash to leave it in the room and not bring so much bc of shit like that", "and y\u2019all want me to be the martyr because i didn\u2019t have no cash ? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I am confused, are your OP or a different friend that was involved?", "so i owe them for ????", "no baby it was a robbery . when someone goes in your purse and takes the cash out of it without your permission it is a robbery", "no they weren\u2019t even real police officers", "It really doesn't matter if it's a bribe or a robbery, either way your friends *having cash* could have easily been what saved y'all from being victims of a worse crime.", "Why even post it if yuh gonna do you anyway?  Genuine question.    Like, to me, what I see is trying to feel validated for something you may have questioned.   \n\nHere\u2019s a real question to think about.  \n\nIs your friends relationship of yours more valuable then $130 bucks?   How you answer that should determine the severity of caring or not.     If you don\u2019t care,  then 1- who cares then.  It if you do care, then, make it right and move forward.  It\u2019s just $130 bucks.", "nah baby we wouldn\u2019t have , they were saying these people weren\u2019t even real cops when it was reported that they were impersonating them .", "ofc not but baby i did my research that\u2019s why i didn\u2019t have any cash but y\u2019all on the what ifs and i\u2019m on what happened .", "Hell nah you ain't a martyr, you're entirely in the right here. Stick to your guns!", "\"Owe\" isn't the right word.  Them having cash on hand is literally what kept you out of jail and frankly probably ended up costing less because the police would have forced you to have money wired from family to get released.", "So what do you think would happen if your friends had listened to you and none of you had money? Like they dumped all your purses and they found nothing but chapsticks and sunglasses?", "So you could have been murdered, beaten, or anything else.", "yes it does . a bribe is something where we said \u201chey if you don\u2019t take us to jail we will give you all our money\u201d and a robbery is straight up someone taking your shit without your permission", "Nah baby\u2026you\u2019re a young woman who is lucky all that happened is you ended up owing your friends $110. YTA", "You should have had a small amount of cash on you specifically for this situation. Your all idiots but such is life.", "so i need to give them money for ?????", "In one comment she says she thinks they were cartel so her friends' cash could have been what kept them from being like, murdered??", "so you want me to give them money for what ?? baby idk if it\u2019s bc i\u2019ve been in the hood and grew up in it but robbery is robbery .", "No, a cop can ask you for a bribe. \"If you don't give us all your money we'll take you to jail.\" is him asking you to bribe him.", "i don\u2019t owe them shit and you can get in the field too about it .", "Baby it's bc I live in a high crime city that I think she's delusional if she thinks these dudes would've just bounced if none of these girls had cash to hand over.", "And we\u2019ve found our narcissist for the hour.
