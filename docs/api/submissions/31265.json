If he has immunocompromised family members he should be wearing a mask everywhere he goes and purposefully avoiding contact. He also should be extra cautious because even healthy non-sick people could be incubating a disease. Someone coughing once doesn't mean that they are contagious. It could be asthma, allergies, dust, etc.", "NTA Asthma, allergies, GERD, dry throat  etc\u2026can make you cough. That guy was being over the top rude..", "NTA- but tell him if thats the case he should wear an N-95 mask, which if he isn\u2019t he very easily could be full of it.

Like dude, she probably just had a dry throat or a tickle. What an overreaction. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI've sounded AWFUL before when coughing just from a dry throat. Like about to puke from the coughing. He probably would have ran for the hills. \ud83e\udd23\nI will admit I've given the side eye to people coughing before, but I don't yell at them. I just keep my distance just in case. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nNo need to be rude.\n\nIf the jerk wanted to protect himself or his family, he'd wear a mask like my family does. I can't say how effective it is, but we get less flu(s) and colds than we used to. That's a win for us. I wouldn't force my opinion on someone else.", "I\u2019d probably say NAH. Just sounds like the kind of snipes that tired people trade with each other on bad days", "NAH.  You stood up for you girlfriend and moved to avoid any additional unnecessary conflict.  If he has family members who are fragile and immunocompromised, there\u2019s a possibility he has been dealing with a lot over the past few years.  Have some empathy and give him grace.  We have no idea what another person is dealing with.", "Too soon to ask probably, but did she develop any further symptoms? Basically, did this dude predict correctly,  or no? Also, he should have a mask on and also, he should just get the curbside delivery. Grocery stores are heavy traffic with people touching everything constantly.", "Yep.  I help care for my vulnerable parents.  I have my own risk factors.\n\nSo I wear an N95.  And I don\u2019t feed it to the local rednecks by force when they get all offended that I\u2019m \u201cwearing a mask at them.\u201c\n\nI do avoid the obvious plague carriers in public and at work though. Not people like OPs gf, one cough or sneeze can be anything.\n\nOthers though - I will never understand why So Many people who know they\u2019re sick visit my free public workplace though.  It\u2019s free, it\u2019s been around over a century, it\u2019s fun but open all the time, it\u2019s not a once in a lifetime opportunity.\n\nStay home or keep your kid home if you\u2019re hacking up a lung, vomiting, running a fever, dripping more mucous than swamp thing, or have chicken pox or anything else.  The rest of our 1.1 million yearly visitors Don\u2019t want what you have.\n\nHad one lovely big family during the time testing was required for travel get notified via app of Five out of eight positive covid tests while they were standing next to one of my employees once.\n\nTwo of them were coughing.  Did they go \u201coh shit\u201d and leave the very public place full of people to go home or to their hotel?  No.  Did they even split up and send the positive vectors home?  No.  Just continued shopping and poking around in my area.  For half an hour.  Before wandering off to breathe in every other room on the premises.", "Nah that guy was a total dick, he should be wearing a mask or ordering groceries online if he\u2019s so worried about that.", "100% he isn't entitled to everyone else in public serving to him with no effort on his behalf to protect his interests."]}
