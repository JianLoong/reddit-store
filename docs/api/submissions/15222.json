My brother\u2019s 12th birthday is today, while my 17th birthday is two days from now. \n\nBecause of this, starting from when I was about to turn 5 (after my brother was born); I have always remember that my family have officially stopped celebrating on my actual birthday, and rather prefer that we celebrate both of our birthdays on my little brother\u2019s birth *date.*\n\nAnd whatever compromise that I have, my parents had always dismissed. \n\nLike when I asked if we can celebrate on the day that\u2019s between our birthdays, my parents would respond that it would be rude to my little brother to celebrate his birthday late, but celebrating mine earlier isn\u2019t.\n\nOr when I asked if we can just have two separate birthdays, my parents have stated that that was a stupid idea because that wasn\u2019t cost-friendly and it was too time-consuming to have two separate birthday celebration. Especially since the birthdays were so close to each other. \n\nIt gotten so bad to the point that no one in our extended family even remembers when my own birthday is, because everyone believes that me and my brother have the exact same birthday. Which makes me hate how close me and my brother\u2019s birthday is. \n\nSo, for this birthday, I ended up doing some changes for this year. \n\nWith the money saved up, I ended up buying a decorated cake that said \u201cHappy Birthday, [brother\u2019s name]\u201d *only,* and switched up and tossing the cake that had both me and my brother\u2019s name. \n\nI ended up hiding all the pink decorations, and leaving behind only the blue ones. And I also made sure to scribble off my name off anything I can get my hands on (like the banners, invitations, letters, etc) so that only my brother\u2019s name and information was on it. \n\nAnd, on the day of the party, I rejected any gifts toward me and stated that; since it is my brother\u2019s birthday today, we should be celebrating *his* day since I hate celebrating my birthday on a day that isn\u2019t on my actual birth date. \n\nThis caused a mixed reaction to a lot of family members, but it ended with many respecting my wishes and focusing on the birthday boy.\n\nMy brother was the only one that was completely happy about it, probably because this is the first time that he was able to celebrate a birthday that was his own and he enjoyed getting all the attention for himself.\n\nMy parents, however, was livid at me for being petty and childish enough for wasting my time and money (and especially *their* money, with all the vandalism that I did) sabotaging this party. \n\nIn addition to that, they were also mad that I made them look bad, because a lot of our family are giving my parents flak for making it look like they are prioritizing my brother over me, as well as complaining that my insistence that they focus on my brother on *his* birthday to be unsettling and worrying. \n\nI mean, I think I may have gone overboard just a bit, but I don\u2019t think I did anything that wrong.\n\nAITA though?", "created_utc": 1681955621, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12shzl7/aita_for_sabotaging_my_little_brothers_and_my/", "score": 1300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Me and my brother personally never celebrated big after we passed around 7/8 years old but that\u2019s mostly because we both are introverted with our whole family living in a different country. \nWhy can\u2019t your family just celebrate both your birthdays privately and separately as a family. And then the weekend after you can have the party.\nDoesn\u2019t that make more sense? You get your presents from family and some good friends (maybe invite your own friends for a casual hangout, nothing fancy) \nAnd on the party day people can give you your presents and wish you a \u201clate\u201d happy birthday.\nNow that you are 17 it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much anymore cuz you already did it the other way for the past 12 years and you\u2019ll be an adult soon. But maybe suggest other options to your parents.\nI don\u2019t wanna call them the AH, since you didn\u2019t give that much information on them or how much you actually argued / discussed this.\nAlso giving your brother the spotlight today was a very nice and sweet move. That was probably one of his best presents to have his day be HIS day.\nI hope your next birthday will be better.\nHappy birthday to your brother.\nAnd happy birthday (in 2 days) to you", "NTA Your parents have been deluding themselves for 10 years that what they were doing was fine.\n\nWhenever you tried to confront their delusion they told you to stop being childish and selfish.\n\nSo you confronted their delusion in public and they found their behaviour indefensible. \n\nThat's why they are mad.

It is indeed difficult to find a compromise when one party is unwilling to consider alternative solutions. In light of this, OP's frustration is understandable, and it's important that they continue to express their feelings and the need for a fair solution.\n\nOne potential strategy would be for OP to have a conversation with their parents during a non-stressful time, explaining the impact that the current situation has on them and how it affects their relationship with their brother.

Now I did it very different the party was the weekend between the two birthdays so my daughter\u2019s was always late and my son\u2019s was early.  Here\u2019s the part that was different. They were allowed to invite their own friends usually they were siblings to the other attendees.  I had 2 cakes with their individual theme.  They were smaller but served the proper amount, in the flavor each of them wanted.  I let them choose where to have the party. One year it was at the nature center, the zoo, the children\u2019s museum.  I made sure that the activities were age based and tables were set up separately.  They opened presents with their friends.  We did this until they decided they wanted separate parties.  My son was the one who decided he wanted to do dinner and go out with friends.  Daughter had her party the weekend after her birthday wherever she wanted.\n\nForcing kids to share a birthday where only one child is considered and one is just an after thought isn\u2019t fair to either one.  They loved having parties together because all their friends came and the parents ended up with free time because they had both kids attending.  One mom would always schedule her spa day on our party day and the husband would do the pick up.  One dad would stay and lend a hand.  He said he did it because we always had awesome cake.  It wasn\u2019t the regular sheet cake.\n\nFor my daughters 21st we went to dinner after and celebrated. She wanted to celebrate with her friends.

We always discussed what kind of cake we wanted - usually a marble cake, which we both loved. The best year was when we agreed to ask for it \"unbaked\" as we both loved licking the bowls...

Unfortunately I still had to go horse riding. Most other parties we did together. We also picked out our birthday food together. Neither of us getting our favourite, but both getting something we really liked. \nOur birthday happens to be in the middle of summer, so was rarely celebrated on it actual birthday.

A celebration doesn't need to be an incredibly expensive thing, so respecting your wishes to have your own day is not a big ask", "The clearest example of fuck around and find out i've seen today, NTA", "NTA! \n\nAlso, happy birthday, birthday buddy!", "NTA in any way, shape, form, or idea. I wish my sisters were like you because you tried to discuss issues, offered compromise & in the end, everyone wins.", "And", "My cousin and I are 4 days apart, and her sister and my sister are 8 days apart a month before. I have never once had a birthday on my own, it has always been the 4 of us together (now it is 6 of us together as my nephew and cousins' husband have joined up), so I feel your pain. Them insisting on doing it on HIS birthday is fucked up, if it was otherwise I would've gone for NAH  but in this case, NTA.", "Brilliant! NTA. Your parents are mad that you\u2019ve called them out in too skillful of a way for them to deny it or punish you!", "Andrew", "NTA; your parents actions make them look bad. So if they don\u2019t want to look like jerks they need to change their behavior and stop acting like jerks. \n\nI\u2019m glad you were able to stand up for yourself.", "NTA. I think you actually handled this with a lot of maturity for your age. You didn\u2019t take away from his birthday at all, just made it clear that it wasn\u2019t yours! Good job OP.", "My little sister's birthday is the day after mine yet we find time to celebrate both seperately", "NTA.\n\nMy birthday is two days before my older brother's. We stopped doing joint birthdays by the time I was five. If your parents are so devoted to saving money by merging parties, they could at least alternate days.\n\nAlso how long can that last? How long can both of your friend groups intermingle at a party? For us the answer was \"not long\" and we have a smaller age gap.", "NTA. Sorry your birthdays suck. It gets better", "Reading the headline and then seeing OP was 17 made me think 'major YTA' coming. But in fact, she handled the situation with considerable grace and intelligence, while still making a perfectly valid point about how hurt she is. And really it's not so much about birthdays but parents who make the boy the golden child and don't care about the girl. NTA.", "On behalf of your children, thank you. I share a birthday week with three siblings (not twins, just close dates) and never had my \"own\" celebration until friends took me out for my 16th. The feeling between the group celebration and having something specifically planned for me was night and day.", "I vote picking Father's Day, since parents clearly favor boys.", "A double [middle child](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/jdtezx/coming_from_a_middle_child/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1). Do your parents remember your very existence?", "Your whataboutism is obnoxious. Maybe learn some empathy.", "You don't even need a birthday party every year. We had gifts and a cake and it was a good time. My brother and I's birthdays are 9 days apart and not once did my mum try and merge our birthdays either. Although that could be down to my mum's own childhood experiences - her birthday is Christmas week and her parents wouldn't get her anything, and just tell her she'd get an extra present on Christmas, which she never did.", "By some weird fluke, all but two of the children in my kids generation were born in the same 42 day period, 3 of them being within 5 days of each other and the period being summer break. I have a large family and with people going on vacation we had to get creative. Kids go out to dinner at the restaurant of their choice on their actual birthdays with parents and grandparents. Family parties get grouped by birthday siblings. Friends parties are around the actual birthday kids birthday. So everyone gets to do something special on their actual birthday, but the extended family don\u2019t end up with a birthday party every weekend or half the people not showing up because they are away on vacation.", "My youngest is boxing day and your mums childhood is my fear for my LO.", "Bad bot.", "I have twins, and usually, one of them has a sleepover on the Friday night closest to their birthday and the other on Saturday night. Sometimes they choose to do it together, but they choose, not me.\n\nI have always done separate cakes, presents etc", "We ended up with 3 under 3, 2 in November and 1 last week of September. Only reason why the one is in September is because he was 6 weeks premature. Anniversary is also in November. How did we end up with 3 November babies? Goddam Patrick mahomes and my husband being a massive chiefs fan. \n\nEveryone jokes that they're quarantine babies. No. They're mahomes babies lol.", "Honestly I am impressed by this bot.", "My god. I\u2019m 20 and I had this kind of \u201cfantastic\u201d idea right around Halloween. I bought 60 candy bars and a bag of 220 pieces of candy. It\u2019s a college campus. There\u2019s no kids to pass out candy to. Thank God my boyfriend lives in a frat house. I put out a candy bowl for the frat guys. Me and my 3 roommates actually all did this same thing without conversation and we could not share", "My mum passed when I was a kid and unfortunately all our kids are conceived around dates connected to her like her birthday, wedding anniversary. So we joke it's just my mum providing a way for hubby to complain about his mother in law. It's weird but it helps my sanity to have atleast some explanation why I am so fertile around Easter.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">some strange cloth\n\nin what way was the cloth strange?", "You gotta have jokes ready! My aunt says she's gonna go Tanya Harding on Mahomes to keep us from having a 4th lol"]}
