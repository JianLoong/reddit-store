My brother\u2019s 12th birthday is today, while my 17th birthday is two days from now. \n\nBecause of this, starting from when I was about to turn 5 (after my brother was born); I have always remember that my family have officially stopped celebrating on my actual birthday, and rather prefer that we celebrate both of our birthdays on my little brother\u2019s birth *date.*\n\nAnd whatever compromise that I have, my parents had always dismissed. \n\nLike when I asked if we can celebrate on the day that\u2019s between our birthdays, my parents would respond that it would be rude to my little brother to celebrate his birthday late, but celebrating mine earlier isn\u2019t.\n\nOr when I asked if we can just have two separate birthdays, my parents have stated that that was a stupid idea because that wasn\u2019t cost-friendly and it was too time-consuming to have two separate birthday celebration. Especially since the birthdays were so close to each other. \n\nIt gotten so bad to the point that no one in our extended family even remembers when my own birthday is, because everyone believes that me and my brother have the exact same birthday. Which makes me hate how close me and my brother\u2019s birthday is. \n\nSo, for this birthday, I ended up doing some changes for this year. \n\nWith the money saved up, I ended up buying a decorated cake that said \u201cHappy Birthday, [brother\u2019s name]\u201d *only,* and switched up and tossing the cake that had both me and my brother\u2019s name. \n\nI ended up hiding all the pink decorations, and leaving behind only the blue ones. And I also made sure to scribble off my name off anything I can get my hands on (like the banners, invitations, letters, etc) so that only my brother\u2019s name and information was on it. \n\nAnd, on the day of the party, I rejected any gifts toward me and stated that; since it is my brother\u2019s birthday today, we should be celebrating *his* day since I hate celebrating my birthday on a day that isn\u2019t on my actual birth date. \n\nThis caused a mixed reaction to a lot of family members, but it ended with many respecting my wishes and focusing on the birthday boy.\n\nMy brother was the only one that was completely happy about it, probably because this is the first time that he was able to celebrate a birthday that was his own and he enjoyed getting all the attention for himself.\n\nMy parents, however, was livid at me for being petty and childish enough for wasting my time and money (and especially *their* money, with all the vandalism that I did) sabotaging this party. \n\nIn addition to that, they were also mad that I made them look bad, because a lot of our family are giving my parents flak for making it look like they are prioritizing my brother over me, as well as complaining that my insistence that they focus on my brother on *his* birthday to be unsettling and worrying. \n\nI mean, I think I may have gone overboard just a bit, but I don\u2019t think I did anything that wrong.\n\nAITA though?", "created_utc": 1681955621, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12shzl7/aita_for_sabotaging_my_little_brothers_and_my/", "score": 4947, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Me and my brother personally never celebrated big after we passed around 7/8 years old but that\u2019s mostly because we both are introverted with our whole family living in a different country. \nWhy can\u2019t your family just celebrate both your birthdays privately and separately as a family. And then the weekend after you can have the party.\nDoesn\u2019t that make more sense? You get your presents from family and some good friends (maybe invite your own friends for a casual hangout, nothing fancy) \nAnd on the party day people can give you your presents and wish you a \u201clate\u201d happy birthday.\nNow that you are 17 it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much anymore cuz you already did it the other way for the past 12 years and you\u2019ll be an adult soon. But maybe suggest other options to your parents.\nI don\u2019t wanna call them the AH, since you didn\u2019t give that much information on them or how much you actually argued / discussed this.\nAlso giving your brother the spotlight today was a very nice and sweet move.

Now I did it very different the party was the weekend between the two birthdays so my daughter\u2019s was always late and my son\u2019s was early.  Here\u2019s the part that was different. They were allowed to invite their own friends usually they were siblings to the other attendees.  I had 2 cakes with their individual theme.  They were smaller but served the proper amount, in the flavor each of them wanted.  I let them choose where to have the party. One year it was at the nature center, the zoo, the children\u2019s museum.  I made sure that the activities were age based and tables were set up separately.  They opened presents with their friends.  We did this until they decided they wanted separate parties.  My son was the one who decided he wanted to do dinner and go out with friends.  Daughter had her party the weekend after her birthday wherever she wanted.\n\nForcing kids to share a birthday where only one child is considered and one is just an after thought isn\u2019t fair to either one.  They loved having parties together because all their friends came and the parents ended up with free time because they had both kids attending.  One mom would always schedule her spa day on our party day and the husband would do the pick up.  One dad would stay and lend a hand.  He said he did it because we always had awesome cake.  It wasn\u2019t the regular sheet cake.\n\nFor my daughters 21st we went to dinner after and celebrated. She wanted to celebrate with her friends.  Son didn\u2019t care and we went to dinner on both milestones and friends came by and they all went out together.  So it can be done.  You can be an individual while at the same time sharing an event.", "NTA. I grew up with a similar situation.

When I was little we lived in the same house as my aunt and uncle. My cousin's and my birthdays were a week apart, and there wasn't a lot of money, so no parties. We would get presents on our respective birthdays, but a joint cake - halfway between the two days, as per our own agreement. We always discussed what kind of cake we wanted - usually a marble cake, which we both loved. The best year was when we agreed to ask for it \"unbaked\" as we both loved licking the bowls... We ate about a quarter of the raw dough with spoons, felt a bit green around the gills, and graciously allowed my aunt to put the rest in the oven.\n\nThe lesson: let the kids decide how they want to approach close birthdays!", "For twins it kind of depends on what they want to do, me and my sister were always fine having a shared birthday since we always had the same friend group and it was easier that way, maybe if we didn't have the same friend group or didn't like each other as much it would have been different but we were cool with it.\n\nWe also had the option of seperate parties if we wanted to but we could always agree on a theme so \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "That depends on the twins.\nI've never minded celebrating my birthday together with my twin sister.

The only real seperate one I remember is that when she really wanted a horse riding party and I didn't. We went horse riding with her friends and on a treasure hunt in the forest with my friends. Unfortunately I still had to go horse riding. Most other parties we did together. We also picked out our birthday food together. Neither of us getting our favourite, but both getting something we really liked. \nOur birthday happens to be in the middle of summer, so was rarely celebrated on it actual birthday. So we usually had 3 parties. One for family and family in friends.

You did something to look innocent and kind towards your younger sibling but villanize your parents.

Still, I also think having it on a day that falls in the middle of your birthdays isn't a terrible idea either. The day itself(in my opinion) doesn't matter just as long as the birthday is recognized and celebrated.\n\nShoots I've celebrated my friends birthday weeks after because that's when we were finally able to link up and afford to do it (their birthday falls during end of term/exam period).\n\nIf I were your parents and could afford it, I'd let you guys celebrate separate birthdays. I don't know yall financials tho.. but I can see how it could be too expensive to have two separate events. Even two separate cakes and foods so close together especially with the prices people are charging these days. They'd even have to buy more decorations.\n\nThere are nuances I don't know and off the bat I'm sorry but you come off as a brat. As the oldest, you'd think at this point (17yrs) you'd be more understanding about the nuances of money requirements in comparison to a 12 year old. They aren't neglecting you since they put both their kids name on the cake and had pink stuff/decorations for you.

It was a lot of work for me, but so be it. \n\nEven though they're both boys, I never expected them to share interests or friends or anything as children that would make a joint party make sense. By the time the older one got to be 10 or so and started wanting to do activities with friends (laser tag or trampoline place or such), then the we started having to hold the parties on separate days. Still a lot of work, but again, so be it. \n\nAs a parent in the same situation as yours, I think your parents have dropped the ball big time, especially once you got to be a teenager. No teenage girl wants the same kind of birthday party as her much younger brother (5 yrs won't mean as much in 10 yrs, but it's a huge difference as kids). Even if it was simply too much for them to hold separate events, they could have at the very least alternated each year which date to celebrate. The favoritism they've shown is astounding. \n\nAs for your parents being mad that they now \"look bad,\" well... if they're embarrassed to have people know what they've been doing, maybe they shouldn't have done it.

If you and your brother were 6 months apart, you would have two separate birthdays, which I'm assuming wouldn't be a cost issue and would fit in your family budget.

Good job OP.", "OP, (a mom responding here) You did not go too far at all.\n\nI am so impressed with how you problem-solved here. You advocated for yourself and politely brought attention to your own preferences by successfully circumnavigating the huge wall your parents have put up and reinforced for years (more than a decade!!!). You did so in a way that actually supported your brother (he is innocent in all this), made him happier, and actually highlighted that he is also losing out with your parents' approach. You did so in a way that was not mean or vulgar or antagonistic. I picture you growing up to be some great diplomat or world leader :)\n\n* If your parents are embarrassed, it's because they know they cannot defend their weird logic to any of the other adults who now better understand what's been going on.\n* They are and have, in fact, been completely dismissing you as an individual, as a child of theirs completely separate from their other child, as a person who has your own preferences and interests and ways of wanting to celebrate.\n* Unless your family is in some serious poverty, the cost of two birthdays does not have to be too much for the family to bear, nor a waste of money. As a teen you were able to afford a second cake. Decorations can cost pretty much nothing. They don't have to buy any more presents.\n* As for time, I can understand them combining celebrations when you both were pretty little - if the gatherings were mostly just family and your parents were exhausted from running after two little ones. But, as you both got older, you had different friends, different interests; and you needed less constant supervision. If they were actually including your friends and your brother's friends in the celebrations, it would still take extra effort to plan and supervise a party that truly celebrated each of you. The difference between how you and your brother would want to celebrate had to be sky-high for at least the last seven years.\n* Even if you believe that, for your parents, this was really all about minimizing the time and money spent on celebrating; it doesn't explain their insistence that it only be celebrated on his exact birthday. I thought, \"Surely, in twelve years, there's been a year or two where the two birthdays fell on either side of a weekend, and it would have been easiest to celebrate both birthdays on the Saturday in-between. Surely, your birthday fell on a Saturday at least once.\" For example, it seems like. between 2017 and 2019, his birthday fell on a Wed, Thurs, and Fri (in reverse order). Your birthday had to be on the following weekend during that time.\n* So it's clear your parents really cannot defend the position they enforced all these years. You made a wonderful stand. (BTW, the patience you've had all these years is astounding!) Next year is your 18th birthday. Please make the plans you want, with the people you want to celebrate with. If your parents tell you that they do want to actually celebrate you on your birthday, keep a few things in mind:\n\n1. At 18, you do not have to follow your parents' plans.\n2. If they seem to sincerely want to correct their mistakes and give you a proper celebration, it would be great if you can give them that opportunity; BUT it's also perfectly OK for you to have your own plans and tell them that their plans need to work around your plans. (If they have NOT learned from or repented their mistakes, you have no obligation to sit through their plans.)\n3. It sounds like your extended family is very much a part of your celebrations. I hope you use those diplomatic problem-solving skills of yours to allow them to celebrate you properly (at last!). There's no need to lose/reject the family celebrating you.\n\nI'm not sure which is your actual birthday, but I'll think a little Happy Birthday to you tomorrow and the two days after, in hopes of getting it on your actual birthday!", "Legend.

We still both got our own friends, parts of the \"theme\" & cake. It helped i was never girly & so much a tomboy that never wanted princess parties lol. It also helped that were only two yrs apart so especially when we were younger there wasnt as much as of an age gap & due to sports & being in a small town we had a lot of the same friend circles (my friends younger siblings were his friends that we all played ball & grew up together) \n\nOne we got a bit older & didnt *want* to celebrate together no one made a big deal about it though.

We loved having it together and they always made sure we switched days every year, one year it was on his birthday, the other on mine.\n\nYour birthday should be about you, you should have the choice on what you want to do. Getting forced to celebrate on your brother's day will only cause resentment towards your brother or parents...", "My kids birthdays are 4 days i onlybhad a couple of parties.for both of them on the same day.  They don't have the same interests or same friends.  Those 2 parties were when my youngest was one, since all we had for her was a smash cake at sons party, and once when they were young and both agreed to a SpongeBob party together.", "NTA. It's good the family are giving them flack for \"making it look like they are prioritizing my brother over me, as well as complaining that my insistence that they focus on my brother on his birthday to be unsettling and worrying\" because... That's exactly what they're doing!", "NTA. It's stupid and cost-prohibitive to celebrate two birthdays? Maybe they shouldn't have had two whole kids.", "For a family get-together I can see why it would be easier to do one for both (and I agree, why not do it on the day in between? Or on the closest weekend?) but parties for friends? With a five year gap, that's two entirely different friend groups and they could - and should - absolutely celebrate separately.\n\nBut then our extended family lived a minimum of an hour away, so any birthday visits from grandparents or uncles or aunts would absolutely just be done on the nearest weekend and not on the actual day, because everyone was working during the week. They definitely wouldn't have driven for an hour on a Tuesday and then done the same on the Thursday for the next birthday, that would have been out of the question. It's a whole different story if you all live in the same part of town, though. Nothing to say they can't pop around on both days, even if it's not an actual party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>a lot of our family are giving my parents flak for making it look like they are prioritizing my brother over me\n\nI mean ... they are. Literally. Hence, NTA.", "NTA. The sooner people get out of the childish \"ME ME ME It's MY day!\" mentality the better. For kids, yes, fine, but you're probably near drinking age ad stuff now so you'll likely be off doing things with your peers as your actual birthday celebrations and family stuff tends to become a bit more mature and reasoned. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnyone over 21 making a big deal about their birthday besides milestone ones needs to realise it's just another day, it's not special to anyone except them and their parents, and that they don't need to include every random in it. We have an older lady in the office here who **insists** that he birthday be celebrated and she be made a fuss despite no-one else doing so on their days. She expects gifts, attention, an easy day, cake etc. Every other person brings in cake on their birthday, gets a \"Happy Birthday!\" and that's it. But this nearly 60yo acts like a toddler. There's a few of us who always seem to be in day-long meetings or on annual leave (if convenient) on her birthday. :D", "Hmm, i think the cake and saying \"I'd like to focus on my brother today\" are totally reasonable.\n\nI'm not sure what went down with the rejected gifts. Were they politely asked to set their gifts aside? Did OP snap at them? That might have something to do with the family reaction. It's really the parent's fault that birthdays have been so unequally celebrated, not the extended family.\n\nContext: My sibling and I had major graduations on the same day - me with my master's, them with a bachelor's. At my suggestion, we all went to my sibling's (I didn't even walk at my graduation) because everyone had already come out for my college graduation a few years before. Family members did offer me congratulations and gifts, but i said \"thank you,\" set aside the gifts, and moved on to make the day about my sibling. Making a big deal out of rejecting their kindness would have made the day about me.\n\nIt seems like the little brother was happy and didn't feel his party had been overshadowed, but did OP make aunts and uncles feel like the AH for bringing their gifts and good wishes to a party that had previously expected those things?", "My brother and I are twelve years and sixteen hours apart; I was born at midday, and he was born at 4am the next day. My mother threatened me with 'joint parties' so that my friends and I could 'help' her with my brother's toddler friends for years until I moved out. Fortunately she never went through with it.\nDefinite NTA, and if she had gone through with her threats, I doubt I would have been as clever and resourceful as you.", "OP didn\u2019t make them feel bad. Her parents did by misleading the aunts and uncles into thinking this was a party for her when the parties had never actually been for her. If the parties had been for her, her parents would have tried to make it fun for her. If family members felt bad that\u2019s on the parents", "Oh, but celebrating one person late is rude but not celebrating early.", "Found one of the parents", "better yet just cut that piece out of the cake", "Add more frosting on top of their name.", "The whole post is about how the parents are not allowing op to do that, she wants to have her birthday on her birthday, but is not allowed.\n\n\u2018If you don\u2019t belong in prison, why don\u2019t you just leave?

It truly is the small things and it doesn't cost much to be considerate, especially of children. They don't yet understand that hey, it's Christmas, everything's expensive, it might be difficult to fit in extra presents for them. They just see their siblings or friends or other family members getting separate presents for their birthdays and Christmas and think they're less than.", "NTA. My sister's birthday is the day before mine, but we had separate parties every year. She's 4 years older than me, all of our friends were different, it didn't make sense to have them at the same time. Also she knew it was important to celebrate us separately. I would have been so fucking mad if they did this to us. I'm so mad for you.", "NTA.   \nYou offered valid options before you had to take the \"nuclear\" option on your brother's birthday.\n\nYour parents are getting flack because they should. *They* *are prioritizing your brother over you.*", "NTA. I was born right beside a major holiday, as was my mom. My family makes it a point to not do the grouping of my, mom and holiday in one day because even though it may \"save money\" its exceptionally tacky and makes all involved feel less than. \n\nYou know if your folks were in this situation with shared birthdays THEY would dislike the idea too.", ">In addition to that, they were also mad that I made them look bad,   \nbecause a lot of our family are giving my parents flak for making it   \nlook like they are prioritizing my brother over me, as well as   \ncomplaining that my insistence that they focus on my brother on his birthday to be unsettling and worrying.\n\nNTA. Your parents *are* prioritizing your brother over you.  I think you handled things relatively well.  It's perfectly reasonable for parents to want to conserve costs with this sort of thing if finances are tight but to consistently insist on the focus on your brother's day over yours is ridiculous.  What do you do when his Birthday falls on a weekday but yours does not?  Still choosing his is nuts, that's so inconvenient!  Plus at the age you're at having a combined party makes it relatively likely it's only truly geared towards one of you.  A 17 year old's party is likely a bit rambunctious for a 12 year old and no 17 year old I know wants to attend a 12 year old's party!  Either way, your parents are being ridiculous and hopefully a little humiliation will shock them enough to get it right next year.  Turning 18 is a big deal, your brother deserves to have a wonderful day turning 13 but your 18th marks a the shift into adulthood and should be a major celebration.  Especially noteworthy as if you're outside the US then it's also the legal drinking age in most countries and you're entering into an age when any halfway decent party needs to send the kids home/to bed or at least see you and your friends move to a second location.", "This hurt me too.", "I doubt the illusion was shattered on the parents' part.  What I'm curious about is whether the parents' obsession with \"saving money\" is due to struggling or being cheap. Either way, two half-price birthdays would have beaten one big birthday, and it's tragic for both children that they were never able to realize this.", "The parents villianized themselves by acting like villians.", "Oh, come on! Immoral? No wonder you favor her brother over her. Your entire perception of your daughter is warped beyond recognition.", ">Why not have the party on your actual birthday? \n\nParents have refused to have a party on OPs actual birthday, it's always on little bro's birthday.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It doesn't have to be on the same day as the event? \n\nIf it doesn't have to be on the same day as the event, then why is it ALWAYS on little bro's bday?  If it doesn't have to be on the same day as the event, then that holds true for little bro too.   They could have it on his b-day one year, and her's on the next.  Or -- get this -- in between the two birthdays (which OP suggested, or are you just ignoring that part?)  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy should OP have to be the one to not have a party on her bday year after year after year?   Even after making suggestions for compromises.   You keep saying that they had decorations for her and her name on the cake like that makes it all better.   It doesn't.  Every year, they've made little bro a priority, making sure he gets a party on his day.   You're acting like them acknowledging her birthday at all (and never on her birthday) is some huge gift.   It's not.  Refusing to listen to her, refusing to compromise year after year, is not showing how much they care about her.  \n\nIf OP should be grateful that her parents even acknowledged her birthday at all, then little bro should be the same.  He shouldn't have to have a party on his day either.  They should have done the thing that OP suggested (have the party on a day between the two birthdays).  You know, the suggestion that you keep ignoring.  Stop trying to justify ~~your~~ the parents' prioritizing one child's feelings over another multiple times.   It's lazy.", "Surely you mean a maple leaf? My grandmother bought me socks with \"maple leaves\" on them because they look like the leaves on our trees at home!
