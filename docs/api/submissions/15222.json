My brother\u2019s 12th birthday is today, while my 17th birthday is two days from now. \n\nBecause of this, starting from when I was about to turn 5 (after my brother was born); I have always remember that my family have officially stopped celebrating on my actual birthday, and rather prefer that we celebrate both of our birthdays on my little brother\u2019s birth *date.*\n\nAnd whatever compromise that I have, my parents had always dismissed. \n\nLike when I asked if we can celebrate on the day that\u2019s between our birthdays, my parents would respond that it would be rude to my little brother to celebrate his birthday late, but celebrating mine earlier isn\u2019t.\n\nOr when I asked if we can just have two separate birthdays, my parents have stated that that was a stupid idea because that wasn\u2019t cost-friendly and it was too time-consuming to have two separate birthday celebration. Especially since the birthdays were so close to each other. \n\nIt gotten so bad to the point that no one in our extended family even remembers when my own birthday is, because everyone believes that me and my brother have the exact same birthday. Which makes me hate how close me and my brother\u2019s birthday is. \n\nSo, for this birthday, I ended up doing some changes for this year. \n\nWith the money saved up, I ended up buying a decorated cake that said \u201cHappy Birthday, [brother\u2019s name]\u201d *only,* and switched up and tossing the cake that had both me and my brother\u2019s name. \n\nI ended up hiding all the pink decorations, and leaving behind only the blue ones. And I also made sure to scribble off my name off anything I can get my hands on (like the banners, invitations letter, etc) so that only my brother\u2019s name and information was on it. \n\nAnd, on the day of the party, I rejected any gifts toward me and stated that; since it is my brother\u2019s birthday today, we should be celebrating *his* day since I hate celebrating my birthday on a day that isn\u2019t on my actual birth date. \n\nThis caused a mixed reaction to a lot of family members, but it ended with many respecting my wishes and focusing on the birthday boy.\n\nMy brother was the only one that was completely happy about it, probably because this is the first time that he was able to celebrate a birthday that was his own and he enjoyed getting all the attention for himself.\n\nMy parents, however, was livid at me for being petty and childish enough for wasting my time and money (and especially *their* money, with all the vandalism that I did) sabotaging this party. \n\nIn addition to that, they were also mad that I made them look bad, because a lot of our family are giving my parents flak for making it look like they are prioritizing my brother over me, as well as complaining that my insistence that they focus on my brother on *his* birthday to be unsettling and worrying. \n\nI mean, I think I may have gone overboard just a bit, but I don\u2019t think I did anything that wrong.\n\nAITA though?", "created_utc": 1681955621, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12shzl7/aita_for_sabotaging_my_little_brothers_and_my/", "score": 219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially in families with more than one child it is good to have that one special day for them (as long as they\u2019re not twins lol) Making you share your bday every year and saying it would be rude towards your brother but not towards you doesn\u2019t make sense at all.\nMany of your relatives not knowing when your actual birth date is sounds really sad.\nAnd I don\u2019t understand why the Celebration arrangements are so difficult for you guys. Me and my brother personally never celebrated big after we passed around 7/8 years old but that\u2019s mostly because we both are introverted with our whole family living in a different country. \nWhy can\u2019t your family just celebrate both your birthdays privately and separately as a family. And then the weekend after you can have the party.\nDoesn\u2019t that make more sense? You get your presents from family and some good friends (maybe invite your own friends for a casual hangout, nothing fancy) \nAnd on the party day people can give you your presents and wish you a \u201clate\u201d happy birthday.\nNow that you are 17 it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much anymore cuz you already did it the other way for the past 12 years and you\u2019ll be an adult soon. But maybe suggest other options to your parents.\nI don\u2019t wanna call them the AH, since you didn\u2019t give that much information on them or how much you actually argued / discussed this.\nAlso giving your brother the spotlight today was a very nice and sweet move. That was probably one of his best presents to have his day be HIS day.\nI hope your next birthday will be better.\nHappy birthday to your brother.\nAnd happy birthday (in 2 days) to you", "NTA Your parents have been deluding themselves for 10 years that what they were doing was fine.\n\nWhenever you tried to confront their delusion they told you to stop being childish and selfish.\n\nSo you confronted their delusion in public and they found their behaviour indefensible. \n\nThat's why they are mad.

Their birthday often fell on or close to Memorial Day so people expected to be celebrating. \n\nOur babysitter/nanny (I never know what to call her bc she\u2019s family and was my neighbors grandma and basically more of a parent than my parents) every year baked a cake for my sibling\u2019s birthday and mine regardless if we finished the first.

It's true that a compromise can only be reached when both parties are willing to engage in open and constructive dialogue.

It may be helpful to involve a neutral third party, like a family friend or counselor, to facilitate the conversation and help both parties understand each other's perspectives.", "You're right, leggyblond1. It is indeed difficult to find a compromise when one party is unwilling to consider alternative solutions. In light of this, OP's frustration is understandable, and it's important that they continue to express their feelings and the need for a fair solution.\n\nOne potential strategy would be for OP to have a conversation with their parents during a non-stressful time, explaining the impact that the current situation has on them and how it affects their relationship with their brother. Involving a neutral third party, like a family friend or counselor, could also be helpful in facilitating a productive conversation and finding a solution that satisfies everyone involved.", "Also this person only ever allowed to celebrate her birthday on her sisters birthday, open her presents on her sisters birthday and then her actual day ignored to the point her relatives don\u2019t know her birthday.

Your brother appreciated it, and I am curious how many relatives actually asked when your birthday really is and apologised to you for forgetting in the first place. Also, your parents are huge AHs for this whole situation to begin with and I wonder if anyone realised and told them off for it, was their any weird tension over the years between your parents and a relative?", "Atheist and anniversary is in November.  We tried planning number 2 to be June - September but miscarried then fell pregnant for Jan delivery and weren't trying for number 3 but were celebrating hubby's new job and ended up with a whoops.\n\nETA, no matter how much planning we did, our kids were born in that window.
