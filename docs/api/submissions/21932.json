It is about each of you taking control in your health and life by changing your lifestyle for the better. If he refuses to loose weight you can do it all on your own it doesn't need to be a joint thing. It actually potentially worse to pin yourself against someone else as now if one of you quits you both will.\n\nStart working out in some capacity. Go for a hike and record how long you can go without having to stop. Keep doing it and record the difference each time you do it. Have fun, go somewhere to hike where hiking is the secondary activity and sight seeing is the primary. Look for lower calorie alternatives in all food. For instance instead of having white bread get brown etc. \n\nDon't measure your progress against someone else, this is your journey to complete it doesn't matter what is going on elsewhere. \n\nHere's the final thing, if you want to loose weight the only one who is going to do it is you. I'm sorry your partner is picking on your insecurities but tell them to stuff it and do what they want, and you can start your weight loss journey on your own if they don't want to join.\n\nIt takes time. Keep at it. Have fun. Track your progress. Don't compare yourself or listen to others.", "ESH. He's projecting his weight shit onto you.  And you respond like a toddler.", "Husband is definitely TA. Maybe you picked the wrong way to send your message to him, though. I wouldn't tolerate the disrespect either. But tossing his clothes is only going to give him more reason to pick on you and start petty squables. Get on Pintrest and look up healthy meal plans. Start going for walks or get on YouTube for at home workouts. Tell him you're done living this way, that you want to be healthy and lose the weight, and you'll do it with or without him.", "ESH.\n\nYour husband is a TA for shaming you. It is cruel and I can only imagine that his behaviour is some form of projection whereby he is taking his own insecurities and his own frustrations and unhappiness and projecting them on to you (Disclaimer: I am not a psychologist and I wouldn't dare to pretend that I know about these sorts of things).\n\nBut I feel throwing his wardrobe on the floor is a petty, immature act of defiance. It will only anger him and make him resent you more therefore creating additional tension.\n\nTalk to him. Tell him how his comments affected you. If you can make him understand how much he upset you, it should hopefully lead to a more positive outcome for you both.", "ESH\n\nHe sucks for targeting in on you about your weight\n\nYou suck because instead of having a serious conversation, you just throw his clothes on the floor. \n\nWhat does that accomplish for you? \n\nIf you did the same with him, would you want him to throw your clothes on the floor?", "ESH. I'm guessing that impulse control isn't either of your thing. It's time to learn some hard and fast rules to stop hurting yourselves. \n\n1. Don't do mean things to each other. \n2.

Look, I completely sympathize for the way he behaved toward you. However, throwing his clothing on the floor isn't going to be an effective solution to this issue. What it will do is cause resentment to further build between you. You cannot control your husband's behavior, only your own. You have told him he hurt your feelings.

You need to set some boundaries and have a conversation with your husband about what you\u2019re comfortable with when it comes to him talking about your weight. You also need to take responsibility for your own actions, blaming your husband for your binging is just an excuse.", "YTA. That\u2019s a two year olds reaction.

You shouldn\u2019t have thrown his clothes on the floor in reaction to his behavior though. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason a lot of women glow up after divorce. The men in their lives were sucking the life out of them. Stress and unhappiness can lead to weight gain. If you leave you may start eating better and feel more motivated to work out. Or maybe not. You do need to take a good look at this marriage though. Your husband is not nice.", "ESH, but he's worse if that helps.\n\nHe shouldn't be nasty verbally to you about your weight, much less physically grabbing you in a way you do not consent to. It is abusive and it's gross. \n\nHim, to his smaller partner \"You need to go on a diet\" \n\nA perfectly reasonable reaction is \"you need to shut the fuck up, keep your hands to yourself, and work on your own weight so you're less insecure and unpleasant.\"\n\nBut throwing stuff and acting like that does anything isn't cool, wrecking his clothes doesn't help you and it doesn't stop him.

Talk, like the adults that you are. Otherwise his behavior isnt going to stop. Trashing his things is, not the resolution you think it is.", "You went about this all wrong. \n\nDon't toss out his clothes, instead replace them with smaller sizes *evil laughter*\n\nAnd then get you both some counceling.

You only because you were mad, and yes you had every right to be upset and hurt, but you waited til the following day to take your emotions out after he left rather than confronting him in the moment. That seems childish. \n\nWhat he did and continues to do is way worse though. How can you continue to be with someone who is so obviously disrespectful to you and is ok with hurting you?? Your marriage sounds toxic AF and your husband is disrespectful and hurting you on purpose. Time to reevaluate if this is behavior you want to put up if you ask me!!", "Ummmm. I think you are both TA in different ways. He\u2019s being mean instead of supportive and deflecting his insecurities on you, and you are responding in a way that doesn\u2019t really fit the situation.\n\nI would have thrown out all his favorite foods and stock piled the fridge with salad (not the pre made ones with the unhealthy toppings and dressings but PLAIN lettuce). Make sure the fridge and freezer are full on rabbit food. Make sure the cupboard doesn\u2019t have any snacks past healthy protein bars, nuts without sugary things, lentils, no easy make foods, etc. Ditch the easy, pre mixed spices full of salt and MSG.\n\nThen I would watch him be pissed about not having any good food and only having healthy foods around, smiling, eating my salad, and saying \u201cI decided it was time to make a change! Where\u2019s you\u2019re gym bag? 2 hour workout let\u2019s go!

Get out from under the toxicity and you'll instantly lose 270lbs of bullshit. Bet the rest of the weight drops off when your cortisol dips when you don't feel guilty for existing in your body.

That needs to be a boundary for you, and talking is the start. I think a counselor is a good idea to work through these issues", "This is the logic of a petulant child. You\u2019re a married adult.

Plain and simple.", "Instead of wasting time pointing fingers at each other maybe it\u2019s time you both take responsibility for your own behavior.\n\nIt appears you\u2019re both just creating drama & competing for who can be the bigger asshole. FYI \u2014 throwing people\u2019s clothes around only creates a mess. Does exactly zero to solve the problem. Your husband needs to learn his words & actions hurt you. Maybe you should start by telling him that. In a mature & calm conversation.", "Yes, your feelings are based on what he said but you are responsible for your reactions to that. You made the choice to throw his clothes everywhere instead of talking to him and you made the choice to binge (whichultimatelymakes you feel a million times worse), that's not on him. You'll never get out of the binge eating cycle until you realise you're the one who is in control. You control how you react to things that happen and what people say no one 'makes' you do anything. Its an incredibly hard cycle to break but this is the perfect opportunity to start tackling it. Unfortunately i don't think your husband is going to be particularly supportive though as he treats you really badly so that makes it harder. You need to realise you ARE worth improving your physical and mental health, however that looks like for you.", "That\u2019s why you need to have an honest vulnerable conversation with him. Let him know it\u2019s not ok and how you feel when he says and does these things. Avoiding the conversation with excuses and assumptions isn\u2019t going to be productive. Maybe you need to have a few sessions with a couples counselor if he\u2019s not respecting your boundaries. I understand that food and weight issues are really difficult, my best friend has a food addiction. Hopefully you and your husband can figure out a way to support each other and find a healthy lifestyle physically and emotionally.", "an addict?", "Food is your addiction. I used to be a bing eater too. I ate my feelings. Can\u2019t blame that on anyone but yourself. Therapy and medication helped me.", "well, I certainly didn't plan on getting this fat"]}
