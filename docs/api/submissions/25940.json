But it\u2019s not just your POV that we have to consider.\n\nBased on your post, Chloe doesn\u2019t seem like the sort to actively cause disturbance. What you dislike is her inaction and passivity. I would infer based on the rules that you specifically dislike having to clean up after her to a certain extent (but not as if you\u2019re taking care of a very young child), and her being essentially a freeloader.\n\nI\u2019m sure this is not dependent on person. Chloe will be this way regardless of whether she stays with you or your sister. I can\u2019t tell if your sister resents these traits the way you do, but what we know is that she thinks she cannot handle having Chloe around in addition to her existing kid and an upcoming one. So both of you have your own reasons.\n\nThing is, I\u2019m sure your sister knows that as well. She\u2019s not wrong to try asking anyway. But YTA for showing your displeasure this way. Based on your post, this is likely a major contributing factor towards your sister thinking you\u2019re a prick. I\u2019m inclined to agree. Not to mention, she\u2019s probably experiencing heightened levels of anxiety at the thought that you\u2019re basically refusing to help despite the situation. Not saying you\u2019re obliged, but I\u2019m explaining why she may feel unnecessarily cornered.\n\nA better, more productive approach would have been to discuss this properly with no petty/childish antics. Clearly, both of you are not willing. If there are other potential living arrangements, both of you put in the effort to secure those. Be it relatives or whomever. If there\u2019s no other choice and it has to be one of you, then work out an arrangement. It could be monetary compensation, hiring a helper and splitting the cost, etc. And it will be independent of whichever role either of you take up, meaning that the compensation will not differ based on who ends up taking her in. This is to ensure fairness and minimise further conflict.\n\nTrying to avoid the issue and closing both eyes to how it impacts others, especially family members whom you don\u2019t seem to have beef with, is not the way to go.

It sucks, but not every single person can be responsible for an autistic adult. Nor should they be forced to be. Chloe and Demi will simply have to figure something else out.", "Gentle YTA here, because I *get* it.  But please think a little bit more about this. Are you setting these rules because you're setting her up to fail, or are you setting them up simply because that's what you truly expect from any member of your household?   Would these rules apply just to her or would you make these demands on any person living in the house?   If Chloe is eligible for assisted living because of a disability then she simply may not be capable of meeting those demands.  If she needs supervision or assistance in daily life tasks in a facility, then she will need them in your home as well, rules be damned.  If she can find and keep a job, she may no longer qualify for housing subsidies based on her disability.  If she chooses to go along with you on this and actually can work this much she may lose all or most housing, food, and income assistance *for the rest of her life.*  Is this the way you want to punish her for disappointing you?  So perhaps  you let her stay and then kick her out because she lost her job and broke the rules a couple times.  So now she's homeless, but the housing authority says \"Since you worked for those 10 weeks you've demonstrated an ability to work and we've taken you off the housing list, and cancelled your food card and disability income.  We will also be keeping all of your tax refunds until you've repaid all the checks you got while you were working.\"   I recognize that Chloe's your sister and not your child so she's not your responsibility, but is this really what you want to achieve?", "My first thought finishing reading this was: what is Chloe actually capable of? \n\nBecause Autistic covers a LOT of ground for support needs and abilities. \n\nAlso, do you/are you willing to actually help your sister be able to hit those targets. Because as an autistic (and ADHD) person married to another autistic person, both of us relatively low support needs, we both need tools, supports, systems and each other to help us get the things that need to be done done. \n\nAnd if your sister is high enough in the support needs that she might qualify for assisted living, have you and Demi looked into other programs in your area she qualifies for? Does she, should she, have her own social worker who helps with support needs, housing, and work? My cognitively disabled aunt belongs to programs and has a social worker so she can live independently, have a job, and someone to help with things like budgeting etc. \n\nWhy is you sister not also hooked up to your community\u2019s programs? Have you even looked into those things? I\u2019m confused about why you\u2019d be looking to put her away in assisted living, but none of the other in between options so many communities make available? What would happen to her if you and Demi were gone??", "Yeah it's probably less \"Chloe needs a job\" and more \"I need Chloe to get out of the house for at least 16 hrs a week and for me to not have to pay for it, nor supervise it.\" \n\nEverything else Chloe can do will cost money - school costs money, loitering is illegal, hanging out at coffee shops, etc. all cost money. It's even more expensive if Chloe needs supervision. And if Chloe has no money, OP will be expected to pay. A job for Chloe is the only thing that will even allow OP to break even. \n\nAdditionally, I don't blame OP for saying \"I need to be compensated for the cost of you living here.\" Chloe's unfortunate circumstances don't make OP's requirement a jerk move. \n\nOP is simply not required to subsidize her disabled sister, and you implying so is really unfair to OP.", "This is the best comment so far. And I really hope OP follows it", "Jumping on this to second it and also recommend looking for local nonprofits that serve adults with intellectual disabilities.

Niether sister signed up to be a parent for an autistic adult.", "Why does OP (or her other sister) have any responsibility for her autistic sister? It would certainly be nice if they did care for her, and if it were my sister I would do so. But it's their sister, not either of their daughters, so they have no obligation to help.", "I will first state I am autistic myself.\n\nWhat were the sisters supposed to do? What would you consider to be reasonable rules?\nI think Chloe could be held to some standards. OP shouldn't have to provide everything for Chloe, without having a single demand in return.\n\nI don't know what resources Chloe, Demi and OP have access to. Maybe they can find some help while waiting on Chloe being able to go in assisted living.\n\nAlso, Chloe has presumably been diagnosed while the parents were still around - have the parents made any arrangements?\n\nNAH", "For you and I, sure.  But for what sounds like a disabled adult who meets criteria for assisted living they might be nearly impossible to do.", "In Canada many on disability can work and qualify for social services. There are many benefits to working that go beyond the extra money. If you work too much it will get deducted from your benefits.  \n\nWorking gives structure and self esteem to those that are able to do so. Many employers get the wages of those with disabilities subsidized.", "Given that Chloe is autistic, it\u2019s entirely possible she still has a childlike mentality, thus the rules.\n\nThe first three are totally reasonable, but the fourth is probably going to hinder her from getting into assisted living, which is why I vote YTA.", "We're missing a SHITLOAD of information here.\n\nWhat is Chloe's ability?  I have a feeling that because she's on a waiting list for assisted living, she has no ability to get herself a job.  That she has a very strict routine and has a lot of trouble adjusting.  \n\nWe can't make an accurate judgement without this information.  However, I'm leaning towards YTA for how you are treating your sister.", "YTA.\n\nIf you don't want Chloe living with you, just say so.  You and Demi can work together to find Chloe alternative housing.  Making up bullshit rules that you know she can't follow just so you can kick her out and feel justified while doing it is extremely immature and harmful to your sister.", "YTA for sure.\n\nIf you want to say \"no,\" just say no. But don't set up your autistic, assisted-living-qualified sister to fail merely because you're too embarrassed to own your own opinion.", "Why bother with the rules, especially if they are only meant to sabotage her? Is it so you can have a clear conscience when both of you refusing to provide for her has a negative impact on Chloe? Either say you won't be able to take her in and be done with it or take her in and accept her disability.  You're not the AH for being unable to provide for her but are for playing games.", "INFO: Can Chloe reasonably do any of the things you are requiring? What level of support does she need? \n\nWhy not just be honest and say you don't want Chloe in your home instead of setting potentially unreasonable expectations so that you can kick her out as a punishment?", "YTA. \n\nIt seems like the rules were come up with solely to prevent her moving in with you, and not to actually fix your identified issue with her living there. \n\nRules for adults living with you should be limited to rules for common spaces or about things that impact you or your home's condition. Depending on her degree of impairment, it may be reasonable to say that, as an adult, she needs to pay some rent or share some expenses. She would likely need a job to do that if she is not receiving disability benefits. It is reasonable to say someone living with you needs to share in maintaining the common areas. Picking up after herself in common areas, and completing assigned chores in the common areas are likely reasonable, if it's within her capabilities. It's not really reasonable to police how she keeps her personal space, provided it is not so unsanitary that it's causing a health hazard or damage to your home (for example, saying no food left out is reasonable because it can attract pests). It is not reasonable for her to be required to make her bed every day- her failure to do so does NOT impact you, and if the very sight of it bothers you, ask her to keep her door closed. If you need her out of the house for some amount of time every week for your own mental health, and she's not reasonably capable of holding down a job, you might look into adult daycare facilities to give you respite. \n\nWithout knowing a lot of details about the specifics of your sister's disability, it's impossible to say if what you've proposed is even really possible for her to do.  Autism is an extremely wide spectrum with a wide range of impairments. Some people who are autistic would be able to reasonably do what you're asking. Some can't. \n\nIf she's too disabled to support herself and live independently, you can talk to APS, social services, or their equivalent where you are, and see if the current circumstance of the family no longer being able to reasonably house her might qualify her to move up the wait list for assisted living/ group housing, or receive additional assistance.", "YTA. Of course you are, you're knowingly setting your disabled sister up for failure, you're a massive asshole for that especially since its obvious you don't care what it does to her. \n\nI can imagine not wanting to have her live with you but has it ever crossed your mind to say no instead of this manipulative behaviour?", "You can get help other than assisted living.  I work for an Agency that offers a variety of services for people with developmental disabilities - and work with a lot of individuals who are not in one of our houses.  Check with your doctor to see if there is a Vocational Center or Day Hab program that can work with your sister.   This will foster independence and social connections which are important to everyone.  Don't give up on your sister and don't let her sit on her tablet all day.", "YTA \n\nWhy get her hopes up and move her in when you\u2019ve deliberately set her up to fail? That\u2019s not necessary.

Chloe is you guys' sister, not some stranger. And I get it, not being able to handle the amount a care a disabled person would need, but there are other options you two could look into instead of treating your sister like an unwanted dog. The fact that you set up a list of house rules that are meant to keep Chloe down is cruel. \n\nAnd if Chloe is disabled enough to qualify for assisted living, then maybe she can't adhere to all of the rules on her own. I'm sorry you are downright cruel.", "Ummm...do you have a good understanding of what your sister's support needs are at all? \n\nIf she's on a waiting list for assisted living it seems her support needs are quite high? If that's all the info I have. You do also NEED to find out and make sure she doesn't do something that would bar her from being able to take advantage of assisted living if she needs it (like if she gets a job...would that mean she can't get assisted living?).\n\nIf your expectation do not take into account her support needs, then yeah you're the AH.", "YTA\nNot for the first three rules those are for the most part pretty valid. The rule for holding down a job is an AH move. If she could do it she most likely wouldn't qualify for the assigned living in the first place. But also the main part that makes you an AH, you have no obligation to let her move in. Don't beat around the bush, if you don't want her there just say that. Doing a whole song and dance about it is completely unnecessary. Either way she won't be living with you cause you said it yourself she can't follow those rules.", "YTA. If you don't want to house her don't. But this seems cruel to do to someone who clearly has higher support needs than the average person if she's on a waiting list for assisted living. And honestly? Making her bed every morning and cleaning her room once a day seem overly controlling and petty. Who cares, as long as she's not eating in her room.\n\nAre there other services she qualifies for that would make the idea of her living there more palatable? Could Demi kick in to help you cover the cost a weekly cleaner, thus easing most of your concerns? Does she have a social worker who can help find her a job? I think you would both be letting her down if she ends up unable to care for herself alone.", "YTA. You're old enough not to play games. If these are the rules for living with Chloe, then both of you find a way give Chloe support to make sure she can achieve the rules that you've set. Or if the answer is a hard no, give a hard no. This is a human being, not an abstraction. Even if you find this situation burdensome, there's no purpose in drawing out this issue between you and Demi vs working towards a resolution that works for the both of your needs. But honestly you just seem like a cruel or ignorant person. Achieving 4) for persons on some ends of the spectrum is often not a matter of will but of ability, and asking someone to perform outside of their level of ability just to make an oblique point is messed up.", "YTA\n\nJust say \"no she can't move in\" if you don't want her instead of \"well, she coooullld if she could fly but since she's unwilling to learn to fly i guess she can't, so that's on her\"\n\nPick rules you know she could do. Not ones you know she can't.  That's just mean.", "Yta If chloe just didn't want to do these things/was lazy I would say you are reasonable to not let her live with you. It does seem clear that you know she can't meet your expectations, you're just playing games at this point. It's like telling someone they can only move in if they work 25 hours a day, you know they can't do that so you are effectively saying no with extra steps. \n\nIf you can't house her I think that's ok but all this nonsense you are doing is childish and mean. \n\nPeople saying to contact social services are not wrong but they are naive. Social services can not adequately cover everyone that needs them. That's why so many people go without. It is absolutely possible that Chloe ends up homeless. Many many disabled people end up homeless for years while waiting to receive help.

Some are rules that are imposed on us by government authorities, others are rules we've set, and, here's an important part, there's rules that are made in consultation with the adult.\n\nIt's not unreasonable to expect her to follow some rules that entail some responsibility; the reality is that there's a good chance that when she does get into housing, there will be expectations placed on her based on her ability. And staff can typically tell who grew up in homes where they had responsibilities and who grew up in homes where any failing was excused because of their disability. It's infantilizing to assume that because someone has a disorder that they cannot do something like clean their room.

And they should both be allowed to do so, guilt free.", "True. I just think OP's choice not to do so doesn't rise to the level of AH. It's just a bit weak and passive aggressive. And I find it justifiable given that Demi is yelling at her, and Chloe has already abused her hospitality once.", "... everything you said requires OP to bend over backwards and sacrifice herself to take care of Chloe. \n\nWhat does \"mentally and financially afford\" even mean to you? Does afford mean having just enough, or enough to give freely and comfortably? Is OP supposed to pinch every penny, and all her available mental energy to help Chloe? Is she supposed to work overtime? Not have kids? \"Afford\" is a matter of choices - what is OP required to give up to \"afford\" housing her sister in perpetuity?\n\nAnd if OP is at the end of her rope, why does she have to do EVEN MORE by looking into this alternative housing thing? \n\nNot wanting to is often then result of being emotionally spent. It still doesn't feel like a can't, it feels like a won't, so by your definition, OP will be TA until she can find someone else to offload her sister to, or until she just bites the bullet and gives up her life for her sister.", "i hate how this country treats disabled people. i\u2019m happy you and your mom found something that works for you two regarding your situation. i love hearing that things are working out the best they can :)", "They aren\u2019t the same thing though. In the unable to accommodate scenario, it has to do with making expensive and structural changes to a home. In the example of \u201cimpossible conditions\u201c, she is not unable to accommodate without dramatically altering her home, she is choosing to use rules to exclude her sister.  That is a completely different thing.", "Op could've just said that living with her wasn't a viable solution, not ask her sis to do something she's not capable of", "Because they are the only source of support or care for their disabled sister right now? Like damn. They\u2019re not ~required~ to do anything, but leaving their disabled sister to suffer and fend for herself without support definitely makes them assholes.", "THIS   Why does it fall the the youngest sibling, who has never lived a day without Chloe taking priority, to be the one who shoulders the responsibility for getting Chloe taken care of -- why is the \"mental load\" all on her for this situation?", "> ... everything you said requires OP to bend over backwards and sacrifice herself to take care of Chloe.\n\n\nHelping anyone requires sacrifice. I'm not sure what your point is here. \n\n \n> What does \"mentally and financially afford\" even mean to you?\n\n\nIt's not about what it means to me, it's about what it means to her. She's allowed to have her own definition of what that is, and if taking her sister in encroaches on that, she's allowed to say she can't do it. \n\n\nNeeding to work overtime, being unable to have kids, giving all of her mental energy are all pretty valid reasons for being unable to care for her sister. \n\n\nBut if that were the case, she would just say so. \"I'm sorry, I can't afford to care for her long term, she needs too much help that I'm unable to provide. Let's come up with a plan to see if there's an alternative\" \n\n\nInstead her post is \"my sister is so lazy she won't clean her room!!!.......also she might need professional mental care due to being so far on the spectrum.....but her laundry is on the floor!!!\" \n\n\n> Not wanting to is often then result of being emotionally spent.\n\n\nDid OP say they were emotionally spent? No. \n\n\n> OP will be TA until she can find someone else to offload her sister to\n\n\nI mean yeah, wanting to offload your severely autistic sister because she doesn't make her bed is going to get you called an asshole. You and OP need to accept that.", "She could have, but that opens her up to more abuse from Demi. I just don't see why OP should always have to choose making things easier for Chloe over making things easier for herself.", "But this view is hugely problematic for the siblings of disabled people. You're basically saying that OP and Demi can't be NTA unless they take responsibility for their sister for the rest of their lives. Why don't OP and Demi get to prioritize themselves, their partners, children, career, travel, anything besides being a nursemaid their whole lives? \n\nIf that's what's required to NBTA, I would just choose to be an AH and not look back. I'd probably then need therapy to not hate myself thanks to people saying stuff like your comment -_-\n\nI really wish there was more sympathy for the siblings of disabled people."]}
