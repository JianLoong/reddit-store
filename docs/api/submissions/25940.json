That's the nature of disability.\n\nYou should also contact your local social services and see if her impending homelessness opens any resources for her.", "NTA but I think you and Demi need to be honest: neither of you want to live with Chloe anymore. I imagine that Chloe did not change while living with Demi and her family. The second pregnancy gives her a valid reason to move Chloe out. \n\nInvite Demi to coffee. Suggest that you both reach out to social services to report that Chloe can no longer count on living with family. Her case needs to be fast tracked to assisted living or a social worker needs to help her find affordable housing within the next 6 months.", "Does she receive any services, like therapy or case management?", "INFO.... is Chloe able to work? The rules dont seem extreme to me if she is able to do them. \n\nNTA\n\nThere are many people with autism that are capable and that benefit from working. I have cousins and nephews with autism and/disabilities that work part time. I do not know Chloe's circumstances though.", "NTA. While it\u2019s morally virtuous to take care of your sibling, it\u2019s not your moral obligation. Family needs to realize once you\u2019re grown you have zero responsibility to each other. Yes it\u2019s great when y\u2019all can cooperate, but if it\u2019s causing you problems, family can be cut out the same way anyone else is.", "NTA. Is it possible that you and other sister could split the cost of getting her a studio, small apartment near you? You could have a cleaner come once a week and order groceries for her online, so you know she's housed and fed but not living with you or other sister.", "NTA.  Clean your own room is not too big an ask. Eating in the kitchen or dining room is not associated with her autism.  These are behaviors she would have to develop in assisted living. Making your bed too. For whatever reason little has been asked of your sister.  If she is unable to do even these tasks, she needs more care than the average person is capable of providing.  I would strike the work thing and change the rule to participate in some activities outside the house.", "NTA. A structured living arrangement would benefit you both. If Demi disagrees, then Chloe should continue to live with her.", "ESH, except for Chloe.\n\nyou and your sister are just playing hot potato with the responsibility for your autistic sister. you're a bit more of an AH honestly for being passive aggressive and making a fake list of rules instead of just owning up to the fact that you don't want her around. \n\nHope that Chloe ends up finding a place that actually cares about her wellbeing since her sisters clearly don't.", "NTA", "As many things are, autism is a spectrum and it\u2019s not possible to tell from your post how it affects Chloe.\n\nWhat is clear, though, is that she requires assistance. If we look at the situation solely from your POV, some would say you\u2019re not obliged. But it\u2019s not just your POV that we have to consider.\n\nBased on your post, Chloe doesn\u2019t seem like the sort to actively cause disturbance. What you dislike is her inaction and passivity. I would infer based on the rules that you specifically dislike having to clean up after her to a certain extent (but not as if you\u2019re taking care of a very young child), and her being essentially a freeloader.\n\nI\u2019m sure this is not dependent on person. Chloe will be this way regardless of whether she stays with you or your sister. I can\u2019t tell if your sister resents these traits the way you do, but what we know is that she thinks she cannot handle having Chloe around in addition to her existing kid and an upcoming one. So both of you have your own reasons.\n\nThing is, I\u2019m sure your sister knows that as well. She\u2019s not wrong to try asking anyway. But YTA for showing your displeasure this way. Based on your post, this is likely a major contributing factor towards your sister thinking you\u2019re a prick. I\u2019m inclined to agree. Not to mention, she\u2019s probably experiencing heightened levels of anxiety at the thought that you\u2019re basically refusing to help despite the situation. Not saying you\u2019re obliged, but I\u2019m explaining why she may feel unnecessarily cornered.\n\nA better, more productive approach would have been to discuss this properly with no petty/childish antics. Clearly, both of you are not willing. If there are other potential living arrangements, both of you put in the effort to secure those. Be it relatives or whomever. If there\u2019s no other choice and it has to be one of you, then work out an arrangement. It could be monetary compensation, hiring a helper and splitting the cost, etc. And it will be independent of whichever role either of you take up, meaning that the compensation will not differ based on who ends up taking her in. This is to ensure fairness and minimise further conflict.\n\nTrying to avoid the issue and closing both eyes to how it impacts others, especially family members whom you don\u2019t seem to have beef with, is not the way to go. Be open to discussion and compromise. Your sister will stop thinking you\u2019re a prick then.", "NTA\n\nThose are basic expectations, and a pretty low bar.", "YTA: If she could work that routinely at a normal job, she'd probably wouldn't qualify for assisted living. Keeping the room clean is well and fine. But if she could work, she wouldn't be on the list. It's hard to get on that list.", "YTA. Chloe is a person and deserves to be treated like one regardless of how you feel about her. What you are doing is playing games with her. Simple childish games because you don't have enough spine to just say no to having her move back in. Oldest sis is right.", "YTA you're being unfair, be an adult and say you don't want her there if that's how you feel, don't put it all on your other sister, she's autistic and you're mad because she sits on her ipad as if you're her parent, fair play have rules like rent being on time but  'dedicate and hour to cleaning and must make her bed every morning' are you a dictator now", "YTA.\n\nIf you don't want to take Chloe in, then don't. \n\nBut if she's high enough support needs that she qualifies for assisted living, then your demands are basically asking a fish to ride a bicycle.

Just tell her that, don't be manipulative.", "NTA those are very basic rules that she should be able to follow.", "NTA. Your place your rules. End of story.", "Or you could treat her like an adult and say \"you can live here but you will need to pay rent.

It sucks, but not every single person can be responsible for an autistic adult. Nor should they be forced to be. Chloe and Demi will simply have to figure something else out.", "Gentle YTA here, because I *get* it.  But please think a little bit more about this. Are you setting these rules because you're setting her up to fail, or are you setting them up simply because that's what you truly expect from any member of your household?   Would these rules apply just to her or would you make these demands on any person living in the house?   If Chloe is eligible for assisted living because of a disability then she simply may not be capable of meeting those demands.  If she needs supervision or assistance in daily life tasks in a facility, then she will need them in your home as well, rules be damned.  If she can find and keep a job, she may no longer qualify for housing subsidies based on her disability.  If she chooses to go along with you on this and actually can work this much she may lose all or most housing, food, and income assistance *for the rest of her life.*  Is this the way you want to punish her for disappointing you?  So perhaps  you let her stay and then kick her out because she lost her job and broke the rules a couple times.  So now she's homeless, but the housing authority says \"Since you worked for those 10 weeks you've demonstrated an ability to work and we've taken you off the housing list, and cancelled your food card and disability income.  We will also be keeping all of your tax refunds until you've repaid all the checks you got while you were working.\"   I recognize that Chloe's your sister and not your child so she's not your responsibility, but is this really what you want to achieve?", "My first thought finishing reading this was: what is Chloe actually capable of? \n\nBecause Autistic covers a LOT of ground for support needs and abilities. \n\nAlso, do you/are you willing to actually help your sister be able to hit those targets. Because as an autistic (and ADHD) person married to another autistic person, both of us relatively low support needs, we both need tools, supports, systems and each other to help us get the things that need to be done done. \n\nAnd if your sister is high enough in the support needs that she might qualify for assisted living, have you and Demi looked into other programs in your area she qualifies for? Does she, should she, have her own social worker who helps with support needs, housing, and work? My cognitively disabled aunt belongs to programs and has a social worker so she can live independently, have a job, and someone to help with things like budgeting etc. \n\nWhy is you sister not also hooked up to your community\u2019s programs? Have you even looked into those things? I\u2019m confused about why you\u2019d be looking to put her away in assisted living, but none of the other in between options so many communities make available? What would happen to her if you and Demi were gone??", "Yeah it's probably less \"Chloe needs a job\" and more \"I need Chloe to get out of the house for at least 16 hrs a week and for me to not have to pay for it, nor supervise it.\" \n\nEverything else Chloe can do will cost money - school costs money, loitering is illegal, hanging out at coffee shops, etc. all cost money. It's even more expensive if Chloe needs supervision. And if Chloe has no money, OP will be expected to pay. A job for Chloe is the only thing that will even allow OP to break even. \n\nAdditionally, I don't blame OP for saying \"I need to be compensated for the cost of you living here.\" Chloe's unfortunate circumstances don't make OP's requirement a jerk move. \n\nOP is simply not required to subsidize her disabled sister, and you implying so is really unfair to OP.", "This is the best comment so far. And I really hope OP follows it", "Jumping on this to second it and also recommend looking for local nonprofits that serve adults with intellectual disabilities. There are two or three in my area, and they help with group housing, job training and placement assistance, and more. Even if social services is backed up, there may be other help in OP's area.", "I think its on her parents for passing away without a plan for Chloe. Niether sister signed up to be a parent for an autistic adult.", "Why does OP (or her other sister) have any responsibility for her autistic sister? It would certainly be nice if they did care for her, and if it were my sister I would do so. But it's their sister, not either of their daughters, so they have no obligation to help.", "I will first state I am autistic myself.\n\nWhat were the sisters supposed to do? What would you consider to be reasonable rules?\nI think Chloe could be held to some standards. OP shouldn't have to provide everything for Chloe, without having a single demand in return.\n\nI don't know what resources Chloe, Demi and OP have access to. Maybe they can find some help while waiting on Chloe being able to go in assisted living.\n\nAlso, Chloe has presumably been diagnosed while the parents were still around - have the parents made any arrangements?\n\nNAH", "For you and I, sure.  But for what sounds like a disabled adult who meets criteria for assisted living they might be nearly impossible to do.", "In Canada many on disability can work and qualify for social services. There are many benefits to working that go beyond the extra money. If you work too much it will get deducted from your benefits.  \n\nWorking gives structure and self esteem to those that are able to do so. Many employers get the wages of those with disabilities subsidized.", "Given that Chloe is autistic, it\u2019s entirely possible she still has a childlike mentality, thus the rules.\n\nThe first three are totally reasonable, but the fourth is probably going to hinder her from getting into assisted living, which is why I vote YTA."]}
