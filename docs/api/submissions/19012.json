Second, and I mean this genuinely,  how do you feel this would play out for your mom and the people you care about? Would your mother want her siblings there? Do you believe they'd ridicule her as you suspect? If so, then by all means push forward for her sake. It's an awful position to be in, but at the end of the day by the time this event rolls around you will be gone and sorely missed. Don't focus on spiting those who did you wrong in life, but on easing the loss of those you love after your passing.\n\nIf you do pursue the trespassing route, get your wishes notarized with a witness. Legally, two people who do not share your blood will have great difficulty enforcing your wishes against direct family members without proper documentation. \n\nAs someone who has been in a similar position, you have my deepest condolences. I wish you all the best.", "NTA, it's a time to celebrate your life and cherish you. they have no obligation to be there. especially when they want to come for ill intentions.", "Whew...this is hard. But I understand.  It's painful to have to even think of these things when you just want peace & solitude right now.  I know the hurt & I know the heartbreak so take my heart. I know what this truly means & it's not about this moment but a lifetime of \"should have been moments\". \n\nI too have made it to where my husband is not to let anyone, including my much loved children, know I've even died until 6 months after. No funeral, no wake...just cremate me & throw me over the Alabama Point bridge. \n\nThe reasons are varied - some about hurt, some about love - but they are MY (your) reasons. I watched my father wither & die over 2 yrs at a very young age & I just want to make sure my kids never endure that. \n\nSelfish? My oldest thinks so but it's something I feel strongly about. \n\nOther relatives....I just simply don't want people I've never been close to, who my only contact with has been other funerals putting on acts of caring & closeness at a funeral. \n\nSo I understand this but in reality, we will be dead, with no control & funerals aren't really FOR the dead, they are for the living. \n\nPlease just try to accept that people who aren't in your life now - for whatever reason - will one day face their own fate & answer for all things.  Live your days in love, forget those who really don't matter anyway.", "NTA. You are in a terrible situation and you know exactly who and how you want your memorial to be conducted.  You are really terrific person to be so concerned about your mother when she will be grieving *again*.\n\nYou are being a great person in a horrible situation.

Please, find ways to spend your remaining months sharing your love with them, filling their lives with lasting memories.\n\nEnd of life care often includes instructions for the funeral. I encourage you to write these out, in detail, including the addition of security guards.

In unlikely event that 1-2 of them attend, is it reasonable to expect your peeps to enforce your wishes?  Aren\u2019t you making them the assholes?

But I would advise you to try to organize as much of your funeral ahead of time. Avoid anyone you do not want there during your illness. Avoid posting to social media during this time as well. If they do not know about your illness they cannot anticipate your funeral.\n\nFurthermore, be sure to tell those who will be there not to announce your death until AFTER your funeral/burial. If no one knows you have died then no one will crash your funeral. They can pretend to mourn and miss you from their homes well after you are laid to rest. Leave the actual mourning and opportunity to celebrate your life to those who actually care for you.", "Mom is getting to the point where she wants nothing to do with them either, but wouldn't ask them to leave because, \"they're family.\"  And the only reason they ever talk to her is to bully her and make her feel like garbage.   \n\nAs far as getting it notarized I will keep that in mind, but I also know my brother will jump on the band wagon, too.  I just haven't discussed it with him because he will have way too much fun rubbing it in their faces and giving them more ammo against our mom.", "I understand. Given that, you're clearly acting on her best interests and should continue with your plan. I can't stress enough that getting your wishes notarized is key. Without a binding document, law enforcement will have to treat the situation as \"he said she said\". If your mom is reluctant to cut them out, she's unlikely to insist that the police remove these people. Even if she was willing, she will have enough on her plate that day without having to tresspass her family from her child's funeral.\n\nPlan ahead, entrust someone reliable with the notarized document, make copies incase it is lost or seized, and have that person you trust call ahead to local law enforcement to inform them of the situation so it doesn't come as a surprise should a call come in. Ideally this situation would be quickly and quietly resolved as opposed to becoming a spectacle that upsets your loved ones.", "If you can find a security service and hire them ahead of time for your funeral. Give that information to your brother and mother so they can inform them when they day comes. They can be the bad guys without your mom or brother being involved. They can say it was the deceased person's wishes.", "Thank you for the advice\ud83d\ude01\n\nThere's also nothing stopping them from having their own memorial service that no one else is invited to, just the people that will belive how much they loved and miss me. \n\nThat's what they did with my uncle who didn't want a funeral. \ud83d\ude44", "You're welcome, it's the least I can do.\n\nYou're right, there's nothing stopping them from grand standing and shedding crocodile tears at their own event. No need for them to make this one worse for everyone involved.", "Yeah, they steamrolled a lot of things my uncle wanted while snubbing his daughters in the process. He didn't want a funeral, he wanted a party, so that's what we did.  We found out later that they had a memorial service that they didn't even tell his girls about.  The girls found out when someone who was basically a stranger of the street showed them a video of it not realizing they weren't invited and didn't know about it.  Just thought they decided not to come.", "Sheesh. They sound like such a lovely group of people, I can't imagine why you're not their biggest fan. \n\nMy family is similar, so I can understand your frustrations. In the end people like them tend to get what they deserve if it's any consolation."]}
