She was upset, but that wasn\u2019t enough: she needed you to be as miserable as she was, and over some dumb snacks no less. It\u2019s not like she was going to starve without the snack she wanted.

She didn't want anything else when you offered, so why should you be denied snacks just because she *only* eats flaming hots? She had her chance.", "NTA. \n\nShouldn't the doordasher have given you time to ask for a substitute though? We don't have it in the UK but the similar services we do have give you like 2 minutes to tell them what you'd like instead.", "NTA\n\nThere's no need to inflict suffering on others just to make them suffer with you. She declined the offer to get something else. \n\nThe solution would have been to find a way for her to have a snack, but if she's refusing the options, why do you have to go hungry?\n\nHaving a tantrum about someone else having a treat that you don't have is a child's reaction, not an adults.", "NTA, it's not your fault the store was out.

If you had said your 4 year old was staying with you and this happened, you wouldn't be TA but this behavior from her would make more sense. Since she's an adult who was given the option for further accomodations (after the initial accommodation of you ordering them in the first place) and she chose no alternative other than to sulk, there's no reason to feel badly.", "NTA  I do not understand why guys keep girls like this around. Plan ahead for your snacks or be able to compromise. Pouting and lashing out are the actions of a child.", "NTA. She whined for Cheetos. You caved AND you paid. Now she is expecting you have wasted YOUR money. She is acting like a spoiled rotten child. Good luck", "NTA. \n\nYou offered to get her something else. She chose to not take you up on that.", "NTA and I'd like to add that this entire situation could've been easily avoided by just going to the gas station yourselves instead of having a few dollars worth of junk food delivered. Is this really where we are as a society?", "NTA I don't get why she's this upset over a bag of Cheetos. Like...this is a non-issue. If you have enough money to DoorDash a bag of Cheetos, you're clearly not starving.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
