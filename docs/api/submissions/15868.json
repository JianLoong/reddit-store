After a few horrible dates I found a guy that SEEMED great - sweet, willing to take things slow, charming.\nDated for about 6m before we had a bust up over nothing. I finally saw his bad side - a true sociopathic narcissist.\nThe last things he said to me were he didn't care about my feelings, he'd never change anything about our relationship because he was happy the way things were & that's all that mattered. He would keep being the same, even if he knew it made me unhappy. He didn't see any reason why he would care about my feelings when they didn't \"impact him\".\n\nI didn't want to deal with that, it wasn't worth it. At this point in life, I just wanted something easy.\nWent on my way, seeing it as a lesson learnt.\n\nBut, I found out I was pregnant. I have an 8yo son & having another child seemed financially & emotionally impossible. But I lost a child the year after my son was born & frankly never got over it properly.\nSo, I kept her.\nDespite the insistence of friends, I didn't want to tell the dad. He had proven himself to be mean, selfish & uncaring.\n\nHe has a son with his ex-fiance, he barely sees (the kids 3 & he's seen him 4times, he left his ex when she was 7m pregnant. He admitted to me once that he only pays child support so that the mother can't totally bad-mouth him to his son later on life \ud83d\ude44 I don't see how he would be any different with my child, so I left him out of it.\n\nWell, last week, the little lady arrived.\nWe're stuck in the NICU for a while, but she's doing well.\n\nAgainst my wishes, a friend put a picture on FB. A mutual friend between her & the dad asked about the baby & news eventually got back to him.\n\nTonight he called 8 times. I was almost sick when I saw his name.\nHe started texting & messaging. Eventually I answered, just to make it stop.\n\nWould've been easier to just say I cheated & she wasn't his, but I couldn't bring myself to lie.\n\nHe wanted to know why I didn't tell him I was pregnant & when I explained he went crazy, saying it was all untrue & calling me names. I put the phone down, he continued via text. I said if he wanted to talk he'd have to calm down. 2hrs later he called back.\nFirst thing he wanted to know was if I would be claiming child support \ud83d\ude44\n\nHe said his father had recently died & it had made him re-evaluate. I asked if he'd seen his son since we broke up in July? No.\nI asked, if anything, how much he wanted to be involved with my daughter & he simply replied \"I couldn't expect him to be the perfect father & see her all the time as he has his own life\".\nI fully expect it to be the same as with his son, less & less contact until it's non-existant unless he needs an ego boost.\n\nAre my friends right? AITA for keeping her from him? Im staring as this tiny thing in a hospital incubator & all I want is to protect her! I want her surrounded by people who love her & genuinely care about her. I don't think he can do that. Am I wrong?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sounds like you were just doing something understandable for the good of your daughter.\n\nFrom a legal perspective though, that might be different though.

Protect your child at all costs.\n\nIt all comes down to whether you're telling the truth about him. Is he really like that or are your feelings hurt from the break up and you're biased and painting him like he is this awful guy. I'm suspicious, 6 months is a long time to date someone before realising they have no empathy. How did you not see this sooner, did you have no conversations of depth?\n\nI just want you to realise what you're doing is a MASSIVE DEAL and so you need to be 100% ruthlessly honest with yourself. If your conscience is truly clean and he really is as awful as you say then nta.", "ESH\n\nI can\u2019t see any good options for you here. I understand your reasoning but still think the guy deserved to know. If you put him on the birth certificate, consult a lawyer and see what you can do to prevent him from claiming any rights. If you didn\u2019t name him on the birth certificate, that might be enough of a deterrent for him since he doesn\u2019t seem to care enough to fight for paternity rights.", "INFO - Depends, were you going to ask him for child support? If not, then absolutely not. If you intended to claim it though, yes YTA. Suddenly springing a financial burden on someone when they could have had months to sort things out, is shitty.

She isn\u2019t just YOUR daughter. It\u2019s his daughter too and he deserved to know about her.

He has both rights and responsibilities, which he can negatively wield.  Now that he feels betrayed, he may become vindictive.  Earlier notice, with the opportunity for him to surrender parental rights in exchange for relief from any child support would have been better.  Still, try to get him to surrender his rights so he has no levers to pull.", "YTA. Jerk or not, he's the father and has a right to know, and be involved in the childs life, unless the courts deem otherwise.", "Also, between this guy and the friend, I would seek therapy bc why do you have close relationships with these types of people? Something to think about", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\nI don't think you should have hidden it from him and I do think you owe it to your daughter to have told him and to maintain some kind of contact. Not for his benefit, but so that she grows to understand her parents (as complex as that is). \n\nHe seems immature and irresponsible but I think for your daughter, you can manage that relationship. Especially considering he's more likely to go no-contact rather than controlling.", "Are you really thinking hiding a BABY from the father was the right call? Yikes.\n\nYTA.", "NTA, cut off those friends they clearly broke your trust and allowed this abusive man to walk back into your life for answers that honestly he didn't need. There's going to be no action done to benefit the child. I'm honestly upset that they sent photos and posted them without permission.", "NTA\n\nI totally agree they shouldn't have gotten an infant mixed up with a potentially abusive man.\n\nThe only thing op did wrong is let anyone know who the dad was if she felt he was dangerous.  I loath dishonesty. If the only way to protect a kid is telling people the dad is some one night stand rebound situation,  I support that. Only op actually knows how dangerous the guy is.", "Done & Done.\nThank you.", "Not going for child support, I earn enough to look after us all, it's not an issue. I don't want his money or his time.\nI'm not looking forward to it, but I want to be honest with her if she ever asks about him.\nIf she wants to meet him & make up her own mind, I will have to live with it.", "I've spoken to my therapist & a friend who is a therapist & they have both classed his behaviour under that title - I had to research it to understand & I'd say I agree.\nI don't want her to have a yo-yo dad.

No issues.", "I don't need his money & don't want his time.\nHis name won't be going on the birth certificate, so here in the UK that means he will have no legal rights. I very much doubt he cares enough to challenge it, but if he does, I have all the messages from our relationship & from our interactions now, as record. I've got it.", "You should've heard the sigh of relief when I said I didn't want to claim child support. That told me all I needed to know.\nAs for my \"friend\", I feel like it would be a waste of what little energy I have right now. I've blocked her & cut her out of whatever I can. Why grace her with a response?", "Good advice. I'll keep it all away safe.", "True. She's now blocked & cut off as much as I can. I don't want to waste my energy on her.", "Well, now he knows & as I suspected he doesn't actually seem to care that much.\nI earn more than enough to look after us all & he barely works, so no point in child support.

I think.", "Not really.\nI'm of the belief that it's my body, so my choice in that sense.\nBut also, he said during our relationship that he didn't want more children & even said he'd encourage me to get my tubes tied if we ended up getting married \ud83d\ude02 I was pretty sure what his opinion would've been had I asked.", "Narcissistic abusers can play very charming people, and love-bomb for sometimes years before the mask drops and they only put in enough effort to keep you from leaving.  They overload you with affection and attention to get you emotionally addicted and then drop the act.\n\nThe children don't deserve to be left dangling on a thread by someone whose only interest is themselves", "It's called love bombing babe. And abusers can do it for years, until they get to whatever their personal threshold is, then the switch flips.", "I view fathers as real parents. My ex-husband is still heavily involved with our son despite our divorce & is an incredible father. He puts in effort, deeply cares about his child & you can see genuine love. He feels bad if he ever lets him down (not often) & we both put our personal differences aside for our boy. I have the experience of a true father with him, so I know what it should be like.\n\nAs for the narcissism, it's not a term I use lightly. I have spoken about all this at length with both my therapist & a friend who is a therapist & both classed his behaviour under those terms. I had to research it to fully understand & I do agree in retrospect. He is not a good person, hence me wanting him away from my family.\n\nI wasn't that hurt about our break up, which actually surprised me at the time. I thought I'd be upset at losing a relationship or at least angry at the wasted time, but it actually felt like a relief. As the other posters have said, I think I was drawn in by the love-bombing. A bad divorce after a relationship that lasted since I was a teenager, made me feel bereft, I can see now that he preyed on that. It was hard to see at the time.\n\nI know how big a deal it is. I've made myself a single mother of 2, by choice! It's not been an easy decision or an easy ride. I don't have a family to support me other than my sister, so I did take the choice seriously.", "This is exactly what I wanted to say. And if it was a decision made simply to protect the child from the damage and heartbreak of an absent/narcissistic parent, or was it to spare OP having to deal with their ex?", "He won't be on the birth certificate. I've already looked into that.\nI can't imagine he will care enough to bother.", "Nope, no child support. I earn more than enough to support my family & he only works when he feels like it, mostly lives off welfare. I don't want his money or his time. I guess that's how I sold it to myself - I don't want anything from him, not even his time.", "He has no rights anyway. In the UK, if we're not married & I don't name him on the birth certificate he has no legal foot to stand on.\nI've already said I don't want child support (I earn more than enough & he's on welfare most of the time, so very little point in bothering). He has nothing over me.\nHe has no rights & doesn't want the responsibility.", "Do you really think he is fit to be a parent?", "Already on that.\nI have a therapist & we are exploring why I feel the need to \"collect broken things\" as she puts it.\nApparently having an abusive mother & a checked-out father, who left me to care for a disabled sister, doesn't help. I'm being looked after.", "There is no uncertainty in paternity here.\nAnd I do believe I am protecting my child from this person. He has serious issues, that he admits when he wants sympathy.\nAs for legally binding, he has no rights as of now & he will have to make an effort to get them, an effort that I cannot see him making. He has never bothered with his son.\nI've taken legal advice & from the messages & texts I have from during our relationship & from recently, my solicitor says it's unlikely he'd be awarded anything. \nHe has shown no interest, other than to cover his arse over child support - not that I've asked for it or even want it.\nHe has asked about money, he has called me names, he has blasted my phone & my friends phones with disgusting messages, yet at no point has he asked about the child. He hasn't even asked me her name. Let alone how she is, why she has been put in the NICU, if there's anything he can help with?\nMorally correct & Best for my child are not the same thing here.", "If he bothers & puts in the effort, then he can have contact. But he'll have to be consistent. No yo-yo parenting like he does with his son.\nBut I doubt he will care enough to try. Something will happen next week & his attention will be drawn away.\nIf/When she asks about him I will do my best to be honest & if she wants to meet him & make up her own mind I'll support her. That's the best I feel like I can offer.", "I'm thinking that protecting an innocent child from a damaging person was the right call.\nBetter an absent father than a disappointing one.", "I'm upset too, but I feel like no response is the best response. I've blocked & cut her out as much as I can. She knows what she did & why I'm mad. We have nothing more to say to each other.", "That was such a huge violation of trust and safety. I'm glad you took those measures. But be prepared with a lawyer.", "[deleted]", "That's very similar to the US. Your 'friend' (who I'd cut off for making you deal with this mess while your newborn is in the hospital) just put the ball in your ex's hands, as it were. It's now up to*him* to take*you* to court to establish paternity. At which point the court is liable to issue a CS order, as he would then have rights and responsibilities, but wouldn't have custody. And it sounds like you have more than enough ammo to prove that shared custody is not in your daughter's best interest. That's if he even takes it that far. Stop talking to him and just say if he wants in your daughter's life, he needs a lawyer and you'll see him in court.\n\nIt might be worth your time to contact your daughter's half-brother's mom and let her know your daughter exists. She may do nothing with that info, or she could help you keep your mutual ex from traumatizing your daughter as he's done his son. And the half-brother might want to meet his sister someday, or vice versa.\n\nCongratulations on your daughter.", "Say you want money if he wants contact. Might solve the problem.", "Seems like you have your head screwed on straight, just got suckered by a bad dude, you wouldn't be the first. Trust your gut and protect your child.\n\nOn another note, super concerning that my original post got down voted. At least OP is taking this seriously, other seems very casual about the idea of one parent unilaterally violating parents rights based on their own diagnosis when there is clear reason to be biased. I guess its cos its a man, very sad to see this sexism still alive...", "Good thinking. You don\u2019t owe him anything beyond the knowledge that she exists. Deny him contact if you think it would be better for her. You have clear evidence that might be the case. If he suddenly cares enough to sue for a paternity test to get rights and risk owing more child support\u2026 well you can meet that challenge if it arises.", "Then NTA.", "And being U.K., he can only be named on the Birth Certificate IF he is there when you register her OR if he gets a Court Order that his name should be added. \n\nIf he chooses the second option, then he would get all the things he doesn\u2019t want ordered as well - like a Child Support Order against him. Even if he\u2019s on Benefits, there is a minimum that he would be forced to pay because it would be deducted at source.", "Not my call. I'm not family court.", "I didn't say they diagnosed him, I said they described his behaviour.\nThey have both read the messages & listened to the abusive answerphone messages from him.", "Good call on her half-brother, I hadn't considered that. It would be nice for her to have some sort of extended family.", "Exactly my thoughts", "And family court know him about as well as you do, so not really a valid point.\nHe has no parental rights, so he'll have to make an effort if he wants to be part of her life. I'm not worried, I doubt he'll even bother."]}
