{"id": 16005, "submission_id": "1337x2g", "title": "AITA for charging my 16 year old nephew rent to live with me?", "selftext": "In February my 16-year-old nephew moved out of my younger sister's home and came to live with me. My sister has 4 other kids with my nephew's stepdad. The oldest is 8 and the youngest is just a few months. My nephew and his stepdad both hate each other. \n\nMy nephew had been couch surfing with friends on and off for a few months before he moved in with me. My roommate moved out at the end of last year and I can afford the rent without him now so wasn't planning on having someone else move in. My nephew has a job and works around 20 hours a week. When I offered him a place to stay it was on the condition that he pays me 10% of weekly paycheck. His mom knows I am taking part of his earnings as rent and has no problem with it.\n\nHowever, my older sister (not his mom) found out I was charging him rent to live with me and thinks I'm an asshole. She says because he is still 16 nobody should be charging him rent. I disagree as he has a bedroom he can sleep in free of charge and where he can get all his food free of charge. He is choosing not to live there. He is choosing to live with me even though he knew upfront he would have to pay rent. I don't have any kind of custody and am not his legal guardian, his mom still is. My sister argues because I can afford to house him/feed him etc that means I'm charging him for no reason (I can afford it but not comfortably as my grocery bill has doubled and electric has gone up), and he should be saving or spending that money on himself. She also thinks he's not really choosing to live with me but rather choosing to live somewhere he feels safe (which is not with his stepdad) and that I'm making him pay for something he has a right to. This point makes me question myself as I somewhat agree. I know he would rather be living with his mom because they are very close but living with his stepdad has become too hard for him. He would probably live anywhere else right now. I am also the only relative that lives in the same town as his mom, so even if my older sister would happily let him live with her, she lives to far away. I'm his only alternative option that isn't his friends\u2019 houses.

He is a minor and I assume he already works 20h because he knows he has to fend for himself. He has shitty parents and it is very sad that your sister is not  defending him better at home. Please be a decent adult in his life. let him keep the little money he earns to save for whatever he needs. Do charge your sister if you want to.", "YTA - Poor kid is scared to be at home and you want to charge him rent? Not ok.", "YTA for charging a minor rent. His parents should be paying for him (whether you need it or not - his parents should be paying CS)\n\na 16 year old should be encouraged to finish HS, think about college/trade school, and working part time to start saving.", "Info- is his mother trying to fix things at home for him to come back (counseling etc), or did she just flat choose her husband over her kid?", "ESH,  except nephew.  Mom and step-dad should be paying you all his expenses if they are not willing to create a home where he feels safe.  You should be supporting him emotionally and getting financial assistance from the adults legally responsible for providing for the minor in your care. The stepfather should treat him better and not make his mom choose.  And mom should not allow her husband to run her child out of his own home.  Nephew has enough barriers in place right now; he doesn't need to feel like a financial burden or a payday on top of everything else.", "YTA.\n\nWHY, for the love of God, if you don\u2019t need the money, are you charging your minor nephew rent?! That\u2019s not the kind of thing a decent person does in the first place - much less does to a teenage boy who\u2019s been displaced from his home, *from his family*, because his parents have failed him!\n\nIf you do need money to offset the added cost of him living there, you get money from his parents. He\u2019s not an adult - *it\u2019s still their job to support him.* They sound like deadbeats, on top of being shitty parents.\n\nAre there no responsible, compassionate adults in this poor boy\u2019s life? Is it worth making your abandoned nephew feel like even more of an outsider, even more of a burden, even more like he can depend on no one but himself, for an extra $100-200 a month?\n\nUltimately, this is way more his parents\u2019 fault than yours - your nephew shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility. But now that he is, the kind, compassionate, responsible thing to do would be to insist that his parents cover his costs. Does he even want to be working 20 hours a week? That sounds like a lot for a high school kid.", "YTA. This kid wanted to live with you because you make him feel safe when home doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s a teenager who\u2019s still in school, working part time.

He's a minor.", "YTA - and if you need extra to cover his bills you should be charging his stepdad and mother, since they get child allowance or tax credits or whatever your country provides for minors.", "YTA you are taking advantage of a child who was seeking a safe place to live.

This is the epitome of kicking someone while they\u2019re down.", "Yeah, YTA. You\u2019re literally taking advantage of a child who had to, at 16, make the decision to leave his home with the people who are supposed to care for him, in search of a safer living arrangement.", "YTA. If CPS finds out about this, they could investigate you for financial exploitation of a minor and his mom for neglect. The child is a minor and he\u2019s still a dependent which means, his parent should be paying for the roof over his head, clothes, food, etc.  if you want to charge someone, charge his mom and step-dad but don\u2019t charge a vulnerable child.", "It really all depends\u2026is he saving his money for college? You might just tuck a bit of the rent he is giving you in an account to hand him back when he either heads to college or gets his own place.", "You're the biggest asshole. This kid, yes KID, lost his home and his sense of safety...and you're gonna take 10% of his earnings. Nah. You and his mom need to come to an agreement on payment...like child support. Don't take it out on the victim. Go give that kid his money back. Or save what you're taking from him to give back when he's ready to move out.", "YTA because you should be charging his mother rent, not him. She is obligated to house him in a safe place and if she can't provide that then she needs to pay you to support him. So yes, you deserve payment but not from a minor.", "So your nephew was homeless for a few months and his mom didn\u2019t care? And neither did you? You need to talk some sense into your sister and start giving a shit about this child! No he shouldn\u2019t have to pay you for a place to live (he is a CHILD!). If you really need the money and mom isn\u2019t willing to leave the abusive stepdad, then make them pay for him to stay w you. YTA", "YTA - you should be asking his mother to pay for the extra costs rent not your nephew", "YTA. He is a minor.", "Holy shit, you are YTA. This minor child left his house because the environment isn\u2019t safe for you and answer is charge him rent? God I hope this kid realizes how awful you all are and can a good life for himself without you", "YTA - If you aren't saving atleast half of that money for him later. \nCover what is an extra expense from that money and save the rest for his future.", "YTA, as is his mother. He is 16 years old. He should be safely living at home and going to school. You are charging a minor child to get out of a bad situation. That sucks. His mother also sucks for prioritizing a man over her child and allowing you to charge him for her mistakes.", "If his mom has such a problem she can pay you child support payments.", "This is a tough question.  In all reality, his mother should be paying you, especially if she's receiving money from nephew's father.  \n\nTo be honest, I think you would be better off opening up a bank account and have nephew pay 10% (and any extra savings he would like to put in) each pay day into that account for when he \"grows up\".  Put it towards a home later on or a car after he finishes school / uni.  And the idea being he doesn't touch that money at all, let it grow.  Ask him if he would like to save for a house or a car and that account not be touched until that time.  If he decides to buy a car, then ask him if would like to continue the saving for a house after he buys the car.\n\nAt least that way, you aren't making money off him but he is learning to save in a safe environment.", "YTA he's a minor.", "To be honest, I don\u2019t have enough facts to really make an opinion, but I would put yourself in his shoes for a moment. What you want someone to do for you (at age 16)?\nIf he doesn\u2019t pay for a month, what will you do? Evict him? Think about the potential courses of action and choose appropriately. What are the long term consequences with his sense of safety, family, your relationship with other family members. \nIt may be fine to teach him that things cost money, but once you have money, it isn\u2019t wrong to use it to help others out.", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH on this one. I don\u2019t think you should be charging rent to a minor, that\u2019s quite interesting. Maybe ask him to help with the groceries or something like that because now it\u2019s two of you there but not rent. The stepdad sounds like biggest AH for making it unsafe for your nephew to live there and make it so he can\u2019t see his mom or siblings. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call OP the AH, I would just stop charging the nephew rent.", "YTA.\n\nI understand that you need help with his upkeep. This is reasonable, but it should be gotten from your sister.\n\nIf he feels so unsafe that he is okay with paying you rent at 16, then somebody needs to alert authorities to this situation. There are small children in that home, and there is apparently something unsafe about it.\n\nAt the least, you need to ask your nephew some pointed questions.", " NTA 10% is less than $15.00 a week, and this is going by the federal minimum wage 7.25 an hour. The kid has no other bills and can spend the rest of his money as he sees fit.", "Go back and reread your post. How can there be any question YTA?", "YTA no doubt.  His mom basically abandons him and then you make him living with you a business reaction.  SMH", "YTA here but a way to turn that around would be if you were taking the money he\u2019s paying you and putting it into savings for him.  He\u2019s working 20 hours a week while attending high school and dealing with a lot of emotional turmoil.  Be the man for him that his stepfather isn\u2019t so that he learns how to be a man himself.", "YTA", "YTA - help the kid get a head, not make it harder for him.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA but I have 1 question for you.  \n\nWhat are you doing with the 10% he\u2019s paying you. You are NTA if you are setting it aside in an account that he can access at 18 for his future. YTA if you are pocketing that money. \n\nThis is a 16 year old kid with a rough home life and just wants to be somewhere he feels safe. Charging him rent for that is wild, when you are in a position to provide that and have it take no extra toll on you. Instead of rent, how about just making him buy his own groceries or splitting the grocery bill?", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you should charge your nephew. I think you should get money from his mom and from your older sister\u2014 who clearly wants to help:) It costs A LOT to feed a 16 year old\u2026 and there\u2019s a lot of extra\u2014 electricity, laundry, water etc.", "YTA", "YTA. I can\u2019t even imagine taking money from a teen who has no other way out. Disgusting behavior.", "CPS needs to be involved if he feels more safe couch surfing than being at home.", "ESH except the child. His stepdad sucks for \u201chating\u201d a child and disrupting his home life, his mum sucks for choosing the stepdad over her own son, you suck for charging him rent. Really, mum should be paying you what you need to cover his food as he is still a minor, this is definitely not his responsibility and to say he has a place where he can get free food and rent so he\u2019s choosing this for himself is utter bollocks, you know that that is not a safe place for him to be, he doesn\u2019t actually have a choice and you know this! That reeks of some mental gymnastics to try to justify what I think you already know is shitty behaviour on your part.", "YTA! HE IS 16 AND YOU ARE HIS AUNT!!!!!!", "YTA\n\nLet him put away money for his future so he can move out and declare him as a dependent on your taxes.", "ESH except the kid.\n\nWhere is his mother and why isn't she providing him a safe living environment? If her partner is more important than her kid, she can at least pay you to help house her kid.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t be charging a 16 yo rent.", "YTA. Poor kid has nowhere safe to go", "So his options are to couch serf and not have a stable home, pay rent at 16 or live in an unsafe environment. That poor kid.", "Your nephew doesn\u2019t feel safe at home. So his options are shelter\u2026or couch surfing. You don\u2019t have to provide housing for him, but since he is still legally a child\u2026you might want to. Mildly TA", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not really rent is it? It sounds like he\u2019s basically paying a flat rate for you to feed him. \n\nSo, either charge him that, or let him live there for free but he has to buy all his own food, toiletries and utility usage. \n\nSounds to me like he\u2019s getting a great deal. And if he has no issue with it, then everyone else who are not him can butt the fuck out.", "Why so many Y T A? This isn\u2019t that much and it teaches financial responsibility. I agree to try and get the mother to pay\u2026 but I\u2019d say NTA. He\u2019s not your kid and you\u2019re being reasonable", "morally evil", "YTA. He's sixteen. He's uncomfortable at home, and he felt comfortable enough to stay with you. But instead of offering him a safe space, you're taking his money when you don't need to and probably making him feel like a burden. Why not have him contribute to chores or things that need to be done around the house instead?", "YTA. He\u2019s 16.", "YTA. Poor child.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t charge rent to minors. You charge their parents or not at all. This is a truly hideous situation and you\u2019re taking advantage of a child.", "YTA and so is his mom and stepdad \n\nThis poor kid is struggling and your taking money from a 16 year old? Charge the adults, not the child. \n\nHe needs someone on his side, be that person", "NTA\n\nSounds like your older sister likes to complain when she doesn't have skin in the game. \n\nA simple response is that the expense for nephew is X dollars per month, so is she willing to send that much? Split it with you?\n\n10% of paycheck really isn't all that much and it probably helps him feel better about his decision, because like you said, he has a room at home that he can use for free. He's old enough to understand that while he has a right to food and shelter, you are not the person obligated to provide it. \n\nIf you really feel bad about taking his money, just keep it in a savings account and give it to him as a gift when he leaves for college, or whatever. \n\nEnjoy this time with your nephew!", "I\u2019m a mom, 10% is fair. He\u2019ll feel more independent and less of a burden and will have less of an incentive to spend frivolously. Those are all good life experiences for a guy with a paycheck that in reality wouldn\u2019t cover rent on his own. And he\u2019ll be getting that, food, utilities. And peace.", "The only way you\u2019d not be the AH would be if you save every cent he gives to you so that when he moves out, he has a pot of gold. It\u2019s still an awful thing to do. I pity him as his family sucks.", "YTA. I\u2019d be asking his mother to help cover costs and not take the child\u2019s money, sure if mom can only cover the basics he can pay for other things like his cell phone but not rent.", "YTA. You're taking advantage of a vulnerable kid in a bad situation and profiting. Do you care about your nephew at all beyond his paycheck?", "I'm going to go with a borderline NTA. Personally I would not consider charging rent in that situation, but I do understand that you are incurring some cost by housing him (increase in utilities, food, etc). With that being said, you are helping him escape a likely toxic household so you should be commended for that! If you are having some doubts on the morality of the situation, I suggest putting a portion of his \"rent\" in a savings account to set aside for him as downpayment (security deposit/first month/last month and all that jazz) on his own place when he wants to leave.", "NAH- I think everyone is saying YTA based upon a 16 year old having to pay their own way, and of course that shouldn\u2019t be happening. But you also should not have to part with money to make this situation work when it is not your doing and you are trying to help. \n\nYou say costs have gone up since he moved in, understandably, and this puts more pressure on you and is probably now costing you savings etc. so it\u2019s affecting your quality of life or ability to get ahead. Covering this extra cost should fall on your sister (the boys mother). Your nephew is a minor and she is solely responsible for the cost of raising him/ his living expenses.", "NTA. 10% of nephew's paycheck for room and board is very reasonable, and probably makes him feel he is paying his own way, which is very empowering. If his aunt wants to pay his way, that's up to her and him. She wants to intrude, so why doesn't she go directly to nephew and sent him the money to pay you with, if it bothers her so much.", "NTA you're charging him like 80$ a month, people need to chill, just covering some of his groceries.", "NTA. He will appreciate the experience of budgeting. However. I might be putting some of it away for him if you can afford to, that is if you don\u2019t NEED the extra loot to pay the rent. If you can put enough away for him that he\u2019ll have the dough to bankroll his own spot in a couple years that would be clutch.", "NTA. If your sister is so upset then she could be sending you some money to cover for the extra expenses. \nIt\u2019s easy to have an opinion but at the end of the day no one else is stepping up to help your nephew.", "YTA and so is his Mother+Step Dad!\n\nI hope you're taking that \"rent\" and saving it for him so he has some money saved up when he leaves and goes no contact with those who took advantage of him while he was in such a shitty position as a CHILD... like you are.", "YTA - but if you want to do something nice, save all that money he\u2019s paying you and give it to him as a graduation gift.", "YTA But if you're having trouble affording your nephew's needs, I think you should ask your older sister to help contribute. She's clearly concerned about him too, and it shouldn't fall squarely on you to provide for him.", "I\u2019m going to be extremely blunt: Thank goodness you aren\u2019t my aunt.", "YTA and that\u2019s probably illegal anyway\u2026 poor kid", "YTA\nHe\u2019s a minor. A family member who needs help. You indicated this is not creating a financial hardship for you & you still choose to charge him?

In my state, 16 year olds can sign a rental agreement. You can access Government payments for income and rental support. If you end up in crisis accommodation or medium-term accommodation you actually have to pay for lodgings out of your government benefits, which amounts to 15-25% of income received. This is part of developing life skills. Not enough information in the OP around entitlements and other situational stuff to say Y T A.", "NTA\n\nBut his parents should be chipping in some money.\n\nI presume older sister is not volunteering to take nephew in.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced the nephew should be giving money but I understand the reasons why 16 yr olds will eat you out of home.", "nta.  Your nephew and his mom seem to be fine with itand it's really none of your other sister's business.  If it's that important she can move back to your town so he can live with her and be close to his mom.", "NTA.  The OPs logic is just fine.  The older sister needs to butt out unless she is willing to be part of the solution.", "NTA\n\nHe wants to live with you, he can pay something 10% is not much at all.\n\nHis mom should be paying you for his expenses however.\n\nNow, if he doesn't feel safe around stepdad? That really paints your sister in a bad light, letting him treat her son poorly.\n\nOr is it just a case they don't get along, and they just argue all the time? If that's the case having consequences for not wanting to live there is perfectly valid, doesn't matter if he is a minor or not.", "NTA. It's 10% of the money he makes. It's not a flat fee. I don't really get the many YTA replies here. If he can work, he can contribute a bit. 10% is a symbolic gesture more than it is a real help for the household. OPs cost went up and he has no obligation here  The other sister is complaining, but is she helping in any sort of way ? Maybe she can give the 10%. Can't the mother help with a bit of cash ? You seem to be the only one taking responsibility on the kid while everyone is just pointing fingers without actually helping out.", "NAH I don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019re the asshole but I also think if you can afford it.. don\u2019t let him pay. His mother is the AH here CANT believe she\u2019s letting her child go stay somewhere else and pay for it. He\u2019s 16 working 20hrs. Maybe you could help him save up a bit and when he\u2019s older (if he plans to stay for long) then start charging him. But you\u2019re not entirely wrong for charging him ofc you have your own money but doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to do this favour. Ultimately it\u2019s your choice there\u2019s nothing wrong with you charging him since it\u2019s 10%. Since you said that you can\u2019t afford it comfortably the charging would be the right decision for you.", "NTA   so is your older sister stepping up to take him in rent free?", "NTA first of all your sister should be the last person to complain - she should be paying you child support for letting her son live with you. Having said that - I've actually been in a similar position and I didn't charge the teen any rent, and I wish I would have. It would have helped them learn better financial management and I think they would have been more appreciative. Instead after 2 years I ended up with an 18 year old who was ungrateful, unappreciative, had zero financial management skills and is now couch hopping from friend's house to friend's house", "NTA. These same people calling you TA wouldn\u2019t take other people in who isn\u2019t there responsibility and take the burden for all the cost of food and extra utilities and stuff. Honestly 10% isn\u2019t much at all that\u2019s probably less than $200 a month. How about just make him buy all his own food and stuff for the house like toilet paper, paper towels milk and stuff. You will probably save more money by doing that and you don\u2019t have to say rent", "NTA. Bout to be an adult and 100% responsible for self. You're teaching a valuable lesson. 10% ain't shit. Have no other bills, so all the money is theirs to spend on whatever they see fit. Keep doing what you're doing. This kid needs you.", "NAH\n\nIt is great that you are willing to have yuor nephew live with you.\n\nI get where your older sister is coming from and it is also great that she cares about her nephew.\n\nYAs you say your nephew could live at home, he is choosing to live at your place. Frankly at even more than 10% of his income he is doign quite well out of the deal. Yes he is a kid but it is good experience for him to learn in a sfae environment how to pay his own way.", "NTA,  10% is reasonable,  if I understand right you are still paying a good part of what he needs (food, utilities  etc. ).\n\nHe agreed from the beginning and it is your sister she one with an issue there... as long as your nephew any you are on with the agreement I don't see the problem,  you are helping him and also showing him that his decision is moving out comes with responsibilities.  \n\nYou mention tat you can afford the rent but that you can not,  easily,  afford all the extras of having him live with you. \n\nWould you charge him rent if you could easily afford the whole?", "NTA. Just because other people would not do it, does not make you an asshole. Like for me, personally, I would never charge a family member rent to live with me, but I wouldn't deny if they offered either. But also, I don't think that someone IS an asshole for asking for a small portion. You still have bills to pay and it's not fair to you to pay his portion of his light and water usage. If you were asking for half his check, sure that might be mean. He's just a kid still.

My sister has 4 other kids with my nephew's stepdad. The oldest is 8 and the youngest is just a few months. My nephew and his stepdad both hate each other. \n\nMy nephew had been couch surfing with friends on and off for a few months before he moved in with me. My roommate moved out at the end of last year and I can afford the rent without him now so wasn't planning on having someone else move in. My nephew has a job and works around 20 hours a week. When I offered him a place to stay it was on the condition that he pays me 10% of weekly paycheck. His mom knows I am taking part of his earnings as rent and has no problem with it.\n\nHowever, my older sister (not his mom) found out I was charging him rent to live with me and thinks I'm an asshole. She says because he is still 16 nobody should be charging him rent. I disagree as he has a bedroom he can sleep in free of charge and where he can get all his food free of charge. He is choosing not to live there. He is choosing to live with me even though he knew upfront he would have to pay rent. I don't have any kind of custody and am not his legal guardian, his mom still is. My sister argues because I can afford to house him/feed him etc that means I'm charging him for no reason (I can afford it but not comfortably as my grocery bill has doubled and electric has gone up), and he should be saving or spending that money on himself. She also thinks he's not really choosing to live with me but rather choosing to live somewhere he feels safe (which is not with his stepdad) and that I'm making him pay for something he has a right to. This point makes me question myself as I somewhat agree. I know he would rather be living with his mom because they are very close but living with his stepdad has become too hard for him. He would probably live anywhere else right now. I am also the only relative that lives in the same town as his mom, so even if my older sister would happily let him live with her, she lives to far away. I'm his only alternative option that isn't his friends\u2019 houses. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He's not gonna be grateful to OP for charging him money.", "This is a good idea. Shove the rent into an account he can have on his 18th birthday is a good idea. That is of you can afford to. Its up to you if you tell him in advance.\n\nIf you tell him explain until he's 18 his patents would have to be on the account otherwise.  This just skips that scenario since the parents are an issue. Show him the  documentation to prove that.", "I like this idea. Put nephew's rent money aside for him and give it to him for his graduation gift or whatever. If aunt wants to pay his way, put that money aside.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They are the ones responsible for financially supporting the son if they are still alive and mentally capable of holding a job.\n\nYou should be invoicing the parents, not the son.", "YES!!!  Mom should be paying, or his dad directly to you", "That\u2019s what was supposed to happen when I lived with my aunt and uncle, and my Nana and grandad when I was 16. My mother was supposed to pay them the child support she received from my dad.", "No we don't.  I don't know if I can say without getting banned, but it is very much a particular breed of people.  But no, all of us Americans do not freeload off of children", "I mean, there\u2019s nothing more American than building your wealth on the backs of the less fortunate.", "Why his mother can't do that? If OP needs money he should ask to his nephew's mother not his aunt. What kind of logic is that?", "No the kids parents who are not providing a safe place for him should be paying. Not the kid.", "A decent person doesn't charge their minor nephew rent if he needs to get out of his house. There's obviously something going on between him and the stepdad. OP is legally in the clear, but this is \"Am I the asshole?\" not \"Am I legally in the clear?\". OP is the asshole here.", "Op is not taking a 'financial hit'. As is stated, he can afford to not  charge rent.", "Exactly.  AITA is so dumb sometimes.  Imagine calling someone an AH when he is taking on huge responsibility and cost like this.", "And when minors don't have parents, the obligation falls to the State. Emancipation doesn't absolve society of responsibility to children. Yes, OP has new costs associated with taking the kid in, which entitles reclaiming them via Child Support from the \"living\" mom that abandoned the kid. Are there arguments to forgo that process, yes, but those don't justify making the kid's situation worse by forcing them to choose between being a 16yr old and completing high school of working so they aren't homeless.", "So your nephew staying with you is probably only for the next 2 months and you still charge him?", "So she can pay you. Do not charge the kid.", "This needs to be in the post. YTA - if step-dad is that bad and mom is exiting then this is just helping family out. If you are trying to teach the kids fiscal responsibility, set the money aside and give it back after his mom moves out.", "So you're even more of an asshole than previously suspected?", "Sounds like groceries and utilities included in the rent. I don't think OP is a AH for wanting increased costs covered but she should be getting that from parents not child. But a mess if stepfather and mother don't want to pay.", "In the US almost always, exceptions are made mostly for actors, the parents can take minor children's entire paychecks. I wouldn't charge this kid but 10% of 20 hours probably barely pays for his groceries although imo his mom should be paying child support. It doesn't sound like OP can take on this extra expense without a little help. If OP was charging more than 10% I'd absolutely be upset about it but that is a relatively minor amount really. I so wish this kid had a safe home where he was taken care of as a child should be.", "She absolutely should be. 16 year olds are minors, and their parents/guardians are responsible for their housing and food costs.", "I did read the post.", "But the post didn\u2019t ask if the mom is the AH (and she totally is fwiw), it asks about her charging her nephew rent.  Charging her nephew and wanting to be reimbursed by a responsible adult are two different things.  Hopefully she\u2019ll know to pivot to charging the mom and step dad now, but she only asked if she should be charging her nephew specifically.", "He will be grateful to get some cash he thought was ghost after a year or two to get his own spot no? It\u2019s been my experience that younger folks aren\u2019t so hot at saving dough. Dunno. *shrug*.", "I disagree. He\u2019s already being decent by taking this person in. Who knows what kind of adjustments he\u2019s had to make? At the very least, he would have to adjust his social life. Maybe he likes to do various drugs and can\u2019t do them now. Maybe the kid plays video games really loudly. It\u2019s just having almost an adult in the house. He\u2019s doing a good deed according to his own comfort level. \n\nHe went from living a comfortable life by himself, and 100% his own terms to living and not so comfortable life and having to deal with a whole other personality. Chances are, the kid\u2019s got some baggage due to his dysfunctional living situation.", "Christ, at least 46 people can\u2019t read.  \n\n\u201cI can afford it but not comfortably as my grocery bill has doubled and electric has gone up.\u201d\n\nDoes a guy have to be homeless in order for you to consider it a financial hit?", "She absolutely should be getting that from the parents. Not the teen making maybe $200/week.", "Yea there's gonna be adjustments for both of them. But charging a minor rent to get out of a bad situation doesn't sit right with me. The kid already has plenty of stress from the home situation, there's no need to add more.", "Again the parents should be paying not the kid", "These people aren't very bright.  They sit in judgement of others when they would never take in another person's kid or even lend them 500 dollars.", "That\u2019s still not the OP\u2019s problem.  If I\u2019ve learned nothing on Reddit, it\u2019s that blood ties mean nothing. OP is not obligated to take in another person just because he\u2019s related.  \n\nHe\u2019s already doing an amazing deed by having another person live with him. That means he has to adjust life around this other person.", "Nobody is saying that OP shouldn't be compensated for housing their nephew they're just asking the wrong person", ">That\u2019s still not the OP\u2019s problem.\n\nIt is because OP *chose* to have him there.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying. I am saying that the OP should not suffer because the kid\u2019s parents are assholes.\n\nIrrespective of principles, the kid is a financial burden.", "Would you rather the OP kick him out so he doesn\u2019t charge him rent?
