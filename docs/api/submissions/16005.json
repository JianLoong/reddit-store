{"id": 16005, "submission_id": "1337x2g", "title": "AITA for charging my 16 year old nephew rent to live with me?", "selftext": "In February my 16-year-old nephew moved out of my younger sister's home and came to live with me. My sister has 4 other kids with my nephew's stepdad. The oldest is 8 and the youngest is just a few months. My nephew and his stepdad both hate each other. \n\nMy nephew had been couch surfing with friends on and off for a few months before he moved in with me. My roommate moved out at the end of last year and I can afford the rent without him now so wasn't planning on having someone else move in. My nephew has a job and works around 20 hours a week. When I offered him a place to stay it was on the condition that he pays me 10% of weekly paycheck. His mom knows I am taking part of his earnings as rent and has no problem with it.\n\nHowever, my older sister (not his mom) found out I was charging him rent to live with me and thinks I'm an asshole. She says because he is still 16 nobody should be charging him rent. I disagree as he has a bedroom he can sleep in free of charge and where he can get all his food free of charge. He is choosing not to live there. He is choosing to live with me even though he knew upfront he would have to pay rent. I don't have any kind of custody and am not his legal guardian, his mom still is. My sister argues because I can afford to house him/feed him etc that means I'm charging him for no reason (I can afford it but not comfortably as my grocery bill has doubled and electric has gone up), and he should be saving or spending that money on himself. She also thinks he's not really choosing to live with me but rather choosing to live somewhere he feels safe (which is not with his stepdad) and that I'm making him pay for something he has a right to. This point makes me question myself as I somewhat agree. I know he would rather be living with his mom because they are very close but living with his stepdad has become too hard for him. He would probably live anywhere else right now. I am also the only relative that lives in the same town as his mom, so even if my older sister would happily let him live with her, she lives to far away. I'm his only alternative option that isn't his friends\u2019 houses.

He is a minor and I assume he already works 20h because he knows he has to fend for himself. He has shitty parents and it is very sad that your sister is not  defending him better at home. Please be a decent adult in his life. let him keep the little money he earns to save for whatever he needs. Do charge your sister if you want to.", "YTA - Poor kid is scared to be at home and you want to charge him rent? Not ok.", "YTA for charging a minor rent. His parents should be paying for him (whether you need it or not - his parents should be paying CS)\n\na 16 year old should be encouraged to finish HS, think about college/trade school, and working part time to start saving.", "Info- is his mother trying to fix things at home for him to come back (counseling etc), or did she just flat choose her husband over her kid?", "ESH,  except nephew.  Mom and step-dad should be paying you all his expenses if they are not willing to create a home where he feels safe.  You should be supporting him emotionally and getting financial assistance from the adults legally responsible for providing for the minor in your care. The stepfather should treat him better and not make his mom choose.  And mom should not allow her husband to run her child out of his own home.  Nephew has enough barriers in place right now; he doesn't need to feel like a financial burden or a payday on top of everything else.", "YTA.\n\nWHY, for the love of God, if you don\u2019t need the money, are you charging your minor nephew rent?! That\u2019s not the kind of thing a decent person does in the first place - much less does to a teenage boy who\u2019s been displaced from his home, *from his family*, because his parents have failed him!\n\nIf you do need money to offset the added cost of him living there, you get money from his parents. He\u2019s not an adult - *it\u2019s still their job to support him.* They sound like deadbeats, on top of being shitty parents.\n\nAre there no responsible, compassionate adults in this poor boy\u2019s life? Is it worth making your abandoned nephew feel like even more of an outsider, even more of a burden, even more like he can depend on no one but himself, for an extra $100-200 a month?\n\nUltimately, this is way more his parents\u2019 fault than yours - your nephew shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility. But now that he is, the kind, compassionate, responsible thing to do would be to insist that his parents cover his costs. Does he even want to be working 20 hours a week? That sounds like a lot for a high school kid.", "YTA. This kid wanted to live with you because you make him feel safe when home doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s a teenager who\u2019s still in school, working part time.

This is the epitome of kicking someone while they\u2019re down.", "Yeah, YTA. You\u2019re literally taking advantage of a child who had to, at 16, make the decision to leave his home with the people who are supposed to care for him, in search of a safer living arrangement.", "YTA. If CPS finds out about this, they could investigate you for financial exploitation of a minor and his mom for neglect. The child is a minor and he\u2019s still a dependent which means, his parent should be paying for the roof over his head, clothes, food, etc.  if you want to charge someone, charge his mom and step-dad but don\u2019t charge a vulnerable child.", "It really all depends\u2026is he saving his money for college? You might just tuck a bit of the rent he is giving you in an account to hand him back when he either heads to college or gets his own place.", "You're the biggest asshole. This kid, yes KID, lost his home and his sense of safety...and you're gonna take 10% of his earnings. Nah. You and his mom need to come to an agreement on payment...like child support. Don't take it out on the victim. Go give that kid his money back. Or save what you're taking from him to give back when he's ready to move out.", "YTA because you should be charging his mother rent, not him. She is obligated to house him in a safe place and if she can't provide that then she needs to pay you to support him. So yes, you deserve payment but not from a minor.", "So your nephew was homeless for a few months and his mom didn\u2019t care? And neither did you? You need to talk some sense into your sister and start giving a shit about this child! No he shouldn\u2019t have to pay you for a place to live (he is a CHILD!). If you really need the money and mom isn\u2019t willing to leave the abusive stepdad, then make them pay for him to stay w you.

This minor child left his house because the environment isn\u2019t safe for you and answer is charge him rent? God I hope this kid realizes how awful you all are and can a good life for himself without you", "YTA - If you aren't saving atleast half of that money for him later. \nCover what is an extra expense from that money and save the rest for his future.", "YTA, as is his mother. He is 16 years old. He should be safely living at home and going to school. You are charging a minor child to get out of a bad situation. That sucks. His mother also sucks for prioritizing a man over her child and allowing you to charge him for her mistakes.", "If his mom has such a problem she can pay you child support payments.", "This is a tough question.  In all reality, his mother should be paying you, especially if she's receiving money from nephew's father.  \n\nTo be honest, I think you would be better off opening up a bank account and have nephew pay 10% (and any extra savings he would like to put in) each pay day into that account for when he \"grows up\".  Put it towards a home later on or a car after he finishes school / uni.  And the idea being he doesn't touch that money at all, let it grow.  Ask him if he would like to save for a house or a car and that account not be touched until that time.  If he decides to buy a car, then ask him if would like to continue the saving for a house after he buys the car.\n\nAt least that way, you aren't making money off him but he is learning to save in a safe environment.", "YTA he's a minor.", "To be honest, I don\u2019t have enough facts to really make an opinion, but I would put yourself in his shoes for a moment. What you want someone to do for you (at age 16)?\nIf he doesn\u2019t pay for a month, what will you do? Evict him? Think about the potential courses of action and choose appropriately. What are the long term consequences with his sense of safety, family, your relationship with other family members. \nIt may be fine to teach him that things cost money, but once you have money, it isn\u2019t wrong to use it to help others out.", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH on this one. I don\u2019t think you should be charging rent to a minor, that\u2019s quite interesting. Maybe ask him to help with the groceries or something like that because now it\u2019s two of you there but not rent. The stepdad sounds like biggest AH for making it unsafe for your nephew to live there and make it so he can\u2019t see his mom or siblings. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call OP the AH, I would just stop charging the nephew rent.", "YTA.\n\nI understand that you need help with his upkeep. This is reasonable, but it should be gotten from your sister.\n\nIf he feels so unsafe that he is okay with paying you rent at 16, then somebody needs to alert authorities to this situation. There are small children in that home, and there is apparently something unsafe about it.\n\nAt the least, you need to ask your nephew some pointed questions.", " NTA 10% is less than $15.00 a week, and this is going by the federal minimum wage 7.25 an hour. The kid has no other bills and can spend the rest of his money as he sees fit.", "Go back and reread your post. How can there be any question YTA?", "YTA no doubt.  His mom basically abandons him and then you make him living with you a business reaction.  SMH", "YTA here but a way to turn that around would be if you were taking the money he\u2019s paying you and putting it into savings for him.  He\u2019s working 20 hours a week while attending high school and dealing with a lot of emotional turmoil.  Be the man for him that his stepfather isn\u2019t so that he learns how to be a man himself.", "YTA", "YTA - help the kid get a head, not make it harder for him.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA but I have 1 question for you.  \n\nWhat are you doing with the 10% he\u2019s paying you. You are NTA if you are setting it aside in an account that he can access at 18 for his future. YTA if you are pocketing that money. \n\nThis is a 16 year old kid with a rough home life and just wants to be somewhere he feels safe. Charging him rent for that is wild, when you are in a position to provide that and have it take no extra toll on you. Instead of rent, how about just making him buy his own groceries or splitting the grocery bill?", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you should charge your nephew. I think you should get money from his mom and from your older sister\u2014 who clearly wants to help:) It costs A LOT to feed a 16 year old\u2026 and there\u2019s a lot of extra\u2014 electricity, laundry, water etc.", "YTA", "YTA. I can\u2019t even imagine taking money from a teen who has no other way out. Disgusting behavior.", "CPS needs to be involved if he feels more safe couch surfing than being at home.", "ESH except the child. His stepdad sucks for \u201chating\u201d a child and disrupting his home life, his mum sucks for choosing the stepdad over her own son, you suck for charging him rent. Really, mum should be paying you what you need to cover his food as he is still a minor, this is definitely not his responsibility and to say he has a place where he can get free food and rent so he\u2019s choosing this for himself is utter bollocks, you know that that is not a safe place for him to be, he doesn\u2019t actually have a choice and you know this! That reeks of some mental gymnastics to try to justify what I think you already know is shitty behaviour on your part.", "YTA! HE IS 16 AND YOU ARE HIS AUNT!!!!!!", "YTA\n\nLet him put away money for his future so he can move out and declare him as a dependent on your taxes.", "ESH except the kid.\n\nWhere is his mother and why isn't she providing him a safe living environment? If her partner is more important than her kid, she can at least pay you to help house her kid.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t be charging a 16 yo rent.", "YTA. Poor kid has nowhere safe to go", "So his options are to couch serf and not have a stable home, pay rent at 16 or live in an unsafe environment. That poor kid.", "Your nephew doesn\u2019t feel safe at home. So his options are shelter\u2026or couch surfing. You don\u2019t have to provide housing for him, but since he is still legally a child\u2026you might want to. Mildly TA", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not really rent is it? It sounds like he\u2019s basically paying a flat rate for you to feed him. \n\nSo, either charge him that, or let him live there for free but he has to buy all his own food, toiletries and utility usage. \n\nSounds to me like he\u2019s getting a great deal. And if he has no issue with it, then everyone else who are not him can butt the fuck out.", "Why so many Y T A? This isn\u2019t that much and it teaches financial responsibility. I agree to try and get the mother to pay\u2026 but I\u2019d say NTA. He\u2019s not your kid and you\u2019re being reasonable", "morally evil", "YTA. He's sixteen. He's uncomfortable at home, and he felt comfortable enough to stay with you. But instead of offering him a safe space, you're taking his money when you don't need to and probably making him feel like a burden. Why not have him contribute to chores or things that need to be done around the house instead?", "YTA. He\u2019s 16.", "YTA. Poor child.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t charge rent to minors. You charge their parents or not at all. This is a truly hideous situation and you\u2019re taking advantage of a child.", "YTA and so is his mom and stepdad \n\nThis poor kid is struggling and your taking money from a 16 year old? Charge the adults, not the child. \n\nHe needs someone on his side, be that person", "NTA\n\nSounds like your older sister likes to complain when she doesn't have skin in the game. \n\nA simple response is that the expense for nephew is X dollars per month, so is she willing to send that much? Split it with you?\n\n10% of paycheck really isn't all that much and it probably helps him feel better about his decision, because like you said, he has a room at home that he can use for free. He's old enough to understand that while he has a right to food and shelter, you are not the person obligated to provide it. \n\nIf you really feel bad about taking his money, just keep it in a savings account and give it to him as a gift when he leaves for college, or whatever. \n\nEnjoy this time with your nephew!", "I\u2019m a mom, 10% is fair. He\u2019ll feel more independent and less of a burden and will have less of an incentive to spend frivolously. Those are all good life experiences for a guy with a paycheck that in reality wouldn\u2019t cover rent on his own. And he\u2019ll be getting that, food, utilities. And peace.", "The only way you\u2019d not be the AH would be if you save every cent he gives to you so that when he moves out, he has a pot of gold. It\u2019s still an awful thing to do. I pity him as his family sucks.", "YTA. I\u2019d be asking his mother to help cover costs and not take the child\u2019s money, sure if mom can only cover the basics he can pay for other things like his cell phone but not rent.", "YTA. You're taking advantage of a vulnerable kid in a bad situation and profiting. Do you care about your nephew at all beyond his paycheck?", "I'm going to go with a borderline NTA. Personally I would not consider charging rent in that situation, but I do understand that you are incurring some cost by housing him (increase in utilities, food, etc). With that being said, you are helping him escape a likely toxic household so you should be commended for that! If you are having some doubts on the morality of the situation, I suggest putting a portion of his \"rent\" in a savings account to set aside for him as downpayment (security deposit/first month/last month and all that jazz) on his own place when he wants to leave.", "NAH- I think everyone is saying YTA based upon a 16 year old having to pay their own way, and of course that shouldn\u2019t be happening. But you also should not have to part with money to make this situation work when it is not your doing and you are trying to help. \n\nYou say costs have gone up since he moved in, understandably, and this puts more pressure on you and is probably now costing you savings etc. so it\u2019s affecting your quality of life or ability to get ahead. Covering this extra cost should fall on your sister (the boys mother). Your nephew is a minor and she is solely responsible for the cost of raising him/ his living expenses.", "NTA. 10% of nephew's paycheck for room and board is very reasonable, and probably makes him feel he is paying his own way, which is very empowering. If his aunt wants to pay his way, that's up to her and him. She wants to intrude, so why doesn't she go directly to nephew and sent him the money to pay you with, if it bothers her so much.", "NTA you're charging him like 80$ a month, people need to chill, just covering some of his groceries.", "NTA. He will appreciate the experience of budgeting. However. I might be putting some of it away for him if you can afford to, that is if you don\u2019t NEED the extra loot to pay the rent. If you can put enough away for him that he\u2019ll have the dough to bankroll his own spot in a couple years that would be clutch.", "NTA. If your sister is so upset then she could be sending you some money to cover for the extra expenses. \nIt\u2019s easy to have an opinion but at the end of the day no one else is stepping up to help your nephew.", "YTA and so is his Mother+Step Dad!\n\nI hope you're taking that \"rent\" and saving it for him so he has some money saved up when he leaves and goes no contact with those who took advantage of him while he was in such a shitty position as a CHILD... like you are.", "YTA - but if you want to do something nice, save all that money he\u2019s paying you and give it to him as a graduation gift.", "YTA But if you're having trouble affording your nephew's needs, I think you should ask your older sister to help contribute. She's clearly concerned about him too, and it shouldn't fall squarely on you to provide for him.", "I\u2019m going to be extremely blunt: Thank goodness you aren\u2019t my aunt.", "YTA and that\u2019s probably illegal anyway\u2026 poor kid", "YTA\nHe\u2019s a minor. A family member who needs help. You indicated this is not creating a financial hardship for you & you still choose to charge him?

In my state, 16 year olds can sign a rental agreement. You can access Government payments for income and rental support. If you end up in crisis accommodation or medium-term accommodation you actually have to pay for lodgings out of your government benefits, which amounts to 15-25% of income received. This is part of developing life skills. Not enough information in the OP around entitlements and other situational stuff to say Y T A.", "NTA\n\nBut his parents should be chipping in some money.\n\nI presume older sister is not volunteering to take nephew in.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced the nephew should be giving money but I understand the reasons why 16 yr olds will eat you out of home.", "nta.  Your nephew and his mom seem to be fine with itand it's really none of your other sister's business.  If it's that important she can move back to your town so he can live with her and be close to his mom.", "NTA.  The OPs logic is just fine.  The older sister needs to butt out unless she is willing to be part of the solution.", "NTA\n\nHe wants to live with you, he can pay something 10% is not much at all.\n\nHis mom should be paying you for his expenses however.\n\nNow, if he doesn't feel safe around stepdad? That really paints your sister in a bad light, letting him treat her son poorly.\n\nOr is it just a case they don't get along, and they just argue all the time? If that's the case having consequences for not wanting to live there is perfectly valid, doesn't matter if he is a minor or not.", "NTA. It's 10% of the money he makes. It's not a flat fee. I don't really get the many YTA replies here. If he can work, he can contribute a bit. 10% is a symbolic gesture more than it is a real help for the household. OPs cost went up and he has no obligation here  The other sister is complaining, but is she helping in any sort of way ? Maybe she can give the 10%. Can't the mother help with a bit of cash ? You seem to be the only one taking responsibility on the kid while everyone is just pointing fingers without actually helping out.", "NAH I don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019re the asshole but I also think if you can afford it.. don\u2019t let him pay. His mother is the AH here CANT believe she\u2019s letting her child go stay somewhere else and pay for it. He\u2019s 16 working 20hrs. Maybe you could help him save up a bit and when he\u2019s older (if he plans to stay for long) then start charging him. But you\u2019re not entirely wrong for charging him ofc you have your own money but doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to do this favour. Ultimately it\u2019s your choice there\u2019s nothing wrong with you charging him since it\u2019s 10%. Since you said that you can\u2019t afford it comfortably the charging would be the right decision for you.", "NTA   so is your older sister stepping up to take him in rent free?", "NTA first of all your sister should be the last person to complain - she should be paying you child support for letting her son live with you. Having said that - I've actually been in a similar position and I didn't charge the teen any rent, and I wish I would have. It would have helped them learn better financial management and I think they would have been more appreciative. Instead after 2 years I ended up with an 18 year old who was ungrateful, unappreciative, had zero financial management skills and is now couch hopping from friend's house to friend's house", "NTA. These same people calling you TA wouldn\u2019t take other people in who isn\u2019t there responsibility and take the burden for all the cost of food and extra utilities and stuff. Honestly 10% isn\u2019t much at all that\u2019s probably less than $200 a month. How about just make him buy all his own food and stuff for the house like toilet paper, paper towels milk and stuff. You will probably save more money by doing that and you don\u2019t have to say rent", "NTA. Bout to be an adult and 100% responsible for self. You're teaching a valuable lesson. 10% ain't shit. Have no other bills, so all the money is theirs to spend on whatever they see fit. Keep doing what you're doing. This kid needs you.", "NAH\n\nIt is great that you are willing to have yuor nephew live with you.\n\nI get where your older sister is coming from and it is also great that she cares about her nephew.\n\nYAs you say your nephew could live at home, he is choosing to live at your place. Frankly at even more than 10% of his income he is doign quite well out of the deal. Yes he is a kid but it is good experience for him to learn in a sfae environment how to pay his own way.", "NTA,  10% is reasonable,  if I understand right you are still paying a good part of what he needs (food, utilities  etc. ).\n\nHe agreed from the beginning and it is your sister she one with an issue there... as long as your nephew any you are on with the agreement I don't see the problem,  you are helping him and also showing him that his decision is moving out comes with responsibilities.  \n\nYou mention tat you can afford the rent but that you can not,  easily,  afford all the extras of having him live with you. \n\nWould you charge him rent if you could easily afford the whole?", "NTA. Just because other people would not do it, does not make you an asshole. Like for me, personally, I would never charge a family member rent to live with me, but I wouldn't deny if they offered either. But also, I don't think that someone IS an asshole for asking for a small portion. You still have bills to pay and it's not fair to you to pay his portion of his light and water usage. If you were asking for half his check, sure that might be mean. He's just a kid still.

My sister has 4 other kids with my nephew's stepdad. The oldest is 8 and the youngest is just a few months. My nephew and his stepdad both hate each other. \n\nMy nephew had been couch surfing with friends on and off for a few months before he moved in with me. My roommate moved out at the end of last year and I can afford the rent without him now so wasn't planning on having someone else move in. My nephew has a job and works around 20 hours a week. When I offered him a place to stay it was on the condition that he pays me 10% of weekly paycheck. His mom knows I am taking part of his earnings as rent and has no problem with it.\n\nHowever, my older sister (not his mom) found out I was charging him rent to live with me and thinks I'm an asshole. She says because he is still 16 nobody should be charging him rent. I disagree as he has a bedroom he can sleep in free of charge and where he can get all his food free of charge. He is choosing not to live there. He is choosing to live with me even though he knew upfront he would have to pay rent. I don't have any kind of custody and am not his legal guardian, his mom still is. My sister argues because I can afford to house him/feed him etc that means I'm charging him for no reason (I can afford it but not comfortably as my grocery bill has doubled and electric has gone up), and he should be saving or spending that money on himself. She also thinks he's not really choosing to live with me but rather choosing to live somewhere he feels safe (which is not with his stepdad) and that I'm making him pay for something he has a right to. This point makes me question myself as I somewhat agree. I know he would rather be living with his mom because they are very close but living with his stepdad has become too hard for him. He would probably live anywhere else right now. I am also the only relative that lives in the same town as his mom, so even if my older sister would happily let him live with her, she lives to far away. I'm his only alternative option that isn't his friends\u2019 houses. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you can't comfortably afford to have your nephew live with you, you should speak to his mother about getting rent or other help from her (i.e. could she buy you groceries to offset your increased grocery bill, since her grocery bill has gone down)? \n\nYou should also see if your local government has programs to help people who take in minors and give them a safe place to live. Where I live (in Canada), you don't get money from Children's Aid for taking in a relative (i.e. it's not like having a foster kid), but you get a tax return for being a caregiver for a minor etc.", "YTA\n\nI do have to say that charging a 16 year old family member isn't right. Now, if he was 18 or older I'd say by all means charge him since he's an adult. However, I do understand having expenses increase. Another mouth to feed, another person using water and electricity. I would instead ask his mom if she would provide you that 10% charge. So working 20 hours a week he can't be making that much, asking his mom, your sister, for $250 a month isn't bad or extreme. That covers food for him and increased expenses. Have you thought about that?", "YTA just imagine how bad something must be for a 16yo that they'd rather pay rent than live somewhere for free. Most kids who hate it at home save up until 18 and then leave but your nephew chose not to wait cuz it's better than staying with his step dad.\n\nI'm also not really surprised his mom doesn't care about the rent as she has married someone her son hates enough to basically run away from home. I'm not saying that the mom isn't allowed to date or anything but while you have kids the least you can is finding someone who is gonna be at least neutral with the kid (different if nephew was 18 or older ofc but even then it'd be nice if they wouldn't hate each other)\n\nI'm also curious why your nephew hates the stepdad", "Dude.

This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed. This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read this before contacting the mod team\n\nMy eldest son is 16 and a junior in HS. A few months ago, he started dating a 14 yo freshman. I was a little uncomfortable with the relationship as soon as he told me about it. As an adult 2 years is not a concerning age gap, but during teen years I feel as though there is a large amount of difference between these two ages.\n\nI was also concerned as I know that my son was sexually active with his last girlfriend (who was the same age as him). At 14 this should not yet be part of young girls\u2019 relationship (and it hasn't been so far). As they've spent time at my home, I have also noticed a significant maturity gap between the two of them. As well as this, my son told me that he hadn't met her parents because she is not allowed to date, she's been lying to them and saying she's been at a different friend\u2019s house.\n\nI have my own personal issues with this relationship. When I was 14, I became pregnant with my son, whose father was 17 at the time. As I've grown up, I have come to see the relationship I had with his dad in a different light and feel as though he took advantage of me. Because of my naivety his was able to abuse and control me because I had no past experience to rely on. I've seen first-hand that my son's relationship does not have any of these other issues, but it does make me concerned about the dynamic of their relationship.\n\nOn Friday I sat down with my son to talk to him about his relationship. I suggested to him he should maybe end things with this girl and pursue instead a girl in his grade. I explained to him some of the points I outlined here and told him for the first time how I retroactively felt about my relationship with his father. He was unhappy that I would even have this discussion with him and told me I was interfering and overreacting. He also called me a hypocrite as my husband is 9 years older than me, and then would not listen when I explained appropriate age gaps in relationships grow as you get older.\n\nHe ended up leaving that night to stay at his dad\u2019s house for the weekend. I then got an angry call from my ex who thinks I'm an asshole for trying to meddle in our son's relationship and telling him about how I had felt about our relationship. My husband also somewhat agrees that I'm overreacting and that 14 yo and 16 yo is a fine age range to date in.\n\nI honestly don't know if I'm being the asshole here and letting my feelings get in the way of being a supportive mom. But I can't stop the feeling that as a woman it's not just my duty to look out for my son but also a young girl that might end up making choices she regrets. I'm also used to being the \"fun mom\" and my son usually tells me a lot about his life, I'm worried now that I've overstepped in his eyes that that might change.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It doesn't seem like they're charging rent to pocket that money as extra income.

He should not be paying a single penny for \u201crent food utilities and peace\u201d. As you\u2019re a mother, I hope to god you\u2019re not charging your children for basic necessities.", "OP mentioned paying for kids food quite abit. 15 bucks aweek for food and place to stay is very little and makes OP slightly less hurt from the increased power and food costs. OP could be saving that money but instead is helping his nephew when his parents are being shit heads. I understand he is a minor but not everyone can afford to have a rent free roommate without hurting them long term.", "> 10% of paycheck really isn't all that much \n\nThat's what I was thinking. It's not a fixed dollar amount. So if the kid doesn't work as much he doesn't pay that much either. If he's working at minimum wage that is less than $14 a week assuming $7.25/hr for 20 hours. After taxes, maybe only $10 a week. So the kid gets a safe roof over his head for only $40-$50 a month. That sounds like a good deal to me.", "Reddit has some wild hive mind mentality sometimes. As someone who moved out young and has supported himself (clothes, transportation, food, medical needs) since around 14 I can say that nephew likely feels better knowing he\u2019s contributing.\n\nIn many cases, when the person actually has a sense of morality, there is nothing worse to someone who\u2019s couch surfing or bouncing around than feeling like you\u2019re not somehow supporting your costs. \n\nMaybe Mom and Step-Dad are AH\u2019s, but OP is NTA here. Sounds to me like she\u2019s the only one interested in not only caring for the child but also ensuring the child learns responsibility and a practical reality of life.", "I love the idea of putting that 10 percent away into savings. He could receive the money when he turns 18 and is met with more than likely even more financial burden. This could also prepare him for budgeting money which is an inevitable necessity around the corner. \n\nI do feel for the kid. I feel like the 10 percent should be structured in a way that benefits him. I think he likely feels pushed aside by his family already. \n\nNTA.", "I agree with this 100%. 10% of a 20 hr week is very minuscule. This will teach him responsibilities and spending habits.  He won\u2019t grow up all entitled. NTA.", "The percentage thing makes it significantly better for me. This is different than charging a kid $500 rent and putting him in a position where he feels like he might be homeless any second. It would make me feel a lot worse about it if there was any chance the kid was worried about not having enough to make rent.\n\nIt seems like this arrangement is working. Obviously, his mother should be contributing, but who knows if that can happen. I think it\u2019s not ideal to charge a kid rent if he doesn\u2019t feel safe at home, but I also think it\u2019s a reasonable amount based on a set percentage, and covers some of the costs to OP of having a bigger household.\n\nTo me, the biggest deciding factor in whether this is appropriate is how the kid feels. If he feels like he\u2019s not wanted anywhere (because he\u2019s being charged rent by family and is apparently unwelcome in his own house in some way), and is exhausted from working so much but feels pressure to pay OP, then obviously that\u2019s not good and they have to work out something else.\n\nBut it\u2019s possible that he may feel good about it. When I was 16, I would 100% have felt like somewhat of a burden staying with a non-immediate family member for an extended period of time. My family is very gracious, but I would have wanted to help. 10% of my earnings going toward rent would be a welcome way that I could feel like I am contributing. And it\u2019s possible the teenager here feels a sense of responsibility, as well as contributing to a household in a productive and helpful way. This would be quite a change from living with a stepfather who hates you and vice versa, and contributing mostly negativity and argument (or whatever it is) to that household.\n\nIf what he feels about the arrangement is mostly a sense of pride and a knowledge that he\u2019s in a safe place, I think it\u2019s functional and should continue. If he mostly feels unwanted and stressed due to his new arrangement, things should change.", "I think most people think the boys parents should pay for his stay and not the boy, I can agree with that.

Also, the people in power have no interest in making the country or the world a better place. Instead, they line their pockets so they can live ultra comfortably for the last decade of their lives. Also, yes, people will absolutely take advantage of their children.

Wtf kind of drugs are you on?", "great idea!", ">\"Then don't help him out at all\". \n\nThis is everything you need to know about this persons response. \n\nClassic Reddit.", "If he had a car, he'd probably be sleeping in it instead of couch surfing at friends. Should OP get a second job to be able to comfortably afford their nephew to stay with them?", "So much this!! The kids mother is the one responsible for the rent.", "I want to say for the nephew, he is eligible to get help for food at local food pantries. That way he could contribute but not have to pay money. It could help the uncle feel more charitable towards his nephew because he would have lower additional costs to let nephew live with him.", "But the older sister could also help with the cost instead of just judging op.", "I agree, and also feel like the older sister and other family members can put they're pennies where their mouth is. \n10% of take home pay is very little, like a reverse allowance, and feels more like a symbolic lesson then a real money maker for OP. it's a nuanced and difficult situation for sure.", "It's terrible and cruel and impossible even when it's adults.", "This right here. It\u2019s symbolic and I don\u2019t really see anything wrong with it. I\u2019m fortunate in that I wasn\u2019t on my own at 16, but if I had been, my pride would have forced me to contribute something to household expenses. I don\u2019t have pride anymore but I did then :P", "They will if OP files for child support.", "Make the step-dad pay.", "Thats not entirely accurate. In England and Wales consent applies if they are still under the same roof as parents. If they move out at 16 by their own choice, then they've made themselves a legal adult (also classed as an adult if they've become a parent at that age), if parents have kicked them out then child laws would apply and social services can become involved although not always. (I did it myself and looked further into it when my daughter was thinking about it)\nAlso child laws can't always apply. You're given NI at 16 and are legally able work, otherwise it would be child labour (although they can't work past midnight) and housing contracts are allowed to be entered into with references and/or a guarantor (doesn't have to be a parent). \nWhich is what the nephew seems to be doing, so both aunty's and nephew aren't seemingly doing anything illegal", "That's technically not correct - Wales has its own laws, but not its own legal jurisdiction. This is a problem the Senedd and its governments have asked the UK government to correct but they don't want to."]}
