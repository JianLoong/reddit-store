Giving gifts or money at a wedding is pretty routine.  Certainly you can communicate to the guests that it won\u2019t be necessary or discouraged, but you should let that be their choice.

In either case, all gifts should be gratefully accepted.", "NAH. I think a simple \"gifts are welcome but not required or expected\" added to the invites could solve this.

May I suggest an alternative (which is what I did once for a gift-giving occasion) knowing that people were already spending money on travel etc. I just asked that if attendees WANTED to give a gift, that they give a copy of their favorite book or CD. Most people included notes on why the book or songs were important or special to them, and some burned CDs of their favorite songs. Made everything so much more meaningful, and pretty much every gift was $30 or less. No pressure on anyone to overspend, and I got to learn so much about my friends and family.

That was a lot of fun.", "What a great idea.", "It's interesting that you mentioned donations to a house.\n\nI have some Somalian and Bangladeshi friends, and apparently, in their cultures, it is common for friend and family to contribute towards the purchase of household goods and furnishings and a deposit for a house.\n\nTraditionally, it was common that once they married, they would move out and into their own home, which would need to be fully furnished", "Just say there will be a donation box at the venue, give only what you can mis. \nThis way you can keep it anonymous, you drive the point home of you not wanting them to spen more than they can afford. \nPut the donation box behind a curtain/shelterd place. \n\nIm my culture we do this with funerals. So the family of the widow will say something like \"we thank you all for being here and supporting (Widow) in this time, for those of you able to make a small donation to the proceding there is a donation box in X area. We thank you all etc. Etc\"", "Yes, this is the way. Most people would give something anyway, but this would relieve pressure from them", "That's what I was thinking.  Donation to your favorite charity.", ">or say that the website is for \"my parent's friends\" and all you want from your friends is a good celebration\n\nThat could be dangerous to say. \nAs it can sound like OP and fiance is saying the friends are poor and don't worry, the rich friends will take care of giving them a honey moon. And might not take it as a well-intended thing.\nA sore spot often when you live paycheck to paycheck and might want to gift like others. \n\n\nLike others said, a wishing well or a donation site for the honeymoon where contributions are anonymous. Might just be the better idea. \nNo one will know who gave 4$ or who gave 300$ \nOr a closed off box. So no one can even see how much is put it.", "Right, but people expect and usually want to give gifts for weddings and babies. It's actually expected in most cultures. Honestly it's sometimes better to have a registry to just give people who are going to buy you something regardless a road map (some people are really against giving cash/honeymoon funds). \n\nAnd the literal intent of a baby shower is to \"shower you in gifts and love.\" Babies are expensive, and a lot of those expences show up all at once. Showers are meant to ease the financial burden and stress of the soon to be parents. And people are (understandably) picky about what they want for their kid, and their are so many options. A registry is a *kindness* in this situation. \n\nDon't be so focused on being independent that you don't let people love you.", "My family do love me and my family. We buy everyone gifts on birthdays and Christmas etc When we chose to have a baby that meant we understood our finances and were well equipped to pay for everything with bub. I don\u2019t find a child expensive at all tbh and have always provided for him. So no burden or stress for us at all. Having an enjoyable time with great food and drinks is enough!"]}
