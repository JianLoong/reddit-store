The truth is none of this is my business really and I could have never said anything and maybe that's what I should have done. While I know the truth it's possible that it doesn't matter since I am not involved. Maybe I see things being worse than they are or maybe my sister has some kind of plan for it.

It\u2019s lovely that you\u2019re looking out for Kevin\u2019s feelings, but ultimately, it\u2019s her family. \n\nI don\u2019t envy you for having to witness this as an outsider. Poor Kevin.", "NTA. Your sister is setting her husband up for failure and hurt. That's sad as he seems like a genuinely good person, but ultimately, you've said your piece to her. Now, whatever happens is on her.", "As other commenter said, NTA. But don\u2019t keep pushing it. If she wants him to find out the hard way, so be it. That will be her bad choice, not yours.", "NTA,I feel really sorry him", "NTA but I personally would tell him. If I was in that situation, I would be really hurt to know everybody except me knew that I was wasting my time. But I guess nobody give a fuck about a man's feeling as long as their kids are being taken care of. He was better off adopting", "NTA.\n\nFrankly, it sounds like your sister latched onto Kevin as an ATM, security provider, and babysitter.  Does she actually love him as a life partner, or just as a provider until her youngest leaves the nest?", "NTA\n\nI'm just wondering, does Kevin have family and are they aware of these expectations of his? I feel bad for your nephew and nieces if his family turns on them because of this and they end up dodging comments about being heartless (it seems like something that could happen if their son/brother ends up crushed due to this). Ultimately, they don't owe him any of this stuff but it's neither his nor their fault this has happened. Your sister has created a mess that the kids and Kevin will have to navigate the wreckage of one day. All while your sister will probably end up the least badly off due to it. Though it could, and probably should, cost her the marriage.", "NAH. Time will tell. It's not your place to expedite it.

It isn\u2019t your business.", "I'm going to get down voted here, but I don't care. \n\nFrom your comments, I can see that the kids don't know his end, that their mother has told them they don't have to see him as a father, but encouraging the opposite to Kevin.\n\nI think the kids are old enough for you to sit down with them and explain all of this. That this is how Kevin feels, and their mother is pushing and encouraging it.\n\nIf you don't have this conversation,  it is very likely that when things come to a head, they will blame Kevin, and he will be upset by them when *your sister* has been playing both sides for years.\n\nThe only AH here is your sister, and tge sooner this ends, the better it will be.", "NAH, your sister avoids telling, it must be hard to tell that her kids don't see Kevin as their father.

Just bring it to their attention that the kids might choose differently than what Kevin seems to expect. \n\nBy telling them that you know the kids will choose differently, you are implying that you know their kids better than them. And even if that's true (it definitely sounds like you're better at listening to the kids than what your sister is), you can still hit a nerve.", "NTA. I know you mean well and you're concerned about your BIL but unfortunately it's out of your hands. You need to back off and let the chips fall where they may. Even if that means your BIL will be hurt.", "NAH, but I do agree with your sister that this isn\u2019t your business. Expressing your concerns one time isn\u2019t a big deal, but I\u2019d drop the issue and not bring it up again. This is something they have to work out among themselves.", " I\u2019m just kinda hoping these three choose co-habitation over marriage. That would be a bullet dodged.", "Do people really sit there obsessing over a wedding and the details of this imaginary wedding for a bunch of near teens that aren\u2019t even engaged? I find this so odd. NTA", "Yeah, I won't push more. I do feel bad for him. I know he is going to be crushed in the future and it's a shame because the kids are not aware of what their mom has been saying to him but I also know she's been telling them nobody expects them to see Kevin as their dad and how he knows that they feel the way they do. When the day comes that he finds out I won't feel sorry for my sister at all, but him, damn.", "Yes, he has been a very good person and he's been set up for years to have his heart broken. But I won't do anything more. This is all up to my sister now.", "So do I.", "Yes, he does have family and I think they have the same expectations he does, though maybe not on the same level.", "It's not about him. They like Kevin and care about him but none of them saw him as their dad. They respect him and I think there are times they have felt he was there for them more than my sister. But for them he is not dad either.", "Okay, yes, I accept that.", "The kids are old enough to know what their mom has been telling Kevin.", "It might be time to tell all sides everything", "I wonder if dude is sacrificing so that these kids can go to college and get started in life, like a dad would, and they don't see him as a dad.\n\nWhat do the kids get out of not clearly expressing their feelings to him?", "Ugh, yeah, that was what I feared. Hopefully it doesn't lead to any negative backlash for your nephew and nieces. But my god what your sister is doing is leading to so many potential problems. And even if her husband stays with her after this, will any of her relationships ever truly recover. I feel bad for them all except for her.", "But it is about him..... he clearly feels like their dad and has been a father figure for so long. Is he clueless to how they feel? Or is it the fact that your sister is feeding him lies about how they feel towards him? Poor Kevin. What is wrong with your sister?", "Yeah, like if we remove the child/fatherhood aspect of it, this is a parent lying to their spouse about their adult children\u2019s opinion of him! It\u2019s wrong and IMO the best thing is to let the children know that the mom has been lying about them.", "I hope so too but I know you're right about this.", "It's the lies he has been fed by my sister all these years. He truly does not know that they don't feel like he's a dad to them. He thinks, because of what my sister has told them, that they feel that way but will take time to ever call him dad. Like when they're grown and have more life experience. I have no idea what is wrong with my sister.", "Kevin can't be that clueless and unaware surely???\nOh it's such a mess.", "The kids get along well enough with him that I can see why it would be believable to him. The kids and him have a pretty good dynamic outside of the lies that have led to expectations that will never be met. They just have no idea how much differently the other views it.", "Except obviously your sister. Why would she knowingly set up the man she loves for such heart break.", "Yes, my sister is very much aware but the kids and Kevin are in the dark. I don't honestly know why. Part of me wonders if she said those things so he would marry her. I'm not sure exactly how long ago she started letting him think these things but if she was doing it before they got engaged, maybe she wanted to get married sooner than he did. Or maybe she just doesn't stop to think about the feelings of those involved long term. I'm really not sure.", "Whatever her reasons they obviously can't be out of care for others.\nShe deserves to have this whole situation blow up in her face and expose her for the selfish person she is. But nobody else deserves the pain and upset it will ultimately cause.\nIt's an impossible situation and I feel for you. Fuck your sister and just be there for everyone else when it dies implode", "Yes, I expect there will be a lot of hurt once everything comes out. I will do my best to be there for them as much as humanly possible.", "Nta.\n\nYour sister is being rude tbh because she\u2019d rather avoid confrontation now than prevent Kevin from getting hurt down the line", "NTA. I feel sorry for her husband, he is going to crushed when the time comes.", "NTA - but tell the kids what mom has been telling Kevin", "NTA, but you will be if you don't tell Kevin.\n\nHe deserves to be able to find the family he wants with people who will reciprocate those feelings, and he is the only one who will get hurt here- the kids, despite knowing him and liking him for this long, still don't feel as if he's their father figure, and his entire desire in life is to fulfill that role, and it sounds like he's done a great job at trying to. The kids aren't the ones at stake here, and he deserves to be able to re-examine his relationship with them honestly, as hard as it will be on the dynamic between everyone else.\n\nHe only gets one life, and your sister is content in letting him waste it on people she knows don't feel the same. If you remain silent, you're just as complicit as she is in her lying. Not to mention the children are clearly already starting to be uncomfortable with these expectations. Those feelings will only fester if this is left unresolved, and they just may be expressed later anyway with a much harsher delivery.", "I agree with you, I would also tell him. Or at least ask the kids if they would be open to having a conversation with him about where he honestly stands in their lives. His feelings matter too", "Non-adoptees should not be placing adoption as some sort of cure for sterile people.", "Idk if I'd maybe tell the kids? So they don't get mad at HIM to dare assume he would have that role? So they know to try to be kind because their mother has lead him to believe it? What a terrible situation.", "Okay how about you enlighten me or what adoption is if not for people who cannot conceive.", "Yes, OP should 100% tell the kids. Or at least the oldest, and let them decide how to discuss it with their siblings if that's what they want to do. Maybe they won't care, maybe they will and they can know to make things clear before everyone gets blindsided one day. Sounds like they at least like Kevin, even if he isn't a father figure to in their eyes", "Presumably they don\u2019t want to hurt his feelings by outright saying to his face something they assume he already knows (per OP, mom has been lying to the kids about stepdad\u2019s expectations just as she\u2019s been lying to stepdad about the kid\u2019s feelings). OP said that they don\u2019t consider him a father figure, not that they dislike him.", "Yeah, that was probably overly harsh of me, this just seems like such an ugly thing for the sister to be doing."]}
