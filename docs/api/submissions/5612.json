{"id": 5612, "submission_id": "zuyc4p", "title": "AITA for not inviting my friend to my friend group's Christmas Eve plans?", "selftext": "I made a group of 6 friends (all female) from middle school and we've remained in touch during college. My friend Ella isn't friends with the 6 but we all attended the same high school so we do have some mutual friends. I've tried inviting her to plans in the past but she would say \"why would I want to hang out with them?\" Later on she told me that she didn't like my friends and asked me to stop inviting her because it's rude. I apologized and said I would stop. Not everyone can get along.\n\nI wasn't aware that Ella didn't like my friends when I invited her. She never had a fight or conflict with them. I think my friends were very nice to her also. They would try to include Ella because they wanted to get to know her. So I was confused. Writing this now, I recall Ella saying women are too much drama and how she was proud to be friends with only men but I thought she would grow out of that. I think many of us all say stupid things in high school that we regret.\n\nSo my group of friends planned a get-together for Christmas Eve. I didn't invite Ella because I knew she would refuse so I thought it would be rude. This isn't the first time she wasn't invited so I didn't think anything would be different anyways. Ella and I had plans for New Years Eve so we will be celebrating the holidays also.\n\nOn Friday, Ella asked what I was doing for Christmas Eve and I told her I was planning on hanging out with my other friends for the day. Ella was livid that I didn't invite her to the get-together. I wasn't sure how to make things right and didn't know she wanted to attend. I asked Ella if she wanted to come to the get-together but she refused and told me that I didn't get it.\n\nShe told me I was excluding her on purpose like always. She said she didn't like my friends because they go to prestigious colleges and have high GPAs. She said I was taking their side (I'm not sure what this means) by being friends with them and I'm just like them. She said it was my fault for making her feel jealous because I'm \"prettier and better\" than her at everything so people like me more, and continued on saying similar things.\n\nI told Ella that I wasn't excluding her because she said she didn't want me to invite her in the past. Ella kept blaming me for everything so I asked what I could do to fix things but Ella said the fact that I don't know makes me a bigger asshole.\n\nI think Ella is overreacting but one of our mutual friends messaged me to tell me I should be more considerate of Ella and I was a bad friend for excluding her. Now I'm not so sure.

You tried including her in the past, and she flat out told you to stop inviting her to hang with the other girls. You complied. \n\nYou\u2019re not a mind reader for knowing when you\u2019re supposed to disregard her original ask and invite her anyway. \n\nI\u2019m honestly confused on how you were supposed to react with Ella anyway.", "Ella has inferiority issues and is ridiculous for being mad about you not inviting her. She doesn't like your friends and told you to stop inviting her. Christmas Eve doesn't change that. It's messy but it sounds like this is going to end your friendship with Ella. If she can't get over her jealousy and inferiority, it's going to be hard to maintain your friendship. It sounds like she expects you to give up your other 6 friends for her, and that's absurd.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You're doing your best to be considerate of her, but her reactions are speaking of insecurity and a lack of respect. I would try and word out a calm and understanding message to her about how you care about her, and want to be a good friend, but you can't fix things that are a problem if she doesn't tell you about the problem. idk how old yall are, but I'd suggest asking her about what she's feeling, and how you can both make a mature and informed decision about how to move forwards with your friendship. \n\nI'd also remind her again that she's asked in the past to not be included in the gatherings with those specific friends, but that you've still been making an effort to spend time with her because you care about her. \n\nAs with any relationship, communication is key. Remind her that you're willing to listen, and if you don't understand something, you're willing to learn. And if she's not willing to meet you half way... well, perhaps it's a good idea to give that friendship some space.", "NTA\n\nIt's the maleficent effect.\n\nIt's not that she wants to go and be around people she doesn't like. It's that she wants to be invited and thought of. But she is doing so in an AH way.\n\nShe told you not to invite her and you did so.", "NTA but you need to drop Ella like a hot potato. That chick has more issues than playboy. not to mention the giant I'm a victim card she's waving around. Why the hell would you want to spend time with someone that toxic?", "NTA this girl is not your friend. It\u2019s time to move on and not look back or feel guilty. She\u2019ll never be happy, it\u2019ll always be your fault and she will do whatever necessary to ruin whatever friendship/relationships you have until your unhappy or a hollowed out shell. Only your destruction and her assimilating or taking over your life will make her temporarily happy then she\u2019ll move on to the next. She\u2019s the type that turn everyone against you and manipulate your man to sleep with her. Go watch single white female", "NTA\n\nSounds like maybe something happened between Ella and the other friend(s) that you\u2019re not aware of. That\u2019s the only way I could make sense of you \u201ctaking sides\u201d. But if she has a specific problem outside of them being more successful it\u2019s on her to communicate that with you. If her issues really just are the things mentioned above then she sounds just incredibly toxic and you should probably reconsider this friendship with her.", "NTA.\n\nMy childhood-high school best friend was like this. She wanted me all to herself and didn\u2019t want to share me; got weird and jealous when I made other friends. Ultimately our friendship ended because of some other BS on her end but it was easier to walk away knowing she had *always* been this way. \n\nWhat Ella really wants is for you to cancel with all of them and spend time with just her for Christmas Eve. And I say this as someone who sacrificed a lot of Christmas Eves over the years to someone just like her: never do it. Don\u2019t give in.\n\nThe consequences of Ella\u2019s direct request and actions are coming home to roost. She cannot have her cake and eat it too, so she\u2019s mad. \n\nIf someone messages you saying you should be more considerate I\u2019d be honest back - \u201cI am doing *exactly* what Ella asked me to do. She said not to invite her. Now she\u2019s mad because I listened to her. She can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d \n\nThis is some advice I got a long time ago that I want to pass on: all relationships have a lifespan.  Sometimes we are lucky and they\u2019re longer than ours. But most of the time they are not. It doesn\u2019t make the people involved into bad people - it\u2019s just the natural order of things. The drama often comes when people cannot accept it and move on.  \n\nAnd I feel like perhaps Ella thinks/knows yours is dying, so she\u2019s getting a little erratic. She obviously has a lot of complicated feelings for you - you\u2019ve described some obvious admiration mixed with projection of her insecurities. She accused you of thinking you\u2019re better than her because she thinks of herself as less than. And by being your friend it \u2018proves\u2019 that you\u2019re the same. NONE of that is your issue to manage. \n\nYou should decide if you want to cultivate/keep this relationship going. But I would only do it if you can have an open frank talk about it. That of course you like and respect her, but she will never be your only female friend, and she needs to decide if she\u2019s okay with that. If she\u2019s not then it sounds like you both should walk away for your own good.", "NTA. Ella has set you up for failure and then blamed you. She has then taken the opportunity of that blame moment to then extend that blame to cover all of her own insecurities. \n\nShe is a person who feels lots of jealousy and resentment, but refuses to see that these problems are arising from inside of her; and then cannot take responsibility for her feelings or actions, *or the consequences of her own actions*. She will then blame whoever is nearest to her. It\u2019s illogical because it\u2019s all just reactions to her own feelings\u2026which are irrational.\n\nThis is not uncommon, but it is a very unhappy and and toxic kind of behaviour pattern. TBH you are better getting yourself a safe distance from it for good. Or at the very least understand that all of her feelings are generated by her, and they are her own problem. Don\u2019t get sucked in.", "NTA Ella is too much drama, start distancing yourself from her...you have outgrown her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
