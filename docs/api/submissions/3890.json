It's actually pretty shameful that no one ever taught your brothers how to take care of themselves.", "NTA, Speaking from a male point of view, if your brothers can't take care of themselves and do basic housework, then your parents have failed completely. That said I have mild OCD and I get anxious and stressed out when I see anything dirty or out of place so there are never dirty dishes in my home.", "NTA, ask them why they expect you to do it?", "NTA\n\nTake pictures like others suggest and tell them you\u2019ll show them to their future GF\u2019s just so they know what they\u2019re getting themselves into.", "NTA I would be mortified if my wife had to run around cleaning my mess.

What other chores ARE they doing?\n\nIt's very common for households to have an \"I do this, you do that\" arrangement. If they're taking all the trash out, even yours, or doing all the laundry, even yours, then you doing *only* your own dishes is a mismatch of agreement.\n\nBut I'm going to rule NTA because it's pretty common for guys to be in the wrong on this and your mom already agreed which also indicates that you aren't in the wrong.\n\nLet your brother do his petty squabbles. Either he's right or he's wrong in how much of his chores are for your benefit. When you move out, he won't be there, so you can even thank him for helping you practice living on your own in such a way. (How sarcastically is up to you.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
