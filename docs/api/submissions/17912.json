Yes, he was a crazy man. My dad inherited his house but never lived there, so when I had my first child in 2018 and got married in 2019, my dad made me an incredibly generous offer for the house. I bought computers that were more expensive than the house.\n\nThe bunker became kind of an urban legend, mostly because my old grandpa used to tell a lot of crazy stories, but out of curiosity I went looking for it and found the entrance. THE OLD MAN REALLY DID IT! \n\nSo, thanks to being stuck at home during the uneventful 2020 and 2021, I started remodeling the bunker to look less like a Fallout Vault and more like my own man cave. Everyone loves it, especially the kids (My nephews and friend's children). So the house is decorated to my wife's taste, while I can do whatever I want in the bunker, play gaming, fix computers, set up a whole home server, work from home, etc.\n\nHowever, lately she has been complaining about me being distant and spending a lot of time there and less time with her and our child. She is pregnant again, so she said she was worried, but I just promised to spend more time at the house. After a few weeks that wasn't enough for her and she accuses me of abandoning her.\n\nI'm asking for judgment here because I'm trying to be there for my family, but this bunker feels like it's the only thing that's really mine and where I can actually have a break, but my wife has said she's going to seal the entrance otherwise I might miss the birth and not even notice. Should I just move all my stuff into the house and forget about it? Am I really being neglectful, or is this just her pregnancy hormones talking?\n\nTo be clear, I do help with the house chores and spend time with my son when I'm there and I have an intercom in the bunker so my wife can just call me if she needs anything and I'll go up there immediately.\n\nETA: Everybody is asking me this. I spends at least 6 hours at the Bunker on week days. I work there so I think is reasonable, and at least 4 hours on weekends. But yeah, ur right, I need to make arrangements.\n\nI forgot to mention: Our son goes to kindergarten so my wife has time to work and sometimes be alone at home.\n\nETA 2: Guys, I swear I'm taking notes. I'm just trying to understand what I should change about myself and how to talk to my wife about this. Remember that I spend at least 6 hours WORKING, not scratching my belly. My manager allows me to log out early if I finished my work for the day but can't log out if I've been working for less than 6 hours.

In general, it's good for both spouses to get time to themselves while the other one handles their shared responsibilities. \n\nNot right now though, because your wife is pregnant. You can't take over being pregnant from her so she can have an evening off, which means you are not entitled to time off either.

It doesn\u2019t sound like your wife gets \u201coff\u201d time like you do, if she is in the house doing a hobby of hers your young child is still there with her and she still has to keep an eye on the child and if they are young usually entertain them the whole time, whereas if your in your bunker the child is not coming down there with you where you are actually watching them while doing your hobby. She also has to physically contact you via an intercom to come and do a chore or look after the child etc. I understand when you are working you need to focus on that but the amount of time you spend there, especially on weekends is much too long.

But you might want to talk to your wife about some expectations. You work from home in there and spend 6 hours minimum there? That's entirely reasonable. I've had to have conversations where if I am working from home it doesn't mean I'm on vacation and I'm just available all the time. To me, 2 hours of your work day is spent outside of your work place. The weekends however is gonna be up to y'all and coming to a common ground. I like people being around even when I'm doing my own thing separate from them, so it could be just the isolation or being removed from being nearby.

What \"healthy\" looks like depends on a reasonable discussion between the two of you. \n\nThat being said, from a pragmatic point of view, the optics aren't great for you. If she starts telling friends a similar version of this story, it's going to be very hard for you to come out looking like a good guy. \n\nThe desire for personal space in the early years of child rearing isn't really a thing. Like, does your wife have it? Where can she go to be alone? How can she initiate that if you are already bunkered down? You might consider some proactive offers for her to rest, perhaps even bringing the child\\[ren\\] to hang out with you so that she has the run of the home to do Homealone things. \n\nThis can probably all be solved with a good conversation, but I would urge you to be proactive about the optics.

Like always having dinner together, making a plan for the household chores & childcare responsibilities, trying to compare expectations, making a point to fit quality time in your schedule etc?\n\nRather than vaguely \"promise to spend more time at the house\" maybe make a concrete agreement so you can show you did your part & it isn't up to subjective arguments of how much is 'enough' time. \n\nI think there can probably still be a diplomatic solution here if you talk to each other & try to have an open ear for each other's needs (which must include your needs to have a private place to recharge, but also that you do your part with childcare & house chores)", "INFO\n\nYou very overstressed.

Schizophrenia is known to run in families. \n\nFrom what you've described you are:\n\nChoosing to spend a significant portion of your time in an isolated space created by your schizophrenic relative. A space created by them when they were experiencing a lot of painful and powerful symptoms in relation to that diagnosis. \n\nYou are spending upwards of several hours in that space at a time without leaving at all I presume based on what you've written here. So your family is right by you, and yet you're socially withdrawing into this space. This isn't a criticism on you wanting a space to yourself, everyone deserves that much, but what is concerning here is how long each stretch of time you spend down there is. We're not described a net total of 6 hours with you taking frequent breaks to go and catch some proper sunshine and check in on your family, what we're reading is that you go in there for 6 hours at a time. That is very concerning. \n\nAnother thing is that you're going through some serious stress right now: an expanding family with this second pregnancy. Assuming that you've been frequenting this bunker before your wife's second pregnancy, the issue has accumulated because you are either spending more time there net total or you're leaving the bunker less frequently while your wife is experiencing a particular stress in her life that calls for extra support and attention to her. **A serious level of stress can trigger an onset of schizophrenia when you may have demonstrated absolutely 0 signs of having a predisposition to this prior.** \n\nWhat you're describing can be the product of a short-sighted response to new levels of stress and life changes, **or** it can be the very early signs of an onset of schizophrenia. T**he earliest signs are: social withdrawal, blunted emotions, having difficulty speaking and looking at faces, isolating yourself, deterioration of hygiene, etc.** And in the likely case that you shrug this concern off with *\"nothing I'm doing is that out there, I just need to rearrange the way I'm doing things\"* I'm not going to try to convince you that you need help based on only the vaguest of signs. **BUT, if you EVER find yourself experiencing: a sudden sensitivity to light and sound, feeling unable to organize your thoughts or speech, finding yourself acting/responding in ways that you never would have before, or feeling a sense of powerful anxiety or dread without being able to identify a clear source to this sensation, SEEK HELP IMMEDIATELY.** \n\nAnd to end this dreadful response on a gentler note: **schizophrenia is manageable** nowadays with the treatment options available in comparison to what was around in your grandfather's time. There are **many** notable names in academia and the career fields out there who live with schizophrenia. When one relative has schizophrenia, the chances of any descending relatives having a predisposition goes up tremendously. **You and your wife really need to have some discussions between yourselves or with a professional who can answer your questions on what you should do if you ever notice the early signs in one of your children or yourself. This is a terrifying possibility to consider and respond to preemptively I know, but having a plan in case this scenario comes about will keep the path to treatment and a full life clear in comparison to simply assuming this could never come about.**", "Ypu can break up the work day by having lunch with your wife.  You can schedule time to watch a movie with your wife in the bunker so it's just an extention of the family room.

But that would be the case gaming or not, this has nothing to do with gaming and your comment made it clear you have no idea what you are talking about.", "By my count, if you are in a room by yourself, you are alone, but reasonable people can disagree", "He helps with chores in the house \"when he's there.\"\n\nThe buzzer thing is putting the labor on her to let him know he needs to do things even more pronouncedly than saying \"Well tell me what should be done and I'll do it.\" He's expecting his wife to take time from caring for their kid as well as her pregnant self to summon him to do things to help with their shared space and their shared kid.\n\nHe needs to be more present in the common space during the weekend so his wife ALSO can have some time for herself. He's complaining that the bunker is the only space that is his while her body, right now, is literally not even hers.", "Yes. I notice that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with the person I\u2019m replying to\u2026", "8 hours is pretty reasonable alone time during the weekend.\n\n* 16 hours awake per day\n   * 4 hours alone\n   * 8 hours with family\n   * 4 hours with kid while wife is alone", "I feel for you dragaonfruit, I get the same impression you do from this, seems like most of Reddit just wants to assume the very worst when we honestly don\u2019t have the finer details.  I want to know how much of his non working kid free time is spent in the bunker to make a real decision.  Other wise maybe he needs to move his work office into the house so they simply see him around more? I really don\u2019t have enough details.", "Did you read my other response?  I said he needed to cut down.", ">He helps with chores in the house \"when he's there.\"\n\nWhich is 18/24 hours in the day... seems pretty fair.", "I mean, you're misunderstanding a statement as a complaint. Dude's an asshole for the amount of time he spends there during the day, but you're creating another issue that doesn't exist.", "That's not the insult you think it is... If you hold your life to the standards of the average redditor, \"pathetic\" doesn't even come close to the right word. If you don't have an identity outside of reddit, then I hope you the best, but most people here are just sexist and hateful towards a man with a pregnant wife and hobbies. He's allowed both, so long as he's fulfilling the more important role first.\n\nYou'll understand someday, I'm sure. If you happen to have children and you realize you don't know who you are after they've left, or you find out that the opposite parent of those children doesn't see you as anything more than a father/mother. Sure, hobbies/interests don't define is, but they play a huge role in who we are.\n\nUntil then, I'm just going to assume you're well, an average redditor.", "Dude your argument here amounts to \u201ceveryone else feels that way so I do too\u201d, dragon made some well thought out points that are less aggressive towards the husband as opposed to the rest of Reddit.", "Oh my god, STOP MAKING EXCUSES. It doesn't matter what kind of game it is. Are you being deliberately obtuse? You're insufferable.", "Does your wife also regularly get hours of leisure time away from you and your child in a place that 'feels like it's hers'?", "Involve your kid. If you would bring the kid down and play games with him (or give him a game to play while you play yours (haven't you seen a parent give their young kid a remote that isn't on), I bet your wife would be thrilled to have several quiet hours on the weekend to herself. DON'T just go do it in the house so she can be mad while you sit on your games.  \n\n\nYou need to be having QUALITY family time as well. Maybe stay entirely with your family all day on Sunday and no time in the bunker.  \n\n\nI'm not touching how you guys split up household duties, but make sure you're doing your fair share WITHOUT having to be asked.  \n\n\nIf you did those two things, your wife would probably be bragging about you instead of nagging at you.", "Him \"helping\" is not fair. He shouldn't be helping, they should each have an equal share, with him doing more at this point because she is 24/7 pregnant. And that would mean that he would have the equal Responsibility for everything, and see what needs to be done. \"Helping\" and \"she can call me on the intercom when she needs me\" leaves this mental load to her.", "Pray tell, when does he give her 4 hours a weekend off? Until I get that answer, no isn't fair.", "Yeah, it's very easy to read someone's words and spin them to prove your point. However, I could easily read and comprehend OP's words to say the wife doesn't make him feel like he belongs in his own home.", "Why are you trying to make this about me?  Everything in this comment you\u2019ve just made  is completely irrelevant.  \n\nOP came here for some outside opinions on whether what he\u2019s doing is appropriate, and the consensus is that no, you don\u2019t get that much free time when you are a parent to small children.  They grow up so fast and eventually you do get back to having all the time for yourself, but when you have young kids it is not right to take all the free time for yourself and leave your spouse with no free time.", "He came here for opinions on whether his behavior is acceptable and the answer is no, it really isn\u2019t.  He\u2019s not going to benefit from people coddling him or making excuses for him.  He needs to take on half of the burden of raising these children that he helped make.", ">Him \"helping\" is not fair. He shouldn't be helping, they should each have an equal share\n\nWho said they're not both helping equally?\n\nHe has his own space while working from home, she has her own space while their child is not home during the day.  They come together at the end of their respective workdays and seemingly share things equally, she's just complaining he's not there with her during the day when their kid is at school and he's working.", "True, but I think he would've harped more on it if that were the case. He doesn't seem to be complaining that he doesn't have the whole house. \n\nI mean, it's not that rare of a phrase. I'm the same way. I admittedly don't have an eye, or a care, for fashion. So if my wife has an idea for the house, I'm not going to fight her on it. And I let her control what furniture we look at because, once again, she's much better at it. \n\nShe also said I can basically have, for the most part, freedom to decorate the TV room. I'd probably describe it as the lone room I have control over. It would not be a complaint lol.", "I get it, you're biased and you're allowed. You've been entering information that doesn't exist, just to confirm that. Wild that others on reddit of all places would also be sexist towards men... I understand this level of self reflection may be lost on you, but I wish you the best in life."]}
