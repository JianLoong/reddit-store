Yes, he was a crazy man. My dad inherited his house but never lived there, so when I had my first child in 2018 and got married in 2019, my dad made me an incredibly generous offer for the house. I bought computers that were more expensive than the house.\n\nThe bunker became kind of an urban legend, mostly because my old grandpa used to tell a lot of crazy stories, but out of curiosity I went looking for it and found the entrance. THE OLD MAN REALLY DID IT! \n\nSo, thanks to being stuck at home during the uneventful 2020 and 2021, I started remodeling the bunker to look less like a Fallout Vault and more like my own man cave. Everyone loves it, especially the kids (My nephews and friend's children). So the house is decorated to my wife's taste, while I can do whatever I want in the bunker, play gaming, fix computers, set up a whole home server, work from home, etc.\n\nHowever, lately she has been complaining about me being distant and spending a lot of time there and less time with her and our child. She is pregnant again, so she said she was worried, but I just promised to spend more time at the house. After a few weeks that wasn't enough for her and she accuses me of abandoning her.\n\nI'm asking for judgment here because I'm trying to be there for my family, but this bunker feels like it's the only thing that's really mine and where I can actually have a break, but my wife has said she's going to seal the entrance otherwise I might miss the birth and not even notice. Should I just move all my stuff into the house and forget about it? Am I really being neglectful, or is this just her pregnancy hormones talking?\n\nTo be clear, I do help with the house chores and spend time with my son when I'm there and I have an intercom in the bunker so my wife can just call me if she needs anything and I'll go up there immediately.\n\nETA: Everybody is asking me this. I spends at least 6 hours at the Bunker on week days. I work there so I think is reasonable, and at least 4 hours on weekends. But yeah, ur right, I need to make arrangements.\n\nI forgot to mention: Our son goes to kindergarten so my wife has time to work and sometimes be alone at home.\n\nETA 2: Guys, I swear I'm taking notes. I'm just trying to understand what I should change about myself and how to talk to my wife about this. Remember that I spend at least 6 hours WORKING, not scratching my belly. My manager allows me to log out early if I finished my work for the day but can't log out if I've been working for less than 6 hours.

In general, it's good for both spouses to get time to themselves while the other one handles their shared responsibilities. \n\nNot right now though, because your wife is pregnant. You can't take over being pregnant from her so she can have an evening off, which means you are not entitled to time off either.

It doesn\u2019t sound like your wife gets \u201coff\u201d time like you do, if she is in the house doing a hobby of hers your young child is still there with her and she still has to keep an eye on the child and if they are young usually entertain them the whole time, whereas if your in your bunker the child is not coming down there with you where you are actually watching them while doing your hobby. She also has to physically contact you via an intercom to come and do a chore or look after the child etc. I understand when you are working you need to focus on that but the amount of time you spend there, especially on weekends is much too long.

But you might want to talk to your wife about some expectations. You work from home in there and spend 6 hours minimum there? That's entirely reasonable. I've had to have conversations where if I am working from home it doesn't mean I'm on vacation and I'm just available all the time. To me, 2 hours of your work day is spent outside of your work place. The weekends however is gonna be up to y'all and coming to a common ground. I like people being around even when I'm doing my own thing separate from them, so it could be just the isolation or being removed from being nearby.

What \"healthy\" looks like depends on a reasonable discussion between the two of you. \n\nThat being said, from a pragmatic point of view, the optics aren't great for you. If she starts telling friends a similar version of this story, it's going to be very hard for you to come out looking like a good guy. \n\nThe desire for personal space in the early years of child rearing isn't really a thing. Like, does your wife have it? Where can she go to be alone? How can she initiate that if you are already bunkered down? You might consider some proactive offers for her to rest, perhaps even bringing the child\\[ren\\] to hang out with you so that she has the run of the home to do Homealone things. \n\nThis can probably all be solved with a good conversation, but I would urge you to be proactive about the optics.

Like always having dinner together, making a plan for the household chores & childcare responsibilities, trying to compare expectations, making a point to fit quality time in your schedule etc?\n\nRather than vaguely \"promise to spend more time at the house\" maybe make a concrete agreement so you can show you did your part & it isn't up to subjective arguments of how much is 'enough' time. \n\nI think there can probably still be a diplomatic solution here if you talk to each other & try to have an open ear for each other's needs (which must include your needs to have a private place to recharge, but also that you do your part with childcare & house chores)", "INFO\n\nYou very overstressed.

Working for 6 hours then go home- you\u2019ve stated he\u2019s in kindergarten so LUCKY HER has time to work? That\u2019s your justification for leaving her alone? YTA and genuinely try to understand why we\u2019re saying you are.", "Funny thing, that the reason why you can't do it at that level anymore is your neck and not like your wife, your child and your child to be. Noone is saying you have to stop gaming or seal your man cave, but you seriously have to tone it down timewise", "The WOW character from South Park was at least honest about his priorities", "Maybe I'm not understanding, clear this up for me; are you saying those 4-6 hours is not just gaming, but also doing your job?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause if it's just gaming, if you replace some of those keywords with alcohol, you'd be referred to AA. That's why I refer to it as an addiction. Your family is RIGHT there, RIGHT now. But you'd rather spend your time in a bunker underground talking to people miles from you that you may never meet (if those hours are just spent gaming). My grandpa also used to refer to his drinking as spending time with friends and networking, all while neglecting his family.", "There's nothing wrong with playing long stretches, but you just can't do it if you have a small child. I'm still unclear how much time you spend in the bunker when your kid is not in Kindergarten but that time should be very limited, definitely not happen every day, and match the time your wife gets for her own hobbies. Also, you are an adult, if you don't like being in your own home it's your responsibility to do something about it.", "Every response of yours OP are not only childish excuses, but also sooooo SELFISH. Almost everything you write is basically, \u201cMe me me\u201d or \u201cI want time to myself\u201d or \u201cI deserve it since I work and network\u201d. Do you not see how borderline pathetic it is that you\u2019re still defending yourself like this? You wanted a judgement, you got a pretty unanimous one - YTA. Be a better husband and father, because as it stands, you\u2019re an example of how NOT to be a quality partner/father/friend.", "It\u2019s because of the kid. Someone has to be (at very minimum) in the house with their child 100% of all hours of the day, so the extra non-working time that he\u2019s in the bunker (the 4 hours a day during weekend and 1-2 hours after he finishes work every day, as he stated) is extra time his wife has to parent solo, while pregnant and tired from her own job. He\u2019s both leaving her carrying the load of childcare and missing his son\u2019s waking hours. If she\u2019s saying he\u2019s going to miss the birth she\u2019s probably pretty far along. I couldn\u2019t be alone with my toddler when I was 8 months pregnant onwards, I was physically incapable of doing the labor of caring for her (lifting, carrying, bending, twisting). My mother had to move in with us to help me while my husband was at work. If he had chosen to spend extra hours away for recreation while the kid was awake, we would be Having Words.", "Oh, so *that's* where my dad gets his info!", "Your bedroom doesn\u2019t have a door? Thats a new twist on things", "Not really. I grew up in a pretty big house where both of my parents had offices but when my mom wanted the occasional alone time she\u2019d shut her bedroom door and curl up with a good book. \n\nIm sure they have a bedroom with a door\n\nLike I said before, him abandoning his fam (so his wife doesn\u2019t have the option to do that is the issue), not that he has his own space", "So you see the need for personal space so much so it\u2019s weighing your marriage? No sarcasm here, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\n\nI moved from essentially a 2 bedroom to a 4 bedroom house recently but before that the bedroom was mine and the office was my gf\u2019s. My computer, sim racing rig and music production gear was in the bedroom. I had my public domain NASA space tourism posters up and everything. She was in school so I had the compromised me-space but it was still my space to dictate. I personally cant buy the \u201ca room with a door cant be a personal space\u201d thing and i think were all against \u201cany personal space has to be 100% exclusive\u201d thing as well", "\u201cBut this bunker feels like the only thing that\u2019s really mine and where I can have an actual break\u2026\u201d\n\nI call it reading.", "He works from the bunker, the kid goes to school, she's at home during the time when the kid is at school and the OP is working.", "\"Why doesn't your wife also get a space for herself to disappear to\" is a question that contains an assumption.", "More or less, although his edit makes it clear he works from the bunker and is there for less than the normal workday on weekdays.", "I mean so she can have some alone/quiet time.", "And he's probably lowballing it. Most people do when they admit facts they know make them look bad.", "Me too", "And the adult response to that is to say \"I feel like every time I help you put me down\", and go from there. Not walk away from your family. Also, I have seen friend's husbands be so incredibly dense to what is needed and being so dense about how to do things, that yeah, it is reasonable to say that your spouse should be doing things correctly.", "My point here is that you\u2019re shutting your self off from your family, and that is going to lead to your wife and kids getting sick of you eventually if you don\u2019t stop. Why have a family if you don\u2019t want to spend time with them? You could\u2019ve just become a hermit instead of putting a woman through this and then bringing two kids into it.", "\"My hobbies are better than yours\" yeah, fuck that, all hobbies are worthless as time waster, but they all improve skills.\n\nGaming can improve critical thinking, strategy, reflexes.", "I'd like OP to clarify because I read that sentence as meaning he spends at least 4 hrs in his bunker per day on weekends, for a total of 8 hrs minimum every weekend", "IDK, maybe my family is family-ing wrong, but two hours to yourself on a weekend day, doing your own thing and not beholden to your family, is a *gift*. We make sure it happens, and it's good for everyone, but I can't imagine consistently getting that kind of time to myself every weekend (while keeping up with chores, prepping for the week, doing wholesome family stuff, etc.).", "So?  Does he make sure his wife gets an hour or two to play video games every day?", "I needed alone time as a new mother. It kept me sane.  But we're talking a bath and an hour with a book.\n\nI took care of my kids just fine.  But if you ignore your own needs you eventually can't meet anyone else's.\n\nIt's about balance.", "Okay but he\u2019s not just working down there by his own admission", "No bro, when I mean working, I mean having a fight with my IDE until shit works, and when I mean networking, I mean talking to my team on Slack. Speaking to your team is as important as doing the work itself. Also can be spent reading doc. \n\nThen after finishing, I can game for like an hour before going up.", "I have noticed people cite their \u201cnetworking\u201d time as why they can\u2019t attend to some obligation, especially when that obligation is their family, it\u2019s almost always bullshit to cover up some sort of social goofing off", "I share my bedroom with my partner. I do not think he'd be stoked if I filled it with bikes and craft projects.", "The bedroom is shared space lol it\u2019s not hard to grasp", "You can read but struggle with comprehension, apparently.", "Op wrote that when kid is at school, wife has time to work and SOMETIMES be alone. She's working. OP is not working during the 8+ hours he spends there during the weekend.", "And that's why she needs him? \n\nAsking him to spend time with their kid is when she would have alone time. \n\nHe's ignoring her boundaries and requests for him to do the very basics of being part of a shared household and taking care of his kid.", "Manipulative helplessness is definitely a problem. But we really don't know their dynamics. My friend has 5 kids. She was on her 3rd kid when she realized she actually didn't want her husband to help. That she did have very specific ways of doing or preferring things and it was just easier for her to do it than complain about it. My ex-step mom was the same way, just more miserable about it.\n\nMy husband and I are much better about communicating. I've made it clear to him that if he wants me to do a certain chore, it's not going to be done exactly how he wants it. I have my own way of folding clothes, for example, but he wants his done department store style. I'm not doing that.", "Agreed. I was basing my comment on the agreement from the previous commenter that 4 hrs a weekend is nothing for competent parents. 4 hours/day would be YTA territory.", "If a family can't spare two hours for the adults to unwind, then I feel sorry for them. I come from a family of seven, and even my parents had healthy boundaries of work/home/family. Dad would wake up long before anybody else to work on his projects and mom would stay up late to do hers, alternating depending on the day because 5 kids requires fluidity. I can't imagine any relationship surviving while the parents lose their identities and passions because they can't figure out a schedule.", "You're incorporating your own personal bias and making assumptions in the scenario. Great attempt though.", "That\u2019s a little different than 10 hours a week in a bunker.", "Stop gaming for an hour (let's be real....it can be two or three hours, right?) every effing day while your wife takes care of everything else.", "Again, selfish. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be a husband or parent, if the bunker is so much more important to you?", "So what I will say is that thank you for clearing it up.   \n\n\nHowever, I am still keeping my judgement because while it's not as bad as I first interpreted it, it's still not good. You are prioritizing your games over your growing family. Even though you think it's not a lot, your wife obviously feels different, and if you don't change your habits, it's going to be your ex wife soon enough.", "Wait so you have your own bunker equivalent and the rest of your house is communal space with \u201cpersonal\u201d bedrooms? Other than the obvious thing I said was wrong, family abandonment, how do you differ from OP?", "Can tell you're in this exact situation. Sorry for you. You just want to argue, and I'm not your baby daddy.", "So if dad is having me time in the morning and mom has me time at night, and the rest of the day is kid time. When is couple time? Just curious since this made it seem very easy. We have two kids only and we certainly have to work hard for me time and couple time.", "You\u2019re defending someone else\u2019s behavior that 99% of people are able to agree is shitty but somehow you think it\u2019s just great.  Great attempt at trying to justify it, but no one agrees with you.", "Yeah, I see how bad it sounds. Year sometimes can be 2 hours, but hear me out. I usually don't play online games, but single player games with a linear story and clear objectives.\n\nSo is easy to do the \"Till next check point\" (Tho modern games can be saved at whatever point) and log out. \n\nYeah I think I should stop doing this or do it inside the house.", "I said that my entire home is communal family space or personal bedrooms. There are no bunkers, for anyone (my husband arguably could call his workshop a bunker but he uses it responsibly).", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\n\nDon't you worry, buddy. My situation is very different. What a bizarre and patronising take.", ".... What? Of course it isn't easy, it's parenting. I think you need to re-read your comment and realize that you're arguing against your own point here. Do you not understand that... Both parents could stay up late? And while we're allowing other speculations of parenthood, involve a babysitter?", "IMO (I'm not the person you were asking) the trick is stacking: my big mental-health priorities exercise and gardening (...both of which also are borderline chores). So I take the kid on hikes/bikes, and set up his tractors in a bare patch of dirt while I plant. That kind of combining buys us couple time because then I don't need to work out after he goes to bed (for example). I still don't have a great sense of where true regular solo time (that isn't also exercising or doing a chore) comes in, but maybe someday. tl;dr - something has to give  - you chose the things that matter to you. I'd be annoyed if my husband consistently chose bunker time over couple time or long-haul weekend parenting.", "I'm a gamer. I get it. I didn't pick up my sticks from birth to age 5. It's not a hobby that is condusive to raising small kids. \n\nGet a mobile game on your phone or something that can easily be put down at a moments notice. But at least be in the same damn room, dude. \n\nMy kid is 7 and I'm finally ready to engage in RPCs again. I finally ordered Hogwarts Legacy and im stoked to play it *with my kid.* \n\nThis is adulthood. Our hobbies take a back seat to parenting.", "That hour or two or more, your wife is in the house alone, parenting your child while pregnant and shattered. Honestly, you just can\u2019t have a lifestyle where you get to hang out alone out of your house for hours every day doing what you want when you have a young kid and soon a baby too. You\u2019re acting as though you\u2019re a single guy with no responsibilities for hours every day, and that means your wife picking up the slack. This will affect your relationship with your wife, who will start to resent you getting to dip in and out when you wish, and your child who will learn that you\u2019re prioritising your alone time over spending time with them.", "Every time something is followed with \u201cbut hear me out\u201d - it immediately negates whatever type of acknowledgment you made. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cno offense, but \u2026\u201d and then it\u2019s always followed by something offensive. Or, one I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve used plenty of times OP, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel this way\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t understand where I\u2019m coming from\u201d (which is such a rude, passive aggressive way of actually saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care how you feel at all, you\u2019re being emotional\u201d). \n\nSo just checking OP, how many more sub par excuses are you gonna throw out there before you actually step up and be a present husband and father? Or if you don\u2019t want to, let your wife and kids go, so they can have a wonderful and happy life without you.", "When does your wife get 2 hrs to herself daily?", "DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF??\n\nI feel for your preggo wife so deeply.", "I agree but besides the responsibilities and the picking up slack, I really wonder when he lives a relationship with her outside of chores, childcare and some sex. Especially when children come along it's important to not neglect the relationship and I just can't see how he can be an employee, a father, a gamer on this level and still have time to be a husband"]}
