Yes, he was a crazy man. My dad inherited his house but never lived there, so when I had my first child in 2018 and got married in 2019, my dad made me an incredibly generous offer for the house. I bought computers that were more expensive than the house.\n\nThe bunker became kind of an urban legend, mostly because my old grandpa used to tell a lot of crazy stories, but out of curiosity I went looking for it and found the entrance. THE OLD MAN REALLY DID IT! \n\nSo, thanks to being stuck at home during the uneventful 2020 and 2021, I started remodeling the bunker to look less like a Fallout Vault and more like my own man cave. Everyone loves it, especially the kids (My nephews and friend's children). So the house is decorated to my wife's taste, while I can do whatever I want in the bunker, play gaming, fix computers, set up a whole home server, work from home, etc.\n\nHowever, lately she has been complaining about me being distant and spending a lot of time there and less time with her and our child. She is pregnant again, so she said she was worried, but I just promised to spend more time at the house. After a few weeks that wasn't enough for her and she accuses me of abandoning her.\n\nI'm asking for judgment here because I'm trying to be there for my family, but this bunker feels like it's the only thing that's really mine and where I can actually have a break, but my wife has said she's going to seal the entrance otherwise I might miss the birth and not even notice. Should I just move all my stuff into the house and forget about it? Am I really being neglectful, or is this just her pregnancy hormones talking?\n\nTo be clear, I do help with the house chores and spend time with my son when I'm there and I have an intercom in the bunker so my wife can just call me if she needs anything and I'll go up there immediately.\n\nETA: Everybody is asking me this. I spends at least 6 hours at the Bunker on week days. I work there so I think is reasonable, and at least 4 hours on weekends. But yeah, ur right, I need to make arrangements.\n\nI forgot to mention: Our son goes to kindergarten so my wife has time to work and sometimes be alone at home.\n\nETA 2: Guys, I swear I'm taking notes. I'm just trying to understand what I should change about myself and how to talk to my wife about this. Remember that I spend at least 6 hours WORKING, not scratching my belly. My manager allows me to log out early if I finished my work for the day but can't log out if I've been working for less than 6 hours. I also spend time talking with my team on Slack.\n\nETA 3: So many of you are picking up on my language. I would appreciate if you explain **calmly** why my choice of words is so bad so I dont fuck things up when I speak to my wife.\n\nMini-Update: I had a talk with my wife. Overall I think it went well since she told me everything, but there are so many raw emotions right now and I was sent to sleep in the spare room. She had no mercy on me but we needed this talk so we can have a clear path for our future together.", "created_utc": 1684767975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13oti3c/aita_for_spending_a_lot_of_time_in_my_bunker_away/", "score": 6431, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She also has to physically contact you via an intercom to come and do a chore or look after the child etc. I understand when you are working you need to focus on that but the amount of time you spend there, especially on weekends is much too long.

To me, 2 hours of your work day is spent outside of your work place. The weekends however is gonna be up to y'all and coming to a common ground. I like people being around even when I'm doing my own thing separate from them, so it could be just the isolation or being removed from being nearby.

If she starts telling friends a similar version of this story, it's going to be very hard for you to come out looking like a good guy. \n\nThe desire for personal space in the early years of child rearing isn't really a thing.

Schizophrenia is known to run in families. \n\nFrom what you've described you are:\n\nChoosing to spend a significant portion of your time in an isolated space created by your schizophrenic relative. A space created by them when they were experiencing a lot of painful and powerful symptoms in relation to that diagnosis. \n\nYou are spending upwards of several hours in that space at a time without leaving at all I presume based on what you've written here. So your family is right by you, and yet you're socially withdrawing into this space. This isn't a criticism on you wanting a space to yourself, everyone deserves that much, but what is concerning here is how long each stretch of time you spend down there is. We're not described a net total of 6 hours with you taking frequent breaks to go and catch some proper sunshine and check in on your family, what we're reading is that you go in there for 6 hours at a time. That is very concerning. \n\nAnother thing is that you're going through some serious stress right now: an expanding family with this second pregnancy. Assuming that you've been frequenting this bunker before your wife's second pregnancy, the issue has accumulated because you are either spending more time there net total or you're leaving the bunker less frequently while your wife is experiencing a particular stress in her life that calls for extra support and attention to her. **A serious level of stress can trigger an onset of schizophrenia when you may have demonstrated absolutely 0 signs of having a predisposition to this prior.** \n\nWhat you're describing can be the product of a short-sighted response to new levels of stress and life changes, **or** it can be the very early signs of an onset of schizophrenia. T**he earliest signs are: social withdrawal, blunted emotions, having difficulty speaking and looking at faces, isolating yourself, deterioration of hygiene, etc.** And in the likely case that you shrug this concern off with *\"nothing I'm doing is that out there, I just need to rearrange the way I'm doing things\"* I'm not going to try to convince you that you need help based on only the vaguest of signs. **BUT, if you EVER find yourself experiencing: a sudden sensitivity to light and sound, feeling unable to organize your thoughts or speech, finding yourself acting/responding in ways that you never would have before, or feeling a sense of powerful anxiety or dread without being able to identify a clear source to this sensation, SEEK HELP IMMEDIATELY.** \n\nAnd to end this dreadful response on a gentler note: **schizophrenia is manageable** nowadays with the treatment options available in comparison to what was around in your grandfather's time. There are **many** notable names in academia and the career fields out there who live with schizophrenia. When one relative has schizophrenia, the chances of any descending relatives having a predisposition goes up tremendously. **You and your wife really need to have some discussions between yourselves or with a professional who can answer your questions on what you should do if you ever notice the early signs in one of your children or yourself. This is a terrifying possibility to consider and respond to preemptively I know, but having a plan in case this scenario comes about will keep the path to treatment and a full life clear in comparison to simply assuming this could never come about.**", "Ypu can break up the work day by having lunch with your wife.

While this attitude is understandable,  it really needs to change.  I think OP's wife shares a little bit of this attitude,  believing that he is just avoiding her when he is in the bunker,  when actually,  that is his office.

Is there any space for her to really make her own. You have this sacred space of things you enjoy and your hobbies (and yes work) maybe she just needs a little space to have her own identity to. \n\nShe just may have some mom guilt saying that.

Possibly she\u2019s not sure how her identity fits with yours because although I\u2019m sure you have changed and grown as you both became parents, she sees you getting to be who she\u2019s probably known and loves you for and needs some reassurance that she still fits as she learns who she is now. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s room for a she shed \ud83d\ude02 or maybe giving her a few hours a couple times a week to disconnect and go be her would be equivalent.

Most tv shows and movies last a shorter amount of time than a typical, satisfying gaming session. Most people don\u2019t have the patience to read for as long as they would game, either. It\u2019s hard to play, say, Legend of Zelda Tears or the Kingdom, for 40 minutes and then stop. That\u2019s just the pacing of most games.\n\nWhile it is technically possible to spend similar amounts of time each day gaming as enjoying another hobby, it\u2019s not likely or common. Much more common among people like me (who still have loads of responsibilities and chores) is gaming for longer periods of time, less frequently. It\u2019s kind of like playing golf that way. \n\nA lot of gamers insist on playing every day, for 2 hours or more.

Sometimes, I can handle that--a little chore here, clean something there, take a break and think. \n\nBut other times, I can't. If I allow myself to get distracted, it'll be four hours later and I won't have gotten anything accomplished. \n\nJust like there are people who work well from home and those who do not, there are people who can easily shift between working and home and people who cannot. \n\nOP's in a bit of a weird position here. I respect his desire for his own space, presuming there's enough space for his wife to have her own space, too. And I respect his potential need for a distraction-free work environment. But I also respect his wife's having to deal with a kid and a pregnancy.\n\nHonestly, except for the four hours a day on the weekends, I think OP's doing the best he can here. He's in a separate workspace, but he has an intercom or at least a cell phone so he can come up if his wife needs him. He's working during the workday, and he even works *fewer* hours than most on top of having eliminated his commute. This is arguably a much better situation than most couples handling pregnancy would find themselves in.", "That's fair,  if it's 12 hours that's a very different story", "I substituted fabric crafts.

When retreating to one's own space means the other person is stuck with the lion's share of the child care, that's when the separate spaces becomes a huge problem.  Unless you're rich enough to afford nannies and governesses to take care of the kids and maids to clean the place.    \n\n\nI love watching rich people period dramas a la Downton Abbey because everyone gets their own space and no one has to worry about taking care of kids or doing housework, though at least some of my ancestors were the ones who did that kind of work.

I didn't get a bathroom of my own until I was 22 and it was a studio apartment with a kitchenette.  \n\n\nBack to OP, notice he doesn't take the son, who is kindergarten age, into the man cave.  Yet his nephews an friends' kids love it.  So it sounds like kids who are old enough not to break his stuff spend time there, but not his own kid so much.  \n\n\nUntil I got to the son/pregnant wife part, I was ready to issue a Not the AH for the reason you mention.

Does the kid have arrangements for when mommy needs time for herself? Is it as much time as dad has? Do they at all discuss when he's going to disappear into his bunker or is he just gone? Is 'her' space 100% communal? Does decorate to her taste mean he did not help at all? Did he give her the option of sharing the bunker?", "Lol no, I'm saying that the guy spends a total of four hours per week im his man cave doing his own thing. That's not unreasonable at all, and people railing against it seem to believe that 100% of his time not working should be spent serving his wife and kid. The wife should, and probably does, get the same thing.", "I agree with your overall premise, but based on him saying it's six hours per weekday and 4 hours per weekend, I would say the default is 4 hours each weekend day or 8 total. Otherwise he would say 30 hours during the week and 4 hours on the weekend. So therefore it is 8 hours over two days.", "I absolutely agree that both parents in a family deserve their  alone time and own space. However, where is her own space? She may have \u201cdecorated\u201d the house but it\u2019s still a shared space. Plus, I\u2019m not convinced she\u2019s getting complete alone time either as being in the house = responsibilities of the house.", "The one singular reasonable person I've seen in this thread", "From a numerical standpoint--weekends aside, because that is y-t-a amount of time--OP is present in the house for his family significantly more often than people who have a traditional work environment. So to some, it looks an awful lot like OP's wife is demanding more time of him than would be reasonable to expect from someone else. I don't necessarily agree or disagree with that statement, but it's not without evidence.\n\nBut it's important to remember that having the privilege of working from home doesn't mean having the privilege of being able to drop everything you're doing at work all the time. It's damn difficult, and I'd argue that this one absolutely *is* unfair, to expect someone to be fully present at work and also fully present at home. \n\nOP's situation might be a little different, because he's not super clear on exactly how much time he *is* spending instead of \"at least\" how much he's spending, but OP aside it's not at all unfair for people who work from home to keep their distance while they're at work. \n\nI've worked from home for several years now. I'm good at it. But there was a time when I had the video games up, sitting on voice chat with my friends, Netflix on the other screen, and it turns out that it's really damn difficult to work in those conditions. If OP's working to the point where he's getting everything done early all the time, that's pretty significant evidence that he's not sitting there playing games all day. \n\nI've also been the caretaker, though not for a pregnancy. Turns out, running around investigating every little need someone else has is *also* a bad way to get work done. \n\nEither one of those things if left uncontrolled tends to end in a firing or a requirement to be in-office. It's not fair here to suggest that OP is sitting there playing video games chatting to friends while his wife toils away.", "Agreed with everything you said.

Okay, I guess I hadn't thought about that part fully (math skills are a little off, lol) so, yeah... I can see that being an issue...

People should be able to separate them in order to have a break from each.", "Bad bot", "I mean, yes. He has a pregnant wife and a 5yo. If you have kids you\u2019re mostly giving up your weekends until they\u2019re teens who don\u2019t want you around anymore. \n\nMultiple children who all play different sports / do different activities? It\u2019s madness! \n\nAnd when your child/children is/are otherwise engaged you need to prioritise spending some down time together to keep your relationship  strong. \n\nOf course you should both get some time off to do things you like with friends or alone; but it has to be equal. \u2018I get a couple of hours on Saturday and you get the same on Sunday\u2019 or \u2018she\u2019s going to this concert with her friends this weekend and next weekend I\u2019m going to the pub with mine\u2019 kinda thing. \n\nIf only one partner gets time off every weekend that is not equitable or fair and it will end up destroying their relationship.", "from his edits, he's literally locked in until his wife buzzes him\n\nalso it's a literally bunker meaning it has all the necessities for him to survive; dude is literally not leaving there for a few hours straight every day\n\nwork aside, he said he's been gaming multiple hours alone there\n\nsounds like he should focus on his pregnant wife and kid instead", "I\u2019m lucky that my partner  tolerates my stuff that is not their taste.   I don\u2019t put it all over and definitely more in some spaces and none in others. Not all my friends are so lucky.  In fact an 18 inch Treebeard is looking at me right now next to some bobble heads, a survivor puzzle and a couple of spaceships with working lights and sounds.", "This! I didn\u2019t get the feeling from OP that wife is at ALL asking for her own private time. Rather the opposite - she wants more togetherness!", "I think watching sports on TV is the only comparable activity because it's a passion that people get very upset if it is interrupted. If you're working on your car or doing some woodworking, then your spouse can get your attention and assistance right away without anyone being too bothered. If you're gaming, especially with a headset, you're basically checked out and not going to be receptive to interruptions. Golfing for an hour each workday and 4 hours a day on the weekends would also be a dick move if you're married with children.\n\nIt's not about the hobby, it's about how immersed many people get in it causing them to be basically absent partners.", "Yep, I always read these with a grain of salt, knowing that most people, unless they're in an abusive situation and their barometer is totally messed up, are going to try to make themselves look better.", "\"we just ask\"\n\nHe expects her to ask for help. When does he ask for help? Likely doesn't because she's proactively dealing with the issue already.", "I'm a woman and understand the concept and importance of a man cave, as I do for a \"woman cave\" too.\n\nI believe both party in a relationship, especially with kids, should have an equivalent amount of time alone if they feel like it while their partner would watch the kids for them.\n\nEveryone needs alone time, it's not a gender thing, but it HAS to be reciprocated and not only a neerdy guy thing, either with man cave or time with the boys.", "Wifey and I have our own separate \"sanctuaries\" - we call them \"Man Cave\" and \"Mom Cave\" respectively (even though wifey isn't a mom just yet >\\_>), they were our rooms to decorate as we pleased - the living room TV was first in, first preference, the other person could always hang out in their 'cave' and watch their own show/play a game/whatever else :)  (Personally I use my 'cave' for my side job, crafting stuff to take to farmers markets.)", "You're making a ton of assumptions, every single one of them assuming the best about the wife's intentions and the worst about his. Why?", "and she works outside of the house, too", "How much time does he spend with his son?", "I\u2019m a wife who doesn\u2019t want her husband to have a say in decorating but he does. I wasn\u2019t always like this but I\u2019ve learnt that him having a say means nothing ever gets done. He\u2019ll keep procrastinating and then finally tell me to get it done and then complain about how I\u2019ve done it. He has a lot to say but doesn\u2019t help at all. Not even in making choices that literally take minimal effort and time. He won\u2019t do any research and just think that he\u2019ll magically know what looks good. Which predictably will NOT look good and then complain that other people have better houses. He has actively prevented me from getting sideboards or cabinets or anything to store things in our house and then turns around and complains about the clutter that inevitably arises. Some people should just know when to bow out.", "Imagine needing him to mind the children for a couple minutes so she can poop, or change her pads after passing giant clots, and having to buzz him and wait for him to come back. Or she having to buzz him and tell him why she needs him NOW, IN FRONT OF THE PEOPLE who \"love the bunker\".", "I\u2019m not innocent myself, but for me, DH wants All Dark Wood, All The Time and furniture that can withstand teenage boys throwing themselves on it. We don\u2019t have teenage boys and the one boy we do have isn\u2019t rough and tumble. I feel claustrophobic in that environment, but it\u2019s only been in the last two years that he\u2019s been willing to give me anything to work with for compromise. \n\nOur gaming computers are in the main living area with the nerd crap arranged around them, though.", "Seriously, my partner and I decorated our apartment together once we had enough money that we could get things that matched and not whatever we found at hippie christmas. I would be overwhelmed if I had to decorate an entire house by myself!", "This sounds like the beginning of a Stephen King novel.", "She sent you to sleep in the spare room and you snuck out to the bunker, right?", "OP needs to build his wife a She-Shed. YTA, but I do appreciate his desire to better himself.", "And yet folks wonder why women are opting out of relationships and kids...", "The 6 hours/day on weekdays is work from home.", "Oh my god this so hard", "so how does he do 6 hours work a day with no internet or phone service?", "She radiated awesomeness", "I send the kids in to make sure daddy\u2019s awake \ud83d\ude02 they come in when I\u2019m going to the bathroom, why not him get the same visitations?!?", "Have him checked out at the dr. Request a colonoscopy. Rectal cancer isn\u2019t called the silent killer without reason. Long bathroom visits were the first sign and we should have pushed the dr harder.", "Haha.. I love that: \"begone!\"...\nI feel being reasonable (when it calls for it, like here) sometimes is a good policy", "Do you have to call him on an intercom for that?", "One of the awesome parts of my ex being an ex is that I get to choose everything in my own house.  Everything I liked was shot down, and overtime that shit is draining."]}
