Yes, he was a crazy man. My dad inherited his house but never lived there, so when I had my first child in 2018 and got married in 2019, my dad made me an incredibly generous offer for the house. I bought computers that were more expensive than the house.\n\nThe bunker became kind of an urban legend, mostly because my old grandpa used to tell a lot of crazy stories, but out of curiosity I went looking for it and found the entrance. THE OLD MAN REALLY DID IT! \n\nSo, thanks to being stuck at home during the uneventful 2020 and 2021, I started remodeling the bunker to look less like a Fallout Vault and more like my own man cave.

So the house is decorated to my wife's taste, while I can do whatever I want in the bunker, play gaming, fix computers, set up a whole home server, work from home, etc.\n\nHowever, lately she has been complaining about me being distant and spending a lot of time there and less time with her and our child. She is pregnant again, so she said she was worried, but I just promised to spend more time at the house. After a few weeks that wasn't enough for her and she accuses me of abandoning her.\n\nI'm asking for judgment here because I'm trying to be there for my family, but this bunker feels like it's the only thing that's really mine and where I can actually have a break, but my wife has said she's going to seal the entrance otherwise I might miss the birth and not even notice. Should I just move all my stuff into the house and forget about it? Am I really being neglectful, or is this just her pregnancy hormones talking?\n\nTo be clear, I do help with the house chores and spend time with my son when I'm there and I have an intercom in the bunker so my wife can just call me if she needs anything and I'll go up there immediately.\n\nETA: Everybody is asking me this. I spends at least 6 hours at the Bunker on week days. I work there so I think is reasonable, and at least 4 hours on weekends.

In general, it's good for both spouses to get time to themselves while the other one handles their shared responsibilities. \n\nNot right now though, because your wife is pregnant. You can't take over being pregnant from her so she can have an evening off, which means you are not entitled to time off either.

It doesn\u2019t sound like your wife gets \u201coff\u201d time like you do, if she is in the house doing a hobby of hers your young child is still there with her and she still has to keep an eye on the child and if they are young usually entertain them the whole time, whereas if your in your bunker the child is not coming down there with you where you are actually watching them while doing your hobby. She also has to physically contact you via an intercom to come and do a chore or look after the child etc. I understand when you are working you need to focus on that but the amount of time you spend there, especially on weekends is much too long.

But you might want to talk to your wife about some expectations. You work from home in there and spend 6 hours minimum there? That's entirely reasonable. I've had to have conversations where if I am working from home it doesn't mean I'm on vacation and I'm just available all the time. To me, 2 hours of your work day is spent outside of your work place. The weekends however is gonna be up to y'all and coming to a common ground. I like people being around even when I'm doing my own thing separate from them, so it could be just the isolation or being removed from being nearby.

What \"healthy\" looks like depends on a reasonable discussion between the two of you. \n\nThat being said, from a pragmatic point of view, the optics aren't great for you. If she starts telling friends a similar version of this story, it's going to be very hard for you to come out looking like a good guy. \n\nThe desire for personal space in the early years of child rearing isn't really a thing. Like, does your wife have it? Where can she go to be alone? How can she initiate that if you are already bunkered down? You might consider some proactive offers for her to rest, perhaps even bringing the child\\[ren\\] to hang out with you so that she has the run of the home to do Homealone things. \n\nThis can probably all be solved with a good conversation, but I would urge you to be proactive about the optics.

Like always having dinner together, making a plan for the household chores & childcare responsibilities, trying to compare expectations, making a point to fit quality time in your schedule etc?\n\nRather than vaguely \"promise to spend more time at the house\" maybe make a concrete agreement so you can show you did your part & it isn't up to subjective arguments of how much is 'enough' time. \n\nI think there can probably still be a diplomatic solution here if you talk to each other & try to have an open ear for each other's needs (which must include your needs to have a private place to recharge, but also that you do your part with childcare & house chores)", "INFO\n\nYou very overstressed.

Poor wife is preggers and not getting a break yet OP is cool to sit and play video games elsewhere.", "And his username literally being bunker man", "Yeah, yta, I could get behind the wfh during the week and some gaming on the weekend, but 4 hours a day on the weekend?! That's to much, that's not a break or time out. When do you spend time with your wife? She is pregnant, you have a kid, but you prefer your man cave for this many hours, no, sorry, just no! You're not single anymore. I mean, do you like your wife and kid? Why don't you want to spend more time with them? I am not even talking about chores or child care, but if I look at a weekend and take all the time of chores and child care away, you seem to spend the rest of the day in your cave.\n\nHaving an intercom doesn't change that, since it puts her in the position to tell you if you are needed instead of you pulling your weight and her having practically to beg you to want to spend time with her.", "6 hours daily ??", "If you actually wanted a reasonable judgement, you would give much better time estimates than this.", "This is where I struggle to understand my own generation. Six HOURS? Like, I wanna say the most I have EVER spent playing a video game in one sitting is like 45 minutes, I just don't understand this mindset (when I call it an addiction I get flak, but whatever). \n\nYou're not talking about a break dude. You're talking about an escape from reality and avoiding responsibility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNever though I'd have to say this, but: get out of your bunker and help your family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA by the way.", "Yeah, buy a mirror and really ask yourself if you are not slowly become your grandpa if you keep going like this", "Still doesn\u2019t change that YTA and came here hopeful to find an echo chamber for your opinions OP.", "Does your wife understand that working from home doesn't mean the same as available to do anything? Has she been demanding attention for herself at the cost of you spending time on yourself?", "He works there though. I think we need more details. If 5 hours of those 6 are working hours, then that seems pretty reasonable to me.", "Then I'd just tweak the circumstance a little and say, \"Its movie night in the man cave honey. Would you like a mystery, and action movie, or a rom com.\"\n\nIts hard for me to appreciate that someone else longs for my company, particularly when they are doing something I don't care about and we're still at home together. But, its not worth it to me to become fussy about it.\n\nSo, good luck. Just tweak things a little so she isn't going looking for you and feels included?", "He said that he works from home.", "He works there.", "No bro, believe me, I'm reading and paying attention, I just need to think cold headed.", "He also said he doesn\u2019t work weekends yet still spends that amount of time on his days off there too :)", "Not on weekends, as we already established. \n\nSpending 4-6 hours per day in there on your days off is *not* being there for your family.", "He said the kids like being in there. So it's not like he's abandoning his family.\n\nHe also does chores and helps out around the house.\n\nSounds to me like the wife needs some friends.", "Yeah his kids aren\u2019t there for that entire time lmao\n\nBut yeah let\u2019s all blame the woman rather than the man who\u2019s refusing to sacrifice his fun time for his family\u2026 she\u2019s just hysterical with pregnancy emotions o.O", "What are you on about?\n\nHe modified his behavior to spend more time with the family.\n\nTHEN she claims that he is abandoning her.\n\nGot drama much?", "Curious if you have kids yourself..", "I do. I'm a single dad whose life pretty much consists of work and raising my daughter.\n\nMy ex also suffered from post partum depression.\n\nSo I've got a pretty good idea, based on first hand experience, of how having a baby can affect a woman's mood.\n\nBut by all means. Go on about whatever you want to be on about.", "Yeah I wasn\u2019t asking to see if you had experience with a woman\u2019s mood.\n\nSorry but spending 4-6 hours a day in a bunker on your days off is definitely not being there for your family. And I feel sorry for the family of anyone that does."]}
