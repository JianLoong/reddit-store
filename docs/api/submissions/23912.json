He got fired from his last big job a few years ago and went part time at a different company but was at least paying utilities (after we started seeing a therapist who put him in his place a bit). After he started at his new job, it came out that he had been cheating on me for YEARS and part of that was how emasculated I made him feel, etc. \n\nWe went to a new therapist who specializes in infidelity and were trying to move past it for the sake of our child. He did do a lot of work on himself and made substantial changes on his behavior at that point, but for other reasons I just wasn\u2019t feeling happy and asked if we could separate. He was never financially able to move out on his own so we just separated within the house and did the best we could. During this time, he was trying to win me back and was so sweet and caring that after a year of us being separated, I took him back. Part of our agreement was that he would pay me a certain amount in \u201crent\u201d to help out and make me feel less burdened. After that, I never once saw even a penny toward the amount he told me. It\u2019s been excuse after excuse about how he cut back his hours to spend more time with us(but honestly he spends most of his time sleeping or playing video games) and I\u2019m just feeling lost again.

Plus, it doesn't seem like he is going to change regarding the work situation and he keeps sort of failing at work so he's clearly not motivated and kind of floating. What worries me is if you do divorce is it a risk you'll end up paying him alimony or child support and still end up subsidizing him? Is that worth having him out of your hair?
