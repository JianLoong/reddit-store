He got fired from his last big job a few years ago and went part time at a different company but was at least paying utilities (after we started seeing a therapist who put him in his place a bit). After he started at his new job, it came out that he had been cheating on me for YEARS and part of that was how emasculated I made him feel, etc. \n\nWe went to a new therapist who specializes in infidelity and were trying to move past it for the sake of our child. He did do a lot of work on himself and made substantial changes on his behavior at that point, but for other reasons I just wasn\u2019t feeling happy and asked if we could separate. He was never financially able to move out on his own so we just separated within the house and did the best we could. During this time, he was trying to win me back and was so sweet and caring that after a year of us being separated, I took him back. Part of our agreement was that he would pay me a certain amount in \u201crent\u201d to help out and make me feel less burdened. After that, I never once saw even a penny toward the amount he told me. It\u2019s been excuse after excuse about how he cut back his hours to spend more time with us(but honestly he spends most of his time sleeping or playing video games) and I\u2019m just feeling lost again.

Plus, it doesn't seem like he is going to change regarding the work situation and he keeps sort of failing at work so he's clearly not motivated and kind of floating. What worries me is if you do divorce is it a risk you'll end up paying him alimony or child support and still end up subsidizing him? Is that worth having him out of your hair?

And once again, while I commend your empathy and caring about what happens your husband if you guys do divorce, that is ultimately up to him to figure out. You\u2019re not his mom.", "Came here to say exactly this but you\u2019ve said it perfectly already. The damage that was done to me because I was that kid is unfathomable. Raised to believe as a woman I was basically a worthless doormat to be taken advantage of, and then the \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for you, I could have left him\u201d speeches from my mother (she still wouldn\u2019t have done it, she was and always will be a coward looking for an excuse not to act). \n\nThe best interests of the child is ALWAYS to split in these situations, and to model some self respect. I\u2019m not even convinced they will miss the useless lump they call daddy at all, if all he does is sleep and play games, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll be missing out on quality time.", "This \ud83d\ude4c", "The second and only time I've actually seen \"hobosexual\" used in a sentence. Well played!", "I\u2019m so sorry. You were a child and didn\u2019t deserve that guilt.", "My best friend was in the absolute same situation and her bf ended up cheating on her and trying to insist that they stay together and she just doesn't ask questions while also still paying the bills. Of course she dumped him. Well guess what, now that it's less practical, he is an absent father because making efforts was never something he did, even for his son. He is also still mad that my best friend didn't keep playing mother to him, because that is what it was.\n\nYou have wasted 20 years, do not waste more because at some point you'll be thinking it's been so long, you have to stay now. You only have 1 life so don't ruin it for someone else's who just does not care about you.\n\nProceed with the divorce, don't ask your husband for his opinion and do not allow him to play room mate with you. He is out. You owe your kid to see what healthy relationships are.", "You don't have to be married to him to coparent.", "We do repeat the behavioirs that were modelled to us when we grew up.\n\nNot what a parent later tell us to do and accept.", "NTA. This is no longer a marriage, he gets to quit his job as and when he pleases, rely on your finances, be the fun parent whilst you don\u2019t get a break AND he gets to cheat on you cus he felt emasculated. That\u2019s not your fault OP that\u2019s his own insecurity and it\u2019s not your job to make feel like a man \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\n\nPlease tell me wtf does your husband actually want cus you\u2019ve bent over backwards to make it all with no little effort from him. It\u2019s just the bare minimum. Do you think this fair?\n\nOP if this how it\u2019s always been for TWENTY YEARS then you need to drop his lazy effing ass. Hopefully your kid grows up to realise the sort of life you\u2019ve been living because of him and won\u2019t blame you.\n\n A person can\u2019t change unless they really want to and your husband definitely doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry but there\u2019s nothing more I can think of you can do to salvage your marriage."]}
