One thing he does have is money, but that was not helping him. He tried meeting women and wasn't having much luck because frankly he wasn't looking in his own age range. He always wanted to have more kids (my mom only wanted 2) and now he wants more kids even at his age.   \n\n\nSomehow or another, he met May. He won't tell me how and I didn't hear about her until he had already asked her to marry him. Without ever meeting in person. May is from a country in southeast Asia where fraud, identity theft, trafficking, and crime of all kinds is rampant. I told my father under no circumstances was he to go to May's country, so he agreed to meet her for a vacation in a third country (known safe tourist destination) she could get a visa to. The meeting went well, so we agreed to have a family vacation in that same tourist destination where my sibling and I could meet May. May also brought who she said was her 13 year old son.   \n\n\nMay is nice enough in the meeting but told several lies about inconsequential things, which put me on guard. For example, May said she had been an exchange student in another Asian country where she went to learn that language. I also was an exchange student in that country to learn that language and began speaking it. May was silent. There were a few random things like that. Then, there was her son. That person is not 13 years old. He's small, he's slight, especially compared to westerners, but he is a grown man. He speaks in a falsetto, but I heard him on the phone when he thought he was alone (yes, I did follow him), and he was not using the falsetto at all. I also followed May when May took a phone call, and something very similar took place.   \n\n\nThere is a weird vibe between May and her \"son\", and after I heard them speaking on the phone, it made a lot more sense. I honestly believe the two of them are in a relationship, and let's just say, I don't think May has the ability to give my father the babies he wants, as she is leading him to believe.   \n\n\nMay and her son both entered this country on passports with information that matches their claimed identities, but May's country is absolutely notorious for producing false documentation and identity theft.   \n\n\nI told my sibling this, and they basically think I am the scum of the earth for saying or even thinking any of these things. They think I should butt out and leave my father to his happiness. I on the other hand think my father's happiness is a lie, and at best, May could take him for half his retirement savings, and at worst, my father could be convinced to go to a country where a lot worse could happen to him.", "created_utc": 1669394191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4hpz7/aita_for_questioning_the_entire_identity_of_my/", "score": 442, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can do explorative studies and find correlations between just about anything. \n\nThese studies indicate that there is something to investigate. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nThere is no causative mechanic that is demonstrated by *any of them*.\n\nAs for \"And why do you asume these studies have not acounted for those things\", the answer is simple - because we have no way to account for them. We still don't have anything close to a 100% diagnosis rate. We can't project back and assume anything about someone born in 1960 as to whether or not they are or aren't undiagnosed, only that they don't have a diagnosis.\n\nAnd, once again, even if there were a link, you are advocating for eugenics. Stop doing that.", "Bruh, any con artist is going to tell a rich old man what they want to hear.", "Except that hiring a surrogate means taking official channels, and then raising the child himself. It seems like he feels that his dna is so important that he needs more children and he'll tear a young woman out of her life and country, and risk her life in pregnancy, to do that, knowing she'll be the one left caring for his child.\n\nI have to agree with the others here. They sound like they deserve each other", "Lol, I'll tell May I think the whole thing should be called off since I wouldn't want my father to violently tear her out of her life and country, and risk her life in pregnancy. Should I update with her response?", "NTA. Get a private investigator to fact-check their identities. Your father is not going to be happy that you crushed his fantasy of romance, but if it is a lie, he will be in for years of torment and I would hope if I was in that situation I would bear the brunt of crushing his dreams to protect his safety.", "I would really try and get this confirmed professionally. Your hunches are not enough for what you are attempting to do and if you are wrong it will blow up in your face badly.", "NTA. OP, tell your father everything. Make it clear to him you love him no matter what, but this isn't the woman for him. And if he thinks she really loves him, and he still wants to marry her, make certain he gets a prenup.", "Not to mention he's likely to be dead before the kid finishes high school. Selfish, crummy thing to do, make a kid when you're that old.", "A man wanting what he has to know is a transactional relationship with a younger woman for the purpose of having children he can\u2019t fully raise is multiple levels of bad, yes.  He\u2019s purposefully searching out a someone who will tolerate being treated like a human incubator because she needs/wants money and possibly also a visa.  While sure, plenty of desperate people and gold diggers exist and would in your words \u201cline up for that\u201d, purposefully seeking out and exploiting them is AH behavior.", "I hear you, but when his whole goal is cranking out kids and without knowing his actual age. It's clear he's not looking for an actual relationship and is looking for a bang-maid.

YOU were obviously talking about two people: 1) the person having a baby after retirement and 2) the person doing \u201cinternational fraud, trafficking, and worse\u201d.  There are only two people you are comparing here, your dad and May.  Since your dad is OBVIOUSLY the first person you were talking about, by default that means that May is the second person you were talking about.  So YOU accused her of \u201cinternational fraud, trafficking and worse\u201d.\n\nI did NOT twist your words, I simply read and understood them.  And called you out on it, which is apparently your real problem.

You are essentially saying that women are treated as incubators in most marriages. If that's the case, why are women usually the ones who push hard for marriage while men would rather not? Should I tell my father not to marry May, just (try to) knock her up, so that they know it's real love and not anything to do with money and a visa?", "> good try but I\u2019m happily married to a wonderful man and we\u2019re about to celebrate our 16th anniversary next year.\n\nKeep dreaming", "Ok boomer.

This sounds like a train wreck. Of course NTA but good luck convincing your father. TBH I would hire a REPUTABLE PI because this is shady AF.", "Sounds like a TLC show - 90 days fiance", "NTA. Go over your dad's head though and see what you can do to remove this woman yourself. He is clearly blinded by his own fantasies ATM if he chose to ignore the whole pretending to speak another language thing she did. Your sibling is just wrong but I've noticed it's all too common for people to sit back and watch people they love walk into a trap because they \"don't wanna be rude\". Be fucking rude if someone's future is on the line, ffs. He's about to get scammed!", "Telling the father without concrete proof (that a PI could provide) is likely going to backfire on OP, and could lead the father to not believe it when he is presented with actual proof from a PI. \n\nOP - keep it to yourself & get a PI ASAP.", "NTA hire someone to get to the truth before something bad happens.

You gave her a chance and met her and her \u201cson\u201d, you noticed inconsistencies and odd behavior. I agree with what others are saying it sounds like it\u2019s time to get a professional PI involved cause sadly there are people who will try and scam others out of their money and possessions and it\u2019s especially easy for crooks to find victims through online dating, which I\u2019m 100% positive that\u2019s how your father met \u201cMay\u201d.   \n\nYou sibling is kind of an AH for getting upset that you are suspicious and your father clearly has rose glasses on and is too blind to see. \n\nPlease don\u2019t drop it and hire a PI.

Well what you want is an immigration lawyer to help your pa make sure everything's done right. One you've researched, who is able to spot this kind of scheme.

This is not a relationship of equals.   Most men get women from East Asian countries because they think they'll be submissive and look young longer than a woman from their own country."]}
