One thing he does have is money, but that was not helping him. He tried meeting women and wasn't having much luck because frankly he wasn't looking in his own age range. He always wanted to have more kids (my mom only wanted 2) and now he wants more kids even at his age.   \n\n\nSomehow or another, he met May. He won't tell me how and I didn't hear about her until he had already asked her to marry him. Without ever meeting in person. May is from a country in southeast Asia where fraud, identity theft, trafficking, and crime of all kinds is rampant. I told my father under no circumstances was he to go to May's country, so he agreed to meet her for a vacation in a third country (known safe tourist destination) she could get a visa to. The meeting went well, so we agreed to have a family vacation in that same tourist destination where my sibling and I could meet May. May also brought who she said was her 13 year old son.   \n\n\nMay is nice enough in the meeting but told several lies about inconsequential things, which put me on guard. For example, May said she had been an exchange student in another Asian country where she went to learn that language. I also was an exchange student in that country to learn that language and began speaking it. May was silent. There were a few random things like that. Then, there was her son. That person is not 13 years old. He's small, he's slight, especially compared to westerners, but he is a grown man. He speaks in a falsetto, but I heard him on the phone when he thought he was alone (yes, I did follow him), and he was not using the falsetto at all. I also followed May when May took a phone call, and something very similar took place.   \n\n\nThere is a weird vibe between May and her \"son\", and after I heard them speaking on the phone, it made a lot more sense. I honestly believe the two of them are in a relationship, and let's just say, I don't think May has the ability to give my father the babies he wants, as she is leading him to believe.   \n\n\nMay and her son both entered this country on passports with information that matches their claimed identities, but May's country is absolutely notorious for producing false documentation and identity theft.   \n\n\nI told my sibling this, and they basically think I am the scum of the earth for saying or even thinking any of these things. They think I should butt out and leave my father to his happiness. I on the other hand think my father's happiness is a lie, and at best, May could take him for half his retirement savings, and at worst, my father could be convinced to go to a country where a lot worse could happen to him.", "created_utc": 1669394191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4hpz7/aita_for_questioning_the_entire_identity_of_my/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not saving anyone, just protecting the AH you love from the AH you don't. In a genuinely just world, they'd deserve each other. Whether your father is just a relatively benign misogynist with a saviour complex or a truly gross one who genuinely believes that \"at his age\" (which I have to assume is at least 60s or 70s) he has some sort of innate \"right\" to a young female partner to incubate children for him just because he feels entitled to them, even though he likely won't be able to participate meaningfully in their childhoods or (depending on his age) possibly live well into their adulthoods - and I say that as the very supportive sister and sister-in-law of a couple of 50-somethings who had a surprise baby less than 5 years ago, so I'm pretty open-minded about these things . . .  But whether he actively thinks that women are just there to be his pretty, young, baby-making companions or is just passively selfish, your dad is not the \"good guy\" here. He's just the guy you love. Which is fine, but let's not pretend that he needs \"saving\".  \n\nHe may be naive in some ways, but he's also selfish and only got in this predicament because the nice neighbourhood ladies his own age who likely would have been happy to spend time with him weren't good enough for him. \n\nYou're NTA, but he and May are two of a kind in their own ways.", "Tell him.

He's not going after minors or even especially young adult women. He wants someone who is able to have kids, but a mom type. He believes May's stated age. Just as I think her \"son\" is older than he says, I think May is younger than what she said; i.e., I think the two of them are similar in age, both adults, and both well beyond puberty based on their real voices.

The range is between ~1 and ~1.2%.\n\nThird that range is a U shaped curve. Its just as, if not *more* applicable to younger parents as it is to older ones.\n\nFourth, I would want to review the age of the children in that study as well as the parents. It's entirely possible there's something else at play, such as societal trends resulting in increased levels of engagement with mental health services leading to diagnoses. It's an interesting correlation, but no causative pathway is known at this point.\n\n\nI can't find the actual study, as it doesn't appear to be published yet - it was presented about a month ago, but here's a citation to some of the charts.\nhttps://talker.news/2022/10/21/old-and-young-parents-have-increased-risk-of-kids-with-bipolar-disorder/", "Her actions don\u2019t actually minimize or negate his\u2026 OP I\u2019m sorry but your dad does not look good here.  Neither does May, at all, but that\u2019s separate.", "So a man wanting to marry who he thinks is a grown woman and mom of a teenage boy, have a baby with her, and provide for their new family and her older \"child\" is inherently creepy and horrible? We'll have to agree to disagree. There are millions of women who would line up for that, here, in May's country, or in any country.\n\nIf May wasn't 100% in favor of this and consenting there would be no way for my father to proceed further with her, since we're not allowing him to go to her country, he can only wait for her to come to him."]}
