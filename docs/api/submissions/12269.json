We lived on a suburban street and were the only ones on our block with a swimming pool. We had told our two closest neighbors, who had young children, that they were welcome to bring their kids over as long as they were supervised by a parent. It worked well for a few years.\n\nHowever, one afternoon I looked out and saw at least 20 people in our pool. I went out and asked the neighbor (let\u2019s call her Mary) what was up. She replied it was her daughter\u2019s birthday party. I was upset for a few reasons. She didn\u2019t ask about bringing a whole party over. My husband and I were not invited. When I mentioned this, she said that the party was \u201cjust family,\u201d but there were other neighbors there who were not relatives. We had been friends with Mary\u2019s family for years (we thought), gone out with them, etc.\n\nWe let them stay, as we didn\u2019t want to upset their daughter, but the next day we told them they no longer could use the pool without asking. Mary said we were ridiculous and being petty. It turned into a neighborhood battle. Mutual friends were divided on who was right.\n\nWere we assholes to think Mary took advantage of our hospitality by throwing a pool party without asking or inviting us?", "created_utc": 1678799563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r5r1b/aita_for_cutting_off_a_neighbor_from_using_our/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I take issue when people think my niceness is where they think they can take advantage and I have no problem hiding how insulted/offended I am.

(Another example would be, say, a treehouse that looks really cool but has a rotted out, unstable floor). \n\nIf someone were to get hurt, drown, etc in your pool, it doesn\u2019t matter if you were there or not.  It doesn\u2019t even matter if you weren\u2019t home and were unaware they were using it. You are still legally liable for any injuries because it is your duty as the property owner to put up a fence/locked gate/etc to protect trespassers from injury by keeping them out. \n\n(Note: this is assuming you are in the U.S.  The law will vary in international jurisdictions.)\n\nYour neighbor not only took advantage of you, but she also exposed you to an extraordinary risk of legal action should anything go wrong.

In the mean time, especially with the pandemic, we grew to like the pool as it is great for our kids.\n\nWe only allow our own guests in there, and with kids we have a strict \"parents must be present\" policy.
