She replied it was her daughter\u2019s birthday party. I was upset for a few reasons. She didn\u2019t ask about bringing a whole party over. My husband and I were not invited. When I mentioned this, she said that the party was \u201cjust family,\u201d but there were other neighbors there who were not relatives. We had been friends with Mary\u2019s family for years (we thought), gone out with them, etc.\n\nWe let them stay, as we didn\u2019t want to upset their daughter, but the next day we told them they no longer could use the pool without asking.

My parents were having a party. I can't remember if it was a birthday party or a 4th of July party, which we had every year since my sister and I both have summer birthdays. A group of people, children and adults, were in the pool and we had a bunch of inflatables in the pool as well. My older cousin and I were playing and she was holding me on her hip. It was then I looked down in the water.  It was only a 4ft pool that was round with a deck surrounding it. Adults were everywhere, and even in the pool.  I pointed and asked her, \"why is \"Kid 1\" on the bottom and not moving?\"  Ensue the chaos that erupted and the child was pulled from the pool and given CPR.  The child was saved and brought back to life thankfully but, the point I'm trying to make is things happen so freaking quickly and that was the only time we had a situation that the adults didn't see. It took a 5 year old to notice and ask a question. I shudder to think what would've happened had I not asked my cousin this. \n\nNot to mention the liability you face with your insurance company and literally everything you own if an accident like such happens. I hope you have an umbrella policy on your house. \n\nBe careful, OP.", "NTA  You guys were too nice.  You don't host a party in someone's yard without asking permission and inviting them.
