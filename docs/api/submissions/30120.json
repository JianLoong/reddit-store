He is amazing, but since we moved in together 1-1.5 years ago, we argued about cleaning. He leaves his plate where he was eating, throws dirty clothes on the floor, list goes on. He also has tools and things I have no clue the purpose of to the extent where we don't have a single wall without furniture full of things in a 1 bedroom apartment. Tools usually lie everywhere in the apartment.\n\nI brought this issue when we first moved in. I would clean to feel better, but it seems unfair to me that cleaning a small apartment takes me 2-3 hours instead of what took me 1 before, because of clutter. I tried reminding him, hired a cleaner once, invented a \"box for shit\" where I would put stuff he should put on their places, sent a list of chores with tick boxes. I spoke to his father about this issue. He told me his son is gifted and if he doesn't want to waste his time on cleaning, he shouldn't. \n\nAt some point I stopped giving a shit and cleaning, our home resembles a uni dorm. I enjoy cooking, but I had to stop it to not clean double. But a mix of my emotions, primarily anger didn't go away. \n\nI am very emotional. And he gets super stressed when someone is yelling. Last major argument when I also yelled was in March. We agreed that I wouldn't yell and communicate it with calmer voice, which I would say I was pretty successful up to now, I did elevate it but didn't yell. We agreed that I can cry, because I literally cant help it.\n\nSo 2 days ago he said he would clean to invite guests. This was cancelled, so he cleaned only his desk. Something was stinking so bad, that I complained. He found a days old unfinished meal (we both ate) and threw away into the trashbin. The stinking didn't stop and today I came back from work to this smell with new dirty plates everywhere. He then left to meet a friend/colleague of his without taking the trash. \n\nWhen he came back I started crying and speak in an elevated voice and he stated cleaning. And then I did quite the asshole move - I started to yell intentionally. It was VERY loud. Because my calm voice didn't help the problem at all during all this time and this is the only thing to show him how distressed I am and to actually make him listen. Which I now admit is not the only way. I told him that I did it intentionally.\n\nHe said he questions our relationship because I yell and he is tired of living with a ticking bomb. He is afraid I'll lose control and break something and that the neighbors will hear us arguing. Having such yelling once in half a year is too often for him.\n\nI asked how he prefers me to express my distress and he suggested that I just tell him exactly which actions I want him to do at that moment, or block the door without yelling. He refused to say which exact wording, maybe a code word should I use so that he understands my emotions, said there are millions of ways.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1698837281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17l9qg0/aita_for_yelling_at_my_boyfriend_over_a_dirty/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But it's hard to tease out from the entitlement that his father has shown him is his god given right.\n\nRead up on both ASD and ADHD and see whether this might fit him if he's never been diagnosed.  He may not want to know.  However a neurodiversity cannot be used as an excuse.  It may explain a few things but you use that explanation to develop strategies so that you aren't an entitled arse.\n\nReally, you've lived together for 18 months and things have gotten worse rather than better.  I'd give him one more chance to shape up and pull his weight or you either accept this is how it is and live with it... or you move on.

I don't mind cleaning, I don't mind cooking, the one thing I absolutely can not stand is having to deal with stuff before doing either. It takes 30 seconds to put clothes in a hamper after taking them off, it takes much longer to hunt for all the clothes not in the hamper. It doesn't take long to wash dishes, it takes much longer if you have to search for them first. He's not respecting that you get stressed because he's a lazy slob so he can deal with a bit of yelling because he's a lazy slob and stop being so dramatic about potential escalation.\n\nOr, and often this is suggested when communication and compromise might work, leave the lazy slob who wants to be a permanent victim rather than making choices to improve things. Your home stinks because he can't walk a plate to the kitchen.

I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been living with someone and they asked me to do something differently, so I did. Maybe not perfectly at first, but all I had to do was make a conscious effort to change that habit and boom, no more fighting. I\u2019m still me. I\u2019m tired of people using the whole, \u201cstop trying to change me\u201d bullshit excuse.
