Congratulations on your journey into parenthood.", "NTA, but I think you, your husband, and a lot of people here are grossly misinformed and uneducated about reproduction. I am saying this as someone who once had the same goals as you two, and honestly believes you are both incredibly lucky.\n\nMen constantly produce new sperm every day.  The overall quality can decline with age and health, but there is new sperm every day.\n\nWomen are born with a single set of eggs. They are not replenished and deteriorate over time.  Assuming the man's sperm is healthy, a primary cause of infertility and miscarriages in older woman is her egg quality.\n\nThe chances of a woman getting pregnant after 38 are much much much lower than many people realize, and it really tanks in your 40s.\n\nYou can do hormones and IVF to improve odds, but most fertility clinics have a cutoff age for IVF \u2013 you can not use your own eggs after 42 (ranges from 40-44, but 42 is common). Many will not work with you at all once you turn 45. If you want to get pregnant in your 40s, your realistic choices are freezing your own eggs now, or using someone else's (donor egg).  Even when doing hormones, IVF and frozen/donor eggs at 42, you are looking at a particularly low chance of pregnancy and an even lower chance of birth. We are talking about single digit odds here.  \n\nThere are only a handful of places that will harvest 42+ year old eggs, and a few that will do IVF with women 45+. These clinics do extensive embryonic testing to increase the odds of pregnancy and make it possible, but not probable, for pregnancy.  It is not impossible, but it is not very probable and incredibly expensive.\n\nSome women are incredibly lucky and can conceive naturally in their 40s.  A woman's body is absolutely able to carry a baby to term well into her 50s - but the odds of a woman being able to carry a baby to term from her own eggs at these later ages is just incredibly low.\n\nBased on all the \"Woman Can!!!!\" comments here, I expect downvotes.  The CDC tracks all the success rates for US fertility clinics (Assisted Reproduction Technology), and the information for every clinic is available by age and egg type.  There is also a tool that can help you estimate your chances of success.  https://www.cdc.gov/art/index.html", "YTA and apparently a tad immature. This should have been a discussion between the two of you and it seems premature to get his family involved after you only brought it up to him once. Also he's not wrong to take your age into consideration when having kids for the following reasons:\n\n* After 35 fertility rates decrease significantly which can be helped by IVF and fertility treatments, however these can be incredibly expensive and not guaranteed (most women after 45 can't get pregnant naturally, which again can be aided by expensive treatments).\n* After 40 a pregnancy is considered high risk and you will need to be constantly monitored by doctors for both you and your baby's health.\n* Fertility treatments that might be necessary after 40 increase the risk of premature birth and your age might cause increases in the risk of preeclampsia and stillbirth, but I want to stress that this is not a guarantee, just a possibility.\n* On average, it takes longer for women over 40 to get pregnant, so assuming you start trying at 40 it could be the next month but odds are higher that it will be in your mid 40's without medical intervention.\n\n[https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/having-a-baby-at-40#other-considerations](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/having-a-baby-at-40#other-considerations) \n\nOverall its more costly, risky, and uncertain to have children when the mother is over 40 so while he may have botched the delivery of his comment he's not wrong to realize that him waiting till his 40's to have kids means you will have to wait as well and thereby risk your and the baby's health to do so.
