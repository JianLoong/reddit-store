If No, then I would sit him down and call him out on this bullshit, because it could be he's feeling insecure about your new \"status\" and it's affecting his overall sanity.  And he needs a METAPHORICAL slap upside the head to quit it.  (NOt an actual one, metaphorical). \n\nIf however he constantly belittles your achievements, you should evaluate why you are with him. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYour husband is.", "Is this an isolated event - or a pattern with your husband? To belittle your efforts and achievements?\n\nIf the former, then point out to him how it hurt you. If the latter \u2026 well, do you think you can survive another 50+ years in this relationship?\n\nNTA , and, congratulations! Way to go!", "Thanks everyone for your comments. I am not going to let him ruin this moment  for me and I am using this as an opportunity to seriously reevaluate my life and make some changes.", "NTA- that\u2019s a big honour! He\u2019s really being the AH for not being supportive and really taking the joy out of your accomplishment. You are a lot more on the ball than he does, and he\u2019s clearly jealous.\nEnjoy your successes!", "WTF? Is he intentionally gaslighting you or just an AH? His disregard for your feelings is alarming... be on the lookout for other red flags. \n\nNTA", "NTA that dude's supposed to be your ultimate cheerleader and you get.... this? That's so sad OP I'm sorry.", "NTA at all. Husband sounds jealous you're finding joy in something and that's an asshole move. I hope you enjoy your graduation go through with the performance.", "NTA. He is, for being unsupportive and for gaslighting you to make you feel like you\u2019ve done something wrong. Even if something is going on with him and he can\u2019t be truly happy for you for whatever reason, he could still muster a \u201cgreat job\u201d if he had to. As your partner. As your person. As the friend he should be being to you, generally. Sounds like either he doesn\u2019t believe in your abilities or he\u2019s feeling insecure about something but either way, he\u2019s TA for making you feel like you\u2019ve done something wrong when HE dropped the ball in supporting you in one of the easiest ways possible. I\u2019m sorry. Either way, congrats!! So glad you went for it and were chosen \ud83e\udd29", "NTA.  He could have just said \"congrats\" and left it at that instead of trying to tear you down.  Even if he doesn't like your singing, telling you \"congrats\" is an appropriate response.", "NTA and that's a particularly callous response \n\nHow is your relationship otherwise?  Does he tear down everything else you do?", "NTA.\n\nWhat kind of spouse tells their partner that their big oportunities are first pointless and then not a big deal?", "NTA \u2014 Your husband is the AH. Congratulations on the graduation and for being selected to render the national anthem!", "NTA\n\nHE is making a big deal out of it!!!!  What is his point, other than trying to make you feel crappy?", "NTA.  Is he always this dismissive and shitty?", "NTA Wow. He\u2019s a bitter, jealous guy. Won\u2019t record you bc you\u2019re not good enough & rains on your parade when you make it. I think you should ask him why he\u2019s nothing but negative.", "NTA. As you said, it's a big accomplishment, opportunity and something you're passionate about. He's being rather rude by not being more excited for you. Is he always that short with you?", "NTA. He would be the AH even if he was just your friend, the fact that he's your _husband_ makes this so much worse. Like... He supposedly loves you, right? Why is he being so unsupportive and belittling? Bizarre.", "NTA.\n\nThere was no reason for him to react like that either way. In the first instance where you wanted him to record you, he could have said it in a much nicer way, like an, \"Oh, I don't really want to, sorry. Good luck though!\"\n\nAnd in the second instance, he could have at least said \"Well done\" or \"Congratulations\" - his response is honestly shocking to me since he is being so resentful about something you are passionate about. If this continues, consider alerting him that you feel he is blindly offending you.", "NTA.   \n\n\nAs my mom always says, we're supposed to be each other's champions, have each other's backs, it's a partnership.  Your husband doesn't sound as if he even cares about any of that.  He sounds like one of those people who takes others' triumphs as a mark against his own worth, rather than as inspiration.  \n\n\nI know this sub tends to go too quickly to \"DTMFA...\" but this guy doesn't sound as if he even likes you, let alone loves you.  Why are you still with him?", "Why would you possibly be an asshole for your feelings?\n\nINFO: is he jealous of your singing talent? Are you an aspiring pro \"wasting\" your time singing for free? I'm very puzzled by his reaction.", "NTA he sounds jealous of your accomplishments. And based on your response to another comment, I would assess your relationship....\n\nCongrats on graduating and being able to sing the national anthem! That's something to be very proud of!!!", "NTA. Is it your degree or your talent he\u2019s envious of, do you think?", "NTA-I hope he can learn to be more supportive.", "Nta, is he jealous of your achievement with your masters?", "NTA!! But your ex husband is the AH.", "Congratulations! That sounds exciting, I'm sure you'll smash it. Well done! X", "NTA. His response was awful and pathetic. You deserve better than this huge AH.", "NTA and congratulations! I\u2019m proud of you for going for it even in the face of doubt created by your husband. My ex husband did similar things to dim my light and it worked for a while. You deserve someone who is beaming with pride and telling everyone he sees how amazing you are. Or, you know, at least someone who doesn\u2019t actively try to hurt and belittle you.", "NTA. Not at all. You should be very proud of yourself - for completing your Masters, and for winning the opportunity to sing the national anthem. You rock! I\u2019m guessing your husband is jealous. Or a narcissist. Either way, you sound awesome, and if he doesn\u2019t support/appreciate you, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have no problem finding a man who will.", "NTA. if hes this mean and never supportive why are you with him", "Congratulations!!!! Getting your masters degree is a huge accomplishment. Bravo Zulu - well done. \n\nAs for the rest..... hubby is being an ass. You are not the AH.", "Absolutely NTA. \nAlso congratulations. And don't let your bitter man spoil this for you.", "NTA. What's wrong with him? This is something special, you should be congratulated. Is this typical for how he treats you?", "NTA.
