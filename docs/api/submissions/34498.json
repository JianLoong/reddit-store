That\u2019s first, last and security needed up front (and here 5k wouldn\u2019t touch those fees). Can you afford to move and buy on your own? (Depending on the area, you may overpay). Is, helping upgrade your living conditions and that of your in laws more than if you had to do it on your own? \n\nCan you afford the 1-3% increase in rent every year? Can you save while renting? Would you be able to cover all the unexpected and expected costs with homeownership?\n\nIf you need some perspective: our furnace broke and it cost $7k to get it replaced. Is that something you and your wife could afford on your own if you owned?  \n\n\nIdk if it\u2019s because I\u2019m a new mom but at 32 I feel like I keep wanting to scream at people to COUNT THEIR BLESSINGS.

I have a few different feelings on this one.\r  \n\r  \nFor one thing, $500 per month is no \"small\" discount. I call that a *significant* discount. And while a landlord asking a tenant to pay for home repair/upgrades may not be normal, neither is saving $18,000 on rent over those same 3 years you cited because your landlords are also your in-laws. You may want to consider that this whole \"not normal\" sword swings both ways (and on balance in your favor!) before you complain... lest your in-laws decide to just say \"OK, if you want 'normal', we're happy to oblige. We'll pay for all the home upgrades... and we'll also start charging you full-price\".\r  \n\r  \nWith that said... an unanticipated $1,000 is also no \"small\" expense, especially for a young family raising a child, and already stretched thin financially. While you're gaining from this whole arrangement overall, if we zoom in a little bit more, that still doesn't change the fact that being expected to suddenly cough up $1K on any given month with no warning isn't always easy, or even reasonable to expect. Rather than bite the hand that feeds, though: is there a way you & your wife could politely ask her parents for some advance notice of an upcoming intention to re-shingle the roof in the spring (or whatever)? This may not be an option if it's because something breaks, but I feel like most home renovation projects aren't done on a sudden whim. Having these expenses come less \"out of nowhere\" would mitigate some of the difficulty you're having with budgeting for them, and better enable you to spread the net discount you're still getting over time. A little communication goes a long way.", "YTA you are profiting from this arrangement", "Leaning towards YTA because the of the rental  discount adding up to 6K pa and $5,000 over 3 years isn't that much. You're still essentially 13K up.", "NTA. If you use her logic, her sister should pay half of all repairs her parents ask for. Sis is getting half the property when they pass, why should you and your wife cover her part of current repairs? If they had non related tenants in the house, would they charge them for repairs? No. You shouldn't be paying either.", "$500 a month is certainly not a small discount. YTA.", "Excuse me, but you say you're paying $500 a month less than the usual rent in your city.  That comes to $6K a year.  In my book, that is not \"a small discount,\" it's a very large and significant one.\n\nBut oh no, you're out 5K in terms of what your in-laws have asked for  on top of your rent to maintain both properties.  \n\nBy my calculations, that means you're still 13 thousand dollars ahead after three years, to your in-laws' detriment.\n\nIf you were paying a fair market rent, you could be put out by being asked for more.  But you're not paying fair market rent.  And you sound more than a tad ungrateful.\n\nNTA", "Everybody skipped over the \u201csmall child\u201d part and just went in on the \u201csmall discount\u201d. For those who don\u2019t know, children, no matter the age, are expensive. Another thing is that all OP said was that they pay $500 less than the average. For all we know their rent is $2500 vs $3000. \n\nFIL is asking for money to help upgrade the houses. Not for things like utilities. I stand by the if-it-ain\u2019t-broke-don\u2019t-fix-it philosophy. \n\nOP keep the money and use it for your kid and your own future house. Your wife is blinded by mommy and daddy completely ignoring the fact that she herself is a mommy. Anyway **NTA**", "$5000 is 10 mos of the discount, which isn't really a discount.\n\nHere the problem is that inheritance isn't guaranteed and neither children of owners nor tenants should be expected to pay to upgrade infrastructure", "YTA. You get $500 a month in savings, so $6K a year and you're bleating because you've had to cough up $5K out of $18K you've saved (whether you asked for it or not). And after that bit of math, do the people math. What's it worth to you to stay on good terms w/your wife and her parents. You're living in the sweet spot. Smarten up.", "Honestly, the math says YTA.   Try budgeting for the normal rent and setting the excess aside.  Pay for their stuff out of that money and you'll start feeling better as you see the balance grow.  Eventually that will be money for your house.", "If you save $500 a month, then the $5,000 you\u2019ve contributed is ten months of savings. Assuming you\u2019ve been living in the property for longer than ten months (and intend to keep doing so), you\u2019re coming out on top.\n\nIf it bothers you, you could always suggest to her parents that you pay market rates for rent in exchange for no longer contributing to property upgrades.\n\nOr ask to see a copy of the will showing that the property will be yours one day. M\n\nOr move.\n\nAlso keen to know if the sister contributes.\n\nNAH but some food for thought above.", "NTA", "So over the past 3 years you have saved $15000 on rent and spent an additional $5000 on upgrades half of which seem to directly benefit you since you live in one of the units. So overall savings of $10-12.5k. Yeah YTA.", "Then move out and pay market value for rent. Problem solved", "So, you\u2019ve saved approximately $18,000 over the last three years and coughed up around $5,000 to help pay for upgraded HVAC and insulation (which ultimately saves you money on the utilities), netting you $13,000+ in savings over the last three years.  \n\nI agree that the \u201cbut we\u2019ll inherit one day\u201d argument is irrelevant.  That\u2019s not guaranteed as much could change.  And if you weren\u2019t living in one of those houses at a reduced rental rate, you\u2019d have a very valid point.  \n\nBut you are living in one of the houses and your rental discount is costing them a full return on the property.  I wouldn\u2019t say Y T A for not wanting to pay for these expenses as most rents are determined to include such projected improvements and maintenance.  But you currently pay below average.  Kind of hard to see this as them taking advantage of you.", "That is a good way to look at it. I don't feel as bad now. Thanks", "FIL asks for money for home upgrades. How is OP TA?", "I love how OP uses the descriptor \"small\" twice. What a crock. Six grand a year is a big chunk of change, even in insane rental markets.", "Per month", "We didn't agree. Her dad will ask and she'll transfer the money in that moment. No previous discussions.\nWhen we own our house, I think her parents will be retired by then. The expectation is they would sell their properties and downgrade. We haven't talked much about that but it is a possibility that we may have to help out here and there but her parents should be able to support themselves after the downgrade.\n\nBut its not set in stone so I can't be 100% sure", "Your guess was at the mark. Unfortunately thats the market we're living in", "I don't think anyone here disagrees that children are expensive... but that doesn't change the fact that even $2,500/mo instead of $3,000/mo is still a steep discount. Most people with expensive children still have to rear them *without* the benefit of in-law landlords who are willing to knock almost 20% off the market price of their rent.\r  \n\r  \nKids or no kids, bottom line OP is still spending \\~$5,000 to save $18,000 over three years. I'll take that deal any day of the week! If we're really talking about *upgrading* stuff, just to make it nicer and fancier - as opposed to *replacing* stuff, because it's getting old and run-down - then I might not even necessarily disagree that it's maybe a little fishy for the in-laws who own 2 houses already to be hitting their cash-strapped kids up for financing on home improvements they don't want or need. But depending on the in-laws' disposition/personality, this might be one of those situations where you put that aside bc you don't really want to rock the boat and disrupt an arrangement that's a significant net benefit to OP's young family.\r  \n\r  \nOP, it sounds to me like the real issue here though is that you & wife just need to communicate better with your in-laws. They don't sound like unreasonable people. Can you ask them to *tell* you when they're planning on spending $ on the house a month or two out? If you're going to \"struggle\" to come up with $1,000 in a given month, can't you just tell them that? If you don't really *want* new bathroom tiles right now - and you'd rather put the money in the baby's college fund instead - can't that be something you just communicate openly with them about?", "So they should move and spend the extra 6k a year for rent? I mean I think that\u2019s stupid, but people are allowed to do stupid shit. Their child is not the grandparents responsibility and should not factor in at all. If I were the parents I\u2019d tell them to pay market value in rent and do the upgrades myself. The parents still come out better financially got it and op would lessen a valuable lesson. 6k a year is such a small discount, but then paying 5k over the course of three years is outrageous? Make it make sense", "Excellent thoughts but one of them turns out to be pointless, sadly. A will cam be changed the day after it\u2019s viewed by OP.", "thank u for being open to feedback, refreshing af \ud83e\udee1\n\nEdit: best of luck with your new home and family \ud83d\udc95 i hope the perfect place comes along soon \ud83d\ude4f", "Here\u2019s an easy solution - FIL should raise their rent by $500/month; then he could afford the upgrades himself. Is that better in your mind?", "I agree with his wife. These expenses are for the maintenance of the home(s) they live in. OP would prefer to be babied by his in-laws and not step up and contribute to their common benefit.", "So you get a $6000 discount per year. And you paid $5000 in additional cost over 3 years, so about $1670 per year. You're still getting a discount of over $4000 per year. This is you being petty and selfish.\n\nYTA", "Would you want to move into a cheaper place and pay the market rate? Perhaps even with this discount the rent is out of your budget.", "Absolutely, but worth a question. Do they know the intention is that they get the house, or is that an assumption?", "Doesn\u2019t even have to be the whole $500. Even $100 extra a month would cover the cost vs asking for a whole extra $1000 in one go which, for some odd reason, seems to be flying over people\u2019s heads. But what do I know.", "Perfect answer", "FIL asked for an extra $1000 on top of the rent. They have a kid. They\u2019re trying to save. It\u2019s not even a guarantee that they\u2019ll leave a house to each kid. They might just leave them both to the sister that\u2019s barely mentioned. I\u2019ve heard some shitty inheritance stories. If it\u2019s not an absolute necessity then it can wait.", "Nah he should charge them the full $500 since this dude is so ungrateful", "So you missed the part where her parents gift them $6000 per year in reduced rent? Do you think he is entitled to that?", "They could move out and spend the extra money somewhere else then. They have done this family a huge favor and have helped them save thousands.", "I wouldn\u2019t call it ungrateful. I\u2019d call it put upon.", "Didn\u2019t miss that. But you did miss the part that they have a small child. In this economy. Even before children were expensive and it\u2019s only gotten worse from the time we were children. \n\nAnother thing missed is that FIL basically asked for an *extra* $1000 on top of the rent. From people with a small child. Which I\u2019m guessing is between 1-4 years old. I\u2019d say no as well. But other people are different", "Nope, it\u2019s ungrateful. He feels entitled to a $500/month discount, but doesn\u2019t feel the need to help out with a fraction of what he\u2019s saving. He showed his true colors, no discount for him", "Wait, so because they have a child, her parents are supposed to subsidize their living expenses more than they already do? Do you have the same expectations for his parents?", "I feel like you need to look up the word \u201centitled\u201d. Also, the \u201cdiscount\u201d isn\u2019t for him. It\u2019s for his wife. But go off.", "It\u2019s not for the parents living expenses. FIL asked for the money for upgrades \ud83d\ude02 Not utilities or absolute necessities. Upgrades.", "He lives there and benefits from it as well, no?", "1) the discount is for both of them yes, they have shared finances\n\n2) his wife is fine contributing, because she understands that her father is doing them a favor, at his own expense and sacrifice, and is ok returning the favor when needed\n\n3) an entitled person, which he is, is someone like him that minimizes his FILs contribution to him - a \u201csmall discount\u201d he says, one which in a given year alone trumps the \u201cburdensome\u201d favor being asked of him in the span of 3 years", "You don't understand homeownership. Those upgrades to HVAC and insulation make a significant difference in power usage. These are investments that begin paying off immediately. \n\nIt's not like he's buying spinning hubcaps or a hot tub. \n\nTheir households are economically intertwined to the benefit of the young family. It is entirely reasonable to ask them to contribute for improvements. \n\nYour insistence that this is somehow unfair seems very immature.", "There\u2019s a difference between necessity and wanting. And if it\u2019s immature to say asking for, let\u2019s say $3500 rather than the agreed $2500 is unfair, then yes I am immature. Because it\u2019s not just the house that OP and his wife are occupying. It\u2019s for both houses. I said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: if it\u2019s not absolutely necessary it can wait."]}
