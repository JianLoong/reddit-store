Yesterday her mom texted me and asked what the passcode is, I texted back saying why does she want to know. She said that she wants to check who she is in contact with and what social media\u2019s she using, I told her that if our daughter isn\u2019t telling her then she shouldn\u2019t think that I will tell her because a kid deserves privacy, and I can easily check who she\u2019s in contact with when she visits me and if anything is wrong I\u2019ll tell her. \n\nWell she told me that we need to know as soon as possible and that she could be foolish and put herself in danger within the time that she is at her place, (our daughter is at her mom\u2019s for 4 days but I do see her in those 4 days because her school is close enough to my work and I sometimes pick her up to go to cafes or parks for an hour or two before her mother picks her up) I said \u201ci can check her phone even on days you have her because it\u2019s on school days\u201d she got frustrated told me that she has the right to know and hung up, I asked my daughter if she even wants her mother to know her passcode and she said she doesn\u2019t know but she wants her phone to be hers only and less people knowing is better. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1694895869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kh3dy/aita_for_not_telling_my_daughters_phone_password/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because you bought the phone doesn\u2019t mean you get to make unilateral parenting decisions.  What if she did the same to you, \u201cI\u2019m the one who takes her to school, so I\u2019m moving her to a new school.\u201d  You wouldn\u2019t like that.", "YTA. A ten year old should not have unlimited privacy on a phone from either parent. You\u2019re just being an asshole to your ex. You should both have the ability to monitor what your kid is getting up to online. If I were your ex I\u2019d be taking the phone away while she\u2019s with her.\n\nYou need to learn to be an actual parent, not a friend. You also should have talked to her Mom and made a plan together for rules and boundaries before even buying the phone.", "YTA. You have no clue the predation that occurs online.  Your daughter does not have a right to phone privacy.  You and your ex wife both have a responsibility to monitor your child's messages and, btw, she's too young for social media.  Internet is the #1 means that traffickers use to seduce children, and trafficking is an epidemic around the world right now.  \n\nTrust me - as someone who works with these kids - you don't want to set up the dynamic that your daughter can play you and your wife against each other. You'd rather have a healthy daughter at home who is angry at you for monitoring her phone than a missing daughter being trafficked - or worse. And let your ex have the password.  Men and women bring different talents to parenting. Use this as a bridge to coparenting rather than a tool for control.", "YTA\n\nyour daughter is 10.

Wow.", "Ummmmm so your ex has to respect your 10 year old child\u2019s privacy but you can be the one who goes through her phone?!?!?\n\nYTA. Firstly your child is 10 yrs old! A very vulnerable age and your ex wanting to be able to check who is contacting her is actually the good parenting.\nWhy are you the only parent with authority to check her phone? I can only assume you have some sort of grudge against your ex.", "YTA. A 10 year old should NOT have that much privacy with a smart phone. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really understanding the dangers here. Frankly a 10 year old shouldn\u2019t have a smartphone at all.", "YTA a major AH.  She's ten years old and should be unsupervised on social media PERIOD.  You are also teaching your daughter she can play you and your ex off of each other. Epic parenting fail.", "I'm skeptical of this one.  A ten year old heavily into privacy?", "YTA\n\nIf you check her phone anyway, why shouldn\u2018t mom? Does your daughter know you will check her phone? Plus, she\u2018s 10, so you should definitely set boundaries and clearly communicate to her that her phone won\u2018t be \u201ejust her\u2018s\u201c, meaning you both will be keeping an eye on her activities.", "YTA and I can tell you\u2019re a lot of fun to coparent with. Your daughter is 10, which is too young for phone privacy. You\u2019re gatekeeping for your own enjoyment. Share the password.", "YTA. Dude. Seriously? You're completely out of touch here. She's ten. She's got poor judgement and naive about who she could be in contact with. Her mother is 100% right.    \nYTA.", "YTA. 10 is so young to have a smart phone, there are so many dangers out there, strangers have access to her, there's so much dangerous information out there and too many awful things to see. Her mom is absolutely right to check the phone, and it should be checked very regularly. You also really need to talk to your daughter about using the internet and social media, and how people out there don't always have the best of intentions.", "Actually after reading comments I definitely do take that back, YTA. I think after reading deeper there was definitely a lot of good points made about sexual predators being smart on the internet posing as children and your daughter is still 10. I think it would be definitely different if she had a flip phone or one that has disabled internet and has mainly texting and calling like I am used to and my kids had. Also, why should you get her phone password but her mom doesn\u2019t? If you have the ability to check her phone then why shouldn\u2019t her mom have any right to. Maybe her mom is seeing something that you are missing and is rightfully concerned.", "YTA. Both parents should have the passcode to a CHILD\u2019s phone. Quit being petty.", "YTA. There are ways to check your kids phone without completely destroying their privacy.", "YTA. \n\nThe kid is 10. So, first off, she shouldn\u2019t even have social media. \n\nSecondly, you absolutely should be monitoring her phone and internet usage. Because, you know, she\u2019s freaking 10!\n\nThirdly, you don\u2019t have the right to dictate how mom parents on her custody time. \n\nYou are giving your child entirely too much freedom with phone and internet use and access.

Privacy is great, but so is safety and kids are idiots.", "YTA. \n\nAt 10, having a diary no one reads is expected privacy. Having a phone that both parents can not monitor, NOT OKAY!\n\nThis is about you holding the power over of your ex. \n\nUnlimited online access without regular monitoring is unsafe for a 10yo, and if you don't feel this way, you have not been paying attention to the world.\n\nMy teens had random phone checks until graduation. At 15, my oldest had an online \"friend\" from the southern part of our state for multiple years prior. I had seen their messages for years, and they seemed completely innocent. They asked to stay the night out, so I did phone check prior. Saw concerning messages about a hotel room they would be at while in town visiting, and that was where they said they'd meet. Obviously, a teen can't rent hotel rooms. It seemed sketchy, and I gave the information to the SO, and guess what?! It was a 30yo man, no children.", "YTA. You and your ex should be regularly checking her phone for her safety. You should also sit her down and explain that there are evil people in the world that pray on children. Teach her internet safety and ban any apps that lets her talk to strangers.", "YTA Dumb dangerous petty power struggle. If I were the mom I\u2019d take the phone away for this foolishness.", "Yta. Parental controls exist for a reason and 10 year olds are stupid enough to NEED the supervision. Give her the password and set up a parental control account for you two to share. \n\nRespect her mother. I'm sure you'd want the same respect if the circumstances were reversed.", "Yta. You either go full privacy or no privacy. If you can check the phone so should mom.", "YTA, granted when I was 10 I had full privacy with my phone but when I was 10 my phone was a flip phone solely used for calls and texts. There was no social media back then. If you have the right to check your daughters phone why shouldn\u2019t her mother? Isn\u2019t it a good idea that you both monitor your daughter, and make sure that the things she may be looking at or posting or talking about are appropriate for her age. The internet isn\u2019t really made to be a friendly place for kids, the more you\u2019re both able to keep tabs on your daughters phone usage the more you can explain the things she sees and parent her in a way that will promote her mental health and physical safety in the long run.", "YTA. Step up dad.", "YTA your daughter is way too young to have any privacy online. She could be talking to anyone it's extremely unsafe.", "My mom and SD just took the phone my dad gave me and turned it off. That sucked. I would get it back when it was his weekend.", "YTA- A ten year old shouldn\u2019t have technology privacy right now. Would you drop her off alone in the middle of a busy city? That\u2019s basically the internet. Thankfully she has a mom who knows better and hopefully you will work together to set reasonable and safe technology boundaries and rules for her. Because right now you\u2019re being an absolute goober with this big into privacy nonsense.", "YTA \n\nDude I remember all the predators in my dm\u2019s as a 16 year old. I can only imagine how bad it is for a 10 year old\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the minimum age for social media is at least 13 if not higher on some apps. You\u2019re setting your child up to scar herself with unmonitored internet access like that", "YTA. honestly, at that age, her phone really should have parental controls, and I hope her mom installs those. also, there's a reason all social media platforms have a minimum age of 13 for being on it, she shouldn't be using any at all.", "Yta shes 10 and should not have unlimited privacy. And parents checking their kids phone is normal, what the mother is doing is completely fine.", "YTA. The fact that a 10 year old wants privacy shows she\u2019s doing something wrong. It may not be terrible. Maybe just talking to boys, but that could innocently lead into sneaking out of the house, sending inappropriate pics, etc. Your ex and you need to set some ground rules and enforce them together.", "YTA. I\u2019m not a parent so feel free to disregard my opinion, but 10 seems way too young to have unsupervised internet access. Especially these days, when there aren\u2019t a whole lot of kid-friendly online spaces. You and mom need to be aware of what your daughter is looking at and doing.", "YTA what the hell is wrong with you? She\u2019s 10. Does you know how easy it is for bad shit to happen? She has no right to privacy until she\u2019s old enough to have some common sense. She\u2019s 10. \n\nThis is a sick power play on your part over her mother trying to parent. That\u2019s enough to hit YTA alone.\n\nYour best (thought still losing argument) would be is that you\u2019ve put parental controls on her phone, have attached her tik Tok account to yours\u2026 but you were noticeably silent on that.", "YTA- she\u2019s 10. Both parents should know exactly what the daughter is using and approve any apps. She is not mature yet to make healthy social media/phone decisions", "YTA, yes privacy is good but 10 year olds can get into a lot of trouble without realizing, especially if she has social media at that age. People are creeps and know how to get trust from kids, especially kids her age, her mom should be allowed to check her phone sometimes since she is also the parent, ur not the only one.", "YTA you mostly sound like a hypocrite here. Like you're making it seem like if her mother peeked at her phone it's a huge privacy invasion but if you do it it's totally fine?", "soft YTA . as a queer teenager im usually pretty against parents having unlimited access to their kids phones for obvious reasons , and i think thats very nice that you respect your kid, but thats a 10 year old . please do not let a 10 year old on social media .", "YTA. This is a way someone can access your kid. Both parents need to be able to also monitor her on it. Give mom the code.", "YTA\n\nIgnoring the fact that unfettered access to everything an iPhone can hold is a terrible idea to give a ten-year-old, what's your issue with allowing your wife password access? This is her daughter as well, and by controlling that aspect of your child's life, you're preventing your wife from doing her best for your kid. You guys need to *co*parent, and that means sharing things in real time, not, \"I'll let her know if there's an issue.\"\n\nYour daughter is yearning for freedom which is normal and healthy. She has a sense of privacy related to personal belongings. Also good. But those are instincts that need to be honed and guided in a good direction. Handing her tech (the related dangers of which you're very dismissive) without continued direction could very well be setting her up to become the victim of an online predator.\n\nDon't turn the phone password into a powerplay with your wife. Password-sharing may not be the answer, but you both should have monitoring apps that are connected to her phone. That's not a situation that should last forever- as she shows herself to be smart, discerning, and responsible, those restrictions can be lifted, but my word...put them in place for her safety, it's going to be so much better for her than trying to catch the horse once it's out of the barn.", "YTA. You are on a power trip over your ex wife, and using parenting of your daughter as a weapon. You\u2019re a total AH.\n\nIt is a much better deterrent to your daughter doing anything \u201cnaughty\u201d if she knows both parents have the power to perform spot checks.  \n\nIf she\u2019s smart then she will just delete all unauthorised apps and problematic chats before she comes to your house and reinstall them to carry on disobeying rules while at mums house.\n\nThere is obviously a reason that she is withholding the passcode from her mum, and that is that she\u2019s doing something she isn\u2019t supposed to. You are enabling her.\n\nMy stepdaughter did this, resisted her father checking her phone and it turned out she had pictures of her private parts on there. We don\u2019t think she sent them anywhere, we believe that she took them out of curiosity of what she looked like down there and was embarrassed at the idea of dad seeing them. She was 8 at the time and not supposed to have anything but WhatsApp and FaceTime for family contact and Roblox on the device. She had TikTok without authorisation too. My partner had a good chat about issues like taking nudes and sending them, not knowing who you\u2019re speaking to etc. \n\nYou need to be well aware of what your kids are doing so you can hopefully safeguard them before they do something stupid.", "YTA I can\u2019t even get it thru my head how you even think that\u2019s okay. Also she\u2019s fucking 10 and there are creeps everywhere her phone usage and internet activities NEED TO BE SUPERVISED. The fact that you didn\u2019t think of the danger you can be putting her in is mind blowing.", "YTA your daughter is 10! Do you have any idea of how irresponsibility you're exposing her to predator", "YTA - my son knew we would randomly check his phone and did so until he was 16.\nIf I were your ex I would be confiscating the phone while she was at my house or make her leave it at yours.", "YTA. You\u2019re undermining the mother\u2019s authority.", "Yes, YTA. You\u2019re *both* her parents and you both need to be aware of what she\u2019s doing online. It\u2019s not up to your 10 year old to decide if her parents check her phone. She needs to know that either of you can check it at any time and that you\u2019re not doing it to spy on her but to keep her safe. At 10, she cannot possibly do that alone. \n\nQuit using the phone as a way to 1Up your ex. This has nothing to do with keeping your daughter\u2019s privacy; this is about lording it over your ex wife.

With your comment about her wanting her privacy I am guessing you do not check this at all.  You are setting up a very dangerous situation for your child.

It\u2019s simple and easy, his birthday, but we both have access and will have access as long as we deem necessary. I\u2019ve already had to limit things because we realized (yes, we should\u2019ve done it before, please don\u2019t come at me) that he was looking up things he shouldn\u2019t have, and we also need to know if he is trying to be in contact with people in some way that he shouldn\u2019t.\n\nOP, YTA simply because you should be prioritizing your child\u2019s safety and health over your opinion that she needs \u201cprivacy\u201d.

This item you\u2019ve given her is much more risky than anything we had growing up, I may be younger than you but even I never had the same access children these days have.

She stumbled across a lot of eating disorder/depression threads on apps like instagram, tumblr and that which eventually gave her a complex about her own weight, kids brains are like sponges at that age and absorb information like crazy. I think with her being the mother she should also be granted access to a point, but it should more so be a thing of \u201cI want to know who you\u2019re in contact with but I\u2019m not going to go through your private messages\u201d type of thing.

I think it\u2019s good that at a young age your daughter understands privacy and how to set boundaries for herself; however, there needs to be middle ground. You could talk to her together and ask her to open the phone (rather than opening it yourself, so she feels that her privacy hasn\u2019t been violated), so that she can show you what apps she uses. Explain how groomers operate, explain location services, scammers, etc. This is a great chance to teach her how to protect herself on the internet, because it\u2019s inevitable that she will use it one day even if you didn\u2019t get her this phone. You could also install security apps to monitor her activity as well from your own phones, so that she doesn\u2019t feel as violated if you are truly concerned about safety.

She is very young, and letting her access every social media, etc is dangerous.

I don't know if looking into that kind of things is something her mother would do, but if that's the case I say giving her full access to your daughter's phone is not a good thing to do. Some kind of parental lock on certain apps/websites, while letting her have her privacy in allowed apps (and explaining to her the reasons etc) would be something to consider?", "NTA- If mom wants access, she can buy her a new phone.

She said that she wants to check who she is in contact with and what social media\u2019s she using, I told her that if our daughter isn\u2019t telling her then she shouldn\u2019t think that I will tell her because a kid deserves privacy, and I can easily check who she\u2019s in contact with when she visits me and if anything is wrong I\u2019ll tell her. \n\nWell she told me that we need to know as soon as possible and that she could be foolish and put herself in danger within the time that she is at her place, (our daughter is at her mom\u2019s for 4 days but I do see her in those 4 days because her school is close enough to my work and I sometimes pick her up to go to cafes or parks for an hour or two before her mother picks her up) I said \u201ci can check her phone even on days you have her because it\u2019s on school days\u201d she got frustrated told me that she has the right to know and hung up, I asked my daughter if she even wants her mother to know her passcode and she said she doesn\u2019t know but she wants her phone to be hers only and less people knowing is better. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My rule (quite some time ago, so things are different), was only computers in common areas until late in high school and if they wanted to do social media they had to friend me.

The computer in a common area?  I had boys, yes it led to a discussion of porn (omg the things on youtube back then!)
