I was ultimately called NTA but I\u2019m truly happy for every judgement, the YTAs as well! \n\nReading through all of the comments was basically impossible, however there were some prominent ones. \n\nDue to so many recommendations I now have an appointment for an ADHD diagnosis which I am really happy about. I also used many comments as tips on how to get ahead of my schedule even more just in case I\u2019ll ever run late again. Thanks so much for that! \n\nHowever, long story short, here is how the situation turned out in the end:\n\nBrunch with my friends usually starts at 11am. I arrived at 11.15am so 15 minutes late. \nHowever one of my friends had an appointment at 1pm which lead to the brunch being pulled forward an hour, now starting at 10am. \nNow, here it gets a little confusing. \nUsually these things are simply posted on the group chat in advance, everyone reads it and all is good. \nNow the 10am brunch was planned at the brunch the week beforehand which I didn\u2019t attend due to an appointment. Now I was meeting up with one of them a day later and they where supposed to tell me about it. However, hanging out, they simply forgot about it. (No problem, happens to everyone yk) \nSO I was arriving to the 10am brunch at 11.15 and called that \u201ea little behind schedule\u201c which made them angry as it seemed really ignorant. That explains the huge reaction tbh. \nNow we all had a talk after a few days and it took about 5 minutes of confused discussion until they realized that they didn\u2019t tell me. They started apologising profusely immediately. \n\nTo sum it up we\u2019re all good now! It was a misunderstanding and that happens. \nNext brunch is fully on them lol \n\nThanks for everyone\u2019s judgement! Hope this update helps understanding the situation and isn\u2019t too confusing. (It was very confusing to write tbh)", "created_utc": 1681041325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ghcct/update_aita_for_being_late_when_i_was_previously/", "score": 356, "replies": ["So it wasn't 15 minutes but an hour and 15 minutes?\n\nThat explains a lot. I'm glad they realized that they fucked up.", "Yeeeah this still rubs me the wrong way. Getting up and wordlessly ditching you as a group is bullying behaviour. Ironic that it was their own mistake that has now wasted a bunch of everyone's time. Real friends would have a conversation about how your actions make them feel, not go all high school mean girl on you.", "Just read both your posts. It is a little confusing, with every little thing that could go wrong, going wrong. I'm glad everything is okay now, and glad you decided to get yourself tested for ADHD, because that first post of yours screamed to me \"timeblindness\", which is a common symptom for ADHD, among others.\n\nThere are a few subredits on here about ADHD that can really help in the time untill you get an official diagnosis. One that might help you (it helped me):\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ioi1my/i\\_went\\_through\\_700\\_reddit\\_comments\\_and\\_collected/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ioi1my/i_went_through_700_reddit_comments_and_collected/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nBut feel free to explore for yourself and see what might work best for you :-)", "[Original can be found here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125mtrh/aita_for_being_late_when_i_was_previously_someone/)", "I'm glad everything worked out for you! Your friends did seem really ready to go with that whole dramatically getting up from the table in front of you thing. I kinda feel like they've had that tee'd up for you and were waiting to use it. 30 seconds of convo between them would have revealed they didn't tell you the updated time.", "Personally, I would lose those friends. While it is nice they apologised, their behaviour is not acceptable.\n\nIf it started at 10 and you weren't there-- any one of them could have shouted you a *hey where are you?*. That would have led to a conversation where their failure to communicate the new time was apparent.\n\nInstead, they waited an hour without a word and without ordering, orchestrating the collective departure on their high horse with the express intention of humiliating you.\n\nWhen you texted that you were 15 mins late and on your way, anyone one of them could have let you know that you were *actually* over an hour late... and the conversation it could lead to would bring to light the issue of miscommunication.\n\nThere were better ways to resolve this (like sending you a message the day they made the change to avoid this in the first place), but their behaviour screams *mean girls* who talked themselves up and didn't give you the benefit of the doubt. Not one reached out in the hour + they waited? They just sat there, brewed in their discontent and then collectively froze you out. \n\nI'd thank them for the apology but seriously reconsider hanging out with them as a group... or even just go find a new group of friends who prioritise clear communication and avoid drama. You deserve better from those you call friends. \n\n(This is especially true if you turn out to be neurodivergent. We deserve good friends.)\n\nETA: And the fact that they didn't even get on with it, but wasted time and then went elsewhere despite the time constraint... what?? Make it make sense!?", "I agree, especially because it didn't affect them. It's not like they missed a flight or something.  They were eating at one place without OP, then made a huge fuss and ate at another place without OP.\n\nIf it's really that bad you stop inviting that person or stop waiting for them, you don't group bully.", "So wait...they sat there at the restaurant holding a table for an hour and 15 minutes, not eating anything, probably only drinking, then when you show up...they get up and leave and go somewhere else to eat? I'm sure their server really appreciated that!/s\nI'm sure they thought this was a great way to make a point, but a little conversation would have solved the problem and the server would have made a decent tip.\n\nUse your words people!", "They were able to sit for an hour and 15 mins and not order anything? I feel like waitstaff would have said something to them. I assumed they didn't order anything because you would have noticed empty plates and figured they were there for more than just 15 mins.", "Wow I still don't like your friends. Did they forget to use their one collective braincell that day? I'm assuming you texted that you were gonna be late after 1030 or so. And *none* of them remembered that plans for that day had been changed? When you had been consistently on time to most functions and didn't show up at 10, *none* of them thought to text you and ask where you were? They all sat there wasting time because they wanted to teach you a lesson despite you no longer being chronically late...they are serious assholes. \n\nI saw someone comment on the OG thread that it's possible that you have yet to shake this reputation. They genuinely haven't noticed that you've been on time to everything the last 2 years. If you want to continue these friendships, you should have a conversation with them about how you've worked hard these past 2 years to change and how disheartening it is to see that they basically gave up on you after one incident.", "They should have known better than to ask someone to pass the message when they could have simply drop you a text which takes 1 min? \n\nI have trust issues so I always make sure to check with whoever i\u2019m meeting the night before and again in the morning to ensure the time and place. It can be annoying but it always works and thankfully, friends have never once said i\u2019m being annoying. Also, me upping on that constant texting is also due to a guy ex-friend who told me he was \u201cleaving\u201d and made me wait AN HOUR. Yea, no thanks. I dropped him and are no longer friends.\n\nYou had no fault in this as most times if someone were late they usually send a message asking where they are and ask if they are okay etc.", "So instead of saying \u201c hey, where\u2019s op at?\u201d With each other after an hour of not being there yet, they didn\u2019t bother to you know, Text you? Yes, people can be late to meet up and if my friend is more then 20 minutes late, we would be texting, calling them every 5 minutes to make sure they\u2019re okay and keeping updated. What kinds of friends are those op.", "ADHD has NOTHING to do with being late. People are late because they chose to be late. It's REALLY easy to be on time everywhere. Stop throwing the ADHD everywhere omg", "Glad they realised they mucked up and apologised for it.", "I glad you all worked it out. I'm confused about brunch, isn't 10am technically still breakfast? Just asking\n\n\n\n\nEdited: just looked it up and apparently brunch can start at 10 and ends at 2. You learn something new every day.", "Yeah, their excuses are bull shit. OP these aren\u2019t good friends. They should have texted you when the time change was made and texted again once they realized you weren\u2019t there.", "10/10", "Or the fact that in all that time they were waiting, the friend that she met with never mentioned the fact that they never told op about the time change..", "me when i fundamentally dont understand what a mental illness is and i think its just a cute little internet buzzword", "\u201cTime blindness\u201d is related to executive functioning problems that come with ADHD, which is why many people with ADHD struggle with being on time. This is like telling a depressed person \u201cYou are unhappy because you choose to be, it\u2019s really easy to be happy\u201d. Educate yourself"]}
