I was ultimately called NTA but I\u2019m truly happy for every judgement, the YTAs as well! \n\nReading through all of the comments was basically impossible, however there were some prominent ones. \n\nDue to so many recommendations I now have an appointment for an ADHD diagnosis which I am really happy about. I also used many comments as tips on how to get ahead of my schedule even more just in case I\u2019ll ever run late again. Thanks so much for that! \n\nHowever, long story short, here is how the situation turned out in the end:\n\nBrunch with my friends usually starts at 11am. I arrived at 11.15am so 15 minutes late. \nHowever one of my friends had an appointment at 1pm which lead to the brunch being pulled forward an hour, now starting at 10am. \nNow, here it gets a little confusing. \nUsually these things are simply posted on the group chat in advance, everyone reads it and all is good. \nNow the 10am brunch was planned at the brunch the week beforehand which I didn\u2019t attend due to an appointment. Now I was meeting up with one of them a day later and they where supposed to tell me about it. However, hanging out, they simply forgot about it. (No problem, happens to everyone yk) \nSO I was arriving to the 10am brunch at 11.15 and called that \u201ea little behind schedule\u201c which made them angry as it seemed really ignorant. That explains the huge reaction tbh. \nNow we all had a talk after a few days and it took about 5 minutes of confused discussion until they realized that they didn\u2019t tell me. They started apologising profusely immediately. \n\nTo sum it up we\u2019re all good now! It was a misunderstanding and that happens. \nNext brunch is fully on them lol \n\nThanks for everyone\u2019s judgement! Hope this update helps understanding the situation and isn\u2019t too confusing.

While it is nice they apologised, their behaviour is not acceptable.\n\nIf it started at 10 and you weren't there, any one of them could have shouted you a **hey where are you?** text. That would have let the cat out of the bag re: miscommunication (i.e. *their* failure to communicate the change of plans.)\n\nInstead of reaching out, they waited for an hour without a word and without ordering, orchestrating their collective departure on their high horses, with the express intention of humiliating / hurting you.\n\nThen, when you texted that you were 15 mins late and on your way, any one of them could have responded to let you know that you were *actually* you were over an hour late...  that would lead to ????? and the inevitable reveal of *their* failure to communicate in the first place.\n\nThere were better ways to resolve this (e.g. like sending you a message the day they made the change to avoid this in the first place), but at every opportunity they had to avoid drama they instead clung to their angst.\n\nTheir behaviour screams *Mean Girls* who talked themselves up and didn't give you the benefit of the doubt (e.g. an accident? maybe you forgot the change---oh wait, they didn't tell you!!). Not a single one of them reached out in the 1h+ they waited? Not one friend amongst them sough to remedy the situation? Where is their respect for you and your friendship?\n\nThey just sat there from 10am, brewed in their discontent and then collectively froze you out.\n\nI'd thank them for the apology but seriously reconsider hanging out with them as a group, since that kind of hive mentality is toxic. Or better yet, find a new group of friends who prioritise clear communication and avoid drama. You deserve better from those you call friends. \n\n(This is especially true if you turn out to be neurodivergent. We deserve good friends.)\n\nETA: Also, the fact that they didn't even get on with it?? They instead wasted that extra hour only to go elsewhere at 11:20 despite the time constraint still being there?? What?? Make it make sense!? Even if they were inconsiderate towards you, the choice to be petty trumped just ordering and still enjoying their time in your absence. \n\nETA: Clarity", "I agree, especially because it didn't affect them.

I'm sure their server really appreciated that!/s\nI'm sure they thought this was a great way to make a point, but a little conversation would have solved the problem and the server would have made a decent tip.\n\nUse your words people!", "They were able to sit for an hour and 15 mins and not order anything? I feel like waitstaff would have said something to them. I assumed they didn't order anything because you would have noticed empty plates and figured they were there for more than just 15 mins.", "Wow I still don't like your friends. Did they forget to use their one collective braincell that day? I'm assuming you texted that you were gonna be late after 1030 or so. And *none* of them remembered that plans for that day had been changed? When you had been consistently on time to most functions and didn't show up at 10, *none* of them thought to text you and ask where you were? They all sat there wasting time because they wanted to teach you a lesson despite you no longer being chronically late...they are serious assholes. \n\nI saw someone comment on the OG thread that it's possible that you have yet to shake this reputation. They genuinely haven't noticed that you've been on time to everything the last 2 years.

It can be annoying but it always works and thankfully, friends have never once said i\u2019m being annoying. Also, me upping on that constant texting is also due to a guy ex-friend who told me he was \u201cleaving\u201d and made me wait AN HOUR. Yea, no thanks.

Educate yourself", "To be honest OP I think you should reconsider the friendship regardless. Arriving an hour late would've been a dick move, but they purposely sat there and refused to order until they showed up so they could punish you. Any normal group of people would've just started without you. None of this would've happened if they weren't so dramatic, and I'm not sure it's worth continuing a friendship with people who hold grudges for this long. They didn't even text you asking if you were on your way, they weren't concerned about you and for people who are supposed to like you they were very eager to turn on you the moment they thought you'd made a mistake.", "I still don\u2019t think these people are your friends.", "Honestly your friends suck. I would find new ones because they were super rude. They were rude to the restaurant and server when they took up a table without ordering for more than an hour.

We were meeting at 10\n\nYou: in the group chat it says 11\n\nThem: oh\u2026but we decided 10 at the last brunch\n\nYou: I wasn\u2019t at the last brunch\n\nThem: right! So sorry!! What can we order for you?\n\nYour friends are miserable and they have no regard for you. You\u2019re a 2 dimensional figure to them summed up to be \u201calways late\u201d.", "Oh hon, you deserve better friends. I never would have just organized a \"walkout\" on my friend  in the middle of the restaurant. And why did you say you saw on their instagram that they went somewhere else to eat after? Why go to a different place than the one they told you about? These are not real friends regardless. I would have told my friend why I had to get up and leave. Not just pull some \"if I'm not worth your time you're not worth mine\" bullshit.", "I\u2019m confused about why that stuff about the new start time wasn\u2019t in the original post?

Not super trusting of you as a narrator tbh.", "Your friends suck", "I'll still drop that group of friends. They intentionally omitted that you were an hour late when you sent that message. They were waiting for you to humiliate you once you come, that's not what real friends do, that is some bully shit.

I'm so sorry your friends did that to you when you really didn't deserve it.\n\nI'm currently waiting to be assessed for ADHD. In the past I really struggled with being late for things, and although I'm a bit better at being on time now, it's still a struggle that I push through because I care about my friends.

I think it's f'ed up", "This is it! Also how are they not messaging OP, after OP had texted saying they were running late, to tell OP that they had been there until 10am. \nIt all feels very calculated, and very mean spirited. \n\nI still firmly believe OP is not and has never been the asshole. \n\nNta for both posts.", "[removed]", "Seriously.

Edit: I even brought up the the parallel to depression, when people tell depressed people to \u201cjust try harder to be happy.\u201d\n\nI have a close friend who recently exploded her own personal issues with someone else in my direction over my lateness, which she\u2019d never mentioned having a problem with before.

They wasted a lot of their own time because they'd rather be petty than have a good time. A much more mature reaction would have been to text OP to not bother coming anymore because of how late she was running. Any communication on their part would have probably revealed that OP was not informed about the change of the time. I think it's also concerning that during 75 minutes not one person of that thought about that they changed the time from 11 to 10 and that OP could have either not be informed or have forgotten about that.

As it turns out, the friends themselves were at fault for not having communicated the change of plan with OP to begin with. It would be fair enough if they'd told OP the new time and OP still didn't get there on time on purpose, but that wasn't the case.

But\u2026 I have ADHD and it took seeing four professionals to get my diagnosis. The reason I sought it out more is the reasons the first three gave for not diagnosing me or giving me meds. \n\n-The first one said that my doing well in grade school was evidence I didn\u2019t have it. I pointed out that female presenting kids (I\u2019m gender fluid but AFAB.) tend to get overlooked and present differently than boys, and that it\u2019s only in the last decade that they\u2019ve noticed this. This professional agreed and said he\u2019s seen the studies. Then repeated his reasoning. \n\n-The second found out I\u2019m disabled and wasn\u2019t working at the time. \u201cIf you\u2019re not working, then why would I give you meds?\u201d In his mind, I only qualified for meds if it affected my work. \n\n-The third saw me for multiple sessions and actually did proper testing. He said that according to the tests, I had ADHD, the scores were there. But because I could stay sitting in my chair during the appointments, he wouldn\u2019t give me the diagnosis. I was 30 or so at the time. I\u2019ve learned how to sit still. Plus, that type of hyper physical activity isn\u2019t part of how I present. \n\n-The fourth took about 20 minutes, said that the meds would be a big part of confirming that I had it because when people without ADHD take the meds, it causes a far different reaction. People with ADHD are missing a neurotransmitter that \u201cnormal\u201d people have, which causes a sleepy brain. \n\nAlso key for me? The fourth one was female. \n\nThis is my experience. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ll experience it.

I work so hard to be on time and *no one notices*. But the second I\u2019m a tiny bit late, it\u2019s a thing. People joke with me about needing to tell me times 30 min to an hour before. I hate it, because it\u2019s never about that. I also hate afternoon or evening activities because then I can\u2019t do anything all day as if I start doing anything I\u2019ll somehow end up late.

When OP was finally late again they had the chance to dump their emotions out and went for it. \n\nTo me this might explain how they looked over the friend forgetting to tell OP?

Then it's time to get orders but instead they just sit there and wait. **For an hour.** Instead of thinking to contact you they just sit there. Then at all 11:15 you finally get there and they all walk out and leave.\n\n\nNo, like someone else said, I think it's far more likely they're lying. It was at 11 and they realized they shouldn't have walked out so they came up with this big lie to cover it up. \n\n\nEither way, whether it was a lie or not, it seems like you should steer clear of them.", "Great that you and your friends and good now but how does the friend that forgot to tell you realize it when you are really late.

I've been the friend who my friends \"forgot\" to update me about changes. I would advise you to reflect on these friendships and your role in this group dynamic.
