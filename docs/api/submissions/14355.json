I was ultimately called NTA but I\u2019m truly happy for every judgement, the YTAs as well! \n\nReading through all of the comments was basically impossible, however there were some prominent ones. \n\nDue to so many recommendations I now have an appointment for an ADHD diagnosis which I am really happy about. I also used many comments as tips on how to get ahead of my schedule even more just in case I\u2019ll ever run late again. Thanks so much for that! \n\nHowever, long story short, here is how the situation turned out in the end:\n\nBrunch with my friends usually starts at 11am. I arrived at 11.15am so 15 minutes late. \nHowever one of my friends had an appointment at 1pm which lead to the brunch being pulled forward an hour, now starting at 10am. \nNow, here it gets a little confusing. \nUsually these things are simply posted on the group chat in advance, everyone reads it and all is good. \nNow the 10am brunch was planned at the brunch the week beforehand which I didn\u2019t attend due to an appointment. Now I was meeting up with one of them a day later and they where supposed to tell me about it. However, hanging out, they simply forgot about it. (No problem, happens to everyone yk) \nSO I was arriving to the 10am brunch at 11.15 and called that \u201ea little behind schedule\u201c which made them angry as it seemed really ignorant. That explains the huge reaction tbh. \nNow we all had a talk after a few days and it took about 5 minutes of confused discussion until they realized that they didn\u2019t tell me. They started apologising profusely immediately. \n\nTo sum it up we\u2019re all good now! It was a misunderstanding and that happens. \nNext brunch is fully on them lol \n\nThanks for everyone\u2019s judgement! Hope this update helps understanding the situation and isn\u2019t too confusing.

I'm glad they realized that they fucked up.", "Yeeeah this still rubs me the wrong way. Getting up and wordlessly ditching you as a group is bullying behaviour. Ironic that it was their own mistake that has now wasted a bunch of everyone's time. Real friends would have a conversation about how your actions make them feel, not go all high school mean girl on you.", "Just read both your posts. It is a little confusing, with every little thing that could go wrong, going wrong. I'm glad everything is okay now, and glad you decided to get yourself tested for ADHD, because that first post of yours screamed to me \"timeblindness\", which is a common symptom for ADHD, among others.\n\nThere are a few subredits on here about ADHD that can really help in the time untill you get an official diagnosis. One that might help you (it helped me):\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ioi1my/i\\_went\\_through\\_700\\_reddit\\_comments\\_and\\_collected/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ioi1my/i_went_through_700_reddit_comments_and_collected/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nBut feel free to explore for yourself and see what might work best for you :-)", "[Original can be found here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125mtrh/aita_for_being_late_when_i_was_previously_someone/)", "I'm glad everything worked out for you! Your friends did seem really ready to go with that whole dramatically getting up from the table in front of you thing. I kinda feel like they've had that tee'd up for you and were waiting to use it. 30 seconds of convo between them would have revealed they didn't tell you the updated time.", "Personally, I would lose those friends. While it is nice they apologised, their behaviour is not acceptable.\n\nIf it started at 10 and you weren't there-- any one of them could have shouted you a *hey where are you?*. That would have led to a conversation where their failure to communicate the new time was apparent.\n\nInstead, they waited an hour without a word and without ordering, orchestrating the collective departure on their high horse with the express intention of humiliating you.\n\nWhen you texted that you were 15 mins late and on your way, anyone one of them could have let you know that you were *actually* over an hour late... and the conversation it could lead to would bring to light the issue of miscommunication.\n\nThere were better ways to resolve this, but their behaviour screams *mean girls* who talked themselves up and didn't give you the benefit of the doubt. Not one reached out in the hour + they waited? They just sat there, brewed in their discontent and then collectively froze you out. \n\nI'd thank them for the apology but seriously reconsider hanging out with them as a group... or even just go find a new group of friends who prioritise clear communication and avoid drama. You deserve better from those you call friends. \n\n(This is especially true if you turn out to be neurodivergent. We deserve good friends.)\n\nETA: And the fact that they didn't even get on with it, but wasted time and then went elsewhere despite the time constraint... what?? Make it make sense!?", "I agree, especially because it didn't affect them. It's not like they missed a flight or something.  They were eating at one place without OP, then made a huge fuss and ate at another place without OP.\n\nIf it's really that bad you stop inviting that person or stop waiting for them, you don't group bully."]}
