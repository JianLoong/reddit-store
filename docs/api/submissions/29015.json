We established before we ever got engaged that if we were to be married, that we would have a Jewish ceremony\u2014not necessarily in a synagogue, but by a rabbi.\n\nMy parents are devoutly Catholic and I had not told them we planned on getting married by a rabbi yet. But, when my fianc\u00e9 asked for their blessing, my parents mentioned that as long as we are both in agreement (with decisions regarding religion) they just want us to be happy and make those decisions for ourselves. \n\nIt slipped from my FMIL in text that we were planning on getting married by a rabbi. My parents and I had a phone call where they asked \u201cjust give us a straight forward answer\u201d because catholicism is so big to them. I told them I was not interested in involving Christian elements in the ceremony. My mom went silent and I could just hear her sniffling. Conversation ended with how that is a tough pill to swallow and they need time to process. \n\nAnother call today and my mom started the conversation with how she\u2019s been crying about this the past three days (she has since apologized for starting the conversation that way.) They explained they want me to involve my catholic past in the ceremony by  including catholic wedding \u201ctraditions.\u201d I was confused by what they were saying, because I had told them the other day I had no interest in including Christianity in the wedding. They also asked, if the roles were reversed, how would my fianc\u00e9 and his family be handling this, because my parents feel left out (ostracized?) in a way. They think including Christian elements would showing the joining of both families. I asked them if they want me to do it for myself or for everyone else in my family, and they said to do it for everyone else. The conversation ended with them saying how they just want us to be happy and that they just want us to talk to a rabbi about including some traditional catholic wedding vows/scripture/etc. I basically broke down at that point. I told them I needed to process everything because  they \u201cjust want us to be happy\u201d but they\u2019re pushing me to do something for the sake of everyone else.

Particularly if anyone on either side is notably devout.  The options generally are (1) pick one tradition, and go with it (2) have two ceremonies, one in each tradition, or (3) just have a secular civil ceremony. \n\nTrying to combine the two, if there are family members who are truly devout, is asking for trouble.  The same theological claim can be an essential truth for one, and absolute sacrilege for the other.  E.g., an mention of Jesus being divine would be profoundly wrong in a Jewish ceremony, and absolutely essential in a Catholic one.

Mom and dad and auntie and uncle and cousins are there by proxy.

There is no religion for you to be isolated from. \n\nI\u2019m gonna be honest with you: nip it in the bud now, or it will never stop. Mom is gonna kick up a fuss because future kids won\u2019t be baptized, and won\u2019t have godparents, and won\u2019t be saved by Jesus Christ.

Omit the hardcore elements such as communion, and see about incorporating the Rite of Peace, in which the celebrants express to each other their desire for love and peace amongst them. I think a rabbi might see a way to incorporate this portion, which in my experience was the best part of mass anyway. In this part of the liturgy every attendee shakes hands or embraces the people seated around them in all directions and says \u201cpeace be with you.\u201d  It\u2019s a lovely sentiment in a setting like this, and necessary more than ever given the recent news.\n\nPerhaps you could also explore with a more permissive rabbi whether to incorporate the Canon of the Mass, which mentions God and his place within the congregation and the individual but without mention of the triple-person aspect of god or Jesus.

It's a sad test of whether they put their religion above their love of their daughter.\n\nJust quietly, whilst I haven't given any thought to the type of wedding I'd have (it's a bit cross-that-bridge) it would most likely be secular. Your post is making me think of my own parents and the likelihood they'd react the same way as yours. There would definitely be much wailing and gnashing of teeth. And even in that scenario, with my own family, I'd still hold my ground. \"Sorry you feel this way, but it's my day\".", "Your NTA, but a suggestion. We are atheists and decided to not have a religious wedding for our personal reasons but my religious family was very unhappy. So I offered that one of them could say a prayer before dinner at the reception. Maybe they would feel mire heard/represented if they got to say a prayer at the reception if you don't want it in the actual wedding? Otherwise, it's your wedding. Do what makes the two of you happy.", "NTA. Look, it depends what your relationship with your parents is otherwise like, but it sounds to me like they are feeling a little excluded from the wedding, and as much as the wedding is \"your\" day, it is also a celebration by the family. In a sense, they are the 'christian elements' of your wedding, so when you told them you aren't interested in involving christian elements, I think they took it as you aren't interested in involving them. And they are kinda correct. If the wedding is all Jewish ceremonies, then your husbands side of the family are going to be far more involved and invested on the wedding day itself, whereas your parents are going to feel more like bystanders as they won't know what is going on or the significance of it. Maybe instead of making the blanket statement \"jewish wedding\", have a conversation with your parents about the specific elements of the wedding and their explicit involvement and meaning, and they might come around (e.g. \"Instead of having Dad walk me down the aisle, in jewish tradition both parents walk me down the aisle, and I really like that idea because both of you mean so much to me, and so I would really like it if both of you walked me down the aisle.\"", "NTA, but you are performing religion for the sake of form to one family only. This probably makes your parents feel slighted. Hopefully they get over it soon.\n\nNot being religious is a healthy choice.\n\nI am surprised lack of faith does not matter to the religious authorities performing religious rites, but I guess they are more concerned about keeping numbers in congregations and finances from that.", "NTA\n\u201cWe just want you to be happy.\u201d\nThen why are you pressuring me to do something I already said I don\u2019t want to do?\n\nEdited typo", "Don't give in to manipulation. It sets a bad precedent. Tell your mom to get a hobby.", "Whether or not you want to include elements to reflect both of your families is up to you. Some couples view their wedding ceremony as a moment of joining/representing their families that\u2019s great. Some couples view their wedding ceremony as a moment to reflect and represent the parts of themselves they hold most dearly and that\u2019s great too. Whatever makes the two of you happiest is the right choice. \n\nYour parents have the right to ask and the right to not love the answer, but that\u2019s the end of their rights here. They should not be pestering and begging and manipulating you about including elements of a religion you don\u2019t even follow anymore in your wedding. As far as \u201cwhat if it was reversed,\u201d Judaism is an ethnoreligion with cultural relevance outside of actual belief/etc. Christians have a really hard time understanding that because there is - literally by design - no analog in Christianity. \n\nNTA.", "Do neither and have a Celtic Handfasting.  You can make that anything you want, incorporate anything you want.  Just understand, you\u2019re telling your side of the family \u201cfuck you\u201d middle finger and all.  Sure, it\u2019s your wedding, but there\u2019s the rest of your lives after that one relatively insignificant day (compared to many events coming).", "When they say \"We just want you to be happy\" I can't help but think that what they REALLY mean is that they won't let you be happy until you give them the Catholic wedding that they really want.  NTA", "Yes, exactly. Catholicism is not a culture or ethnicity Judaism is both as well as a religion.", "Sadly I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that easy. This is a tricky situation. Someone in this group is going to end up with hurt feelings and resentment no matter what happens I don\u2019t envy this bride.", "I think this is a pretty balanced take but I disagree with your final judgement. OP\u2019s mom is definitely an asshole. She\u2019s trying to insert her own religion into her daughter\u2019s wedding which isn\u2019t okay. And then on top of that she\u2019s trying to make OP feel bad for her own choices", "Not just wrong: a violation of a cardinal sin and a complete repudiation of our primary beliefs. The belief that Jesus is divine is why Judaism considers Christianity to be idolatrous, where Islam is not. Asking a monotheist to commit idol worship is not okay - there\u2019s a reason so many died rather than accept the cross.", "I have a question, maybe you can answer it for me. the fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t practicing the Jewish faith,  would many  rabbis be  ok performing a religious ceremony for someone not practicing the religion?  I think it\u2019s a lot of drama, when religion doesn\u2019t seem to play a big part  in their lives. Maybe religion should be completely removed from ceremony and then cultural significant things from both families can be part of the reception", "The Rabbi is essentially marrying a Christian and a Jew.", "Yeah, no. With this kind of thing, it\u2019s not gonna stop at the wedding if she gives in and stomachs it. ***Especially*** if they have kids. A Catholic grandma who uses tears to get her child to bend to her wishes is gonna be hell when she realizes that a jewish grandchild won\u2019t be baptized.", "Yes it is for the family, and by getting married they are a family, the two of them!", "Yeah, if mom starts phone calls saying how much she's been crying as a way to strong arm daughter into getting her way, she's absolutely the kind of person who will take a mile when you give her an inch.", "Have you been to both? I have and they are not similar at all. What traditions are you thinking are similar?\n\nOP you are NTA for your feelings and wanting things to be a certain way. Do what makes YOU and your future HUSBAND happy.", "Well said.", "Ehhh, I disagree as an atheist that was raised Catholic who still identifies as culturally Catholic. There is very much a culture consisting of unique customs and social norms that are unique to catholic communities. \n\nEthnicity does not equal culture!", "There is definitely a Catholic culture. What an ignorant take.", "Fellow Jew? I love your replies. Short and sweet and informative. :) I tend to be long winded in my responses when talking about Judaism.", "Catholicism might not be a \"culture\"....\n\nbut sometimes they do lean a bit into the cult part.\n\n/s", "Jumping on the Catholicism is a culture train... It is very much a culture.", "Her daughter is getting married in a religious ceremony that her daughter isn't part of. Yet telling mom nothing of her own background is allowed at her wedding. That's the daughter's choice, but it feels very unbalanced.\n\nThey could have a wedding closer to secular with nods to both Judaism and Catholicism involved. And such a wedding would be closer to who they really are as a joined couple. You don't have to use the Catholic creed, etc.", "Judaism is an ethnoreligion. The husband is still very much Jewish whether he practices more religiously or not. Judaism predates the ideas of what a \"religion\" is so it's confusing for non-Jews to understand that a cultural Jew is still very much a Jew (an atheist Jew like my sister is also still very much a Jew and a rabbi would happily marry her to someone). It's less confusing in a way if you think of us as a tribe with a religion. So yes, a rabbi would probably still be comfortable with marrying him (though it varies a bit by stream - Orthodox rabbis would be less so, Reform rabbis would be fine with it). \n\nOur cultural stuff and religious stuff is also very intertwined. The husband-to-be might for example still celebrate all the holidays but simply doesn't keep Kosher or go to synagogue often. He might consider that to be his \"cultural\" way of being Jewish. It's very much a mixed bag of what someone considers cultural vs. religious. Hope this makes at least some sense. I understand how confusing it can be for non-Jews to understand.", "Agreeing that Judaism is an ethnoreligion. In fact, the concept of the Jewish people pre-exists the both the modern idea of \"ethnicity\" and the culturally Christian concept of \"God\" in a way that a number of academic scholars have talked about in more detail but in short the ethnicity/religion divide is itself a product of the Christian specifically Paul-influenced era and Jews do not fit easily into the current culture as a result.\n\nThis is why I dislike it when Judaism is referred to as a \"faith.\" Most religious scholars understand Judaism is closer to Shintoism and many Native American religions in that it is focused on peoplehood over a belief system while Christianity and Islam are both \"faiths.\" Hope that helps!", "And not all rabbis are comfortable with that. At my shul, one of the rabbis does interfaith couples but only if it is a traditional Jewish ceremony in the sense that no one is trying to do communion (which I learned happens at a Catholic wedding when I went to my friend's very Catholic wedding) or anything like that. The other main rabbi does not. I just brought it up because if this couple is going to be married by a rabbi they should know rabbis can have boundaries about what kind of wedding they want to perform when it comes to interfaith couples. And this is coming from someone who grew up in a shul who did same-sex couple marriages since the 90s.", "I have - and combinations of both and everything in between. Like I said, I think OP should have the wedding they want but it might be worth at least seeing what their mom is actually referring to.", "Yeah, I would say that I grew up culturally Catholic and my daughter is growing up culturally catholic, although we're not religiously catholic.", "Yeah I agree. I would call myself culturally Catholic even though I'm no longer practicing.", "Yes but it's based in religion where being Jewish is even PRE catholisism. Jews have been persecuted for race and culture not just religion. There's a big difference. Catholisism is a choice, that culture is a choice, being born Jewish is NOT a choice... and telling people that wanting to honor biological culture,  the skin they wear through generics that your religious culture is just as important as their inherent biological culture seems incredibly insensitive and racist.", "Definitely a Catholic culture.  Definitely up to OP if they still consider themselves (or ever really considered themselves) part of said culture.", "Haha, yes and thanks! It\u2019s highly edited because I absolutely could write a whole lecture but then I feel like no one would read it. Short and to the point is usually more effective for me, at least on Reddit.", "But that's not what the couple being married want to do. OP is not a Catholic and does not want any Catholic elements in her wedding. She's allowed to want that, and to do that. There are other ways to bring in her family's traditions and identity that aren't religious. \n\nMom laying a repeat guilt trip (sniff sniff I've been crying and crying and crying) is an AH move. \n\nNTA, OP, have the wedding you want.", "Interesting thanks for the info", "Communion is straight up a form of idolatry in Jewish law, so I doubt many Rabbis would be comfortable involving themselves with it. I\u2019ve usually heard of it happening only when there\u2019s both a priest and a Rabbi involved.", "There is no \u201cbiological culture\u201d. Being Jewish is an ethnicity and that is biological, but that is not the same as a culture - can Judaism also is. These are not interchangeable terms.", "Yeah I need to practice that. Someone here asked if a rabbi would be ok marrying them due to the husband-to-be not being religious only cultural and my reply was 2 paragraphs long explaining \"yes.\"", "To add: We\u2019re matrilineal* so descent from a line of Jewish women is enough. I once met a lovely lady who\u2019s family were devout Catholics for many generations. But she was descended through a straight line of women from a Jewish woman, so was still Jewish. She was rather surprised, though I don\u2019t believe it effected her beliefs in any way. Her children were Jewish too.\n\n*Mostly. A handful of sects accept patrilineal if certain conditions are met. EVERYONE accepts matrilineal.", "Exactly! That's why I am skeptical about a rabbi who is willing to marry an interfaith couple would want to incorporate Catholic rituals into a wedding they were officiating and that's specifically why I brought it up."]}
