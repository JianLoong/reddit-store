We established before we ever got engaged that if we were to be married, that we would have a Jewish ceremony\u2014not necessarily in a synagogue, but by a rabbi.\n\nMy parents are devoutly Catholic and I had not told them we planned on getting married by a rabbi yet.

My parents and I had a phone call where they asked \u201cjust give us a straight forward answer\u201d because catholicism is so big to them. I told them I was not interested in involving Christian elements in the ceremony. My mom went silent and I could just hear her sniffling. Conversation ended with how that is a tough pill to swallow and they need time to process. \n\nAnother call today and my mom started the conversation with how she\u2019s been crying about this the past three days (she has since apologized for starting the conversation that way.) They explained they want me to involve my catholic past in the ceremony by  including catholic wedding \u201ctraditions.\u201d I was confused by what they were saying, because I had told them the other day I had no interest in including Christianity in the wedding.

They think including Christian elements would showing the joining of both families. I asked them if they want me to do it for myself or for everyone else in my family, and they said to do it for everyone else. The conversation ended with them saying how they just want us to be happy and that they just want us to talk to a rabbi about including some traditional catholic wedding vows/scripture/etc. I basically broke down at that point. I told them I needed to process everything because  they \u201cjust want us to be happy\u201d but they\u2019re pushing me to do something for the sake of everyone else.

Particularly if anyone on either side is notably devout.  The options generally are (1) pick one tradition, and go with it (2) have two ceremonies, one in each tradition, or (3) just have a secular civil ceremony. \n\nTrying to combine the two, if there are family members who are truly devout, is asking for trouble.  The same theological claim can be an essential truth for one, and absolute sacrilege for the other.  E.g., an mention of Jesus being divine would be profoundly wrong in a Jewish ceremony, and absolutely essential in a Catholic one.  You can't even make it through the second sentence of the Catholic Nicene Creed without pushing a devout Jew into something they absolutely believe is wrong.

Because of this, I have had to have a tough discussion with her and the rest of my family that I am no longer aligning myself with the church, and will not take any suggestions on what \u201cfaith based\u201d work I can do with my future career.

Mom and dad and auntie and uncle and cousins are there by proxy. And you\u2019re not having this be a Jewish wedding for your MIL or FIL, but because your husband\u2019s culture is important to him, so it is important to you that you do not isolate him from his religion. There is no religion for you to be isolated from. \n\nI\u2019m gonna be honest with you: nip it in the bud now, or it will never stop. Mom is gonna kick up a fuss because future kids won\u2019t be baptized, and won\u2019t have godparents, and won\u2019t be saved by Jesus Christ.

Omit the hardcore elements such as communion, and see about incorporating the Rite of Peace, in which the celebrants express to each other their desire for love and peace amongst them. I think a rabbi might see a way to incorporate this portion, which in my experience was the best part of mass anyway. In this part of the liturgy every attendee shakes hands or embraces the people seated around them in all directions and says \u201cpeace be with you.\u201d  It\u2019s a lovely sentiment in a setting like this, and necessary more than ever given the recent news.\n\nPerhaps you could also explore with a more permissive rabbi whether to incorporate the Canon of the Mass, which mentions God and his place within the congregation and the individual but without mention of the triple-person aspect of god or Jesus.

Maybe instead of making the blanket statement \"jewish wedding\", have a conversation with your parents about the specific elements of the wedding and their explicit involvement and meaning, and they might come around (e.g. \"Instead of having Dad walk me down the aisle, in jewish tradition both parents walk me down the aisle, and I really like that idea because both of you mean so much to me, and so I would really like it if both of you walked me down the aisle.\"", "NTA, but you are performing religion for the sake of form to one family only.

For the sake of your kids, you, and your STB husband.", "Yeah I can kind of understand where her parents are coming from - if they know that both of the couple are non-religious it\u2019s a little fair in some ways for her parents to feel hurt that instead of a secular wedding they\u2019ve chosen to include one family\u2019s religious beliefs that they don\u2019t even believe in. It\u2019s a very clear statement that their religious beliefs mean much less to their daughter and her fianc\u00e9 than his parents\u2019 do and they had to find that out from their future son in law\u2019s mother rather than their own daughter.", "No. Weddings are about the couple getting married. That's who the wedding is for. They can get married all alone with no one else there, and they're still married. (Some of the happiest couples I know eloped and got married at a courthouse away from all of this stuff.)\n\nFamily is invited as a courtesy, and it's better to have them there if possible - but if they're going to try to impose their will over that of the only two people whose opinions really matter (the couple) then they can sit it out.", "Ever heard of Christmas or Eastern? \n\nThe fact is that Christian culture is so much part of everyday life for most people in Western countries that it is hardly perceived as such anymore.\n\nHere you can definitely leave the church and no longer believe in God.

LOL come on.", "The Irish would definitely disagree about the cultural part.", "Say that in Ireland\u2026", "Judaism is only a religion", "Curious as to how you come by this idea.", "(I say \"communities\" because, at least where I am, this program is a joint effort between the Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist shuls to expose their students to a wide variety of viewpoints and practices, which I love.)", "My husband is not religious, but is Jewish, and I was raised Catholic (also not currently religious).  We were married in a Jewish ceremony by a rabbi, so yes, some rabbis will definitely do this.  It\u2019s common enough that you can by a multi-faith Ketubah these days as well.", "Tell someone who grew up in Northern Ireland that Catholic isn't a culture and see how far you get...", "Catholics didn't murder millions over centuries and amass trillions in stolen wealth to not be considered a culture unto itself.", "Practicing Catholic, here. And totally agree with you.", "I grew up surrounded by Christianity, specially Catholics. Jewish culture is incredibly different and IMO all the Catholics saying otherwise are ignorant to what Jewish culture is. Which is honestly very typical and something I\u2019ve encountered my whole life.", "[deleted]", "Right, because the culture there is Irish. Not Catholicism.", "Where being Irish is the culture? Sure.", "LMAO, tell that to my DNA. I\u2019m literally 88% ethnically Jewish. You\u2019re incredibly ignorant.", "I can't imagine any Rabbi being ok with Communion being performed at a ceremony they are officiating.

Not where I came from. You are either catholic or a pagan there.\n\nAnd I can't remember somebody asked my opinion when I was baptized as a baby.", "It's not true that Catholicism is a purely religious culture. Maybe it feels that way where you are, but if you grew up in a sectarian place you know that being identified as \"Catholic\" can have nothing to do with religion. My entire family is atheist and I despise the Catholic church, but we are still considered culturally Catholic in the eyes of our country, and knowing that we will be perceived as such is important. I can tell people I'm culturally Catholic and convey a lot of information about my politics, cultural references, background & even language without saying anything about my belief in God. I'm not saying its 1:1 with Judaism which obviously has its own complicated history, but it's certainly a lot more than pure religion.", "So have Catholics, have you never heard of the Troubles?", "Deleted because I was wrong. Sorry!", "But they are cultural. Our European background is where we get our traditions. Our traditions are based off religion. Making it a cultural tradition.", "Cultural Catholicism/Protestantism is a key defining characteristic of one ethnocentric block over another.

Not true with catholics", "I\u2019ve got Ashkenazi DNA, I\u2019m an atheist, but my mothers parents did incorporate the familial and social spirit of Shabbat as a way of reinforcing how important it is for everyone to take the time to unwind with family and friends.

We were raised vaguely Reform, but she's the only one that still practices.\nFunny enough, my husband's Catholic priest was very open to our mish-mash Catholic/Jewish wedding. We got a lot of exemptions that dual  Catholics wouldn't receive. We had a non-church ceremony with a Catholic deacon, we had a Chuppah, my cousin did the 7 blessing on the wine, my sister did a Torah (Old Testment) reading or best man did the New Testament reading. Vows were mostly traditional Catholic, we opted out of the \"obey\" line. Husband stomped on the glass and everyone yelled Mazel Tov.

It\u2019s just facts.", "I\u2019ve heard of situations where someone was Jewish, but on their father\u2019s side.

Ashkenazim are not the only ethnically Jewish people.", "Actually, I couldn't. It was my ex husband, blue eyes, fair skin, black hair. His facial features were a spitting image of his father who was Polish and Catholic (paternal grandparents immigrated to the US in the early 1900's). He found out a decade after we were divorced that his maternal grandfather was Jewish. \n\nI deleted the original comment though, because of another comment later that says you trace the lineage through the mother's line, which he can't do, as this was his Mother's father.", "I love this!\n\nI have a dear friend who grew up in a Jewish family. She is also now an atheist but still honors the High Holy Days and Passover as that is part of her culture and ties her to her ancestors.", "Yes, she would. It is an ethnoreligion in the sense of the meaning of \u201cethnos\u201d in Ancient Greek which means \u2018nation\u2019. Jewishness is a \u2018national\u2019 identity, in the sense that there are multiple ways to become a member of the nation. The most straightforward is if you\u2019re the child of a Jewish mother, then you are Jewish and a member of the nation from birth. Even if you convert to another religion, you would still be considered Jewish per Jewish law because your mother was. \n\nNow, if you convert to Judaism, that\u2019s kind of like applying for citizenship in the nation and getting tested on your earnestness to join and knowledge of Judaism. If you convert in a traditional way, which involves a decision by a Jewish court and ritual immersion, you become a member of the nation - regardless of what your ethnic background is. If you\u2019re a woman who converted and you have kids after conversion, your children will be Jewish from birth. It would not matter that they\u2019re not \u2018genetically\u2019 connected to Judaism, because you joined the nation and your children are now direct descendants of a Jewish mother.", "She was also Black, Latina, and Native American, so yes.", "Thank you very much.
