Recently he has been flirting with me which I have ignored as I have a husband who is also friends with him. Yesterday while my husband was at work he asked if I would go on a date with him which I obviously said no to and was quite angry about him even thinking that at all. I told him to stop and that I don\u2019t think of him that way at all and that I have a husband. After this he continued to ask me to give him a chance which only made me more angry. I then told him to leave my house he then started to beg me not to kick him out and that he would be homeless. I didn\u2019t care at this point and kicked him out. When my husband got home later that day I explained to him what had happened and he agreed with me that he cannot stay in our home and to cut contact with him.
