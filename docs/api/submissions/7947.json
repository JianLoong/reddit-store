Good riddance to you.", "YTA but sometimes that's OK. She hurt you, you lashed out. These situations are awful it's never going to be sunshine and rainbows.", "NTA, she cheated on you.  Case over.", "YTA but who cares she is your ex.", "Meh. AH behaviour, but don't beat yourself up about it. She cheated", "YTA. -who puts something on top of a car when leaving it for another person? cheating isn\u2019t on the table-you messed with work that meant something to your ex.", "NTA cheating ex and his mother who can't stand you? You were very kind even when you brought something for her, and I recommend you ignore those who crucify you for leaving it in the car, they are only upset that you are not a woman because if the roles were reversed everyone would be cursing the unfaithful husband", "I\u2019d drop off the rest of her stuff on her door step and be done with this whole dumpster fire", "It would have been better if you posted on the revenge subreddit, I'm sorry you expect them to say \"she deserves it for cheating\", if she deserved it is a whole other matter, why didn't you leave things in front of the door, because she had to call you to find out about her things instead of you calling her?, since she was waiting for you to knock on the door; if it stresses you out so much MIL you would have cursed her when she started yelling or berating you, after all they are no longer family; but it seems that he just wanted to send your ex the message to \"fuck off\", and that's why YTA", "Unlike a lot of people I don't have a problem with where you put the papers. But you should have told your ex where they were ASAP so she could have her mom go out and get them. YTA for not letting her know where they were.", "NTA \n\nShe is no longer your wife ( so you owe her nothing ) \n\nYou are not FedEx ( so no one is paying you for signed delivery ).  \n\nIf exMIL did not yell at you all the time then *maybe* you would have hand-delivered.", "NTA! She ask for you to take them. You did. So what where you left them. Don\u2019t lose sleep over it.", "YTA for leaving it on the car. If you would have left it in some obvious spot somewhere near the house, I would say N T A. I get the anxiety that comes from any human interaction sometimes lol. So I get you not wanting to get the near door, not wanting her to see you. You really shouldn\u2019t use that as an excuse, though. That\u2019s something you need to be able to get over once in a while. But yeah, leaving it on top of a car? I literally would never have thought of that as option.", "I am going to be unpopular..I know...but.. she cheated. Then still expected you to ride around after her? Knowing you and her mum don't see eye to eye? If they were so important to her why not go get them herself instead of \"going out\"? Or asking her mum to go get them? And surely her mum would have seen the box on top of her car before she got in? But, that being said, I would have called her or texted her to tell her where you left it. \n\nSo I am going to vote BTA.", "YTA - you can't leave it at the door, on the porch/stoop/etc? You left it out in the open on a car? YTA", "Info: why does her mom hate you?", "ESH. Ex for literally asking for any favors after what she did, ExMIL for being nasty, and you for putting it on the car. While I don\u2019t think you owed her the effort of bringing it over, once you agreed you should have done things effectively. Putting it wherever and calling/texting would have been the better choice.", "YTA - The fact that you added \"I might have been a bit petty\" gives me the inclination that you intentionally put it in the dumbest spot out of spite. That make you the asshole. If you would have just left it at the door and something happens atleast you did what she asked..like why the roof of the car, that is the oddest place to put something?", "YTA, being cheated on doesn't give you free pass to be an asshole. I'm sure you knew what you were doing.", "YTA but revel in it mate, she cheated on you. The cow shat on your emotions.", "YNTA. An asshole would have burned the shit and sprinkled the ashes on her mom\u2019s car. She fucked around and after that you owe her NOTHING.", "MIL is TAH.  Why didn't she do something responsible with them?", "That's what stuck out to me too. Why the hell would you put something important on top of a car, and if you did  why wouldn't you send a text saying where it was?\n\nOP, YTA.", "I mean if they're so incompetent they don't notice a box of papers sitting on their car it isn't his fault. Where he left them isn't the problem. He should have texted immediately to let her know where they were though.", "Who knows if she is really a worse person, OP might be a complete nightmare", "Nta, her mom shouldn't drove if her eyes are that bad", "Dude. Grow up. YTA", "How many times do you except to find something on top of your car?  Personally I don't and neither do most people. What if it was a dark folder on a dark car at night.  Sometimes people are running out if the house and wouldn't notice a naked person doing the samba by their car.", "Yeah, this box thing was really passive aggressive.", "maybe but F cheaters. I wouldn't feel too bad about this even if you are an asshole in this situation.", "So you came here for justification of your behavior, not to truly reflect and ask if your behavior was wrong. Damn, you really are the asshole", "The ex could have been there to take ownership of the package.", "Then you call her and say come and get it.", "Oh you may be lost!  This is \u201cAm I The Asshole\u201d not \u201cDo I Owe Her Anything\u201d, it\u2019s a common mistake. Her cheating makes her an asshole. Him agreeing to drop off something off and destroying it instead makes him an asshole.\n\nIt\u2019s good to know that you\u2019d be willing to make your child\u2019s life harder during an already difficult time so you could be ultra cool and Totally Get Her Back, Ha Ha XD XD :D :D XD"]}
