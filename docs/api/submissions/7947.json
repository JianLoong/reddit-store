If you were too tired to do it right, you should have made other arrangements. You didn\u2019t have to talk to the MIL. You could have walked up to the door, set the package down, waved to the camera, and left. No awkward conversations necessary. Instead, you chose to sabotage your ex and ruin something meaningful and priceless that cannot be replaced. For what? Payback? You are the worst", "It's not that hard to just leave it in front of the door. Just walk up, put it down in front of the door, ring the doorbell and walk off.\n\nNobody can yell at you that way.\n\nInstead you choose to put it on top of a car exposed to the elements in the dark when it could easily be missed.\n\nYeah... No. ESH. Your ex should have just chosen a moment to pick it up herself. But you agreed to drop it off and then messed that up.", " \nThen she should had been home to pick her stuff up. Who leaves stuff at the door unattended if no one is at home? Doesn't the USA have a package stealing problem? So I get that op wanted to hide the stuff by putting it elsewhere where thieves might not look.", "Where did you get this idea?", "She should have got her other boyfriend to collect", "I think people would notice that.", "Idk about your country, but in mine, they literally require you to check your car before going. Like tires and shit. If you don't see a big box of stuff and other shit on your car, you shouldn't drive", "My husband put fish and chips on top of the car while he put something in the back and then drove off without remembering to get it, and he is the one who put it there. He only realised when he stopped at a light and it went flying off the roof and exploded open on the road. It is sadly entirely possible to not notice, though I agree it was potentially stolen here.", "I don't think he needs to do anything for OP.\n\nDid she think about what she was doing while she was getting fucked by multiple people while in a relationship.\n\nFuck her stuff.", "This made me giggle", "> Are you actually trying to claim that it's so dark that you cant see the roof of your car from 3-5 feet away \n\nyes, that's what darkness is...", "Okay\u2026 but you wouldn\u2019t have to interact with her if you set it on the door step. So what are u afraid of? Also, if we\u2019re going with that excuse, wouldnt you you be risking a worse interaction with her by putting that box on top of her car? Risking it falling on her when she opens the door, or sliding to the front damaging her mirror/wipers, scratching her car, her being surprised by and and getting into an accident, her tire getting punctured on a frame, etc. All of that sounds a lot riskier than setting it on a step and having zero interaction. And if you still decided to risk you ex-MIL\u2019s wrath and put it on her car, why not send her a pic of it letting her know the bizarre place you left it, huh? And if you were reallyyy that tired you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to do it, or you should have told her your\u2019d do it tomorrow. But you didnt and u committed to it so let\u2019s not play the blame game. Dont act dumb, you knew what you were doing. YAH. Also, you claim to be acting mature for the sake of yalls daughter, but if this is how your acting over a simple drop off, i can promise you you\u2019re not being as \u201cmature\u201d and secretive as you might think. You\u2019re probably espressing more animosity towards your ex than you realize and your daughter is seeing it all. I\u2019d do some reflection, be honest with yourself about your feelings on the situation, get therapy, and apologize.", "People regularly drive off with coffee cups on their car. A friend of mine put her phone on the car and only noticed when she saw it fly away in the rearview mirror on the highway. She was even listening to music in her car with a Bluetooth connection to the phone sitting on her car.\n\nGetting into a car and driving off is 100% muscle memory for most people, it's very common not to notice things when you're on autopilot. Don't put stuff on people's car. There's a high chance they'll miss it.\n\nAlso, the woman driving the car might have been short enough, and the car large enough, that it wasn't even visible from her point of view.", "I\u2019m short and I drive a crossover SUV. I absolutely would not notice a folder if you left it on top of my car\u2026because I\u2019m too short to see up there.", "Would you?\n\n[Here\u2019s a test](https://youtu.be/IGQmdoK_ZfY)\n\nThe study this is from showed about half the participants don\u2019t see what they don\u2019t expect.", "This made me giggle. I was driving behind my dad once and when he stopped at traffic lights, his reading glasses (thankfully in their case, they didn't break) flew off the top of his car. He'd left them there by accident after doing some shopping and completely forgot. I agree with you, it is definitely possible that she simply didn't see the paintings, but my mind did automatically think 'stolen'.", "The circumstances of their divorce are irrelevant. It would have been perfectly reasonable for him to not agree to going over and to let his ex-wife figure out a different way to get these items back. That is a very reasonable boundary. But once OP said he would drop them off at the front door or directly to her mom, he should either followed through or communicated he was not going to.", "If you have this little awareness of what is going on around you and your car than you shouldn\u2019t be driving or even have your licence! If it\u2019s that dark that you wouldn\u2019t see how TF would you manage to find the car door and handle?!", "Not really OP's problem.\n\nIt's her shit she should have looked after it.", "Found the incel lol", "Why does it seem like if OP were female and it was a man (FIL) screaming and OP was afraid and anxious, this thread would be singing a different tune", "Lol she still hasn't found her stuff", "And also why does MIL feel like she can even yell at him? Her daughter was the unfaithful one. Should he have left it on the car? No. But the ex should\u2019ve just gotten her stuff if she was so concerned with it being handled properly and stop asking op to do things for her."]}
