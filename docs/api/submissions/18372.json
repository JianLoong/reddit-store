You should have taken your wailing kid outside instead of disrupting his meeting. Heck, should've taken the bassinet or whatever outside and chilled with the baby in some shade because you *knew* he had an important meeting. You say this happened more than once, which means you needed to put baby in a different room during naptime. You shouldn't have the gall to tell people what to do in their own house. But also YTA because baby should have scheduled naptimes!!!! Routine is incredibly important for young children, mentally and physically, even at least *trying* to have a nap or quiet time within a certain time window every day.

I assumed this would be about them having some unnecessarily loud screaming match or party, or that they had the tv up too loud.

From what I know it's not recommended to keep children in complete silence during their naps as it causes sleeping issues later.

They didn\u2019t realise how they would need to be around your baby when napping (and getting used to having to be quiet takes a while and is unnatural) and you didn\u2019t realise that this was going to be an issue and you\u2019re sleep deprived.\n\nIt\u2019ll get better.
