She moved to a town about 45 minutes from our house, but works in the same town as us, and their son goes to school in our town, while the daughter goes to school in mom's town. So here's the sitch: the ex wife loves to buy old junker vehicles (she currently owns 3) instead of one even semi reliable vehicle, and they break down ALL THE TIME. Since she's usually at work in our town when they refuse to start, she just automatically asks my husband to come help her out, and quite often, to take the kids to her house 45 minutes away, for her. Now, ex wife has a boyfriend of her own that lives with her and the kids, but she NEVER calls him to help her out! Last night, hubby spent 2 hours driving the kids to their moms house, then driving back to our home. Aita for wanting him to tell her that he will NOT be bailing her out and helping her anymore? In my opinion, it's not his job! And she loves to make it into a thing about \"well its for the kids\" but if SHE made better choices and bought a decent car instead of spending thousands repairing these ancient hunks of junk, this wouldn't be happening. And she needs to call on her own damn boyfriend to help her, not take time away from us. She could have gotten a ride through Uber for crying out loud, but instead she always has to mess up our plans.", "created_utc": 1667333818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjk08q/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_stop_helping_his/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have you talked to him about it yet?", "NTA.   She is using him.  Good luck at getting him to do as you ask.", "NTA, he needs to draw the lines.  She has help (the bf) if her car takes a dive, or the kids need a ride on her time.  Should he be willing to help in the event of an emergency?  Of course! But day to day travel because she has a penchant for mechanically questionable vehicles?  Nah.  She needs to sort that out.\n\nI don't consider my ex my \"back up\", even with kid transport on my time.  I have a partner and myself, we sort it out.", "NTA.  It sounds like she is doing this on purpose.  You didn't say how your husband reacted after you told him to stop helping her so much.  Was he annoyed?  You should make sure everything is on the up and up with your husband.  This is all very shady.", "NTA. The wife is still trying to control her ex/your husband.  Talk to him about how this is making you feel. Don\u2019t approach it as she is a blank blank blank.", "I would say NTA - she is clearly using him. However you need to act carefully as there are kids involved and your husband needs to be there for them.", "NTA\n\nBuy her a year's subscription to a breakdown service for Christmas and tell her to make arrangements accordingly.", "NTA he is essentially enabling her bad choices with cars. My parents did the same thing - would give my BIL their nice cars every time his latest flashy toy broke down and then complained to me about how they never had their car to themselves. It was hilarious to see their face when I pointed out that they were the source of their own irritation. They stopped lending, he bought a more reliable car.", "NTA.\n\nHow often is this happening? Why can\u2019t her boyfriend come help her?", "NAH I really don't feel comfortable making a judgment based on this information. There isn't enough reason yet for me to label someone an asshole. Could there be a reason she does not call the boyfriend, maybe he is at work during the time she has to call?\n\nIf this is a constant problem and it seems like she only relies on your husband to help out, then yes you should have a conversation with your husband. And he should be the one to tell her he would prefer she has a reliable car, because yes that is important when she shares custody of the two kids. How you approach this discussion is really the deciding factor in whether or not you are the asshole in this situation.", "NTA. It is ok if ex spouses with kids together sometimes do a favor here and there as being friendly enough to be good co-parents is important for your children. My ex wife had to go out of town for a business trip on her time with the kids and instead they came to my house and their easy to deal with dog came also. On the flip side, I've occasionally had work things where I couldn't pick up the kids or realistically spend time with them due to work obligations. It doesn't happen often, but that is life. We can work it out with no harm.\n\nThis is different. She doesn't live close by. Her choice to buy shitty cars is hers alone and needing to fix the cars has happened repeatedly. More importantly, she has a live in boyfriend who should be taking responsibility for these sorts of issues.", "NTA for wanting better boundaries is good. She sounds abit dependent on him still. \n\nWhat are the visitation rules in the divorce regarding who is responsible for ensuring the kids get to the parent who gets the kids to visitstion for the weekend.", "Need bit more back info. Whats the relationship between your husband and his ex like, and might she have additional motive? Also, how often does it happen? Cause if it's once a month and it means he does spend quality time with his kids, that's a completly different story then him being an easy backup call taxi and the car rides add little emotional bonding between dad and kids.\n\nI think NTA. This sounds like you clearly need to set some boundaries. Maybe nudge her to buy one solid car and keep the others for hobbies. But also come to a compromise that her boyfriend starts picking her up. You can also offer \"if uts for the kids than son x can stay over at our place for tge night, until your cars fixed.\" So that she needs to get her own cab", "NTA. Once is accident, twice is coincidence, three times is deliberate. She's absolutely deliberately messing up your plans. He needs to lay down the law with her. He is NOT a chauffeur. If she can't handle caring for the kids and their transportation, it might be time to look into custody changes. However, the kids are in HS. This will not be forever. She's going to have them in college or on their own soon and have this means of causing you both a headache, gone. Now, is she ACTUALLY that broke, or using money on stupid stuff. I have had two very old vehicles before. One was less than $300, the other less than $1700.  I could have bought ten of the first type before buying a single \"decent\" car, and as an old car it was super cheap to fix. If her junkers are junkers to that point...well, it may not be stupid financially, just factually what is possible. \\*I\\* got two highly reliable old cars, but not everyone knows enough about cars to not pick a lemon. The choosing not to call her boyfriend? Or an Uber? Or just say  \"I can't take the kids this weekend, I am trying to fix the transmission\" is all on her.", "Going with NTA I think depending on how often it's happening. Once in a while I can see jumping in to help. But if it's every week even every other week yeah they need to come to an understanding. He's not her husband anymore she needs to work on figuring some things out for herself not go for the default of he'll help.", "I thought I was going to think Y T A, but under the circumstances, she's just taking advantage.  She can get AAA, call her boyfriend, take an Uber, whatever.  It's time your husband started pushing back and telling her he's sorry but he can't bail her out this time.  He could help her a couple of times a year or something, but not all the time.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe needs to get her own man to help....or triple A. He needs to be there for you and tell her take care of herself and be a big girl", "ESH\n\nThe ex wife is taking advantage of your husband. She expects him to do whatever \u201cfor the kids\u201d.\n\nYour husband lacks boundaries, He\u2019s doing all of this nonsense out of post divorce guilt \u201cfor the kids\u201d.  If he has plans with you he should tell her that he\u2019s not available. \n\nYou kind of suck for thinking her boyfriend should be expected to do anything. They\u2019re not his kids. \n\nBottom line is that you have a husband problem not an ex wife, kid, or BF problem. Would you be the AH to ask him to stop? No. But you can bet it will be a challenging discussion. He\u2019s used to bending over backwards at her whim and has convinced himself it\u2019s for the kids. So he is likely to snap back with \u201cyou just don\u2019t understand\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no reason for a big discussion between him and BM. He could just tell her he\u2019s not available when she calls. But good luck with that. LOL\n\nI say all of this as a SM. I get it.", "NAH.\n\nYou're not in the wrong for asking your husband to stop helping. If he agrees he shouldn't be doing all of that for her, then he should definitely stop doing it. The ex-wife has made some dumb decisions, but she's not an AH by any means.", "ESH. Your hubby for allowing this behavior, the ex wife for relying on him and using their kids as pawns, her boyfriend for not stepping up and *offering to help* so your husband doesn\u2019t have to and you for your controlling elitist attitude. It is hard for someone to get a reliable car that requires loans and financing in a lot of situations, where as a beater can be bought with tax return money or any other random money that isn\u2019t already allotted to a necessary bill. No matter what you think of her choices she is the mother of your husband\u2019s children and it could negatively impact them for you begin dictating how their father is allowed to interact with her.", "NTA \n\nI hope your husband understand where you are coming from. Maybe get her bfs number so when she calls your husband you call her hubby to get her.\ud83d\ude02 and if she calls again you answer the phone and say that you are away on other things at the moment so you cant help her sorry\ud83d\ude48", "INFO: Have you actually told him to stop or are you merely thinking about it?", "ESH - soft blame also on you\n\nIt sounds like his ex is awful, and I'm very sorry you and your husband have to put up with that. I do not know what the fix is here, but it is not a bad thing that he is showing up for his kids. That is huge and very good of him. He needs to continue to be there for them and show up, regardless of whether it is her fault or not. \n\nI do think there needs to be some fix, like he picks up the kids and brings them home and she can come get them when she can get her car situation figured out or something. I don't think he needs to chauffeur them around during her time and get them from/to her house, but he absolutely should be showing up for them whenever needed.", "YTA. Even if it is the ex\u2019s fault for buying shitty cars it IS to help his kids. Your husband is a grown man and can make his own decisions. If it is a priority for him to keep a good relationship with his ex for the sake of coparenting their kids, that\u2019s his choice. \n\nYou should always come second to his kids. Always. That\u2019s what your signed up for.", "YTA\n\nHe's helping his children and the mother of his children.", "YTA\n\nHe's right in making an exception when it impacts the kids.", "Info:\n\nWhy can't he say that anytime this happens that son is staying at yours?\n\nHusband does only the commute he was going to, ex's BF can get the daughter if there's no school bus, easy walk, and the ex can sort the car out.\n\nIf it was really about the kid's she shouldn't have an issue.", "YTA. First of all, he's not helping her, he's helping his kids. Which it very much is his job. And secondly, what do you care how he spends his time? Are you jealous? If it's about missing time to spend with him, why don't you go along for the two hour car ride and keep him company instead of complaining?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not the ex\u2019s responsibility.  The only person that is messing up your plans is the husband.  There need to be boundaries and you need to explain that to him.  If she wants to buy junk cars that\u2019s on her but it shouldn\u2019t impact you life.  This is not about the children.", "NTA\n\nYour husband needs to remember that he divorced her and married you.", " NTA", "NAH. Your husband has kids to think about, and he's going to make the decision that is best for them, not for you.", "INFO:\n\nHave you had any sort of adult conversation about this with your husband? Because at the end of the day, she is the mother to his children, and if he wants to go help then he's allowed to do that.", "He's a fool", "INFO: Do you know the ex's boyfriend's work and transportation situation? Do you know the ex's and the boyfriend's financial situation?", "Yta you do not control him so get over your self", "It's happening almost every week, and she doesn't bother to even call her bf, because it's more convenient to just call my husband", "Agree with this.  And to add, we have 2 shitty cars. We\u2019d LOVE to have 2 nice cars, but money is a real thing. It\u2019s much easier to spend a couple hundred dollars every couple of months on a fix(that I usually do myself), then hundreds of dollars a month, every month on a car payment.", "She responded to my comment saying it happens weekly.", "I disagree a bit. The boyfriend is living with her and the kids. And this isn't actually \"for the kids\", it's for her because it's her car. If the boyfriend is going to live with and have a relationship with a woman with kids, he can help out a bit here and there. Like either picking up the girl from school and/or coming to see if he can fix mom's car.", "How is my attitude elitist? I never once implied that she was less than or that she didn't have money. She has the money, but chooses to keep spending it on these shitty cars instead of just having one reliable one. I am not a wealthy person by any means, but I definitely understand how to prioritize, and means of transportation is pretty high up there, especially when she's the one who chose to move to a house 45 minutes away from her job...", "He/we ALWAYS show up for the kids when they need us... But when she keeps spending thousands on her hobby cars instead of buying ONE reliable one, and then breaks down almost weekly, I don't see why THAT should be his problem. The kids were happy at our house, where they could have stayed instead of making hubby schlep them", "I agree. If the kids weren\u2019t involved or potentially being left stranded, it would be a different story. But, as long as the kids are with her, he will need to help his kids, no matter what. I actually give him credit for putting his kids first despite his current wife\u2019s anger.", "The mother of his children refuses to spend her money on a vehicle that would be safe and reliable for their children, and instead keeps sinking thousands into old beaters for fun, and every week when they die on her, she just expects him to drop everything and fix it for her. This doesn't really have to do with being there for the kids. They were safe and happy in my home, where they could have waited for her to figure out her ride situation. This was not a one time thing, it's just about every week, which has become excessive and I feel she is taking advantage of his love for the kids", "But if her constant bad decisions are constantly effecting him and his house as well as the kids he needs to put his foot down. Kids stay with him if mom can\u2019t get her shit together.", "This - I\u2019m sure she would love to have a nicer newer car than a piece of junk if she could afford it.  Many people can\u2019t afford the payments or qualify for a loan it\u2019s not that unusual.", "Yeah, I'm unsure about the car thing, because I do think a reliable car is important but if she's struggling financially then it's certainly not intentional. OP makes it seem like she just has a bunch of junkers around because she likes fixing them, but people I know who enjoy that sort of thing tend to have a main vehicle that is in decent condition.\n\nIf she does not have a reliable car because she can't take on the financial burden of a newer vehicle, then if OP's husband is a lot better off financially (and two income household can make a world of difference!) then I hope he helps her out. It's best for the kids, plus then OP won't have to deal with the constant inconvenience that seems to be her main issue.", "Thank you lol. The kids could have just stayed at our house and we would have had some fun or something, while they waited for her to sort out a ride, but when she can't even be bothered to TRY calling someone else, that's where it becomes a favor for her, not the kids, who we ALWAYS put first and would happily help any time they needed it", "That I totally understand. That sounds like that is the boundary that needs to be set. He needs to show up for the kids, but not for her. As long he shows up for them when her irresponsibility rears up, that is what matters. Completely agree that he shouldn't be driving them everywhere for her or constantly taking them to her house. If she breaks down, he gets them and brings them home, and then SHE can figure herself out and how to get them herself.", "Thank you! Problem is, she wouldn't be struggling financially if she would just STOP working on her hobby cars for a while, and save the tons of money she keeps pouring into them. These are hobby cars that she buys for fun, which is why I'm upset"]}
