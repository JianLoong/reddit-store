Recently, he has been in and out of prison again, and I have been refusing to see him until he can prove he has changed himself as a person. My sister thinks this is a dick move for me to make because he, quote \"needs me\" right now. I have been wanting to cut him off for years due to his unnecessary screaming, shouting and name calling towards me. Whenever I was at his house, since my mother and him have been divorced for 12 years, he would always tell me to go get him a beer even though he promised to stop drinking, he would scream at me for falling asleep on the couch (which is where I slept since I didn't have my own room) during \"game time\". He would basically just be a raging ass to me. I tried my best to see good in him, but life has been so much better for me since I started standing my ground and telling my sister that I don't want to see him. Although he is trying to be a better person, I highly doubt he will change that much, and because I only see him as my biological father, I refuse to call him dad. I have been wanting to call my mothers husband, my stepfather, my dad instead. That is because he has been in my life since I was born and has spent more time with me than Rob ever has. My sister disagrees with me on this, saying that it is not fair for me to call my stepdad my dad, and that I should be trying harder to see what Rob is facing. So, am I the asshole in this situation?Because I don't know.\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone for all the kind words and support, I felt the need to share this with someone where no one knows me and won't side with me just because they know me or don't want to hurt my feelings with honesty. I have been told I was the AH in this situation and I thought reddit was the perfect place to come, big thank you to everyone", "created_utc": 1683983766, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ghbx7/aita_for_refusing_to_call_my_biological_father_dad/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Save it for the one has been the father figure in your life, treats you well, respects you and has earned your respect. Don't waste your time on the other who is just a waste of space. Your sister can do as she please and you don't have to do anything as you don't owe anything to the biological visitor.", "NTA. The title 'Dad' is not a right. As long as you don't use it as a weapon, you give it to the person who exemplifies this for you. Period.", "NTA- let your sister know that she and you have had very different relationships with Rob, and you don\u2019t want a relationship with him as he has been abusive to you. You have a close bond with Stepdad, and see him as the man who raised you. You don\u2019t care what Rob thinks about this as he was basically a sperm donor and has contributed nothing positive to your life.

It sounds like your feelings towards your dad are very much valid & it\u2019s unfair for your sister to be pressuring you to be closer than him than you feel comfortable to. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable to call him dad, then why should you have to? And if you feel more inclined to call your stepdad dad then no one should be telling you not to, especially since he\u2019s been in your life since you were born. You can make your own decision on what makes you feel safer and more comfortable, the decision shouldn\u2019t be made for you", "NTA. You're allowed to feel the way you do, sister should mind her own business. You don't owe your biological father a relationship just because his sperm helped to create you, especially considering the abuse.
