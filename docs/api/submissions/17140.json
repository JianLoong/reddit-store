Recently, he has been in and out of prison again, and I have been refusing to see him until he can prove he has changed himself as a person. My sister thinks this is a dick move for me to make because he, quote \"needs me\" right now. I have been wanting to cut him off for years due to his unnecessary screaming, shouting and name calling towards me. Whenever I was at his house, since my mother and him have been divorced for 12 years, he would always tell me to go get him a beer even though he promised to stop drinking, he would scream at me for falling asleep on the couch (which is where I slept since I didn't have my own room) during \"game time\". He would basically just be a raging ass to me. I tried my best to see good in him, but life has been so much better for me since I started standing my ground and telling my sister that I don't want to see him. Although he is trying to be a better person, I highly doubt he will change that much, and because I only see him as my biological father, I refuse to call him dad. I have been wanting to call my mothers husband, my stepfather, my dad instead. That is because he has been in my life since I was born and has spent more time with me than Rob ever has. My sister disagrees with me on this, saying that it is not fair for me to call my stepdad my dad, and that I should be trying harder to see what Rob is facing. So, am I the asshole in this situation?Because I don't know.\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone for all the kind words and support, I felt the need to share this with someone where no one knows me and won't side with me just because they know me or don't want to hurt my feelings with honesty.

No need to respect a sperm donor", "I don't think that you need more responses to validate this for you, but I'll give you this one anyway...\n\nI think I know where your sister is coming from and it's a place of hurt. She remembers fun times and loving times with your bio-father. You don't really. And much of what she remembers may be tempered because Rob and your mother were together during dinner formative times for her. But as you were 3 when they got divorced, you didn't have the protection of mom when you saw Rob. \n\nYou got Rob on his own, without interference from mom to make good memories anyway. And that sucks, but it's also good.\n\nYour sister may feel obligation and love to her dad, because she has those memories. You don't have those feelings, because you don't have those memories. Your sister may even have memories of Rob being loving to you, but you don't.\n\nWhen my brother didn't want to see my mom anymore, it gutted me. When he started calling our stepmother \"mom\", I saw red. I couldn't believe that he would do that or that our dad would let him. \n\nThe thing is, I was hanging on so hard to those memories I knew of my mother. Not always stellar, but she was my mom - OUR mom. At the same time, I was seeing all the reasons that my mom wasn't a great parent (and sometimes not a good person). But she was my Mom. I could complain about her to my friends, but no one was allowed to badmouth her. And my brother calling someone else \"mom\" (or any derivative of it) was badmouthing her, in my eyes. \n\nIt took a while, but I got over it. One thing that helped was having a loving stepmother. One that didn't push for me to accept her as \"mom\" and fully supported my relationship with my mother and let me be when my time with her went poorly (not that she wasn't there for comfort if I needed it, she just didn't try to swoop in). Also seeing my mother's self-destructive and overall destructive behaviors as I got more into adulthood. \n\nYou're NTA. But your sister is hurting. You need to let her know that her relationship with her dad is up to her. But he's hurt you too many times in your short amount of time on this earth. \"He needs you\" should be coming from your side, not from his. \u2764\ufe0f", "This made me tear up a little.. I really appreciate when people tell their story along with mine, it makes me feel so safe and accepted. Thank you for sharing, I hope that my sister will soon be able to accept this. I don't think she will though, my sister is on the autism spectrum and doesn't like when things go her way. She is a lot like her dad, she has also been diagnosed with ODD and Bipolar, so I try my best to see from her perspective but it just hurts a little bit that she hasn't come to accept that my father was never there for me. Especially since she still loves him after he tried to murder her twice.. I can tell she's hurting but I am too, and not only that, I'm traumatised and am the only one in my family who hasn't received comfort or therapy. Thank you for being comfortable enough to share your story \u2764\ufe0f"]}
