None of us let our parents see our kids unsupervised or let them babysit. We also never borrow money from them or take any blessings because we don't want anything that will make us feel owed. I have 2 kids(13F and 11M) and I am a single dad(my late wife passed away due to brain aneurysm when youngest was only a year old) so I am raising them by myself with the help of sister and ILs. One day, we were at my parents house and while they were looking around the attic, they found the old photos of us. It had photos with my brother. Until that moment, they didn't know who he was and they asked who was he. I said \"It's your uncle.\" and told the story. My parents were looking really distressed and they asked us to leave. My sister later said I acted like an asshole and I should have told the story at my own house,not in their house where these memories were still ingrained.

Hell no. They should feel bad. No one should tip toe around it. That\u2019s traumatizing for the siblings as well.\n\nNTA about time they face the music", "NTA, your kids are 11 and 13, they are teenagers already. I am sure they know bad people exist and if they didn't until this point it was an important lesson about personalities, psyche and parenting. If your parents still feel so emotional about all of this they should get psychotherapy or any other help to deal with this trauma and don't make you feel bad about it. Your attitude towards this is a healthy approach to an uncomfortable topic and you handled it teenager-appropriately. Rugsweeping and concealing the family trauma is not dealing with it or healing, it will only divide your family.", "**NTA!**  Your children asked, and you answered with the truth.  Mommy and daddy didn't DEFEND the other children from brother then, why would you be bothered to make things smooth NOW?  Oh yeah, it was never, will never be YOUR job to defend your parents/brother.  It IS your job to make sure your kids have ALL the info they need to make THEIR choices/and to **PROTECT them** from ALL toxic people/even relatives.", "NTA. Your parents could have stepped in at any time and distracted the kids and told you quietly to inform them at your house if they felt uncomfortable talking about it at home. Instead they went behind your back and complained to family members.", "I say NTA. \n\nCould you maybe have brought it up at a better time? Sure, okay\nBut your parents also have to face the concequences of their own actions. \nIf you had told your child \"we'll talk about it later\", they could've asked \"why?\" and again, put you in an equally awkward situation.\n\nAll you did was answer your child's question honestly. You can't always predict how someone's gonna react to what you have to say.", "Wow your parents sound terrible. Honestly I think the issue is maybe your kids would be too young to hear this? \n\nAlso I agree with your sister you could have told them at home. NTA though because it sounds like you\u2019ve had a really tough life and you\u2019re doing well for yourself and I think your parents honestly deserve it.", "NTA. Your parents did nothing to defend you or your sister from your brother.", "NTA, your parents are responsible for your brother, it's good to be honest with your kids, your parents need to own their mistake  they were not fit to be parents", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
