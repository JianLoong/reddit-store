Why not place him in a treatment facility that might actually help him? His disorder can't be cured but with early treatment the chances that this person can be a non-violent member of society are there. Especially if they put in the effort to find a facility that is specialised on people like him and know how to reach these children as they need different modes of treatment than let's say a child with a conscience but an inability to control themselves", "As has been pointed out there isn't a lot of \"managing\" to it. Sometimes, in the LONG term, if a patient wants to get better CBT can help but the patient has to be willing to do the work. \n\nThe better solution is minimizing the damage the person can do and getting treatment for those harmed.

Hate to use the phrase asking for it but\u2026..", "> They do not respond to therapy.\n\nThis isn't 100% correct. CBT has had success in some cases.

To the dismay of about any doctor who's neither a neurologist nor a psychiatrist I have two anxiety medications and two antidepressants so I can function, I had extensive inpatient and outpatient treatment and rehab and for a year now I have a therapist I feel good with that deals with complex trauma (the only other two who deal with that who aren't full for years are one without license for public healthcare and one who tried to make me feel compassion for my abusers in the first session). I needed to apply for disability retirement but there's hope I can work again in a few years unless my physical health issues get worse. There's hope I might completely heal before I'm 40 and I am surrounded by people who love me dearly. I even got so far in therapy that I got rid off all the \"friends\" who treated me badly (and am able to recognize when they do. A year ago I would have said x is just stressed, now I see her for the toxic, spiteful person she is and got rid of her among several others). I accepted that I never get justice and accepting that and seeing how many people with similar circumstances end up in much worse situations in life (I saw one friend fall from ine abusive relationship into the next, one become toxic and know how many struggle with substance abuse as well as cares for those who are too mentally harmed by abuse to ever live independently before I became physically disabled) I'd say I have a happy end. It's not a Disney happy end but for real life it is one. I'm even so blessed that when I have moments of struggle with the injustice of things there's always someone there to hug me and tell me I'm loved and a good person.", "I doubt that will happen but one may dream.

As a child I naively assumed when they became an adult it would somehow get better (and then my mom would magically get better too) but all it did was become legal issues and they've never figured out how to live a life as a decent human.

Nevermind the fact that part of my job in children's welfare is working with psych wards anyways.", "Getting rid of your kid is not turning to professionals for help.
