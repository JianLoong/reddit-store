I think you're NTA, but you definitely didn't need to unearth that at their house and in front of them, I understood that there may be some resentment, all of you may need therapy to deal with these things, so seek professional help if you can.", "Going into detail about it to your kids was bad enough, but especially in front of you parents was entirely unnecessary. Your kids don't need to know the details at all. My father is let's say similarly problematic. My kids know that he's not in our lives because he's not a good/ safe person. That's enough. If you'd left it at that, you would have been fine. Instead you forced your parents to listen to you detail your brother's problems, and you put the burden of that knowledge on your kids.

He headed towards a forensic path because that's often the way for people diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder.

They need to take ownership.\n\nAt the same time, now that you know it affects them deeply, it would be respectful on your part to acknowledge that and perhaps choose to have these conversations out of earshot of them.

Your sister is right. YTA. You essentially let out the dirtiest skeleton in the closet, that paints your parents in the absolute worst light, in front of them. Intentional or not, this can be perceived as a deliberate act of petty revenge. Even if your parents are deserving of the shame this will bring them, I can't think of any reason to have done so in front of them, much less in a way that details your full lived experience. You could have simply said he's mentally unwell and a danger to anyone who gets close to him.\n\nMy honest thoughts are that you still hold a lot of anger and resentment for that period of your life. And while I do think it's your right to continue to hold your parents accountable, I feel the way you choose to unload this story ultimately does nothing but hurt everyone involved.\n\nIt deliberately hurts your parents, but now it may forever shade the way your kids view them, and whether you acknowledge it or not, that hurts them.

The parents did nothing to protect their other children. And it's perfectly logical that this causes resentment. My mom was depressed and victim of a narcissistic husband (and as she got older the victim of my brother's verbal abuse). My brother fits all the criteria for ASPD and abused me horribly. My mother while often not being able to do enough at least tried to protect me and without her things would have been worse.

Mom pulled her out bec she was extremely combative and it went nowhere. As kids she tried to kill me a few times and also tried to break my arm when she wasn't getting her way. She's still an absolute menace that blames everything on everyone else and talking to her makes me skin crawl. She revels in the fact that she view people as objects to be used / pawns to be manipulated, and has every excuse in the book to refuse to seek therapy or medication. My mom tried so much to get her in order she once told me \"figure it out, I can't deal with this right now. Your sister is more important\" after violently confronting me about self harming.\n\nI wasn't able to get into therapy until I was 22 and that statement severely damaged my relationship with my mom.

They do not respond to therapy. They do not respond to standard medications. Basically you nuke their brain on heavy antipsychotics and stick them in a room until they die.
