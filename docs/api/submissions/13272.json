HOWEVER, it doesn't mean you should just dismiss her feelings and not try to talk it out. A better response could've incorporated, y'know, your *romantic relationship* versus a *physical-based attraction* (a **crush**) on Shawn Mendes. Sometimes women can be irrational (don't come for my throat redditors pls I am a woman speaking from experience), so it's important to take a cool, calm, and collected stance to explain it properly instead of dismissing it all. Honestly, that can be said for any gender in any relationship.\n\nWas it a good joke? Hell yeah, I'd say Natalie Portman is the most attractive person over my S/O and they'd (hopefully) appreciate it because they understand because of communicating about stuff like this.

Maybe throw in a few sappy things like \"you're the most beautiful girl to me, it's why I love you and who you are, I just find Shawn Mendes hot\" blah blah blah (note: if you're at that point, if not then uh substitute for something more stage-appropriate to where your relationship is at).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSincerely:\n\nSomeone who dealt with a crazy S/O in the past who would obsess over stuff like this (and someone who does too personally sometimes).", "I mean you both handled it wrong.

The whole attraction, I want this person, and I lust for them? That's my partner... I also have no interest in porn, I understand some people enjoy it - but it holds no interest for me.
