My parents had divorced when I was 11 as their relationship was incredibly rocky and full of fights, but I had never recognized it until much later in life.\n  My dads family had never liked my mom, they talked shit about her even before my parents divorced, which brings us to today.

She wasn\u2019t as forgiving to my dad as I used to be.\n  I stood up my seat and started yelling at my dad, I told him to shut the fuck up and that he had no right to talk about my dead mother like that.

Meaning the trauma experienced was amplified.  \n\nSecond, please, please find a counselor to help you figure out the important parts of what happened when you were growing up, and show you some basic tools to deal with those.  It is not weak, nor a waste of time/money.  On the contrary, it is medicine for what has happened to you; it can be accomplished in a relatively short time period and can even be carried out remotely.  \n\nThird, your father was in the wrong, for allowing/participating in that kind of garbage at all, much less, publicly and within your hearing.

Obviously you father has told the rest of the family a bunch of lies to make himself look good. And they easily believed him because they hated her to begin with.

It is a shame it happened at a wedding though. Yeah, you did ruin it. I\u2019m gonna go with ESH. I think you should go NC with dad and his entire family. All you will get from them is grief.

So I don\u2019t blame you for not addressing this privately. And abusing your child\u2019s mother is also child abuse as well. You and you sister had the right to a mom who was happy and he took that from you. Leaving your child\u2019s mother with \u2018nothing\u2019 isn\u2019t being a good father. Your sister not attending the wedding speaks volumes. Sounds like she\u2019s had enough and cut him off completely. As for him being a changed man, I don\u2019t think he has. To change and be better you need to acknowledge the horrible things you\u2019ve done in the past.

My dad had never talked like this before, and had even admitted many of his faults during that marriage, which is why I had always still tried to stay with him throughout my life. It\u2019s a hard thing to give up contact with your only living parent. But after all of this, I think many of you are right and that no contact is the best thing I can do to better myself.

He is such a great dad that his own daughter didn't come to celebrate his happy day?", "If that's the case, I am sorry but it's wrong of you to blame your father for leaving and for your father's death. It may have been hard on your mother, but it sounds like a very unhappy marriage that happened for the wrong reasons. If he was neglectful of his obligations to his children or denied your mother a proper marriage settlement, that would be another matter, but you don't mention anything like that. And, with all respect to your mother's memory, she may well have treated your father badly; it sounds as if you don't want to know what went down.", "I have a shitty dad who will sometimes admit his faults to give me a false sense of security. It's not worth it. They will never really change. I went no contact with him 5 months ago. It has been heaven. At some point, you have to realize the hurt you're experiencing is self-inflicted because you won't just give up.", "I'm really sorry for your experience. You deserve better and your father failed in his duties to respect the boundaries of speaking of your late mom.  Even if he felt that way, why would he and his family discuss it at his wedding to a new woman? That's crazy. There's a time and place and I would posit that the time and place would be in a therapist's office, not at a wedding and certainly not within earshot of the child of said late parent.

I wish you the best.\n\nNTA.", "I totally understand that, I haven\u2019t had contact with my mom in 20 years. My dad isn\u2019t perfect but he raised us and tried hard.

It was the strangest feeling. \n\nI hope your situation improves, it sounds like you\u2019ve been through a lot.", "NTA. Your response seems clearly triggered by childhood trauma and not entirely in your ability to control. And it was frankly, disrespectful and gross, for your father and family to be speaking ill of your mother in your presence. I agree that NC with your dad would be wise. Finding a good counselor/therapist would also be great; for you, not for meeting anyone else\u2019s expectations of you. None of us are free from our experiences and mental health affecting our daily lives and if anyone says differently, they\u2019re lying, right? Having someone to talk to has helped me tremendously. \n\nAlso this: If you dad continues to go through life telling people he was a great father and husband in his first marriage, while clearly having no relationship with his two children; most people will see him for what he is.", "Nta. If he didnt want a response he shouldn't have said anything at *his wedding *", "NTA.   Who talks shit about the first wife at the wedding of the second?

I hope that telling him off gave you a bit of closure, and I'm glad that you've blocked them all. You didn't overreact. It was years in the making, and your father lit the match.", "Right? Came here to say this. Why did he feel the need to gripe about his ex who happened to have passed, within earshot of the woman\u2019s son, at his own wedding. I'd ask that question of everyone who accused OP.", "ESH, you can't blame him for your mom's demise if it was that long after the divorce. Regardless of the issues in the marriage your mom was single and should have been working on her own life after they separated instead of blaming him all those years. You really have no idea what happened in their marriage behind closed doors, although they definitely weren't good together.", "YTA for blaming your dad for your mom\u2019s death, yes. You don\u2019t even know the cause of her death so blaming another human being for it is wrong. Second, you probably need therapy to better manage your emotions. Raging like that at a wedding is wrong, no matter what you think you heard. You have no idea what the truth is. You just have emotions, and you need a healthy way to manage them.", "nta", "NTA and blocking all of them was the right decision. Try to move on with your life and forget your bio-father.

Also, if his lying tendencies are not new, that's very possibly why his family hates your mom.", "Wrong.  You do NOT bash your child's parent.  No excuses, no  more information needed.", "Well since they divorced when OP was 11, he did in fact witness how his parents behaved. He actually stated hiw \"rocky\" the marriage was. And even if she was abusive - talking about a pregnancy ruining his life in front of his son? Come on, OP was absolutely justified to vent his anger.", "You don\u2019t talk trash about your children\u2019s mother especially if the mother is dead.  My mother is very much still alive and I dare my AH sperm donor to say one word against her.  He is lucky that OP only \u201cruined\u201d his wedding.

It has been so much better since I made that decision.  My sister decided to cut him out of her life as well because she didn\u2019t want him to treat her daughter like he was treating us.  My brother is the only one who has any contact with our biological father and that is very limited.", "NTA what so ever. You and your sister have been through it. If you can, try to find a therapist.

Also a super inappropriate topic to bring up at a wedding in the first place, as well as extremely insulting to say his life was ruined because he had kids in front of said kids. He had issues because he was a dumbass that didn't practice safe sex at 18. Seems like if he was getting married again he was doing OK, anyway....", "YOU ARE A GREAT SON!!", "NTA.
