What's the point of that comment? People do or say dumb things when it comes to their loved ones or animals. Would you also say to a new mum that her baby looks like a wrinkly scrotum? Newborn babies aren't always cute or everyone's cup of tea. I may not find a new baby cute, but I also have no right to shit on what others think is cute.", "NTA. I love sphinx cats, but the kittens do honestly look like a nutsack. And your aunt constantly going on about it would get annoying. I needed this laugh today, so thank you xD", "NTA I have 10 cats of my own, rescue as a hobby out of my own pocket, and volunteer at my local cat shelter. I very much love cats. This is so fuckin funny; great response, I love my fur babies but I wouldn't go on about them for HOURS", "NTA I think sphynx cats are super cute, AND they totally look nutsack, the two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. You would have been an asshole if you\u2019d instead told her the part about just getting a rescue instead (which I agree with, btw, but it\u2019s none of my business what other people decide to do) It\u2019s awkward for them to have to explain it to the little girl, but knowing proper names for body parts isn\u2019t a bad thing.", "Really? Did it make you feel good insulting something she's excited about and attached to? You wanted to raise you cool factor with an insult? You demonstrated that put-downs are OK since no one called you on it during the meal. What an ass. \n\nYTA; no doubt about it. If you can't say anything nice then don't comment. Your opinion about rescue vs. pedigree pets is again; your view.", "YTA\n\nEver heard the old saying, \"If you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all?\"  Yeah.  I think it's time you relearn that saying because what you said was way off base.  Doesn't matter what you think, but words hurt.  No different than your aunt putting you down for something you're happy about.\n\nAnyone who is saying \"NTA\" apparently doesn't know basic manners or this phrase of common courtesy.", "NTA and thanks for making me laugh out loud during a work meeting!", "Nta\u2026 except you know that and posted here for extra laughs. So a tiny bit douchey because you know that it was hilarious. But excusable. Nta and very funny. Next time you see her bring the cat furry balls to play with.", "Lmfaoooooooooooooooooo", "NTA. Sphinx cats are neat cats, and they even have their own kinda cutenrss about em, but yes, they definitely look like scrotums, naked chickens, etc. Lol, your aunt should have been prepared for the harmless comments towards the cat.", " NTA I\u2019m a sphinx lover (not owner) myself and I even say they look like balls, or a raw chicken. Your kin needs to get a sense of humor.", "i\u2019m gonna go with NTA. you\u2019re not wrong especially if she had the kitten in her lap, and you used the correct term, rather than say ballsack.", "NTA.. That is the funniest thing I have read all day.", "NTA - WELL DONE, your uncle is gonna be telling that story at every family gathering for AGES", "\"scrotum\" nta, \"nut sack\" or other non anatomical description, yta, but a funny and correct one ;)", "YTA\n\nShe was clearly excited and she is clearly very attached to th kitten already. Did it make you feel good to be this rude for no reason? Fine! She was annoying. We are all annoying sometimes when we're so excited about something we just can't shut up about it, but that's why we have friends and family, to be able to share this excitement with even if sometimes we get a little annoying. It was one evening, not one year of this.", "NTA \n\nIf her only complaint is that use used a supposedly gross word at the dinner table I don't think she's actually mad. Probably agrees and was scolding you for show to appease your aunt.", "No hahahah nta. I love sphynx cats and acknowledge they absolutely look like BAWLS. Additionally I agree that breeding and selling animals is unethical.", "NTA.\n\nAnd thank you for sharing this.", "I LOVE sphinx cats. I think they\u2019re the cutest things ever, but even I would say something like that lmao I don\u2019t know many pet owners that don\u2019t rag on their own pets in one way or another. You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA I love those cats so much I'd absolutely have one if it somehow showed up in my life but they do be looking scrotish. Straight up scrote cat. \ud83d\udc80 Naked turkey cats.   All cats just look like that without their hair LOL it's not some crazy insult.", "Ok, you might be the AH...that doesn't mean it wasn't funny or justified.", "NTA\n\nI love cats. I don't have any of my own because of my disabilities/chronic illness, but it's not an exaggeration that 99% of my closest friends are either involved in veterinary medicine or animal rescue. Several of them are obsessed with sphinx cats. The rest of us refer to them as \"greasy sausage cats\". \n\nIt's pretty normal for people to have strongly divided reactions to them, and honestly, if you don't like them (and many of us don't), they really do appear to be kind of gross and greasy. \"Scrotum\" is not an inapt description, LOL.", "YTA. It's totally fair game to think that (and your comparison is not wrong). However, saying it out loud is not productive to the conversation nor is it kind to your aunt. There is no shortage of situations where you will be asked to comment on a subject you will find uninteresting or uncute, but will be of great importance to those around you. Generally speaking making negative comments about appearances isn't going to go over well. And at the end of the day, \"telling the truth\" doesn't matter in this situation. (Like would you feel the urge to tell your aunt that if she had adopted a three legged kitty from the shelter that the cat was \\[some negative descriptor\\] because he was missing a leg?) Your opinion of cuteness doesn't matter here. You aren't pointing out that the emperor has no clothes.", "NTA. That's hilarious \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA, this is just funny lmfao", "NTA. I own one and am part of the community on reddit and Facebook and a lot of sphynx owners make the joke themselves as well as calling them chickens or turkeys (idk how many pics of sphynxes in metal pans like a turkey I saw last fall) like we know they look funny ESPECIALLY as kittens. They do grow peachfuzz when theyre older. It varies as far as how much and where but mine has orange fur covering his face and ears, a fully coated tail, and boots. :)", "YTA. She was excited. She got a new pet. You could've just changed the subject or stfu. And you certainly shouldn't have said that sh*t in front of a little girl.\n\nYou wanted to go for a laugh and embarrass your aunt and shut her up and that's what you did. If I were her I wouldn't invite you over again.\n\nAnd you did all this because you prefer rescue cats to an expensive cat that you didn't pay for and don't have to take care of. You literally just wanted burst her bubble and sh*t on her parade. Yeah, you're the asshole.", "NTA. Don't want to hear the answer, don't ask the question. And thanks for the laugh, I just did a spit take with my coffee when I read this. \ud83e\udd23", "YTA. That wasn't appropriate to say in front of the younger kids and you know it. \n\nIf your aunt had adopted a one eyed orange kitten with mange, she still would have thought it was the most beautiful cat she's ever seen because she's excited about her new pet and wants to share her joy with her family.\n\n It was one dinner. You couldn't even act happy for her for one dinner.", "NTA. Accurate.", "LOLOLOL Nta. She wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it and asking your thoughts.", "NTA\nthey do", "I googled sphinx kittens and can confirm scrotum resemblance.  NTA.", "NTA bc it\u2019s true! Lmao!", "NTA, at least you didn't say a pair of shorn balls.", "Yta.. is there a reason to be crude when your annoyed? Were you raised with manners?", "NTA. Also if your mom said exactly that, then she thinks you are TA just for saying the word \"scrotum\" and not for saying that about the cat (probably because there was a kid at the table, manners, whatever). So I guess she lowkey agrees with you lol", "NTA. I have a smoosh faced cat (exotic shorthair) and I'm aware it's not everyone's cup of tea. My friends constantly tease me about how he looks like the diabeetus meme, he cost too much money, etc. It doesn't bother me. I know they're not saying those things maliciously (and I agree with them on the diabeetus guy lol). Your aunt needs to get over herself. I LOVELOVELOVE cats and even I call Sphinx cats naked mole rats despite finding them cute lol.", "Biggest mistake was not taking a picture of kitten first so we could make a comparison.  I would have given you a fortune to explain to younger child what a scrotum was just to see Aunts reaction and your Mom have to scold you while laughing inside. Honestly I think you could be related to my family\u2026 well done.", "NAH\u2014 if you'd said it unprompted or she hadn't been repeatedly asking you about how cute the cat was they yeah you'd be ta, but as it was you responded to harassment with a joke.\n\ni feel like if I were your aunt I would have been mildly offended on the cat's behalf\u2014 while laughing my ass off.", "NTA.\n\nI love animals, but god damn that doesn't mean they have to be annoying about a new pet.\n\nPlus I agree: adopt don't shop.", "Nta it was a joke and should be taken like one", "YTA for the comparison and exceptionally accurate and articulate word choice.  Condemnation aside, this is hilarious as shown by your cousin's and uncle's reactions.", "NTA, she kept asking and you gave an honest answer. If she didn't want the truth she wouldn't have asked", "NTA just because I think they look hideous, lol. And kind of scary.", "NTA. You just called it like you see it. And that comparison is hilarious. Thanks for the laugh. P.S. try calling the cat Mr. Scrotum from now on. Or little ballsy, or nutbag. Lol. Sounds like your uncle would be in on the fun too. Lmao", "NTA This is priceless", "YTA. It would have cost you $0.00 to keep your mouth shut.", "YTA. \n\nYou think expensive pets are a waste of money so you decided to try to ruin your aunt's enjoyment of her cat by being childish, nasty, and insulting.", "NTA \ud83d\ude02", "Meh, while it might not have been your best moment, I guess it will be forgiven. I usually try to not make any negative comments about things that people are excited about even it they look ridiculous.", "NTA. You probably shouldn't have said that in front of a little girl though.", "NTA, landlady had one, close friend has 2.  WE ALL AGREE they look like scrotums", "Haha NTA. I feel the same way about those cats.", "Them looking like a scrotum is literally what appealed to me, it\u2019s hilarious considering naming one ballsack \u201cBS\u201d one day", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
