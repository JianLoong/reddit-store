I think it's time you relearn that saying because what you said was way off base.  Doesn't matter what you think, but words hurt.

It's totally fair game to think that (and your comparison is not wrong). However, saying it out loud is not productive to the conversation nor is it kind to your aunt. There is no shortage of situations where you will be asked to comment on a subject you will find uninteresting or uncute, but will be of great importance to those around you. Generally speaking making negative comments about appearances isn't going to go over well. And at the end of the day, \"telling the truth\" doesn't matter in this situation. (Like would you feel the urge to tell your aunt that if she had adopted a three legged kitty from the shelter that the cat was \\[some negative descriptor\\] because he was missing a leg?)

That verges far too close to, \"You're too sensitive, just learn to take a joke\" for me. \n\nLike, the joke here was literally just the aunt loving and being excited about her new cat and wanting to show it off. Does that sound funny to you? I get that she was being overbearing and annoying about it, but actually think about the context and OP's punchline here.\n\nIf you were trying to talk about something new you had that you really, really loved and were super excited about, and someone just went, \"It's ugly and stupid\" and started talking about something else, would *you* be laughing? Or would you feel hurt because they just crapped all over your joy and enthusiasm for no reason other than because that joy and enthusiasm was annoying them? \n\n>I feel like getting actually offended by this is a little silly honestly. \n\nThere's a big difference between someone trying to crack a joke and someone saying something with the clear intention of just shutting you down.

If op said that the aunt looked like a scrotum that would be one thing but this is her opinion and she is certainly allowed to have one.", "That's nicer than how many friends/siblings greet each other tbh.", "That's so sad for you, and a super weird take - nobody said anything about teaching the child about sex. When I parent my young child alone, if I need to pee he's going to be right there in the bathroom with me. Same deal when my partner parents our young child alone. The child also bathes and showers with us because it isn't safe or practical for them to do it alone all of the time.", "That's the excuse, and it's a good one.

But I get why you might think they\u2019re the same. I also don\u2019t really follow the idea that the comment was to make the aunt shut up or shut down her joy. I think it was just annoyance at being asked the same question over and over. I don\u2019t believe OP\u2019s intention was so nefarious, it was just someone (who is probably younger) feeling annoyed and responding as such. But I do get what you\u2019re saying.", "From the sound of it they were polite about it up to that point. And I honestly just don\u2019t think the comment is that mean.

The simplest thing to do would be to apologize and move on. Not create a whole post about it. It\u2019s really such a small thing to cause so much drama over", "Then wear a swimsuit or something. There's no need to be naked in front of your young children and teach them about your naked body. Call it as weird or sad as you want, I really don't care", "Really? What poison got efficiently expunged here? The poison of OP's aunt's love for and excitement about her new cat? \n\nIf the \"poison\" was OP and Co's annoyance at the aunt's raving about the cat nonstop--okay. OP cured the poison of their irritation by poisoning their aunt's excitement and love for her new cat. OP gets to feel better because they poisoned their aunt and made *her* feel worse. Does that really seem like the most reasonable and healthiest solution to you? When there was a just-as-easy solution that resulted in *no one* being poisoned at all? Do you usually get poison out by just stabbing it into someone else and then walking away? Or do you usually draw it out/dissolve it gently so as not to cause further damage? Because both medicially *and* metaphorically speaking, it's the latter. \n\nYour metaphor sounds clever on paper, I'll give you that, but it doesn't actually work with the stance that you're defending.", ">Saying a cat looks like a scrotum is very different from calling a person ugly.\n\nYou're right, its different. Most cat owners would prefer being called ugly themselves rather than their cat being called names. \n\nYou call me fat and ugly? That's your opinion. You insult my cat? Gtfo before I hurt you. \n\nAlso, if you love someone you don't throw sparky and insulting comments for something they are excited about and clearly care for very much, even if they get a little annoying. At most you ask them to stop asking you the same question you've answered 20 times.", "The poison is whatever compelled them to insult someone in the first place. Just because it makes you feel better doesn't mean you should do it.", "Neither are appropriate... both are asshole moves."]}
