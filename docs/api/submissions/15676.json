Her hair was a lot like his. It's super curly. Because of this our mom did a lot to maintain it. Growing up, mom would spend hours on my sister's hair, and each morning was dedicated to the two of them in bathroom, with my sister screaming and crying because brushing through it was long and unpleasant. Up until she was 13, mom insisted on washing and styling my sister's hair. She never let her cut it or dye it. When someone suggested getting it trimmed they were kicked out of the house. I won't lie, mom was controlling at times but I thought we all knew it was because of grief and memory of our dad.\n\nWell mom died and the first thing my sister did was get her hair chopped incredibly short and dyed. She sent myself and my siblings a picture of her new haircut, with the caption 'Sharon (our mom) always said I was going to grow my hair down to my butt...Not anymore'.  I thought it was my sister's way of grieving but now she mentions it a lot, like asking how pissed do I think mom would be if she saw my hair this short.\n\nI told her after the 5th comment to stop acting like her haircut was a big achievement, it's not, millions of people get haircuts and she should know her hair was important to mom because it reminded her of dad.

It's normal as hell. And your sister has been denied that perfectly normal option for her whole life. Give her a f\\*cking break.\n\nYTA.", "I grew up in a church where women don\u2019t cut their hair. I hated my hair. It went all the way down to my belt and it was thick, heavy, and hot. Pull it up to get it off my neck and I got a headache. Leave it down to prevent headache and get sweaty and tangled. \n\nOne of the first things I did after leaving home was cut it off and die it. I chose jet black. I couldn\u2019t wait to get away from a false image I\u2019d been forced to portray for so many years. \n\nI\u2019m going to say YTA because you likely can\u2019t begin to understand what that\u2019s like. Having your own hair be a prison. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be sympathetic and supportive. If you can\u2019t be those two things, why would she want you in her life?", "YTA. Hun, it wasn't just controlling; your mother was abusive. Torturing a kid like this (for something that's not medical) is absolutely traumatizing. I wasn't allowed to cut my hair until I was in the first grade. It was ALREADY below my butt. I was a little kid sitting on my own fucking hair. Finally, my father is the one who said \"if she wants to cut it, she should be allowed to cut it\". I went in with >2 feet of growth and came out with a bowl cut (was the only name of a short hair cut I knew). It absolutely was a fucking accomplishment.", "YTA\n\nYour Mother was controlling, your sister is just celebrating the freedom she has now\n\nYour Mother mourning your Father may be an explanation, but it isn't an excuse.", "YTA\n\nHow about some empathy?\n\nYour sister was traumatized by your mother, who essentially abused you. She has finally found freedom and you can't be happy with her.\n\nThe jealousy just oozes from this post. You see your sister as the golden child. She's a victim.", "YTA. You obviously understand this isn't just someone getting a haircut. You understand why it's a big deal. Sure a large volume of comments from her might get annoying but again, you know why. \n\nTo be fair, it's a soft y t a because I'm sure you're also grieving, and that can bring out the AH in anyone. Sorry for your loss.", "YTA, but I can understand why you don't understand. \n\nYour sister had a very different childhood that you did. She was abused, and your mother indoctrinated you to think that there was nothing wrong with what she was doing to your sister. \n\nBrushing a child's hair is not abusive in isolation. But your mother took it to an excess that definitely was. This wasn't something she had to do for hygiene or maintenance purposes. \n\nDeep, daily brushing of curly hair will actually damage it. Preventing her from cutting it to remove the damaged bits is even worse because that just made the entire mess more prone to tangles, knots and pain. Your mom wasn't doing your sister any favors.\n\nSpeaking as a child who had a super sensitive scalp? I'd have rather been spanked every day that have my hair brushed. It was torture. My mother eventually gave up and let me deal with it...when I was six. I grew out of the scalp pain as a teenager, but even brushing my own hair was agony. I eventually settled on finger combing unless there was a really bad tangle.\n\nYour sister said your mom treated her like a doll. That's not a healthy or acceptable way to express grief. If you want to dedicate your own hair as a memorial to your dead loved one, that's fine. But parents need to respect the bodily autonomy of their children and teach them how to make good decisions about their bodies and what other people are allowed to do to them. \n\nYou don't do that by controlling everything about a child's appearance until they're 13 and making them think that they don't deserve to choose what happens to their own body.\n\nYour sister called your mom by her name. Children who love their parents don't do that.\n\nYou might love your mom, but your sister probably doesn't. Your sister is celebrating her final and ultimate freedom from her abuser who tormented and controlled her all her life.\n\nI mean this next part in the kindest way possible: I encourage you to find yourself a good therapist and talk through everything your mother did to both your sister and you. You're grieving her, so therapy is a good idea. But you likely have a lot of warped perceptions about how your mother treated you that are not healthy, and you aren't even aware of that fact. You need to do some serious reflection on your childhood, and you need help to do it so someone can help you see what parts were unhealthy and what parts were genuinely good.", "YTA.\n\nYour sister is empowering herself and dealing with her childhood trauma and you're not only shaming her for that, you're trying to take on the role of your mother and compound and trigger her trauma. You're not being a good person or a good sister right now.", "YTA. You don't get it, do you? Your sister is free. This is big for her. Hard as it is to accept, your mother's 'controlling' behaviour wasn't on. Your sister is finally getting to express herself, even 'rebel' a little - that absolutely should be celebrated.", "I had my haircut this week. 14 inches. I cried when they cut it. They thought it was because I regretted it. I cried because I didn\u2019t realise how much trauma was wrapped up in that hair, how much it weighed me down mentally and physically. \nI\u2019m adjusting to my new very short hair. I feel very self conscious. I am both unsure it suits and happy it\u2019s gone. It changes day to day. \nFortunately those in my life have been great. They know it\u2019s not about the hair as a new chapter that I hope is a great one and by giving me thumbs up about my hair, they are supporting me. It\u2019s great to get going on a positive note as the future can feel overwhelming. \n\nShame you couldn\u2019t do that for your sister. \nYTA.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t cut my hair because I forced to keep it long. I experienced a lot of different trauma and during that period found it difficult to care for myself. It grew and grew through it all. I can only imagine how liberating it must feel if that trauma was directly linked to my hair.", "YTA.   \nYou even acknowledge the crap your sister went thru at the hands of your mom controlling her hair for her own selfish reasons - and you don't see the liberation your sister must feel finally escaping it to become her own person with her own hair preferences? Come on.  Support your sister - cheer her on instead of not acting like it is a big deal because you got to do whatever you wanted without that crap.", "YTA\n\nYour mom was very unhealthy towards your sister and her hair and you invalided her feelings.", "YTA\n\nYour mother treated your sister like her own personal bereavement doll. Your sister is now free of the expectation and the pain - literal and figurative - of being a living, breathing homage to her father\u2019s memory for your mom \n\nShe\u2019s been denied a haircut her entire life.

Show her some encouragement.  It doesn't appear that she ever got it from Sharon.", "YTA\n\nYour mom tho in pain inflicted a LOT of harm to your sister. \n\nShe's not going to just get over it. It's going to be a thing until it's not.", "YTA. You were blind to the suffering your mom put your sister through, nor do I doubt you even knew the extent of it. Just because you had a wildly different relationship with your mom, (maybe consider its partially because you knew your dad, and she did not, so the coping wasn't necessary for her and made her feel used) does NOT give you the right to invalidate the one your sister had with her.", "INFO: Were you granted bodily autonomy and that's why you don't understand why it's so important to people who were deprived of it?", "YTA, it\u2019s lifelong trauma for her", "YTA. Your mom was emotionally abusive to your sister and it manifested in control over her hair. Her grief is not an excuse for that extremely toxic behavior. I\u2019m proud and happy for your sister for breaking free and finally wearing her hair how she wants it and you should be too. At least you\u2019ve made it clear to her that you aren\u2019t a safe person to process your mother mother\u2019s abuse with.", "It was a big achievement for your sister and you know it and you know YTA. Hope it was worth it.", "YTA.\n\nNo matter your mom's reasons or intentions, that was abuse on your sister and she's finally free from it. You don't get to shit on her just because her way of expressing relief is annoying to you.", "Soft YTA - it *is* a big achievement for her. What you described as her childhood is straight up traumatic - having no agency over your own body to such an extreme degree is bad enough, but it was also saddling her with a HUGE burden - \"I miss your dad, so instead of dealing with that grief in healthy ways, you get to represent him for me and if you fail to do that you will receive my wrath.\" That is a terrible thing to do to a child.\n\nThe relief she must feel being able to make decisions about *her* body, it's clearly life-changing. Honestly, throw her a party, celebrate the shit out of her unburdening herself like that! Then look inwards and see if there are ways you could unburden yourself as well, because I bet ya got a few.", "YTA, though not a huge one. I understand why it isn't a big achievement *to you*, but try to see it from your sister's point of view. Her entire life, she's had no control over a part of her own body. Now she does, and is exercising that new found freedom. I assure you, it's a *really* big deal to her.", "YTA majorly\n\nYour mother abused your sister for years/decades, tortured her, took away her autonomy over her body and when your sister got her freedom you're telling her it's nothing?

Especially if shes just getting to now. What your mother did was not healthy for her or your sister and the fact that you play down the pain is concerning.

Especially as a kid when you have tangles.

Even if you say you didn\u2019t notice it that\u2019s 100% abusive behavior.

Sometimes a haircut IS a big achievement. Just because millions of people get their haircut every day, doesn't mean it isn't a huge personal achievement for someone.

Cutting it is a huge step, it is taking back autonomy that she never got to have.", "YTA. Your sister is recovering from trauma and having control over her own hair is a big step for her.

You have the same issue your mother had, you think your sister should be OK with suffering just because of grief.", "It was incredibly abusive of your mother to deny her daughter bodily autonomy, putting her through pain daily, and then emotionally manipulating her to keep her hair long.

She was abusive (as your mom was to your sister but you\u2019re in denial about that even though idk how making a child suffer to the point of tears daily isn\u2019t abuse to you?).

I can understand her view from a different point. I'm nonbinary and had long hair all my life because I grew up in a more conservative household. I was told all my life the typical conservative Christian things (being gay is a sin, you'll go to hell for it, etc etc). I have *ever* felt cisgender in my life. It wasn't until my school had a GSA that I learned nonbinary was even a *thing*. \n\nAfter I graduated, I said \"fuck it\" and chopped my hair off into even shorter than a pixie cut. I felt *obligated* to keep my hair long for my mom's sake. But being a new adult and finally understanding my identity...I embraced it.\n\nThis is *very* similar to what your sister is going through. For her, she's expressing an identity that she *never* got to have as a child due to an abusive/controlling mother. \n\nIf somebody in my life told me I couldn't cut my hair because I was supposed to be female, I would be absolutely *furious*. That's what your sister is thinking and feeling. She's not somebody's doll.

It sounds like she needed to do it.", "YTA. My grandma didn\u2019t let my mom cut her hair either, so when my mom moved out, she chopped most of her hair off.

I mean the group text to your siblings about your mom/her haircut, especially right after she passed, kinda feels a little tone deaf, but you understood this was her way of reacting to your moms death, and I think she was reflecting on their relationship too, and anger can be a big part of grief. But after a few times mentioning, she must\u2019ve seen how your reaction wasn\u2019t exactly the same as hers. And if you can respect her grieving process, why can\u2019t she respect yours? Maybe she has unfinished business with your mom, but it\u2019s selfish of her to want you to join in on her post-mortem-rebellion if you had a good relationship with your mom and don\u2019t feel the same way she did.

It\u2019s a big part of who we are. One of the first things people tend to do when they\u2019re trying to move on from a chapter of their lives is get a new hairstyle.

I would consider apologizing for it and explaining yourself but also keep in mind that you shouldn\u2019t beat yourself up about it too much.", "YTA, and I sympathize greatly with your sister. While my mom didn't do anything with my hair, she was obsessed with the whole \"long hair is for girls\" thing, and she hated seeing short hair on girls. She actively told me this any time I thought about wanting my hair cut a bit shorter, berating me for wanting to \"look like a boy\" when that had nothing to do with the issue. The issue was I hated how long my hair was and how much of a pain it was to keep clean and straight. I was able to sit on my hair for the largest portion of my childhood, it was that long. I learned eventually her issues came from her mom forcing her to cut her hair really short and she hated it, but instead of handling it through therapy (like she should've, but unfortunately she was one of those \"therapy is for crazy people\" types), she projected her trauma onto me. Which sounds exactly like what your mom did to your sister. Instead of processing the trauma of your father's death through healthier means, she took it out on your sister. Your mother was wrong for that, and what she did was abusive. You may not want to think so, but that is the truth of the matter. Controlling someone in the way that she did your sister is abuse.  \n\n\nIt was actually both sad and liberating when I got my hair cut for the first time after my mom's passing. When I was about 12/13, I had my hair cut short not because of my own choice but because I got lice and it was impossible to rid it all from my longer hair. And it actually felt so amazing having my hair cut at that time, seeing all of that long hair gone and I had my hair at my shoulders. My mom saw how happy I was with the short hair, despite her issues, and we came to the agreement of allowing me one hair cut a year. Which I accepted at the time as a kid, but kept up with it as an adult because if I had kept my hair permanently short like what I wanted I'd never hear the end to the comments and complaints that she made every time my hair was cut. But when I got my hair cut for the first time after her passing, I felt sad because I knew she would have a comment, but also liberated because I didn't have to hear it. I no longer had to follow that agreement, I could have my hair as short as I wanted. And I did.  \n\n\nSounds like your sister is finally feeling like she can be free to have her hair be what she wanted it to be, to be the person she wanted to be, that your mother would allow her to be. And good for her, because it's a very good feeling when you finally feel like you're out of the grip of a controlling parent and allowed to be your own person, not whatever it was they wanted you to be. I hope that you are able to come to understand that, while you two were living under the same roof, you lived in entirely different worlds and that your sister holds none of the sentiments that you do towards your mother. And I hope you learn that, while you love your mother, she was not a good person towards your sister and instead of continuing to be disparaging towards your sister as she's now experiencing freedom from her abuser, you respect her feelings all the same.", "YTA- So your mom put your sister through physical pain for 17 years, and you don't think that is abusive behavior?

OP needs to realize that cutting her hair is a big deal for their sister because she was constantly abused and that just because OP wasn't subjected to this abuse and OP's mother provided for them (and probably loved them both in her own twisted way) that it doesn't mean she wasn't abusive. If OP truly had a better relationship with her mother they probably see their sister's comments as \"haha I'm so glad mom is dead\" while they might actively still be actively grieving over their death. OP being older probably also has some memories of their mom before their father's death and these may be clouding the image of what their mom actually became.

I have a friend who grieved their truly awful abusive alcoholic mother's death beacuse \"she was my Mom\". \n\nSister may have a legitimate beef with Mom but Mom is dead. Mom can't see or hear anything Sister is doing. Whether or not Mom deserved to be told off isn't relevant, since Mom is gone and Mom isn't who Sister is talking to. The question here is whether or not Sister should keep using OP to try and indirectly tell off someone who can no longer hear her when it hurts OP.\n\nSister's reaction to mom's death was to send her siblings all a message saying \"look, Mom was wrong and I don't care what she thinks!\" And while that's a legitimate take for sister to have, it's not very empathic of her either to choose *her grieving siblings* as the ones to tell this to. A friend, therapist, or complete stranger would have been a more empathic choice. But I can excuse the first time. Or the second. Maybe the third. But sister KEEPS bringing this up to OP. She's not telling OP how happy she is with her hair now or anything. Nope, what she keeps telling OP is think about how upset your recently deceased mothers would be if she could see me now! It's a clear \"F our dead Mom!\" from OP's sister, made repeatedly to OP as OP grieves their mother's death.\n\nWhether or not you think OP's Mom deserves the \"F you\" Sister is making them to someone else (OP) who her comments are hurt.\n\nSo ESH I guess. OP could be more empathic to her sister, but her sister behavior is completely lacking in empathy as well. I can't tell if OP's sister somehow dosen't realize that this is hurtful to OP and keeps repeating these comments again and again hoping that this will magically be the time she gets whatever reaction she is looking for, or she knows it hurts OP's feelings and that's the point. Maybe she is misplacing her anger onto OP since she's still here to make feel bad? Or maybe she dosen't think Mom deserves grieving and it annoyed OP is acting sad Mom died so is trying to punish her? Or maybe she just wants attention and to be told \"Yeah, Mom would be *pissssed,* you sure showed her!\" from her grieving siblings (and despite the fact it's too late to show Mom anything) and is too self-absorbed to notice or care how they feel?\n\nBut whatever Sister's motivation here, it's not productive or kind.", "It\u2019s not that - not letting her cut it would be controlling but not abuse.

It was about the trauma she experienced as a result of your mother's abuse, and for her, cutting her hair was a huge way of reclaiming herself from your mother. \n\nHowever, may trauma and abuse survivors tend to gaslight or doubt themselves as a result of the trauma and even when they are making what is obviously the right decision, they need a lot of reassurance that they didn't screw up or make the wrong decision.\n\nSometimes it's also about simply seeking validation of their experience, which may be the case with your sister here. She needs you to reassure and validate her that your mom would be pissed that she cut her hair, because what's she's really asking for is validation that your mother was abusive, and that you as her sibling recognize that and that your mother's abuse didn't simply go unnoticed and thus, forgotten. \n\nStuff like this is really complex and difficult for trauma and abuse survivors to articulate. It seems like this may have been the only way she knew how. \n\nYou telling her that \"she should know her hair was important to mom because it reminded her of dad\" was one of the worst possible things you could have said, because instead of being there for your sister, you perpetuated your mother's abuse, excused it, and minimized the trauma your sister experienced.\n\nOther comments have covered other points quite well.

It should be combed while wet with a wide tooth comb and that's it. \n\nEven still, when I and my sisters were little, my parents would braid our hair at night after a shower so it didn't get tangled overnight.

Her sister is looking for some fucking acknowledgement from her siblings that what she went through was terrible and she wants to celebrate the death of her abuser -and the symbolic cutting of her hair to signify that toxic person\u2019s exit- with people who are supposed to love and support her. She is looking to be validated that what she went through was awful, she wants to talk about it and be heard and she wants to feel the relief of rejoicing in her mother\u2019s death with people who she loves.

OP thinks of her mother\u2019s physically and emotionally abusive behavior as having been valid because her mom was grieving, but apparently she cannot extend that same empathy to the sister who was *abused* and who -unlike her mom- is not even causing any actual harm to anyone because she can\u2019t see past her own current grief for her mother (huh, seems to be a family trait\u2026)\n\nIf sister *is* angry at her I wouldn\u2019t even call that anger \u201cmisplaced\u201d because OP is being an apologist for her mothers abuse. OP seems to have been very comfortable in their cushy role as a child who was not the target for the abusive a parent. Her sister kept bringing it up because she was hoping that now their mom is dead her sister could acknowledge their mothers toxicity which is VITAL when it comes to healing a family from an abusive household. You cannot connect with someone who excuses your abuse. OP just showed her sister that she\u2019s still on their moms side.

I actually have wavy blonde hair, but my mom forced me to keep it long even though I wanted it short. It was naturally bleach blonde and past my butt as a kid. We would fight and she would brush it aggressively. She would insist on doing incredibly time consuming elaborate hair styles that were incredibly painful. If I cried she would smack my head with the hair brush hard enough to leave welts which was super painful with the tight hair styles. I would cry and beg to cut it and she\u2019d say FINE and then guilt me about it until I cried and begged her not to cut it. As soon as I was 14 I saved up money and went to a salon and cut it all off. It was such a freeing moment in my life.", "Same!

Trauma stew. She'll work through it, and her sister could be more supportive. \n\nMeanwhile, OP is working through her own grief and maybe some guilt at all the freedom she had or some weird jealousy because she wasn't the focus of her mother's attention. So another confused, conflicted, and possibly traumatized sibling.  They need to support each other, acknowledge the good and the bad, and move on in life as healthy and happy young women.", "This is very true. My sister was the favorite child. They went on a family cruise while I was in college. They didn't ask me if I wanted to go. Instead they asked me if I would get their mail", "Preach.", "She told her sister off because her sister keeps bringing it up to people who seemingly don\u2019t wanna hear it especially after there mother died. OP is NTA but her sister is for hurting OP by thinking she can use her as a way to get back at their abusive mother who\u2019s now dead. The same mom OP is clearly grieving for. That\u2019s pretty fucked up.", "This one right here.\n\nThe sister keeps bringing it up because she wants someone -- ANYONE -- to acknowledge that she has control now. She wants someone to confirm that her abuser would have hated it and can't do anything about it, that she has power over the phantom that hangs over her at last.\n\nE: One thing OP needs to acknowledge here is that their sister was three years old when their father passed, and grief turned their mother into an abusive monster soon after. The human brain starts recording recallable memories around then. Almost the entirety of her memories of her mother are that of a cruel abuser who turned her into a twisted effigy of her late father, for whom she has very few memories, if any. Sure, she may have positive memories of her mother, but it's important to remember that her mother and her abuser are two entities that inhabited the same body. When OP defends their mother's mistreatment of their sister, in her mind they're not defending her *mother*, they're defending her *abuser*.", "That\u2019s awful. I\u2019m sorry.", "Absolutely. Did she design some pretty dresses? Sure! Were her designs likely spread further and a lot more popular because she was a vehement antisemite who informed on others - directly leading to their deaths and torture,  used her romantic connections to Nazi officers for her own personal gain and lived a life of luxury because of it?

I mean, we range from olive to sheet white. I just have curly hair.\n\nYes, OP's mother was abusive, and OP, YTA.

Someone who won\u2019t be feeling some type of way about it. \n\nIdk I just think you should both be more sensitive to one another and how you\u2019re each processing your mother\u2019s death and all that comes with it.", "NTA\n\nYour sister shouldn't have been the doll for your grieving mother. Big burden to carry. Totally agree with the others in that regard.\n\nRepeatedly asking how angry your mother (Sharon) would be sounds like your sister wants you to join her in her hatred of your mother. That's a bridge too far. Your sister's giving you a false choice. \n\nAgain, I recognize the emotional burden the mother placed on your sister. Now that your mother is deceased, she's free to cut her hair. Good for her. The burden is lifted. She should be happy, but she's exacting vengeance on her mistaken mother. It's not good for her psychologically and it's against the 10 Commandments (Honor your mother and father... Not rail on about their shortcomings, but respect them in their humanity).\n\nI also know a young lady with a mother that she only refers to as Sharon. I saw Sharon a few months ago and nobody in that family can understand why the young lady hates her mother so much. From my gleanings talking to the young lady, her mother made mistakes. But don't we all, especially as parents?\n\nI hope your sister enjoys her new freedom while recognizing that her mother was an imperfect person and that she doesn't have to hold hatred at the same time she's relishing her freedom and expect you to join in with her.", "YTA\n\n> I won't lie, mom was controlling at times but I thought we all knew it was because of grief and memory of our dad\n\nWho's \"we\"? Because your 3-yo sister didn't fucking \"know\" your mom became unhealthily fixated on her hair over her grief. All she knew was that she going to be tortured apparently every fucking morning, according to *your own words*.\n\n> each morning was dedicated to the two of them in bathroom, with my sister screaming and crying because brushing through it was long and unpleasant.\n\nThat's abuse, full stop. It's ridiculous that you can write that out and yet fail to see how that was torture for your sister.\n\n> Up until she was 13, mom insisted on washing and styling my sister's hair. \n\nAgain, DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF??? Your sister was a preteen and she **couldn't even shower alone** because your mother was obsessive! \n\nWhy is your mom washing this grown child's hair??? That's absolutely ridiculous and you need to get your head out of where it doesn't belong to recognize that this behavior was mental.\n\n> Sharon (our mom) always said I was going to grow my hair down to my butt...Not anymore'\n\nAnd this takes the cake: your sister used your mother's **name** instead of saying \"mom\", and you still can't figure out how fucked up your sister is because of your mother???\n\n> I thought it was my sister's way of grieving\n\nIt was your sister's way of *celebrating* the fact that she is now free from your mother's control. It should speak *volumes* to you that that was her first impulse.\n\nI'm sorry you lost your mom; apparently things were much better for you because you lucked out and didn't have dad's hair, but your sister suffered for *years* under her control and you are completely insensitive to her trauma. That's awful and you should really think through all of this.", "No assholes here, only traumatized children.\n\nOP desperately needs to sit down with a councilor and unpack why he normalizes a child screaming and crying in pain for hours every day. There is no way witnessing this abuse didn't affect his mental health, also.", "Uhhh yta", "YTA\nYou just described your mother abusing your sister daily and controlling her body. Breaking free of that is an achievement..", "YTA. \n\nThis isn't \"just a haircut\" for your sister. For her, it's the final way she is breaking that continual abuse cycle that she endured with your mother for years. To her, the accomplishment isn't cutting her hair. The accomplishment is finally telling your mother NO, even if she is doing so screaming at the sky. Even if your sister's hair reminded your mom of your dad, the way she treated your sister doesn't sound like a loving parent who misses their spouse and who does on the child who reminds them of that spouse. It sounds like the complete opposite to me. It sounds to me like your mother was enraged with your father if your sister's hair was indeed the continued representation of your father in your mother's life. Her ripping a brush through that hair while your sister screamed bloody murder doesn't sound like she loved that hair. It sounds to me like she hated that hair... and likely your dad as well.\n\nBut yes, YTA in this. Your sister is looking for you to acknowledge the ABUSE she endured, and she is probably looking for a sincere apology from you for not helping her get away from your mother. If you want to have a good relationship, or any relationship, with your sister from this point forward, you're going to need to first apologize big time for being an insensitive prick regarding your comment of it not being a big deal. Then you're going to need to acknowledge the years, decades of pain your sister endured, and apologize again for not helping her get out of it. You probably didn't really understand what was going on as a kid, but now is the time to validate your sister's feelings about all of this and let her know that you are on her side and that you'll do everything within your power and on the right side of the law to protect her from the point further.\n\nOf course, as with everything, don't say shit unless you absolutely mean it 100%. Women can see through 99.9% of a man's BS at all times. We just usually don't say anything because we have a background plot or motive going on of which you are most likely blissfully unaware.\n\nJust say it if you mean it, man. Say it if you mean it. It will likely do wonders for your sister's recovery, assuming she is in rehab or CBT with a licensed therapist.", "ESH. You for snapping at your sister and disregarding years of control and manipulation she suffered at the hands of your mom. Your mom for doing that to her. Her for rubbing your mother's death in your face as though you should be happy about it.

But all of it should be forgiven because this is two people who are dealing with trauma in different ways. Death sucks. The death of your parents is hard. It's esp hard when you're losing your 2ND parent. \nYour sister sucks because nobody else should be expected or asked to celebrate in her rebellion against your mom's wishes in her absence. People often deal with someone's death by wanting to honor their wishes in extreme ways, or maybe in small ways, but to the utmost way they are capable of doing. Maybe you are one of those people who lean more to the side of honoring people by continuing to do things they wanted done, even without having them there to enforce it. You're thinking about your mom as a human, who was flawed and who, in her lifetime, did her own mourning and handled it the same way you have- by honoring something your Dad might have liked- seeing himself in his daughter. That's okay. That's a healthy way to grieve in the way you are doing it. Your sister should respect it, so, for that reason, you NTA. She is. I think hers is a really immature response, and maybe one that she really isn't as comfortable with as she likes to think she is; which is why she keeps trying to seek validation from others. \n\nBut here's why YTA- she's your YOUNGER sister. You admit that this part of their relationship may have highlighted some less than flattering traits your mom had..that it was a source of contention for your sister for her ENTIRE life. You could be more understanding. You could give her the same empathy you're extending to your late mother in how she grieved your dad/her husband. That doesn't mean you can't have boundaries. You still needed to tell her that you're not interested in validating her decision with her hair. But you could have done it in a different way. All you had to say was (or coukd say moving forward is); \n\"I know how Mom was over your hair and I have my own feelings about why and gow it happened, and honestly it just makes me even sadder to think about. I don't mind being in the same room with your new hair but please, I'm asking you to refrain from mentioning it and/ or asking me to comment on it right now. I just don't want to give my opinion; and I don't want to hear anymore about Moms opinion on it, or what you're assuming it would have been if she could actually see it vs hearing about the idea. Mom loved your looks and woukd have thought you were beautiful no matter what. She might have even surprised you and shared in your love of it. You'll never know. I'll never know. But I don't want to think about it either way.\" \n\nThe two of your are bonded in life, now in at least two losses. Give one another some grace and forgive one anothers short comings as each of you to maneuver through grief In the best way that each of you are capable of. I hope it works out for the best, and that neither of you will be quick to dismiss the other, their feelings, etc moving forward.  Barring extreme situations and truly toxic relationships- siblings need to cling one another following the death of parents. They will become increasingly important to you now. No one can replace the people who were with you as you developed into who you are- the people who shared in those same shapings, who understands why and gow you've become who you are; the person who shares memories of things you'll look to have validated later on and have no one to ask but them, etc. \nWhen we die, we've spent only part of our lives with our spouse and children. They arent there for the first psrt of our lives. Our parents are there for the first part of our lives, but not the last. When we go, it's our siblings who have shared more of our experience and life than ANYONE else. Cherish it. \nI lost the parents and have since lost BOTH of my siblings, and I'm not even 40 years old. Everyone from my formative years is gone. Yall forgive each other and love each other and as I said before, extend grace to one another as much as possible.", "NotTAH... Your sister has an  issue.

OP it sounds like you and your sister had different relationships with your mom and your grief is a lot different from hers. Clearly this isn\u2019t just about the haircut. The haircut is a representation of her reclaiming the freedom and control your mom stole from her. She probably needs to have the abuse and mistreatment she suffered acknowledged by you and your siblings. She\u2019s also TA for rubbing your mom\u2019s death in your face.

Making sense doesn\u2019t mean something is right so I hope OP can process this and stop behaving this way, but I hope that approaching it from a place of understanding will help them on that path. I truly don\u2019t believe that a parent can abuse only one child because at the very least it requires teaching the rest of the children a warped enough way of thinking that they can deny that what\u2019s going on is abnormal", "There's also another detail here that people might be missing.\n\nWhile this is a win for the younger sister and it's all good that she values having gotten out of this situation, isn't it also the case the younger is now drilling down to OP in a sense that, hey, look, now that Sharon is dead, I'm free to do what I want with my hair, which is fine, but the repeated pings and taunts to someone who's already grieving can also mean she's partly blaming the elder sister for the previous trauma and so the flexing about the haircut is purposefully being done to hint at this. Because there's no need to keep talking of the same thing, a simple message and photo would suffice and both can lead their lives happily.\n\nHere the younger is choosing to taunt the elder with the haircut as a tool and a grieving person's counter to stop this behaviour makes her the total AH? This is just dishonest because even the elder sister needs time to process that it was indeed abusive tendencies by their mother and to digest that it takes time, and that can only be possible when the younger also patiently sits down and talks it out to share her woes that haven't come out till then. Not through bickering and expecting absolute support even in dire times. \n\nWhile the elder is being very insensitive and rude, so is the younger with her attitude of new found superiority, also lacking courtesy to share some empathy first and then get into the gory details. And she's already impatient, this attitude is prompting her to cut all ties now when they both should be ruminating over their loss. So immaturity is from both sides, while the elder sister might be acting irresponsibly, it's a practical mistake one that doesn't warrant the absurd reactions of the younger.", "Well said- I like your comment the best.

I don\u2019t think she realized what my hair was actually like. Not until after one last screaming match at 12 did she let me cut my hair (first ever cut) to above my shoulders and it went sproing and ended up around my ears instead. It definitely set the tone for my relationship with my mother to this day. Also the discovery of *real* conditioner changed how I felt about my hair.", "INSTANT flashback to my childhood right there. She'd just put her hand on top of my head and straight down with a paddle brush while telling me that it didn't hurt that much.  \n\n\nTurns out that while it looks kinda messy when it's long (like I always had to keep it)  when cut shoulder-ish length? I have 3B-3C curls.  \n\n\nSolidarity, my friend.", "I feel you. I also got tortured by my mother every morning with her brushing my curly hair (I\u2019m white, but my hair is curly enough that it still hurt so much I cried) with a brush and painfully braiding it. Got slapped and screamed all the while until I moved out at 15. Well, 20 years later, I don\u2019t own a brush, don\u2019t let anyone touch my hair, and have issues around receiving compliments on my looks. Doing that kind of thing to one\u2019s child repeatedly is a really messed up thing to do.", "God I can only imagine that suffering, my hair isn't curly at all just horrifically thick and stubborn, my mom AND stepmom tried their damndest for the tightest smoothest ponytails and braids possible and I can vividly remember crying as my mom yanked the shit out of my head. I shave everything but the very top of my head now and it still looks like a full mop til I swipe it to the side.", "I remember going to the salon once and this girl, maybe 7, with super curly hair was having it brushed and ironed. I looked over and the poor thing had tears in her eyes and her mom just sat there chatting with the hair lady. Like you could tell she accepted it, prolly got backlash in the past from mom for speaking out", "My mom has thin, stick straight hair that couldn\u2019t hold a curl to save it\u2019s life. I got my dad\u2019s hair, which is a whole head of 3a/3b curls, and my mom and I really struggled with it- we said it was our \u201cworld war 3.\u201d That being said, she was totally fine with me getting haircuts, and pretty early on, she actually just passed my hair responsibilities to my dad until I was old enough. This situation is so sad and I hope OP\u2019s sister loves her new hair and gets some support for the trauma.", "My hair is pin-straight and my mom wouldn't let me cut it or dye it. Somehow she managed to make brushing it hurt. I hated having her wash or brush my hair. She was so rough. I left home young, and one of the first things I did was cut my hair into an angled bob and dye it dark. She had curls but always wished she had straight hair like mine. I think it's a \"grass is greener\" thing. I thought her curls were beautiful and wished mine was like hers.", "I only have type 2 hair and even that's a pain in the arse to maintain. Curly hair takes time and patience. Too many parents don't take the time to get to know how to take care of their kid's hair, especially if they just have straight hair themselves.", "We struggled with my daughters super curly hair until we found the Wet brush. It's not wet but it glides through her hair like a knife through butter. Your wet comment reminded me of that discovery.  She's 25 and can only use that brush to tame her hair.", "Huh, that actually helps.  I think mine would classify as like a 2 to 3 A depending on length.  The shorter I wear it the tighter it curls but at my preferred shoulder length it's really bouncy loose curls.  Longer than my shoulders and it's just wavy.", "Been meaning to look this up. Thanks for the info!", "I'm so sorry, this sounds beyond painful. I hope you're free and happy, in a safe place where your sense of humour is appreciated!", "Get thee to r/curlyhair  (if you haven't been there already) for tips on how to care for your curls.  That sub is amazing."]}
