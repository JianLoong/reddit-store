Up until she was 13, mom insisted on washing and styling my sister's hair. She never let her cut it or dye it. When someone suggested getting it trimmed they were kicked out of the house. I won't lie, mom was controlling at times but I thought we all knew it was because of grief and memory of our dad.\n\nWell mom died and the first thing my sister did was get her hair chopped incredibly short and dyed. She sent myself and my siblings a picture of her new haircut, with the caption 'Sharon (our mom) always said I was going to grow my hair down to my butt...Not anymore'.  I thought it was my sister's way of grieving but now she mentions it a lot, like asking how pissed do I think mom would be if she saw my hair this short.\n\nI told her after the 5th comment to stop acting like her haircut was a big achievement, it's not, millions of people get haircuts and she should know her hair was important to mom because it reminded her of dad.

It's normal as hell. And your sister has been denied that perfectly normal option for her whole life. Give her a f\\*cking break.\n\nYTA.", "I grew up in a church where women don\u2019t cut their hair. I hated my hair. It went all the way down to my belt and it was thick, heavy, and hot. Pull it up to get it off my neck and I got a headache. Leave it down to prevent headache and get sweaty and tangled. \n\nOne of the first things I did after leaving home was cut it off and die it. I chose jet black. I couldn\u2019t wait to get away from a false image I\u2019d been forced to portray for so many years. \n\nI\u2019m going to say YTA because you likely can\u2019t begin to understand what that\u2019s like. Having your own hair be a prison. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be sympathetic and supportive. If you can\u2019t be those two things, why would she want you in her life?", "YTA. Hun, it wasn't just controlling; your mother was abusive. Torturing a kid like this (for something that's not medical) is absolutely traumatizing. I wasn't allowed to cut my hair until I was in the first grade. It was ALREADY below my butt. I was a little kid sitting on my own fucking hair. Finally, my father is the one who said \"if she wants to cut it, she should be allowed to cut it\". I went in with >2 feet of growth and came out with a bowl cut (was the only name of a short hair cut I knew). It absolutely was a fucking accomplishment.", "YTA\n\nYour Mother was controlling, your sister is just celebrating the freedom she has now\n\nYour Mother mourning your Father may be an explanation, but it isn't an excuse.", "YTA\n\nHow about some empathy?\n\nYour sister was traumatized by your mother, who essentially abused you. She has finally found freedom and you can't be happy with her.\n\nThe jealousy just oozes from this post. You see your sister as the golden child. She's a victim.", "YTA. You obviously understand this isn't just someone getting a haircut. You understand why it's a big deal. Sure a large volume of comments from her might get annoying but again, you know why. \n\nTo be fair, it's a soft y t a because I'm sure you're also grieving, and that can bring out the AH in anyone. Sorry for your loss.", "YTA, but I can understand why you don't understand. \n\nYour sister had a very different childhood that you did. She was abused, and your mother indoctrinated you to think that there was nothing wrong with what she was doing to your sister. \n\nBrushing a child's hair is not abusive in isolation. But your mother took it to an excess that definitely was. This wasn't something she had to do for hygiene or maintenance purposes. \n\nDeep, daily brushing of curly hair will actually damage it. Preventing her from cutting it to remove the damaged bits is even worse because that just made the entire mess more prone to tangles, knots and pain. Your mom wasn't doing your sister any favors.\n\nSpeaking as a child who had a super sensitive scalp? I'd have rather been spanked every day that have my hair brushed. It was torture. My mother eventually gave up and let me deal with it...when I was six. I grew out of the scalp pain as a teenager, but even brushing my own hair was agony. I eventually settled on finger combing unless there was a really bad tangle.\n\nYour sister said your mom treated her like a doll. That's not a healthy or acceptable way to express grief. If you want to dedicate your own hair as a memorial to your dead loved one, that's fine. But parents need to respect the bodily autonomy of their children and teach them how to make good decisions about their bodies and what other people are allowed to do to them. \n\nYou don't do that by controlling everything about a child's appearance until they're 13 and making them think that they don't deserve to choose what happens to their own body.\n\nYour sister called your mom by her name. Children who love their parents don't do that.\n\nYou might love your mom, but your sister probably doesn't. Your sister is celebrating her final and ultimate freedom from her abuser who tormented and controlled her all her life.\n\nI mean this next part in the kindest way possible: I encourage you to find yourself a good therapist and talk through everything your mother did to both your sister and you. You're grieving her, so therapy is a good idea. But you likely have a lot of warped perceptions about how your mother treated you that are not healthy, and you aren't even aware of that fact. You need to do some serious reflection on your childhood, and you need help to do it so someone can help you see what parts were unhealthy and what parts were genuinely good.", "YTA.\n\nYour sister is empowering herself and dealing with her childhood trauma and you're not only shaming her for that, you're trying to take on the role of your mother and compound and trigger her trauma. You're not being a good person or a good sister right now.", "YTA. You don't get it, do you? Your sister is free. This is big for her. Hard as it is to accept, your mother's 'controlling' behaviour wasn't on. Your sister is finally getting to express herself, even 'rebel' a little - that absolutely should be celebrated.", "I had my haircut this week. 14 inches. I cried when they cut it. They thought it was because I regretted it. I cried because I didn\u2019t realise how much trauma was wrapped up in that hair, how much it weighed me down mentally and physically. \nI\u2019m adjusting to my new very short hair. I feel very self conscious. I am both unsure it suits and happy it\u2019s gone. It changes day to day. \nFortunately those in my life have been great. They know it\u2019s not about the hair as a new chapter that I hope is a great one and by giving me thumbs up about my hair, they are supporting me. It\u2019s great to get going on a positive note as the future can feel overwhelming. \n\nShame you couldn\u2019t do that for your sister. \nYTA.", "YTA.   \nYou even acknowledge the crap your sister went thru at the hands of your mom controlling her hair for her own selfish reasons - and you don't see the liberation your sister must feel finally escaping it to become her own person with her own hair preferences?

Your sister is now free of the expectation and the pain - literal and figurative - of being a living, breathing homage to her father\u2019s memory for your mom \n\nShe\u2019s been denied a haircut her entire life.

You don't get to shit on her just because her way of expressing relief is annoying to you.", "Soft YTA - it *is* a big achievement for her. What you described as her childhood is straight up traumatic - having no agency over your own body to such an extreme degree is bad enough, but it was also saddling her with a HUGE burden - \"I miss your dad, so instead of dealing with that grief in healthy ways, you get to represent him for me and if you fail to do that you will receive my wrath.\" That is a terrible thing to do to a child.\n\nThe relief she must feel being able to make decisions about *her* body, it's clearly life-changing.

Especially if shes just getting to now. What your mother did was not healthy for her or your sister and the fact that you play down the pain is concerning.

Sometimes a haircut IS a big achievement. Just because millions of people get their haircut every day, doesn't mean it isn't a huge personal achievement for someone.

Cutting it is a huge step, it is taking back autonomy that she never got to have.", "YTA. Your sister is recovering from trauma and having control over her own hair is a big step for her.

You have the same issue your mother had, you think your sister should be OK with suffering just because of grief.", "It was incredibly abusive of your mother to deny her daughter bodily autonomy, putting her through pain daily, and then emotionally manipulating her to keep her hair long.

As I got older, the weight of it gave me headaches.\n\nWhen I finally got my hair cut to my shoulders as a teen, I was in for a lot of anger from my parents. But it was well worth it. They made me live with something I *hated* and felt *shameful* about for more than a decade. \n\nHair control is body control.

I can understand her view from a different point. I'm nonbinary and had long hair all my life because I grew up in a more conservative household. I was told all my life the typical conservative Christian things (being gay is a sin, you'll go to hell for it, etc etc). I have *ever* felt cisgender in my life. It wasn't until my school had a GSA that I learned nonbinary was even a *thing*. \n\nAfter I graduated, I said \"fuck it\" and chopped my hair off into even shorter than a pixie cut. I felt *obligated* to keep my hair long for my mom's sake. But being a new adult and finally understanding my identity...I embraced it.\n\nThis is *very* similar to what your sister is going through. For her, she's expressing an identity that she *never* got to have as a child due to an abusive/controlling mother. \n\nIf somebody in my life told me I couldn't cut my hair because I was supposed to be female, I would be absolutely *furious*.

I mean the group text to your siblings about your mom/her haircut, especially right after she passed, kinda feels a little tone deaf, but you understood this was her way of reacting to your moms death, and I think she was reflecting on their relationship too, and anger can be a big part of grief. But after a few times mentioning, she must\u2019ve seen how your reaction wasn\u2019t exactly the same as hers. And if you can respect her grieving process, why can\u2019t she respect yours?

It\u2019s a big part of who we are. One of the first things people tend to do when they\u2019re trying to move on from a chapter of their lives is get a new hairstyle.

I would consider apologizing for it and explaining yourself but also keep in mind that you shouldn\u2019t beat yourself up about it too much.", "YTA, and I sympathize greatly with your sister. While my mom didn't do anything with my hair, she was obsessed with the whole \"long hair is for girls\" thing, and she hated seeing short hair on girls. She actively told me this any time I thought about wanting my hair cut a bit shorter, berating me for wanting to \"look like a boy\" when that had nothing to do with the issue. The issue was I hated how long my hair was and how much of a pain it was to keep clean and straight. I was able to sit on my hair for the largest portion of my childhood, it was that long. I learned eventually her issues came from her mom forcing her to cut her hair really short and she hated it, but instead of handling it through therapy (like she should've, but unfortunately she was one of those \"therapy is for crazy people\" types), she projected her trauma onto me. Which sounds exactly like what your mom did to your sister. Instead of processing the trauma of your father's death through healthier means, she took it out on your sister. Your mother was wrong for that, and what she did was abusive. You may not want to think so, but that is the truth of the matter. Controlling someone in the way that she did your sister is abuse.  \n\n\nIt was actually both sad and liberating when I got my hair cut for the first time after my mom's passing. When I was about 12/13, I had my hair cut short not because of my own choice but because I got lice and it was impossible to rid it all from my longer hair. And it actually felt so amazing having my hair cut at that time, seeing all of that long hair gone and I had my hair at my shoulders. My mom saw how happy I was with the short hair, despite her issues, and we came to the agreement of allowing me one hair cut a year. Which I accepted at the time as a kid, but kept up with it as an adult because if I had kept my hair permanently short like what I wanted I'd never hear the end to the comments and complaints that she made every time my hair was cut. But when I got my hair cut for the first time after her passing, I felt sad because I knew she would have a comment, but also liberated because I didn't have to hear it. I no longer had to follow that agreement, I could have my hair as short as I wanted. And I did.  \n\n\nSounds like your sister is finally feeling like she can be free to have her hair be what she wanted it to be, to be the person she wanted to be, that your mother would allow her to be. And good for her, because it's a very good feeling when you finally feel like you're out of the grip of a controlling parent and allowed to be your own person, not whatever it was they wanted you to be. I hope that you are able to come to understand that, while you two were living under the same roof, you lived in entirely different worlds and that your sister holds none of the sentiments that you do towards your mother. And I hope you learn that, while you love your mother, she was not a good person towards your sister and instead of continuing to be disparaging towards your sister as she's now experiencing freedom from her abuser, you respect her feelings all the same.", "YTA- So your mom put your sister through physical pain for 17 years, and you don't think that is abusive behavior?

OP needs to realize that cutting her hair is a big deal for their sister because she was constantly abused and that just because OP wasn't subjected to this abuse and OP's mother provided for them (and probably loved them both in her own twisted way) that it doesn't mean she wasn't abusive. If OP truly had a better relationship with her mother they probably see their sister's comments as \"haha I'm so glad mom is dead\" while they might actively still be actively grieving over their death. OP being older probably also has some memories of their mom before their father's death and these may be clouding the image of what their mom actually became.

Even if she wasn't a great mother (I don't think we need to decide that to judge this), OP clearly loved their mother and is grieving. It is very normal for children to love their flawed parents and their pain when those parents die is still real. \n\nSister may have a legitimate beef with Mom but Mom is dead. Mom can't see or hear anything Sister is doing. Whether or not Mom deserved to be told off isn't relevant, since Mom is gone and Mom isn't who Sister is talking to. The question here is whether or not Sister should keep using OP to try and indirectly tell off someone who can no longer hear her when it hurts OP. \n\nSister's reaction to mom's death was to send her siblings all a message saying \"look, Mom was wrong and I don't care what she thinks!\" And while that's a legitimate take for sister to have, it's not very empathic of her either to choose *her grieving siblings* as the ones to tell this to. A friend, therapist, or complete stranger would have been a more empathic choice. But I can excuse the first time. Or the second. Maybe the third. But sister KEEPS bringing this up to OP. She's not telling OP how happy she is with her hair now or anything. Nope, what she keeps telling OP is think about how upset your recently deceased mothers would be if she could see me now! It's a clear \"F our dead Mom!\" from OP's sister, made repeatedly to OP as OP grieves their mother's death.\n\nWhether or not you think OP's Mom deserves the \"F you\" Sister is making them to someone else (OP) who her comments are hurt. \n\nSo ESH I guess. OP could be more empathic to her sister, but her sister behavior is completely lacking in empathy as well. I can't tell if OP's sister somehow dosen't realize that this is hurtful to OP and keeps repeating these comments again and again hoping that this will magically be the time she gets whatever reaction she is looking for, or she knows it hurts OP's feelings and that's the point. Maybe she is misplacing her anger onto OP since she's still here to make feel bad? Or maybe she dosen't think Mom deserves grieving and it annoyed OP is acting sad Mom died so is trying to punish her? Or maybe she just wants attention and to be told \"Yeah, Mom would be *pissssed,* you sure showed her!\" from her grieving siblings (and despite the fact it's too late to show Mom anything) and is too self-absorbed to notice or care how they feel? \n\nBut whatever Sister's motivation here, it's not productive or kind.", "It\u2019s not that - not letting her cut it would be controlling but not abuse.

There's a level of radical acceptance necessary for situations like these, if the siblings have a shot at unpacking this together.", "There was no pain brought into this though? OP said she cried because it was long and unpleasant, which makes sense, because she's a child. \n\nThe mother was definitely selfish in wanting to brush her daughters hair because it reminded her of dead husband, but abusive? Come on, do you really think she was forcefully and roughly brushing her hair, that again reminded her of her DEAD husband and was treating the hair badly,  and it still took that long?", "Right, I do not appreciate people who look at a persons actions towards another person and shrug it off like, oh she didn\u2019t do it to me so it\u2019s fine. Empathyyyyyyyyyy. And guess what if a person is a dick to someone else who doesn\u2019t deserve it while being nice to you, they\u2019re STILL a dick person.", "So she has to keep quiet about being free from her trauma and super controlling and emotionally immature mother just because her abuse didn't affect OP?", "Decorum my ass. Her sister had every right to celebrate the death of her abuser.", "Where was the mother\u2019s understanding and decorum? She was the adult.", "Wow. So victims have to be perfect about it when their abusers finally kick the bucket", "Yeah I made a post saying this, she\u2019s ignoring the 98% of YTA. She has her mind made up and isn\u2019t here to actually find out.", "Exactly!", "The empty threats were manipulative and bad in their own way and also had homophobic undertones. I'm sorry you had your autonomy violated as well. \u2764\ufe0f", "So many layers to this alone", "Yeah well, it sounds like OP has inherited their mom's unhealthy mindset that she's obligated to keep her hair long as a tribute to their long deceased father. Or at least doesn't understand why that attitude is problematic as hell. So of course OP doesn't get it.", "I'm wondering if they're mixed and the mom is white, and sis is the only one to get 3/4c hair.", "THIS!!!!", "I'm thinking the ignorance is as genuine as the bitterness. YTA OP", "You are wrong. \n\n\nAnd you are willfully ignorant.", "Nice to see you cherry picking the few comments that agree with you. Clearly you came here in good faith.", "I really hope you escape the abusive cycle your mother has perpetuated for you. Your sister feels free finally and all she is receiving from you is vitriol.", "\ud83e\udd22", "You're well on your way to being NC'ed by your sister. Congratulations.", "Sorry dude, it\u2019s the little things that get to us\u2764\ufe0f", "Because \u2026 that was her normal, that\u2019s all she knew. She needs to hear that not everyone\u2019s mother did that. Not all children with curly hair scream.", "It's because it didn't affect HER directly. She saw the outcome but since it wasn't her sitting on that bathroom floor or in that chair having her hair yanked and pulled she can't see the true pain.\n\nHaving textured hair is a pain in the ass (I used to have Shirley temple curly hair. Thankfully not anymore. My hair is now more typically basic girl hair so a brush won't make me cry anymore. Kinda curly/wavy but not to the point I need special products) and having a parent who wants it a set way without change and as it grows longer....it's painful. Even untextured hair gets painful when long!", "The denial is real with this one :/ sister is best cutting contact as it seems like she will just be gaslit about her own abuse in this relationship", "I also thought that", "I\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s 3/4c hair?", "Yeah, I wondered about that. Freaking white lady tryna brush the girl\u2019s hair while she screams. YTA.", "Not to mention emotionally abusing and scarring her to the point that it took her mother's death, two years after becoming an adult  (OP mentioned in a comment that she's 20) before she felt emotionally safe enough to cut her hair.", "Very curly/tight curls that people of African heritage have.", "It refers to the curl type of hair. I believe A B and C refer to how thick/coarse the actual strand is, while 1-4 refers to how tight the curls are, 1 being stick straight and 4 being super tight curls. So 3/4C hair would be very curly hair that is common among Black people (someone pls correct me if there\u2019s a better way to say this)"]}
