Up until she was 13, mom insisted on washing and styling my sister's hair. She never let her cut it or dye it. When someone suggested getting it trimmed they were kicked out of the house. I won't lie, mom was controlling at times but I thought we all knew it was because of grief and memory of our dad.\n\nWell mom died and the first thing my sister did was get her hair chopped incredibly short and dyed. She sent myself and my siblings a picture of her new haircut, with the caption 'Sharon (our mom) always said I was going to grow my hair down to my butt...Not anymore'.  I thought it was my sister's way of grieving but now she mentions it a lot, like asking how pissed do I think mom would be if she saw my hair this short.\n\nI told her after the 5th comment to stop acting like her haircut was a big achievement, it's not, millions of people get haircuts and she should know her hair was important to mom because it reminded her of dad.

It's normal as hell. And your sister has been denied that perfectly normal option for her whole life. Give her a f\\*cking break.\n\nYTA.", "I grew up in a church where women don\u2019t cut their hair. I hated my hair. It went all the way down to my belt and it was thick, heavy, and hot. Pull it up to get it off my neck and I got a headache. Leave it down to prevent headache and get sweaty and tangled. \n\nOne of the first things I did after leaving home was cut it off and die it. I chose jet black. I couldn\u2019t wait to get away from a false image I\u2019d been forced to portray for so many years. \n\nI\u2019m going to say YTA because you likely can\u2019t begin to understand what that\u2019s like. Having your own hair be a prison. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be sympathetic and supportive. If you can\u2019t be those two things, why would she want you in her life?", "YTA. Hun, it wasn't just controlling; your mother was abusive. Torturing a kid like this (for something that's not medical) is absolutely traumatizing. I wasn't allowed to cut my hair until I was in the first grade. It was ALREADY below my butt. I was a little kid sitting on my own fucking hair. Finally, my father is the one who said \"if she wants to cut it, she should be allowed to cut it\". I went in with >2 feet of growth and came out with a bowl cut (was the only name of a short hair cut I knew). It absolutely was a fucking accomplishment.", "YTA\n\nYour Mother was controlling, your sister is just celebrating the freedom she has now\n\nYour Mother mourning your Father may be an explanation, but it isn't an excuse.", "YTA\n\nHow about some empathy?\n\nYour sister was traumatized by your mother, who essentially abused you. She has finally found freedom and you can't be happy with her.\n\nThe jealousy just oozes from this post. You see your sister as the golden child. She's a victim.", "YTA. You obviously understand this isn't just someone getting a haircut. You understand why it's a big deal. Sure a large volume of comments from her might get annoying but again, you know why. \n\nTo be fair, it's a soft y t a because I'm sure you're also grieving, and that can bring out the AH in anyone. Sorry for your loss.", "YTA, but I can understand why you don't understand. \n\nYour sister had a very different childhood that you did. She was abused, and your mother indoctrinated you to think that there was nothing wrong with what she was doing to your sister. \n\nBrushing a child's hair is not abusive in isolation. But your mother took it to an excess that definitely was. This wasn't something she had to do for hygiene or maintenance purposes. \n\nDeep, daily brushing of curly hair will actually damage it. Preventing her from cutting it to remove the damaged bits is even worse because that just made the entire mess more prone to tangles, knots and pain. Your mom wasn't doing your sister any favors.\n\nSpeaking as a child who had a super sensitive scalp? I'd have rather been spanked every day that have my hair brushed. It was torture. My mother eventually gave up and let me deal with it...when I was six. I grew out of the scalp pain as a teenager, but even brushing my own hair was agony. I eventually settled on finger combing unless there was a really bad tangle.\n\nYour sister said your mom treated her like a doll. That's not a healthy or acceptable way to express grief. If you want to dedicate your own hair as a memorial to your dead loved one, that's fine. But parents need to respect the bodily autonomy of their children and teach them how to make good decisions about their bodies and what other people are allowed to do to them. \n\nYou don't do that by controlling everything about a child's appearance until they're 13 and making them think that they don't deserve to choose what happens to their own body.\n\nYour sister called your mom by her name. Children who love their parents don't do that.\n\nYou might love your mom, but your sister probably doesn't. Your sister is celebrating her final and ultimate freedom from her abuser who tormented and controlled her all her life.\n\nI mean this next part in the kindest way possible: I encourage you to find yourself a good therapist and talk through everything your mother did to both your sister and you. You're grieving her, so therapy is a good idea. But you likely have a lot of warped perceptions about how your mother treated you that are not healthy, and you aren't even aware of that fact. You need to do some serious reflection on your childhood, and you need help to do it so someone can help you see what parts were unhealthy and what parts were genuinely good.", "YTA.\n\nYour sister is empowering herself and dealing with her childhood trauma and you're not only shaming her for that, you're trying to take on the role of your mother and compound and trigger her trauma. You're not being a good person or a good sister right now.", "YTA. You don't get it, do you? Your sister is free. This is big for her. Hard as it is to accept, your mother's 'controlling' behaviour wasn't on. Your sister is finally getting to express herself, even 'rebel' a little - that absolutely should be celebrated.", "I had my haircut this week. 14 inches. I cried when they cut it. They thought it was because I regretted it. I cried because I didn\u2019t realise how much trauma was wrapped up in that hair, how much it weighed me down mentally and physically. \nI\u2019m adjusting to my new very short hair. I feel very self conscious. I am both unsure it suits and happy it\u2019s gone. It changes day to day. \nFortunately those in my life have been great. They know it\u2019s not about the hair as a new chapter that I hope is a great one and by giving me thumbs up about my hair, they are supporting me.

You don't get to shit on her just because her way of expressing relief is annoying to you.", "Soft YTA - it *is* a big achievement for her. What you described as her childhood is straight up traumatic - having no agency over your own body to such an extreme degree is bad enough, but it was also saddling her with a HUGE burden - \"I miss your dad, so instead of dealing with that grief in healthy ways, you get to represent him for me and if you fail to do that you will receive my wrath.\" That is a terrible thing to do to a child.\n\nThe relief she must feel being able to make decisions about *her* body, it's clearly life-changing.

Sometimes a haircut IS a big achievement. Just because millions of people get their haircut every day, doesn't mean it isn't a huge personal achievement for someone.

Your sister was denied an integral part of growing up and her identity at an age where life is confusing as hell anyway. She\u2019s liberated and is sharing that with you. Please don\u2019t shut the door in her face.", "Oh she absolutely was abusive. That level of obsession and control is beyond fucked up. I am sorry for your loss, however I bet your sister is honestly relieved in a sense that your mother has passed.\n\nYTA, and someone should stepped in way before your mom died and given your sister her freedom.", "She wasn\u2019t towards you, but towards you sister it\u2019s a different story.", "Abuse is far more than just hitting someone. I'm sorry, I know you're grieving, but the mother she was to you was not the mother she was to your sister.", "What she did was literal abuse, and damaged her hair. YTA for only responding to argue", "She literally hurt your sister every morning. Her own daughter screamed and cried every morning but your mother didn't care. She is abusive. And the fact that you're defending her bad behavior shows that you're abusive too.", "How is hurting a child over and over not abusive? Please explain", "Frankly, that's for your sister to decide, not you.", "not being allowed to wash your hair until teenage years in abuse. Painful constant brushing is abuse. Dead spouse lookalike hair is abuse", "Hey, Reddit likes to jump on the abuse train. Multiple things can be true at once. Your mom was struggling and maybe made a mistake due to grief. Your sister was deeply affected by it and was finally able to seize that autonomy. You can be there for her AND love your mom.", "Not allowing a person to cut their OWN hair is indeed abusive. My abusive stepfather wouldn't let my mom cut her hair until one day she finally cut it in the shower to spite him, her one act of rebellion. I can't remember a time I've ever been so proud of her tbh", "Would you tolerate this treatment from a romantic partner? Of course not, because it\u2019s controlling and emotionally manipulative. Your mom needed some mental healthcare because she should not be grieving in that manner for over a decade.", "Please read Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay C Gibson. You'll see the toxic behaviour detailed there. This was highly unhealthy behaviour. Just because it was normalised in your home, it doesn't mean it was healthy.", "This is 100% abuse. It might not have been intentional but it's abuse.", "Im gonna say this as nicely as I can.\n\nWhen she demanded and forced your sister to keep her hair a certain way and allowed her no respect, control or even an opinion on her OWN body (hair) she was abusive. Your sister was forced to be a doll to your mother. She couldn't do anything as simple as a hair cut because your mother wanted her to basically be a living memorial of your father. That in itself is abusive.\n\nYou don't have to hit someone to be abusive. The fact of the controlling she did was in itself abusive. I'm sorry to say that but it's the truth.\n\nShe was a good mother to you but not your sister.", "She controlled your sister's autonomy because her hair reminded her of your Father, that's abuse in my book.", "Maybe she wasn\u2019t the golden child, maybe you\u2019re just shitty", ">Growing up, mom would spend hours on my sister's hair, and each morning was dedicated to the two of them in bathroom, with my sister screaming and crying \n\nNO. YOU were not abused. Congrats, good for you. Your sister was abused for HOURS EVERY MORNING!!!", "Your sister, at the very least, was abused. Forcing your child to wear and style her hair a certain way because it reminds you of your dead spouse is incredibly toxic, controlling and manipulative. It lead to hours of daily emotional distress for your sister. Kicking someone out of the house for suggesting she get a trim is unhinged. Get yourself into therapy so you can start to process how your childhood was extremely not normal.", "She wasn\u2019t being a good mother to your sister though", "So all the screaming and crying because whatever your mom was doing to her hair *hurt* was what? Just for fun?", "... you literally just described it in your post", "Why so bitter about it? Your mother had control over her body, she regained it, did you siffer the same? Have you ever felt that?", "She was NOT a good mom to your sister.", "Forget \u201cgolden child,\u201d it doesn\u2019t sound like she was a child at all. She was your mom\u2019s living doll. If you thought that behavior was normal, it\u2019s only because you were use to it.", "thats abuse, and shes not a good mom, youre fighting for an abusive person and that tells a lot of a person youre shaping to be", "You described a pretty intense scene there. I won't call it abuse since it appears the word is loaded for you, but uh... that sounds pretty mean. Sounds like your mom put a lot of grief on your sister.", "She put your sister through hours of pain every day, for no reason, other than her own wants. She caused your sister pain, on purpose, when it could have been avoided. \n\nThat is abuse. \n\nImagine this\u2026imagine your dad had hairless legs.  And you had hairy legs. And in memory to him, every day, your mom got out the hot wax and ripped off all the hair from your legs for years. And didn\u2019t let you shave, didn\u2019t let you keep the hair, just kept doing it no matter how much it hurt or you screamed in pain. \n\nWould you be ok with that? No.  Because it\u2019s absurd. Just like your mom was absurd with your sister\u2019s hair. She purposefully caused her pain for no reason.", "You haven't responded to anyone who brought up your sister screaming and crying in the bathroom.  I wonder why.\n\nGigantic AH.", "I'm going to say NTA solely because she knows you're grieving and she could've enjoyed her haircut without rubbing in your face that your mother is no longer here. She is old enough to understand decorum. I'm so very sorry for your loss.", "You try having someone control what you can do with your body for basically your entire life and see if you don\u2019t have issues.", "You are a terrible sibling.", "Her \"issues to work on\" are the ones your mother caused.", "Are you only going to listen to the small minority of highly-downvoted people who give N T A responses or are you actually going to pay attention to what pretty much everyone is telling you?\n\nYTA in a big way, not just for the story in the OP but for how you are completely denying your sister's experience of being abused in all of your subsequent comments.", "Exactly. Having an \"unhealthy obsession\" with how someone else keeps their hair *is* abusive. Denying someone else bodily autonomy *is* abuse. Denying someone necessary care for their health (and a trim is a necessity for the health of your hair, especially if you're curly and wearing it long) *is* abusive.", "It was not done to you. Nor are you a certified judge or jury in a court room  you do not get to decide that", "Definitely abuse, the sister doesn't even call Mom \"Mom\".\n\nOP  YTA", "too many trolls on this subreddit. He might be faking ignorance. That poor, poor girl", ">Growing up, mom would spend hours on my sister's hair, and each morning was dedicated to the two of them in bathroom, with my sister screaming and crying because brushing through it was long and unpleasant. \n\nYour sister was screaming and crying every day.", "She wasn\u2019t even allowed to wash it unsupervised until 13!", "Where was the decorum when OP's sister was abused for 17 years? Oh yes, victims of abuse are not allowed to be angry, they have to be pretty little dolls, right?", "No decorum required for someone who dehumanized her for her entire life.", "WTF does decorum has to do with someone feeling free from her abusive mother for the first time in her life?", "You realize they had the same mother, yes? They are BOTH grieving.", "Thank you", "Someone needs to pull his hair out one by one for him to have an ounce of sympathy. Smh", "It was not something the sister wanted, it was not necessary, and it caused her to scream in pain. \n\nThat\u2019s sounds pretty dang abusive.", "It baffles me that those are her own words and still she can\u2019t see it.", "You know, I\u2019m going to be nice and let him off easy with no hair pulling.\n\nHe just needs to wear his mother\u2019s exact hairstyle every day for the next 17 years to properly honor her."]}
