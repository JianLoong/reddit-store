A couple of weeks ago her boyfriend (19M)'s family went on a day hike. They asked my daughter to come. All of them including my daughter love to hike. I didn't think it would be a issue and let her go. I was wrong.\n\n  From what the forest service guy told me. Along with what my daughter said. There was a rock slide halfway up the trail.\n\n My daughter fell and got hurt. Her boyfriends family decided to finish the hike to the top and come back later to help her down.\nEven after my daughter told them she was in horrible pain.\n\nAfter a couple of hours the forest service ranger (FSR) found her. He loaded her on a 4 wheeler and helped her down the hill. The FSR called me. I immediately came. We left a note on BF's car along with the FSR stayed in the area. To let them know my daughter was taken to the hospital.\n\nThe whole way to the hospital she was sobbing. Not only from the pain but because they left her. It deeply hurt her. She broke her foot/ankle in 3 places. She needed surgery. The 2 days she was in the hospital. They didn't check on her once. \n\nWe saw their post and photos on social media from the top of the mountain. Talking about what a great time they had.\n\nSeeing how hurt she was. We spoke to our daughter about what happened and what she wanted from this relationship. She told us she didn't want to be with her BF anymore. She sent her BF a text saying she was breaking up with him. After a flood of messages. we all blocked him and his family.\n\n6 days ago. We started getting notes taped to our cars, doors, some left for her in the office at school.\nYesterday ex BF came to the house.( I opened my main door but left my securityScreen door closed. talking through it.) \nHe asked if his family could take my daughter to dinner as an apology. Since his family didnt think what they did was wrong but, he loved her and his family wanted to clear the air between them. \n\nThis is probably where I am the A.\nI flat out told him he is not allowed to take my daughter anywhere.  I stressed Since he chose to leave my daughter when she was hurt. I no longer trusted him to be around her. Then shut the main door before he could say anything else.\n\nNow some of our mutual friends are saying I am an A for not allowing them to \"make it up\" to our daughter and closing the door on him. \n\nAm I allowing my mama bear judgment of this 19yr. old cloud the right thing to do here?\nAm I the A?", "created_utc": 1677012347, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118ejv7/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_daughter_go_to_dinner/", "score": 368, "replies": ["NTA.\n\n1) he still doesn't think it was wrong to leave your daughter when she was hurt\n\n2) his family doesn't think they were wrong for leaving her when she was hurt.\n\n3) neither the bf or his family came to the hospital after she needed surgery.\n\n4) no attempt has been with an apology (even an insincere one)\n\n5) their idea of \"clearing the air\" is probably gaslight your daughter into thinking she was over reacting.\n\n6) if he truly loved your daughter none of the above would have happened.\n\nAgain, NTA", "NTA pity he didn't love her enough not to desert a vulnerable, injured, teenager in the middle of nowhere for hours, totally unable to seek help for herself, scared and in severe pain. \nHe got away lightly.", "NTA and honestly I would get a restraining order. They left an underage girl with a broken ankle on a trail. That's child endangerment. They could have charges pressed. She needs to be very, very far away from these horrible people.", "NTA and you might want to consider getting a no contact order if boyfriend or his family continue to try to communicate with your daughter, let alone show up uninvited to your home or leave notes on your cars.  \n\n\nETA I'm also just putting together that he's slightly older so he doesn't even go to her school. The school should be somehow looped in that you don't want these people communicating with her or leaving notes for her there.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter clearly stated that she did not want to be with this person anymore, and then proceeded to cut off all communication.\n\nYou didn't refuse to let her go with them, you refused to break her boundary FOR them.", "NTA- \nThese people seem to be all about \u201cshow\u201d, and as soon as daughter became inconvenient to that show- they ditched her and went on with what they wanted. \nJust can\u2019t trust them, period.", "OMG no, NTA in any way.  \n\nThey LEFT your daughter on a trail in the forest with a broken foot/ankle and never once followed up until she broke up with him.  That's some bullshit.  \n\nIf he loved her that much, he would have taken her to the hospital immediately or contacted the FSP for help instead of continuing his hike.  \n\nYou were 100% in the right to keep him away from her.  And if he and his family continue to harass you, contact the police.  Honestly, now that I've said that, it might not be bad to contact them now and give them a heads up about this potential stalking behavior.", "NTA your friends are out of their minds. Their behavior is shocking and disgusting. Good on you for helping her get space and telling them to back off. I mean the fact that they\u2019d not think they\u2019ve done anything wrong????", "NTA.  There is no making up in this situation.  They left her injured on a hiking trail!  The girl needed surgery and they LEFT HER.  Not just the parents but the BF who now claims to just lover her so very much LEFT HER.  Not getting past this.  There is NO making up for this type of behavior. These are awful people and your daughter should stay the hell away from all of them.", "NTA. Your daughter made it clear that she wanted nothing to do with him, and then he started displaying worrying behavior by essentially *stalking* her. You are absolutely in the right to keep her away from this guy.", "NTA!\n\nThey left your daughter, injured and in pain, on the side of a trail so that they could continue their little adventure.  These are not the type of people you want your child around regardless of how old everyone involved is.  It speaks volumes to their character.", "NTA \n\nThey deliberately left an injured person on the trail so they could finish their hike. Your daughter was left alone and injured until she was rescued. She had no way of defending herself from wildlife or humans with ill intent.", "Hold on\u2026..during a hike, your daughter fell and they left her?!!!!!\nRight after, they didn\u2019t reach out, visit, bring flowers, food, or anything?\n\nFriends think you should show them grace or whatever? No, you do what works for you.\n\nI would have been commenting in the social media posts \u201cglad you got your photo op, hope it was worth abandoning a person who was injured for them\u201d or something worse.\n\nNTA!!!!\n\nEditing to add, I wouldn\u2019t trust them either. If your daughter felt sick during the meal, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be too busy photographing it to get her home or help.", "NTA Do your friends know the entire story? If they do you need new friends. And if the ex and family continue harassing you go to the police. Your daughter doesn't want to see them and who leaves a badly injured teenager and continues hiking?? And the dinner isn't to apologize since they don't think they did anything wrong - it's to \"clear the air\" which sounds like a gaslighting party. The whole family sounds abusive.", "oh my god NTA!!!!! What the fuck is wrong with that family?!", "NTA and mutual friends are NOT making sense at all. You don't leave anyone hurt on a trail so you can go have more fun. They acted horribly and they still don't think they did anything wrong. There is no air to clear. Keep people who are this selfish away from your daughter and your entire family. \n\nThis might actually be considered criminal neglect, by the way. You could press charges.", "NTA. This makes me mad on so many levels, and I don't even have kids. I'd be sueing them for the medical costs. I wouldn't if they had shown any decency and turned back after the accident, but leaving her there?! You NEVER leave an injured person alone in the wilderness! EVER. I hope that forest service person had a very long chat with them. Had your daughter been forced to try to walk (animal approaching or someone with bad intent) she could have crippled herself for life. Or cut an artery and bled to death.\n\nEdit: typo", "\"Excuse me, ma'am, we left your daughter with a broken ankle with no help available and continued on our hike without a worry in the world. We'd like to take her to dinner to make it all good again.\" I think not! NTA.", "NTA -  In what way could you ever trust people like this again with your daughter in any way. If someone did this to my daughter then I would effectively cut them off from all contact.", "NTA - I wouldn't let him or his family anywhere near my kid again.  Also, if they don't stop with the notes, I'd go to the cops about the harassment.", "NTA. They abandoned a member of their party on the trail after she had a serious injury. That is about as asshole as it gets. The fact that they don\u2019t think they did anything wrong ratchets up the asshole level a few more notches. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything wrong when we left you injured on the trail, but here is a hamburger\u201c isn\u2019t the way to make it up to her.", "NTA. HE LEFT HER ON A MOUNTAIN HURT AND ALONE. His whole family collectively decided a fun little hike was more important than your daughter and her safety. They will never see her as worth caring for if he couldn't care for her in that moment of pain and emergency.", "NTA! \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with your \"friends?\" Did they ignore the fact that the exbf and his family LEFT HER THERE ALONE AND DEFENSELESS??? to top that they still don't think they're in the wrong for prioritizing your daughter over a hike they can finish later. Time to drop some friends. ExBF'S family must not be telling the whole story. \n\nYou're a great mom. Keep it up!", "100% NTA \n\nThis is horribly fucked up.", "NTA at all! They left her, with a broken leg on a trail - something else could have happen to her + all the notes? Nah, you're in the right", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t want to be with a guy who abandoned her when she was injured.", "Nta. Your daughter doesnt want anything to do with him its not as if youre disrespecting her wishes.", "NTA. Not at all. That family were the total AH for leaving your daughter. And not only that, \\*she\\* doesn't want to see him.", "NTA - I would not have left a stranger in that predicament, let alone someone he supposedly loves.", "NTA\n\nFirst off she fell and hurt herself, they ALL left her in severe pain to finish a hike. Including the bf who so called loved her left her. Not one of them were concerned about her well being.\n\nSecondly non of them including the bf checked on her while she was in the hospital. \n\nShe had to have surgery from a injury that she sustained while out with them, and they left her for hours sitting there in pain, instead of taking her to a hospital themselves. And spent the time hiking and taking pictures while your daughter was in pain with a broken ankle, and needing surgery.\n\nYeah anyone did that to my child, I would not trust them to be around her ever again either.\n\nAnd it is best she broke up with him. He cared so much for her that it was more important for him to finish a hike and get pictures than it was for him to stay with his gf who was in so much pain. He left her sitting all alone just like his parents did.\n\nThey obviously did not care about her at all. \n\nYou are being a good mom", "NTA. How dare they leave your injured daughter behind! I hope that she respects herself enough to not get back together with him.", "NTA. Not just the 19-year-olds judgement. It was his whole family. Not a bright one in the bunch.", "NTA. Why would you let him in when your daughter broke up with him? You didn't make her. She decided to. BTW exbf and family are jerks.", "I\u2019ve been hiking with my son and his gf, and if she got hurt I would move heaven and earth to get her to safety, and I\u2019m a bit of an asshole myself, hard NTA", "Absolutely NTA. Screw them. I'd have some choice words as well as clear instructions to never dirty my doorway with their presence again.\n\nOnly thing you might reconsider is that your daughter is 17, and is old enough that you should consider including her in the decision a bit.", "NTA. They left your daughter injured, crying and alone on the side of a mountain, FOR HOURS! \n\nThey can take their \"apology dinner\", shine it up real nice, turn it sideways, and shove it straight up their candy asses", "NTA. Do not let this person near her. And help her to stay strong if she starts to waver. I am glad she is refusing to even read his notes. He is displaying classic abuser behavior. He behaved horribly and now is claiming to love her and need her back. And he is basically stalking her. And wtf is wrong with his parents?!", "# NTA 100%\n\nThey left your daughter in pain with multiple fractures to her foot, severe enough that it needed a two day hospital stay and surgery. Also, I'm not sure where you are based, but in my area of the world the wildlife on mountain hikes can include bears and cougars. Your daughter was to all intents and purposes defenseless.", "NTA. Not at all! They\u2019re insane!", "NTA;  An apology is due for her being hurt in her care.  Not taking care of her on hike is unforgivable.\n\nNevermind a girlfriend, if any member of any travel group were in distress, it would be assumed they take priority.", "NTA\n\nOnly a complete compassion bypass would cause anyone to do something like this, and it sounds like it runs through the whole family.\n\nDo they really think a bit of dinner is going to make up for that monumental error in judgement?\n\nI wouldn't trust them to have sole responsibility for a goldfish let alone your daughter.", "**Hard NTA**", "They put their hike above your daughter, they can fuck off. At any point they could have turned around but nope, just ditched her and all left.", "Your mom radar is right: these people are not to be trusted with your daughter. Thank god the ranger rescued her! What the adults did was reprehensible, and anyone who tries to gaslight your family about the situation is not to be trusted.", "NTA. The bf & his family are a whole clan of AH, though.", "NTA, she isn\u2019t safe around him or his family. Send them a final notice to leave you alone, if they do not, I\u2019d get a restraining order.", "NTA\n\nYou don't leave someone on the side of the trail alone. You just don't. Especially if they can't walk.\n\nThey're mad at you because they want their family name to be clear. \n\nMy only word of advice would be to make sure your daughter is aware of their behavior & what you're doing. Don't make decisions for her & make sure you two are aligned. \n\nAlso, text them that they need to stop leaving notes & stalking your family. That's crazy behavior and a paper trail helps if it escalates.", "NTA. She could have gone into shock or become disoriented from the pain and gotten lost or injured even worse and they LEFT HER. Gordon Ramsay presonally serving the food at his top table couldn't make up for shit like this.\n\nAlso, notes taped to cars and left at the school office? They'd be getting a visit from the police for continued stalking and harassment.", "NTA.  Anyone who treated my kids like that would be greeted at the door with a bazooka.  Your daughter deserves better than these clowns.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t just mama bear behavior. This is normal mom behavior. It is 100% not normal to leave an injured person and hike to the top of a mountain while she hangs out alone. I\u2019m glad she broke up with him. Remind your \u201cmutual friends\u201d that if their child was injured, they likely wouldn\u2019t have wanted their child left alone either. Those are not friends, by the way.", "NTA. And what the f\\*ck is wrong with your friends!? I think you need to break up with them too!", "NTA\n\nThis is one of those titles where it seems like the OP might be the asshole, but you're not. They left your injured child in distress while she needed medical attention and they don't have any good justifications for what they did. She shouldn't trust them and neither should you. Why give them a second chance to show how little they value her feelings and safety?", "NTA. I was gonna write that unless there was some extremely extenuating circumstances, then they are a horrible family, but I can not think of why they would leave a 17 year old - a minor! - who is hurt, AFTER a rockslide.\n\nI can not fathom what those people were thinking!", "NTA and thank you for protecting your daughter! Cannot believe the think a dinner and some annoying notes can make up for this.", "NTA but you should talk to a lawyer and press charges.", "Nta, and I\u2019d sue them for the hospital bills. They LEFT her, so dangerous and careless.", "NTA. They left a minor with a serious injury on a trail alone to finish their hike instead of seeking medical care. Your response was appropriate.", "NTA . Your daughter could\u2019ve died and they left her there with a broken in three places foot so they could finish a fucking hike . Pretty gross.", "Absolutely NTA. What they did to your daughter was cruel.", "NTA\nYour daughter clearly doesn\u2019t want to be with her ex BF. That\u2019s reason enough for you to stop her ex from harassing her for second chance", "definitely NTA, you're being a parent. what they did is crazy. i wouldn\u2019t even leave someone i don\u2019t know hurt without making sure they got medical assistance.", "NTA. A dinner to apologize for leaving her hurt on a mountain? You did the right thing by removing these types of people from her life.", "NTA, also you need to get away from the friends who say you need to let them make it up.\n\nGet better friends !!", "What the heck was their justification for leaving her to continue the hike!?", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA wtf??? feck those guys", "NTA and I\u2019m reading this while watching a documentary on Gabby Petito. Stay away from those people.", "NTA.  Your daughter knows how to contact her ex if she wants anything more to do with him.  Unless she does that, you don't owe them anything.  As for wanting to make it up to her, did they offer to pay even a part of her medical bills?", "NTA  These people are disgusting to leave an injured child and not even bother to check up on her for two days. Psychos the whole lot. They probably just wanted to take her out to post about it later and be commended in some way.", "NTA.  Good riddance to that guy and his entire garbage family.  There is no excuse for this and there should be no chances to \u201cmake it up\u201d\u2026. I mean, how would one even begin to fix ABANDONING an injured person on a trail and then harassing you with notes?!  This mama bear would have handed that whole family their asses.", "NTA. Your daughter straight up said she didn\u2019t want to be with him and he straight up admitted they don\u2019t think they did anything wrong. They just want to clear the consciences, not the air.", "Nta, these people are unhinged. I truly hope your daughter has no interest in pursuing this relationship. Does she want to go on this dinner? With people who are not genuinely sorry? What is the point? To appease their guilt? Oh hell no. Don\u2019t give them any satisfaction.", "Wtf NTA. This family is massively selfish and you did good to prevent any further contact. They can go suck on a landslide.", "NTA. Of course you're not! That whole family is composed of selfish AHs. Keep your daughter away from them.\n\nETA: I've broken my wrist in a fall. It hurt worse than my c-sections. I can't IMAGINE leaving a stranger to suffer, let alone a friend. For four hours. That little weasel boyfriend and his weasel family can't, in fact, make this up to your daughter.", "NTA - you gotta mama bear! What they did was not okay and you were right to say and do what you did", "Oh wow...NTA.", "NTA!! Protect your daughter!! Stick with your instinct on this one, mama bear. Your daughter can learn a really important lesson here about what kind of treatment she should expect from a life partner. Do not show her that her wellbeing is not important.", "NtA. If someone did that to my kid I would\u2019ve broken his nose on the spot.", "Your daughter was hurt and they left her. I'm not sure where this hike took place, but, animals like wounded, injured/maimed things for dinner! \nLuckily, the ranger found her and helped her down the mountain. \n\nFuck those monsters! Get a restraining order and find out if anything can be done by the park/ranger.\n\nGet a statement/report from the ranger and make a report with the police. \nTHEY ABANDONED HER! An injured person and her \"bf\" didn't even stay behind.\nRise up Mama Bear and defend your cub!!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why would you give narcissistic gaslighters the chance to change your daughter's mind?", "NTA. \n\nAn adult is harassing an underage child and her family. Get legal protection.", "Nta. \n\nPress charges for harassment. The e, and his family need to stay away from your daughter and family.", "Nope. Nope. NTA at all. If your DAUGHTER wants dinner with them, then all of you have dinner together. The last thing she needs is her ex-boyfriend and his parents ganging up on her to tell her she overreacted.", "NTS. They abandoned her. She\nMight have died. You did exactly the things a daughter would want you to do, and they were harassing her.", "NTA! That kid and his family showed you they lack critical thinking and rational decision making skills in an emergency situation. They chose finishing a hike over taking someone in their party to the hospital for broken bones, and then left her ALONE in the wilderness while they continued their jaunt up a mountain. They wouldn\u2019t be allowed near my child again.", "oh. my. god. From the title I was expecting this to be a massive NTA. But you have to protect your daughter at all costs. I would have flipped out on the dude quite frankly.", "I'd sue the bf & parents for all medical expenses related to your daughter falling.", "Nope NTA.", "NTA. They are awful people!", "Absolutely NTA. What the actual f?!", "NTA. While ultimately your daughter is free to do what she wants, you're not literally stopping her. You expressed yourself to him. And it was seemingly in keeping with her wishes.\n\nYou should blast that family in comments of their social media hiking posts. JFC. I've got a 17 yo too and if it has been him I'd have done so.", "NTA\n\nThey valued finishing a hike over a hurt human being, and they don't even think they're in the wrong. You can't trust them to have your daughter's best interests at heart.", "NTA. This says a lot about his family and how he was raised. Anyone else creeped out about him going to her school and leaving notes for her?", "You need new friends. I can not imagine how much danger your daughter was in being left like that.", "NTA - That must have been terrifying for her. To be hurt so badly and alone.  If they don't understand what they did was wrong, no amount of apology dinners will make up for that.  I would want them to stay away too.    I hope your daughter recovers well.  <3.", "HELL NO NTA! Your daughter could have gone into shock and DIED! WTF? And they still hiked to the top? They're lucky you're not suing them. I would never let her get within ten feet of their irresponsible asses. Your friends are ridiculous.", "NTA.", "NTA and good for you !  and double good your daughter doesnt want anything to do with ex bf and family.", "You\u2019re NTA, his family is psychotic, and your friends are clueless and annoying. You are 100% in the right here.", "majorly NTA", "Holy Cows and chickens batman! NTA by any measure. I shudder to think of what would have happened if your daughter had an allergic reaction rather than pain and broken bones. \nNever in a million years would I leave someone else's child alone and in pain on the side of a hiking trail. That whole family, especially these parents do not deserve any accommodation for their actions. I would seriously be considering contacting an attorney.  The trauma inflicted on your daughter and negligence displayed by these people is horrifying. Those mutual friends can go suck bear skat!", "NTA. There\u2019s no way anyone could comeback from that with a simple dinner & apology. You never leave anyone behind on the trail, especially if they are injured. Yeah it sucks that their fun day was ruined, but this was a serious injury & should have been immediately dealt with.", "NTA and you go mama bear! Take their story and apology to the top of shut the fuck mountain. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/eDvBur8O6sc", "NTA - what the fuck? i don't usually pass judgement here, but what kind of deluded parents just leave an injured girl on a trail like that, and then FAIL to see where they went wrong?\n\neven if this situation was resolvable, i'd assume that the son has similar values instilled in him from his childhood, so other situations similar could occur in the future with his lack of empathy/critical thinking/common f\\*cking sense", "NTA. Child endangerment is an actual crime in many places", "NTA. When someone shows you who the truly are, believe them. This kind of cruel treatment is a feature, not a bug! Stay well away and make sure they don\u2019t gaslight and pressure your daughter behind your back.", "NTA you're protecting your daughter", "NTA- and this momma bear would have gone further and threatened legal action. Retraining order (they\u2019ve been blocked and have shown a pattern of continuing to try contacting you all) and charges for endangering her safety by abandoning an injured minor in the wilderness.", "NTA in my country you can get charged for willfully abstaining from helping someone who\u2019s in danger. \n\nShe could have died, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to run away if need be, I would never let these people close to her ever again.", "NTA \u2026 sorry your daughter got stuck adventuring with the Swiss Family Narcissist \u2026", "NTA, no matter what they say or try to do, nothing could ever make up for what they did.  They lack so much common sense and empathy that is definitely red flags x infinity.", "NTA and I strongly suspect they are trying to minimize what happened as a way of minimizing potential liability. Of the literal, legal kind. Posting all happiness from the top of the hike! No problems were had, see!?!? Lol. The park ranger left a paper trail and the medical record speaks to their negligence. His parents have sent him to love bomb/smooth this over. Tell them to (\u2026wait for it\u2026\u2026..) TAKE A HIKE! I suspect the dinner was to gaslight her or get her to say it wasn\u2019t serious or somehow her own fault.", "Not the ass", "Cristal clear NTA. They\u2019re not sorry, and the dinner has strong gaslighting vibes. \nAnd if they want to paint you as the bad guy to friends, feel free to explain the exact situation they are trying to sweep under the carpet.", "NTA at all. They left your daughter when she was majorly injured and anything could have happened to her. What if someone with bad intentions came along and she's there alone and basically trapped. They were so out of line. You did nothing wrong sending him away. At 19 he knew better than to leave her alone like that and not start taking her back down the mountain. Keep them all away from your kid however you need.", "NTA. Keep these horrible people away from your daughter!", "Wow.... NTA.", "NTA - Cannot believe they thought it was ok to leave her as they finished the hike. And to ask her to dinner to apologize....but say they did nothing wrong.", "Nta. Other commenters have correctly pointed out that you never leave someone in your hiking party behind. They put your daughter in a life threatening position, no hyperbole. \n\nAND.\n\nThey put other people on that trail at risk of having to take care of her. In many places in the US, if you\u2019re trained in wilderness rescue and begin care for a person, you\u2019re then legally responsible for carrying out the rest of the care/rescue so long as it doesn\u2019t put you in life threatening danger. What commencing a rescue looks like can be a little nebulous; does the duty to care begin if you offer some water? A hard threshold gets crossed if you touch the person. I\u2019ve been in this position in the backcountry with people who hiked and clearly weren\u2019t prepared. In addition to the risk and responsibility and at the risk of sounding callous, it\u2019s also really frigging annoying to ruin my time and put that burden on me or others when a situation could *easily* have been prevented (as opposed to something like your daughter being out alone and breaking her ankle and didn\u2019t have anyone to take care of her. Accidents happen.)\n\nBIGGER AND. \n\nIf you\u2019re in certain parts of the US, ex BFs family may have committed a crime:  another caveat of duty to care is if the person created the emergency. The BFs family brought her there so they may have had a legal obligation to care for her and see her care through until she was in the hands of qualified medical professionals. \n\nI\u2019m not a lawyer so take everything I wrote with a grain of salt. If this were me, I would be talking to a lawyer about whether that family bears potential criminal or civil responsibility for failing their duty to care. At the very least, remembering that when they whine that their feelings are hurt when you\u2019re pissed that they left your daughter potentially for dead or for literal mama bears.", "NTA but why on earth haven\u2019t you charged these assholes with willful engagement of a minor? \n\nThey left her Alone and Injured in the wilderness. \n\nMy mom would have speed dialed the police so fast the flash would have been impressed", "NTA was horrible people. I wouldn't walk pas a stranger who was injured hiking never mind walk away from someone I was supposed to be looking out for.", "Nta, I don\u2019t understand what kind of monsters would leave a young girl stranded by themselves in the middle of nowhere. I don\u2019t know what area you live in but where I live anything could have happened to her wild animals could have dragged her off and there would be nothing she could do about it. Even worse she could have been abducted by a creep. In my opinion those people are lucky that the ranger found her and not something else they were responsible for her safety and completely let her and you down. I would never let them near her again they are also certainly lucky you didn\u2019t press charges on them for child endangerment.", "NTA. She made the decision to break it off (a wise decision). It's over. Nothing to make up or smooth over. Bf and family need to move on.", "Notes taped in multiple places is psycho behavior. You need to tell them to stop and if they don\u2019t go to the police. She\u2019s a child and the fact the boyfriends parents don\u2019t think they did anything wrong is enough to not want her around them. Make sure your daughter knows she deserves to be treated better than that.

A couple of weeks ago her boyfriend (19M)'s family went on a day hike. They asked my daughter to come. All of them including my daughter love to hike. I didn't think it would be a issue and let her go. I was wrong.\n\n  From what the forest service guy told me. Along with what my daughter said. There was a rock slide halfway up the trail.\n\n My daughter fell and got hurt. Her boyfriends family decided to finish the hike to the top and come back later to help her down.\nEven after my daughter told them she was in horrible pain.\n\nAfter a couple of hours the forest service ranger (FSR) found her. He loaded her on a 4 wheeler and helped her down the hill. The FSR called me. I immediately came. We left a note on BF's car along with the FSR stayed in the area. To let them know my daughter was taken to the hospital.\n\nThe whole way to the hospital she was sobbing. Not only from the pain but because they left her. It deeply hurt her. She broke her foot/ankle in 3 places. She needed surgery. The 2 days she was in the hospital. They didn't check on her once. \n\nWe saw their post and photos on social media from the top of the mountain. Talking about what a great time they had.\n\nSeeing how hurt she was. We spoke to our daughter about what happened and what she wanted from this relationship. She told us she didn't want to be with her BF anymore. She sent her BF a text saying she was breaking up with him. After a flood of messages. we all blocked him and his family.\n\n6 days ago. We started getting notes taped to our cars, doors, some left for her in the office at school.\nYesterday ex BF came to the house.( I opened my main door but left my securityScreen door closed. talking through it.) \nHe asked if his family could take my daughter to dinner as an apology. Since his family didnt think what they did was wrong but, he loved her and his family wanted to clear the air between them. \n\nThis is probably where I am the A.\nI flat out told him he is not allowed to take my daughter anywhere.  I stressed Since he chose to leave my daughter when she was hurt. I no longer trusted him to be around her. Then shut the main door before he could say anything else.\n\nNow some of our mutual friends are saying I am an A for not allowing them to \"make it up\" to our daughter and closing the door on him. \n\nAm I allowing my mama bear judgment of this 19yr. old cloud the right thing to do here?\nAm I the A?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. It\u2019s hard to believe this is even a real story. Your poor daughter \ud83d\ude15", "NTA! There is no way to make it up. How could they just leave her there In pain. They thought they didnt do anything wrong I\u2019m sure if the roles where reverse they wouldn\u2019t be saying that. Ur friends are A too, do they have kids ??", "NTA at all!  Omg, I\u2019d have lost my mind!  \ud83e\udd2f. Leave my child - my INJURED child \ud83d\ude21- when they were responsible for her?!!!  You handled it with far more grace than I would have.  How did you not hunt them down and scream at them?  Call the police and report them for (something, because she\u2019s a minor in their care).  Post a photo of your daughter\u2019s leg on their stupid social media post of their \u201cwonderful hike\u201d and shame them publicly?!  No, they would never get within miles of my child again.  Awful people!", "NTA - you wouldn\u2019t be a good mother by letting her go to dinner with them. Sounds like an atrocious group of people and I\u2019m glad she saw herself that it wasn\u2019t the right relationship for her", "NTA, how irresponsible of those people. You don't leave an injured hiker alone. They are selfish and do not need any closure to assuage their guilt. I broke my ankle in 3 places it was excruciating and scary.", "NTA.  They had their chance to take care of your daughter.  You don\u2019t owe them anything.", "NTA. You're teaching your daughter standards.", "NTA- They left her behind?? In what world do you leave an injured person behind to finish a hike? She got hurt and nobody bothered to check on her. No \"apology dinner\" could make up for it. My bet is that the dinner would've been full of ex-bf and family trying to convince her what they did was okay.", "NTA! That was not only cruel and a real a-hole move of them but also more than dangerous to leave her for some hours there! Even if there wouldn't live wild animals  but what if a fat embolism after the fractures happened, and so on... Mama bear mode was really really appropriate. \nShe is 17, I don't know your laws, but I think some legal actions would also be appropriate. I think leaving a minor hurt in the woods is illegal everywhere on the planet.", "Wow I never thought I'd say this on a post with that title, but seriously NTA. You don't get to abandon someone in who knows what amount of danger with serious injuries and then try to sweettalk them into forgiving you with a dinner. They sound like total jerks and the bf is the biggest AH of all for not insisting on returning to her. That is not the action of someone who truly cares about his GF.", "NTA & Your \"friends\" are the type of unsuspecting parents we see crying on the news, who thought 'he was such a nice guy, how could he do something like this'.", "So I don\u2019t want to call you the \u2018A\u2019 as given the circumstances I\u2019d be absolutely furious but for me you are coming incredibly close, or, may have crossed the line.\n\nThe reason I think you may have crossed the line, at 17 your daughter is incredibly close to being an adult and I think you should of allowed your daughter to make the decision as to whether she goes for an apology dinner with them. I think it would have been ok to tell your daughter she doesn\u2019t have to, and, if you were in her shoes you wouldn\u2019t go, but I think you should have let your daughter chose.\n\nSo I won\u2019t call you the A as I think the BFs family seem awful but I think you need to empower your daughter and let her decide.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA, but you need to make it clear to BF and his family that all contact and attempts at contact must stop, and if the don\u2019t you will get the police involved.", "NTA. First off, the bf should\u2019ve stayed with her while the rest of the family completed the hike. The fact that he opted to leave her behind means he\u2019s not mature enough to have the responsibility of being in a relationship. Second, the family never contacted your daughter in the hospital so why do they care now?\n\nTell your daughter that she\u2019ll put them all on blast on all social media if they don\u2019t stop harassing her and your family.", "NTA. There are some things that you can\u2019t make up to someone, and leaving a badly injured girl alone to go and have fun is one of them. That ship has sailed for ex bf and family.", "NTA. What kind of pathetic excuse of a human leaves someone on the side of the road after a landslide with a broken ankle and is like \"please wait here, I finish the climb and will come back to you later\". WTF? What they did was wrong. 100% They left someone injuried,unable to run or defend themselves,alone, in the woods. There is nothing to clear here. You are absolutely right saying he cannot be trusted alone with your daughter. The mutual friends saying you are in the wrong are either missing some part of the story or are absolute idiots.\n\nEdit: forgot to point out one thing: I'm glad your daughter came back home safe as it could have ended up much worse. You daughter is also very lucky to have you because it's clear that you will support and help her. I hope she realises this.\n\nAlso if your daughter wishes to  properly close this chapter, it may be worth having a face to face talk with the BF, not for him but for your daughter? Just so she can get the chance to get things off her chest", "NTA.  Protect your kid from irresponsible narcissists.  Hope kiddo is soon on the mend!", "NTA. They LEFT her!  Enough said.", "The only not great thing you did is to make it sound like refusing them was **your** call.  It would have been better to say it was what your **daughter** wanted, and you were in total agreement and supporting her in telling them to leave.", "[removed]", "NTA that is absolutely disgusting behaviour from her ex and his family. you never leave someone alone on a trail when they\u2019re injured", "NTA. They want to clear the air, not apologize. They don't think they did anything wrong.", "NTA, they should be ashamed. Your daughter will be 18 in a couple months, hopefully whatever feelings she had for him will have faded by then.", "Nope, NTA. Forget that guy and his family", "NTA. I would be petty and comment on what they did on their social media post", "NTA. What did I just read? Yeah I would\u2019ve told them off too. I agree with others that it\u2019s time to tell your side. So glad a ranger found her and called you! Hope she heals quickly.", "NTA. That was so messed up what he and his family did.", "NTA. I think I might have gone even further and had it out with the boyfriends parents. What we\u2019re they thinking? What awful people.", "You are protecting your daughter from some people whom are not even equip with minimum amount common sense or empty. \n\nGood for you", "NTA. I can\u2019t stop thinking if a wild animal found her instead of a ranger.\nGood for you I would do the same.", "Honestly, i understand why everyone here is saying NTA. And you\u2019re probably not\u2026 or maybe a little hear me out. \nThe family did a horrible thing, absolutely\nBut the guy is just a kid, what does he know. \nHe seems to show remorse and maybe he has learned a valueable lesson. \nI\u2019d say don\u2019t the let the dumbass family get in the way of these kids learning life", "NTA\n\nI don't think you're going far enough.  I would press charges against them for endangerment.  Your daughter was isolated and defenseless.  She could have been attacked by a wild animal or even by another person.", "ESH. \n\nThe fact that not one of these people stayed behind to help her, but rather went about their day as normal means I wouldn't let any of them near my daughter ever again. Throw in the fact that they couldn't even be bothered to visit her in the hospital means they're genuinely not good people. They all lack common sense, good judgment, and empathy. I wouldn't let these deranged nuts even speak to her. I'd let them know that any further attempts to contact your daughter will be met with a protective order.  \n\nIt was going to be NTA until you described yourself as a \"mama bear.\" That shit is insufferable and automatically makes you an AH too in my book.", "This is what my husband said. My husband pointed out that the ex came when he knew my husband would be at work.", "This. Not only for the endangering of your daughter, but for the stalking with the notes too!", "Absolutely.  The 19 year old boyfriend is an adult and should have known better. And what on earth were his *parents* thinking??! I would not want any of these irresponsible people who lack common sense or basic compassion as friends.", "Our schools policy is if something is dropped off in the office for a student a parent must be notified if it wasn't the parent. We told them to throw them away. My daughter said she doesn't want to read them. They all say close to the same thing.\nHe loves her. Their relationship doesn't have to end this way. He misses her...", "I think that's why they approached our friends. For the show. They wanted it to sound like they were sorry and we are unforgiving. \nWe didn't tell our friends. I have been swamped at work making up my missed days. When our daughter was in the hospital and when she first came home.", "One of the notes said they didn't reach out because they wanted to give us some time.", "Our friends agree that they shouldn't have left her. They feel like how we handled it afterwards was unkind. I should have allowed them to make it right.", "Rigjt?! They abandoned her on a trail with broken bones FOR HOURS! Not allowing them to spend time with her is not mean or disproportionate.", "We didn't tell them what happened. It came from EX parents. They did say they shouldn't have left her hiking but, think the way we handled it afterwards was mean. That we should give them another chance.", "I agree. I feel like those people must have lied to the \u201cmutual friends\u201d or something and left part of it out. I don\u2019t get in what world any of that would be okay.", "AND took lots of selfies and showed the world how happy they were. What a beautiful day leaving someone behind injured\u2026", "This! Cut those \"friends\" from your life. Who would see this story and think that your daughter should've allowed him to make it up?\n\nThey are all awful people!", "I am in the US Arizona specifically. We have those animals along with Copper head snakes and other poisonous animals.", "Gotta get that selfie for social media yo. /s\n\nNTA. I can't even. So long as daughter is on the same page on no longer being interested in that person, Mama-Bear away, Mama Bear!", "From one of the notes. His family was excited to hike to the top to see the view. They were already halfway up and didn't want to start over.", "NTA exactly wtf, I wouldn\u2019t have left a fully grown adult I didn\u2019t even particularly like in that situation\n\nLet alone the 17 year girlfriend of my son!", "No, thankfully we have medical insurance. That covers 80%.", "God forbid she chokes during dinner, sounds like they'd choose to finish their meals before helping her.", "I didn't ask her about the dinner but, she did say he is calling her friends and she told her friends she doesn't want to talk to him anymore. So they blocked him too.", "I agree. Also, she will learn how to stand her ground and stick to her version of her story anytime someone tries to misrepresent facts and make themselves out to be better than they are. Clear the air with your friends, meet them all if need be with the photos and facts. The other family are clearly aware they've done something very wrong and are trying to avoid the social consequences of their actions by taking control of the narrative.\n\nNTA", "Not just animals. A freaking person could have gone off with her and she'd be helpless to stop it.", "I would have been more worried about hypothermia.\n\nMaybe they live somewhere hot enough it isn't a concern even in February, but what if the temperature dropped? What if it started to rain? She was dressed for hiking, which would have kept her pretty warm, not for sitting on a rock for hours.", "Alone and injured in a national/state park. \n\nIf you're in the States there isn't a Park without large predators - or at least venomous snakes. \n\nDitching her, with three broken bones, was wildly irresponsible and cruel.\n\nI'm*ANGRY*", "Agree.", "Also I would be sure to mention to her that ex-BF said he and his family still don't think they did anything wrong. What kind of apology is that? Is that even an apology? That just sounds like a \"we want you to not be mad at us, so we don't have to feel bad, and then maybe none of us have to deal with any consequences of our actions\"", "Not to mention she was left ALONE after being horribly injured where literally anything could have happened to her. Wild animals, strangers and she could have tried to leave and injured herself even more or worse - ended up going missing or dying. What the fuck is wrong with that family?????", "He\u2019s old enough to know you don\u2019t leave an injured person on a trail. Good grief! Any number of horrible things could\u2019ve happened to her while she was left alone. They don\u2019t think they did anything wrong.   \nCriminal neglect on the part of the family.", "This is not about kids learning life, 19 years old is plenty old enough to know that if ANYONE gets injured while doing any activity (hiking, soccer, biking or whatever) you NEVER LEAVE THEM UNATTENDED AND CONTINUE THE ACTIVITY. Especially if that person is crying and screaming in pain, like that\u2019s just common sense. This is coming from an 18 year old.", "That's fine and hopefully they will learn a lesson but it won't be op's daughters issue anymore.  She's 17 and was completely abandoned by a group of adults.  They don't get a second chance.", "The BF isn\u2019t really the issue here though, it\u2019s the adults in his life who thought it was ok to leave an injured person alone on a hike just so they could finish. That is deeply irresponsible, and OP is doing the right thing here. But beyond that fact, OP\u2019s daughter has been clear that she doesn\u2019t want the relationship to continue, so ignoring all the other red flags for a moment, the BF and his family need to learn to take no for an answer.", "That's probably also why the little weasel didn't show up at the hospital. Didn't want to run into an angry father.", "Your daughter is incredibly lucky, if she had gone into shock, this could have ended very, very differently. Thank God a ranger found her.\n\nTalk to your daughter about their relationship. I doubt that this was the first time something so reckless and careless happened. Ask if she ever felt unsafe around him, if he ever yelled at her or made mean comments, or if there was anything that happened with him or his family that made her feel weird even if she doesn't understand why. Ask if she feels unsafe now with him constantly trying to contact her.\n\n This is getting into harassment territory. Save the notes and any texts from him or his family as evidence, look up local stalking and harassment laws. Make it very clear to him and any of his family members who try to contact your family again that you view this as harassment and will pursue charges if it continues. It helps establish that you set very clear boundaries. These types of situations esclate very quickly, I remember when my ex started with leaving notes on my desk and it ended with a restraining order. \n\nI really hope it doesn't get to that point for yall, and I'm glad your daughter is home safe with you and your husband. It's clear you both care a lot about her and will support her and defend her when needed. That's great, and it makes a huge difference. You're absolutely NTA, you're protecting your kid and honoring her wishes", "You protect your child very well! I hope your daughter will feel and see it this way as well and knows she will always be protected by you and your husband. \n\nThe ex BF should be really ashamed of himself. And the parents as well. They are all old enough to know you take someone down immediately. \n\nI am glad your daughter will be fine. Wish her well from a random reddit stranger.", "That sounds like a good policy! This boy is not respecting your daughter's boundaries at all, and it's not okay. Good for her for ending things and standing by it. I hope you're able to resolve the situation soon.", "Gross! He is love bombing her and it is a tactic abusers use.", "A woman I know had this happen to her daughter\u2026  then the boyfriend came over uninvited one day after school and murdered her daughter.  \u201cBecause if I can\u2019t have her, nobody can.\u201d  It was in an upscale Midwest town, completely out of nowhere.  Everyone was SHOCKED.  The mom wrote a book, traveled the country, was even on Oprah.\n\nThe complete uncaring, unapologetic nature\u2026. It is scary.  Protect your daughter at all costs, OP.\n\nNTA", "Plus the borderline stalking when she broke up with him, from the entire family, is VERY WEIRD. What kind of people are both that careless with your kid AND that invested in preserving a teen dating relationship? It feels like they wanted her for a cult or something.", " Well. It's time to tell them. \n\nIn fact, it's time too tell ***everyone***\n\nI can't even imagine this. I cannot imagine a world where leaving a young girl in pain isn't evil.\n\nThese people are evil. \n\nName and shame them. Their behavior is bizarre and so far over the line.", "If these friends are worth keeping as friends, I would make sure they know the whole story. I'm guessing some parts were left out, like the whole, leaving an injured teenager alone in the forest. \n\nI'm not quite sure if these friends are even worth keeping though. They're immediately taking the BF's family's side without hearing your side of the story.", "You friends must be certifiable if they think you're in the wrong. NTA, at all!", "Seems that\u2019s their solution to everything - disappear and give it time. Good job protecting your daughter from this trash family.", "More unkind than leaving your daughter for dead on a trail?  IMO, nothing they do can \"make it right\"", "Nope protect and defend! Good mama bear! NTA! Ooo if that was my daughter..... I'm mad for you!", "I can't wrap my brain around this thinking. You absolutely handled this correctly. These people are incredibly awful human beings and they still think they have done nothing wrong.  Your daughter deserves so much better than this trash family have to offer. They are selfish and lacking in empathy. Good on you for standing up for her and supporting her through this.", "I\u2019m pretty sure that some people of my family happily would return the favor to that family of him. \n(And no, I don\u2019t agree with violence, but they will be pissed off enough to want to do it. Luckily smart enough not to)\n\nThey left an injured member of their hiking party intentionally behind. An sorry, kiss and make up is not possible", "They left her there and she happened to get rescued by the park staff. Y\u2019all are really lucky they found her too, because based off this story, I highly doubt they were looking all that hard for her on the way down. And then they didn\u2019t even care to see or ask about her until she dropped the bomb of breaking up with her bf. IMO they are just trying to save face.", "The only thing that could make it right, possibly, would be something like charges for neglect or failure to render aid etc. \n\n\nBut I am sure that isn't what they are willing to do when it comes to taking responsibility for the incredible danger your daughter was left in.", "Nope, your daughter made it clear that despite breaking her ankle, her spine is perfectly shiny.", "How?  How can they make this right?  They can\u2019t!  There is no apology dinner, no gift, nothing that can make this right.  They are awful humans who should never be trusted with the welfare of anyone\u2019s child again.", "They\u2019re currently in the midst of a harassment campaign against your family by leaving all these notes on your property. You are not obligated to be kind to people who behave so badly that it literally risks your child\u2019s life and then harass you for being upset about it. And if the notes are at all threatening, consider a restraining order.\n\nEdit: just saw in another comment that this boy is also bugging your daughter\u2019s friends to try and get ahold of her, which I think weighs in favor of trying to get the RO.", "Ask them how it's \"making it right\" to force her to do something she doesn't want with people she doesn't like? Who is that making it right for? Your daughter or the people who don't think they did anything wrong by abandoning her alone in the wilderness with a broken foot?", "There is no \u201cmaking it right.\u201d They left an injured teenager to continue their hike. What they did to your daughter is beyond unkind. You are absolutely NTA. And your friends are out of their minds to think you should have let her go anywhere near these people again.", "I wouldn\u2019t trust these people with my daughter if they were picnicking in my backyard and I was watching from the window.\n\nYou let them off easy. A lesser person would have humiliated them through social media. \n\nDon\u2019t let anyone make you doubt yourself and don\u2019t back down.\n\nTell Sir Galahad and his noble family to back off or you\u2019ll be forced to look into a restraining order due to harassment.\n\nNTA", "Taking her out to dinner isn't going to magically make it right.", "You should tell your friends what really happened", "Gee, I wonder how THEY would have handled it. Did you ask? Lol", "lmao tell them to FOH. They left an injured minor behind on a hiking trail, I assume remote enough her phone had no service so she had to wait for the ranger to stumble upon her.\n\nSomething is wrong with that entire family if every single one of them just kept walking. I wouldn't want to be around any of them, boo hoo if they think you're mean. I think they're whack.", "Wtf, they could have killed her???

Maybe because I recently watched a show about Alice Ruggles .... but this is how stalking starts", "Excellent, sounds to me like she wouldn\u2019t even go to dinner with them.  Just say no to them that she\u2019s not interested in their apology.", "Yeah I'm not saying that the daughter should feel in any way inclined to take up this invitation or accept the apology.  But she is old enough to choose if she wants to even hear it.", "Is he though? Is 19 years old enough to go against your entire family? Idk, you probably were a more assertive 19 year old than myself", "Boyfriend was old enough to know better. He should have stayed with her.", "Lol I think so too.", "This is very sound advice and I second everything you said. I really hope OP see your comment.", "That\u2019s not borderline. It\u2019s full on stalking.", "My first guess when I was reading it is their worried about a lawsuit.\n\nEdit spelling", "Thankfully she learned what type of people they are now instead of down the road.", "NTA and I\u2019m reading this while watching a documentary on Gabby Petito. Stay away from those people.", "My husband said I should. Also send photos of our daughters foot/ankle\nSo they can see first hand how bad she is hurt.", "Jesus Christ this!!! I would not be a rational or kind person if someone left my injured child alone and injured on the side of a hiking trail. Legal action would the least of that family\u2019s concerns because I am not afraid of prison.", "I am getting bad vibes from him. I was going to give it a couple of weeks to see if he moved on. Now I think we should talk to a lawyer and do a restraining order.", "I am not an assertive person even as a very grown adult, particularly with my family, but I would definitely have gone against them on this one at 19.
