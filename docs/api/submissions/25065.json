The first day or even week is generally to see how the work culture is, how your coworkers are and to establish a bit of a footing. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t appreciate the gesture, but it could be an awkward thing to do on your first day.\n\nOP you could have brought the sweets in at the end of the day and told her how you felt, she might have been understanding.", "NTA. I may be minority . Please listen me out . I agree with OP. This is your first day or week on the job . It is about you . You don\u2019t need to take your wife baked goods or kids Girl Scout cookies on the first day . You settle down , make friends .   Establish your self. You don\u2019t need to be introduced with baked goods . You don\u2019t need to be defined by that . You can make your own introduction .  After couple of months , you can introduce your family specials . I see. Nothing wrong with this approach.   How is it different from a mom accompanying to son\u2019s job on the first day .", "NTA. I agree that this situation could be awkward for you. You're probably already a little nervous. Jobs like that are where the crew basically becomes family but that takes time, you're entering a tight knit community and you don't wanna come off too strong. You need to feel the place out and I think that's reasonable.", "NTA \n\nFirst day of work and really the whole first week should be getting to know the group. Bringing in baked goods on your first day implies a bit of familiarity with the team that just hasn\u2019t been established yet. Second week would be more appropriate for bringing in the wife\u2019s baked goods.", "\u201cI hate it when a coworker brings in homemade baked goods for us,\u201d said no one, ever.\n\nI get you\u2019re trying to find your place at work and to fit in, but I think everyone at work would have been appreciative of the goodies.\n\nYou\u2019re acting like a middle school kid.\n\nYTA.", "NTA. This is a new situation and your wife could wait a week or two. You need to feel out and learn the group first. \n\nYou could have asked her to hold off before you started. Does she need praise that much?", "NTA  Only because of your profession. I'm the daughter of a firefighter and am very familiar with how things are at most stations. Would the fellas have enjoyed the baked goods? Probably. Would that prevent them from teasing you mercilessly and coming up with every baking related prank possible (ie flouring your sheets)? HELL NO. You definitely should have told your wife right away, but I don't disagree with you not taking the treats on your first day. If you did that they'd still be bringing it up in 25 years at your retirement roast.", "YTA, \n\nYou are not wrong, you just missed your timing. \n\nYou should have told her all of that when she handed you the treat instead of taking it and letting it get hot and possibly icky in your car all day. \n\nShe would not have understood earlier either, but the treats could have been given elsewhere.", "NTA - it\u2019s your workplace, your boundaries. She needs to respect that.", "Nta", "There's a lot of things that suck dude, taxes, being the rookie again, learning new people that sorta jazz, BUT BANNA BREAD AT WORK DUDE.    HELL YEA.", "NAH\nYour wife was trying to be thoughtful but surprised you, and you didn't know how to react in the moment. Talk to her about it and I'm sure you two will sort it out.", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from. But give them to a homeless person or something on the way.", "NAH- I love to send baked goods to work with my husband but there is a time and a place for that and it's not the first day of work at a new job! You have to get to know the group and get a feel for if it's even wanted. I also find out if there are any food allergies/dietary needs before baking for new people. It's just good practice.", "NAH. First days matter. \n\nYou\u2019re gonna want to be seen as professional and dedicated first of all. \n\nPlus you\u2019ll want to get a gauge on what kind of people and the vibe of the station before you do anything.\n\nThere are definitely places where bringing baked good will not be seen as a good thing and you\u2019ll be labeled as not taking your work serious. \n\nSo no you aren\u2019t the ass, but neither is your wife for doing what she thought was a nice thing for you.", "My image was of a kid on the first day of school, too. NTA. I agree with you", "Ehhh...NTA, but you could've handled it better\n\nIt's understandable not to want to walk into a situation you don't know/aren't established in with something that could be taken multiple ways, some of which are bad. Even if nothing would have happened, which is likely, you definitely don't need any extra anxiety on your first day. And your wife, who was just trying to do something nice for you and wanted it to be a surprise, didn't talk to you and so didn't know that. Given you were surprised with this before leaving for work, I'm not even critical that you didn't explain things right then.\n\nThe only potential problem comes in forgetting about it, causing her to find them, and then in how you responded. It seems kind of like you were trying to hide them even when you got home which would be a pretty silly way to go about things, and even if you just forgot (big first day and all), comparing it to \"bringging in something MOM made\" rather than saying something like \"I got anxious about it and how it'd be percived and needed to focus, so I left them. But I appreciate you working hard on them, thank you, and would love for you to bake more once I'm a bit more established\" was a bit rude of you. I don't think you intended it to be, hence my verdict, but let me just...explain a bit why she's probably still upset.\n\nShe worked hard on this, and was trying to help. She doesn't fully understand why it was an issue, but the way you phrased things makes it sound like SHE is the problem rather than the miscommunication about expectations or you getting worried being the problem. You likened her to a mother and made it sound like you thought she was infantalizing you for doing something that she's been doing for, presumably, years. Obviously, from any reasonable perspective, this is not her fault (I'm assuming you also recognize this given the tone of your post lol) but it probably feels like you're blaming her unfairly. You didn't mean that, and were trying to explain, but by adding in that example you made it about what she was doing rather than what you were feeling (a bit insecure at starting in a new place, not unlike a school kid, the analogy does work just gets overshadowed by the mom bit) and so she's probably feeling both like she messed up somehow and like she shouldn't feel like she messed up because it's not her fault and like you think it's her fault, all of which is pretty frustrating.\n\nHopefully, another conversation with a bit more care to your words to make sure they actually get your point across would be enough to sort this out. Just make it clear that you weren't upset about it/blaming her, and (if she brings it up) that you weren't trying to avoid/hide the issue, just not ready to put your thoughts into words that morning and too tired to remember when you got home. (If you were origionally planning to hide it...lie because that was a terrible idea and never do that again XD)", "YTA\n\nI'm a retired teacher. I can't think of a single school I worked at where teachers and staff wouldn't have descended on a plate of baked goods like a pack of orcs. And I would think firefighters would eat those cookies twice as fast with all the physically demanding work you do. I would have brought those cookies in, but that's just me...", "Oof!  I get where you are coming from, but instead of talking to her, you just... let her effort get wasted AND didn't do anything to prevent her from finding out, which hurt her feelings.  You probably could have kept them in the fridge/freezer for a couple days, or even weeks depending on what they are, to take them in.  Soft YTA.", "NTA \u2018cause you never know who might have an allergy.  Smart move OP.", "YTA\u2014 you let a weird childish insecurity wreck her kind gesture. Who sneers at someone bringing in treats? It\u2019s not like you\u2019d go around \u201chere\u2019s a cookie from my wife, she wants me to be friends. Please be my friend!\u201d", "YTA to waste your wife's homemade sweets when you could have shared them with other people, you were deceptive about it, and you insulted her.", "IDK, if my wife did that I would appreciate it and take them in. Not many people have a partner that can and want to take time to do things like that. At the same time I could see your PoV and not wanting to, if I was in my early 20s I would have been like that from fear of getting made fun of. I don't know what you felt at the time so I'll go out there and say NTA. You might get some shit for it since your new, but thats not always a bad thing.", "YTA\n\nNot for not wanting to take them in, but for not telling her that upfront.\n\n\u201cThanks, honey, what a lovely surprise. I\u2019d prefer to settle in and get to know my colleagues before bringing in treats for everyone. Let\u2019s enjoy these ones ourselves.\u201d", "YTA\n\nYou know you could have just thrown them on the table. No one would care where they came from", "YTA\nHow can someone be scared to bring homemade sweets??\n\nI am 30 and do this too! \nMy tip: Next time you can do this not directly on the first day but in the second week of your new job. Like this you know better about habits and preferences of new colleagues.", "YTA I agree with you that it isn\u2019t a good first day thing to do because you haven\u2019t gotten a sense of how things work yet. Once you are at least a little settled, then it\u2019s a nice gesture. But you could have just used your words and told her instead of hiding it and really poorly at that.", "YTA for not being honest with her. If you had told her that in the morning, I'm sure she'd have been disappointed but taking her treats and leaving them in the car was more insulting and probably made her feeling humiliated.", "YTA. You should have taken the treats in and gauged the reaction. I have no doubt that the others would all have been thrilled to get them. If not, then you don't do it again. \n\nIt was hurtful to your wife to do something nice and have you leave them sitting in the car. As much as your co-workers enjoyed the goodies at your last station, I have fully expect they will here, too.", "YTA. She worked really hard on those. You could have said \"Thanks babe. I'll bring them in tomorrow though. First day nerves\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Day One is specifically for reading the room and checking the vibe. You should have told your wife, though, that you were hesitant to bring anything in because you want a chance to actually meet your coworkers as yourself, and as the rookie of the group, you wanted to get a \"lay of the land\" before figuring out what was appropriate to share.
