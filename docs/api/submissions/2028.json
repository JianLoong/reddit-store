She absolutely knew that was a new bottle. Even if she didn't have to take any wrap off it was still full.", "NTA- she needs her own place too.", "NTA\n\nYour mom was out of line.", "NTA - It was your gift and most people want to enjoy a gift before someone helps themselves to it.", "NTA. I don't know why people are inconsiderate like that. She knows you were upset and hopefully she is more considerate in the future. It's done and it isn't ruined or all gone, so I wouldn't let it turn into a big deal. Happy belated birthday!", "NTA but expect this as long as she is there. Disrespectful.", ">She\u2019s now giving me the silent treatment for making \u201ca big deal\u201d out of this\n\nShe's 62, not 12, right?  This is not normal behavior.", "NTA. I am just like you with birthday gifts. Sorry she was disrespectful", "NTA. Things like this happen. She should've said sorry when she saw it upset you, but she seems too stubborn to do that and made it seem like you did something wrong. That is what makes her the asshole.", "Info: did she know it was a birthday gift before using it? Also how does food work in your house? Do you all go in equally or are thing\u2019s separate?", "Yeah, your mom was the asshole. That was disrespectful. She should apologize. You reacted normally for someone whose things were messed with.", "NTA.\n\nShe could have at least *asked* if that was okay or not. But noooo, clearly she should have everything OP gets regardless of OP's feelings about it.", "NTA.  Your mom 100% knew what she was doing or she wouldn\u2019t have deflected.  Not sure why she would do it, but she definitely did this intentionally.", "Of course she got defensive,  you were making a big deal out of olive oil. Not everyone fancies themselves a chef and foodie, so she may not have realized how crucial it was to you that you use it first. Is this really even about the olive oil? Two years of living in an apartment with your mom who is still young enough to take care of herself and live on her own (presuming she isn't ill or disabled) could cause some simmering tension.\n\nNAH taking the story at face value.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think she should have used it, but I do think it\u2019s not worth starting drama over. My mom gives me the silent treatment a lot unfortunately, but I love her to death.

Well I guess the good news is you will be prepared next time.  Fool me once . . .", "NTA. This is not a huge deal overall. But mom knew she'd likely upset you. Thats why she pulled those shenanigans - ie first deflecting and then lying and saying she thought you'd already used it. SMH. If she really had no clue you'd be upset, she'd have out right admitted what she did. And now the silent treatment...lol...mom sounds like she's drama.", "NTA. It\u2019s typically an unspoken rule that if you didn\u2019t buy it/it\u2019s not your gift, you don\u2019t use it/consume it until the owner does unless you ask first.", "NTA. More power to you sister for taking your mom into your house. I did the same thing once she couldn\u2019t live on her own. She got kicked out of 2 assisted living places. I thought my dad would have wanted me to take care of her. But between medicine and meals, I could never leave the house for long. The silent treatment seems to me your mom thinks she has the upper hand on you. Leave a couple of brochures of assisted living places laying around and see if she changes her tune.", "NTA.\n\n>she gets defensive and states that she thought I had already used \\[it\\]\n\nShe's lying. She had to break the seal to open the bottle. She knew. Do with that fact what you will.", "Your mom lies by omission just like mine does. NTA", "YTA. Your mom really did not think it through imo. For her, it was olive oil for cooking, kind of default action to open and use it.", "ESH. She probably didn\u2019t realize you wouldn\u2019t want her to use the olive oil. You weren\u2019t wrong not to want her to, but it sounds like you confronted her a bit harshly for what may have been a simple mistake.", "She was present when i opened all my gifts and when I opened this in particular, I ran to the kitchen and put it away with the imported oils I use. The counter is where I have the everyday items. And I do the shopping for food and she pays for her protein (I make different meals everyday)", "The fact that she deflected at first shows that she knew it was a gift and that she was wrong. I mean, how could she not know if a bottle had not been used when she opened it herself", "But if a Mom had a 30yo daughter who is a foodie and chef, shouldn't she have noticed her daughters interests by now?", "This also happened to me where I was gifted an expensive bottle of olive oil and I put it away where my roommate couldn\u2019t get to it ans later on I saw it out among the common oils (not opened\u2014whew!) put that shit right back where I had it originally, didn\u2019t move again.", "I guess my issue with this is that she by passed the open generic bottle of oil on the counter to go into the cabinet to get this one out", "If she saw you open it then NTA.", "But she might not have been deflecting. She might have really not know previously. Hence why I asked op the question. OP wording both implied that she knew about the bottle and that she didn\u2019t. I want OP to clarify.", "It was probably obvious from how the question was asked. Why else would anyone ask which oil was used if they weren\u2019t upset about the choice?", "2 years of living there should\u2019ve put this front and centre!!"]}
