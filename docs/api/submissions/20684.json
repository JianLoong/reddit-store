So now I\u2019m refusing to watch them at all. They think I\u2019m an asshole because I don\u2019t work and they do, so they think I should help them with babysitting. Also, they don\u2019t pay me for babysitting.

Your kindness is being taken advantage of. They wouldn\u2019t be allowed to do that with a sitter they pay without monetary consequences. They don\u2019t show up on time because they don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever put your foot down and you\u2019ll just be fine with it. I wouldn\u2019t watch their kids again without bringing this up and letting them know either you\u2019re going to start charging, or you\u2019re not going to watch them anymore.", "NTA; not even a sliver. They cannot honor FREE babysitting pick-up times. This is outrageous. You are not an ahole.\n\nMost day cares charge a late fee such as: $15 late fee arriving between1 to 5 minutes and it increases past this or $5.00 per every late minute.\n\nThey are exploiting your kindness and are not adulting. Yes, set a boundary that ends you being taken advantage of.", "NTA-SAHM doesn\u2019t mean you have no responsibilities and endless free time for others to take advantage of, if they expect you or anyone else to babysit they need to respect the boundaries you\u2019ve placed. If they don\u2019t want to respect them they need to find another sitter.", "NTA - Your kids are your responsability. Their kids are theirs responsability. They are just abusing you and being ungrateful.", "NTA.  They took advantage of you, and are now reaping the results.\n\nYou don't owe them your time, you already have two kids of your own to manage, +3 makes five.  Once or twice is an unfortunate circumstance, but every time means they do not value your time.", " NTA.  They\u2019re taking advantage of your kindness and your time.  If you were charging for late pick-up, they\u2019d probably be on time.", "I think it's better just saying \"*It's too much. You need to find childcare.\"* \n\n   Yeah,you could to say: \"*I can only babysit on Tuesday and Thursdays from 9 til noon!\"* or whatever\\~but I think he'd continue to take advantage. Someone who's expected **free** childcare, & is  consistently late picking them up is NOT going to be reasonable. He's going to bit\\*\\* and moan to guilt you into doing this.\n\n   He will be mad. He may try to keep his kids away from you. He may trash talk you to others.  But you AND your kiddos deserve to have your lives back, honestly!!", "NTA in the slightest. \n\nIf you\u2019re happy to help but sick of being taken advantage of, perhaps give them a set time limit ban (two-three months?) then offer a one-off babysitting moment as a trial run. If they are late to collect or otherwise don\u2019t meet a reasonable condition, never offer again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Stop being a doormat and let them know since they don't keep their end of the bargin they an fimd another babysitter.  Their child.  Their responsibility.  Not yours.", "NTA. You\u2019re not refusing to help. You\u2019re refusing to let them take advantage of you.

Cut them off.", "Nta tell them if they drop them off or dont pick up the tile they say next time  you'll call cps  on them because it is abandonment your not responsible for there children", "NTA. You were helping out and they took advantage of you.  FAFO.\n\nTime to declare yourself a reformed doormat! You can do it!", "NTA. They took advantage of you.", "NTA. They aren't being dependable at picking up their children,  and taking your kindness for granted. Their children are not your responsibility.  It's been very kind of you to help,  but they are not holding up their end.", "I wouldn\u2019t even bother viewing it as a late fee. It\u2019s straight child abandonment", "I like this approach.  It's a teachable moment, if brother is in fact a teachable person.", "NTA.\n\n\"Brother, the only asshole here is the person who believes they can drop their children off and leave them as long as they like. You seem to think I owe you childcare, when in fact, I have been doing you an enormous fucking favor, and I am not going to continue doing so when you cannot be relied upon to pick up your children at the agreed upon time.\"", "NTA. They didn\u2019t stick to the agreement - you wanted specific pickup and dropoff, and they flout that at every chance. They know they\u2019d owe fines out the wizzwazz if they pulled that crap with a daycare.", "NTA. Your brother played himself. \n\nInstead of abiding by your boundaries, he ignored them and worked his way out of free babysitting. That\u2019s on him, not you.", "NTA nest time he calls you an AH just smile and tell him you're actually an AH that doesn't watch his kids.", "NTA; call the police the next time they pull that crap.  It's very obvious they're taking advantage of you.", "NTA They couldn't follow the rules so they lost a babysitter. That's fair.", "Amen - to piggyback on your comment, I think she should have the brother pay a $50.00 down payment every time she babysits.   If he doesn't pick the kids up when he says he will, he forfeits the money.    If you were a paid daycare, you would charge him extra for not picking his kids up on time."]}
