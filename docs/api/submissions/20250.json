But I'm assuming your parents feed your siblings the rest of the time.", "NTA\n\nIf I understand right you cook something for yourself and they ask you to cook something different for them, so you're preparing at least 2 different meals. Would be different if they just ate what you're eating, since it is not much more effort to simply cook a larger portion of a dish but seems like this is not the case therefore they just have to suck it up. Maybe you can compromise to cook for them occasionally, when you've got the time and motivation (and when you don't have to buy some extra ingredients from your own money).", "NTA but why don't you tell them to ask your parents to purchase the ingredients?", "NTA- good gravy, I thought this was going to be a months long thing, but it was only 5 times! Not to mention it sounds like most if not all of them are old enough to cook for themselves (which they should be doing anyway). They were perfectly fine before you started cooking for them, they'll survive you stopping.", "NTA, there are plenty of options that don\u2019t require you to cook multiple meals a day for your siblings. All of those options will require the labour of others, it\u2019s a lot less hassle for them to bully you than do something to help themselves.", "The fact that you\u2019re a legal adult and one sibling that is OLDER than you expect you to cook their meals tells me everything I need to know. NTA", "OP your siblings are decently old enough already. Maybe you could offer to teach them to cook? This would ideally take some of that burden off yourself", "NTA you shouldn't be responsible for feeding your siblings just because you enjoy cooking sometimes.\n\nI can see making a little extra if you're cooking anyways so they can have some, but it's ridiculous that you're suddenly in charge of all their meals now when it's the parent's responsibility to keep them fed.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEY HAVE PARENTS.", "NTA, but maybe there is a win-win here.  It sounds like you enjoy the cooking part, but not the obligation and expense.

I wrote it in the paragraph, they cook breakfast, lunch and dinner so they're not starving or anything, and yes we all live in the same house", "Wait, are they each requesting a separate dish?", "Who's fault is that? They have working brains and bodies, I assume? They are definitely old enough to cook for themselves, time for mom and dad to get teaching. As for the 21 y/o, there's just zero excuse for them, they're just lazy and coddled.", "At 13 I was able to make half dozen easy meals and I knew how to read a cooking book. Those dishes were miserable but everyone has to start somewhere before learning more", "If it helps you mentally think of this as giving them a gift. They're close to the ages where they're going to be moving out soon enough. Knowing how to cook is a crucial life skill and you'd be giving that to them", "Look this subreddit is a bit reductive. You're not an asshole. You just made a bad choice.\n\nYou know you did that. So now make some good choices.\n\nApologise to the kid.\nGet some money for family food out of someone.\nMake a time to cook with them maybe teach them some stuff.\n\nWhatever you'll figure it out.", ">every one choses a different dish and I'm expected to cook them all for them\n\nThis is the issue here for me. If you are cooking for one, its not a huge amount of effort to cook for four. I'd rather cook for the whole family than just myself personally. \n\nThe extra effort is that they aren't just asking you to throw in a bit more of each ingredient, they want a different meal each. That is crazy, and in our house, they would just be told that if they don't want to eat what everyone else wants, they can cook for themselves. \n\nIf your parents were giving you money for ingredients and you were only making one large meal, it'd be different, but it appears you are the only NTA in the house. \n\nMaybe you can ask your parents for shopping money and then say what you are going to cook and ask how many portions you should make, but I understand why you are probably better off just refusing completly. That's a shame, but their own fault.", "Oh, definitely NTA then. If it was them asking to eat whatever you were cooking, I'd do that occasionally. But having them asking for multiple different dishes is a hard no.", "Then you're definitely NTA  \n\n\nIt shouldn't automatically fall on you to cook. Sure you can do it occasionally as the mood strikes you but it's unrealistic for your siblings and parents (The real AH here in my opinion) to expect you to cook for everyone each night. You aren't the parent, this isn't your responsibility", "Why are you paying for your own food? Or why are you expected to pay for your siblings food? How old are you?", "Wow NTA. I don't think your parents or your siblings get to make demands like that and your reaction is totally justified.", "Yea most of the times", "You're 100% right, ill start with the basics like eggs and if everything goes as planned we can start progressing to stuff like meat and pastas", "This makes so much sense\n\nYou should definitely make it a ground rule that you're only making one dish a day. They're old enough to help with the prep of chopping and learn how to make the dish - if that's what you're making/have decided on advance to make that day\n\nI think it might still be five ten minutes more time initially, but it might help you guys bond as well. Alternatively you could ask them to keep the prep ready before you come from the gym and have them help you/watch you in the actual cook\n\nBut limit the random restaurant demands maybe?  And keep the cooking lesson days to a few designated times a week or something", "Yea well said I agree with you", "Im 18 and Im the only one who works in the summer from my siblings, so I'm expected to spend my own money on myself since I have to be responsible now, for my parents, it's not that im expected to pay for them but it's that they're hungry and im making them \"starve\" by refusing to cook for them", "Oh yeah, no. You\u2019re not a restaurant.", "That\u2019s BS. No wonder you\u2019re frustrated and exhausted. NTA", "They eat three time a day. Your not starving them by not making a fourth meal In which they request different thing and don\u2019t even buy the ingredients.NTA"]}
