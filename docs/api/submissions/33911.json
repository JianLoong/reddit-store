Even if it is changes in hormones that have stuck around after pregnancy, being able to smell and feel someone\u2019s hot stinky breath when you\u2019re not a fan is unpleasant and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair for you to ask him to at least look into it or consider breathing through his nose.\n\nNAH I think, you\u2019re not wrong for asking and he\u2019s not wrong for breathing the way he breathes, but I do think he should at least be receptive to anything you both can think of to fix the problem.", "Does he floss at least two times a day?", "Good luck.\n\nMy ex used to breathe as though he was still in the shower after getting out.

You had to know this before hand and you still married him. You're not going to change him and this will just create problems.  Just slightly move so it doesn't bother you. If he asks why you shifted,  tell him your hair moving is not comfortable.  I get that you don't want to feel like you're riding in a car with the windows down while snuggling on your couch,  but it's your problem to fix.

This way he can read it on his own time and I don\u2019t have to feel like I\u2019m bothering him. This way I can say here, maybe check this out when you have a chance. I do really want him to be healthy and I do love him lots.", "do you think it\u2019s possible to have a hypersensitivity to one smell only? because i\u2019ve never had a general hypersensitivity to other smells (i have a toddler, we have a lot of smells at our house lol)", "Wow, everyone's being so mean to you, lol. \n\nI completely understand where you're coming from, and if your husband didn't used to breathe through his mouth, and suddenly started, I feel like it's something that should be looked into further.\n\nFor most people it's quite uncomfortable to breathe through the mouth constantly rather than the nose, so to suddenly change to doing that would suggest some underlying cause.\n\nAlso, yes, it can make someone's breath bad to breathe through their mouth all the time, because it dries out the mouth/tongue in a way that breathing through the nose doesn't.\n\nIf your husband honestly can't help it, then you'll just have to put up with it quietly, but if it's literally just a habit, and it's making his breath smell horrible, then it doesn't seem particularly unreasonable to try and get him to change the habit!", "Yeah, talk to your doctors about your hypersensitivity and focus on your husband's breathing. You're trying to deflect but you have to realize that it's not normal.", "Has he seen a doctor?", "Sure, in 30 yrs I never met one person who does that\u2026 everybody does it at least when they are sick\u2026", "for being so sensitive about it.

Why are you arguing and doubling down over an opinion you asked for?", "i\u2019m not arguing, i\u2019m giving insight. why are you so defensive?"]}
