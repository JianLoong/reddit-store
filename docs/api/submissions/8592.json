Something most people learn the hard way is the more work you do *without a promotion or pay increase* makes a promotion or pay increases less likely. Why would they make a lower paid employee manager and have to pay more and give more benefits when the employee is already doing the work?

You're not a manager. Just malicious comply like you are already doing, and don't stress about the things you use to do.\n\nIf you are really petty you can go up to the new manager and explain the duties you have been given that you are no longer able to do and wish to relay to the new manager. But only do that if you feel they definitely can't fire you.", "I think it would definitely be helpful to state what it is you do and what it is your boss expects you to do in order to qualify as a manager. If you ARE doing all managerial duties, to their liking, while being told you're not doing enough, then surely you wouldn't be TA.\n\nDoes your company have a job description for managers? Are there any other managers there? If so, how does their job differ from yours? \n\nAlso, perhaps there is someone else they would rather promote who has been there longer?\n\nAlso adding the fact that the regional manager wouldn't know anything about you being told that *maybe, perhaps* you'll be promoted.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, this was bad form and unprofessional. This person is new, doesn't know you, and this was a question that should have been a thousand percent asked in person and directed to the appropriate person. It comes off entitled to just be like \"when am I getting my manager's contract?\" in the form of an email when this person has never met you, doesn't know you, hasn't seen your work ethic. Why would this person know any of this or be able to tell you when you'll be considered for management? \n\nI'm not sure what it is you do, but people work up to managerial positions sometimes over many years. You don't just get a job and then not even two years later act like it's in the bag. People get told that they're being considered for promotions all the time only for it to fall through or get offered to someone else.\n\nGood chance you were given managerial tasks so your boss could see how you performed in that role, and thus far they have not been impressed enough to promote.\n\nOr perhaps they are taking advantage by making you work harder for less $$$. That's also not an uncommon tactic companies use.\n\nUltimately, refusing to do your job now is not a good look, and someone else said it: this is a good way to get fired. You don't want to be fired, because then you will have no avenue for using this company as a reference for a new job, and all of this amazing work you said you have done like turn a company around and implement company-wide practices will be overshadowed by: Oh yeah very unprofessional, didn't do work to desired standards, retaliated by no longer doing the job he was given, and was fired. \n\nHonestly, I would start looking for new employment and apply for jobs with the position that you are looking for. Use this almost 2 years of experience doing managerial work to your benefit on your resume. You don't have to be petty. But you can just flat out say, I believe the work I've done over the past two years has shown what an asset I can be for this company, but I don't feel I have any upward mobility here, so I'm giving my two weeks.", "Time for a new job.

My professional advice is to update up that resume and start job hunting.", "YTA. I can\u2019t see how you thought this was going to go over well. You did an end run around your immediate manager to ask her boss a question about your getting promoted. Not only that, but this person is new to the position & has never met you so has no idea of your work or whether you\u2019ll ever be promoted. Of course that was going to annoy your boss, a bad move since your immediate manager has a huge influence on your getting promoted. Your boss\u2019s feedback was, \u201cdo more\u201d, and your response to that was to do a lot less. That\u2019s the least useful response possible.

It is not the fault of a lone worker that you were exploited into making someone else's job easier.
