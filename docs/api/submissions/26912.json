The 3 kept walking away from me, walking all together but excluding me. \nTheir cover \u201cwe thought you guys would like this gardening stuff\u201d. With 4 months left in the rental we are in. I said \u201cI don\u2019t think we really need any of this\u201d then he bought SIL a $30 plant that I told him I wanted in the past and he said it was a stupid buy. \nI got annoyed but stayed silent and I think he could tell I was a bit upset about it because he then tried to say \u201cwell grab one too\u201d the other plants were looking poorly. \nI said \u201cno\u201d around 3 times before I said \u201cI said no, let\u2019s go already\u201d and he got angry that I got assertive. \nWe get in the car and he says \u201cwhy are you even mad?\u201d And I said about how he told me I couldn\u2019t buy myself 1 thing but he would go all out for them. \nHe said \u201cwell the garden is for you, so why are you acting like a spoiled c\u2022nt\u201d \nI told him I didn\u2019t want a garden. I didn\u2019t don\u2019t have the time. Plus I didn\u2019t even pick anything. Now I have to take care of a garden that they wanted because they were in the mood to buy things? \nHe told me \u201ci picked the worst person to have a kid with\u201d because in his eyes, I\u2019m acting spoiled.\nSo am I the asshole for getting upset that I\u2019m the only one not allowed to use our income for petty purchases?", "created_utc": 1694757350, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16j54gh/aita_for_being_upset_that_im_the_only_one_not/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sorry for those horrible things he said to you.\n\nHe's working, you're a SAHM. He brings in the money, you take care of the kids and do most of the housework. In your own way, you contribute equally to the household. This money belongs to the family.\n\nBy not letting you use this money, your partner has the perfect combo : a job, a babysitter & a free housekeeper. The money no longer belongs to the family, it's basically him working and you at his service.\n\nI find the way he talks to you alarming, as well as the fact that he immediately refused to let you work when it would have contributed to your happiness. He treats you like a burden when without you, he wouldn't be able to work and earn that money he cherishes more than his wife. You deserve to be in a relationship with a man who respects you.", "NTA. It's time to get yourself back to work whether he likes it or not. You need your own money and your own independence because at some point, you will end up leaving as his behaviour is abusive.", "Honey do you have anyone you can turn to that might be able to help you get a safe place to stay that wouldn\u2019t be known by your partner\u2019s family? Or know of any organizations that might help you should you leave your husband and his siblings? \n\nHow he is treating you is not ok. You should be able to work and do whatever you desire as a human being, but your partner seems to be financially trapping you. His statements to you and disregarding nature are also signs of abuse. He\u2019s treating you like you\u2019re a pet, things like this garden being \u2018done for you\u2019, speaking over you as if you\u2019re an animal and not a human being. That\u2019s how I\u2019m reading it anyway. \n\nIf you have family on your side who you can trust please reach out to them for support on all of this. And again, support services for familial abuse. I\u2019d say counseling but he\u2019s disregarding your comments and desires from the outset, so he has a power over you and he\u2019s very happy to use it.", "Just to add: \nThey were talking about me while I was putting our toddler in the car, when I confronted my partner he said I deserved it. \nThey are at our house all the time, creating dirty dishes, using our stuff, leaving us with mess and I\u2019ve had no alone time with my partner for weeks because of it. \nI\u2019m not a social person on a good day so day in and out of having people over is too much for me. This felt like the last straw for me.", "Your husband is financially and emotionally abusing you.", "NTA red flags", "Your husband is a financially and verbally abusive asshole.  You need to go get a job, get yourself sorted and get the hell out of dodge.  Nobody deserves to be treated like that.  NTA but you are to yourself if you stay", "NTA. Me still wondering how people end up in these abusive ass relationships. Just leave his ass.", "Do  you want your child to grow up thinking all of this is how normal families work because it isnt?  Its time to take a stand, grow a spine and say enough. Start looking for job opportunities for yourself , day care and a place to live for just you and  your daughter. Find out about child support  and whatever else you may be entitled to financially  this is financial and emotional co trol and is very unhealthy.", "Please update when you have left him and your happy because I think you will be leaving", "Nta. I would leave as soon as you can. This is financial abuse. He also sounds like a huge asshole. There were many red flags in what you wrote. Idk if you have friends you can try to lean on for a bit or family, but I really hope you are able to take yourself out of that situation. It will probably get worse if you dont", "NTA-\nIt seems that your partner is obsessed with showing off how much of a man he is to everyone besides the person who deserves it the most, you. What he's doing is compensating. And, those two family members have found this out and are taking advantage. He's buying affection and seems unaware. As long as they applaud him and make him feel superior by insulting you, he'll buy them things. Him not allowing you to work and demeaning you when you point out the issues you have really showcases this. He's addicted to the fantasy he's created.", "NTA - if this is how you want to live that\u2019s your choice.  \nI always say to someone in an abusive relationship \u2018do you want your child to think this behaviour is normal or ok ?\u2019", "Nta this is financial abuse. Get a job asap and start a separate savings account to protect yourself.", "Get rid.\n\nYou're pissing in the wind with this clown.", "Nta. Get a job and get into therapy asap.", "NTA\n\nHe's financially abusing you, and you know it. One of the ways he does that is to make it seem like you're the one with the problem. \n\nYou could try to work through this, but in my experience, once a person starts abusing you, they will never stop. You definitely need to start working again and perhaps start planning an escape. (Ironically, this is what he is afraid of and why he won't give you money or let you start working again).", "NTA. \n\nThis financial abuse, and you are letting it happen. He can not stop you from having a job. \n\nSide note, it sounds like he may be in love with your SIL. Or just a really unhealthy relationship with his brother. \n\nWhy are you still with him? \n\nI can not stand stories like this. You are a victim of your own making by not changing your situation. I ran from my ex with my kid and -$5 in the bank because he took all my money and degraded me. It can be done. \n\nGet a job and leave!", "Maybe time to go it alone looks like you do everything anyways then if you want to get back to work he will have to help", "WHY ARE YOU STILL AROUND PPL WHO TREAT YOU LIKE THIS?! GO GET YOUR MONEY AND LEAVE", "NTA, but you should leave him immediately. He's seriously emotionally, verbally, and financially abusing you. If you can stay with your family or find resources for abused women, you really should. You've been doing all the hard work in the family, raising the kid and providing all the house care, it's only right that you should be able to spend money on things you want or need. If he's spending all the money on his dumb siblings instead, that's a major red flag too.\n\nMove out, get full custody of your kid, and build your new life. Find a safe place to live and maybe see if you can do some kind of remote (work from home) work so you can save money on daycare costs, or see if a family member can watch the kids while you get set up with a career. Whatever you do, don't give this abusive creature what he wants, which is to control you.", "Wow. Financial abuse is real here. Tell him what your services are worth and if he cannot make good for them then you will be getting a job and he can pay for sitters & housekeepers if thats what he wants. NTA.\n\nAlso, never stay with a mxn who will speak at you like your value is less than his. You can have an equal or an ex.", "You're in an abusive relationship.\n\nHe doesn't want you to work but his money is his money.\n\nHe insults you when you try and stand up for yourself. \n\nHe demeans you and prioritizes HIS brother over YOU(His flipping wife). \n\nNTA. Please look into getting a job so you can have your own money for your needs.", "Is he married to you or them? NTA.", "Once upon a time, women didn't work as it was socially unacceptable, but they were given \"pin money\" in modern terms, a discretionary allowance paid on a regular basis. This was separate from the household accounts that paid for the house, food, and clothing for the people living in it.\n\nYou need to revisit your finances, because it is absolutely unfair that you have no funds for discretionary spending. Many couples have an agreement about personal spending that X amount is fine, but above X needs clearance with the other partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he refuses to be reasonable, I would advocate for a return to work, even if it's a shitty parttime job that you can do on evenings or weekends when partner isn't working (assuming he has standard business hours) - or at some time when he isn't working. Just something a few days a week so you have pocket money.\n\nNTA", "I've read your other post. There is a reason he won't let you work, and belittles your chances of finding work. The only thing keeping this dynamic as is, is your need for his financial support. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook this is a shit situation, you KNOW you're not an asshole, any ONE of these statements from my spouse and I would have set fire to everything, and watch it burn\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou NEED to become financially secure, any job, work ANY job, nights, mornings, factory work, cashier, ANYTHING it doesn't matter, money is money. In your other post you said you were just staying for your kid, there are two options 1) your kid will watch his dad and follow in his footsteps 2) your kid will also be verbally  bullied and emotionally neglected just like you are being right now, and will hate his childhood. You sound like a very dedicated parent, and I know you want to give your child a good life, it won't be with this man.   \n\n\nI dont know where you live but in most countries as a mum and a SAH wife, if you divorce there will be some sort of compensation, splitting of assets, child support and alimony, you won't be left high and dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou said in the comments you're going to a family member, use that time, when you get there, get a job, get a lawyer, and don't go back. You can do this! He keeps telling you what you can do, but from your posts and comments, you sound like a very patient, and tolerant woman, you were strong enough to tolerate his BS you're strong enough to pick yourself up and move on! you have skills! you have the capability to do what you set out to! Don't believe the narrative he says, you're not put on this earth to follow his will. You can get out, for you and your child. And who knows maybe you making moves, will  be the wake up call he needs, to change or go to therapy or whatever, he'll know he can't keep you down like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nobviously NTA, but you don't need to live like this", "I am extremely upset with how he spoke to me, I\u2019m also feeling the part of what you said when you said he has a live in babysitter/maid type thing. \nHe lives a free life while I\u2019m the one doing everything to keep the family going outside of financial", "Thank you, this is such a kind comment \ud83d\udc95 \nI\u2019ve spoken to a family member and thankfully will be able to stay with them short term to get on my feet again. Will be in about a month or so though until I can. \nI feel trapped, he knows I am, it\u2019s almost like a game of who will leave first and he won\u2019t make the move and I\u2019m physically unable too as I\u2019m not able to support my child and i at this point :(", "I'm sorry but why are you still subjecting yourself to this? What you're doing as a SAHP and the additional mental and physical workload for 3 adults are way difficult than having a job. Please reconsider. And if you stay out of the workforce a little too long it will be more difficult to come back so again please reconsider.", "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s abusive because he isn\u2019t physical with me in an aggressive manner.. I think it\u2019s also silly to think people willingly stay in these situations. I have no money to leave", "I\u2019m overdrawn -$100 in my account. I have a car loan that\u2019s currently on hold and due to commence again soon and literally not a single applicable skill outside of work I\u2019m no longer physically capable of doing.. leaving seems easy but putting my toddler in the position of homelessness where I can\u2019t provide for them isn\u2019t something I would ever do to him. I understand your pov, but realistically, I can\u2019t even afford the petrol to drive to a family member.", "Ask yourself if your child had this type of partner, what would you think? Is this really the life you want to live and the example you want to give? Speak to him until he understands and if he doesn\u2019t, take more serious measures, because he is draining you mentally and emotionally", "And this is why people call it abuse. It\u2019s financial abuse. You have no money to spend how you want. It might not be much at first but slowly he cuts your spending then it\u2019s \u201cyou have $50 for groceries\u201d, and he nit picks what you buy and complains you didn\u2019t get what he needed, when he didn\u2019t give you enough money to begin with\nEmotional abuse. \u201ci picked the worst person to have a kid with\u201d or \u201cwell the garden is for you, so why are you acting like a spoiled c\u2022nt\u201d. These things tear you down. They beat you down. They make you feel like less of a person or that you are somehow wrong or worth less. \n\nAre you seeing the issues yet?  He will buy his family what they want but not you. Aka you\u2019re not worth spending money on. Will only buy you something you asked for after some else asks for it. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t recognize your worth. Therefor you\u2019re not a team. Parenting is a team. Marriage is a team. Everyone has to pull weight or it just doesn\u2019t work. You give it 100% and they give it 100% and it\u2019s easy because you\u2019re working together, you\u2019re only using 50% because they\u2019re carrying the other 50%. But that only works when you\u2019re going after the same goal. When you\u2019re working together and appreciating the other persons efforts. \nHe\u2019s doing the money work and you\u2019re doing everything else. He gets the benefit of the clean house. The cared for child and more. But you very little of what his work is, aka the money, because there is no other benefit he brings. Because he doesn\u2019t seem like good company treating you that way. Calling you a C-nt. Sorry if I want to be called that. I\u2019m going to earn that.   \n\nNTA.", "Just remember that in the grand scheme of things he only has power in his little sphere. You have support and the entire biosphere that isn\u2019t him, his garden and house and siblings. Alright? \n\nAre you guys married or not? Just for consideration of organizing documentation for family court and custody. You should definitely document the behaviour up till now so you can use it as evidence if you need a restraining order or anything else happens anyway. \n\nAfter leaving things below: \n\n>> Make sure your kids know what is going on in the most age appropriate way though so if he tries to come for them they will know not to go with him. You can educate them without demonizing (for court reasons again), and that is key to this point though. Kids are smarter than it seems as well, (and also), they likely have witnessed some of the behaviour too and might have normalized it. So it\u2019s important to educate with that support you have on why how you\u2019ve been treated isn\u2019t ok and why you\u2019re doing this\n\n\nCan do some of this stuff below now for interim stage between staying with relatives. Or another family member to give a space so you can stay before that turn around stage if your partner knows you\u2019re gonna leave. \n\n>> Again, reach out to familial abuse services or family disruption support lines and they can likely help with getting the support needed to ensure you can get on your feet without debt and that.\n\n\n**Edit in case you read**: Ah! I am uncertain if you mean you have gotten out or will get out. \n\nAll of the above is for when you are out. \n\nIn which case you likely still get get that support as well to have a place to stay before you can stay with that relative, again by family abuse support systems. If your partner knows you are leaving you gotta make it known to those who can prevent violence of retaliation or anything.", "Yea, no, that's still abusive. Abuse doesn't have to be physical. People end up in these relationships because they keep lying to themselves about what's abuse and what isn't. No need to make excuses for him.", "It is abuse. Just because he doesn\u2019t hit you doesn\u2019t mean he is not abusive. He demeans you, insults you, refuses you access to family finances, lets others treat you poorly. How is that not abuse?

There are many different kinds of abuse. Financial abuse is one of them. \n\nJust because other types of abuse don\u2019t leave physical wounds doesn\u2019t make them less serious, or less abusive. \n\nPlease do some reading.

He isn\u2019t letting you have any of y\u2019all\u2019s money and also not letting you make your own money.  That keeps you trapped.  And that\u2019s abuse.", "Financial abuse is a thing. So are verbal and emotional abuse. Maybe do a little digging online and see if his behavior matches the definitions. Pretty sure what he is doing is a textbook example of financial abuse."]}
