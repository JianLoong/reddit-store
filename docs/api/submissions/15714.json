You\u2019re family wants you to cut ties with your friend because her mother is a stripper? But doesn\u2019t care that your brother goes to strip clubs and spends money watching her dance? \n\nIt would be petty to tell the gf but I say do it, he\u2019s threatened to break your phone and is acting like an AH. The gf deserves better.", "That girl deserves to know the family she is marring into, it\u2019s only fair if you do it!", "NTA.\nThe hypocrisy is unreal! Brother goes to strip club, but you can't know the daughter of one of said strippers", "I feel like focusing on if you'd be TA here is shifting away from a larger concern. Your family is obviously highly controlling, trying to isolate you from your support system and weird toward you already, and your brother threatened to break your phone. So, as a formerly abused kid I feel the need to point out that you reaching out to the gf may cause a large escalation in the way your family reacts, and you need to weigh the potential consequences of that against the benefits. Breaking your phone is a violent act. Do you know for sure that he wouldn't get violent with you?Morally you would not be TA here at all imo. But your focus should be on your own safety first", "Go ahead and do it.  You wouldn\u2019t be wrong, but given your family\u2019s despicable behavior I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it backfires.\n\nYWNBTA", "YWNBTA\n\nthe double standards and the misogyny. smh", "Tell the girlfriend", "YWNBTA", "No, you wouldn't be the arsehole. In fact, if you weren't 14, I would say you would be an arsehole for not telling your brother's girlfriend that you went to a strip club, because yes, she deserves to know. However, since you are 14, I would say it's not your place or responsibility to get involved.\n\nStrip clubs are, generally speaking, not nice places. The men who go there are sleazy (hence why I think your brother's girlfriend deserves to know), and the women who work there are often there because something's gone seriously wrong. This isn't always the case, especially if someone is working in a strip club for a short time when they are young, but if your friend's mum is in her 30s or 40s with children, and working in a strip club, then they are likely to have problems with drugs or alcohol and at worst might have problems with pimps or otherwise unsavoury men hanging around and taking advantage. So I think it's understandable that your family might want you to avoid being around your friend's mum, but I don't think it's fair for them to ask you to cut your friend off.\n\nIt sounds like your family blame women for finding themselves in the situation where they need to take their clothes off for money, but don't blame the men who go to the strip clubs and pay money to see those women. It's a pretty disgusting double standard if you ask me. I would just stay out of it if I were you, keep seeing your friend, don't tell your family about it, but do be careful around your friend's mum, especially if you suspect any of the issues I mentioned are at play.\n\nDisclaimer to say not all strippers are in a bad situation and are stripping as a last resort, but realistically this is the case for the majority of women in the sex industry, especially the non-online sex industry.", "Do it. Do it. Do it.", "Info: Did he go to the club while he was with his gf? If so, you would NTA.", "ESH\n\nYou'd only be ding it because you're being petty about them telling you to drop your friend... and I'm all for it lol.\n\nYou would join them in being an AH though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And also the prejudice against a woman doing a perfectly legal job in a perfectly legal place is pretty off. \n\nAnd if you do call, tell her about him threatening to smash your phone too.", "Ywbta. You're acting out of spite, against the express wishes of your family. Stay in your lane, if your brother wants to make poor choices that's for him to deal with.", "YWBTA \n\nThis all comes back to the age factor. You're 14, so underage, and they have every right to say you shouldn't be near people who work in strip clubs because they can't know what type of discussions or things could be present at her house. It doesn't mean I agree, but I understand them. \n\nYour brother is 30 and went there for a bachelor party, not because he frequents it regularly. \n\nPlus, the main reason for me is that you just don't interfere with your siblings' love life. I'm sure you'd hate it if he ever did so with your boyfriend. This is not a situation serious enough to possibly ruin his relationship with his gf. He wasn't cheating, he was attending a party.", "NTA.  Time to air the dirty laundry, especially since your family is so upset, they need to be upset about everything, all at once.", "You're too young to be dragged into this.\n\nI would say, stay out of it as much as you can. Maybe tell them you won't cut ties with your best friend and them & ur brother better be nice to you, otherwise his GF may get wind of the whole thing.\n\nThis is not a question of you being an AH or not. You're not an adult and basically rely on your parents and family. If you tell his GF (even if it's the right thing to do) you will likely create a very hostile living environment for yourself and be stuck there for quiet a while before you can get out.", "I would agree if OP was an adult but she's 14 so I don't really think it's her responsibility", "This needs to be the top comment. Please be careful OP!", "Why can\u2019t sister make her \u2018poor\u2019 choices to deal with then? Because she\u2019s a \u2018kid\u2019? That kid probably has more sense than the whole family out together", "Doesn't mean he has to threaten to break her phone. Controlling and hypocritical family regardless.", "Neither do I but she wants to do this", "Yeah, but I don't blame them for saying a 14 yo shouldn't be near strippers.", "She isn\u2019t???? She\u2019s friends with the child of someone who works as a stripper? They aren\u2019t constantly stripping everywhere for crying out loud? She\u2019s a parent as well.", "This is honestly the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. You\u2019re telling OP she shouldn\u2019t be around her friends mom because she\u2019s a stripper? \n\nStripping is her job, I doubt she walks around the house wearing her underwear and saying inappropriate things to the kids.", "It\u2019s not like she\u2019s hanging around drug dealers! The family is way out of line here.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with choosing to be a stripper, and OPs family is not only hypocritical but also a-holes for being fine with her brother going to a strip club while demanding that she drop her best friend simply because their mother works at that club.\n\nNTA OP"]}
