WIBTA if I called her and said that he went to a strip club without telling her and asked my family to hide it and they agreed?\n\n\nEDIT:. ####    The very first post I made on reddit was some hours ago I made this post and it's about of i was the ah for lying to my family about her mom's job.I will just copy and paste it here for the complete context. My family has never raised their hands on me or  made me feel unsafe  but my brother really do threaten me every time he thinks I am not listening to him and tbh till this incident I have never made them this angry and some of the comments do scare me like what if my family is just terrible and I just was ignorant and I haven't decided yet if I should tell my brother's gf or not. She will come to dinner this Friday so I guess I could just slip it into her accidently like i dunno.\n\nCOPY PASTE of my first post\n\nAITA for not telling my parents and siblings that my friend's mother is a stripper.\n\nI am 14(f). My friend 14(f) is a scholarship student and very nice.she joined this term.We became friends after being teamed up on a project. She comes from a single mother household and when we became best friends she told me that her mother works as a stripper and she also do part time job in a cafe.I did tell my family I made a new friend and told them how she is a scholarship student and all but didn't tell about her mom bring a stripper as she told me that in confidence. So I told them how her mother works in a cafe .I have 2 siblings, a brother and sister who are both 14 and 16 years elder to me and both of them and my parents work in the same firm so  they often go to work trips together.Usually my grandma comes and stay with me but this time she didn't bcoz of arthritis so it was just me & house help.it was a weekend so i called my friend over for a sleepover after asking permission from my parents. She stayed for 2 days and my family came home too and my mama insisted my friend to stay for dinner and my sister was also impressed how smart she was and then her mom came to pick her up later even though she refused my mama and dada insisted her to come inside and gave her cocktails. But the moment they left after that my brother told my parents that she is a stripper in a club and he remember seeing her when he went to his friend's bachelor party.Suddenly everyone was angry and my sister asked me if I knew and I got scared and I said yes. Now they are blaming me for lying to them about her job and my brother told me he will break my phone if I don't behave and stop making wrong friends. My dada told me that I broke his trust by lying and then bringing them both to our house and my sister went through my whole room searching I dunno what she was looking for. I never thought her job could be such a big deal if my brother can go to watch strippers and still live in the home why can't the same stripper come to our house? Ofcourse I didn't ask this to any of them, I don't dare to. My mama told me she would never let me have a sleepover ever again until I apologise to all of them and stop being friends with her which I don't want to like am I the AITA ???\n\nEDIT EDIT : I decided keep my mouth shut bcoz I just saw a highlighted comment and it made me realise if my family really turn against me for this matter rest of my life would be miserable . I'm supposed to work on the same firm so like my entire life. I won't cut ties with my bff, I will just lie to them just the way they will lie to my brother's gf I guess. I do feel like a coward but I'm too scared I guess.", "created_utc": 1682501822, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zc8ep/wibta_if_i_told_my_brothers_gf_that_he_went_to_a/", "score": 555, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your family is obviously highly controlling, trying to isolate you from your support system and weird toward you already, and your brother threatened to break your phone. So, as a formerly abused kid I feel the need to point out that you reaching out to the gf may cause a large escalation in the way your family reacts, and you need to weigh the potential consequences of that against the benefits. Breaking your phone is a violent act. Do you know for sure that he wouldn't get violent with you?Morally you would not be TA here at all imo.

In fact, if you weren't 14, I would say you would be an arsehole for not telling your brother's girlfriend that you went to a strip club, because yes, she deserves to know. However, since you are 14, I would say it's not your place or responsibility to get involved.\n\nStrip clubs are, generally speaking, not nice places. The men who go there are sleazy (hence why I think your brother's girlfriend deserves to know), and the women who work there are often there because something's gone seriously wrong. This isn't always the case, especially if someone is working in a strip club for a short time when they are young, but if your friend's mum is in her 30s or 40s with children, and working in a strip club, then they are likely to have problems with drugs or alcohol and at worst might have problems with pimps or otherwise unsavoury men hanging around and taking advantage. So I think it's understandable that your family might want you to avoid being around your friend's mum, but I don't think it's fair for them to ask you to cut your friend off.\n\nIt sounds like your family blame women for finding themselves in the situation where they need to take their clothes off for money, but don't blame the men who go to the strip clubs and pay money to see those women. It's a pretty disgusting double standard if you ask me. I would just stay out of it if I were you, keep seeing your friend, don't tell your family about it, but do be careful around your friend's mum, especially if you suspect any of the issues I mentioned are at play.\n\nDisclaimer to say not all strippers are in a bad situation and are stripping as a last resort, but realistically this is the case for the majority of women in the sex industry, especially the non-online sex industry.", "Do it.

Im so glad that you recognize the hypocrisy here, YWNBTA, and you would be in the right to be transparent with the girlfriend, however, just attending a strip club, isnt actually that big a deal, like, your partner should absolutely be honest with you and its not something you should keep from them, but its not anything remotely close to cheating, its literally just walking in a building, where a boob may be out. My only point is that its not a moral imperitive to disclose this to the GF and I really dont think you should, because even though its the morally correct decision it will blow back on you in a really big way and damage the relationships you need to survive. Just focus on growing up to be a good person. I hate how this sounds but from the way you describe your family's behavior, it's best for your future to just keep your head down and focus on learning how to be independent and healthy, and dont make waves with the family who's support you will absolutely need to thrive in this world. Take note of who they are as people, always remember it, and make smart choices for your future. Let it go, take no action, but remember what this says about who they are.", "NTA but you need to highlight his abusive behavior to her as well", "Your brother is afraid your friend\u2019s mom will see him **frequently** at the strip club, that you will find out, and tell your family.

Would you say the same thing if she was just posting pics of her feet to OnlyFans?  What if it was a single father working at a Chippendale's?  This social stigma surrounding sex work is incredibly damaging with roots in misogyny and needed to end an eternity ago.  The daughter doesn't deserve to be ostracized from her friends because of her mother's perfectly legitimate means of earning a living.\n\nBesides, if the brother was simply attending a bachelor party for his friend and nothing more, he should have no problem with his girlfriend knowing about it.  Instead, he decided to lie about it, getting his entire family involved no less, and now his dishonesty is the crux of the issue.  Additionally, I don't see someone who threatens to break his sister's phone as being a loving, caring partner so she'd probably be better off regardless.", "I wouldn\u2019t venture to say how the majority of people feel as I\u2019m sure my appraisal of that would be limited to my own circle of acquaintances.", "thank you so much!

She can do what she wants but acting out of spite when you haven't thought out the consequences is AH behaviour", "I never said that, so dont out words in my mouth. As I said in another reply, it doesn't have to be the mother, it's the whole world she's related to. Was op going to visit the friend's house and some colleagues of the mother visit too, the mother must be a good person, but not everyone in that work environment are and could behave in the wrong way with someone who's underage. It's legitimate, but it doesn't mean it's moral to work that job. Op is 14 and she shouldn't be having anything to do with stripping. \n\nThere could be endless reasons for why he doesn't want her gf to know. Maybe she doesn't like his friends, she doesn't like him going to strip clubs, maybe he had decided to go out with his friends instead of with her and he just doesn't want her knowing. Regardless of this, he is 30+, he can decide to do whatever he wants, and it's not op's role to tell his gf he went there.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that op knew this what job her friend's mother did and lied to her parents. Him lying to his gf doesn't have anything to do with how the parents decide to educate their daughter. \n\nYeah, you're more focused on op's phone breaking, so on how her brother could potentially be dangerous, so if you and op are worried about that she should just tell his gf that he threatened to break her phone if she doesn't follow the rules they've imposed on herm", "I had 1,000 coins left that I told myself I wouldn\u2019t spend until I saw a comment(s) that I just knew it needed to be highlighted, this was that comment.

I think it's only fair that his gf knows.\n\nThis seems like a reactionary statement. \"my brother made me feel bad, it's only fair he has to feel bad\".

Maybe OP is very mature and knows the ins and outs of her brothers relationship, but I'm only going to assume that if OP gives an indication that's true", "You\u2019re twisting her words she actually said there in black and white that she thinks it\u2019s only fair that his GF knows", "You call it spite, I call it justice", "Yeah, she was treated badly, it's only fair that she gets to make things uncomfortable for her brother.

Op is 14. She should not be introduced to the stripper world. It doesn't matter if the mother is good or bad. \nJust think of this situation, op is at her friend's home, and some stripper friends visit while she's there, the mother may also be a normal person thag doesnt bring home her job, but who knows about her colleague. Op's parents are doing what's better for her even tho they may be going overboard. This is not being narrow-minded and judgmental. This is making sure a kid is not introduced to a world where people strip to earn money. And don't come at me saying there's nothing wrong with that.", "\u2705"]}
