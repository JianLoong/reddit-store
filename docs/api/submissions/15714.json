You\u2019re family wants you to cut ties with your friend because her mother is a stripper? But doesn\u2019t care that your brother goes to strip clubs and spends money watching her dance? \n\nIt would be petty to tell the gf but I say do it, he\u2019s threatened to break your phone and is acting like an AH. The gf deserves better.", "That girl deserves to know the family she is marring into, it\u2019s only fair if you do it!", "NTA.\nThe hypocrisy is unreal! Brother goes to strip club, but you can't know the daughter of one of said strippers", "I feel like focusing on if you'd be TA here is shifting away from a larger concern. Your family is obviously highly controlling, trying to isolate you from your support system and weird toward you already, and your brother threatened to break your phone. So, as a formerly abused kid I feel the need to point out that you reaching out to the gf may cause a large escalation in the way your family reacts, and you need to weigh the potential consequences of that against the benefits. Breaking your phone is a violent act. Do you know for sure that he wouldn't get violent with you?Morally you would not be TA here at all imo. But your focus should be on your own safety first", "Go ahead and do it.  You wouldn\u2019t be wrong, but given your family\u2019s despicable behavior I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it backfires.\n\nYWNBTA", "YWNBTA\n\nthe double standards and the misogyny. smh", "Tell the girlfriend", "YWNBTA", "No, you wouldn't be the arsehole. In fact, if you weren't 14, I would say you would be an arsehole for not telling your brother's girlfriend that you went to a strip club, because yes, she deserves to know. However, since you are 14, I would say it's not your place or responsibility to get involved.\n\nStrip clubs are, generally speaking, not nice places. The men who go there are sleazy (hence why I think your brother's girlfriend deserves to know), and the women who work there are often there because something's gone seriously wrong. This isn't always the case, especially if someone is working in a strip club for a short time when they are young, but if your friend's mum is in her 30s or 40s with children, and working in a strip club, then they are likely to have problems with drugs or alcohol and at worst might have problems with pimps or otherwise unsavoury men hanging around and taking advantage. So I think it's understandable that your family might want you to avoid being around your friend's mum, but I don't think it's fair for them to ask you to cut your friend off.\n\nIt sounds like your family blame women for finding themselves in the situation where they need to take their clothes off for money, but don't blame the men who go to the strip clubs and pay money to see those women. It's a pretty disgusting double standard if you ask me. I would just stay out of it if I were you, keep seeing your friend, don't tell your family about it, but do be careful around your friend's mum, especially if you suspect any of the issues I mentioned are at play.\n\nDisclaimer to say not all strippers are in a bad situation and are stripping as a last resort, but realistically this is the case for the majority of women in the sex industry, especially the non-online sex industry.", "Do it.

You're 14, so underage, and they have every right to say you shouldn't be near people who work in strip clubs because they can't know what type of discussions or things could be present at her house. It doesn't mean I agree, but I understand them. \n\nYour brother is 30 and went there for a bachelor party, not because he frequents it regularly. \n\nPlus, the main reason for me is that you just don't interfere with your siblings' love life. I'm sure you'd hate it if he ever did so with your boyfriend. This is not a situation serious enough to possibly ruin his relationship with his gf.

Maybe tell them you won't cut ties with your best friend and them & ur brother better be nice to you, otherwise his GF may get wind of the whole thing.\n\nThis is not a question of you being an AH or not. You're not an adult and basically rely on your parents and family.

The family is way out of line here.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with choosing to be a stripper, and OPs family is not only hypocritical but also a-holes for being fine with her brother going to a strip club while demanding that she drop her best friend simply because their mother works at that club.\n\nNTA OP", "Tell them you\u2019ll consider cutting ties when your brother tells his girlfriend how much he likes to frequent them.", "NTA\n\nHowever, be aware that this might have some serious consequences for you. Considering that your family would rather you cut ties with a friend, but not scold their son, means that their priorities are skewed.\n\n\nAt the same time, breaking your phone if you didn't behave? That is a serious threat and you should take it seriously. If they react like that, they might punish you violently if you say anything.\n\nHis GF needs to know what kind of man she is with and know what the family is really like.

Or he just quietly shuts up and even has to support you to your parents.\n\nKeeping secrets is not a terrible thing you could be saving his relationship and your friendship in one go.

You need to decide if doing the right thing is safe for you though. Your family sound very controlling and potentially dangerous. Do you have other family you could stay with if shit hits the fan? Is helping your brothers girlfriend going to put you in danger? If she dumps him over knowledge you shared with her would he hurt you? Would your parents let him? \n\nI think these are questions you should consider before taking action. Also if you know where your passport and other important documents are I recommend taking pictures of them and sending them to yourself on an email. Email accounts can be accessed from anywhere. If you have money or a possession that holds high emotional value I'd recommend hiding them well. Your family sounds very controlling, keeping yourself safe is top priority.\n\nAlso don't cut off the friend with the stripper mom. Let your family think you've cut her off if necessary. It sounds like they're trying to take away your support system outside of the house. That support system is important to keep.", "You are 14, Reddit isn\u2019t going to give any good advice.

Typically I would say yes, let the GF know however in this case I worry about the repercussions of telling the GF.

Why would OP insult them? She cares about them.", "I think you're mistaken here, though it is likely due to the ambiguous grammar since OP is a child and not the best writer. From the surrounding context, it was the brother who called the mom and friend names, not the OP.", "The brother threatened her and then called the BFF and her mum names, he didn\u2019t threaten her for calling them names - it think?", "Yeah it sounds like he both threatened to break her phone and HE was calling her friend\u2019s mom names.

I think she has the right to decide for herself whether it is worth it or not. There is some value in standing up to abusers. I\u2019m not sure what the alternative is as they will continue this kind of behaviour towards her until she goes NC", "How does the brother know she's op's friend's mother if op is not close to her ? \n\nYeah, they're not constantly stripping everywhere, but a parent can decide that their kid should not come into contact with people who work that job.", "People have different values, and a parent deciding that their 14-year-old daughter shouldn't be having contacts with a person who strips for work is not going overboard.\n\nI never said the family are not hypocritical for their reasons, but op would still be an ah if she told her brother's sister. She would be doing it out of spite only and not because she thinks brother has done something wrong.", "How would you know what she does at home.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a clear cut case as to which is worse in the long term as putting up with abuse long term changes your personality, damages your self esteem and can leave you with severe depression/anxiety. That\u2019s not to mention people who take advantage of your silence. It is a lose-lose situation unfortunately but it\u2019s up to each individual to tread their own path. Poor OP"]}
