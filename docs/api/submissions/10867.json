Most of the time I just deal with this fact and bring a book with me when we're meeting up because I know I'll be waiting at least 20/30 minutes for her to show up. It irritates me, but I'm used to it.\n\nWe booked a holiday together and were due to leave yesterday. It's a train that goes to another country, so you have to get there around 60 minutes before departure time so you can go through security and customs etc. I told her I'd arrive 90 minutes before to give myself a bit of leeway in case there was an issue with the train. She said it was fine, she'd just get there 60 minutes before, as we've taken that train a lot and there's never been an issue. I asked her three/ four times to show up a bit earlier just in case but she just told me to relax.\n\nI'm sure you can guess what happens next. I get to the station in time, and I'm waiting there for her. She then texts me that the train she was meant to get to arrive at the station had been cancelled. The next one was not for another thirty minutes. She says she's going to run to another station 20 minutes walk away and get the tube, but she's not sure when she'll arrive. I say, okay that's fine, I'll go through security and meet you on the other side - just concentrate on getting here.\n\nI go through security and it's manic, like packed. So I messaged her to suggest she get an Uber to get here as soon as possible. She said she'd just get the tube and would probably make it. She got to the station in time, but the queue for security was too long and she missed the train.\n\nI'd already got on the train at this point, so I suggested maybe seeing if she could get another one later, but the price for them was ridiculously high, so she just stayed behind. She's super upset with me now because I'm enjoying the holiday we were meant to be on and she thinks I should've just waited for her, and that I abandoned her. I think it was her own fault, and I warned her several times to be early or risk missing it, and I didn't want to waste the money I spent on the trip.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Sorry for the awful mistake in the title, I can't fix it.", "created_utc": 1677328826, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bk3rm/aita_for_getting_the_train_anyway_when_my_friend/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plenty of trains each day.", "That's a her problem.", "You know what? I also was the one always struggling with being too late, I was always getting super stressed, rushing everywhere, arriving a hot mess. It was giving me so much stress that I now do the following: If I think I will need one hour to get ready, I plan in 2. I get up extra early and if a ride somewhere takes 30 mins, I count 45, plus 10 to find parking. If I go by train or bus, I don't take the one that arrives just on time, I take the one before that.\n\nNow I do get stressed before getting out of the door sometimes, but as I planned in extra time for that and factored in more time for the drive, it always works out. Things never go perfectly, you never hit all green lights when you're in a rush, the bus is never on time when you need it. By planning around an \"if everything goes super smoothly\"-timeline you're bound to fail.\n\nDo I like to get up early? Is it great to be the first to arrive? No, surely not, but I am sure to arrive relaxed, have all my stuff with me, and I am sure not to disrespect any other person by having to worry about me getting there or waiting for me.\n\nChronic lateness is not an incurable disease, it's a flaw that can be worked on, and I now view people who refuse to work on it as people who disrespect my time and the time of others.\n\nSo I am not saying that you are like this, as you said you can make it on time if you try, but I'd advise OP to get more angry with their friend and not let the chronic tardiness slip, but be outraged that the friend doesn't respect them.", "So you can be on time for your own pleasure, but not for other people?", "This is really helpful though I\u2019m currently on the waitlist for being tested for ADHD and Autism and I think it\u2019s lack of treatment has made me worse. That being said these tips sound really helpful. I\u2019ll be sure to try them", "This is what I'm like. Grew up in a family that was always late for everything n its given me such anxiety bout being late. I always get bags ready day before and I have to be ready an hour before I'm due to go out so when time to leave all have to do is grab bag shoes on grab the kid n out the door. Be at the bus stop ten mins before bus is due n like u get the bus before the one I need. Prefer to be 30 mins early and wait than be 10mins late and letting people down.", "I also was diagnosed with ADHD recently, so was my partner, and we realised we really had to work harder to overcome things that others don't even realise exist. He has the tendency to be messy, so he developed a system where everything has its place and he throws everything away as soon as he doesn't need it anymore. I was super confused the first time we got back from somewhere and instead of winding down or drinking something he straight went on to empty his whole bag and stored everything away. He will not delay anything as he knows that he will let things pile up otherwise.\n\nMe on the other hand get stressed easily when I think I have no time anymore, or when something important is ahead. This is why I started this early planning and really forced myself to go against my instincts: I need to buy something for the weekend, and it's Wednesday, so I would have time to buy it until Friday evening, but I force myself to buy it now. It has happened so often that I thought I'd have time, but then I was held up at work and then the shops were closed, or I find out on Friday the thing is out of stock and I have to rush somewhere else...so now I try to be so early that I still have time for unexpected delays.\n\nSo I just want to tell you that yes, a condition like ADHD makes things more difficult, but we still don't have to give up on improving. We have to put in more effort and it takes more energy, but I think we can get the same things done as everyone else!", "They definitely are. It\u2019s the same way I plan things. Sometimes I end up spending 30 minutes reading Reddit in my car \ud83d\ude05 because I\u2019m early, but like the person you responded to, I\u2019m less stressed and don\u2019t forget the things I need when using this system. I do exactly the same as they do. \n\nFor long car rides I plan an extra 30 minutes for every hour of the trip which either allows for food/gas/bathroom and \u201ccheck out that cool place\u201d stops along the way with no stress", "I also have a partner with ADHD, and we struggle with similar things. I really appreciate the advice", "This is refreshing to read! ADD and ADHD are challenging conditions that require developing coping skills! So many treat it as an excuse to not be responsible for their own behavior!  \nChallenges come in infinite forms, character determines success or failure, not your diagnosis."]}
