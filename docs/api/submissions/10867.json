It irritates me, but I'm used to it.\n\nWe booked a holiday together and were due to leave yesterday. It's a train that goes to another country, so you have to get there around 60 minutes before departure time so you can go through security and customs etc. I told her I'd arrive 90 minutes before to give myself a bit of leeway in case there was an issue with the train. She said it was fine, she'd just get there 60 minutes before, as we've taken that train a lot and there's never been an issue. I asked her three/ four times to show up a bit earlier just in case but she just told me to relax.\n\nI'm sure you can guess what happens next. I get to the station in time, and I'm waiting there for her. She then texts me that the train she was meant to get to arrive at the station had been cancelled. The next one was not for another thirty minutes. She says she's going to run to another station 20 minutes walk away and get the tube, but she's not sure when she'll arrive. I say, okay that's fine, I'll go through security and meet you on the other side - just concentrate on getting here.\n\nI go through security and it's manic, like packed. So I messaged her to suggest she get an Uber to get here as soon as possible. She said she'd just get the tube and would probably make it. She got to the station in time, but the queue for security was too long and she missed the train.\n\nI'd already got on the train at this point, so I suggested maybe seeing if she could get another one later, but the price for them was ridiculously high, so she just stayed behind. She's super upset with me now because I'm enjoying the holiday we were meant to be on and she thinks I should've just waited for her, and that I abandoned her.

I also was the one always struggling with being too late, I was always getting super stressed, rushing everywhere, arriving a hot mess. It was giving me so much stress that I now do the following: If I think I will need one hour to get ready, I plan in 2. I get up extra early and if a ride somewhere takes 30 mins, I count 45, plus 10 to find parking. If I go by train or bus, I don't take the one that arrives just on time, I take the one before that.\n\nNow I do get stressed before getting out of the door sometimes, but as I planned in extra time for that and factored in more time for the drive, it always works out. Things never go perfectly, you never hit all green lights when you're in a rush, the bus is never on time when you need it. By planning around an \"if everything goes super smoothly\"-timeline you're bound to fail.\n\nDo I like to get up early? Is it great to be the first to arrive? No, surely not, but I am sure to arrive relaxed, have all my stuff with me, and I am sure not to disrespect any other person by having to worry about me getting there or waiting for me.\n\nChronic lateness is not an incurable disease, it's a flaw that can be worked on, and I now view people who refuse to work on it as people who disrespect my time and the time of others.\n\nSo I am not saying that you are like this, as you said you can make it on time if you try, but I'd advise OP to get more angry with their friend and not let the chronic tardiness slip, but be outraged that the friend doesn't respect them.", "So you can be on time for your own pleasure, but not for other people?", "This is really helpful though I\u2019m currently on the waitlist for being tested for ADHD and Autism and I think it\u2019s lack of treatment has made me worse.

He has the tendency to be messy, so he developed a system where everything has its place and he throws everything away as soon as he doesn't need it anymore. I was super confused the first time we got back from somewhere and instead of winding down or drinking something he straight went on to empty his whole bag and stored everything away. He will not delay anything as he knows that he will let things pile up otherwise.\n\nMe on the other hand get stressed easily when I think I have no time anymore, or when something important is ahead. This is why I started this early planning and really forced myself to go against my instincts: I need to buy something for the weekend, and it's Wednesday, so I would have time to buy it until Friday evening, but I force myself to buy it now. It has happened so often that I thought I'd have time, but then I was held up at work and then the shops were closed, or I find out on Friday the thing is out of stock and I have to rush somewhere else...so now I try to be so early that I still have time for unexpected delays.\n\nSo I just want to tell you that yes, a condition like ADHD makes things more difficult, but we still don't have to give up on improving.

People can have time management issues for a whole host of reasons...  she may just not care about other people's time, or she might have ADHD and has never suffered enough consequences to do the massive work required to get herself to start being on time.\n\nFor someone with ADHD, being on time takes way more thought and effort than someone else.  We have to fight our brains to be on time.  I used to be late quite a bit.  I hated it, and it made me anxious, and I tried not to be, but I was a good worker, so my boss just excused it, and because ADHD has a strong genetic link, most of my family had similar issues, so I didn't get any negative, external consequences from them...\n\nit wasn't until I met my husband and he could NOT handle my being late, that I had to completely re-arrange and restructure both how I thought about my time and scheduling, as well as physically restructuring my house, so that I wouldn't be late as often.

It sounds ridiculous, because I am otherwise I reasonably intelligent person...  but having to find a pair of shoes, instead of just having my one pair that matches everything, sitting by the door, can completely unravel a morning, for months.\n\nAnd it takes time and effort for an ADHD person to figure out what works for them, and if nothing in their life forces them to be on time, the work doesn't get done.\n\nAll that said, OP is NTA.  If her friend has ADHD, that doesn't change the fact she was late, and there's no reason OP should miss the vacation because her friend was struggling...  the only reason I explained all that is because it isn't necessarily an intentional act of disrespect towards OP.  OP should know it MIGHT be disrespect, but it also might be that her friend really wanted to be on time, but just couldn't, and is too disappointed to see through that right now.\n\nIf it is ADHD, or a similar trauma-caused executive dysfunction issue, that means her friend would benefit from more consequences, not less, so OP should not make excuses for her friend, she should just understand that it's not about her, it's not an intentional insult, it's her friend's issue and OP should try not to take it personally.", "I recently looked up the costs, and YIKES.

I figured out how long it takes me to do certain things. For example, figuring out what to wear can take up to 15 minutes if I'm really indecisive.

It does take time and effort to learn. You have to make the time to learn. You have to look at yourself and consider what you have the most difficulty with and find ways to work around it.\n\nI don't agree with the second part.

We knocked on the door and T\u2019s daughter answered and said T was in the shower. I told her daughter to let her know we\u2019d see her there and we\u2019d tell to save her a seat near us. I felt awful but there was no way I was prepared to be late to the funeral. If people are late, they will sometimes miss out. It doesn\u2019t mean other people have to", " NTA. Your friend is an adult and needs to learn time management. The fact that she regularly does this and makes you wait all of the time is disrespectful. Next time she makes you wait, continue to leave, your time is important also.", "NTA\n\nSo basically your friend expected you to pay the price of her mistake with her.", "NTA, they would have left earlier is they actually cared. i really dont care what anyone thinks on this one. if you are a perpetually late kinda person, im not going to wait on you. my dad was like this. he wouldnt get ready to go somewhere until we were all in the car at the time we needed to leave to get there on time. my aunt was ALSO worse. she wouldnt get ready (1 hour long or more) to go somewhere UNTIL it was time to go. everyone ended up telling her the event was 1 hour earlier just so shed get there at a reasonable 30 mins late.", "NTA. I had a friend like this as well. Emphasis on *HAD*. It drove me insane that she was late for everything, and what was worse was that she didn't seem to care at all that she was making people wait for her. At first she'd come up with excuses for why, but eventually, she'd just show up late and have no excuse at all. She had absolutely no respect for anyone, or anyone's time, and neither does your friend. She values her time more than yours and thinks her time is more important. It isn't.", "NTA these are called Consequences, they happen when people fail to learn from their mistakes.  Your friend is an asshole for expecting you to have effectively just burned your cash for her inability to manage to act like an adult.  Hell how does she have money for a vacation if she's Never on time.  Presumably her job has a schedule they expect her to hold to.", "NTA\n\nI have a friend of 30 plus years. Early on, I discovered that she was one of those chronically late people. One day we were meeting at a mall. We didn\u2019t have cell phones back then. I sat on a bench for almost an hour. I didn\u2019t want to get up to shop or walk around because if she showed up we\u2019d miss each other. Finally, just as I was getting ready to go, she ran in, spouting a list of bullshit excuses. I knew they were bullshit because she\u2019d used them before other times she was late and it was less annoying because I wasn\u2019t sitting there by myself.\n\nI told her that she clearly didn\u2019t have any respect for my time, and if it happened again, I would give her fifteen minutes, then leave. I don\u2019t feel bad about it because I\u2019m NTA, she\u2019s the one wasting my time and I\u2019m the victim. It can be annoying to have to do this with an adult.\n\nOver the years, we\u2019re still friends, but I give her clear time constraints. Beginning and ending times, and she knows I\u2019m not kidding. She showed up to my house for a 1-4 PM hangout at 3:45. At 4:00 I told her I had stuff to do and it was time for her to go. She\u2019s a fun friend, but I manage my expectations and take care of myself.", "NTA. Your friend is an adult and should learn time managment so she can fix this issue by now. I hope you enjoyed your little holiday.", "So you should miss your holiday because she's late? Nah. She's pissed at herself and taking it out on you. She'll calm down. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.  My wife has a friend like that and I just set a policy that if she is late we will not wait for her as she is not respecting our time so we don't need to respect her time.  She broke the social contract and cannot claim protection under it.", "YTA , for not lying to her about the train times\u2026 I have that same friend I just lie that we need one train earlier so we are always on time she knows I do this , she knows she needs it.

I would also carry this forward and stop waiting for her in the future also.", "NTA - I am a chronically late friend. (My friends understand and we generally don't even set a time for arrival any more). But when it's an important set start time I will aim to be there early in ratio to the importance of the activity. So for a theatre show I'd aim to arrive 30mins early, for the situation you described I would aim to be there at least 2 hours early if not half a day early and look around the area local to the station. Or I would make arrangements to meet my friend beforehand and travel with them.\nIt's called coping mechanisms and they don't have any, that's on them.\nIt's really selfish for them to want you to have missed out because they can't make it on time. Especially when you advised them in the first place.", "NTA\n\nHer poor planning shouldn't ruin your holiday too. She should have realised that your patience with her had limits. You're only human. She sounds thoughtless. You're not in the wrong here, you planned ahead properly, so enjoy your break!", "NTA - I had a friend who was always minimum 30 mins late and it was incredibly frustrating and made me hesitant about planning things with them.\n\nI have ADHD and I am rarely late because I purposely overestimate the time I need for any task, to get ready or to get anywhere. And I set myself multiple alarms and reminders.\n\nI really do not understand how it is so difficult for people to be on time (excluding one-off unexpected incidents).", "Had a friend like that.\n\nWe got into an argument once over it because we were supposed to meet some other people we didn't know and making other people wait pissed me off. Told him it was a question of respecting other people.\n\nWanna know what his best argument for always being late was? It's not murder, calm down.", "No one is the asshole here. She can't organise herself so she was late, and you were on time so you went on holidays.", "NTA\n\nShe fucked around and found out basically. \n\nPlanning to arrive at a station with the bare minimum of time is poor planning.\n\nHer expecting YOU to lose out on your vacation because SHE failed to plan is ridiculous. Unless she felt like paying you every cent you would be losing, there is absolutely zero incentive for you to miss out. \n\nYou paid. You planned properly. Enjoy your vacation!\n\nMaybe she will have learned something. Probably not. But maybe.", "NTA - as a chronically late person who enjoys travelling, this is where you are supposed to tell yourself the wrong time so that you make it there on time. If I was going to be late, it is 100% my fault and I would tell my friend to go without me and try to make it up to them when they got back. Being late is also why I like to travel solo\u2026no one to rely on my crappy brain but me \ud83d\ude05 Enjoy your trip!", "NTA. She is beyond rude for her chronic lateness. Not your problem.", "NTA, but your friend is.", "NTA. Hope you have all the fun without the guilt. Friend needs to take accountability here and get some help. I have time blindness and prior to knowing that, I would be late A LOT and it meant I just missed out, paid the Late Tax. It was beyond frustrating for me and others. Now that I know, I do lightyears better with time. Maybe your friend has the same issue and once she learns time blindness management skills, you can enjoy trips together.", "NTA.  I had a friend who was always late like that and missed a couple of events because of it.  She chose to not be a little early, she chose not to take an uber to the station and instead took the tube.  It is not your fault at all that you planned to be early \"just in case\" and that you are now enjoying the trip.\n\nShame on her for guilting you like this.  Enjoy your trip.", "gosh, so clearly NTA. Your friend should be comprehensive! You were looking forward to this holiday too. She can't take that away from you. And also she can't expect you to just forget about the cost, for her?! A friend can have their flaws but when they pull you into their mess, or expect you to happily jump into it, that is a red flag to me.", "Nta. I feel worse for you because now you have to go on vacation alone.", "I've been burned by security enough times to remind myself to give that leeway. She should have taken a car once she heard security was tight. I wouldn't be mad at my friend if she went anyways. It would be my fault.

Why don't you say 'she'?", "One of my best friends is chronically, reliably late. Last time we flew together she was through security within 10 minutes of me!

That's why, when I know I have time-sensitive plans, I specifically plan to be *at least* half an hour early for whatever it is I need to do. If the plans involved someone else and they directly asked me to be early, there's no way I would refuse because as an adult I'm responsible for my own time management *even though I have ADHD that makes it difficult.* It's my responsibility, not my friends' responsibility. ADHD is a reason that I have difficulties, it's not an excuse for me to put in zero effort to compensate for those difficulties.\n\n\nEven ignoring all that, the fact that the friend wanted OP to miss the holiday because the friend missed the train *due to her own refusal to plan ahead* is ridiculously childish and selfish. I can't imagine being mad at my friends for not giving up their own plans to accommodate me, *especially* if it was entirely my fault that the plans didn't work out for me.
