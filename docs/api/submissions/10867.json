It irritates me, but I'm used to it.\n\nWe booked a holiday together and were due to leave yesterday. It's a train that goes to another country, so you have to get there around 60 minutes before departure time so you can go through security and customs etc. I told her I'd arrive 90 minutes before to give myself a bit of leeway in case there was an issue with the train. She said it was fine, she'd just get there 60 minutes before, as we've taken that train a lot and there's never been an issue. I asked her three/ four times to show up a bit earlier just in case but she just told me to relax.\n\nI'm sure you can guess what happens next. I get to the station in time, and I'm waiting there for her. She then texts me that the train she was meant to get to arrive at the station had been cancelled. The next one was not for another thirty minutes. She says she's going to run to another station 20 minutes walk away and get the tube, but she's not sure when she'll arrive. I say, okay that's fine, I'll go through security and meet you on the other side - just concentrate on getting here.\n\nI go through security and it's manic, like packed. So I messaged her to suggest she get an Uber to get here as soon as possible. She said she'd just get the tube and would probably make it. She got to the station in time, but the queue for security was too long and she missed the train.\n\nI'd already got on the train at this point, so I suggested maybe seeing if she could get another one later, but the price for them was ridiculously high, so she just stayed behind. She's super upset with me now because I'm enjoying the holiday we were meant to be on and she thinks I should've just waited for her, and that I abandoned her.

I also was the one always struggling with being too late, I was always getting super stressed, rushing everywhere, arriving a hot mess. It was giving me so much stress that I now do the following: If I think I will need one hour to get ready, I plan in 2. I get up extra early and if a ride somewhere takes 30 mins, I count 45, plus 10 to find parking. If I go by train or bus, I don't take the one that arrives just on time, I take the one before that.\n\nNow I do get stressed before getting out of the door sometimes, but as I planned in extra time for that and factored in more time for the drive, it always works out. Things never go perfectly, you never hit all green lights when you're in a rush, the bus is never on time when you need it. By planning around an \"if everything goes super smoothly\"-timeline you're bound to fail.\n\nDo I like to get up early? Is it great to be the first to arrive? No, surely not, but I am sure to arrive relaxed, have all my stuff with me, and I am sure not to disrespect any other person by having to worry about me getting there or waiting for me.\n\nChronic lateness is not an incurable disease, it's a flaw that can be worked on, and I now view people who refuse to work on it as people who disrespect my time and the time of others.\n\nSo I am not saying that you are like this, as you said you can make it on time if you try, but I'd advise OP to get more angry with their friend and not let the chronic tardiness slip, but be outraged that the friend doesn't respect them.", "So you can be on time for your own pleasure, but not for other people?", "This is really helpful though I\u2019m currently on the waitlist for being tested for ADHD and Autism and I think it\u2019s lack of treatment has made me worse.

He has the tendency to be messy, so he developed a system where everything has its place and he throws everything away as soon as he doesn't need it anymore. I was super confused the first time we got back from somewhere and instead of winding down or drinking something he straight went on to empty his whole bag and stored everything away. He will not delay anything as he knows that he will let things pile up otherwise.\n\nMe on the other hand get stressed easily when I think I have no time anymore, or when something important is ahead. This is why I started this early planning and really forced myself to go against my instincts: I need to buy something for the weekend, and it's Wednesday, so I would have time to buy it until Friday evening, but I force myself to buy it now. It has happened so often that I thought I'd have time, but then I was held up at work and then the shops were closed, or I find out on Friday the thing is out of stock and I have to rush somewhere else...so now I try to be so early that I still have time for unexpected delays.\n\nSo I just want to tell you that yes, a condition like ADHD makes things more difficult, but we still don't have to give up on improving.

People can have time management issues for a whole host of reasons...  she may just not care about other people's time, or she might have ADHD and has never suffered enough consequences to do the massive work required to get herself to start being on time.\n\nFor someone with ADHD, being on time takes way more thought and effort than someone else.  We have to fight our brains to be on time.  I used to be late quite a bit.  I hated it, and it made me anxious, and I tried not to be, but I was a good worker, so my boss just excused it, and because ADHD has a strong genetic link, most of my family had similar issues, so I didn't get any negative, external consequences from them...\n\nit wasn't until I met my husband and he could NOT handle my being late, that I had to completely re-arrange and restructure both how I thought about my time and scheduling, as well as physically restructuring my house, so that I wouldn't be late as often.

It sounds ridiculous, because I am otherwise I reasonably intelligent person...  but having to find a pair of shoes, instead of just having my one pair that matches everything, sitting by the door, can completely unravel a morning, for months.\n\nAnd it takes time and effort for an ADHD person to figure out what works for them, and if nothing in their life forces them to be on time, the work doesn't get done.\n\nAll that said, OP is NTA.  If her friend has ADHD, that doesn't change the fact she was late, and there's no reason OP should miss the vacation because her friend was struggling...  the only reason I explained all that is because it isn't necessarily an intentional act of disrespect towards OP.  OP should know it MIGHT be disrespect, but it also might be that her friend really wanted to be on time, but just couldn't, and is too disappointed to see through that right now.\n\nIf it is ADHD, or a similar trauma-caused executive dysfunction issue, that means her friend would benefit from more consequences, not less, so OP should not make excuses for her friend, she should just understand that it's not about her, it's not an intentional insult, it's her friend's issue and OP should try not to take it personally.", "I recently looked up the costs, and YIKES.

We have to fight our brains to be on time. I used to be late quite a bit. I hated it, and it made me anxious, and I tried not to be\n\nI'm the same way. I'm time-blind, and sometimes I get overwhelmed when there's a lot to do to get ready. You have to adapt and learn what to do to make sure that you're not late, at least for the most part.\n\nI've learned to wake up or start getting ready early enough so that even if I sleep in or have difficulties, I'll still make it. I figured out how long it takes me to do certain things. For example, figuring out what to wear can take up to 15 minutes if I'm really indecisive. I even make a list the night before if there's any possibility that I'll forget. My biggest difficulty is showering because it takes time and is heavily affected by my time-blindness. \n\n>I didn't get any negative, external consequences from them...\n\n>it wasn't until I met my husband and he could NOT handle my being late\n\nOnly caring and working on yourself when it personally affects *you* isn't an ADHD thing.

If things don't go as planned, it can stress me out a lot and make it more difficult to keep moving and be ready on time.\n\n>And it takes time and effort for an ADHD person to figure out what works for them, and if nothing in their life forces them to be on time, the work doesn't get done.\n\nI agree with the first part. It does take time and effort to learn. You have to make the time to learn. You have to look at yourself and consider what you have the most difficulty with and find ways to work around it.\n\nI don't agree with the second part.
