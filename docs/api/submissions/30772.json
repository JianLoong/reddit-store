If leaving the kids with Chris requires your permission under the agreement (which it must or your story/question would make no sense), all she had to do was ask, and she didn't - knowingly, intentionally - and you are right that tolerating willful violations of the agreement will just encourage her to violate it further.  \n\nNow, if the kids are expecting a trip to Dave & Buster's and you don't take them, you will absolutely end up looking to them like the bad guy here because they had some fun planned, so I suggest you go.

I wouldn't assume OP is unconcerned about his kids' well being here either, I don't think that's a fair posture to start from - if the stepdad wants to take them to Disneyland on what, under their custody agreement, is OP's time, which it is here, is OP supposed to just yield all his time to the stepdad?  I don't think so, this isn't at all about OP failing to care for or do right by his kids, which we have zero evidence of IMHO, but about whether he is obligated to allow his ex and her husband to violate the agreement - I don't think he is and I don't think he's an AH for not giving up what under the agreement is his time with them.", "It didn't take long for you to make my life about you.", "Here's why he's probably saying \"sneaky\": she knew perfectly well she promised to honor an agreement in which, in this situation, she would have to call OP before making these plans because if she's away, it's technically a 'sitter' situation. She also wanted Chris take the kids to D&B to bond with them more, but she guessed that OP would probably say \"no, let me do it instead\". So she didn't tell him. Hence, *sneaky*. \n\nI'd say it comes down to whether that kind of shit is something she pulls all the time (and perhaps why they divorced). There are people whom if given an inch in one direction, will take a light year. You have to be rigid with someone like that even if it makes you look like an asshole because otherwise they will walk all over you. \n\nBut he's still overlooking the big picture: happiness of the kids. Having a good relationship with their step dad is a part of that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Had you run it by me then I would had been okay. \n\nSounds to me like you don't want there to be any parental relationship between kids and stepdad, and I'm not sure I believe that statement one bit. That sounds like the same disclaimer I see in *every* AITA in which my answer is YTA.\n\nA step parent IS a parent, so I'm not sure why this 'right of first refusal' should even exist once remarriage happens. He's not a sitter. He is legally a parent.\n\nYTA", "Because that's what we agreed to", "That's all fair, but I think we'll have to agree to disagree on whether he's an AH or not based on our respective interpretations of the wordings of his post and replies in the comments. That's where I get the idea that the most important thing to him is putting his foot down, not whether the kids will enjoy the outing or not. I don't think I've seen once where OP says anyone has asked the kids what they'd like to do, and imo that matters. Nor have I seen OP say anything about caring about what they'd like to do, everything I've read seems all to be about a power struggle between OP and his ex and her husband, with their kids as the \"prize\" so to speak. He's even admitted openly that he doesn't want to go, and that this plan would have been 100% fine if he'd been asked beforehand, but that he feels he has to put his foot down. But who does that help? No one, really, and from my point of view it short changes the kids, and potentially their relationship with their stepfather who while he may not be their bio, appears to care about the kids and be trying, even from OP's perspective. \n\nIt's apparently not a recurring issue or a pattern, so for this first time occurrence a simple \"hey, I don't appreciate not being apprised of this beforehand, I know the kids will enjoy this so I won't do anything to make them unhappy, but in the future this sort of stuff needs to be discussed and our custody agreement needs to be followed\" or something to that effect would be more than sufficient. And if time with his kids and their happiness was what's firstly important, he could just request an extra week with them in return for a time when there isn't already something fun planned for them that they're looking forward to, and that would almost certainly be granted. \n\nIf it's handled poorly, this also has the potential to compromise relationships with friends for the children, and/or to compromise the trust of their friend's parents. I can certainly imagine a scenario where their friends' parents may know and trust Chris but don't know OP very well if at all, and thus won't allow their kids to go on this new trip to Dave and Buster's with an unfamiliar adult. Or perhaps, after the trip goes poorly because OP is grumpy and self-admittedly doesn't want to go, never be allowed to play with them again, etc.\n\nI just don't think OP has his childrens' happiness and relationships first or even second in his priorities when forcing this situation to this resolution, especially when it's not even something he wants to do himself. He's only in this position because he's backed himself into a corner.", "Lmao. Sorry I know an asshole dad when I see one. Enjoy your power trip.", "I feel like yes maybe she does maybe pull that shit but is she pulling that shit for the happiness of her kids ? If she thought it mattered and she was being sneaky surely she wouldn't have told him in the first place , the kids where in her care for a while so he wouldn't have known , therefore I don't think she was being sneaky because she was honest . He'd never have known . \n\nI also feel she knows daddy does f all with the kids and step dad does fun stuff they love. Which makes me think that even if she was trying to be sneaky it was for their benefit whereas he's just acting jealous and only caring about his thoughts not the kids .", "No, you're agreement was about getting a sitter. He's not a sitter, he's their step father. YTA", "To answer the question- no, NTA for making the SD cry. Because he chose to cry. That said, the fact you called her to go over the schedule to then learn of her going out of town for the weekend means she needs someone to watch the kids on her time (depending on the state) because they can\u2019t be left alone.\n\nIf she was going on her work trip and took the kids with her and the SD, and they weren\u2019t in her care for 8hrs/day, the ROFR would still be violated.\n\nI get it, a step parent is not the parent in the court documents and as a sibling of a child with parents split with ROFR, it would be petty to have to ask the other parent if on my parents time I can have time with my sibling. But step parents are NOT suddenly granted rights because they married the ex either. The kids in this case are being left with the SD for more than just a day, one of which the SD made \u201csurprise plans\u201d to take the kids to Dave & Busters.\n\nWe do not have enough information to know the motivations behind SD taking the kids to D&B with friends he bought underwear and clothes for\u2026 from Old Navy (oddly specific) or the relationship the 7m and 10m have with this new SD. Additionally, this doesn\u2019t address an unknown (or not very well known - non-blood family member only the wife knows) being the care taker of 2 boys.\n\nAnd based on the short - matter of fact responses - the OP may be being Petty and sounding like an AH, but maybe he\u2019d rather plan -his ROFR time- doing something else with his boys and D&B is not really a \u201cbonding\u201d activity if other kids are involved.\n\nI feel more information is needed like answers to others question\u2019s would better confirm if the OP is a general AH or just putting his foot down to prevent future parental time opportunity abuses.\n\nLet\u2019s point out that multiple days will be without the bio mom\u2026 so one day may not have been a big deal but the SD is also going to be at D&B alone with at least 4 kids\u2026. There is so much wrong with this scenario and I would not be comfortable with it as a parent myself. Plenty from the sub for petty revenge would likely approve.\n\nKids fun is not being sabotaged because it is supposedly suppose to be a surprise for the boys and friends.

Assuming OP is correct that RoFR considers Stepdad as childcare (which based on others' comments seems reasonable), the whole point of the custody agreement is that it's an agreement.  Ex is trying to emotionally manipulate OP into accepting her failure to comply, which honestly is not OK.  I've seen a lot with shared custody that when you give an inch they take a mile, so it's way easier to stick to the agreement; otherwise, everything becomes a logistical nightmare.  The whole point of the original (binding) agreement is to avoid this and it seems crazy that OP is being criticized for wanting to maintain the agreement/boundaries.\n\nI also want to push back on the idea in the comments that Stepdad is a good (step)parent just because he's taking the kids to Dave & Buster's, and that Sons' going to Dave & Buster's is some inherently amazing thing or some great or magnanimous act of parenting.  Yes, it's fun and a net good thing that Stepdad wants to engage Sons and friends, but--and this is a hugely unpopular to say on the Internet and Reddit--it's weird that people are jumping to the conclusion that Stepdad is a better parent than OP because he wants to go have fun with the kids.  That's not the hard part of parenting.  It's often the case in split custody--and I realize this sounds cynical--one parent is the fun parent that the kids like, but the other parent is actually doing the real hard work raising the children, making difficult decisions and making the sacrifices.  (Think of the younger, permissive second wife that has the kids on the occasional weekend but becomes \"Fun Mommy.\")\n\nI'm not saying that Stepdad is a bad guy--I hope for the Sons that all parties here good, well-meaning people (and this seems like a pretty benign custody dispute).  But it's not hard to see circumstances that would make it completely reasonable for OP not want to concede this in good faith, and we simply don't know enough of the background, like the relationship between OP and Ex (e.g., is she prone to \"taking a mile\"?) for people to be coming down so hard on OP and with as much certainty as they are.\n\nYes, it sucks that Stepdad and Sons don't get to go to Dave & Buster's, and hopefully this not about OP's relationship with Stepdad (and it honestly doesn't sound to me like it is), but that's Ex's problem to solve, not OP's, and I think she needs to be honest with everyone rather than throw OP under the bus with the children to avoid owning up to her mistake).  And the way she's trying to manipulate OP--because ultimately it sounds like she knew that OP had the rights to the kids--sounds like it could be parental estrangement.  It certainly suggests she's has her own shortcomings.\n\nThis seems like a situation that most of us don't know enough about to come down so hard one way or the other unless we're reading our own relationships with our parents and stepparents into it.", "YTA.

I did find a Utah law firm's [explanation](https://www.brownfamilylaw.com/15817/does-the-right-of-first-refusal-apply-to-stepparents/) of right of first refusal.  From the link, text below, it appears, it has to be specifically written into the agreement that the stepparent is parental care and not surrogate care.  Otherwise they are considered surrogate care.  My guess is if the agreement wasn't the way OP is stating it is, his ex and her husband wouldn't have back down.  So yes, I'm inferring.

If it turned out I misunderstood the situation, I'd reconsider my judgment.\n\n>Most of the time in divorce decrees when there\u2019s right of first refusal language, you have what\u2019s called parental care, which means that you have to provide direct care to your child, or give your ex the opportunity to provide direct care to the child, instead of leaving the child with a third party or surrogate care.  \n>  \n>***Usually surrogate care is a mom or a sister or a daycare.***  \n>  \n>***But the question becomes this: is surrogate care stepparent care as well?***  \n>  \n>***This seems like an odd question. We usually think of stepparents as parents, but that\u2019s really not the case in the law when it comes to the right of first refusal.***  \n>  \n>Here in Utah what we\u2019ve found is that you need to write in the right of first refusal language that stepparents are not surrogate care; that they\u2019re parental care.\n\nThis [site](https://mensdivorce.com/right-to-first-refusal/#:~:text=If%20the%20parent%20is%20in,stated%20in%20their%20custody%20agreement) is more from a men's rights in child custody perspective. Here's an explanation from that link:\n\n>Individuals outside of the custody agreement can often cause discord within the co-parenting relationship and challenge aspects of the right of first refusal. In some instances, stepparents of the children or significant others\u2019 of the parents can get involved and cause problems with the right of first refusal.\n\nAnd:\n\n>The right to first refusal is an act to promote co-parenting and foster parenting time for the noncustodial parent. It\u2019s bad enough that a parent does not get to live with their children, but to fight against details within the custody agreement that promote the noncustodial parent\u2019s relationship with their children is to dismiss your children\u2019s feelings toward their parent.\n\nAnother [link](https://stepmomming.com/right-of-first-refusal/) from a stepmom's perspective, discussing the pros and cons of such agreements.   \nIt sounds like ex and her husband made the plans with the kids without checking with OP first as they're supposed to do because of the agreement between the ex and OP.  That's not really fair to the OP or the kids either.  It's pretty much entirely ex and husband's fault the kids are being hurt by this.  Clear it with OP first before telling the kids.  Maybe it was a true oversight and they forgot they had to clear it with OP before tellign the kids.  Or maybe it's a form of parental alienation.

A parent who leaves a child with a new spouse while he goes to his softball game for 2 hours could end up in contempt of court unless the parenting plan is specific and distinct.  Therefore, some judges have moved away from granting the right of first refusal.\n\nhttps://www.lawyerforfamilies.com/right-of-first-refusal/", "i think it\u2019s obvious because if wife could designate him as not childcare, she would?", "His ex wasn't an asshole, sure she's treating the stepdad like a parent bc the kids are as well. The dad doesn't even want to do the shit the kids want to...", "Refusing to let the stepfather take them to Dave and buster because he was mad at his ex, admitting he didn't even want to go, refusing to let step even go with him. \nOp says if she ran it by him first he would have been fine with it so he's taking something fun away from his kids and their stepfather because he's upset with his ex.", "As I said, it is more likely a new user posting error on my part. I'm learning. \n\nThank you for your comment and kindness.  Have an amazing weekend.", "Call it what you will. He's setting boundaries and sticking to them.", "This ruling is so... bizarre to me. It makes plenty of sense if we're talking about actual babysitters, but it just doesn't make any sense to me when it's someone living with the kid...", "Family disputes often don't work like that.  The designation usually follows a legal dispute over an ex doing something like in this post.  And judges do sometimes notice when one parent is pulling what they consider petty or retaliatory stuff.  \"I refused to let my kids stepdad take them to dave and busters with their friends so I could do nothing with them\" isnt a great look", "He doesn't want to go but he's taking them because the kids want to go. He's putting the kids ahead of himself. That makes him a good parent.", "She broke their legal agreement regarding time division.  Now he's locked into someone else's plan he doesn't lime.  How can you turn this around on him?\n\nMaybe he'd just rather have taken them to the skating rink, or on an out of town vacation?   That doesn't make him an asshole.", "There's nothing wrong with not wanting to do a thing the kids want to do. He's still doing it.", "Speaking from experience\u2026 this is how you alienate your kids. \n\nIt works out great for the other parent in the end though.", "Sure...not that someone could take them and they Actually have a good time. Pettiness that's all it is.", "This guy doesn't have a job? Also you act like he can take the fucking kids over her \"breaking the agreement\" lol. Here in a few yeara I'll bet the kids stop forcing themselves from having to make these kinds of bullshit deals bc they will have at least the autonomy to say \"nah I'mma go home\"", "I'd say depends on the family and how good of a time the kids have. Let's not bring in personal experiences and judge on the merits of the info we're given."]}
