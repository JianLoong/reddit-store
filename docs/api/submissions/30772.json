If leaving the kids with Chris requires your permission under the agreement (which it must or your story/question would make no sense), all she had to do was ask, and she didn't - knowingly, intentionally - and you are right that tolerating willful violations of the agreement will just encourage her to violate it further.  \n\nNow, if the kids are expecting a trip to Dave & Buster's and you don't take them, you will absolutely end up looking to them like the bad guy here because they had some fun planned, so I suggest you go.

I wouldn't assume OP is unconcerned about his kids' well being here either, I don't think that's a fair posture to start from - if the stepdad wants to take them to Disneyland on what, under their custody agreement, is OP's time, which it is here, is OP supposed to just yield all his time to the stepdad?  I don't think so, this isn't at all about OP failing to care for or do right by his kids, which we have zero evidence of IMHO, but about whether he is obligated to allow his ex and her husband to violate the agreement - I don't think he is and I don't think he's an AH for not giving up what under the agreement is his time with them.", "It didn't take long for you to make my life about you.", "Here's why he's probably saying \"sneaky\": she knew perfectly well she promised to honor an agreement in which, in this situation, she would have to call OP before making these plans because if she's away, it's technically a 'sitter' situation. She also wanted Chris take the kids to D&B to bond with them more, but she guessed that OP would probably say \"no, let me do it instead\". So she didn't tell him. Hence, *sneaky*. \n\nI'd say it comes down to whether that kind of shit is something she pulls all the time (and perhaps why they divorced). There are people whom if given an inch in one direction, will take a light year. You have to be rigid with someone like that even if it makes you look like an asshole because otherwise they will walk all over you. \n\nBut he's still overlooking the big picture: happiness of the kids. Having a good relationship with their step dad is a part of that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Had you run it by me then I would had been okay. \n\nSounds to me like you don't want there to be any parental relationship between kids and stepdad, and I'm not sure I believe that statement one bit. That sounds like the same disclaimer I see in *every* AITA in which my answer is YTA.\n\nA step parent IS a parent, so I'm not sure why this 'right of first refusal' should even exist once remarriage happens. He's not a sitter. He is legally a parent.\n\nYTA", "Because that's what we agreed to", "That's all fair, but I think we'll have to agree to disagree on whether he's an AH or not based on our respective interpretations of the wordings of his post and replies in the comments. That's where I get the idea that the most important thing to him is putting his foot down, not whether the kids will enjoy the outing or not. I don't think I've seen once where OP says anyone has asked the kids what they'd like to do, and imo that matters. Nor have I seen OP say anything about caring about what they'd like to do, everything I've read seems all to be about a power struggle between OP and his ex and her husband, with their kids as the \"prize\" so to speak. He's even admitted openly that he doesn't want to go, and that this plan would have been 100% fine if he'd been asked beforehand, but that he feels he has to put his foot down. But who does that help? No one, really, and from my point of view it short changes the kids, and potentially their relationship with their stepfather who while he may not be their bio, appears to care about the kids and be trying, even from OP's perspective. \n\nIt's apparently not a recurring issue or a pattern, so for this first time occurrence a simple \"hey, I don't appreciate not being apprised of this beforehand, I know the kids will enjoy this so I won't do anything to make them unhappy, but in the future this sort of stuff needs to be discussed and our custody agreement needs to be followed\" or something to that effect would be more than sufficient. And if time with his kids and their happiness was what's firstly important, he could just request an extra week with them in return for a time when there isn't already something fun planned for them that they're looking forward to, and that would almost certainly be granted. \n\nIf it's handled poorly, this also has the potential to compromise relationships with friends for the children, and/or to compromise the trust of their friend's parents. I can certainly imagine a scenario where their friends' parents may know and trust Chris but don't know OP very well if at all, and thus won't allow their kids to go on this new trip to Dave and Buster's with an unfamiliar adult. Or perhaps, after the trip goes poorly because OP is grumpy and self-admittedly doesn't want to go, never be allowed to play with them again, etc.\n\nI just don't think OP has his childrens' happiness and relationships first or even second in his priorities when forcing this situation to this resolution, especially when it's not even something he wants to do himself. He's only in this position because he's backed himself into a corner.", "Lmao. Sorry I know an asshole dad when I see one. Enjoy your power trip.", "I feel like yes maybe she does maybe pull that shit but is she pulling that shit for the happiness of her kids ? If she thought it mattered and she was being sneaky surely she wouldn't have told him in the first place , the kids where in her care for a while so he wouldn't have known , therefore I don't think she was being sneaky because she was honest . He'd never have known . \n\nI also feel she knows daddy does f all with the kids and step dad does fun stuff they love. Which makes me think that even if she was trying to be sneaky it was for their benefit whereas he's just acting jealous and only caring about his thoughts not the kids .", "No, you're agreement was about getting a sitter. He's not a sitter, he's their step father. YTA"]}
