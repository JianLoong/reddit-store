{"id": 10448, "submission_id": "1176v5l", "title": "AITA for giving away my daughters pet lizards to a shelter", "selftext": "My daughter (16f) has two pet lizards. She\u2019s had them for about two years. They\u2019re her responsibility and hers only. She usually fed them and refills their water whenever she comes home from school. Two months ago she got her first job. She works some days after school and on weekends. So I understand she\u2019ll have to adjust their feeding routine a bit. When she\u2019s not at work or school, she\u2019s out with her friends. Since she has started working she\u2019s been forgetting to feed her lizards. There\u2019s even been instances where she has went days without feeding them. Even when she\u2019s home I remind her constantly and she still doesn\u2019t feed them. About two weeks ago I did tell her if she didn\u2019t keep up with feeding them regularly, I was giving them away to a shelter. Fast forward she\u2019s still \u201cforgetting\u201d to feed them, leaving me to do it. So I kept my word and give them away to a shelter. Now she\u2019s mad at me, she says I could\u2019ve fed them for her. She says she doesn\u2019t have enough time on her hands and a lot on her plate, so she forgets to feed them. I do agree that she has to adjust to her new schedule, but she does have free time. The one minute it takes to feed her pets, she chooses to spend it with her friends.

You gave several warnings before you pulled the trigger. If the lizards were on a daily feeding schedule before, then forgetting to feed them for days is extremely concerning neglect, possibly cruel to the animal. Just because your daughter had an understandable reason for forgetting doesn't make it any less shitty for the animal.", "NTA. You did the best thing for the lizards. Your daughter was guilty of animal neglect.", "NTA - it seems like you gave her plenty of notice to step up or reap the consequences. She made her choices.", "NTA. I would have gone about this differently, but it's not an automatically bad punishment.", "NTA, if you don't feed your pets you loose the pets. very good of you to give her the opportunity to learn this the easy way", "NTA, Pets are a responsibility, if you can\u2019t even be bothered to feed them then you shouldn\u2019t have them.", "NTA\n\nAnimal neglect is never okay, it's the responsibility of the owner to gauge whether or not they have the time and energy to care for their animals in the way they deserve. When the owner is no longer able to fulfill that duty then the right thing to do is find a new home for the pets where they do receive that care. \n\nSure you could have fed them for her but it's not your job to do so and if you don't want to take on the burden then you have the right to not take it on. \n\nThis is a learning lesson for your daughter. Don't have pets unless you can provide the adequate amount of care.", "> She says she doesn\u2019t have enough time on her hands and a lot on her plate, so she forgets to feed them.\n\n\"I'm too busy to feed the living beings I took responsibility for\".\n\nWell then they are being taken away. NTA.", "NTA. \n\n>she doesn\u2019t have enough time on her hands and a lot on her plate\n\nAnd that is why she should not have her pets anymore. Because she is neglecting them.", "NTA - if she doesn't have time to feed them, she doesn't have time to be responsible for the animals, and as such they need to be rehomed to someone who is committed to looking after them. It's insanely selfish of her to say she doesn't have time to feed them - it's such a quick job. What it actually means is that she doesn't think about them at all and that's why she's not feeding them - she's forgetting they exist. People who want pets as decorations Sheesh.", "This is a tough one tbh. I'm going with YTA. At her age  her lack of responsibility is kinda a parental failure. I absolutely agree that she needs to step up but 2 weeks isn't a lot of time to correct this error. Forbidding her from visiting her friends until she improves would have been a better option. Those lizards aren't getting adopted.", "ESH. She took care of them for two whole years and that\u2019s big when you\u2019re just a teenager. And being a teenager both working and studying was a lot on her plates.\n\nYes, she\u2019s being irresponsible. But there\u2019s many way to teach her a lesson and you used the cruelest way.", "YTA. I don't understand why you didn't ground her until she proved herself to be responsible. Also, I'm sorry, but at her age you, as her parent, need to take some of this blame.", "YABTA: The lizards had no say in this you just dumped them off on a shelter and who's going to adopt two lizards? Nobody, they won't even try. You might as well have let them go out back or bashed their heads in with a rock. Your daughter is irresponsible and lacks empathy towards other living things. So are you.", "YTA. Come on, your daughter is probably overwhelmed with school and her new job. Was there no way to help/teach her?\n\nI feel bad for the lizards, poor guys.", "NTA", "The daughter is sixteen. Old enough to know living things must eat to survive. She did it for two years, all of the sudden she can't remember? This is just her not prioritizing things. I don't know how you feed lizards, but before she went to hang with her friends or before bed, she could not do it? NTA.", "This has been going on for two months, it's only that OP set the ultimatum two weeks ago. Their daughter still couldn't be bothered to stick to a regular feeding schedule. Part of growing up is learning that actions have consequences.  \n\nNTA.", "Can\u2019t blame every child\u2019s mistake on bad parenting. It sounds like good parenting. OP informed her child of the problem and what the consequences would be if the child continued. And she did not set unrealistic expectations. \n\nAsking her to feed her own pet is the absolute bare minimum for pet ownership. Daughter has shown that she is not worthy of owning a pet, so she doesn\u2019t get to keep the pet.", "He warned her this was going to happen if she didn't start caring for her animals, and she didn't care for them anyway. She fucked around and found out. And the animals are now going to be with someone who will feed them.", "The cruellest way would be to do nothing and let the daughter kill her pet lizards through neglect.", "Life is often cruel. If she did this to a child, the child would have to go somewhere else.\n\nYou\u2019re actually making the OP\u2018s case for her. You\u2019re saying that working and studying is a lot for a teenager; which means she should not have a pet if she can\u2019t take care of it.", "Umm... I can list several local shelters who will adopt out lizards and other reptiles as long as they\u2019re legal to own in the state.  Why would a shelter take in lizards just to kill them and lower their adoption rates?", "Not every shelter is run bei PETA.", "School holidays?", "You cannot compared that scenario together. If a 16 year old had a child then that\u2019s a whole other problem.\ud83d\ude02", "I think it\u2019s fair to compare a 16 year old having a pet lizard, which doesn\u2019t seem to be a huge responsibility at face value, to someone who is may be 7 to 10 years old or having a child. In both cases, if you neglect the animal or person who is in your care, someone will take it away from you."]}
