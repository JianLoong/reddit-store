Having a child-free wedding is a valid choice, but it comes along with the knowledge that some guests with young children won't be able to attend.

Just no. Her friends if they are using sitters means they are not newborn babies. Also child free weddings have exceptions for the family of the bride and groom - there is a hierachy of what is allowed kids of siblings of the bride and groom or kids of bride and groom if they have them- then everyone else has to stick to the rules.

However, 5 months old is not a super newborn. Leaving a baby that age with a sitter for a couple of hours is pretty normal. In the US at least, lots of parents would be back at work by that point.\n\nA child free wedding is also a reasonable thing. I say that despite having 3 kids. It does sort of feel like you are trying to punish her for not making an exception for you. You are never going to be apart from your child for a couple of hours for the first 6 months of life? Every single person you trust will be at the wedding or otherwise unavailable? NAH", "NTA\nNo one can make you leave your baby with a sitter if you aren't comfortable with that decision. Are you going alone or with a partner? If you're going alone, could the other parent ( if involved), due to the lack of a better word, 'babysit'? It's fair that she's disappointed but your child comes first.", "If the wedding\u2019s in the same town, it does seem like you are being extra difficult.\n\nAre you not planning on being away from your baby for a couple of hours at all in the first five months? It sounds like you are single and there is no involved other parent, but if there is, leave the baby with them. If there isn\u2019t, how will you be supporting yourself? Who will watch the baby while you\u2019re at work? \n\nAnd let\u2019s be clear. You\u2019re not looking out for your kid. A five month old baby will not suffer reactive attachment disorder from being away from its parent for a few hours. It is the rare baby that age who has never been apart from a parent. You know that, right? Look, I understand first time parent to be jitters. My daughter compares me and my husband to Clyde\u2019s parents on the loud house because we were so overprotective.

A CF wedding just isn't feasible for all parents. You're not comfortable leaving your child with a sitter when they're so young, and that's completely normal.

She can\u2019t eat the cake and have it too. Having a childfree wedding means some people aren\u2019t going to make it and you shouldn\u2019t throw a tantrum over it.

I can understand you not wanting to leave your baby with a sitter, but it's also understandable that your sister is upset that you are making no effort to attend her wedding to support her. Is the babys father not involved, or do you not have a friend you trust who could look after the baby for a few hours, because you have a long time to find something to make it work if you care about being there.\n\nAnd generally I agree that if people want a child free wedding they need to accept that some people won't attend, but I imagine it stings when it's your own sibling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister needs to accept that if she puts restrictions, someone will not come. \n\nNTA", "Info, is it normal to have a Sister Of The Bride speech?", "NTA.

For one thing, you may be breastfeeding, so expressing enough for a whole day away from your baby will be a huge task. For another your baby may not be developmentally ready to be left alone all day. Your sister is NTA for wanting a child-free wedding; you\u2019re NTA for not being able to be there.", "NTA. Your sister is fully entitled to set rules for who can and can't attend her wedding; having a \"child free\" event is not asshole behaviour. However, anyone who designates their wedding \"child free\" or sets any other kind of limit on who can attend should expect that there will be some people who decline to attend as a result. \n\nYour sister knows that you're pregnant and therefore knew that you would have a small child at the time of the wedding, so she knew that *she was specifically excluding your baby* (among others) and putting a burden on you to figure out what to do about that. She doubled down on this when you asked her to make an exception to the rule and she said no. IMO this is still not asshole behaviour necessarily, but people's mileage may vary there.\n\nWhere she becomes the asshole is trying to dictate your answer to the dilemma she has put you in. She does not have the right to tell you how to parent your child, or demand that you prioritise her big day over your child's safety and comfort. **You are not the asshole for prioritizing your baby over your sister. Your sister is an adult and will be fine (if a little disappointed) without you.** \n\nObviously, if there is someone who will not be attending the wedding and who you would trust to mind your baby, that would be a good solution that would make everyone happy, but it sure sounds like there isn't in this case, otherwise you'd have taken that solution already. I'm not going to second-guess you on that, because I have less information than you do and I, also, should not tell you how to parent your child. \n\nThis is a minor point, but your mom's offer to babysit for part of the day, so you can both attend part of the wedding, is also a possible solution.

That way you are steps away- I completely understand not leaving your baby with strangers. The reception you can skip unless she is okay with kids there. I hired a sitter (paid for an hour but really needed 20 min for the ceremony for 2 (sleeping) infants of guests because I really didn\u2019t want any screaming children during the ceremony but both flew from far away to come, obviously with their kids (6 months and 6 weeks, respectively.)

If it were just a friend's, no, but a sibling's is a little different. I think 5 months is old enough to be left with a trusted friend or vetted sitter for a few hours. I was leaving my son with my ex-MIL for hours at 6 weeks or so because I had to - I had to go back to work. But I'm not you, and I'm not in your situation.

You were in that situation, and it really happened to you, obviously. If it happens to OP, she will have to adjust many things about her life, including the wedding.
