In the US at least, lots of parents would be back at work by that point.\n\nA child free wedding is also a reasonable thing. I say that despite having 3 kids. It does sort of feel like you are trying to punish her for not making an exception for you. You are never going to be apart from your child for a couple of hours for the first 6 months of life? Every single person you trust will be at the wedding or otherwise unavailable? N A H\n\nEdit: Changing to NTA because someone informed me that OP said in the comments that her husband recently died.

Goodness.", "NTA\nNo one can make you leave your baby with a sitter if you aren't comfortable with that decision. Are you going alone or with a partner?

It sounds like you are single and there is no involved other parent, but if there is, leave the baby with them. If there isn\u2019t, how will you be supporting yourself? Who will watch the baby while you\u2019re at work? \n\nAnd let\u2019s be clear. You\u2019re not looking out for your kid. A five month old baby will not suffer reactive attachment disorder from being away from its parent for a few hours. It is the rare baby that age who has never been apart from a parent. You know that, right? Look, I understand first time parent to be jitters. My daughter compares me and my husband to Clyde\u2019s parents on the loud house because we were so overprotective.

Your sister is fully entitled to set rules for who can and can't attend her wedding; having a \"child free\" event is not asshole behaviour. However, anyone who designates their wedding \"child free\" or sets any other kind of limit on who can attend should expect that there will be some people who decline to attend as a result. \n\nYour sister knows that you're pregnant and therefore knew that you would have a small child at the time of the wedding, so she knew that *she was specifically excluding your baby* (among others) and putting a burden on you to figure out what to do about that. She doubled down on this when you asked her to make an exception to the rule and she said no. IMO this is still not asshole behaviour necessarily, but people's mileage may vary there.\n\nWhere she becomes the asshole is trying to dictate your answer to the dilemma she has put you in. She does not have the right to tell you how to parent your child, or demand that you prioritise her big day over your child's safety and comfort. **You are not the asshole for prioritizing your baby over your sister. Your sister is an adult and will be fine (if a little disappointed) without you.** \n\nObviously, if there is someone who will not be attending the wedding and who you would trust to mind your baby, that would be a good solution that would make everyone happy, but it sure sounds like there isn't in this case, otherwise you'd have taken that solution already. I'm not going to second-guess you on that, because I have less information than you do and I, also, should not tell you how to parent your child. \n\nThis is a minor point, but your mom's offer to babysit for part of the day, so you can both attend part of the wedding, is also a possible solution.

I hired a sitter (paid for an hour but really needed 20 min for the ceremony for 2 (sleeping) infants of guests because I really didn\u2019t want any screaming children during the ceremony but both flew from far away to come, obviously with their kids (6 months and 6 weeks, respectively.)

She made a choice, and so are you!!", "NTA. \n\nShe is entitled to a child free wedding and you are entitled to say no if that doesn't work for you. \n\n\nYour child will be 5 months at the time. I understand not wanting to be away from your baby at that age and also that the people you would trust to watch your baby would be at the wedding.", "NTA! that's crazy you would think that, she shouldn't be upset but rather understanding that you just had a baby and would prefer to not part with it.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU Are right, she is wrong.", "NTA. Your sister is well within her rights to request a child free wedding, but she can\u2019t expect you to attend and leave a very young baby. She could have made an exception for you but she hasn\u2019t, so there\u2019s no way you will be able to attend.", "NTA. All weddings are optional for any guest.", "NTA. She can have a child free wedding but you don't have to attend. I don't blame you not wanting to leave your 5 month old with a sitter you are unfamiliar with or at all really. At that age the little ones are still the most fragile and vulnerable.", "NTA. Your sister is well within her rights to request a child free wedding, just as you\u2019re entitled to say you can\u2019t attend. Both viewpoints are valid. You accepted her viewpoint, so she should accept yours. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. A five month old baby? Anyone would want, even need to be with them. Sister can make an exception or deal with not having OP there.", "NTA\n\nAttending a wedding isn't compulsory.\n\nShe set conditions for attendance, you can decline without prejudice if you don't want to meet the conditions.", "NTA. If you insist on a child free wedding, you don't get to whine when someone accepts your terms and chooses not to attend. The only scenario in which she would be in the right to be upset is if you ignored her request for only adults and brought your child anyway, which you respectfully aren't doing.", "NTA \n\nOne of the things people who throw child free events need to understand is that yes they have the right to have that rule BUT that rule will mean not everyone can or will attend.", "NTA- I wouldn't be leaving my 5 month old with anyone but family either.  It's your sister's choice to have a child free wedding, which you seem to have zero qualms with. Your sister is not exempt from the consequences of her choices.", "NTA\n\nFor me it's all about the venue more than the principle. I'm sure a trusted friend or very qualified sitter would be ok IF you were within 5 mins in the same place but the baby just not in the room. Is the venue a hotel for example where a babysitter could be there in a room BUT you are also within 5 mins if there is an issue? \n\nAlternately: You could attend for a little bit and have your mom look after the baby AT the venue (but outside the hall for example.) \n\nIf neither is possible, and your sister won't budge, then yeah, fair game to miss it, she is being entirely unreasonable.", "I understand her feeling upset that you can\u2019t be there but it\u2019s 100% valid that you can\u2019t leave your five month old alone. At my wedding we were child free other than breast fed babies. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it\u2019s a compromise! \nNTA", "NTA you\u2019ll have a five month old baby I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to leave them alone I definitely wouldn\u2019t. It would be different if you where demanding  she let you bring your baby but your not your respecting her rule.", "Not attending a child free event when you have a child is a natural consequence. \n\nThis is your sisters choice. You're respecting it. No worries. She can control her guest list. You control who looks after your child. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It's so stupid. People want childfree weddings and then lose their temper when guests with kids decline. You're going to have a baby and it's a momentous occasion. You do what you feel is best for your baby.", "NTA\n\nThere is a world of difference between a sitter for a 5 year old and a 5 month old. Many parents\u2014especially first time parents are nowhere near ready to leave their baby with a sitter. \n\nYour sister is being ridiculous.", "NTA. I just had a child free wedding. I invited everyone I wanted to be there, with 0 expectations.", "NTA... I don't trust no strangers with my babies... your sister is child free so she dosent understand the anxiety of it all...", "NTA. A five month old isn\u2019t a toddler and young child you have to chase around or who would cause a ruckus. Your baby at that age would basically be attached to you or someone else. This would be very easy for her to say yes to and it wouldn\u2019t change a thing about her wedding.", "Definitely NTA I wouldn't have felt comfortable leaving my little one at that age! Sorry your sister doesn't understand that.", "NTA. Child free weddings are fine, but they come with the obvious possibility that some people will not be able, or want, to go. Your sister needs to realize this.", "NTA. Not a chance in hell I'd leave my 6 month old with anyone except my parents or my partners parents. Even then I'd be reluctant to do it over night. No chance I'd every leave a kid that young with a sitter overnight, even one I knew well.     \nYour sister is suffering the consequences of a child free wedding. It's that simple.", "Definetly NTA, but question is, where's the father? Sorry in advance if father is out of the picture", "NTA. \n\nFully appreciate that she wants a kid free wedding, but you have a 5 month old. It's completely understandable that you don't wish to leave your baby with some sitter.\n\nAs she's not allowing children (which is her right, it's her wedding after all), she also needs to accept that this places limitations on other people's availability and ability to attend.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t have left my baby at that age for a wedding either. I fully respect people\u2019s choice to have child-free weddings but when they make that choice they need to be adult enough to understand that it means some people won\u2019t come. Everyone gets to have choices and boundaries, not just your sister.", "NTA because of the multiple reasons you have stated - \n\n- your baby will only be 5 months old\n- your soon-to-be-trusted babysitter (your mum) will also be at the wedding\n- your husband sadly died\n- your in-laws live in Canada\n\nYour sister is unbelievably selfish in her reaction to you. If she wants you there, baby comes too, if she doesn\u2019t want your baby there then you can\u2019t come either - it\u2019s as simple as that!", "NTA. They want it purely childfree, as is their choice. You don\u2019t want to leave your child with a sitter, a valid choice whatever your baby\u2019s age. They are the assholes for trying to break down a line you\u2019ve drawn. Your sister needs to decide if she can make an exception, or if she\u2019d really rather get mad at you over a tight place SHE put YOU in. She also wants mom at the wedding, which of course means that mom can\u2019t accommodate you like she offered to. I\u2019m gonna go ahead and say again that you\u2019re NTA, and your sister is an epic one for refusing to offer any alternatives that are within your comfort zone.", "NTA. If you nurse, attending a long wedding will be a pain. You'll leak, have to pump, and pumping at a wedding is not fun. I did it years ago.", "NTA - she can't force you to attend her wedding. It makes perfect sense that your child comes first. Either she's adamant that it's a child-free wedding and you stay at home. Or she discusses with her partner how they can help you be at the wedding for a short while. Exempel baby during ceremony and your mother holding baby during speech.", "NTA. Your sister not making an exception with you was reasonable, and your reaction was definitely right. You politely declined and understood her point of view. However, your sister needs to understand that you have every right to say no as well.\n\nAnd to be honest, if it means so much to her that you come to her wedding that she's getting worked up over it, she should make an exception for you .", "My baby only nursed so I wouldn't have been able to leave her for more than 3 hours at 5 months as she didn't drink a bottle. \n\nI think the trade off with your mom is a reasonable compromise.", "NTA.\n\nChildfree weddings are like destination weddings - not everyone will be willing/able to attend.\n\nSister is TA for being pushy about it.", "NTA. If she wants a child free wedding she drew her line in the sand. I\u2019m not a Mom but if you don\u2019t want to leave your young child with anyone and she doesn\u2019t want to make an exception, she made her decision, not you.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable leaving a baby that young to go anywhere. To each their own but she will understand if and when she decides to have offspring of her own.", "NTA. Her boundary is no kids. Your boundary is not leaving an infant with a sitter you don\u2019t really know. She doesn\u2019t really have the right to be mad, especially when your mom offered to split the time and she said no. She can\u2019t have her cake and eat it too.\n\nEdit: OP, I read a comment that said your husband passed away? If that\u2019s the case I am so very sorry for your loss. Your sister wasn\u2019t the asshole for wanting a child free wedding, but now she definitely is one for being so demanding in this circumstance.", "NTA you can have a childfree wedding but you have to expect that some people won't be comfortable with that.", "NTA. It's her right to have a childfree wedding. It is your right to decide that you're not attending. It's not her right to be pissy about it afterwards to her now pregnant sister. Your priority will be your baby and your peace of mind, you're not comfortable with a sitter and that's all the explanation you needed to give.", "NTA. Everyone is free to have the wedding they want - child free, destination, dry, vegan, non-vegan-absolutely-everything-has-meat or whatever. \n\nBut every one of those additions has the potential to keep people from coming. And anyone who is not going to accept this is TA.", "NTA", "NTA, it's a 5 month baby, it would be better to make a compromise where you get a sitter to be close by, and then you could slip away for a few minutes a few times, that keeps it child free and you there, while not completely away. It's a fairly small accomodation from both sides.", "NTA! It\u2019s a very normal thing to want to stay with your newborn rather than leaving them with a sitter. Does it make for an unfortunate situation? Sure! But you\u2019re not being a jerk or unreasonable here.", "NTA. Ask your sister if she has ever heard of a little thing called Zoom or Skype or one of the other live chat apps. Arrange to give your well-written speech over zoom when the time comes. You will be tempted to have the baby sitting on your lap when you do it, but you probably shouldn't,  since the wedding is child free.", "NTA. One of mine refused to take a bottle. At all. Ever. That one could be in daycare for a good stretch after solid food was introduced, but I would not have been able to leave the baby for 6-7 hours at 5 months.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable leaving your 5 month old with a sitter (which I wouldn\u2019t) then stay home. It was your sister choice to have a child free wedding (which is fine), but she has to respect your choice to decline.", "NTA. There is absolutely nothing wrong with child free weddings, and I totally understand why people go that route. This is the part that annoys me, is when the bride and groom throw a fit when guests have to put their children first, and decline going to the wedding. Your sister is being a bridezilla and needs to stop being a brat. You focus on you and your child, not a day that is honestly only going to be important to your sister and her fiance.", "NTA, I had a child-free ceremony mainly because I had a rooftop wedding. My best friend whom I told I understood if she needed or wanted to be dropped from my wedding party because she had a 2-week-old baby insisted she would be there for me. I in turn welcomed her baby on our special day. His being in attendance did not spoil our day or ceremony. Opting to have a child-free ceremony came with the understanding my guest list was shorter. The sister does not have to be flexible but neither does the OP.", "NTA. She's perfectly entitled to have a child-free wedding, but she needs to be prepared that some people she invites won't be able to attend. She seems to have made that decision without consideration of who may or may not attend as a result. Or, she expects everyone to move mountains to accommodate her wedding. That's not your responsibility. When you become a parent, your child becomes your priority, and you're within your right to not pass your child off to a babysitter you don't even know.", "NTA. You're not kicking up a fuss, you just know that you won't be ready to leave your 5 month old baby with a stranger. Your sister is being a bit dramatic here. Your mom offered a solution, and she doesn't want that. You offered two solutions, and she doesn't want those either. She cannot force anyone to attend her wedding.", "NTA. You received and invite and due to the nature of the request. You even asked for an exception and it was denied. I feel you have done all you can at this point. Don't feel bad for about it at all. Enjoy your time with your little one at home instead.", "NTA. \nYour sister is perfectly entitled to have a child free wedding, but part of that is understanding that by doing so she makes it difficult for some parents to attend. \nShe can\u2019t have it both ways, especially if your child is that young.", "NTA if your sister can't understand why you don't want to leave your almost newborn baby she's acting spoiled.", "NTA. 5 months is not 5 years. \n\nThe only way I would do this is if my sister let me bring a sitter to the venue and stay in a private area so I could check on baby often. \n\nYour sister is delusional.", "NTA\n\nShe is allowed to have a childfree wedding. You are allowed to stay home with the baby. Based on comments, it's understandable why there are no other available adults to watch the baby while you attend. My condolences for your loss \ud83e\udec2", "NTA what people need to remember that wedding invites are just that invites and not court summons.  I'm childfree and when having my wedding I wouldn't expect anyone to yes to coming period but especially if they had a baby under 1.  I would have gone NAH if not for how your sister has reacted.", "NTA - it\u2019s a shame you guys can\u2019t come up with a compromise (We had a child free wedding, but we made exceptions for close family and babes in arms - we just asked people to be respectful and try to keep them happy as much as possible) There\u2019s a huge difference between a load of 8 year olds charging round, knocking granny off her feet and a small baby sleeping in a pram, but ultimately it\u2019s up to your sister to decide what\u2019s more important to her. xxx", "People need to realize that if they want Child Free events, they have to accept that not everyone is going to want to go to them for whatever reason. You can't get mad because people don't want the same thing as you, you just have to accept it and move on.\n\nETA: You are respecting your sisters choices, she has chosen her wedding to be Child Free, so you are respectfully not attending with your 5mo child. I'm a guy, and would make that same choice.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This breaks my heart. You don't even bring up that your husband passed away in the main post. It makes it so much harder for you and I wish that your sister can be more considerate. \n\nWhen I got married and wedding planning before covid hit and stepped on our plans, one of my bridesmaid who is also my sister in law had a newborn who would be 6 months. Not only did I make arrangements for her to bring her baby in our limo so she would be able to nurse if needed but also invited her parents to look after her baby at the ceremony and reception. I'm so sorry you are going through this unnecessary stress. You have every right to decline.", "NTA. Her friends have trusted sitters because their kids are older and they had time to gain trust in sitters. You haven\u2019t even had your kids yet so who knows if you\u2019ll gain a trusted sitter in that time. Also, it sounds like you might be a single mother?  That means the only family you have to rely on is your own. If any of her friends are married parents, they\u2019d likely have 2 families to rely on. That\u2019s what one of my sisters did for my other sister\u2019s wedding. She had her SIL come with to the out of town wedding to babysit my niece.", "Nta - your sister is exercising her right to have a child free wedding, and you are exercising yours to not go. She is being selfish.", "NTA. She's allowed to have a child free wedding, and parents are allowed to opt to not attend.\n\nPeople have a hard time understanding this but leaving your first child is darn near impossible. By the 3rd child, you're a lot more willing to hand them all away.", "NTA", "NTA.  It\u2019s tough explaining life with a 5 month old to another baby.", "People with young babies normally hire sitters to be in another room at the hotel.  If you're uncomfortable doing that,  that is your boundary,  and that's totally fine.  Nta. People will give you shit for not being willing to hire someone to sit with your sleeping infant in another room at the same hall,  but you will have to be prepared for that, like anyone who has a boundary.", "Nta.\n\nShe's choosing that she doesn't wish to have ALL of her family there. That's her, imo, very selfish choices. And every choice has consequences. She may not have learned that yet, but this seems the perfect opportunity for her to realise that the world does not revolve around her, whether it's her wedding or not.", "NTA. \n\nOffer to make a video speech they can play at the wedding. \n\nDoes anyone actually enjoy those speeches?", "She made the rule the baby can't come, not you.  You made the rule you are not leaving your baby.  The two rules do not mesh, but I'm with you.  She don't need you there, and if she keeps that attitude, you don't need her around with the grief she gives you.  This may not be her first wedding, but in today's world, it probably isn't her last.\n\nNTA", "Is there a father to the child, can't he be with it during the wedding?\n\nWere is the wedding? Is there a hotel nearby ore somewere ellse the baby and father can be so you can get away to feed if needed?", "NTA. Your sister is being a diva. If she wants you there she needs to accept that your infant will be there.", "NTA. My first is a little over four months and still nursing every three hours. Pumping is an option but really hard on some of us (and might still be weird depending on timing of the wedding and how long you\u2019d be away.) It\u2019s unfortunate, but she made this choice in a way that ignored her sister\u2019s needs. She\u2019s allowed to do that, of course, but she can\u2019t hold it against you when you have to choose a different course.", "Bring your baby WITH A SITTER.

I mean your weeding is the theme but the party is for the people invited to celebrate.\n\nYour sister is an idiot or hates you.", "NTA, does your sister have a sympathetic bone in her body?  I'm sure as a recent widow, attending any wedding wouldn't be too high on the list of 'want to do' / 'yeah, that's not traumatizing at all' (/s).

Would you and your sister be willing to have a babysitter at the wedding to watch your daughter for key moments in the wedding, like the ceremony, speeches during the reception, etc.? I feel like its easier to trust someone to watch my child for 30 minutes at a time while im very nearby than leaving someone with my child at home for an entire evening. Because I 100% get it, I don't let just anyone watch my daughter. My trusted support system when my daughter was an infant was my immediate family, and if they were all at the same event I was being asked to attend and I couldn't bring my baby, I would have been in a tough spot too. I definitely agree with what others have said too: your sister wanted a child free wedding. She can't be surprised when people with kids don't come. What she can't expect is for everyone to arrange for baby sitters just for her wedding. Some people have those support systems already in place and can afford to do so (babysitters AINT cheap either) and some don't. It is what it is for her.", "You don't need to decide now about attending the wedding that is a long way away. Wait until you have the baby and settle in with motherhood alone.

It's a long year ahead for you and you may realize that having those moments away from your child is good for you too.", "NAH. She's not an AH for wanting a child free wedding and you're not AH for not wanting to leave your 5 month old.\n\nBut a word of advice from an experienced mother and grandmother: by the time this baby is 5 months old, you're going to need a break. You'll need to feel like an adult again, not just a milk making machine and diaper changer.\n\nFind an experienced babysitter or nanny that you can trust and practice leaving the baby with them for an hour at a time. Go out and shop! Have your hair and nails done! You're still YOU even though you're a mommy now. You'll be a better mother if you take care of your needs, too.\n\nBy the time the wedding rolls around, you might feel OK with leaving baby for a few hours. \n\nBy the time the 2nd baby arrives, you'll be pushing him/her on anyone who'll take them, LOL!", "I really really really don't understand all the AITA regarding child free weddings... why is it always a problem?????  \nIm mexican. And in mexico weddings are most of the time childfree, and I've never EVER eveeeer heard about a problem because of it... and yes SISTERS are supposed to be with the family in weddings, so also the rules bend for sisters. But what I dont understand tho, is why would you want to bring your new human to a place where is unbelievably loud, full of people and their germs. She will be overestimulated, won't be able to sleep and will for sure get sick, EVEN if you don't let anybody touch her.  \nYes your sister wants your there. And yes she could bend the rules...  \nYou guys should meet in the middle, pay for a nanny for that evening and bring her with.

I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this situation, it sounds like your sister is being very unreasonable- wanting a child-free wedding is fine but expecting a mother to leave her newborn with a sitter is unreasonable and not her place. 5 months is still really young and I understand not wanting anyone outside your family caring for the baby. Your sister will have to work out a way to compromise or accept that you can\u2019t be there.", "I suppose there are two sides to this.   \nFirstly, your sister is perfectly entitled to suggesting a child-free wedding.

You will not have fun at the wedding while you worry about your baby.\n\nMy sister got married just as I was about to embark on my career as a teacher. She got married at what was to be the second week of school for my first year of teaching. She insisted that I ask for the day off, but I felt terrible asking for leave literally nine days into my job.  It was a high risk community of kids and it would have been very wrong to leave them so soon after having them entrusted to me.  I felt that I had to choose family over my job, so I ultimately turned down my job offer altogether in order to support my sister. A decade later and I have zero relationship with my sister and I regret not choosing my own priorities over the wedding.  It was a missed opportunity for me.\n\nYour baby is going to be young. It's okay to be selfish and protective of your newborn.  I am proud of you for prioritizing your baby. Stand your ground and enjoy your special moments with your daughter.", "NTA. \n\nWould your sister feel comfortable with you hiring a sitter at the venue? So that you can enjoy the wedding but the sitter and baby are chilling within checking-in distance? A lot of weddings I go to have a babysitting room for young children of family members of the couple.", "NTA OP. Maybe you could go to the reception with LO; make your speech and then leave. If she's not compromising it's her fault. Her feelings are valid, but your daughter is your priority.", "NTA\n\nIf someone is having a child free wedding they should not allow themselves to be offended when parents are unable to attend.  Lisa has a sad lack of sympathy since your child will be 5 months old.  It's not like they're 5 YEARS old and can reasonably be with a sitter.  You and your mother offered a reasonable compromise/solution and Lisa struck it down.  This is 100% on her.", "No. You\u2019re not the asshole, your sister is being a pain in the ass.", "NTA. Your sister can make her choices about her weddings, and that's fantastic, but there are pros and cons to both choices. Have kids, you may have loud interruptions. No kids, and some people won't attend. I think you and your mother trying to come up with a compromise is perfectly fine, and great! Can you offer to Zoom in so you can give a speech? I understand that it will probably be a \"no\" from your sister, but at least you've tried everything to accommodate.   \n\n\nI also understand you not being confident you'll be able (ready) to leave your 5 month old baby with someone who isn't family. It takes time to find sitters you trust and are comfortable with. :)", "NTA.

OP, you are respecting your sister\u2019s choice to have a child free wedding\u2014by not bringing your child.  The fact that that also means you\u2019re not attending is your sister\u2019s choice, since you offered a solution and she turned it down.", "Nta, I also wouldn't trust anyone with my my baby you don't know how many sick fucks are out there", "NTA - I think the only issue is sister being mad at you for complying with her wishes to not have baby there.

Your sister is absolutely free to issue invitations on whatever conditions she wants, and you are absolutely free to accept - or decline - those invitations with those conditions. \n\nI think your sister is TA for not wanting her nieces and nephews at her wedding.

I have a 5 month old baby and she just started day care last week. It was a really rough week for me and I cried the first day she went. So I can imagine what it would be like to be in your position. If it was me, I wouldn't go because I don't want to be without my baby even for a second. \n\nMaybe, you can do FaceTime on a screen so you can do the speech while being with your baby.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nIn the end of the day, it\u2019s your choice if you want to go to a wedding or not, with or without conditions from the bride and groom. You respected her by saying you won\u2019t be attending because you can\u2019t meet their conditions. End of conversation. \n\nLisa is, of course, in her right to have a child-free wedding BUT she cannot be offended when you meet her conditions by not bringing the baby to the wedding. It\u2019s your choice, as a mother, to stay with your child, and no one else\u2019s.\n\nI asked my mum a couple of weeks ago what she thinks of child-free weddings (we have attended a lot of weddings when I was under the age of 6, non of them being child-free).  She said she wouldn\u2019t have attended without me under any circumstances, not because there wasn\u2019t anyone to babysit, but because she didn\u2019t want to. That is personal preference, of course, but it is a choice. People have their priorities. Your sister can\u2019t be offended because your baby comes first.", "NTA. I wouldnt be able to leave my son with a sitter like that either. I have done overnights with my parents, who are in town, when the hubs and I needed a break/date night. So NTA and your sister could make one exception, especially if the baby is still breastfed at that point. Don't know what you plan to do or what will happen, but you're a Mom and need to do what is best for you and your baby.", "NTA. You can't say it's child-free and then be surprised when people don't/can't come. It's like being surprised when you book a destination wedding and people turn down the invitation.", "NTA.

She is TA for trying to guilt-trip you for putting your baby\u2019s needs above her wedding preferences.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. \n\nI must admit that I shook my head when your Mom offered to look after your baby while you attend part of the ceremony but your sister wouldn\u2019t allow it because she wants your parents to be there the whole time. The lead-up to a wedding is not only stressful for the bride and groom but also stressful for the parents.

Plus I think it\u2019s a good thing OP prioritizes her kid over a wedding.", "NTA a 5 month old is not like a 5 year old, I\u2019m assuming OP is going to be nursing. OP\u2019s mom is being helpful , kudos to her.", "NTA. If you haven\u2019t had kids you don\u2019t realize. A 5 month old is hard to leave with a sitter. They just need mom. \n\nI took my ~4 month old to a wedding last summer, and he slept against my chest in a carrier the whole time. I get no kids, but I think that shouldn\u2019t include tiny babies that aren\u2019t even hardly separate from mom yet.", "NTA.  I totally support a couple's choice to have a child free wedding but at the same time, they also have to realize that there will be a few people they invited that won't come.  Either as OP here and doesn't feel comfortable leaving a 5-month old baby with a sitter and there are others who won't come just because they can't bring their kids.\n\nIt's a trade off that the bride has to accept or they shouldn't be going child free.", "NTA \n\nJust because she is getting married doesnt give her say over everyones lives. Wedding are optional, children are not. Thank you, enjoy your wedding.", "nta. \n\nif she wants a completely child free wedding and won\u2019t allow you to bring your 5 month old baby who\u2019s too young for a sitter then she has no right to be pissed", "NTA. Your sister can\u2019t have it both ways and is being unfair to you. A 5 month old is still a very young baby and it is almost impossible for a new mom to be away from them for a period of time especially if you\u2019re nursing. Congratulations and best wishes on your pregnancy and tell your sister to get over herself.", "NTA it's her choice not to have kids at her wedding but she can't then be offended if people can't come. Your baby will be very young and it's completely understandable that you don't feel comfortable leaving them with someone you don't know.", "NTA- if people want a child free wedding then they need to accept that some parents will not attend. If your sister is throwing a tantrum because you will be staying home with your baby then that's on her. You go enjoy your baby!", "NTA. Your choice to attend or not, just as it was her choice to have a child-free wedding. She doesn't have a right to be angry. I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving my baby either.", "NTA - Your sister has to understand that times are not really ideal for some stranger to be watching such a new baby. At 5 mths old the baby hasn't built any immunities. Currently we have a covid, flu, and rsv pandemic. RSV is very dangerous for a baby so young. \n\nIts your responsibility to make a decision that is best for your child, who comes before anyone else. She can be upset but she doesn't get to disrespect you about it. How about if you're baby gets sick? Will she be breaking nights helping take care of it? Will she be coming over to cook & clean so you can rest? \n\nIt doesn't seem like you can reason with her. I'd just send her a message being very clear and tell her this topic is not up for debate. You wish her the best and you're doing what's best for you and your family.\n\nEdit: Read that OP's husband passed away. My condolences to her as this is something that's very difficult & emotional. \nIn my opinion it makes her sister a bigger AH for knowing this & still trying to guilt OP into feeling bad about not attending.", "NTA.\n\nLisa is allowed to have a child-free wedding.\n\nOP is allowed to decline to attend said wedding.\n\nLisa is *not* allowed to give OP a hard time for declining, and that's why she's TA.", "NTA\nThey set a restriction that is in no way feasible for your life with a brand new baby. \n\nThey are totally allowed to have a child free event.

And she should appreciate that leaving a 5-6 months old child with strangers (sitters) might be an acceptable option for some people but not for you. What your mother offered sounds like a good and reasonable solution. I was in a sort of similar situation:\n\nI was a teen when my mom had another child and we needed to attend my mom's god son's wedding - she clearly had to be there and was expected to have an important part in the ceremony. Our solution was that me and my dad would \"take turns\" staying home with my sibling (also about 6 months at the time) and my mom would still get away from the celebration during the day to see the baby. And of course it was possible only because the wedding was about 30 minutes by car from where we lived.", "NTA. I don\u2019t leave my kid with sitters and especially not at 5 months old.

Do you think you could ask them to stay nearby at like a hotel or something, and you could dip out of the wedding every couple hours or so to feed the baby/check in? Perhaps that could be a reasonable compromise?\n\nYour sister is allowed to have a kid free wedding, but you're allowed to set boundaries and choose what is best for you and your baby. Neither of you are wrong, per se, but it is a tough situation to make everyone happy.", "The point of a child free wedding is to not have them running around, making a mess or be a burden for every parents present.

As everyone else has said: While she has every right to have a child free wedding, you also have every right to choose not to go because of that. Sounds like you were respectful and tried to come up with a solution with your mom. Her going off on you and saying that you\u2019re punishing her was pretty uncalled for. While I\u2019m sure that she\u2019s just emotional and understandably upset that her sister wont be attending, that\u2019s no excuse for her behavior.

I get that it's their choice, and I respected the choice but what I went through to get to that wedding was insane.  I should have said no and I regret going.

We both absolutely loved the girls name but when she was born for reasons neither of us could explain the name just didn\u2019t suit her.\n\nSo yes, waiting until your baby arrives makes a lot of sense.", "Holy moly yeah her sister should definitely make an exception or even if she doesn't she should also understand that going to a wedding might also be hard for Op mentally as well so adding stressing over finding a 5 month old baby a nanny or babysitter and dealing with this I'm sure recent loss as she's just a few months along might be to much.

Literally nobody gave me grief if I couldn't attend. Most of my friends/acquaintances also have kids though. I think your sister's immature view stems from literally not understanding what it's like to have kids.

I'm a pretty easy going mom overall but leaving my first with a babysitter I didn't know well was a no go until he could communicate.

If your sister wants you there that bad, she will find a solution to make you both happy. Maybe pay a sitter to come and stay with the baby in the back so they can exit fast if she cries? Someone that can keep tabs on her while you do a speech and then you can leave when your obligations are done. I\u2019m not sure where the dad is in all this but you\u2019d pretty much be paying someone to be your partner for the day and handle all the things the dad would.

It's really difficult to leave kids that age with someone else for an extended period of time, especially if they're breastfeeding.

My friend no longer speaks to the bride. \n\nIn my experience the people who behave this way are the most self involved people that exist, and if they have children of their own they become absolutely insufferable performance parents of the worst kind.", "\"'you'll understand too one day\" is all you need to tell your sister", "LMAO I like this phrasing. I\u2019ll have to remember this.", "The ceremony is a bit boring but wedding receptions were the shit when I was a kid. I honestly can't conceive of a child-free wedding. Weddings were always family events growing up, like mini reunions. Saying kids can't go to a wedding would be like saying kids aren't really members of the family. I think the weddings I grew up with are less stuffy and fancy than weddings many people have, so that might be the difference.", "I never get that. As a kid I found weddings exciting, and if the bride paid any attention to me at all I felt like I'd met an Actual Princess. \n\nThe kids at my wedding danced with glowsticks and looked like they were having plenty of fun.", "Weddings are very fun for kids. I had 30 children at my wedding this year. They had a shitload of fun.", "I'm glad it worked out well in your situation, but can I just say I can't stand the weddings where some kids come as exceptions to the general rule? Child-free weddings make sense for so many people. Weddings with a few children so often turn into shit shows where the obviously autistic kids in the family aren't invited or one set of siblings is excluded but the favorite niece attends because she has a special bond with the bride. Invite the kids or don't. It makes perfect sense that someone with an infant can't go to child-free events. OP is NTA.", ">it's boring for the kids\n\nWhat? I loved going to weddings as a kid. You get to eat good food, cake, soda, dance, all the adults give you a bunch of attention.", "Every childfree wedding I\u2019ve been to has made the exception of \u2018babes in arms\u2019 being allowed (aka if you are breastfeeding your baby, if it isn\u2019t mobile yet, those kind of things). You don\u2019t have to make that exception but you then have to accept parents, primarily mothers, of small infants will not be attending your wedding. If you choose to limit your wedding, you have to accept the consequences of those limitations! You can\u2019t have it both ways.", "Personally, I would stay home with 7-10 years old, because at that age they know full well they are being excluded from important family event.\n\nWith 5 months old, someone can push stroller around for the duration of the ceremony literally zero problem.", "Great guidelines!!", "\u201cYou\u2019re prioritizing not interacting with children over celebrating with your family\u201d\u2014exactly, and it seems like some people don\u2019t understand this.", "Your sister is a total asshole. She is calling you, a recent widow, holier than thou for not feeling comfortable leaving your first 5 month old baby with a baby sitter for several hours to attend her child free wedding. Your sister seems to lack compassion and care for you and could have worked to have a compromise with you. Like a compromise would have been letting your baby be in a room in the venue with childcare you trusted that you could regularly see your baby through out the reception. Instead of understanding what you are going through as a recent widow who is current pregnant with your first child she is attacking and judging you and making you into the aggressor. NTA.", "You mean family like the children that you\u2019re excluding already?", "Having a child free wedding is also a great way to \"invite\" someone that you don't want there.  But in this case OPs sister needs to get her head out of her ass.  Who the fuck would leave a kid that young at home?", "This! Also the fact that she is a direct relative of the bride.", "And the child hasn\u2019t even been born yet! The situation with the baby hasn\u2019t been established at all, and they may need a lot of parental attention. It would be irresponsible of OP to promise she could leave her child at home and attend when there\u2019s so much about doing that that she still doesn\u2019t know yet.", "Oh boy I hated weddings as a kid so much because they were so long and boring. To this day listening to wedding speeches makes me miserable.", "Yeah every wedding I've been to has had kids and there's never been an issue. They get to eat cake, run around, dance. Always been a ton of fun.", "One piece of advice: If you made sure basic naming rules apply (spelling not too out there, name goes well with last name etc., there's advice lists out there), DON'T SHARE YOUR POSSIBLE BABY NAMES WITH ANYONE close to you. If you've got ONE trusted friend, okay, but you shouldn't take other people's opinion over your own.\n\nOne of my best friends almost got herself and her husband talked out of their mutual favourite name for their son by her in-laws. I convinced her to stick with what her husband and she agreed on, and she's very happy with it even 7 years later.\n\nIt's just less of a hassle to keep it to yourself until it's final.\n\nThere are websites out there where people rate the way they see certain names (like Ruth = rather old, Kevin = less intelligent etc.) if those public opinions matter to you.\n\nAlso, I found it very helpful with my twins to just use the names when talking to or thinking about my unborn girls for the last 2 months. Every name will feel weird when you haven't used it before, but this way, you'll notice if it just doesn't roll off your tongue.\n\nIn the worst case, keep the last few contenders and decide after you've seen your cute newborn potato.\n\nBest of luck for you both!", "Genuinely asking- how do you trust your mom with your child if she is the one who hired an abusive babysitter for you? I\u2019m assuming you did not tell her the sitter was abusive?", "Yup. I would say nursing infants of direct family or members of the party + their immediate partners should be an exception. Accommodations should be provided for nursing toddlers of the same at a convenient location (for instance, an on-site nanny where the parents can drop in on their kids.) Otherwise, older toddlers and children should remain at home.\n\nGuests should receive an invitation that requests child-free. This way, if there is a new mother, they can choose to stay home with their infant and it doesn\u2019t upset the wedding party as a whole.", "It's a nice time for the parents too, because their kids are in an enclosed space being watched by the aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents who can't/don't want to drink and are so excited to be with the little ones. I think the rise in child-free spaces is a sign of our society's decline. If we don't take care of our young and our old, we're in a bad way.", "Yes! This is so important. I recently suggested this to someone and they did and changed the name they had decided on. \n\nThose are lovely names OP. You could also name your baby for her dad. There are feminine versions of many masculine names. My niece is named after a grandfather that died just before she was born. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about your sister she\u2019s being an AH. You are not. No one is going to question where you are at a strict no kids wedding but they are going to ask her where you are because she should be making a infant exception for you.", "Beautiful names!\n\nWe had a top 3 (Florence, B\u00e9atrice and Elisabeth) and made the choice after the birth. Our oldest is named Florence and her little sister B\u00e9atrice.", "Yeah I got my haircut and ran an errand took about 90mins and I came home to husband nearly in tears because 4 month old had cried the entire time. I fed and left the second he was done to maximise time but about 10mins after leaving he obvs decided he wanted more. Wouldn't take a bottle and tbh if the only reason to express is so you can attend a wedding at 5 months it's a no and that is reasonable expressing is a ball ache! Also not wanting to leave your 5 month old with family for a day at that age is reasonable let alone someone elses 'trusted sitter'. I doubt you could relax and enjoy your day.", "Why wouldn't you hire a baby sitter who is a wet nurse then!? /s", "It especially sucks because that means her husband has been passed for less than a year at most, more likely just a few months (not sure on the timeline). So the sister is trying to tell her grieving widowed sister who has to juggle being a first time mom alone without her husband to just leave her baby with someone and go to her wedding. Never seen someone lacking so much empathy. Her sister is lucky if she decides to keep in contact, because I sure as well wouldn't.", "Absolutely, she needs to bend on this for her own SISTER.   If I were a wedding  guest with kids that I left at home, I'd totally understand the need for the bride's sister to have her baby there.", "Lol if i could have I definitely would have!", "Honestly, I wouldn't even feel obligated to explain why the 5 month old baby of my sibling is allowed to be at my child free wedding... I'm pretty positive my friends would never have a problem with it.\n\n\"Why does your sister and her kid get special treatment???\" they might ask. And my reply would be \"Because they ARE special.\"\n\nIf I'm getting married, I'm allowed to make exceptions as I see fit. You can explain yourself if you want to avoid scoffs and sideways glances. In my mind, anyone who would act that way can just deal with it. I have a family that is extra reasonable by virtue of luck and the fact that we're very small (I have one aunt that I'm still in contact with and she has one kid) so my thoughts on this are probably not the norm. If I had a bunch of aunts and uncles and cousins, some of them would surely be assholes.", "Yes, there's obviously constant, high pitched noise during the weddings, especially during the ceremony, exchanging vows and any speeches. \n\n/s", "I had an outdoor ceremony at my wedding, and at one point an ice cream truck drove by with the music loud enough to make us have to pause a few seconds. Everyone chuckled a bit and then we continued on, no big deal. Granted that\u2019s not the same a baby crying, but it was still an interruption.", "I mean I've got **MOOBS**, but a think having a 38 year old Scots*man* breast feeding *any* kids, so not just yours, is too weird for most/all(?) Folks!", "Yup - she didn\u2019t even know she was pregnant when he passed!! I clicked on the comments (I\u2019m on mobile, and idk how to link unfortunately)\n\nOP is not the asshole"]}
