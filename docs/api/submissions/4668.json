You gotta do what you gotta do to get to work. It's ridiculous to think so many here think you should resort to a shovel when you have a perfectly good snowblower. This is life in a snowbelt, and what about essential workers who work 12-16 hour shifts at the hospital? Should they struggle with a freaking shovel too?\n\nOh yeah I'm a light sleeper, too. Again, that's life in a snow belt, if I were really worried about it I'd wear earplugs. Because snow plows will be out and about, too, with flashing lights and everything.\n\nAnother thing, some people come home from shift work late at night.

Snow is also fairly muffling, so I don\u2019t think it makes all that much noise.\n\nWorse comes to worse, maybe you need an electric snowblower.\n\nDuring the day sometime when it\u2019s snowing, see how loud your snowblower is from your house, and you can figure out how much it\u2019s bothering the neighbors.", "NTA.

Not a leaf blower that you could easily postpone.", "NTA: I live in Michigan and we have plows that come down our streets in middle of night and pile snow in front of driveway so the only way I'm getting out of my driveway is with the snowblower. Also everyone's windows are closed in winter so sound is buffered. Sometimes I snowblow in middle of night and then go out in morning and do it again to get out. My neighbors also do the same thing.", "100% not the asshole. You can\u2019t control the weather and need to go to work just like everyone else does.", "NAH. Your neighbors live here too, they should understand. Imo there's a vast difference between snowblowing the driveway and sidewalk for safety than, say, running your lawn mower at 5am for curb appeal only. I'd rather hear a snow blower turn on and go right back to sleep than hearing the sound of a shovel scraping against cement.

Do whatcha gotta do. Anyone who is from that area will understand.

He needed either a permanent structure over it, or some metal covers and to clear it daily. \n\nNot to mention roof collapse potential when you\u2019ve got 10ft of solid ice on an RV. \n\nWe stopped trying to help eventually because he kept saying we were \u201ckids\u201d (mid-30s) who don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about. \n\nBut I can already see his roof sagging a little, and a tree that\u2019s about to fall on him next time we get major wind. \n\nAs someone who has traveled a fair bit and lived in different climates, I\u2019m always surprised by the ignorance of people who totally ignore the advice/concerns of the locals. \n\nHopefully he takes it seriously before he wakes up to a face full of snow and a huge hole in his roof.", "Well that's not very neighborly of the church!", "The pile of snow pushed onto the space between my set of four units and the neighboring two typically starts in late November, rises to nine-ten feet during the winter, and doesn\u2019t melt until well into March. There\u2019s another similar pile on the other side of my unit, across the street, and many, many more throughout the complex, between all the other units. I\u2019m used to plows coming through at *all* hours. There are series of plows, honking as they go by, a small fleet of beeping Sno-Cats, and teams of fast-moving snowblowers from early to late \u2014 but they\u2019re all *fast*, even after a foot or more of snow, because they have a *lot* of snow to move. Three minutes and they\u2019re past my unit. I\u2019m *used* to a lot of snow.\n\nThe only \u201cattitude\u201d is towards people who don\u2019t give any consideration to people who don\u2019t live on the same schedule.", "Triple if they block the mailbox without taking it out.", "No kidding.  It's great having to tell my boss I'm going to be late to work because the snowplows have walled me in.  The roads might be clear but that doesn't help if I can't get to the road.", "Me either! From Ontario, currently in Nova Scotia, and while we haven\u2019t had significant snow in a *while* 37 years of snow plow experience has led me to believe that snow plows push as much snow as possible into your driveway end.", "Standard practice"]}
