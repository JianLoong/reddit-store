You gotta do what you gotta do to get to work. It's ridiculous to think so many here think you should resort to a shovel when you have a perfectly good snowblower. This is life in a snowbelt, and what about essential workers who work 12-16 hour shifts at the hospital? Should they struggle with a freaking shovel too?\n\nOh yeah I'm a light sleeper, too. Again, that's life in a snow belt, if I were really worried about it I'd wear earplugs. Because snow plows will be out and about, too, with flashing lights and everything.\n\nAnother thing, some people come home from shift work late at night.

I sleep through my neighbor mowing at the crack of dawn sometimes.", "Dude, NTA. I saw you said you live at the end of your street - the snow banks you talk about wouldn\u2019t even be possible to clear between the times of the plow coming through and you going to work.

Snow is also fairly muffling, so I don\u2019t think it makes all that much noise.\n\nWorse comes to worse, maybe you need an electric snowblower.\n\nDuring the day sometime when it\u2019s snowing, see how loud your snowblower is from your house, and you can figure out how much it\u2019s bothering the neighbors.", "NTA.

Not a leaf blower that you could easily postpone.", "NTA: I live in Michigan and we have plows that come down our streets in middle of night and pile snow in front of driveway so the only way I'm getting out of my driveway is with the snowblower. Also everyone's windows are closed in winter so sound is buffered. Sometimes I snowblow in middle of night and then go out in morning and do it again to get out. My neighbors also do the same thing.", "100% not the asshole. You can\u2019t control the weather and need to go to work just like everyone else does.", "NAH. Your neighbors live here too, they should understand. Imo there's a vast difference between snowblowing the driveway and sidewalk for safety than, say, running your lawn mower at 5am for curb appeal only. I'd rather hear a snow blower turn on and go right back to sleep than hearing the sound of a shovel scraping against cement.

I run my snowblower that earlier all the time. Part of being in an area with snow.", "NTA. When I was still working, I\u2019d be out between 5 and 5:30 am with my snowblower.

Do whatcha gotta do. Anyone who is from that area will understand.

Even if it did wake me, I would definitely be understanding if the person using it was doing so for work reasons.", "https://imgur.com/a/PY6IHat\n\nGlad my city has an exception specially for snowblowers \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "Because in the winter you have to blow 2-3 times a week before work. Are you suppose to just not work?", "I lived in Colorado for 4 years and somehow both neighborhoods I lived in didn't plow the damn roads. Literally the only time they plowed was when we got an actual blizzard that dumped 2 feet of snow everywhere. Your comment made me realize how much I miss the sound of snowplows out in the middle of the night in my hometown in the Midwest when it snowed.", "Me too! I also never found them that loud.", "I would be paying my neighbor to do my driveway too \ud83d\ude1d", "Snow plows generally come in the middle of the night where I am. And the loaders beep when backing up over and over\u2026.. so I think my neighbour snowblowing at 5 am wouldn\u2019t be any worry to me.", "If you want to be a great neighbor or if you know and like your neighbors give them a heads up about your 5am ploughing plans and offer to do theirs if you\u2019re able", "We used to live in a tiny village in upstate New York where it snowed October-May. Every time it snowed, my neighbor, little old Mr. Quackenbush, would put a little plow cover on his riding lawn mower and go up and down the village sidewalks. I don\u2019t miss the snow, but I miss Mr. Quackenbush!", "Right? You can't just drive over the snow and it might take hours to shovel.", "That's fair - classic internet, weighing in on a situation with no personal experience to pull from.", "If it's over 100 by 8am I doubt very much you have a need for a snowblower ever.

I really doubt your neighbors have windows open.", "Yeah you are safe. The distance and snow I doubt anyone not awake will even know.", "Oh yeah no you\u2019re completely fine. Welcome to snow life. At least if you live somewhere you get enough snow for snowblowers you usually get awesome summers.", "Honestly I can't believe the pushback you are getting.  I guess I don't know how close your houses are but I lived in duplexes and people did late at night or early in the morning and no one cared.", "Yes, so have the millions of other people who live in the midwest.   \n\nY'know what?

If you think shoveling is inconvenient before going to work, imagine how much shittier your day will be if it starts with a visit from the police and a ticket for a couple hundred bucks.", "That doesn't mean you aren't an asshole.  It just means you're an asshole who thinks he's justified.", "So \u2026 just like everyone else . We all have bills to pay , and if we don\u2019t work there\u2019s no income.

If you've lived in an area that gets snow for long enough, you know how to shovel fucking snow without hurting yourself, and you'd be smart enough just to shovel enough to get your vehicle out.\n\nAlso edited to add, the snow plow only lasts MAYBE 30 seconds as it drives by your house, on the street, not 5+ minutes right outside your windows.", "That doesn't mean you aren't an asshole.

It sucks .. sounds like you\u2019re just making excuses to justify your actions.", "Here's a thought. Talk to your neighbors and let them know what is going on. They may actually be more accommodating if you talk to them first instead of just starting up the snowblower.

YES , other people also have to shovel their driveway when it snows .", "I live on a corner lot, which means the plow usually leaves a snowbank that at least 2ft high and 3ft wide.

It\u2019s wonderful beeping. \n\nThe rural plows lift at the driveway so no berm. We are lucky. By lucky I mean we had 18 snow days in our school division last winter.", "I'm in the same boat, the snow plow ALWAYS dumps their load at the end of my driveway.
