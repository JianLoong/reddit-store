Unfortunately, I was too quiet and polite, so many members made fun of my quietness. I didn't expect that the members would be loud, obnoxious, and extroverted. The seniors would yell at me, like \"why I wouldn't answer their questions and stay silent\" and others would join the bullying everyday. Also I was constantly ignored by my team members who would continuously exclude me from formal meetings to casual hangouts. I eventually left the organization in only 1 year. Even in graduation day, many of them would still catcall, sneer and give me hate looks. \n\n So here are my worst four bullies. The first one, Annie, would catcall me names when I am walking in the school corridors in front of many students publicly, such as \"freak\" and \"idiot\". even worse, after schooI I would have to memorize several corridor pathways so that I don't have to meet her. I also have another three, Hannah, Clare, and Samantha. Hannah would stay silent when I am being catcalled and just ignore me and never say hi. Clare would insist on making social hangouts in my team quietly to make sure that I am excluded and would never join their meetings. Samantha would make fake rumors about me within all members of the marching band, and make hate stares if I passed by her in school. \n\nToday, my brother is an Ivy League grad (Cornell) and is currently working at Big Tech and I am now preparing for my grad school. So some of my former bullies , recently & unexpectedly approached me. Last year, Samantha sent me a friend request on FB, however I rejected her friend request and immediately blocked her. 3 months ago, Hannah and Clare messaged me on IG, \"Hey, how are you now?\" and apologized. I replied \"Hi, I am currently preparing for my grad application to T20 Universities and the Ivies, and unfortunately I think we cannot be friends anymore. \" Hannah only read my message while Clare begged for my forgiveness, so I just said \"Hi, did you even remember that when I was bullied, you were silent?\", then I blocked them. \n\nRecently Annie sent a connection request on Linkedin. So I messaged her back, \"why are you ignoring me in high school and suddenly adding me here? \" she said that all of her actions were by mistake and unintentional. Yet, if it was by accidental mistake, why did she yell at me PUBLICLY in school corridors? So I rejected and blocked her completely. \n\nSo, AITA for rejecting apology from my HS bullies?\n\nActually, only a few of them apologize and many still avoid (not following) me on social media. Since last year, my Highschool graduating class have had reunions. I saw on Instagram that some bullies were there and smiling on pics with other non-marching band peers. Thats why I never attend the reunions, It totally hurts me", "created_utc": 1701997366, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18daq7f/aita_for_rejecting_former_high_school_bullys/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It must have opened up so many painful memories hearing from them. It\u2019s not your role to make abusers feel better. You handled it well by rejecting their apologies and keeping them out of your life. \n\nCongrats on applying to grad school! You\u2019ve clearly successfully overcome the horrible bullying of the past by doing well at college! Good luck OP!", "NTA fuck them and their fake apologies to make them feel better keep them blocked", "Incident #2: Also I had this one terrible accident where one of the seniors accused me for trying to get close to Annie, and this senior labelled me as a \"Lesbian girl\" and \"b*stard\", when actually at that time I was asking for Annie's help for a certain technical matters ( I couldn't remember what it was)", "NTA. I had to put up with high school bullying, too. You don't know these slags a thing. They're only trying to make themselves look good. Perhaps they are genuinely remorseful. Who knows? But that's their problem. You don't owe them a thing.

Yeah, the bullying is so terrible that I would cry every night after school in 2015. It left me a lot of trauma, and sometimes I can hear their catcalls and taunting in my head even when I am alone in my room.", "Thanks a lot for your reply!! when I saw their apology message, past memories of their bullying would resurface to my mind, and I could no longer handle these traumatizing events...", "Thanks a lot for the reply!! I agreed, until now I am still distancing myself from them... Yes sure, I will also try to move on gradually, as sometimes the past memories would resurface nowadays...", "Thanks a lot for your reply!! Same, I agree here", "Thanks a lot for your reply! I agree with you, and I sometimes wonder why even people like them would do horrible taunting, I don't even know how they learned to do such a thing.... Do their parents even teach them to have the right manners when socializing..??", "Thanks a lot for your reply!! I was relieved to know that I do not owe them anything... They used to demand me to apologize to them in every single marching band sessions for a reason that I do not know, perhaps it is because I was too quiet and afraid to speak up to them at that time", "I suspect he is cute as well as successful, that is what he has to do with it.", "Hey there, sorry I forgot to add regarding this in the post above because I was hurrying while typing, so actually in one incindent, my brother happened to pick me up after school in noon, and accidentally we passed by a group of the bullies in school gates while walking out. Around several days later, on the following marching band session, while I was tidying up my instruments, I can see they were standing far away behind me in the hall. Since the hall was almost empty with few people, I could hear them laughing, mentioning my name, and making fun of me for \"only having my brother to confide in and no friends to depend in the marching band,\" one of them said \"it is clear that she does not have friends here, her brother must even be an *sshole too, so she is practicing b*llshit manners from his brother\". So basically they were throwing slurs and humiliating me and my brother in their group. Other few marching band members who were around in the hall saw this, and they acted as if they did not hear and they did not help me or call out on the group of bullies. Actually they have done a lot more humiliation incidents and this is just one of them. At that time, every time I arrive home after school, I would always cry everyday because no friends would listen to me except my family.\n\nSo in summary : this group of bullies humiliated my brother too after they knew he picked me up after school, by calling him *sshole and b*llshit\n\nhopefully this clears things up. let me know if there are any questions!", "Thanks a lot for your reply, it is very good to hear that! I sometimes worried that if I was actually the \"cruel\" person for turning down their apology and avoiding them...", "Thanks a lot for your reply, I also feel the same too... The gossip they made about me is so terrible that everybody believed the gossip and avoided me, so whatever they did now will not undo the gossip they made about me...", "Hey, thanks for your reply! Yeah, actually they did not know that I would cry every night after school, and the memory would haunt me until today... In the past, they would avoid me in order to be feel proud for being accepted by their friends and they are scared to be avoided by their friends like what happened to me...", "Thanks very much for your reply!! I agree with you too, when I read their apology message, I feel a slight pressure from nowhere to accept their apology, but it was too heavy at that time to accept their apology because I am not fully healed from my trauma.", "Good point.", "I\u2019m so sorry you went through that girly. It\u2019s so, so hard for so long and I hope you\u2019re doing okay now. \ud83d\udc95 I\u2019m proud of you for standing your ground.", "First off, they didn't do anything actually awful to you in high school (yeah, everyone gets called names and ignored sometimes) and you definitely blew that out of proportion. Related to that, you're still blowing it out of proportion and being obsessed with it at 23. Move the fuck on with your life. You're not obligated to be friends with them, but being obsessed with hating them for something pretty mild that happened several years after they apologized is just nuts.", "I feel like forgiving someone who wronged u can be a great way to let go of the resentment for what happened to u. But it\u2019s not something  u need to ever tell the other person. What\u2019s more, u don\u2019t ever have to forgive them. \n\nTelling someone they\u2019re forgiven\u2014accepting an apology\u2014isn\u2019t something u do for u; u do it for them. They may feel awful but y\u2019know what? People should feel awful for doing bad things. It\u2019s not ur responsibility to relieve these folks of their guilty conscience. \n\nNTA.", "As someone who was also bullied and excluded alot in high school, IMO you owe them absolutely *nothing.*  You sound close to what I went through and I can tell you that even 25+ years after HS, those experiences still haunt me and no apology will fix it.  You're the better person for just blocking and telling them why.  Wish you the best in grad school.  NTA.\n\nEdit: I also recommend some counseling as there may be underlying damage you may not even know about.  I didn't realize for 10 to 15 years how much that treatment affected me.", "NTA. Do what feels right for you. I am currently in \"High school\". Thankfully, most people here are nice and accepting. I am also quiet.", "if the bullying still bothers you till this day, then you should allow them to apologise, even if you want to block them afterwards.\n\nmake sure you get a genuine apology and a proper explanation for their behaviour.\n\ntell them how it made you feel and ask how they are going to make up for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if you know in your heart that you can carry on life being happy having non of that, then blocking them and living you life id the best option. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nso just do what's best for you.", "It sounds like they've matured and realized how awful they were. Now they need you to forgive them so they can feel better. It's not your job to make them feel better. I'd go as far as to tell them \"I hope your child never has to go through what you put me through\".", "Thanks a lot for the reply!! Very thankful for your response. I feel quite stressed when reading the bullies' apology letter", "Yess, thanks a lot for your reply!! I still blocked them on social media until today. Sometimes I still worry though if they attempt to find another way to contact or harass me online", "Thanks very much for the reply!! Yes, I will try to move on from my trauma and memory. In college my life improved though, thankfully I meet friendlier and better people compared to my marching band experience. Apparently for my high school peers though, they still hold high school reunions ( I saw on instagram posts that around last year and early this year they had post-graduation alumni meetup and reunions ) , and I did not attend my high school reunions because my marching band bullies were there.", "Thanks very much for the reply!! I am glad to know your response. The whole experience was really traumatizing and painful to me...", "Thanks for your answer!! Same, I agree here, I sometimes have the gut feeling that they are apologizing just because they knew (through social media) that my brother went to an Ivy League School and I am applying for a grad school. (Yes , they knew my brother's full name so they can see him on social media.) \n\nIf only the current situation is different for me , i.e. I became poor and sick, I somehow know that the bullies would never come and apologize to me. Because I remember that when I was bullied, cried alone, and had no friends in the marching band in high school, nobody would come to me and comfort me. Instead , everyone avoided me as if I were a parasite to them, because they are afraid if they get bullied too for befriending me.\n\nIt is a very painful reminder to me that, when I have nothing, the marching band members would still laugh and mock me. But if I somehow became \"rich\" or \"famous\" (by their 'standards') in one night, then they would come to me and apologize to me. they only saw my outer achievements and \"status\" but They never understood: how I needed friends desperately because I am constantly not getting hang out invitations, and how I worked hard while having to hold my trauma and pain.\n\n Well, that is why I never attended my high school reunions until now because some of my bullies attend them. It hurts to see on instagram how these bullies are still smiling in the reunion pics.", "Thanks very much for your reply!! I am very relieved and happy to hear that. I am still currently trying to move on from the past events", "Thanks a lot for your reply!! I agreed and I feel that too, whenever I see their face or social media profiles I would remember their past actions, so I would avoid looking up their social media profiles.", "Thanks very much for your reply! I agreed, same here, I still had no contact with them. I would still remember when they avoided me and intentionally not inviting me to any activities.", "Thanks very much for your reply!! Also, I am sorry to hear that you had to deal with school bullying too. I am also here to support you as well, because I know what it feels to experience high school bullying. \n\nI agree, I also feel the same as you, I sometimes think that If only they are truly remorseful, then why did they not apologize to us earlier when we were still in high school? why did it have to take years and so long for them to apologize? \n\nAlso, I believe bullying has to be stopped. in my bullying case, I learned that some people would do bullying in order to gain acceptance and approval from their group of friends, to raise their \" social ranking\" and to retain their popularity by sacrificing others' mental state. I believe this kind of bullying has to be stopped as it is not a right thing to do to bully on one target person and damage his / her mental state. I also read news and, I learned that the bullying victim would end up committing suicide because the bullying was too horrible, and this makes me very sad. \n\nAlso, its good for you to ignore the school bully's facebook request. \n\nAlso thanks a lot for your advice, and you too, you are amazing and be the awesome person you are!", "Hey there thanks for your reply! Yes, I agree with you. I feel relieved and glad after reading your reply. \n\nBack in the past I used to apologize politely to them for every single 'mistake' I did to them, even when I did nothing wrong, but I realized that I should have been more assertive towards them and stood up for myself instead of submitting to them when I did nothing wrong. \n\nI also sometimes think that the action of bullying can never be undone. It sometimes make me sad whenever I read similar stories of bullying victims who committed suicide because they have nobody to support them. I hope that bullying can be stopped so that nobody would suffer from pain and trauma.", "Hey there, thanks for your reply! I am also sorry to hear that you also experienced bullying, and I also support you and I am on your side. Yes, I also experienced exactly similar to yours, my bullying experience still haunts me until today. I would sometimes even get nightmares about them when sleeping. \n\nThanks very much for your wishes. Also I wish success and all the best for your life and your future. I hope everything in your life is going well for you too! \n\nThanks a lot for your advice too! Yeah I have been considering some kind of PTSD therapy and counseling, so that I can find ways to cope whenever I am encountering PTSD episodes.", "Hey there, thanks a lot for your reply! I am glad to hear your advice. Same here, I am also a quiet person. \n\n I am also happy to hear that the people in your high school are accepting and kind. I hope your high school is going well too for you! I also hope that in other schools, more students will be more accepting and stop bullying behavior. \n\n\nI also wish you all the best & success for your high school!", "Hey there, thanks a lot for your reply! Yes, I agree with you, I still feel hurt after what they had done to me, so I am still avoiding them currently on social media. I still have PTSD episodes and bad memories that would resurface whenever I saw their social media profiles or I saw their pictures online. \n\nAlso yes, i also at that time was still not ready to face their apology because I am still dealing with depression and traumatic feelings. \n\nAlso thanks very much for your advice, I will try to move on and live a happy life!", "Hey thanks very much for your advice too! Yes, I agree, until now I was still undergoing trauma and terrible memories due to my past experience. Until my high school graduation, actually I never reported to the high school teachers or principal because I am scared that the bullying will be even worse if I happened to report to the school officials. So at that time I had to deal with the bullying all by myself. \n\nI also agree with you, I also hope that bullying ( either verbally or physical ) can be stopped completely, so that nobody will have to suffer mentally anymore. I sometimes read on news about a bullying victim who committed suicide because [they were a loner](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/31/us/new-jersey-school-bullying-suicide-settlement/index.html) or [being LGBT](https://www.witf.org/2023/02/22/gay-teen-killed-himself-after-endless-bullying-at-central-pa-school-moms-lawsuit/) in school, and this makes me very sad. I also really hope for the victim's families to be strong and comforted after the loss of their child after the suicide incindent.", "Thanks very much for your reply!! I agree with you, yes even when not reading their message when being alone I would remember their yellings and tauntings. \n\nAlso thank you a lot for the supportive comment! I also wish you success and all the best for your future and I hope you have a prosperous journey ahead too! \n\nI would still remember studying hard in college and handling ptsd episodes, but now I am trying to move on off the trauma gradually.", "Off-topic, but I suddenly remembered a plot of a horror movie where a bullies have to go around seeking apology from their previous victim, or they will end up dead lol", "I was brutally verbally bullied jr and hs and I'm almost 60 and never want to be near those who did it", "\\*Sending cyberhug\\*", "I too was bullied at school. I was abused and neglected at home so it made me meek. Perfect fodder for the bullies. I'm in my 60's now and sometimes it still haunts me.. I raised my kids to never tolerate that sort of thing and they got in trouble a few times for standing up for themselves or defending someone who was being bullied. I never punished them for it even when the school did especially if they were defending someone. I REWARDED them.", "* sending you a big Cyber hug * (\u2741\u00b4\u25e1`\u2741)"]}
