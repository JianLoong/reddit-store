The seniors would yell at me, like \"why I wouldn't answer their questions and stay silent\" and others would join the bullying everyday.

Even in graduation day, many of them would still catcall, sneer and give me hate looks. \n\n So here are my worst four bullies. The first one, Annie, would catcall me names when I am walking in the school corridors in front of many students publicly, such as \"freak\" and \"idiot\". even worse, after schooI I would have to memorize several corridor pathways so that I don't have to meet her. I also have another three, Hannah, Clare, and Samantha. Hannah would stay silent when I am being catcalled and just ignore me and never say hi. Clare would insist on making social hangouts in my team quietly to make sure that I am excluded and would never join their meetings. Samantha would make fake rumors about me within all members of the marching band, and make hate stares if I passed by her in school. \n\nToday, my brother is an Ivy League grad (Cornell) and is currently working at Big Tech and I am now preparing for my grad school.

I replied \"Hi, I am currently preparing for my grad application to T20 Universities and the Ivies, and unfortunately I think we cannot be friends anymore. \" Hannah only read my message while Clare begged for my forgiveness, so I just said \"Hi, did you even remember that when I was bullied, you were silent?\", then I blocked them. \n\nRecently Annie sent a connection request on Linkedin. So I messaged her back, \"why are you ignoring me in high school and suddenly adding me here? \" she said that all of her actions were by mistake and unintentional.

It must have opened up so many painful memories hearing from them. It\u2019s not your role to make abusers feel better. You handled it well by rejecting their apologies and keeping them out of your life. \n\nCongrats on applying to grad school! You\u2019ve clearly successfully overcome the horrible bullying of the past by doing well at college! Good luck OP!", "NTA fuck them and their fake apologies to make them feel better keep them blocked", "Incident #2: Also I had this one terrible accident where one of the seniors accused me for trying to get close to Annie, and this senior labelled me as a \"Lesbian girl\" and \"b*stard\", when actually at that time I was asking for Annie's help for a certain technical matters ( I couldn't remember what it was)", "NTA. I had to put up with high school bullying, too. You don't know these slags a thing. They're only trying to make themselves look good. Perhaps they are genuinely remorseful. Who knows? But that's their problem. You don't owe them a thing. '\n\nI got a FB request from a school bully and just ignored it, too. \n\nJust focus on you and being the nice cool person you clearly are.", "Thanks very much for your advice!! Yeah, the bullying is so terrible that I would cry every night after school in 2015. It left me a lot of trauma, and sometimes I can hear their catcalls and taunting in my head even when I am alone in my room.", "Thanks a lot for your reply!! when I saw their apology message, past memories of their bullying would resurface to my mind, and I could no longer handle these traumatizing events...", "Thanks a lot for the reply!! I agreed, until now I am still distancing myself from them... Yes sure, I will also try to move on gradually, as sometimes the past memories would resurface nowadays...", "Thanks a lot for your reply!! Same, I agree here", "Thanks a lot for your reply! I agree with you, and I sometimes wonder why even people like them would do horrible taunting, I don't even know how they learned to do such a thing.... Do their parents even teach them to have the right manners when socializing..??", "Thanks a lot for your reply!! I was relieved to know that I do not owe them anything... They used to demand me to apologize to them in every single marching band sessions for a reason that I do not know, perhaps it is because I was too quiet and afraid to speak up to them at that time", "I suspect he is cute as well as successful, that is what he has to do with it.", "Hey there, sorry I forgot to add regarding this in the post above because I was hurrying while typing, so actually in one incindent, my brother happened to pick me up after school in noon, and accidentally we passed by a group of the bullies in school gates while walking out. Around several days later, on the following marching band session, while I was tidying up my instruments, I can see they were standing far away behind me in the hall. Since the hall was almost empty with few people, I could hear them laughing, mentioning my name, and making fun of me for \"only having my brother to confide in and no friends to depend in the marching band,\" one of them said \"it is clear that she does not have friends here, her brother must even be an *sshole too, so she is practicing b*llshit manners from his brother\". So basically they were throwing slurs and humiliating me and my brother in their group. Other few marching band members who were around in the hall saw this, and they acted as if they did not hear and they did not help me or call out on the group of bullies. Actually they have done a lot more humiliation incidents and this is just one of them. At that time, every time I arrive home after school, I would always cry everyday because no friends would listen to me except my family.\n\nSo in summary : this group of bullies humiliated my brother too after they knew he picked me up after school, by calling him *sshole and b*llshit\n\nhopefully this clears things up. let me know if there are any questions!", "Thanks a lot for your reply, it is very good to hear that! I sometimes worried that if I was actually the \"cruel\" person for turning down their apology and avoiding them...", "Thanks a lot for your reply, I also feel the same too... The gossip they made about me is so terrible that everybody believed the gossip and avoided me, so whatever they did now will not undo the gossip they made about me...", "Hey, thanks for your reply! Yeah, actually they did not know that I would cry every night after school, and the memory would haunt me until today... In the past, they would avoid me in order to be feel proud for being accepted by their friends and they are scared to be avoided by their friends like what happened to me...", "Thanks very much for your reply!! I agree with you too, when I read their apology message, I feel a slight pressure from nowhere to accept their apology, but it was too heavy at that time to accept their apology because I am not fully healed from my trauma.", "Good point.", "I\u2019m so sorry you went through that girly. It\u2019s so, so hard for so long and I hope you\u2019re doing okay now. \ud83d\udc95 I\u2019m proud of you for standing your ground."]}
