Your mother, especially owes you an apology. What she did not only drove a wedge between you and your sister, but it was incredibly vicious and unkind. Seems to me like you might not need either of them in your life. If you feel like doing this, you could post online exactly why you didn\u2019t invite them and give the example you gave above and a couple more. Let your mothers friends and family know how badly she\u2019s treated you.", "NTA - makes me think of my wife & her sister: on sister's 30th her parents got a private room at a restaurant, invited people, gave her a nice pearl necklace, and so on ... for my wife's 30th she got a check for $30. \n\nNot surprisingly she is now NC with both.", "NTA and DO NOT apologize.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but you said they showed up at your home and demanded to know why they weren\u2019t invited to your birthday party knowing they wouldn\u2019t show up?! \n\nBased on your post, it seems the rest of your family is aware of how you continue to be treated by your mother and your sister. Cut them out of your life, you\u2019ll be better off for doing so.", "You're NTA. Block all their harassing friends and consider no contact with your mother and sister.", "It sounds like an abusive relationship with both mother and sister. Good thing is - you do not live together and you can choose to go low- or even no contact with them. Might be for the best to cut them off, it does not sound like they will change their ways. I'm sorry for you OP, but family is the one you make. Hopefully you have better people in your life to focus on. NTA", "NTA. Your mother and sister seem to have their own little world where each supports the delusional behaviour of the other. \n\nWhen confronted with how the accumulated accounts of them leaving you out led to you not inviting them anymore (first solid confrontation about it maybe) they immediately freaked out and switched to being defensive in a way as would be expected from somebody who will complain about such a situation on social media.", "NTA. Had you invited them, the spotlight would have been on your sister instead of her. They sound horrible and you should limit contact with them.", "NTA", "NTA. Recommend LC/NC. Enjoy your life", "NTA, don't apologise. Also make sure you ghost them so that you don't have such people in your life.", "NTA block everyone who annoy you about that, and your sister is 7 not 27 it seems.", "NTA.   \nYour mother is the AH for creating what seems to be more than 20 years of deliberate manipulative division between you and your sister, robbing you both of a healthy relationship. It\u2019s hard to blame your sister when her whole life her mother has influenced her, but she\u2019s an AH too for not recognising the difference and working with you to close the gap. (Not wildly hard, by 27 she should have closed this gap.)   \nI\u2019d be a fan of creating a lot of distance from these people.", "You are perfectly capable of living your life well without those negative people in your life. \n\nSo go NC or LC and enjoy your life.\n\nNTA obviously.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nDon't apologise, go NC and cut your toxic family out of your life. You don't need people like that in your life.", "Nta", "NTA.    I hate when people air their grievances  on social media.  \nNo, you don't owe anyone  an apology", "NTA f those b\\*tches! They are manipulating you and I am glad you made your sister cry. She sounds like she needs a swift kick in the ass and it sounds like you need to go no contact with both of them. Sorry this happened to you :( Moms and sisters can be really cruel- often they are jealous of their child/sibling. Are you smarter than your sister or more successful? Something to consider. Good luck!", "NTA you know the friends don\u2019t have the whole story and even if they did, they might not take your side out of loyalty. More generally, you weren\u2019t the one who picked that fight. You had your own birthday party - you didn\u2019t call and demand money and attention and get angry that your mom didn\u2019t care. You just handled it knowing she wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s them who pushed for conflict and wouldn\u2019t have left happy unless you\u2019d subjugated yourself and apologized for being \u201cbad\u201d.", "Why are their friends getting involved.

What the fuck.", "NTA and I want you to think about what an apology means\ufffc.\n\nPeople usually apologize for one of two reasons:\n\n1.They feel genuine remorse and they want to heal the relationship.\n\nor 2. They just want the conflict to go away so that everything can go back to normal.\ufffc\n\nDo you want your relationship with your mom and sister to go back to normal? Do you think healing is possible? \n\nIf the answer to both of those is no, think long and hard about what kind of relationship you do want with them.

If OP even feels the need to verify that she\u2019s NTA, then they have already gotten under her skin too much.", "Bc she already communicated with them directly and then they sent their flying monkeys after her.", "You could ask that under any AITA thread. I'm willing to bet these sorry excuses for a mother and a sister are not exactly receptive to feedback, while being dismissive of OP and her feelings. This is not a good basis for dialogue. If anything, trying to talk to people like that hurts more than it helps. If it was me, I'd just tell them to fk off and go NC.", "So? She doesn't have to stoop to their level?", "Right now \u201ctheir level\u201d is telling one side of a story and sending friends to harass her. Posting her side publicly is not their level. \n\nCommunicating directly resulted in them sending flying monkeys, besides posting publicly the only solution would be to just ignore it all. Which considering she wasn\u2019t the one who started all this (they\u2019re the ones who came looking for an answer/argument), seems like she\u2019d be doing a lot of blocking of random numbers."]}
