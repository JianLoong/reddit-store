How is your relationship with her?\n\nI don't think your are an AH, but this is a very delicate situation. Suing her may get some of your money back, but it also ruin your relationship. You could try to settle a agreement with her instead of suing, but don't know how she is as a person", "NTA. \n\nyou don't want to sue, because she's your mother...BUT- she didn't have any problem stealing from you and lying to you about it. she must not think much of you being her daughter.\n\nsue. and cut ALL ties with her. she's NOT a mother to you. she's pure evil.", "QUESTION- how long does the benefit last..? until both you &your mother die, or is there a cut-off date? \n\nsueing will get you the money you deserve going forward, at the very least. but- if you'd rather it go to your aunts uncles and cousins, who probably weren't close to your dad- that's definitely your prerogative. but probably not what he wanted. or intended.", "Sue, sue, sue!

You are entitled to nothing but the minimum basics: food to not starve, clothes to not catch infection or frostbite, school supplies, a roof over your head, a relationship with family and peers that teaches you self-confidence and self-respect. If your parents have voluntarily given you a lower standard of living, that is their right and prerogative as the guardians for your balanced education. $8000 a month in income is an absurd amount of money by my standards, even today.", "Definitely NTA . It sounds like, unfortunately,  you do not have a good relationship with your mother so you won't be losing anything if you sue her as she is emotionally abusing you. You can have a very good start in life with the money your father left for you. I think sueing her would benefit you.  I am sorry she treats you so poorly. Now that you are an adult you can choose to make a new positive family amongst your friends. A family that builds you up instead of tearing you down. Good luck to you.", "Nta. From reading all your responses, it seems like you just need a nudge to sue her. Do it. Burn the bridge. Shes treating you like shiet anyways.

Also, don't blame your mother's decisions in the past if you have some setbacks in the future because it won't help you.\n\nI'll go with NTA.", "Suing her would cost you money and time and be a drain on everyone's emotion. If you contact the organization that sends out the pension, and tell them that you want your share sent to your bank account, you can probably do that over the phone or by sending a letter and your mom won't even find out until the money stops flowing in.", "I never mentioned that to her but every time I try to communicate about my part of the pension she tells me things like what are you going to do?

She is your mother and lied to you for years, that's not okay.", "Why would OP want a relationship with a mother who knowingly deceives and steals from their child. I would never speak to a parent after something like this and sue just to be petty.", "The mother has never been concerned with ruining the relationship with OP.  She\u2019s literally been stealing from her!  This isn\u2019t a relationship worth keeping.", "It's not on you if she kills herself.  It's on her.  I doubt she'll do it anyways.  My mother-in-law threatened to kill herself if my husband married me.  She expected to arrange his marriage which means she knows absolutely nothing about him.\n\nGuess what? More than 20 years late she's still alive and we're still married.", "That answer alone is enough to tell me you should probably sue", "Her actions are not your responsibility.  If you sued her. What she then does is up to her.", "Let this play out.  Actions have consequences in real life.  Time she learns."]}
