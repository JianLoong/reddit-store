I (28F) and my sister (19F) have moved away from our hometown, but we always get everyone together on Christmas Day.\n\nThis year, I will be traveling 6,000 miles to get home for Christmas, after working abroad for the last 6 months. My dad just informed me that he is choosing not to come and won't see my sister and I on Christmas day, unless we drive an additional 5 hours to his GF's apartment.\n\nWe previously ruled out spending the holiday there, because the GF\u2019s apartment is a hoarder\u2019s paradise in the middle of nowhere, and it would prevent us from seeing the rest of our family (grandparents, cousins, etc.)\n\nMy solution was to rent a 4-bedroom AirBnB in my hometown, and to invite my dad and his GF to stay with us, so that we could all be together and near the rest of our family (the GF's extended family also lives in the same town). \n\nMy dad agreed to that plan... up until now. Of course, the AirBnB (which is much larger than anything I would rent for just my sister and I) is nonrefundable, which puts me in another difficult situation. \n\nFor context, my parents divorced four years ago, and my sister and I have had a strained relationship with our mom ever since. Our dad jumped right back into dating, and two weeks after moving my sister to college, he announced he was selling our family home and moving 5 hours away to live with his GF, after one year of dating. (They had been planning it for months, and I was only notified once the house I grew up in was under contract). \n\nThe GF has consistently been controlling and manipulative, and when my dad is with her, it feels like he's a different person. She has completely isolated him from his family and friends. She doesn't attempt to have a relationship with my sister or I, and when we're all together, she ignores us and only talks to our dad.\n\nWhen it came to Christmas last year, I invited everyone to Washington, DC, because that's where I was working, and we no longer had our family home... so I was trying to make the best of the situation. They came, and my dad's GF spent the entire 48 hours there being passive. aggressive. about. everything. She had the worst attitude, and it made the trip miserable for everyone. \n\nMy dad is now claiming he promised his GF that he would spend this Christmas at her apartment, because she traveled to see us last year. However, he didn't communicate any of that to me until just now and let me plan the entire holiday and rent a house, thinking that he and the GF would be there. \n\nThe GF also has a daughter (24F), who always chooses to spend the holidays with her boyfriend of the moment. Well, she just got dumped and now wants to spend Christmas with her mom\u2026 so my dad is suddenly rewriting history and acting like they never agreed to our original plan (after I paid for everything).\n\nSo, AITA for expecting my dad to stick to the commitment he made, instead of choosing his awful GF over HIS own daughters?", "created_utc": 1670316115, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze0rbo/aita_for_refusing_to_travel_5_hours_to_my_dads/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, your dad won't stick to the commitment, so forget about making him abide by it. He has shown that he will prioritise his girlfriend over you -- it's not right, but that's how it is, and you won't be able to change it. Are there other family members travelling back who'd want to stay in the AirBNB with you and your sister? Or who would want to spend a bit more time with you and stay over?", "First of all, NTA - stick to your guns. Stay in town and see the rest of your relatives and have a damn good time!\n\nSecondly, if you haven't already got your father's share (+GF's) of the rental cost, try and get it now since, as you pointed out, you'd have hired smaller for just you and your sister. But I doubt he'll pay up now if he hasn't already. In which case,...\n\nThirdly, tell him you eating the cost is his Xmas and birthday present for the next x years.\n\nFourthly, ask around any other relatives - either also flying in or squidged in with extra bodies staying, and see if you can get even half the missing amount by offering peace and quiet to retreat to (lol)!\n\nI'm really sorry your father is behaving so uncaringly. What is it about divorced parents desperately clutching for love from nasty controlling partners by damaging existing relationships with their kids...?\n\nI hope he comes to his senses and drives the 5 hours to be with his family, and leaves his GF and her daughter behind. If he doesn't, he's the one missing out. Enjoy seeing those who joyfully DO want to spend time with you, and book therapy sessions for the new year to cope with him next year.", "NTA. Leave your dad & his toxic GF to enjoy their squalid dump - a pleasing 5 hours away - & look forward to spending Christmas with people you love & who won\u2019t spend their time being assholes. Have fun! \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84", "NTA, but the dad you knew is probably gone and your expectations are out of whack.  They will never be fulfilled.  Accept this.  He will choose the Gf over you every time.  That should be your expectation.  Never invite him again and if he cries about not being invited, tell him he lost that privilege.  If he really wanted to see you, he would make it happen.  I'm so sorry, you definitely deserve better than this.", "NTA.  Dad is the asshole.  Maybe in the future you will consider letting dad wallow in the joy of a hoarder's paradise.", "NTA- Spend time with the people in your family who want to spend time with you. Tell your father that you have already paid for the AirB&B, and you will be spending time with your whole family. He is welcome to come, but you and your sister will not be going an extra 5 hours to have Christmas with a woman who does not seem to like you in an apartment full of garbage.", "NTA and cut full contact with him. Clearly he doesn't care about his past life as father and husband. It even sounds like he never was really happy in his old life.", "NTA. Stick to the plan you made but don't worry if he decides not to turn up.", "NTA enjoy Christmas With your sister and the rest of your familly", "Nta just enjoy your holiday.", "NTA. Please enjoy the holiday the best that you can, knowing that you did made the most helpful, gracious plans you could. I\u2019m so sorry that your Dad doesn\u2019t appreciate your travel and expense. Any chance he\u2019d visit on a different day you\u2019re there? Breaking tradition is disappointing, but I hope you find some joy with the rest of your family.    Maybe it\u2019s a good year to try one new holiday experience or celebration to start a new tradition. \n\nMiddle age men don\u2019t always make the best decisions. Some find it hard to come to grips with their identity in that stage. It\u2019s about him and how his GF makes him feel, separate from his love for you.", "NTA because your dad made a commitment that cost you money and is now trying to gaslight you over it.  However, I think you need to accept that his priorities have changed and you and your family are no longer high on that list.  He gets to choose where he goes for the holidays, but you get to choose not to bother putting forth this kind of effort in the future.  Since the rental is already spent funds, you might offer it to anyone else in the family who could use it and just let your dad do his own thing going forward.  I certainly wouldn't worry about spending anything on presents for him or GF since you're out so much over this mess.", "NTA you all agreed made plans. Tell him they are still welcome to come but you and sister will not be traveling to GF house. Maybe someone else in family could come stay with you? Out of town cousins who also are home visiting. Not a lot you can do about dad and his GF.", "NTA. As you grow older, you start new traditions and make adjustments for new relationships. Your father can't make it, that's disappointing, but you get to skip his girlfriend's passive aggression which is a Christmas miracle! You'll be in your hometown seeing other relatives and he'll be welcome to drop in anytime.\n\nIf the airbnb is truly non-refundable, don't worry about it, the money is already spent. Maybe invite other family to spend the night, I'm sure there's someone who would like break from the crowd for a night.", "NTA.\n\nRealise one thing, you can demand and expect him to stick to the commitment but I doubt he will honour it.\n\nGo to the AirB&B with your sister, tell your father that he and the GF are welcome but stay firm in not going to her place. Have a good time with your sister and other loved ones  nonetheless.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
