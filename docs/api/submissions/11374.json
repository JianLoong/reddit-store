Well it turns out one of the main reasons for that is that if you get enough \u201chearts\u201d with them you can marry them and they\u2019ll come help you on your farm\u2014as I discovered when all these little pixelated characters started coming on to me!!\n\nSometimes I play on our TV instead of handheld if my boyfriend is doing something else or isn\u2019t in the mood to watch a show.

But then the most recent time I played I hit one of these \u201cromantic\u201d (seriously not really) cut scenes. And when he asked about it I happily gabbed away how everyone in town suddenly wants my farmer\u2019s booty now that I\u2019ve figured out how to make money, when they could have cared less about me as a dirty broke newcomer!
