It has an element to it where if you give presents to the local townspeople, you can befriend them. Well it turns out one of the main reasons for that is that if you get enough \u201chearts\u201d with them you can marry them and they\u2019ll come help you on your farm\u2014as I discovered when all these little pixelated characters started coming on to me!!\n\nSometimes I play on our TV instead of handheld if my boyfriend is doing something else or isn\u2019t in the mood to watch a show. He\u2019s been interested in my farming and we\u2019ve laughed together about the antics I get up to fishing and mining in the game. But then the most recent time I played I hit one of these \u201cromantic\u201d (seriously not really) cut scenes. And when he asked about it I happily gabbed away how everyone in town suddenly wants my farmer\u2019s booty now that I\u2019ve figured out how to make money, when they could have cared less about me as a dirty broke newcomer! I think that whole aspect of the game is totally hilarious, it\u2019s like the Bachelorette. And I thought he would think so too!\n\nBut instead he just said \u201cwow\u201d and was quiet for the rest of the evening. And when it was time to go to bed, he laid down on the couch! I still hardly had any idea that he was upset and asked if his back hurt or something. He said \u201cIs that really what you think?\u201d then asked me how I could possibly think that he wouldn\u2019t be bothered by me \u201cplaying a flirting game where I have multiple boyfriends and girlfriends\u201d right in front of him. He thought it was very disrespectful! Um\u2026 what the heck. I really thought it was pretty sweet and innocent! And it\u2019s a very small element of the game.
