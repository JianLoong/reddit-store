At the ceremony my disabled husband was stuck standing in the back for nearly 2 hours, and he had to keep opening the door because MofBride had told all church she had forgot to send some invitations and it was at 1, when it was at 11. People kept showing up and leaving upset because they\u2019d missed it. My in-laws almost missed it, but we had called before and she was shocked, but had 40 minutes to get ready.  It was standing room, with me and my younger child on the narrow old stairs with some elderly people clearly in pain, because my friend and the bride chose the smallest building for the ceremony. Then we walked in to the potluck reception and found out our family was assigned seats 3 separate tables on opposite sides of the hall, our middle children were seated alone with strangers, and my in-laws weren\u2019t listed. My friend and her daughter the bride had made a big deal about families and all children being welcomed, but none of the families were seated together. My children and disabled husband were both having anxiety about being with strangers so we left. I saw another friend who had helped set up and explained why we were leaving, she offered to go around to move people for us, but I said that wouldn\u2019t be right to make a scene as other families were separated too, and there were no seats for a lot of the church parishioners, that it was too late because my husband and child were already upset.

A kids table is one thing, but seating random children with random adults they've never met and vice versa already tells you that the rest of the wedding was going to be as disorganized as the ceremony. Also, you didn't cause any scene, so if the bride or groom or anyone else try to come after you for leaving early, just remind them that this was their doing and theirs alone."]}
