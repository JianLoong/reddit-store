If the convention is happening during peak season or another event, it's more than likely to happen", "I'm a dumb mother fucker and I figured out Salesforce in like a month. \n\nI'm GenX. If we wanted to do anything cool on the intertubes when we were young we had to figure out how to code it or get around whatever dumb shit was in our way.\n\nA Salesforce dashboard is basically remedial Excel for people who sell shit but never took algebra.", "Oh yeah, it's dead simple. Which is why they spend 1/3 of the company budget revising it every year. I once worked at a 30 person company that was 15 Salesforce developers. The only thing they did every day was have endless meetings, one after the other. None had time to do any work. And the company made money (in spite of them) which they spun as being proof they were crucial. I was the only one to question what it was they did and why we wasted so much money on a platform that was already done and needed like 1 report or page changed a month", "It\u2019s not appearance based. The subway stations in the Bay Area are filled with drug addicts. I know because I lived there for two years. \n\nBut with that said, the streets around the sales force convention is also filled with drug addicts.", "$1700 a night? Jeez, I should rent out my 5-stops-to-Montgomery house in the Castro and sleep downstairs.", "ESH obviously we all know why co-worker is asshole but you are inserting yourself in his business after he has told you to stop. You offered to look up cancelation policy and it upset him. He rudely told you to leave him alone and didn't engage with you for 3 days. You then \"confronted\" him about it and get upset when he again rudely tells you to leave him alone. I know you have good intentions but just do your job, worry about you, and let him be a big boy and handle this on his own.", "But that wouldn't make any sense either. If OP would hand in the cost of 2 rooms and then the coworker handed in one of his own, questions will immediately get raised by whoever does their accounting.", "I'm a software engineer, and a long time back I worked at a small company where my first day the founder/CEO took the phone from his desk, put it on mine, and said \"you can answer the phone calls\".  Professional coding usually takes long period of uninterrupted time, plus I'm real awkward on the phone or in person (one of the reasons I chose to work with computers over people...)  And there \\*were\\* other engineers (all male) but they had never been told to answer the phone. Eventually he took the phone away after I'd been complaining for months, but only because I was so bad at it we were losing sales.  I quit after 5 months for that, and many more reasons.", "Likely the company gave them a budget for lodging that they were not to exceed and when Mr. Incompetent tried to submit his $4000 receipt he was told he would be on the hook for the difference or that his lodgings were not approved.", "Based on his pattern of behavior, I don't think coworker is the sharpest tool in the shed.", "...gonna go out on a limb and posit that the issue is not the delay, it's the potential of getting stabbed by a drug addict.", "All of downtown Indianapolis was sold out within **two hours** of the hotel portal opening this year. Yes, it can happen for a large conference in a large city.", "If this isn\u2019t the cold hard truth lmao.\n\nGod, I\u2019ve never been so annoyed by anyone as much as Salesforce - on both a company and individual associate level.\n\nGranted there\u2019s another company that is currently pushing very hard to oust them on my scale but tbh with them I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the company or just the poor stupid souls I have to personally deal with.  \n\nLiterally had one guy question why we put a zero on a line and and we were like, \u201c\u2026because we received zero?\u201d  And then it took another follow up phone call to explain it again to the point I was ready to scream."]}
