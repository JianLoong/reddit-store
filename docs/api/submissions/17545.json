When I got into work, he was visibly upset. He showed me a printed invoice for a hotel room that he had booked on a third-party travel site that added up to $4,000 and was non-refundable (the discounted price I paid was around $1800). In addition, he had the conference website open and was complaining that the link to the discounted hotel rate was not visible.\n\nI was in shock as this coworker prides himself on being the least impulsive/fiscally responsible person in the office. I didn\u2019t want to upset him further so I offered to help him look up the cancellation policies for the booking company.

He angrily replied, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to help me to get my $4,000 back, we have nothing to talk about.\u201d I was in disbelief as it sounded like he is blaming me for his actions.
