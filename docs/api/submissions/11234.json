I feel like I might have been in the wrong, but I want to hear what others think.\n\nSo, my husband (57M) and I had planned a family trip to Tahiti to celebrate our upcoming wedding anniversary. We had invited our two adult children, Lisa (30F) and Mark (32M), to join us on the trip. However, there was an issue with Lisa, who is currently six months pregnant with her first child. Lisa decided to pay extra to upgrade her airline ticket to business class to ensure she had a more comfortable journey, given her pregnancy.\n\nInitially, I didn't see anything wrong with this, but then I realized that Lisa's decision was unfair to everyone else in the family who was sitting in coach. My husband and I were sitting in coach, and so was my son Mark. Lisa upgrading to business class meant that she was getting preferential treatment that was not available to the rest of us. I thought this was very selfish of her.\n\nSo, I confronted Lisa about this issue and told her that if she wanted to come on the trip, she would have to downgrade her ticket back to coach. Lisa was understandably upset about this and argued that she had paid for her ticket and should be allowed to travel in the class of her choice. However, I stood my ground and insisted that she had to downgrade her ticket.\n\nNow, Lisa is very upset with me and has been telling our extended family and friends about what happened. Some of them have been telling me that I was wrong to force her to downgrade her ticket, while others have been telling Lisa that she was being selfish.\n\nSo, Reddit, I want to know, am I the asshole for making my pregnant daughter sit in coach on our long-haul flight to Tahiti? Should I have let her keep her business class ticket? I'm feeling very conflicted about this and would appreciate your honest opinions.\n\nJust to clarify, Lisa's husband, John (32M), was not coming on the trip with us.", "created_utc": 1677708904, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fjwlu/aita_for_making_my_pregnant_daughter_sit_in_coach/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She paid for her ticket with HER money. How she flies using her money is HER choice. What exactly is your problem?\n\n\n2. If I were Lisa, I'd have just cancelled that trip altogether. \n\n\n3. Since you are a woman who has given birth, I expect that you know the discomforts that come with pregnancy. Have you forgotten all that? Of course you have. Because if you hadn't, you wouldn't have berated your pregnant daughter for wanting to travel comfortably using her own money.\n\n4. I'm guessing you'd  have been extremely happy had she paid to upgrade ALL YOUR TICKETS?", "YTA, you should be happy that she is coming in the first place.", "Is your daughter an adult or not?

She's paying for this herself.

Went on a family trip to Japan and I flew business class for the 14 hour flight because I could afford it. My brother flew economy because he couldn't. Do you know what he said to me about it?\n\nNOTHING, because he's an adult who understands that you get what you pay for.", "YTA. And very disgusting as well. I hope your daughter cuts you out of her life.", "From the title, I imagined some kind of Home Alone situation where you were in 1st and she was in economy. But as she wanted to pay to upgrade herself because she is pregnant, clearly YTA.", "YTA", "Yta. She paid extra to make sure she was comfortable while pregnant. You all could have upgraded also, it would just cost money. Demanding she make her self more uncomfortable than she already is just seems unnecessary and frankly, mean", "I'm so confused about your priorities here.\nINFO please\nSo...she is pregnant, and I can't ask you what your pregnancy with your kids was like because it's different for everyone and every pregnancy (also personal info none of my business).\nShe is trying to accommodate this because I imagine with how far along she is her body is not feeling the greatest (speculation on my part).\nBut you're more concerned about fairness that others don't also get extra accomodations?\n\nI'm trying to think like...if you had a broken leg or medical issue that made life harder for you and decided to pony up for better accomodations so a trip is less hellish and someone said that wasn't fair to them would you downgrade your accomodations to be \"fair\" to them?\n\nI legitimately don't understand why you are so adamant about this and I am currently leaning towards AH unless you can provide some context of why this makes sense.", "Omg how dare your 6 months pregnant daughter pay her own money on a more comfortable seat while you fly to Tahiti like peasants. How dare she!! \nYTA of course", "YTA. Without a doubt you are the AH!  Your daughter paid for her ticket, she can upgrade it if she wants.  You don't get to tell her what she can and can't do, she's an adult.  Sounds like you are just jealous that she upgraded and you didn't. Get over yourself!\n\nETA: missed your comment about her husband being rich.  So you are definitely jealous your daughter can afford things you can't.  My god, be happy that your daughter can do these things.  You're behaviour is apalling, it's not about fairness, it's outright jealousy!  Do you want to be part of your grandchild's life?

You were absolutely awful about making her downgrade!", "YTA. The justification of, \" well I did ___ and turned out fine.\" Is ridiculous. You should want better for your children then what you had.\n\nThis reminds me of  parents who were hit as kids who insist it wasn't abuse and they turned out \"just fine.\" It's almost like they are trying to convince themselves of normalizing trauma.", "If she paid for the difference, you're TA.", "YTA and a grown ass toddler lmao.", "Holy shit YTA!", "Hard YTA", "Yes, YTA. It was wrong of you to bully her into sitting in coach. Any one of you're party should be able to buy an upgrade. If you are sorry about bullying your pregnant daughter, you should buy her the upgrade.", "YTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "YTA big time. In fact I feel like this post is fake because how could you have possibly thought it was okay to ask her to downgrade a ticket she paid for just because no one else in the family upgraded their flight. She is pregnant, wants to be comfortable, and paid for her own ticket upgrade.", "YTA. \n\nSorry your broke ass is jealous and bitter that you can't afford to upgrade to business class. \n\nLife isn't fair. I can't believe I'm having to tell a 55 year old this but... grow up and get over it.", "YTA. She is paying for it - so it isn't costing you any money. And your comment about the husband \"She gets it just because her husband is a rich ass who springs for every luxury\". You sound jealous of your daughter and her husband instead of being happy for your daughter. Be happy her husband can afford every luxury for her and your soon to be born grandchild. Sounds like you don't like the husband much either. You are jealous. Stop being jealous and spring for an upgrade for yourself if you want it.", "OMG YTA! She is 6 months pregnant! Did you pay for the upgrade? NO! If anyone else wants to upgrade then they can pay for it!

Lisa spent more money and will receive more with the added money she is spending. This is not preferential treatment. It\u2019s paying for what you get. Also she\u2019s in her 30\u2019s lol who cares if she sits away from the family. \n\nBedsides the fact that your daughter was not being selfish and was not receiving preferential treatment, you are being ridiculous wanting her to be in coach when she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable while pregnant.

She paid for her own ticket!!!", "YTA. Retire the trophy.", ">she was getting preferential treatment that was not available to the rest of us.\n\nThe treatment is available to everyone in the family who is willing to pay for an upgrade. YTA.", "YTA. and a weirdo", "YTA - she spent her money to upgrade her ticket. If anything else wanted to upgrade they could have to. Telling her she has to downgrade because no one else did/could is the unfair part.", "YTA so much. Do you have wider problems with power and control? I'm guessing so.\n\nLisa wasn't getting preferential treatment. She was getting *what she paid for*. You could have done the same. Your stance reeks of petty jealousy. One would have hoped that as a mother yourself, you'd be supportive of your daughter in late pregnancy and wouldn't be actively trying to undermine her comfort... but I guess that's more the domain of caring parents.", "Are any of these real anymore?", "YTA. \n\n1. She\u2019s pregnant.\n2. She\u2019s an adult and can very well decide to use her adult money for whatever kind of ticket.\n3. You\u2019re mad because this makes her \u201cabove\u201d you and broke your \u201cequality\u201d? Sounds like communism.\n\nPlease apologize to your daughter. This was very unnecessary.", "YTA Sounds to me like you were just jealous you didn't get to sit in business, so you want your daughter to be as uncomfortable as you. You remember being pregnant right? it's tough and she should be allowed to get whatever comfort she can during a long flight. You weren't even paying for her ticket so why should you get a say at all??", "Yup, YTA. Lisa was/is pregnant. Any woman who is pregnant gets to think of her own comfort before any social niceties.", "YTA -  I'm weeping at the outrage you were almost made to bear by this obnoxious daughter of yours......WTF. You coerced a 30 year old pregnant lady, who is your daughter no less to sit in seating far less comfortable because you \"didn't think it was fair\"?!?! She is pregnant and you are not What. The. Actual. Fuck does \"FAIR\" have to do with anything here????\n\nEDIT Guessing from your replies that you a) actively hate your daughter b) actively hate your daughter c) don't understand what Fair actually means d) sheesh", "Absolutely NTA. That said you and the rest of the family will of course have to get pregnant before the trip so you won't be getting preferential treatment.", "YTA. Also, wtf?", "YTA. Every single one of you has the exact same option open that she took - pay the extra fee to upgrade your tickets. You all are CHOOSING not to do that. How is that unfair?\n\nThe fact that she's pregnant is of no consequence, this would still be a \"fair\" arrangement of she weren't pregnant.", "YTA you sound like a 5 year old.", "Are you serious?? Preferential treatment would be if she got it for free! What's even wrong with you? \"We're all uncomfortable so you gotta be too\" I'm sorry what?? YTA, I can't believe you even have to ask. You're very obviously the asshole. I don't see how you could possibly see it any other way.", "YTA what the hell do you mean it would be unfair?? If she\u2019s paying she can do what she pleases just like all the other adults on the trip!", "Yta. Why wouldn\u2019t you want you child to be comfortable as she is carrying your grandchild? Keep this up and you I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she keeps you low contact when it comes to her child. Stupid hill for you to die on.", "YTA, it absolutely was available to you as well, all you had to do was pay to upgrade your tickets.", "The \"I didn't get this, so nobody else should\" mentality is the STUPIDEST AND MOST SELFISH thinking ever.\n\nLike damn. I had chicken pox when I was a kid, but i didn't deny my kid the vaccine so she would also have to suffer the same as me.\n\nWtf.\n\nYTA.", "YTA!!! She\u2019s pregnant, uncomfortably so now, and she paid!!! How is it unfair to you that your daughter who is carrying YOUR GRANDCHILD be comfortable on a VERY long flight?", "YTA nothing more is needed to be said.", "YTA your daughter being pregnant has nothing to do with it in the end. SHE paid for the upgrade as she has every right to do, whether she were pregnant or not. I say she\u2019s smart!", "This can\u2019t be real. You\u2019re so much YTA I can\u2019t believe you would even have to ask. She didn\u2019t ask you to pay for her to be upgraded. She did it herself. If you wanted extra treatment YOU pay for yourself. That\u2019s your daughter and your grandkid. God you are so obtuse and selfish. Don\u2019t be surprised when she cuts off all contact with you. I know I would.", "YTA. This makes no sense. This is honestly such a weird take imo. I don\u2019t really understand how you could think she was being selfish. She deserves to be comfortable at 6 months pregnant. You also have every right to upgrade your tickets, it\u2019s very fair in that. It\u2019s not like you aren\u2019t allowed.", "YTA. She paid for the comfort she wanted. You shouldn\u2019t hold that against her. This is simply pure pettiness.", "Have you forgotten what it's like to be six months pregnant? Every little bit of relief and comfort is a blessing. Swollen feet are also an issue especially if one can't stretch comfortably.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Why are you even asking?", "YTA. Why does it bother you so much? She's uncomfortable. Let the women put up her feet. If it bothers you so much, upgrade yourselves, too!", "YTA. Jesus Christ.", "YTA! What makes you think what you did was ok? And to tell her that she can\u2019t come if she doesn\u2019t sit in coach? Do you even love your children? Fair for who? She is PREGNANT and PAYING FOR HER TICKET!! Why would you want her to suffer? Fair for everyone? SHE\u2019S PREGNANT!!! Glad you aren\u2019t my mother.", "YTA\n\nIt's important for you to finally learn that life isn't fair. We don't all get the same things.

Seriously?", "YTA\u2014 what\u2019s wrong with her taking good care of herself?  You are not in nursery school where it feels unfair when someone else gets more of something. You are all adults and should have been able to handle not getting what she is getting. What is wrong with her paying to get \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d?", "YTA.

Way to support your pregnant daughter. Sad to think anyone let alone a parent, especially a mother would take this kind of tact here.", "Holy crap, are you serious? YTA. She paid for the upgrade herself. There is nothing stopping the rest of you from doing the same if you wanted. It's not selfish for a pregnant woman to want a little more comfort on a flight.", "YTA. You provided the initial ticket and everyone has their own option to upgrade.For those who choose not to upgrade that is okay, if someone wants to upgrade on their dime, the it is not yours to say.  To not allow the is to be very controlling and unpleasant", "LMAO oh come on, lets be honest.\n\nThis in NO WAY had anything to do with 'being fair to the rest of you'. You just didn't like that your daughter was gonna get something nicer than you, and instead of springing for business class, you decided the best way to make yourself feel better was to be super controlling and make sure she didn't get that nicer thing.\n\nYou suck.\n\nShe paid for it, and as a full grown ass adult, she's is 100% correct that it's up to her what class she wants to travel in.\n\nPay to upgrade her back to business and apologize, or don't be surprised when she starts contacting you less.\n\nYTA.", "YTA", "YTA.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nHi Reddit, I need your opinion on a recent family dispute that happened between me (55F) and my daughter, Lisa (30F), regarding our upcoming family trip to Tahiti. I feel like I might have been in the wrong, but I want to hear what others think.\n\nSo, my husband (57M) and I had planned a family trip to Tahiti to celebrate our upcoming wedding anniversary. We had invited our two adult children, Lisa (30F) and Mark (32M), to join us on the trip. However, there was an issue with Lisa, who is currently six months pregnant with her first child. Lisa decided to pay extra to upgrade her airline ticket to business class to ensure she had a more comfortable journey, given her pregnancy.\n\nInitially, I didn't see anything wrong with this, but then I realized that Lisa's decision was unfair to everyone else in the family who was sitting in coach. My husband and I were sitting in coach, and so was my son Mark. Lisa upgrading to business class meant that she was getting preferential treatment that was not available to the rest of us. I thought this was very selfish of her.\n\nSo, I confronted Lisa about this issue and told her that if she wanted to come on the trip, she would have to downgrade her ticket back to coach. Lisa was understandably upset about this and argued that she had paid for her ticket and should be allowed to travel in the class of her choice. However, I stood my ground and insisted that she had to downgrade her ticket.\n\nNow, Lisa is very upset with me and has been telling our extended family and friends about what happened. Some of them have been telling me that I was wrong to force her to downgrade her ticket, while others have been telling Lisa that she was being selfish.\n\nSo, Reddit, I want to know, am I the asshole for making my pregnant daughter sit in coach on our long-haul flight to Tahiti? Should I have let her keep her business class ticket? I'm feeling very conflicted about this and would appreciate your honest opinions.\n\nJust to clarify, Lisa's husband, John (32M), was not coming on the trip with us.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yes, YTA, she's 6 months pregnant, for god's sake. She's not being an entitled princess for wanting to be slightly more comfortable on a long flight while she is making a whole other human person.

Be joyful! Most parents would be thrilled to see their babies grow up and into opportunities they did not have. I know I would.\n\nYTA.", "How\u2019s that jealousy working out for you?", "Holy shit. Have you always been this jealous of your daughter??", "Wow do the troll posts usually get this vindictive this fast? I thought ya\u2019ll liked to bury the lead a little further first.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Except you could have gotten more space when you were pregnant with her if you'd paid for it, which is what your daughter did. And yes, people do tend to get more luxury when they're willing to pay for it. That's the way the world works. \n\nYou're clearly jealous of her financial circumstances and it's really... pretty pathetic.", "She shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for having a husband like that. She\u2019s not doing anything wrong.", "Even if she wasn't pregnant she'd probably upgrade to business just so she wouldn't be trapped for the whole flight next to her spiteful little shrew of a mother. YTA", "It\u2019s tacky as hell to be jealous of your own child.", "Good for her. Shouldn't you be happy for her? My kid never has to go to bed hungry like I did. I'm happy for him. That's how parents are supposed to feel when our kids have advantages we didn't have when we were their age.", "As a soon to be parent, I can't imagine not wanting my child to be better off than me. I'd want them to experience and get all of the things I never had. I can't imagine comparing myself to my kids in such a disgusting way. \n\nYTA x 1000. She's bringing your grandchild into the world, let her be comfortable even if you weren't during your pregnancy.", "I\u2019d say I can\u2019t wait for you to not be allowed to see your grandkid but judging by how much you clearly hate your daughter I doubt you care", "Woooooow this is cold. You literally said, I suffered so you should too? How do you not want to see your child happy? She\u2019s paying for it herself! Yta", "What a terrible jealous asshole you are, mad because you made poor choices and married a broke ass?", "Yes, yes she does.  If you value flying business that much, maybe you should have married a \"rich ass\" too.", "Sounds like you hate your daughter", "Yup she does. She can afford it. She gets it. Not her fault you\u2019re a jealous AH.\n\nConsidering plane seats have gotten smaller over the years, you actually did get more space in coach than she did.

Who hurted you for you to want to make your daughter uncomfortable. Also if you take into account that flightseats have become smaller over the years\u2026.", "You\u2019re so gross- you really are jealous of your own child. What happening to wanting more for your children. You want less for then because you didn\u2019t have it. Calling your SIL a rich ass? Hope she goes NC with you.", "LOL. So mad that you got a cheap husband. You\u2019re one of those people who just hate people for being rich huh? Good luck when she sees how little you care about her. Have fun not being able to visit your grandchild.", "Aaaaah, the resentment comes out. You're def the AH.", "You sound very bitter, and envious of your daughter\u2019s life.

YTA", "You would have gotten more space when you were pregnant with her--if you had paid for it. She paid for it. She's not receiving preferential treatment. She is taking care of herself because she knows what she needs. It would have been unfair or receiving preferential treatment if one person was paying for everything and gave her MORE than you. But that's not the case. Your arguments in defense of yourself make even less logical sense than your actual problem. They only go to show that you are simply jealous and bitter that your daughter is doing well enough for herself to make sure she is comfortable.", "You are such a horrible mother it\u2019s beyond words I could put on here. I don\u2019t care what you did when you were pregnant, this is your daughter pregnant now and she wants to upgrade, I truly hope she cancels. And please show her this Reddit post. I wouldn\u2019t want to spend five minutes with you and please stay away from your grandchild you are so bitter.", "there it is.", "If you're so bitter about your daughter being richer than you then find a way to also be rich? What is it that you're hoping for here? If you think she's spoiled then keep it to yourself, it's not your place to tell her how to spend her money.", "Well, I have good news for you! Very soon you won\u2019t have to deal with her, or her rich husband, once she comes to her senses and realizes how much happier she\u2019ll be without you.", "Right?", "Haha exactly. Also now that she shared this story. Where\u2019s our trip to Tahiti?! Cmon share with the class OP!", "> And a few generations ago pregnant women sat in horse drawn carriages while pregnant what is your point?\n\nI had to chuckle over this - well done, I was trying to think of a comment about this reply but you have outdone us all", "LOL.  You win.", "Must\u2019ve been a rough trip!", "No, a literal greyhound.

Cue violins.", "Of your own child too! I thought our job as a parent was to be happy our kids can afford business class.", "My grandmother wanted better than she had for my mother. Mum wanted better for me. I'm trying damn hard to ensure my kids get better. My family isn't perfect, but damn! This woman is awful. \n\nI bet OP is one of those \"It's selfish not to have children\" but also \"I had kids so they can support me in my old age\" people. Pathetic!", "No, it's not! It's not annoying at all! Only an incredibly pathetic, jealous person would find that annoying.", "It's pretty pathetic how jealous you are because your PREGNANT daughter decided to pay extra money to be more comfortable on a flight. I wouldn't go on a trip with you at all after that.", "No. I don't think that's annoying at all. You seem to want to make your daughter uncomfortable. \n\nThe last time I flew on a plane for 10 hours, my feet looked like sausages and I wasn't pregnant. Let her have the 5 extra inches to stretch out.", "I dunno, I find it more FUCKING annoying that you want to make your daughter more uncomfortable than she needs to be just because you\u2019re jealous.", "For a normal and mature adult human, no, it wouldn\u2019t be, since she paid for it herself.", "To a child. A really, really stunted child.", "No, because as parents we should want good things for our kids.", "No. It isn't. \n\nYou can pay to upgrade yours too.\n\nIt's a ride on a plane. Who cares where people sit??", "I'm confused - you can afford a huge ass vacation, but can't afford to bump to business class.

Because you should be PROUD of your daughter for doing better than y'all did at her age! That she's able to afford even little things like a seat upgrade without having to worry about the bills due next week or month!\n\nYou are so deep in your jealousy that you can't see how amazing your kid is doing at life! Yes it's a simple seat upgrade but ffs you should ALWAYS want your kids to do better than you did. Regardless of what it is.", "As a parent, shouldn't you want the best for your children and a better life than you had, instead of being jealous of them?!\n\nSo many people have pointed out to you that she is NOT getting preferential treatment, but you've not acknowledged once because there is no justifiable answer. \n\nIf they had upgraded her for free, yes, it would be preferential. They didn't though, she paid for it, and getting what you paid for is a transaction. You are neither morally or grammatically correct. \n\nYou've also said that it's unfair that she gets to experience that just because she married rich. If anyone said to you that it's not HER fault you married poor to someone who can't afford business class tickets, you would no doubt be offended, so why is it ok the other way round?!. \n\nHonestly, you are a jealous bitter old lady and it's totally gross \ud83e\udd2e", "You're a pathetic human...", "What is wrong with you? You're annoyed that your child is doing better than you? Isn't that the goal?

Maybe quit the toddler tantrum, hmm?  It's unbecoming of a woman of advancing years.", "No. You basically want her husband to spring for you too, don\u2019t you? And you\u2019re taking it out on your daughter, who you should want good things for. What kind of parent are you? This is pathetic. Jealous of your own daughter.
