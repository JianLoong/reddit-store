He screwed up, so he should pay for it. Bet he remembers next time.", "NTA- think not paying for Uber and nights out is fair. It\u2019s not about \u201cfault\u201d but life, accidents happen and someone has to pay for the repairs.", "NTA. While he didn't cause the accident, he was the reason you couldn't get your car fixed for free. That was his mistake. That is why he needs to repay you.", "NTA. If I understand correctly, you are only withholding extra funding/asking him to contribute funding up to the cost of the repairs. There is no additional punishment beyond paying back the 2.5k. in that case, I would not call it a punishment, but rather a natural consequence of his actions. If I were the parent, instead of monitoring his expenses and income, I would just ask him to pay the amount back on a reasonable timeline and let him figure out how to do that. \n\nHe is also NTA though. He acted out of shock and empathy. His natural instinct when seeing someone get hurt was concern rather than anger. I think this means he's a decent human being and you raised him well. He's young, sounds like it's his first time in an accident, he probably just wasn't able to think straight in that moment. If I were the parent, I wouldn't scold or guilt him much and just let the natural consequence of having to pay for repairs be the lesson.", "NTA - if he's college age then he's 100% old enough to know to get info from the other driver.", "NTA. This is a no-brainer. Consequences have actions. What if the other person tried to screw with your son by calling the cops after your son left, saying it was a hit and run?", "NTA, that\u2019s not punishment, that\u2019s a consequence of his actions.", "NTA\n\nEven if he didn't cause the accident, he chose not to get insurance details and it's only fair that he should pay off the damages.\n\nIt seems like nothing he did was malicious, but if he has a driver's license he should know the rules of the road and what to do after an accident. Plus you've specifically told him what to do in an accident and he chose not to do it. He is an adult and you can't make bad decisions and expect to be bailed out, especially by a single mother with other children. It sucks that him being \"nice\" to this other person has cost him money, but that is the consequence of his choice. Why should you and his siblings have to struggle with money because of his choices?\n\nAlso, if he's off to uni, he can get a job if he wants more money?!\n\nYou can thank God that your son was not injured whilst also holding him responsible for his actions, the two are not mutually exclusive.", "NTA you\u2019re not really punishing your son. You are still helping out with school where you can but you have two other children to financially care for and it sounds like 2.5k is a pretty big financial burden. He can sacrifice luxuries while it gets paid off or get a job to help pay the difference. Are you punishing him? No, but is he getting a reminder of what to do when an accident happens again Tia void the financial burden yes\u2026yes he is.", "NAH - your son panicked and did the wrong thing in an extremely stressful situation that was outside his experience. So he's not exactly an asshole for that, even if he did make a massive mistake.\n\nBut there's a cost to that and if he's old enough to drive he's old enough to understand the consequences and to learn for next time that he needs to do differently. You're certainly not an asshole for expecting him to understand that and to take the responsibility for his actions and the effects that they have had. It's tough luck for your kid that his first mistake was a big one, but it's not unfair to expect him to deal with that.\n\nYour mother is kind of an asshole for getting involved and telling you off, but as an indulgent granny who's only heard your son's side of this it seems like she might not have an entirely accurate picture of what you're expecting from your son here, so I'd reserve judgement on her unless she's heard your side and is still telling you off.", "NTA.  Your son was involved in an accident.  It's only fair that he paid to repair your car. If he's old enough to borrow your car, he's old enough to assume responsibility for what happened when he used it. \n\nHad he gotten the other driver's name and contact information, he (with your help) might have been able to pursue that driver's paying for the results of the accident they caused. But he didn't.  Hopefully, he'll remember to do so in the future. \n\nIf his Nan continues to object, invite her to gift him the money to repair the car.", "NTA. You're not punishing him for the accident. You're making him pay for not being responsible and getting the other drivers details.", "I\u2019m confused are you saying the money you would spend on his phone, transportation, internet, you\u2019re not paying? Monitoring like accounting how much?", "NTA. I\u2019m someone who gets flustered and ditsy when things go wrong. That\u2019s why when I was 19 I printed off a list of things to note down when accidents happen, and put it in my car.", "NTA.\n\nIt's really common sense to get the information of the other driver in the accident; especially if he wasn\u2019t at fault. Even if someone had their first ever car accident, they will already know to exchange information", "NTA. Learning how to handle the aftermath of an accident is part of learning how to be a responsible driver. Fail to follow correct procedure, suffer consequences. As long as what support you withhold is in proportion to and goes toward restitution for the monetary cost of the damage, you are good.", "NTA, you are not punishing him for an accident, you are very reasonably expecting him to either save you or reimburse you for the 2500 his negligence to take the other driver's data had costed you. \n\nYou might consider that being in an accident is extremely stressful, especially when someone is hurt. But with two more kids needing your support, you're the best person to make financial decisions about your family.", "NTA. You're punishing him for what my state calls \"conduct after an accident,\"  which around here could result in criminal charges, and the punishment is that he doesn't get \"nice to haves\" which you're not obligated to cover anyway.", "Have you considered that the accident was his fault and he was afraid to tell you?", "INGO: Don't you have insurance?", "INFO:\n\nWhy are you not carrying basic uninsured/under insured liability insurance coverages? I work in insurance, and if he wasn't at fault, then it would be covered under these options even if you don't carry physical damage coverage on your car. Did you make a claim?\n\nIt's common for young drivers in the stress of a first accident to miss steps like this.", "YTA kind of. Exchanging information after a crash is an important lesson and when you fail at that there are consequences. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like the accident was his fault and he seems to have had genuine concerns for the other driver. \n\nI think your solution is a bit harsh considering he was not at fault.
