This is a lesson all of us parents learn. You\u2019re NTA for allowing your husband a Father\u2019s Day of his choosing, and quite frankly, he\u2019s doing more of the \u201cboots on the ground\u201d parenting at the moment than your dad. \n\nThat said, you might have avoided the hurt feelings if you made plans with your dad ahead of time (we do same weekend, or the next weekend for grandparents) so he didn\u2019t feel neglected.", "A day is just a day.  It doesnt have to be exactly that day.  Like someone else said. If you wanted can do something on a nearby date\n\nAs someone else said. Your husband is now a closer father engagement than your not living together father isZ\n\nYou should have communicated but change is natural", "NTA. Grandparents day is September 10th. Father's Day was about your spouse!", "NTA. Could your Dad not come visit at your place for supper or breakfast? Thats what we did for my first fathers day. Spent the morning and afternoon by ourselves then grandparents came over for a barbeque in the evening", "NTA\n\nThere's grandparents day if you want to celebrate your dad for a whole day. There's also his birthday and any other day of the year you can honor him for being a good dad (if he was). This is your husband's day now.\n\nMaybe you should have communicated that you were going to celebrate differently this year, but in the end, the day is about the father of your child now.", "Do you usually visit your dad on Father\u2019s Day? Is this is first grand child? \nDo you have siblings that he could have celebrated Father\u2019s Day with? \n\nThere are loads of variables that need to be considered her. \n\nI think to make it up to him get a card on behalf of your son and one from yourself, and go and see him sometime in the week. \n\nMaybe daddy just needs a little love from his baby and grand baby", "NAH. Your father is valid in his disappointment, but he also will need to come to terms with the fact that the birth of your child and becoming a grandparent has changed his life and relationships in permanent ways as an extension of the fact that your life is entirely changed and re-ordered to prioritize care of your child. And the large majority of minimal spare time you have has to go toward care of yourselves in those early months. \n\nYou\u2019ll all be fine. Extra hugs next time.", "NTA\n\nI am a firm believer in once you marry, your new family takes priority.  Not saying to totally neglect siblings or parents but THIS is your family now.  \n\nTalk to dad and let him know you understand why he is upset but remind him of HIS first fathers day and how special it was to him.

I have to disagree with some other posters here. I'm not sure I understand the all or nothing mentality.  I think it was very hurtful not to visit your dad. You didn't need to spend the day but you could have spent an hour. You could have also asked him to come over and specified the time. Or you could have asked to visit and celebrate on Saturday,  instead of Sunday.  There was no reason why both dads couldn't have been made to feel a little special.", "YTA!
