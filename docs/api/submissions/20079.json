This is a lesson all of us parents learn. You\u2019re NTA for allowing your husband a Father\u2019s Day of his choosing, and quite frankly, he\u2019s doing more of the \u201cboots on the ground\u201d parenting at the moment than your dad. \n\nThat said, you might have avoided the hurt feelings if you made plans with your dad ahead of time (we do same weekend, or the next weekend for grandparents) so he didn\u2019t feel neglected.", "A day is just a day.  It doesnt have to be exactly that day.  Like someone else said. If you wanted can do something on a nearby date\n\nAs someone else said. Your husband is now a closer father engagement than your not living together father isZ\n\nYou should have communicated but change is natural", "NTA. Grandparents day is September 10th. Father's Day was about your spouse!", "NTA. Could your Dad not come visit at your place for supper or breakfast? Thats what we did for my first fathers day. Spent the morning and afternoon by ourselves then grandparents came over for a barbeque in the evening", "NTA\n\nThere's grandparents day if you want to celebrate your dad for a whole day. There's also his birthday and any other day of the year you can honor him for being a good dad (if he was). This is your husband's day now.\n\nMaybe you should have communicated that you were going to celebrate differently this year, but in the end, the day is about the father of your child now.", "Do you usually visit your dad on Father\u2019s Day? Is this is first grand child? \nDo you have siblings that he could have celebrated Father\u2019s Day with? \n\nThere are loads of variables that need to be considered her. \n\nI think to make it up to him get a card on behalf of your son and one from yourself, and go and see him sometime in the week. \n\nMaybe daddy just needs a little love from his baby and grand baby", "NAH. Your father is valid in his disappointment, but he also will need to come to terms with the fact that the birth of your child and becoming a grandparent has changed his life and relationships in permanent ways as an extension of the fact that your life is entirely changed and re-ordered to prioritize care of your child. And the large majority of minimal spare time you have has to go toward care of yourselves in those early months. \n\nYou\u2019ll all be fine. Extra hugs next time.", "NTA\n\nI am a firm believer in once you marry, your new family takes priority.  Not saying to totally neglect siblings or parents but THIS is your family now.  \n\nTalk to dad and let him know you understand why he is upset but remind him of HIS first fathers day and how special it was to him.  You may want to toss in something about not tarnishing your husbands first fathers day with any further negativity from dad and future comments.", "NTA\n\nMy in-laws pressure my husband and I to visit every single holiday. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve ever been able to just enjoy a Mother\u2019s Day with my own children.  Granted, my husband would support not going to visit, but his mother has a passive aggressive way of making you feel too guilty to enjoy the day even if you don\u2019t go. I have vowed not to put my own children in this position.", "INFO: How far away do you live from your father?", "No assholes here. Sometimes you have other priorities, and of course your dad will be a little upset. Just make it up by visiting another time and having a belated celebration for him.", "INFO: did you tell your dad ahead of time that you wouldn\u2019t be able to come? Did you call him to wish him Happy Father\u2019s Day or send him a card?", "NTA. What you do with your time is your choice. Especially with a tiny baby! That's exhausting. If your dad doesn't know you love him unless you visit him on a specific day, there's a deeper issue he needs to be dealing with within himself. That's not on you unless you're usually just an AH to him.", "NTA he got a phone call he needs to get over it. 45 minute drive is ridiculous witha 3 month old.", "*info: did you call your father? How far is the drive to visit?", "NTA. Your father is an adult, he should act like one. You have a three month old, you are right at the stage of sleep deprivation and your whole life revolving around the kid. Your husband deserved to have the day to himself. Your father should understand that.", "NTA- since its the first one, yes that should totally be spent at home with the new parents to enough.  Long as you called your Dad to wish him a lovely day and told him beforehand your plans its all fine.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour husband is your kid's father - THAT should be your priority.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour own parents come second.", "YTA.  I have to disagree with some other posters here. I'm not sure I understand the all or nothing mentality.  I think it was very hurtful not to visit your dad. You didn't need to spend the day but you could have spent an hour. You could have also asked him to come over and specified the time. Or you could have asked to visit and celebrate on Saturday,  instead of Sunday.  There was no reason why both dads couldn't have been made to feel a little special.", "YTA! You didn't see your father on Father's Day, your child saw his. You could have easily had breakfast with him and done your things and had the rest of the day to rest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My children are young adults and my father got pissed off this year because my husband wanted to spend a weekend away with our kids before they both go out and live on their own. EVERY year my husband has asked to do his own thing on Father's day, my father throws a snit. \n\nMaking plans ahead of time for a different day or weekend may help, but honestly, my dad will make this day about him until he dies. Right is when he gets what he wants, wrong is when you don't give it to him.\n\nI hope it doesn't happen to you, but if it does, live your life. Make your memories. Acknowledge your dad, but give your kid's dad what he wants and needs. You won't indulge your toddler's tantrums, and you shouldn't indulge his grandpa's either.", "NTA..\n\n\nMy Dad got a quick call and a card.....\n\n\nHis present will arrive tomorrow......\n\n\nHes an adult and knows that as I'm also an adult with a life that includes a husband and family he's no longer the sole focus.....", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s wishes should get precedence over your father\u2019s as he\u2019s the one who\u2019s actively parenting and the father of a newborn, to boot.\n\nIt sounds like your father wanted you to come but never invited you? What, you\u2019re supposed to read his mind? He is being selfish and passive aggressive. He doesn\u2019t have the right to make demands on your time, especially not by complaining after the fact when it seems he never made his wishes known. Make plans to get together at your mutual convenience, not his alone.", "NAH. I can see both sides. There could have been a effort to do something together. You could have possibly invited him over. There doesn't need to be elan either or celebration.", "If you don't value your own father and couldn't plan to spend just a few short hours with him, that speaks volumes to your father.\n\nI don't see why you couldn't have met the needs/wants of both fathers!", "Not a popular opinion, butI think that the kind and considerate thing to do would have been to invite your father over for a brief visit and to have told him how much you love and appreciate him in person.  \n\nThe man has had babies.  He gets how exhausted you are, how poopy your house is, and how you just want to take a nap.  But for the love of God, let him hug his child and hold his grandchild on the day the whole country is making a big deal about how much fathers are appreciated!  I just don't see how this would detract from your husband's first Father's Day.\n\nI think that the way you handled this was unnecessarily hurtful,, inconsiderate, and unnecessary.\n\nYTA", "YTA", "You child will never remember this Father\u2019s Day. Your father will never forget it. A 3 generation moment might have been a special celebration. Having said this, NTA. It doesn\u2019t seem I\u2019ll intended.", "YTA", "NTA - it's good to kick the older generation to the curb once the new one arrives. I'm sure you'll agree on the 1st Mother's Day your child misses because of your grandchild.", "Planning ahead saves so many potentially hurt feelings. Makes things easier on everyone.", "We don't want people over right now. House smells like poop.", "Yes, I do. Yes, it is. No, my brother is overseas. I already got him a card.", "Forty-five minutes, depending on traffic", "Yes, I called him. It is normally forty-five minutes.", "Heck yeah. One of my first Mother\u2019s Days, my MIL got very angry at my husband for neglecting her on Mother\u2019s Day. I get where she was coming from. I don\u2019t regret getting my own day, but also I don\u2019t think grandparents should be expected to sit out the holiday without some kind of acknowledgment. Planning ahead ensures everyone feels rightfully recognized.", "Poop smelling house is a given with a new born.  \nAn open box of baking soda at the bottom of the diaper genie does wonders.\nEdit - I do understand not wanting anyone over right now", "I don\u2019t think your TA per se, but maybe dad was just feeling a little lonely. Everyone\u2019s feelings/reasonings are valid here, I think the best thing to do in the future is maybe see your dad on the Saturday so he still gets his own Father\u2019s Day, then call him or FaceTime him on the Sunday, that way he doesn\u2019t feel forgotten. It\u2019s also his first Father\u2019s Day as a grandfather so he might have been excited about that and is just sad he didn\u2019t get to spend it the way he would have liked too. Maybe you could plan a Father\u2019s Day brunch going forward so both your husband and father can be celebrated.", "Did you call him at least?", "YTA. Your husband isn't *your* father. And a 3mo baby doesn't have any concept of the day obviously. So you 3 hanging around the house relaxing is nothing more than that. When your child is a little older then yeah the \"main\" Father's Day event is between your husband and your kid.\n\nYou could have taken the kid to your father's for a short visit, even leaving your husband home to relax.\n\n[I see you re-thought your nasty remark below and deleted it.  <<\"Main Father's Day\". Spoken like the bitter old man you are.\">>\n\nFor the record, I'm a woman with a husband and kids.  I just recognize that it's possible to honor both the fathers in my life.]", "Yep", "It\u2019s fairly common for adult children to prioritize their new family units for holidays. When you marry your partner you are effectively forming a new family unit by choice. Calling her father on Father\u2019s Day to wish him a happy Father\u2019s Day is still honoring him as a father, it just acknowledges the new family structure to focus the day around her husband and his first Father\u2019s Day as a father.", "\"Main Father's Day\".
