I used to be a quote on quote good wife and I used to visit all the time for Christmas, football games,BBQs, birthdays...basically everything. My sister in laws used to ignore me and go upstairs to their rooms to talk and ignored me. My sister in laws used to go out and never invite me. Other boyfriends and girlfriends of the family used to ask why I was always left out. Keep in mind I used to babysit my sister in laws daughter while she used to go out drinking with her boyfriend. My other sister in never put in time to get to know me and the other just followed along what the other did. Soon enough their brothers went to events and I was never invited to football games and tailgating. Im not that much order than they are and I was always confused why I never was included. His sisters and brothers have left me out of their weddings. Now I no longer visit my in laws and I feel much better. My heart used to break repeatedly when I tried to get to know them and spend time with them and never was invited even though I babysat and tried to get along with them. I felt so hurt and heartbroken because I always wanted 8 siblings like my husband had as a kid cause I am an only child. It just didn't work out. I tried to watch football with them, gave them an expensive Xbox with like 40 games, cooked and cleaned. They just never wanted me around. Now my husband is upset because I no longer visit because my therapist said it's toxic and it hurts me. I no longer try to build relationships with them and I just stay home and try to take care of myself when my husband visits his family. I haven't visited his parents house in 8 years. The problem is that it's causing a rift in my marriage. I don't know what to do. No one deserves to be treated the way I have been treated by my brothers and sister in laws.", "created_utc": 1669432649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4wkc7/aita_because_i_no_longer_visit_my_in_laws/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why keep trying to forge relationships with people who don\u2019t want one with you? Your therapist is right, it\u2019s toxic and you should remove yourself from harms way. Good for you for saying \u201cno.\u201d \n\nBut the rift in your marriage\u2026 Your husband is being extremely short sighted here. How does he not see what\u2019s going on? His siblings are being intentionally hurtful and continuously excluded you. They got what they wanted, which is for you to disappear. If your husband has a problem with you not being around at his family\u2019s functions, he needs to address it with THEM, not with you. It\u2019s concerning that he has no awareness of what\u2019s been going on for 12 years, no empathy for HIS WIFE, and his knee jerk reaction is to force you into a toxic situation instead of protecting you and standing up to your abusers. Your *sisters in law* are TAs here, not you. Hopefully your husband will be able to recognize that before it\u2019s too late.", "NTA. Have your therapist explain it to your husband. You are following the recommendation of a professional.", "NTA but why is your husband ok with them treating you so poorly? You\u2019re not a human meat shield.

Don\u2019t visit them like you are.

Specifically what the fuck is hubby doing?  Is he blind to what is going on between OP and his siblings?  Or does he not give a shit?  Has OP even attempted to articulate her feelings and perspective on what is going on to hubby?  Lots missing here.", "NTA. I have been avoiding events with my inlaws for 20+ years now for this very reason. My wife and I got into it once. I told her I was not going to be using my vacation days nor taking time away from my family (parents, sibling) to spend a day or a weekend isolated and ignored.  And it's nothing against my inlaws, they are fine people. We just don't click. They haven't been complaining about me not being there, either. I'm glad she has the support system. I'm glad they have fun together. I want my days off and holidays to be fun as well, so I do my own thing.", "NTA. Your husband should have stood up for you years ago. If your marriage is otherwise good, take him to at least one of your therapy sessions, preferably more, and discuss how his family's toxic behavior impacts you. He cannot reasonably expect you to continue to invest your time and energy into one-sided relationships with people who treat you rudely despite your efforts to be nice to them.", "You don\u2019t have an inlaws problem. You have a husband let\u2019s you be disrespected problem. The rift is because you stopped letting it happen over after over. He\u2019s still not standing up for you. He\u2019s still not defending you to his family, and he\u2019s still not demanding you be treated with respect. What he is doing is making it clear that his family mean more to him than you do. Given that he has to go against one side or the other, he\u2019s with them. \n\nThe rift will get better when he realizes and begins to enforce boundaries that require you be treated respectfully.

I have a similar situation going on and we\u2019re going to couples therapy to talk about this bc he\u2019s not seeing where I\u2019m coming from - the simple fact is they don\u2019t see you as family \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

He should have noticed the poor treatment 12+ years ago. Not to mention the wake up call 8 years ago when she stopped attending. To complain now is essentially perpetuating their shitty behavior. He needs to get his head out of his ass or she will not be showing up for him either", "We get into arguments Because I don't go to his parents house. He gets mad when he goes over and his hot wife isn't there to show off. I told him I love and support him and I want him to have a loving relationship with his family but I cannot be ignored and treated like a piece of furniture by his brothers and sisters. the ball is in his court.", "Yes, he doesn't realize it at all and in marriage counseling he says I don't try hard enough. I tried for years to be a part of his sisters and brothers. I bent over backwards and I got hurt in the process. My marriage counselor agrees with me and says he needs to live in my shoes.", ">You get to choose who you interact with and so do they.\n\nYes. Use your energy on people who matter", "I don't go to places where I am not wanted. No one wants to be ignored. Even Christmas is awkward cause they will all give each other very cute Victoria secret  pajamas and give me an ugly old lady pajama (which I will say I love and graciously say thank you). Just imagine if the mean girls were literally your sister in laws. I try to be nice to them and treat them with love and respect because I believe in the Golden rule. I just feel like I spend too much energy on them and it just hurts because it would be nice to have brothers and sister in laws I can count on like a brother or sister. They just don't treat me well and it's hurts deeply.", "Thank you.", "Just expected to suck up and act like a happy Robot which is why I don't go to my in laws. It's weird and awkward too cause if I do go I will end up playing Tetris on my phone and spend hours alone in the garage cause no one will notice if I left. At least at home I can do some self care and read something that is positive and upbeat.", "No, he has not. His sisters have complained to him that I no longer show up but I never understood why because they ignore me. I asked my therapist if maybe I mis communicated with them but he said I did all I could to build a relationship.", "Is hubby taking part in marriage counseling as well (are you doing couple\u2019s therapy) or does he think everything is honky dory, that you just need to try harder?

He just decides to ignore it.\nHe doesn't have your back.", "Not Christmas, New Years, or the 4th or anything you spend all day.  I was imagining Memorial Day breakfast or Easter lunch.  Something shorter and less important, with your hubby calling out their bad behavior and asking them to do better.  If the holiday was ATVs neutral location like a restaurant, even better. \n\nStill, nothing but respect for your choice.  I hope your husband gets past this for your sake.", "He participates in couples therapy. According to him. He thinks everything is honky Dory and I should work harder to be part of his sisters and brothers. I have been left out of photos, ignored at parties, my son cried because he wasn't invited to a holloween stroller strides party for kids (which we said we would pay for). I cannot put anymore energy into trying to be a part of their world. It hurts too much and I need to protect myself and my kid.", "I always felt like he didn't have my back. Then I tried to break up with once after an argument about his brothers and sisters and then he begs and pleads to have me back and he says he will fix it but never does.", "NTA - Your husband and his family are causing the rift in the marriage. You are blameless here. You have the right to protect your well being and if your husband wants you to do things that will hurt you, then he's not a very good husband.\n\nNone of this is your fault, you are not causing the rift.", "You...NTA\n\nHubby...TA\n\nIf their treatment of you hurts and all he worries about is the family, to your detriment, than he is TA...and you need to understand that before you deal with his family.", "NTA, you might want to reconsider your future with such a prick of a husband.", "Is he aware you're an actual person and not just a prop? Like... if you were a real doll or whatever those sex things are called it'd be fine to prop you up in the corner and have you ignored by his family...\n\nBut you're an actual human being and it's horrifically selfish for him to demand you show up and look hot while he let's his family treat you like shit.\n\nDoes he really think it's okay if you're miserable as long as you make him look good?", "NTA but your husband and his family sure are. I know that you need to practice self care and I commend you for it.\n\nI do wish sometimes therapists would teach those who have been treated so poorly to stand up for themselves though. Maybe it's just because I am getting older and have less $#@\u00d7s to give but I will absolutely haul anyone who does this sort of thing over hot coals. \n\nPeople behave like this because they are allowed to get away with it and it's something I hate to see. It's not hard to have manners, behave with civility and kindness and bad behavior needs to be rewarded with consequences.  I also think bystanders don't get to just watch, they also need to be part of the solution. If you see injustice, bullying, outright cruelty for Gods sake say something.   I just don't get it..\n\nI wish you a better life with a husband who respects and defends you,  and a family that you get to choose to be a part of that is a true, loving caring family.  You deserve better.", "Some men are truly blind to the hurt their family can inflict on those that marry in.  Have him come in on a therapy session and see if your therapist can get hum to see.", " I'm sorry but there no chance in hell he doesn't know what his siblings are doing to you. He just decides to ignore it.", "At this point, I think it's fair to say you don't (just) have a problem with your husband's family, you have a problem with your husband.\n\nIf he wants you to spend time with his family, he can put some work in to figure out why they don't like you and don't want you around. \n\nHe appears to have zero empathy for you and your son, and if he wants something to change he's going to have to start making some efforts to change things. You've already done more than is reasonable and it's done nothing to change things. Why does he think it will work any different now than it did before?"]}
