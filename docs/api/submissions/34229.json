If he has no negative experiences with British people (directly or indirectly) then he's done exactly what every racist/xenophobe does - picked a group he feels he can be justified to hate, blamed them for everything that has ever gone wrong in his life (despite this not being accurate, considering that he is an immigrant to the US), and used them as a scapegoat for all his ills and an outlet for his hatred and negativity. Yes, there is definitely a past there and Britain did a lot of damage to India that it needs to atone for, but (as you rightly point out) that is in the past and not the fault of teens born decades after independence was secured.\n\nI think you should be proud of yourself for seeing the flaws in your father's argument and not allowing the things he will have taught you to prejudice your view of the world or the people you meet.

The denial of what they did to India and the rest of the empire is a problem, the continued racism targeting south Asians is appalling. Spend a year living there if you can, it might surprise you that your father is on to something.", "NTA, but I want to tell you this.\n\nColonization's effects aren't over. Due to colonization, (most of) the colonized countries were left out of prosperous effects of Industrial Revolution for a very long time (to put into context, the west wasn't deprived of the hindu-arabic numerals or zero etc.). Plus it instilled a massive fear of capitalism and pushed them towards socialism (not equal to welfare). This is why they're \"third world\" countries today.", "NTA! Yes Britain over the centuries has done some bad things to many smaller countries and colonization was painful for people of that time. But your dad still can't generalise all Britishers to be Bad!

Given India\u2019s history, it makes sense to disdain historical Britain and even some aspects of the modern UK, but he\u2019s generalized this to everything British: random British celebrities, British people as a whole, the cricket team, etc. \n\nI find this ridiculous. For starters, my dad was born in 1972, decades after independence, so it\u2019s not like he has firsthand trauma. Even his dad was born in 1950, which was after independence, and he\u2019s the oldest member of our family, meaning nobody in our family even has British occupation in their living memory. Additionally, what do random British people have to do with anything? They weren\u2019t the ones calling the shots, the majority of them weren\u2019t even alive. \n\nIn college this year, I made a friend who initially is from England. He and I became close, and my dad met him when my parents were visiting. My dad flipped out and got mad about my being friends with a British guy. \n\nI told him he\u2019s being ridiculous. My friend is 19, he\u2019s born in 2004, he wasn\u2019t around for colonialism, he has nothing to do with it. Plus, my dad wasn\u2019t around for colonialism either, or even *his* dad. He\u2019s holding onto a ridiculous grudge over something that didn\u2019t even impact him much personally.\n\nHe got angry at me and said I just didn\u2019t understand.

A massive cultural loss. \n\nI don't think your father's an asshole for harboring hatred towards the British.

It\u2019s the dumb and dumber in the comments. He\u2019s NTA for having a friend from England, but to discount the effects of the British is pretty stupid. Plus, SO many people are still alive who have lived through the partition and independence. Not to mention that the Brit\u2019s who did it are still alive.

Kind of hard to forget or undo their effects. Plus the British didn\u2019t leave in 1947, they left India later.

My bestie's family is African-American who's first husband was a WASP male. Her parents were fine with it, but many others in her family were uncomfortable with it due to the family's connection with slavery, particularly since he was from the same city where the prior slave masters had owned the plantation. They got over it once they got to know him, but there was definitely consternation due to the generational trauma of the effects of slavery. Colonialism and the actions of the British are legit reasons for generational trauma, and there is no rule saying which generations can feel most affected, but it still is no reason to have so much hatred towards a whole group of people due to the actions of distant historical figures with whom many of them have no connection!

It's especially weird in the UK, where they love the Indian food, but don't love Indians.\n\nThat said, your dad's being awful though. In terms of issues like this, it needs to be handled case by case. Maybe your friend doesn't agree with how his people acted in the past and is vocal about it.
