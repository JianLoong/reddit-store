Personally though, anything longer than a week or two for me is no longer a guest, you're a tenant. When my nephews (teenagers) come visit for the summer they're expected to do chores like my kids. She's an adult and you aren't her maid/chef/butler/et al. People that visit me know I'm not cleaning up after them because there's a sign: \"Your momma doesn't live here, clean up after yourself.\" Plus, to me a guest that doesn't clean up after themselves doesn't respect me or my house. My guests have a private room with a bathroom that I'm not cleaning up. It'll be clean before they arrive, there's cleaning products under the sink, and I'll clean it again once they're gone. Cleaning during their stay is on them. Also, when I visit, I clean up after myself. It's about mutual respect. I'll wash the dishes if they fed me. I'll vacuum your house when I track dirt in. I'll make my bed and wash the bedding as I'm leaving. I expect others to do the same. \n\nEdit: spelling is hard", "NTA she was acting like a jerk. Sorry you had to go through that.", "NTA\n\n>she handed me the bill for her groceries.\n\nExcuse me? Is that how she think you're supposed to treat family?

I would hate to see how she acts at an actual hotel.", "NTA- if you've made it clear to everyone that they are responisble for the cleaning of their rooms/sheets etc then thats on her.  As for the grocery bill WTH!  Even on vacation you buy your own food and dont expect the hotel to pay for it.
