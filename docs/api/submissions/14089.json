People that visit me know I'm not cleaning up after them because there's a sign: \"Your momma doesn't live here, clean up after yourself.\" Plus, to me a guest that doesn't clean up after themselves doesn't respect me or my house. My guests have a private room with a bathroom that I'm not cleaning up. It'll be clean before they arrive, there's cleaning products under the sink, and I'll clean it again once they're gone. Cleaning during their stay is on them. Also, when I visit, I clean up after myself. It's about mutual respect. I'll wash the dishes if they fed me. I'll vacuum your house when I track dirt in.

When we visit my younger brother and his family in the southwest of England my dad stays with my brother & SIL and I stay with my nephew and his partner.  This is because they each only have one spare bedroom and my nieces don\u2019t have room at all.\n\nMy nephew and his GF have busy lives.  They both work and both play rugby to county level so have training a couple of times a week during the season.  Given enough notice they always make some time to do something with me and my dad and will cook something for me when they are eating too.\n\nThe rest of the time I cook something myself or order takeout.  They won\u2019t take any payment for having me to stay and neither will my brother for putting my dad up so we usually take them out for a meal at least every other visit (we\u2019d do it every time but sometimes they\u2019re just too busy!).\n\nI wouldn\u2019t dream of asking them to reimburse me for any groceries I buy.  If I wanted clean sheets I\u2019d put them on myself AND throw the dirty ones in the washing machine myself.  There are a couple of dishes I make for them while I\u2019m there that my late mum used to make for him, sort of like a tradition.\n\nI\u2019m very proud of how wonderful he and his GF are and I would be horrified if I ever did anything to make them have to throw me out of their house.", "NTA Um, you ARE leaving her alone... alone in her own house.", "NTA.

You stated the rules and your Aunt decided on her own to make you responsible for her. She's horrendous for doing so and knew exactly what she was doing.\n\nLet's take the word Aunt away because it's not irregular for someone to have a mental separation between family vs nonfamily. Put friend instead of Aunt and let's go over the basics of your story with that instead.\n\nYour friend came to stay for a week and extended it. Then, she decided to try and make you do everything for her. She chose to ignore you asking her to treat you like a human being instead of a maid. She chose to disregard the rules.

No. Because it's bullying behavior.\n\nThe term for your Aunt's language/behavior would be DARVO. DARVO stands for \"Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender.\" The perpetrator or offender may Deny the behavior, Attack the individual doing the confronting, and Reverse the roles of Victim and Offender such that the perpetrator assumes the victim role and turns the true victim into the perpetrator.\n\nPeople teach you how to treat them.
