You queried it, he insisted.  He is unreasonable and I would never accept anything from him ever again, nor would i continue being his friend.", "NTA. He insisted on paying and then demanded the money back when it was his mistake that he read the pricing wrong? Also talking shit behind someone\u2019s back is immature and petty, especially over something like this. You can\u2019t give someone money you don\u2019t have, and if he\u2019s aware of your financial situation while demanding money for something he insisted on paying for, I\u2019d stop being friends with him. That\u2019s just disrespectful. It sounds like he\u2019s trying to bully you into paying up, I\u2019d refuse as well.", "NTA, he made the offer without thinking it through and retracted it because he realized it was a bad offer. your friend should have bit the bullet since he already committed to paying for his friends", "NTA. But also, since this happened in the past, why are you still worried about it?", "NTA. Only offer to pay when you have absolutely no expectations of getting that money back. No one needed to go bowling and he should\u2019ve paid more attention. If he couldn\u2019t afford it, he shouldn\u2019t have offered.", "NTA. He had assured you that you wouldn\u2019t have to pay, and since he read the price wrong it\u2019s kinda his problem.", "NTA\n\nHe offered & you queried his willingness to pay several times.It's not your fault he screwed up the what the total cost would be. \n\nThe fact that he's talking behind your back/bullying shows you who he really is.\n\nI'd consider ending that \"friendship\" if you haven't already done so.", "NTA, good on you for standing your ground. You stated many times you couldn\u2019t pay for it and he insisted and said you didn\u2019t have to repay him. It sucks when we mess up, he might double check his facts in the future before he makes offers. He is TA for demanding every one pay him back", "He offered to pay, you bowled, then he changed his mind but you don't have the money.  NTA.", "Nta", "NTA. His decision, he insisted, his problem. \nYou were quite clear over your financial inability to pay. \n\nHis social promise that he reneged on is not your problem. \nAnyone giving you grief is also an AH.", "Not only this friend is an ah, he's also an stupid. He didn't read the prices before paying?", "NTA\nIt's one thing to help a friend out when realizing he misread the price, but another to DEMAND to be paid back.\n\nYou had crearly stated multiple times that you could't afford it, so you weren't in any way obligated to do so.", "NTA, its not your fault that his generosity only extended to the amount that he thought he had to pay for all of you.", "NTA", "NTA.   \n\n\nIt was his suggestion he pays for the bowling, that you refused to attend in first place because you can't afford it. You asked multiple time if he's sure, so it's not like you pushed him into paying for you.  \n\n\nThe mistake is on him so if you can't afford to pay him back he just have to bite the bullet. Next time he should check the price twice to see if he can afford it.", "NTA.  You asked, he insisted.  You only agreed because he insisted.  The fact that he changed his mind isn't your fault.  That is his.", "I think that it was ok for this guy to ask if people could help him out when the cost turned out much higher than expected, but he does not have the right to demand repayment or to badmouth you for not doing so.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  \nIf you had understood that you were responsible for paying your way from the beginning, you wouldn't have gone -- am I right? The only reason you agreed to go is that your friend insisted that he was picking up the bill. And you made your reasoning clear to him when you finally agreed to go, correct?\n\nI get that he was shocked to find that the cost was greater than he had realized, but I think this one's on him. He didn't bother to find out ahead of time what he was setting himself up for.", "You don\u2019t have to pay back. If he is a close enough friend you may wish to. You are under no moral obligation to do so. So NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He insisted on paying and should have double checked the price beforehand.", "Halvsies at best.", "NTA. You said you couldn\u2019t afford it and he insisted on paying. That is on him. If it did turn out to be a lot more expensive then I might have offered a contribution but only if he wasn\u2019t acting entitled about it.", "NTA\n\nHe insisted on an activity you could not afford then wanted his money back. He has a cheek.", "NTA. You were talked into doing something that you wouldn't normally do based on finances. Your finances didn't change just because he didn't pay enough attention.", "NTA. \n\nHis poor money management is his problem.", "NTA. He not only offered to pay, but insisted, and that was the only reason you all ended up going bowling in the first place. I can understand that after he was surprised by the price, he might end up asking if anyone was willing to pay him back since he hadn't expected the total to be what it was, but it's incredibly rude and unfair to insist and there's no way he didn't know that.", "NTA you told him more than once you didn't have the money plus you even asked if he was sure he could pay it, his mistake isn't anyones fault but his", "NTA! x", "NTA. Birds of a feather flock together. You have AH friends. Sometimes you need to cut those types of people and find better ones. He has no honor and the sheeps that surround him have no sympathy towards your financial situation. Those are the types that will never have your back.", "NTA you should talk Shiite behind his back. What a jerk.", "Luckily I'm not his friend anymore, not for this reason tho but yeah", "I think it was a habit and switch.  The friend knew he wouldn't be able to afford it, and planned on having everyone pay them back.\n\nOP was upfront and couldn't afford.  Op should not have to pay this person back.  it wasn't her mistake.\n\nThe so called host got most of the money back.  Why pick on OP?  The friend didn't have the money for two people?\n\nNTA and this person who arranged this is clearly not a freind.", "Nah I just thought about it recently and I was curious what other people think.\n\nWe made up and became friends again 2 years later after this happened, but we never really talked about this.\nI'm not friends with the person anymore tho, for other reasons.", "Bowling prices can be a little deceptive -- like you pay per game and not for the whole session, and shoes cost extra, etc.  Easy to see a young person not realizing the full cost.", "Wait this happened twos years ago and you still brought this up here? That means you still not over that incident.  YTA to yourself and is still bitter.", "Unless he is blind or stupid, it's not hard to ask or check the prices before paying. He most likely didn't check and just wanted to bowl.", "I understand what you mean but I'm really not lol, it's something I laugh about now but I was just curious what people thought about it since there was a pretty split reaction from people when it happened :P"]}
