He tried to convince me to invite him too and said they will stay away from my mom but I told him that I was firm about this. He got angry and we argued.

If you and your dad and his bf aren\u2019t close why did you invite them at all? To limit his invite to one person when your parents have been divorced all these years seems like a petty thing to do. I think if what your mom said was true and your dad used her a his \u201cbeard\u201d she has a right to be upset, but eventually she\u2019s going to have to move on, and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting her battles for her.", "INFO: Do you have a relationship with dad's bf? If your sister is calling dad's bf stepdad, this sounds like a long term relationship. Ultimately it's your wedding, but your mom needs to try to move past this.", "Do you have the right to do it?  Yes, it's  your wedding.\n\nDoes it make you an AH, that you invite your mom's boyfriend, but tell your dad he can't bring his long-term partner who had no impact on your parents' marriage and no role in their breakup, and who apparently has not had issues with you?  Yes.\n\nYTA.", "So, according to your comments your heartbroken mom is bringing a plus one, but your dad isn't allowed to bring a plus one? Make it make sense! \n\nYTA if that's the case.", "I think YTA, honestly. It's been 19ish years since the divorce. Your mother should be able to put her feelings aside for one day. Is your mother remarried?", "Info: did your dad cheat with his bf while married to your mom?", "INFO: how long has your dad been with this boyfriend? Because if your sister is calling him a stepdad, doesn't seem like a new fling.", "IDK. It's almost been two decades - you can't keep your dad or his boyfriend out of your life/moments because it'll upset your mum. If your sister is calling him stepdad I guess it's serious and long term? Might make it harder the longer it goes on too.", "YTA.  If your mother isn't over her divorce 19 years later, that's her problem to solve, not yours.", "YTA reading other comments you are giving your mum a plus 1 but not your dad incase your mum gets upset. Your reasoning is ridiculous", "YTA. Given your comments it sounds like you do this to simply hurt your father.", "Sorry technically NTA since your wedding, your guest list but YTA. As you mentioned in another comment, they\u2019ve been together for 9 years. This isn\u2019t some guy he just met, it\u2019s your dad\u2019s long term partner. Just sit them on opposite sides of the room and be done with it. If your mom has not made any progress on moving past the relationship in over 19 years then she should think about getting some counseling.", "Based on questions and answers from other users and op, I have to go with YTA. This is a dick move to not invite your stepdad (I don't care if they aren't married, they have been together for nine years) and to invite your mother's boyfriend. If you were to say that you weren't going to invite your stepdad because you aren't allowing plus ones, you wouldn't be the ah but I doubt many people would attend.\n\nYour mother also needs to get a grip on reality and wake up. I say this sincerely and without malice. It's been nineteen years since the divorce, but she's still not over it? It sounds like you've been conditioned by your mother to be homophobic, bitter and vile.\n\nAgain, yes, you are the major asshole", "After reading your comments- YTA. My main points below.\n\n1. You don't seem to know for sure that he knew he was gay when they got together. You claim that he tricked her but this isn't necessarily true. He possibly had some internalised homophobia and mistook general feelings of affection for love. Unless he told you he 100% knew he was gay the whole time, you're a bit of an AH for those assumptions.\n2. You've been raised largely by your mother, the person scorned by the breakup. Her feelings and opinions may have influenced you.\n3. If your mother has a plus one it feels a bit cruel to not permit his because of her 'feelings'. It's been years, if she hasn't moved on then thats on her. She doesn't have to talk to him.", "OP, YTA\n\nI see you debating in the comments and it is embarrassing. Dude, just stop. \n\nYour view of sexuality is outdated. Your dad was probably confused as to what he wanted, how he wanted his life to go, etc. You say he lied to your mom about being gay, but realistically he could have still been figuring himself out. Sexuality is confusing, even for those experiencing it. \n\nThe fact that your mom gets to bring her boyfriend is also astounding. Honestly you reek of homophobia. I hope your dad does not attend your wedding, and I hope he takes time to understand that maybe you aren't worth having around if you continue to have these terrible views.", "Reading your replies yes YTA-\nThey have been divorced along time and both moved on. \nYour mom can bring her bf so your dad should be aloud to bring his.", "YTA, it sounds like both your parents moved on with their lives, and you are the one holding a grudge. Is your mother really still upset about the divorce, or is it you? You don't have to invite your dad's partner but be fair and don't invite your mother's boyfriend.", "ITT people forgetting what subreddit they're on. It's am I the asshole, not am I within my rights. YTA.", "YTA. Making someone uncomfortable and ashamed at a function they feel obligated to go to in order to avoid a situation that hasn't even happened yet without first discussing it with both parents first is not the move. \n\nAlso, your mom being hurt about something that happened years ago has no place in your wedding. If she were to hypothetically bring this up before during or after the wedding, it'd be extremely selfish to put on your shoulders for your big day just FYI. \n\nThese situations are never easy and with the info you have provided here it kind of seems like you took a side a long time ago in a situation that grownups should have dealt with themselves and that it's impacting this right now. Everyone is redeemable and what, you're going to never invite your dad's partner to any family functions even when there's grandkids? Why punish the partner? Whatever happened couldn't have been easy on your father either. People make mistakes and hurt others by accident. It's a part of learning how to live.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s your \u201cright\u201d as it\u2019s your wedding, but that doesn\u2019t make it ok. It\u2019s been far too long for your mom to have issues with this still. Tell her to grow up.", "Yta. You're so completely ignorant of what life is like for lgbtq+ people it's scary. You're projecting your rose tinted view of a world that doesn't exist onto your dad and punishing him for not acting like your delusional reality is actually reality.", "YTA.   C,mon..it's been almost 20 years. Time for mom to move on.\n\nYou can invite who you want, but dad has been with his partner for years.", "INFO How long as he been with his boyfriend? He and mom divorced 19 years ago, how long has he been with his SO?", "YTA It's been *19 years* since the divorce, your mum still holding a grudge is pretty concerning. Are you sure she's being truthful about his behavior? And you're a grown up, would you invite his bf if it wasn't for your mum?", "Given your comments YTA man. You need therapy and a deep, personal conversation with your father. Love your sister though sounds like she's a good egg.", "Everything you've said in comments has made two things clear: 1. YTA, because your double standard between your parents reeks of homophobia; and 2. This isn't about your mum not feeling sad.  She's bringing a partner to your wedding, which hints that she's moved on. This sounds entirely about you not moving on. You're stuck as that five year old who can't understand why dad doesn't love mum like you think he should.  It honestly sounds like you don't even want him at your wedding.  If so, that is a conversation you should have directly with him, and also with a psychologist.", "I think you can choose who you invite to your wedding, it's your wedding after all\n\nThe issue is why you're treating your dad like this. Was he a bad dad? Was he neglectful? Was he abusive? Was he a bad husband? Or was he someone who tried to fight his sexuality because people weren't really very accepting? \n\nDo you feel that by leaving his partner out of the wedding that it'll heal your mum's old wounds? Or will it actually isolate your father even more and prove to him that it is in fact his sexuality you have an issue with? \n\nI think maybe you don't agree with his lifestyle but don't want to admit it because it makes you look like a dick. \n\nIf it is purely homophobic then you're definitely TA", "Hey OP.  \nI understand the reason you don't want to invite your father's partner.  \nYou're close to your mom, it sounds like she was the parent you lived with full-time after the divorce, which happened when you were 5. That's an age where you will be beginning to individualise yourself from your parents, as a child, and when you need the safety and stability of a caregiver to help you form your own sense of identity and self.  \n\nIt would have been hard for your mother to experience a divorce, especially when her child was so young. Being a single parent is not easy. Adding in the reason for the divorce (her ex husband coming out as gay), would have cast so much doubt on her perception of her entire marriage and relationship with your father. A lot of \"did he ever love me?\", \"Was he ever attracted to me?\" kinds of thoughts would likely happen as a result. Without reflection, and possibly therapy, these kinds of wounds can continue to go unhealed. They leave a lingering pain that can get infected, causing insecurities and doubts that are really important to address in order to be able to move on.  \n\nAs a child, you likely grew up seeing this unfold in real time. Your primary caregiver, experiencing a major life event (and you also experiencing a major life event), seeing her in pain, her trying to process what has happened, and her emotional state. Any resentment, frustration, fatigue, distress, anger, anguish that she was feeling, you would have picked up on, too. Her experience and the emotional impact would have effected her actions and words, too. So you would have been experiencing the by-products of the divorce at a very young age, and likely experienced them for a long time as you grew older.  \n\nAt the same time, you had to deal with the loss of your father. Having him no longer be present in your life would have been difficult. The family dynamic changed. The household dynamic changed. And you were 5- an age where you can pick up on emotional states and cues, but not necessarily process them and understand them fully.  \nSo growing older, you would have been slowly understanding more about the situation and the emotions, feeling them more, and having to reassess your own thoughts and emotional state about the divorce constantly. Like a puzzle, as you developed, you acquired a new piece each time, and you also were able to comprehend what the picture was of.  \n\nThat's not easy to cope with. And if your primary caregiver is still dealing with their own experience of the situation, you may have not felt like you could seek support from her. You may have felt like you would be burdening your mom, or bringing up painful memories, or opening old wounds if you asked for support around your feelings or needs to process what happened in the divorce. And going to your father likely felt not possible, as he was the cause of the situation.  \n\nThe thing is, this situation is over. It's been over for many, many years now. You're no longer the 5 year old who just lost their stable household dynamic. Your mother isn't in the throes of grief and shock of divorce. You're 24. Your mother has been divorced for 19 years now, and is dating again.   \n\nAs horrible as the divorce was on you and your mother, it also was not an act of malicious evil by your father. It was not a scheme he concocted to use your mother to gain a child, just so he could abandon her and you when he finally had gotten what he wanted.  \nWhile it absolutely may feel like he has hurt and wronged your mother (and you), the feelings you are left with do not mean he is guilty of wrongdoing.  \n\nI'll level with you OP. You said you don't know if your father has had an affair. You say your mum feels like he played her. You say that your father lied to your mom (about his sexuality), and used her.  \nLife, and people, aren't that simple.  \nSexuality can be a very complicated journey for people. One that can take a whole *lifetime* before arriving at some kind of self understanding.  \nThe pressure that a gay or lesbian person goes through can be enormous. Growing up, you're surrounded by stories, books, movies, songs, all these narratives and blueprints for love and life, and most, if not all mainstream ones (especially back in your father's childhood years) outline boy and girl, man and woman. That a man meets a woman, they fall in love, they have children.  \n\nThere's way more that goes into this, and honestly, it's hard to convey it in a way that's relatable to someone who isn't gay/lesbian/bi etc. But you absorb all the things you see growing up, even if you don't know yet that you aren't straight. You see what is common, what is \"okay\", and even what is condemned.  \nYour father probably *did* love your mother. You can love someone deeply and care about them, even if you're not attracted to them. Or he could have been attracted to her somewhat, too.  \nBut maybe after a period of time, there was still that feeling of emptiness and something missing, that he thought was just his fault. That he could fix by getting married, having kids. Because that's what we grow up learning will make us okay. It's the blueprint to happy.  \n\nOP, your father divorced your mother, not out of malice or because he was done using her. He divorced her because he realised that no matter how much he cared about her, or loved her, he couldn't fully love and care about her in the way she deserved to be loved as a wife. He divorced her because he finally realised what the empty feeling he had was.  \nWould it have been better for him to have stayed with your mother and pretend to love her like a straight man?  \n\nHe chose to uproot his entire life and even to lose you. That would have been incredibly painful for him. But he likely did so because he didn't want to lie to your mother. He didn't want to rob her of the opportunity to find someone who could love her like she deserves. And he didn't want to rob himself of the opportunity to be himself, either.  \n\nOP, I know that the divorce hurt you.  \nBut ask yourself this-  \nWould you feel differently about this situation if your father was straight?  \n\nBecause even if he was, that doesn't mean they wouldn't have divorced.  \nAnd your father had nothing to gain by pretending to be straight, marrying a woman, pretending to love her, having a child with her, and then divorcing her and not having primary custody. What does he gain from that? You said a child, but he barely saw you.   \n\nYou also mentioned your mother doesn't know about your current decision regarding your wedding.  \nI feel this situation is coming from your hurt about your father leaving, and some anger on behalf of your mother, but mostly your own.  \n\nAt the end of the day, it's your wedding, and it's your decision. You're 24, but this situation has brought you back to the 5 year old little girl who is hurt and scared.  \n\nYour father's only \"wrongdoing\" was divorcing your mother. Which was the right thing to do. Not doing so would have been using her and lying to her.  \nIt just doesn't feel that way, because it hurts.  \n\nI want to say YTA, and you are for blaming your father, but your wedding is up to you. So YTA for your behaviour to your father (as an adult now), NTA for who you invite to your wedding.", "YTA..they have been together for almost a decade.

It was only 19 years ago (about the time that your parents got divorced), that the first US state passed marriage equality. \n\nWhile it can be difficult for you to imagine, it is quite possible that your dad was trying to make the best of an unaccepting culture (and his own mixed emotions) at the time that he and your mom got married.", "YTA.

I loved my wife more than anything, she was the only person that i fell head over heels for. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce she came out shit went downhill, she didn't want a divorce she wanted to date around while  still married because she didn't want to be alone. she became abusive, hurt me physically and emotionally  and it culminated with me trying to jump off an over pass and being tackled by the cops and taken to the psychward. I'm glad she found her happiness but i wish i never met her. so to insinuate that the \"straight\" party just needs to get over it is gross. some of it doesn't just go away", "Yes but that leads to a situation where neither party is in the wrong and reddit needs their arguments", "Because I don't understand what they're asking exactly", "Not really. Are we sure dad didn\u2019t realize he was gay in the start? How was he using her? Unless he admitted to that\n\nEdit: spelling", "i don\u2019t think being in the closet is lying though. it\u2019s literally not knowing or being unwilling to admit that your gay for a fear of safety.", "Do we? Because many members of the  LGBTQ community realize much later in life.", "I visited him a couple times per year. I wasn't close to him as I mostly lived with my mom because he was living in another state.", "My dad is at least my dad, his partner isn't my family so if I have to invite someone I obviously will chose my dad", "I do think sexuality can be fluid and that especially in certain places it doesn't even cross people's mind that they may not be heterosexual and thus marry/date 'straight' for years. I don't think either person is at fault in these situations (sadly society is), but you can't deny that it does suck for the person 'left behind' and that resentment is a logical emotion", "It's possible the double standard is because his mom raised him and his dad, you know, didn't. Much easier to just pretend everyone is a bigot though, makes it all fit nearly in a box for you.\n\nDon't get advice if you can't do so without projecting butthurt everywhere.", "Being gay is not a crime, I don't think like that at all. I understand why my mom is hurt because he lied to her, that's different", "Yes, his crime of\u2026 Being gay.", "What did he (your dad) do to her? If he cheated on her (especially if current bf was the AP) I get that but if he just realised he was gay and broke stuff off with her this is not fair at all. Especially since it was 19 yrs ago", "You need therapy, not a wedding YTA", "What exactly did he do? You realize that not everyone realizes they are gay from birth right? You realize it can be a struggle right? You keep saying it's not a \"gay thing\"  but it totally comes off that it is. For some reason you see him being gay as a smite against your mom. It isn't.", "It has been so many years, if him bringing a partner is still a problem then that\u2019s something that needs to be taken up with a therapist, not Reddit. This is ridiculous. YTA", ">what he did to her\n\nSo far as I can tell, \"what he did to her\" was realize that he was in a relationship he didn't fit in. If that's a crime in your eyes then anyone who has ever ended a relationship is worthy of contempt.\n\nNo sir, this is about your own personal hang ups. You're holding your dad's sexual orientation against him and disguising it as offense for him maliciously harming your family.\n\nIf all he did was come out of the closet and end the straight relationship then you are indeed the asshole, and homophobic to boot.", "Mate it was ILLEGAL to be gay where i live up until the late 90s- in Australia. He probably convinced himself that he was straight, it happens! And it doesn't mean he set out to hurt anyone. My partner didn't realise he was bi till he was like 27.\n\nWould it make a difference to you if he had just have told her he didn't love her anymore and moved on with a woman?", " If she is still that hurt after nearly 20years and while in a new relationship then it sounds like your mom needs therapy.\n\nHas your mother actually voiced these concerns all have you decided on your lonesome that its best its your dads boyfriend stays away?", "Sure, Jan.\n\nAll of this is just you flailing around for justification to make yourself not look like the homophobe you are. If you (and your mom) are still this hung up on the fact that their relationship ended because of his sexuality, 20 years later, yall both need therapy.", "\u201cWhat he did to her\u201d being that he realized he was gay??\n\nYTA", "INFO\n\nWas this boyfriend around when he left your mom?\n\nBecause otherwise the boyfriend isn't a reminder of what he did.  You're taking it out on a guy because he's gay for something someone else did.  \n\nEither don't invite your father or give him the plus one.", "He left your mom for this guy?", "Yes it does. 2 decades\u2026.yes it does.", "But like what did he *do* to her? He figured out he\u2019s gay and left. Even if he cheated it has been NINETEEN YEARS dude. Your mom\u2019s new bf would be a reminder to him of heteronormative standards and how she\u2019s allowed to move on from this but he should\u2019ve apparently stayed in the closet his whole life or he should be punished for *checks notes* being gay.", "Are you OK with your dad potentially not coming to your wedding since you\u2019re not inviting his boyfriend?", "Yeah that is pretty disrespectful to his relationship.", "Dude, people have different perspectives and different takes on things that happen. That's conflict. Especially in divorce, there's seldom one person who is 100% right and one person who is 100% wrong. This is basic to understanding conflict. \n\nIt sounds like you heard your mom's take and never questioned it.", "Lol wait you have never once in your life gotten his side of the story? You've never talked to him about this?\n\nYTA and wildly homophobic", "I think what you may learn from your dad is the \u201cwhy\u201d of his life\u2026\n\nWhy he married your mom.\n\nWhy he (later?) realized he was gay.\n\nWhy he had to end things with your mom.\n\nBeing gay (and out) 20 years ago was much different than it is now. If you talk to your dad, you may be able to empathize with him and his journey to get a better perspective of what he\u2019s been through. I\u2019m guessing it would lead you to a place where his actions make more sense than \u201che just tricked my mom\u201d.\n\nI guess the question is: Would you like to gain a more well-rounded view of your dad or would you like to continue to view him as the villain of your mom\u2019s story?", "Because why would he even do that? It sounds so malicious and fake. It makes absolutely no sense as a story. Sounds like your dad was actually a victim in the marriage too because he spent a lot of time married to someone he later realized he couldn\u2019t fully love and be attracted to. That\u2019s really hard to go through.", "Maybe that he thought he was heterosexual when he married your mom and wasn't \"lying\" at all?", "Not really, if the Dad is bisexual then that just is the normal situation where the one who left for another person is still an asshole", "They're asking how you ***know*** he used your mother and lied.  \n\nIt's very common in older generations to not come to terms with your sexuality until later in life since it was so demonized.   Meaning he likely wasn't fully aware or accepting he was gay.  If that's the case then he didn't lie or use your mother.  \n\nSo how do you ***know*** what your mother feels is what actually happened?   You stated it as a fact that your father did those things, not that she just felt that way.  \n\n> She's hurt because he used her and lied to her when he didn't love her\n\nSo did he directly tell you those things?  You stated it as fact when you can't know that as fact without him directly telling you this.", "How do you know, for a fact, that your dad was knowingly lying?", "Exactly, no one knows apart from the dad and to some extent the mum. But OP has failed to have a grown up conversation to either of them about this and keeps using \u2018feelings\u2019 to justify the non invite to the boyfriend, however the dad is invited to the wedding. So OP either knows to do something socially correct by having dad walk the aisle or is also using the dad to look a certain way. Why on earth is her disdain is then extended to the boyfriend who is innocent in this situation I have no idea. Unless she is homophobic.", "Why was he living in another state? Do you know if he tried to get joint custody of you? I\u2019m guessing the courts wouldn\u2019t have granted much to a gay single dad.", "I'm planning my wedding right now.  \n\nNot giving a plus one to individually invited people is extremely rude - especially when you are doing it for your mother.  \n\nYou're doing it because he's gay.  \n\nEither don't invite your dad or give him the plus one.  Pick one of those options.", "The double standard is because he thinks that coming out as gay later in life is intentionally deceptive and a crime punishable by years of hatred and prejudiced treatment", "How do you know he lied to her rather than himself for decades?", "You know that it's entirely possible he didn't mean to lie to her, right? Like it is fully possible that he genuinely didn't realize that he was gay. Or that he fully believe that love and attraction would grow.\n\nYou genuinely have no fucking clue what being in the closet in a hateful society is like. Things were different back then, I was there.", "Agreed", "His mom too. This is pathetic.", "I wish I could upvote this more than once", "What other truth can he tell me? He lied and used her, there's no more than that. He knew he didn't liked women, but still married one\n\nI am genuinely asking because I can't imagine what else he would tell me that would change anything"]}
