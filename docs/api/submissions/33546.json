Of course me being a child my mom put it in a safe box to safe keep this was early 2000s\nLife went on I got out of my house because I went to college on another city and after almost 10 years later that I was gifted that bracelet it was still stored in the safe box one day my sister was looking trough my parents stuff and found the safe box, she put in the combination and opened it, while she las looking in the box she thought MY bracelet was cute so she took it and asked my mom if she could have it. My mom said yes and they just forgot about the issue.\nThe next weekend I come home and see my sister wearing my bracelet. Of course i got curios and asked where she got that from? With a huge smile on her face she said that my mom gave it to hear.\nI was really pissed of but kept my cool and went to ask my mom why should she give away something that clearly was not hers. Her answer til this day makes me angry she just blatantly stated \u201cYou never take care of things, I would never give you something like that even if it\u2019s yours because you would lose it or break it, you don\u2019t even like that stuff I don\u2019t know why you are making such a fuss\u201d\n\nAfter that I called both of them thief\u2019s and even today I still stand by it. Honestly I could care less about the bracelet but the way things where handled it just seems like they never even considered that since the item belonged to me they should have asked to me about it.\n\nI did like the bracelet and if I had been given an opportunity I would have worn it. TIL this day my sister still has the bracelet and my mom to make up for it has given me a bunch of gold jewelry\n\nHonestly the first earrings she gave me I just told her straight to her face that she could give me all the gold in the world and it would not matter cause the actions that she and my sister made just completely broke my relationship with both of them \n\nAfter the third gold item I asked her to please stop giving me this kinds of things because it still is uncomfortable for me than none of them has ever apologized for just taking something that wasn\u2019t theirs\n\nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1703232330, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18o9vi2/aita_for_calling_my_mom_and_sister_a_thief/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why can't she give the other jewelry to your sister instead?", "NTA. I would have gone low contact with them until the bracelet was returned. This is not about the value of the item. It is about the symbolism and connection with your god parents. It is the sentimental value.", "NTA. They really do not care what you think, because they only care about themselves. In this situation a normal sister would say, oh I'm so sorry, here, you have the bracelet back, mum never told me it was yours. And Mum would say Oh I'm so sorry, I quite forgot that it was yours, look I'll get it cleaned and polished. But no, the stolen goods stay where they are, and she gifts you stuff you don't want to force you to be grateful...", "NTA maybe you need space from them?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
