I\u2019ve prepped and cleaned basically all month so today I could just spot clean as needed and focus on cooking. We\u2019ll my husband decided he wanted to go hunting today. I told him if he wanted to go that\u2019s fine, but I need him to take our daughter with him (4F). He told me that I\u2019m being an asshole but ended up taking her anyway. I didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal, he\u2019s taken our daughter hunting with him twice this season to give me a much needed break. AITA for making him take her?\nEdit to add: I\u2019m not asking for your judgment about the right age for taking a child hunting or if hunting is good or bad. I\u2019m asking if I\u2019m the asshole for asking my husband to take our child (that he had previously agreed to watch so I can cook) out with him. \nEdit to add: their version of hunting together is them sitting in a truck and looking out the windows for any deer. The bow gets left in the bed of said truck in case one is found, where the four year old stays in the truck while dad shoots it. Then they drive said truck to get said deer and throw it in the back and take it to the shed. She\u2019s literally just there sitting in a truck with him. It\u2019s not a movie, we aren\u2019t give a child a gun or having her watch anything die. She\u2019s just there to chill with him.\n\nEdit to add again: this is what hunting looks like for them. They take the truck out into the field and wooden area on OUR PRIVATE property, where she stays strapped in her car seat the whole time. It\u2019s basically them just driving around until they see something, then it\u2019s my husband going and grabbing the bow from the bed of the truck and taking care of it. She isn\u2019t near any weapons, she isn\u2019t wandering the woods all Willy-nilly.
