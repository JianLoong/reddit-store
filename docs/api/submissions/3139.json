I\u2019ve prepped and cleaned basically all month so today I could just spot clean as needed and focus on cooking. We\u2019ll my husband decided he wanted to go hunting today. I told him if he wanted to go that\u2019s fine, but I need him to take our daughter with him (4F). He told me that I\u2019m being an asshole but ended up taking her anyway. I didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal, he\u2019s taken our daughter hunting with him twice this season to give me a much needed break. AITA for making him take her?\nEdit to add: I\u2019m not asking for your judgment about the right age for taking a child hunting or if hunting is good or bad. I\u2019m asking if I\u2019m the asshole for asking my husband to take our child (that he had previously agreed to watch so I can cook) out with him. \nEdit to add: their version of hunting together is them sitting in a truck and looking out the windows for any deer. The bow gets left in the bed of said truck in case one is found, where the four year old stays in the truck while dad shoots it. Then they drive said truck to get said deer and throw it in the back and take it to the shed. She\u2019s literally just there sitting in a truck with him. It\u2019s not a movie, we aren\u2019t give a child a gun or having her watch anything die. She\u2019s just there to chill with him.\n\nEdit to add again: this is what hunting looks like for them. They take the truck out into the field and wooden area on OUR PRIVATE property, where she stays strapped in her car seat the whole time. It\u2019s basically them just driving around until they see something, then it\u2019s my husband going and grabbing the bow from the bed of the truck and taking care of it. She isn\u2019t near any weapons, she isn\u2019t wandering the woods all Willy-nilly.

If you have weapons in the home the kids need to learn about them safely. I think 4 is fine for starting to learn about hunting and bows so no criticism there. My only critique would be that your husband agreed to watch your daughter while you cooked and he was irritated that he still had to do so when he changed his plans.

Every weekend she asks if they are going to go hunting. It\u2019s really not how I\u2019m thinking every one is seeing it as. They sit in a truck the whole time. She\u2019s not wandering the woods all Willy-bully. She\u2019s strapped in her car seat inside a warm vehicle.", "Sauce?", "But it\u2019s not for sport, it\u2019s for food.", "I went hunting with my cousin when i was 10 or 11 in ireland. It was birds or rabbits not big game. Id say younger go with there parents", "It had been previously agreed upon that he would watch her while I cook. Also it\u2019s his own child, I\u2019m not \u201cdropping\u201d her on him. He is also the parent. I shouldn\u2019t have to ask him to babysit for me.", "What? It sound like hubby spontaneously decided to go hunting after they agreed he would watch her.", "In that case, it seems like it's no problem for him to help out by taking her, especially since he already said he'd watch her so you could cook. Good luck today", "OP, I'm not anti-hunting at all.  But lots of people don't hunt, even if they're not against it.  Just saying they're \"going hunting\" is extremely vague to a ton of people, it does not detail the level of risk, the amount of physical activity, or how much attention your husband is able to pay to your daughter.  I was gonna err on the cautious side and say, yeah that sounds like a bad idea.  \n\nNow, 3 edits later, NTA and it sounds entirely reasonable.  But the sheer lack of information in your original post is probably the reason for a lot of kickback you might be getting on this, and I'm gonna say that's on you.", "I love this. I'm glad he has gotten her into it. I wonder if some would think differently if she were a boy", "Okay add a edit to put that. I come from a hunting family and they would let us rid wild. My brother ran off and trip in a hole breaking his leg. But as long as your family is being extra careful with her being a little it\u2019s fine.", "Let's face it. Nothing I actually say is going to change how you feel. And that's fine. Feel the way you feel. \n\nI am coming at it from the perspective that I lived this. Everyone has their own experience, though. I was fine seeing dead deer. It's not like it turned me into some gun toting murderer. It didn't scar me for life. I was taught gun safety young. I knew the dangers of weapons. I was never allowed to handle them alone without an adult helping me. That's just the way I (and many friends) grew up.", "Bruh this kid lives on a farm. With livestock. She\u2019d have more trauma seeing her parents randomly kill an animal at an older age than she will just growing up with it being a normal thing.", "That's good. Also there is a lot of complaining about hunting here. Don't forget about overpopulation people! An increase in breeding can lead to a reduce in resources. You don't have to like it , but sometimes a little intervention can be necessary. \n\nAs cute as deer are, they can be assholes. They ruin your crops and the last thing we need is more deer to hop into the roads and cause accidents. \n\nHunting can be a good thing as long as there isn't sadism in it. I highly doubt your husband is a sadist.", "This is good parenting. Children should know meat was an animal.", "These people obviously weren't raised on farms. Kids can understand responsible harvesting of meat means you have to kill it to cook it and eat it.", "You agree to take her and that he could go out.\n\nIf you\u2019re overwhelmed then tell him he can\u2019t go out. Problem solved.", "Yeah. I didn\u2019t anticipate the need for every detail of information. But I fixed that.", "Yeah.. I really hope these people against hunting are vegan. If you think hunting is bad they should go check out their local slaughterhouse and chicken plants. Then come back and tell me how shitty I am.", "HE AGREED TO TAKE HER. Homie\u2026 read the post. We had previously agreed that today he would be on daddy duty. He switched the game up last minute. Not me.", "Haha, I mean, I'm sure you'd agree there's a lot of hunting that gets done where you probably wouldn't want a 4 year old tagging along, and folks are gonna err on the side of child safety.  Nothing wrong with that.  Anyway, a lot of people just read the title and not the post, so you've got that too.", "I would take a family farm over the slaughterhouse anyway. Amen.", "Got it. Best of luck, homie."]}
