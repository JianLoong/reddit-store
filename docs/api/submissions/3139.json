I\u2019ve prepped and cleaned basically all month so today I could just spot clean as needed and focus on cooking. We\u2019ll my husband decided he wanted to go hunting today. I told him if he wanted to go that\u2019s fine, but I need him to take our daughter with him (4F). He told me that I\u2019m being an asshole but ended up taking her anyway. I didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal, he\u2019s taken our daughter hunting with him twice this season to give me a much needed break. AITA for making him take her?\nEdit to add: I\u2019m not asking for your judgment about the right age for taking a child hunting or if hunting is good or bad. I\u2019m asking if I\u2019m the asshole for asking my husband to take our child (that he had previously agreed to watch so I can cook) out with him. \nEdit to add: their version of hunting together is them sitting in a truck and looking out the windows for any deer. The bow gets left in the bed of said truck in case one is found, where the four year old stays in the truck while dad shoots it. Then they drive said truck to get said deer and throw it in the back and take it to the shed. She\u2019s literally just there sitting in a truck with him. It\u2019s not a movie, we aren\u2019t give a child a gun or having her watch anything die. She\u2019s just there to chill with him.\n\nEdit to add again: this is what hunting looks like for them. They take the truck out into the field and wooden area on OUR PRIVATE property, where she stays strapped in her car seat the whole time. It\u2019s basically them just driving around until they see something, then it\u2019s my husband going and grabbing the bow from the bed of the truck and taking care of it. She isn\u2019t near any weapons, she isn\u2019t wandering the woods all Willy-nilly.

Why are you hosting Thanksgiving alone, when you are half of a couple?", "If factory farm meat was the only choice I had (we have a mini farm and supplement with hunting and fishing) I would be vegetarian also though to be honest. Those animals have no quality of life, they're treated poorly from the time they enter the earth to when they leave it. I can easily understand why they don't want to eat it. I have a belief that the mistreated they receive can be passed to you. I know it sounds whacky. \n\nI can understand that some people can't end a life either, but for me personally I feel it to be dishonest to be disconnected from my food. I feel like if I'm going to eat it I should have the responsibility and the sadness of the whole process so that I can properly respect what I've been given.\n\nNothing saddens me more than people throwing meat out after over buying because it went bad. That was life, you should've respected it and only took what you needed. \n\nLol I think I rambled enough on that. Sorry!", "Yeah I have zero desire to hunt and would never want to do it myself, but the folks I know who do care deeply about the environment and sustainability and \u201ccarry the weight\u201d if you will that it is actually another living being and not simply an animal.", "Don\u2019t apologize for passion, especially when it concerns life! Nothing to be sorry for. I understand what you mean, life is filled with transfers of energy. I love how you think. I believe that all living animals, plants, and fungi contain a type of personhood and our world would be much better off if we all understood that.\n\n(edit to say: my adhd addled brain just word vomited below, good luck)\n\nYou\u2019re living the life I dream of! I had my first outdoor garden this year and it was so rewarding! Have you always lived like that or was it a gradual process?\n\nI think its really cool that they are plant-based but not fanatical and open to eating an animal that had a respected death. I stopped eating meat due to environmental and animal rights, but towards the end of my time as a vegetarian any kind of restricted eating triggered my ED and was underweight.\n\nI eat a lot of plant-based meals but still go to a butcher in hopes that the animals I eat were treated better. I\u2019ve only ever fished as my uncles never took me hunting. I\u2019ve lived with the hypocrisy that I thought I could never kill to eat, but as I get older I would really like to try hunting. My portaging trip was cancelled due to a wildfire but I was really looking forward to eating what I fished. For hunting, I fear it\u2019s too late for me to learn (I say this like being in my mid20s is a death sentence lol) with the barrier to entry being high.", "Fellow Canadian who lives in a Native American reserve where it\u2019s not uncommon to take kids out into the bush to hunt. \n\nIt\u2019s not traumatizing at all, the only thing I had against it was having to hop in my brothers or uncles shoe prints because I was tiny and had little legs. And I wasn\u2019t allowed to touch the gun and the gun always had its safety on unless there was a moose around. \n\nI learned how to track, where my food came from, how important it is not to let the animal suffer, how to skin, cut and preserve. And I learned how bloody hard it actually is to bring a huge animal home just to feed not only me - but my fellow community members, because in my culture the first fish or hunt is always shared.\n\nUnlike OPs daughter, our children ride the ATVs / snowmobile or if they\u2019re big enough they walk. No one\u2019s ever died or suffered and no one came home traumatized.", "Fellow Canadian who lives in a Native American reserve where it\u2019s not uncommon to take kids out into the bush to hunt. \n\nIt\u2019s not traumatizing at all, the only thing I had against it was having to hop in my brothers or uncles shoe prints because I was tiny and had little legs.

I'm gonna go ahead and say no, you haven't.", "Pigs will eat each other without much issue if you let them. They eat... well just about anything vaguely edible", "NTA but he should\u2019ve been helping you more than just by parenting.", "We both are. I love my hubs, and many won\u2019t get the relationship. But I\u2019m the homemaker he\u2019s the farmer. He keeps up with the maintenance and upkeep of our \u201chomestead\u201d and I take care of the household chores. Though I also provide income outside of farming, but that\u2019s like a hobby that I make money off of. \nAlso love the dude, but we\u2019ve been together since we were teenagers, we moved out our parents house and in together, he never really learned to cook (outside some of my favorite meals) he isn\u2019t touching my feast. \ud83d\ude02", "You need to stop with the \u201ccity folk\u201d bashing. I live in a city. But I understand that Homo sapiens is an apex predator. Meat fed our large brains and our large brains allowed us to use animals for food, shelter and clothing. The two are inextricable. Now we even use animals to generate new knowledge. You\u2019re NTA, but stop making generalizations about people based on where they live.", "Many times it's a population control move. To prevent starvation and disease.", "I dont know really any other way of living because this is the way I was raised, grew up near packwood forest (loggers by trade, the whole family) and roamed around the Eatonville/yelm/Roy area. It was very important to my dad that we were self sustaining as there's a pretty heavy lack of trust for government in our culture.\n\nWe were never allowed, nor wanted to, take pictures of our hunts. They aren't trophies, they're gifts. And we always tried to avoid disrespecting the animal after downing them. We don't rest our rifles or bows on the animal because it wasn't a fair fight. \n\nAs for the animals I raise, we give them the most love and comfort possible for their lives knowing full well that I will have to harvest them. Just because you're going to be food doesn't mean their lives shouldn't be valued. There's no real way to harvest an animal with no guilt, and if there is there's a problem but we do our best to be as honorable as possible.\n\nAnd it's never too late to learn how to reconnect yourself with not just nature but who we were. There's a real comfort to knowing that at the very least, no matter what happens, you can feed yourself.", "Pigs are omnivores."]}
