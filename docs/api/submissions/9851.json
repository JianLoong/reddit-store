{"id": 9851, "submission_id": "111altx", "title": "AITA for leaving my boyfriend and his friends behind after agreeing to be the designated driver?", "selftext": "My (33F) boyfriend (33M) of four years is a big football fan and he has a tradition of meeting up with his high school friends at a bar for Super Bowl every year.  It\u2019s often the only time in a year he gets to see some of these friends because they\u2019re busy with their families and life. \n\nI don\u2019t like football, so I\u2019m happy to be able to drop him off somewhere, have an evening to myself and pick him up when he\u2019s ready to come home. He tends to go hard with the alcohol when he\u2019s out with this group. \n\nLast night, my boyfriend texted me that he was almost ready to be picked up, so I headed to the bar. He wasn\u2019t as ready as he made it seem, so I ended up going in and sitting down with them while everyone finished their round of drinks. \n\nHe was pretty drunk and he started getting handsy in a way that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with out in public. So I politely asked him to stop. I didn\u2019t want to make a scene so I leaned in to whisper in his ear asking to stop. He got angry and whispered back \u201cYou should consider yourself lucky that I\u2019m going home with you. I could go home with any woman here if I wanted to.\u201d (He couldn\u2019t but he\u2019s always been a dreamer lol) \n\nI was taken aback as he\u2019s never said anything like that to me before. I get he was drunk but still. Anger set in and I excused myself as if I was going to the bathroom. I ended up leaving and texted him to let him know I left. \n\nUnfortunately, he had arranged for me to drive two of his friends home too. Wouldn\u2019t have been an issue but he also hadn\u2019t communicated that with me. Instead of calling an Uber or Taxi like I assumed he would, one of his friends called his wife. The wife had to wake their toddler up to go and pick them up. \n\nMy boyfriend was furious when he came home and still is this morning. He slept on the couch and we had an argument before he left for work. He says I embarrassed him by just up and leaving. He vehemently denies saying what he did, doesn\u2019t recall getting handsy and insists he wasn\u2019t \u201cthat drunk\u201d last night.\n\nI also got an angry text from the wife saying I was an asshole for leaving them drunk and stranded - forcing her to wake up her toddler to go and pick them up. She also had a vague passive-aggressive Facebook post up calling me out. \n\nNow I\u2019m questioning whether I overreacted. Maybe I should have just brushed off his comment because he was drunk and followed through on the commitment I made. I just felt so disrespected by what he said after I asked him to stop doing something that was making me uncomfortable. \n\nSo, AITA for leaving my drunk boyfriend and his friends stranded after the Super Bowl?", "created_utc": 1676299473, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111altx/aita_for_leaving_my_boyfriend_and_his_friends/", "score": 422, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then you'd be an AH to yourself.\n\nHe caused the first issue by asking you to get him and then disrespecting you by not being ready when you got there. You were very accommodating to stay as long as you did. Strike one.\n\nThen he made you uncomfortable and told you that you should be grateful for it? Because he could just leave you? That's 100% him being an AH. Strike two.\n\nThen he has the audacity to be angry with you, denying how big an asshole he was, and failing to defend you to his friends and friend's wife? (She's justifiably upset, and no doubt was lied to about why you left - she's upset with the wrong person, but that's your \"boyfriend's\" fault).  Strike three.\n\nI'm sure you could list some sort of nice qualities he has that wouldn't be mentioned here. I don't see how they would redeem his disrespect.", "NTA. You didn't even know others were planning on you to give them a ride. Hold your ground that what your BF did and said last night was totally inappropriate, disrespectful, and unacceptable. Even signing you up to bring others home without telling you is in itself somewhat disrespectful of you. It's unfortunate but actually probably very fortunate that you've gotten this glimpse into who he is when he has the social lubrication of the alcohol. Do not accept anything less than an apology from him and make it clear that treatment will not be tolerated in the future. This assumes he has a very positive track record and that this is not indicative of a pattern of behavior or attitude toward you.\n\nConsider responding to the other wife something along the lines of \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience that the boys caused you last night. I had no idea I was expected to bring anyone home but my BF. It doesn't seem as if they can handle this type of night out so hopefully they arrange transport in the future.\"", "NTA. Growing up with an alcoholic teaches you that what they say when they are drunk is what they really think all the time. Just now the filters are gone and they say it. Sick of people excusing drunk people saying awful crap. The booze didn't create the words. The booze set them free.", "NTA. Apparently any woman there would have happily driven him home. I\u2019m sure she would have made a few extra stops, just out of pure gratitude and delight.", "NTA. And why couldn\u2019t they take a Lyft? If they can afford all those drinks (and likely food) in the bar then they can afford a Lyft. It is NOT on you that the woman had to wake her toddler. \n\n  Are you happy with boyfriend? He should believe you that he did those things.", "NTA - Being his DD doesn't give him a free pass to disrespect you.  They can take an Uber.\n\nAnd I think people's true inner personalities come out when they're drunk.", "If my partner ever spoke to me like that after i explicitly told them not to touch me in a way I didn\u2019t find appropriate, drunk or not, I\u2019d have caused a scene by swinging. \n\nIt\u2019s also common courtesy to tell your Designated Driver beforehand, who exactly is going to be in the car and actually be READY to leave when they either arrive for pick up or when the DD is ready to leave. Having a DD is a privilege, not a goddamn right. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not on you that one of his buddies woke up their wife for pick up, there\u2019s readily available services for that like you said, including the already half-assed plan with you he made. He shouldn\u2019t have acted like a drunk jerk  and put you in a situation where you were uncomfortable and disrespected.\n\nI\u2019d have a serious talk to your boyfriend about this, don\u2019t let him brush away his actions by blaming it on the alcohol or him not remembering it. Whether he realises it or not, he\u2019s crossed a boundary he shouldn\u2019t have and he needs to know there\u2019s consequences for it. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend acted like a dick then tried to use the *but I wasn\u2019t even that drunk so it didn\u2019t happen* excuse. Just tell everybody the truth. He was being a gross pervert so you left. \n\nAre you sure you want to be with a man like this?", "You\u2019re NTA. He has no right to speak to you that way or grope you in public. Break up with him. He can\u2019t even own up to his behavior. The friend\u2019s wife is an asshole too, overreacting and dramatically posting on SM without context.", "NTA\nYou did not overreact. He tried to touch you in a sexual manner when you clearly were not consenting, and said you should be grateful for the mistreatment of you. His behavior is a red flag, and I would refuse to be around him when he drinks if it causes him to sexually harass you.", "NTA. You have every right to respect your boundaries, then ditching him to find another ride is reasonable as he was clearly wasted. As you say, there are taxis available.  \n\nAlso it is abusive to tell your partner that you should be grateful for their affection and that he could pull anyone at the pub.", "NTA, and your boy has a drinking problem if he doesn\u2019t remember shit. \n\nAlso, contrary to some of the comments here, you don\u2019t owe anyone shit. You were doing him a favor. You don\u2019t lose your right to tell him to fuck off just bc you were doing him that favor. So ungrateful.", "NTA. Okey you agreed to be the DD but that doesn't mean you need to accept everything the drunk person says or does.  If he was handsy and stopped after you told him, oke great get him home and talk about it when he sobers up. But he completely disregard your boundary. Being drunk doesn't excuse him from being an asshole. They also could've called a taxi or something", "NTA for leaving the friends. You didn't know you were supposed to drive other people so that is nothing to do with you. \n\nAs for what your boyfriend said, I think that's an issue and you have every right to be pissed off. In my experience, alcohol doesn't make you say things you don't mean. It removes the filter and makes you more likely to say things you might not say otherwise but that are honest.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nAlcohol doesn't excuse bad behaviour. He got drunk, did something you didn't like, you asked him to stop and he didn't. Not only did he not stop, but he then got mean about it. You were entirely right to leave him there. The fact he didn't mention giving his friends a lift, which should have been asked before you even set off, doesn't make you the asshole for his wife having to come out either. That just makes your boyfriend a bigger asshole.\n\nHonestly, unless he comes up with a big apology and acknowledges his behaviour, I'd consider how serious this relationship is. If that's how he behaves when he drinks and this is a tradition, do you really want to be putting up with this repeatedly forever? \n\nYour boyfriend is the asshole, not you.", "NTA\n\nWhat he said was totally uncalled for and I don't care how long you have been together - if someone says to stop touching them, you stop.  Being drunk is never an excuse to be mean or continuing unwanted physical advances. \n\nHe could have just as easily called an Uber or Lyft - their texting the wife and having her wake the toddler is their fault. They are the AH's for that, not you.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, the wife would have gotten a message back letting her know about the situation. \n\nOP, your boyfriend doesn\u2019t respect you and sounds like an alcoholic. I would do some thinking about how healthy this \u201crelationship\u201d is.", "NTA. I would respond to the wife, saying that you had not agreed to drive the other two home. That was done without your knowledge or consent, but that you are sorry they called her . You were simply refusing to drive your drunk boyfriend home after he was disrespectful and you knew he could get an Uber.", "i just... honestly don't get what's appealing about a 33 year old man who still gets drunk enough to act like this in public. i get that we live in a society that worships alcohol, but like... he's 33. the time for drunk antics was about 10 years ago.", "NTA. You didn't leave his friends stranded, he did. He didn't tell you that you were supposed to take them home, too. And he was acting wildly inappropriate towards you, so I completely understand why you didn't want to give him a ride.\n\nNews flash, though. Although people might tell you differently, alcohol doesn't change who a person is on the inside. If your boyfriend is telling you, \"I could go home with any woman here,\" while he is drunk, I promise you, he believes this. Take it to heart.", "NTA. And the guy\u2019s wife didn\u2019t have to come either. Although given how obnoxious this group is, some Uber driver likely dodged a bullet. \n\nAlso- get rid of the boyfriend. This is likely tip of the iceberg.", "NTA - you need to dump this guy, for real.", "NTA - this guy seems to have self-confidence issues. Although you apparently made him angry by not honoring the deal and the whole situation could have been handled differently (that is without involving the wife and her toddler) he shouldn't have denied or even downplayed his comments and behaviour. Furthermore, if you knew there are other people relying on you to get home you might have stayed and got hem all home. He did not provide this information. \n\nThe fact that he denies his inappropriate behaviour and what he said the previous night also speaks volumes. \n\nIf this is first time of him not respecting boundaries and making such comments I would talk to him. If he shows similar behaviour of disrespect towards you and attempts of gaslighting, you shouldn't have to deal with that.", "NTA\n\nJust msg the wife and tell her what happened and apologize. She can either accept it or not. \n\nIf he was too drunk to remember being handsy or what he said, it's best that he slept on the couch anyway. That's a situation ripe for a very bad outcome if he got frisky, you said no, and he wouldn't take the no for an answer. \n\nPersonally, I would have left too. If he can't handle drinking any better than that, then maybe he shouldn't be drinking.", "NTA. If someone said that to me, they would be an ex instantly. Alcohol is truth serum so now you know how much respect he has for you. As for the other people he promised a ride to; since you didn\u2019t know about that or had made any promises, you had 0 responsibility to be their ride. They should\u2019ve gotten Ubers or taxis, it\u2019s not your fault they\u2019re inconsiderate AH\u2019s.", "NTA. \n\nI'm more than happy to DD for people, but I have ground rules:\n\n1. I need to know who I'm driving\n\n2. Everyone needs to fit in the car and wear a seat belt\n\n3. I'm not making extra stops or picking up extra people.\n\nI would have ditched your boyfriend, too.\n\nYour boyfriend and I are roughly the same age, and I can tell you, as a former bartender, he's very unlikely to ever grow up. I used to see men in their 50s and 60s acting like this with their wives, sometimes in front of their kids. If he's diminishing his behavior with \"I don't remember\" and \"I wasn't _that_ drunk\" then he doesn't want to grow up. DTMFA.", "NTA for sure. BFs comment was very demeaning and if he can't remember saying that he should not drink. Being drunk is not a pass for assholery. \n\nI am curious why the BF & friends did not take an uber or similar service? Waking the other lady *and* her toddler is also a big AH move unless there were safety concerns (they were in a crime prone area etc..)", "NTA\n\nIn vino veritas.\n\nI would give this relationship some serious thought.\n\nP.s.  He either was so blackout drunk that he actually doesn't remember or he's gaslighting you,  doesn't look good no matter which one you pick...", "NTA, you gave him a chance by going into the bar and waiting for him. When he got handsy and lippy with you, you made the correct decision by leaving his drunk ass there. \n\nHis friends are collateral damage and not worth a second of arguing over. They would have had to find their own ways home anyway.", "NTA\n\nHe felt you up without consent, he then proceeded to verbally abuse you, and while he might have actually been blackout drunk, I\u2019d be willing to wager that\u2019s not the case and he gaslit you about what he said last night. You need to look at this series of event and evaluate your relationship. Has he done this before or is this new behavior? People say they don\u2019t act like themselves when they\u2019re drunk, but oftentimes they\u2019re acting like their true selves. Don\u2019t worry about the other guy\u2019s wife. She could have told them to call an uber too. This is on the drunk idiots who didn\u2019t think.", "Comment on her FB post and make sure the entire world knows what your husband said to you and that he decided you would do something that he never told you about. They\u2019re 30 year old men, not children. I\u2019m assuming the friends wife is also an adult and not a freaking child. They know how to call a cab. NTA. Your husband fucked around and found out. But seriously though, what he said is very reflective of the amount of respect he has for you, so please do what you can to love yourself, and prioritize yourself over him right now. Don\u2019t let him guilt trip you into backing down when he\u2019s the one that messed up", "NTA. Stand your ground. He said what he said and it wasn't nice. If you maintain your stance, he will learn that you are not to be trifled with. Ignore the wife of his friend.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know he had promised other people a ride from you (which was rude of him). Tell his wife this, and if she doesn\u2019t accept that it\u2019s on her.\n\nRemind your BF that when if he was drunk enough that he doesn\u2019t remember what he did, it doesn\u2019t make what he did disappear. He was an AH to you and you didn\u2019t deserve that, and unless he wants to be single again he may want to consider how alcohol is affecting his behavior. Likewise he needs to think about promising taxi service to others in the future without consulting you first and how disrespectful that is.", "NTA - please consider leaving him. He doesn\u2019t treat you with respect and you deserve better. Maybe reach out to the wife afterwards and tell her what an ass your ex is.", "NTA.\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is a grade-A asshole though. He volunteered you for something without telling you. He wasn't ready when he told you he would be. He touched you inappropriately in public. He insinuated that he could be unfaithful at the snap of his fingers and it would be only what you deserved for complaining about his inappropriate touching. You had had enough. Donezo.\n\nThe wife is a slight ass for making the nasty text and the shady Facebook post but she likely doesn't know the whole story and were I in her shoes I would be as pissed as she is as well without the additional information. Perhaps you could gently text her back and get her to direct her ire to the appropriate person - your boyfriend.", "Your bf SA'd you. You need to leave this relationship immediately.\n\nNTA and please get out.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is an alcoholic.", "NTA bit your bf has no respect for you.", "NTA \n\nYour mistake was you sat down, you should have gone in, said you were here to pick him up and it\u2019s now or a taxi\n\nBut his way of acting towards you was not okay, next year if you are still a couple, tell him to get someone else to drive\n\nThe wife calling you out is not your fault, it was her drunk husband, normal people would have called a taxi or Uber", "NTA. He groped you and verbally abused you. He's either got a drinking problem and needs to address that, or he's got an abuse problem and needs to address that. I had a boyfriend who did pretty much the same thing but actually hurt me before I left.\n\nAlso, that wife didn't have to wake up her toddler and get them. She DIDN'T have to. They could have called a ride home. Not your fault and she's petty for trying to make it seem that way.", "NTA - but you\u2019re under reacting. Your bfs behavior is a really big deal.", "NTA. It sounds like he was threatening to cheat on you if you didn't comply with him being handsy.\n\nThere were plenty of options other than calling the wife. He's an idiot.", "NTA. I personally would die on this hill. He was incredibly disrespectful and no amount of alcohol justifies that.", "NTA. Your boyfriend was being a dick. He doesn't respect you, if he thinks making such a shitty comment to you is okay. And then to double down & make you the bad guy? Hell no. I think that you need to decide if this is the kind of person that you want to spend your life with. Because the shitty treatment is only going to get worse.", "NTA.\n\nHim denying how he acted is a little concerning honestly. The way he acted was also way out of line, and I understand that you left.\n\nAs you said, they could've just called a taxi/uber, so I fail to see how you're responsible for the wife having to wake up the toddler. It was her decision to get them, and she should've told them to just get a taxi.", "NTA - major red flags", "*Just because he claims he doesn\u2019t remember, doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen.* He showed you who he is. Now it\u2019s up to *you* to decide if you\u2019re going to accept it, or take him up on his word and let him see how many better options he has./s", "The booze didn't create the words. The booze set them free.", "NTA and that c other woman is an idiot.

You\u2019re still you when you\u2019re drunk. You don\u2019t become another person. Just an unfiltered and uninhibited you. And the mom who is trying to shame you? WTF? She too could have said no. Her husband thought it was appropriate to wake her and his toddler to get his and his friends drunk asses home? Disgusting. They were watching a game. At a bar.

He wasn't ready to go when he said he was ready to go and made you wait. He volunteered you to drive his friends without asking you. He behaved inappropriately in the bar.

Why she cant tell her 2nd child that if he is old enough to drink then hes old enough to get an uber home is totally beyond me tbh. Maybe comment on her fb post just like \"sorry you had to step up and parent your 2nd child, but I am not a certified childcare provider xx\" that would not help but it might make you feel better.\n\nSecondly, you didnt over react. Who even drunk says smth like that to their partner that they chose and that they love?\n\n*He got angry and whispered back \u201cYou should consider yourself lucky thatI\u2019m going home with you.

It\u2019s often the only time in a year he gets to see some of these friends because they\u2019re busy with their families and life. \n\nI don\u2019t like football, so I\u2019m happy to be able to drop him off somewhere, have an evening to myself and pick him up when he\u2019s ready to come home. He tends to go hard with the alcohol when he\u2019s out with this group. \n\nLast night, my boyfriend texted me that he was almost ready to be picked up, so I headed to the bar. He wasn\u2019t as ready as he made it seem, so I ended up going in and sitting down with them while everyone finished their round of drinks. \n\nHe was pretty drunk and he started getting handsy in a way that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with out in public. So I politely asked him to stop. I didn\u2019t want to make a scene so I leaned in to whisper in his ear asking to stop. He got angry and whispered back \u201cYou should consider yourself lucky that I\u2019m going home with you. I could go home with any woman here if I wanted to.\u201d (He couldn\u2019t but he\u2019s always been a dreamer lol) \n\nI was taken aback as he\u2019s never said anything like that to me before. I get he was drunk but still. Anger set in and I excused myself as if I was going to the bathroom. I ended up leaving and texted him to let him know I left. \n\nUnfortunately, he had arranged for me to drive two of his friends home too. Wouldn\u2019t have been an issue but he also hadn\u2019t communicated that with me. Instead of calling an Uber or Taxi like I assumed he would, one of his friends called his wife. The wife had to wake their toddler up to go and pick them up. \n\nMy boyfriend was furious when he came home and still is this morning. He slept on the couch and we had an argument before he left for work. He says I embarrassed him by just up and leaving. He vehemently denies saying what he did, doesn\u2019t recall getting handsy and insists he wasn\u2019t \u201cthat drunk\u201d last night.\n\nI also got an angry text from the wife saying I was an asshole for leaving them drunk and stranded - forcing her to wake up her toddler to go and pick them up. She also had a vague passive-aggressive Facebook post up calling me out. \n\nNow I\u2019m questioning whether I overreacted. Maybe I should have just brushed off his comment because he was drunk and followed through on the commitment I made. I just felt so disrespected by what he said after I asked him to stop doing something that was making me uncomfortable. \n\nSo, AITA for leaving my drunk boyfriend and his friends stranded after the Super Bowl?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Dangerous things can happen to drunk people so designated driver duties are an important responsibility in a lot of people's minds.", "I know. Wild take from people.", "It\u2019s quite unfortunate how common this is on Reddit/everyday life. OP is definitely NTA here", "No one said sexually assaulted. Apparently the dude was getting frisky, she told him where the line was as he stopped. And of course you should talk to your partner about things that make you uncomfortable.", "Getting handsy and being obnoxious are now SA and abuse. Well, if she feels that way, she should call the police and have him arrested. \n\nAt least he would have had a ride \ud83d\ude02", "She's not married.", "[removed]", "Yeah I see what you\u2019re saying.\n\nEdit: This was not my original comeback. I don't have a ton of experience yet on reddit. I was ashamed of my original comeback so I took it down. I didn't realize it was going to come off as me trying to make anyone look bad. Now I see I could have just originally typed the edit out instead.", "Only some times.", "Agreed. In a drunk stupor, you threaten our relationship by telling me you have options...I'm going to call out your BS and see if one of those options can get you home safe. NTA.", "You're right. He might be, but there's no way of knowing that, based on what is in the post. Anyone saying that he is an alcoholic is just guessing.", "I am a recovering alcoholic and if they black out every time they drink they absolutely have a drinking problem, alcoholics don\u2019t have to drink everyday to be an alcoholic.  What makes an alcoholic is how their body reacts to the alcohol when it is consumed.  If they cannot stop when they start, they crave it, etc", "I disagree. Drinking so much you black out is not what I would call a healthy relationship with alcohol.", "She needs to tell that wife that she wasn't even asked to take her hubby or anyone else home!", "Really? My sheets preferred to be lied on rather than lied to.", "I read the above comment as if the wife is trying to shame OP on Facebook, OP should shame her back for waking up a toddler and subjecting him/her to riding around with 3 drunk men instead of telling the husband to figure it out.", "Touching someone without consent is sexual assault. And his response to being asked to stop was to verbally abuse her, which is equally unacceptable.", "He did not have affirmative consent to grope her in a *public place*. \n\nShe told him to stop and he threatened to cheat on her if she didn't comply, which is a clear coercive technique.\n\nIf you don't think there's something wrong with that, you need to educate yourself on affirmative consent immediately before you end up in prison yourself.", "omg. so sorry. *boyfriend* it\u2019s obviously all okay then since they\u2019re not married /s", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Having sex with someone doesn't give them blanket consent to do whatever they want. He also hadn't told her she was driving his friends home.\n\nedit: nice editing your entire comment after the fact like you didn't say because she has sex with him it's not sexual assault.", "Assault is assault, regardless of the relationship involved, and you rolling your eyes and scoffing is vile. Being in a relationship with someone doesn't give them the right to touch you without permission, period. Uber exists, cabs exist, he's not a helpless child and OP doesn't owe his drunk friends a ride she didn't agree to just because they weren't responsible enough to figure out their own transportation.", "Wow that stealth edit was really not ok.", "No, always.", "Excellent point. Boyfriend said he could have any woman in that bar. How come he didn't have one of these women, then, when he needed a ride?", "And usually that involves drinking heavily not just once a year\u2026 from the information given in this post that seems to be the trend. Once a year he sees these friends and goes a little too hamm. Alcoholics don\u2019t do that once a year.", "Where does it say that OP\u2019s boyfriend blacks out every time he drinks?", "Laid*", "The wife was in a bad situation and was probably lied to about OP.\n\nOP doesn't need to shame her, but merely clarify what happened. The wife can think what she wants, but the men were the ones behaving badly", "Cringe. I touch my girlfriend all the time and she does the same to me. I never ask \"can I touch you please?\".\n\nSure, without any context his response sounds idiotic. But what a sad emotionless universe it would be if I had to ask my girlfriend to touch her. \n\nShe was uncomfortable, she said so. Good for her. Nothing bad happened. The only crime was a lame line he said afterwards.", "If you read even one of my comments in the thread, you would know that was not the point of the correction.", "Yes after rereading the post your correct so my bad. I\u2019ve been through both types of situations myself and neither is pleasant so I rethought what I wrote and decided I was wrong. Sorry I made a mistake and corrected it \u270c\ufe0f", "What I said was wrong. I apologize. I feel bad. It wasn\u2019t right. I\u2019m incorrect. I\u2019ve had a partner get handsy with me when I didn\u2019t want it. I\u2019ve been sexually assaulted when I was 10 by a trusted family friend. In my experience number 2 was worse than number one. But none of it was ok. So again. What I typed was not ok. It was wrong. I was wrong. I am sorry.", "If you sing a contract when drunk it can be voided.", "That was the joke, friend.", "My sheets prefer to be laid on rather than laid to. Is that better?", "Wife is the one who chose to both send a text berating OP AND make a post about it on Facebook. That\u2019s not mature behavior regardless of what she was told.", "What's \"cringe\" is justifying coercion. She said no and he literally threatened her.\n\nLearn about and practice affirmative consent.", "There's a difference between casually touching someone in an acceptable setting and feeling them up in public. There are also nonverbal ways to convey consent. And the correct response to making someone uncomfortable isn't to guilt trip them and insinuate that you could just do the same thing to someone else. That \"lame line\" is manipulative and abusive in this context, no extra info is necessary.", "I still don\u2019t know the point of your correction as it literally does not matter if they\u2019re married or not  it changes nothing.", "By covering up what you said", "So delete your original comment which is still out there instead of stealth editing to make everybody around you look bad? It's not that hard.", "Yeah, singing u is usually not a legally bindung agreement.", "Sure whatever, I'll give you the manipulative lame line.\n\nBut some people like to tease in public. Are you kink shaming? Oh wow", "It was literally just a correction for clarity. Some people might not understand who you were referring to because the only \"husband\" in the situation is the husband of the facebook woman. So referring to the 'husband' creates confusion in reading your comment.\n\nChill.", "What I said was wrong. I apologize. I feel bad. It wasn\u2019t right. I\u2019m incorrect. I\u2019ve had a partner get handsy with me when I didn\u2019t want it. I\u2019ve been sexually assaulted when I was 10 by a trusted family friend. Sorry if I\u2019m my mind number 2 was worse than number one. But none of it was ok. So again. What I typed was not ok. It was wrong. I was wrong. I am sorry.", "That was not at all what I was doing. I have only been on Reddit for a short amount of time and am not on social media all that much so I am still learning about editing. I didn't realize that it was going to make anyone look bad and that is not what I was trying to do.", "What I am trying to say is not all the time. Binding contracts can be voided if you are drunk and the other party is not. This is independent of the ops Post.", "Once again, kink involves consent. Please learn about and practice consent because it's alarming how little you seem to understand about it.\n\nStop moving the goalposts.", "If it were a kink, it would have been discussed and agreed upon by both parties. Kink doesn't give you an automatic pass and in fact necessitates a HIGHER level of communication and consent.", "No worries. It's understandable then. There are people around here that edit comments in bad faith, so sorry for assuming the worst and jumping down your throat about it.", "That's because in that case you are the likely victim. You are still responsible for crimes and offenses you commit, such as touching your gf when she tells you not to and insulting her.", "Being drunk does not absolve you of sexual assault, which is the entire point of this post. Stop derailing.", "She's been here for 6 months, hard to believe she didn't know better.", "Thank you I really do appreciate your understanding and I learned something new about reddit. I will not do this again and I truly appreciate your understanding that I was not trying to make you or anyone else look bad.", "Like I said this is only refuting your claim of always.", "Meh. It costs nothing to extend people grace.", "Which only serves your pedantry and does absolutely nothing to further the relevant conversation."]}
