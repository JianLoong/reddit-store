I love to paint. It\u2019s just a fun hobby that I use as my own version of therapy. Anytime I feel overwhelmed or particularly frustrated, I pour those emotions into a new painting and feel much better after it\u2019s finished. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m the next Bob Ross or anything, but I like my paintings and my friends and family always compliment them. I have about 15 of them hanging up around my apartment in various places. My boyfriend, J, has always said how cool he thought the paintings were and has never tried to discourage me from putting them up all over the place. \r  \n\r  \nAbout a week ago, J said he would like to host dinner with his friends at the apartment. They\u2019ve never been over, and he thought it would be a good opportunity for his friends and I to get to know each other better. I agreed and was happy to cook, make drinks, and host. I immediately started planning what I was going to make and asking J if there were any dietary restrictions that his friends have. He stopped me in my tracks and told me he had one request to make before he confirmed with his friends. He asked me if I would take all my paintings down for the evening and put them in our bedroom. When I pressed him for why he would want me to do that, he shrugged his shoulders and said they might make his friends uncomfortable. \r  \n\r  \nNow my paintings are an expression of my negative emotions, so as you can imagine they lean toward the dark and macabre. They aren\u2019t by any means pretty landscapes or bright flowers, but they are still my art and very personal to me. If the goal of the dinner is to get to know each other more, I would think they are a great conversation piece and show a lot of insight into who I am and what I like to do. J argued with me saying they are \u201ctwisted and sick\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t want his friends to think I\u2019m some sort of mental case. I had no idea he felt this way about the paintings, and I was hurt by his description of them. I yelled, got mad, and told him that the paints aren\u2019t going anywhere and if he doesn\u2019t like it, then we can always go out to a restaurant instead. He pointed out that this is his house too now and he should be able to have his friends over for dinner without having to make excuses for the decorations on the walls. \r  \n\r  \nI stood firm in my stance, and we argued some more. He ended up leaving for the night and staying at his friend\u2019s house. He has since come back and keeps bringing up the paintings every chance he gets. I don\u2019t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable, but I think he\u2019s more uncomfortable with my hobby than his friends would be and it\u2019s upsetting to think that over a year into our relationship this is just now coming out. So, am I the asshole? Should I just take the paintings down for one night and end this argument? I\u2019m starting to wonder what other things bother him that he hasn\u2019t told me about.\r  \n", "created_utc": 1688926619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14v5j1l/aita_for_not_taking_down_my_paintings_so_my/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For that reason, YTA.", "ESH. He was wrong, to wait so long to express himself to you. And , definitely shouldn\u2019t have done it with such words. \n\nIf you invited him to live with you, and especially if he covers bills. It\u2019s his place of residence too. You both have say in shared spaces. Y\u2019all need to compromise. \n\nThat being said as an outsider seeking things like organs and disembodied heads, I\u2019d feel uncomfortable. You don\u2019t know what other people\u2019s triggers are.", "ESH. The way he approached this was  really insensitive and rude. He still has a point that it\u2019s his apartment too. It sounds to me like he\u2019s been trying to find a way to tell you he would like the apartment to be less dominated by your artwork in general and made an excuse of his friends coming over.\n\nLike\u2026I would not enjoy living in an apartment that had 15 paintings that were \u2018dark and macabre\u2019, and depending on the content I would definitely worry what friends would think when they came over. A good compromise would be to display a more limited number of them and/or display them in spaces that are less public or shared between you two.\n\nBut he should have come to you and said \u2018I love your art and how it helps you process your feelings. But, I find having so many of them around makes the apartment have a darker feel than I really enjoy. Could we find a compromise?\u2019 There\u2019s no excuse for the way he approached it. But you also can\u2019t just insist that you get unlimited wall space for your art at all times.", "YTA he was polite in asking you to take them down for one night. He told you they would make his friends uncomfortable. They\u2019re gory body parts. It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable ask because he lives there too. You said no and kept pushing so he told you they were sick and twisted. He didn\u2019t ask you to take them down completely, just for one night and you refused to compromise.", "Him saying the paintings are \u201ctwisted and sick\u201d was a bit mean, BUT he\u2019s right isn\u2019t he? Dark and macabre to you could also be \u201ctwisted and sick\u201d to others. The way you described your paintings in another comment just confirms that, as you said it\u2019s a lot of blood, organs, and severed heads. Him saying that\u2019s twisted is a valid opinion he has. Although I can seen how it might have hurt your feelings a bit in the moment. \n\nHow big is your apartment? If it\u2019s a small apartment then I could definitely see how 15 pieces of that type of painting could be too much for him and why he would think his friends would be uncomfortable. \n\nCould you not just compromise for one night? You say it\u2019s a great way to get to know who you are and a conversation starter, but i highly doubt your boyfriend wants your first real conversation/meet up with his friends to be about the painting. You said they are from a source of anger of negative emotions and you use painting as therapy basically and that\u2019s wonderful. But if you all are going to be discussing your paintings the. You\u2019re more than likely going to go into detail about your negative feelings for each piece. That\u2019s not really a light conversation that you want to be having for the first time with your boyfriends friends. I can see why he wouldn\u2019t want it brought up at your alls first get together with his close friends. The paintings do sound very dark and I could see it not being the best first impression of you. And I can see how that could be quite disturbing to other people. What if one of his friends have really bad reactions to something like that? Like what if the blood and organs triggers something in them? \n\nCouldn\u2019t you at the very least take most of your painting to your room just for one single night? Maybe pick out one or two to keep out and just make light conversation regarding those paintings. That way you aren\u2019t just bombarding them with all these \u201cdisturbing\u201d paintings the first time they come over? Again 15 is ALOT for a small apartment especially the type of paintings you\u2019re describing. \n\nOver time you can bring more and more paintings out and show them off. That way his friends are able to actually get to know you fully before you bring out the paintings? It sucks but people judge and get judged for all kinds of things. If this is still at the stage where you all need to get to know each other better, I can see why your boyfriend wouldn\u2019t want all of the paintings to be our right away. It might cloud the friend group\u2019s judgement of you. Where as if they get to know the real you first and then see the paintings, their judgement shouldn\u2019t be as harsh because they\u2019ve already come to learn the real you and they know that just because you make \u201cdark disturbing\u201d paintings doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re some kind of mental case. But if they see the paintings before getting to know you better, they may steer clear of you because they might think that you\u2019re a very \u201cdark\u201d person. \n\nJust my 2 cents. I\u2019m going with NAH. It was kind of mean how he said it, but he\u2019s not really lying about it? From what you described of your paintings they are disturbing. BUT he shouldn\u2019t expect you to always hide this part of yourself from them. Over time he 100% should be okay with you sharing more of yourself with his friends, but I understand why he would want to wait a bit for that, so his friends can know you better before seeing something that might turn them off of wanting to get to know you. It\u2019s just one night, and maybe see if you can leave 1 or 2 paintings out and put the others up in your room so it\u2019s not so overwhelming the first time his friends visit.", "You do Not start by introducing new people to your darkest most disturbing side. \n\nAnd with the info on what your paintings look like I\u2019d personally be \u201cOh dear that was my phone, let me just check\u2026 oh my uncle Arthur was in an accident! I Have to go Now! So sorry \u2026\u201d and run out of there lest I\u2019d be either served a person or end up next days supper myself. No thx. \n\nYTA.", "YTA....\n\n\n\"The paintings are of various things, but common themes in them are eyes staring at you, blood, organs, and disembodied heads.

I get having an outlet... but yea most people arent very complex and would think you are a mental case. Im super i to that stuff but the fact you have them hanging up around the house? Yea its a bit... dark", " AH, he asked for one night. You probably don't want to discuss your dark paintings and what let to them with his friends on their first visit...or well, not ideal.\n\n And honestly, it is great that you are using art as therapy....but this sort of thing is supposed to be painted and put away...or ideally discarded. Why would you intentionally surround yourself with all the negativity you once felt? Paintings carry vibrations=energy.....they are giving you that negative energy back.

He lets you put up your dark artwork 360 days a year, it's not a big ask to have some time with his friends. Truthfully I'm sure he finds your artwork depressing but lets you put it up because he cares about you.

You need your 15  paintings of gory body parts. He would like not to see them on a daily basis. It is probably about him not the guests, unless there are particularly unpleasant ones in the dining room.\n\nHe needs a more pleasant living space. He will probably move out and he should for his own mental health. And you can make a painting about the situation for your mental health. Just basic incompatibilty and different tastes in art.", "YTA.

He\u2019s allowed to think the paintings are cool, but also disturbing at the same time. He sounds completely reasonable and level headed and the fact that you are upset shows how detached from reality you are. He\u2019s also correct in that (if he pays rent) it\u2019s his home too.", "Surprisingly, YTA.\n\nYour boyfriend is accepting of you and your dark side, and is happy for them to be up most of the time. But what you\u2019ve described is quite graphic and could be upsetting.by no means do I think you should decorate to accommodate guests, but it sounds like your boyfriend doesn\u2019t love them either and just loves you.\n\nGetting to know his friends does not mean them getting to know the deepest, darkest parts of you.", "ESH\n\nYes, it is your home.

Your wall space needs to be an expression of both of you, not just you. It is past time to have a real discussion on how the space you guys share is decorating.

From what you've said your paintings are a form of therapy for you, you paint your darkest thoughts, which I'm glad that it works for you. But wanting everyone to see the artistic side and be intrigued instead of grossed/freaked out seems unreasonable. It would be like printing out pages from a therapy/Dream journal and having them posted on your walls. To me that is to personal for the first time meeting. Maybe you could compromise by having a few of the less gruesome ones out, and putting the more gruesome ones away, I know you said some have eyes staring at you (which could be a good talking point) but others have disemboweled bodies (which could make people queesy and put them off food) I think if you can't compromise, then you can't be together.

It\u2019s great you have an outlet. It doesn\u2019t mean that your partner is an AH for wanting to create an inviting atmosphere for people you\u2019re just getting acquainted with. \n\nESH. You for being so myopic about how your gory paintings may make others feel and he for using your paintings and their significance against you. I do wonder though if this is just the most recent example of you lacking self-awareness when it comes to how you process things in your relationship. When someone moves in you\u2019re inviting them to make your home their home. Sometimes that means moving your stuff around so that the living space meets both your needs.\n\nNot wanting to look at gores pictures all day every day at your home is 100% acceptable and does not mean he isn\u2019t supportive. Though the way you both handled this makes both of you look like you care more about what you want than your relationship.", "Okay. This should be included in your original post because it makes a HUGE difference! People don\u2019t want to be at dinner party staring at blood, organs, and disembodied heads. Maybe it\u2019s too late for this, but is there some sort of compromise where you can display your least stomach-churning pieces and put the rest away (again, dinner party).\n\nIf you\u2019re unwilling to compromise, then, yes, YTA and you obviously don\u2019t care about making your partner\u2019s friends feel comfortable in your house.", "Be honest, why didn't you mention this in your post?", "Honey, come on.  \n\nYou have to have a clue how that could be upsetting to someone. I get that's it your expression, and that is perfectly fine, but when you have people over it's common courtesy & common sense to ensure they won't be exposed to something this potentially upsetting. \n\nTo give an example , my sister and brothers loves horror movies. They can watch Saw or other torture movies & talk about the weather. It just doesn't bother them. However it does very much both me. Not only do I not enjoy it, but it triggers a lot of anxiety & bad dreams for me. So when we get together we don't watch horror movies because they respect that it upsets me. Your paintings would probably be the same for other friends. \n\nIf he wants them down forever that's enough entirely different issue, but just to take down for the night to make sure your friends aren't uncomfortable while at your house, it should be a no brainer.", "This and moving in with a guy after 6 months is quite worrying when it comes to your mental health.", "I write poetry, particularly when I\u2019m depressed, sad, lonely, etc. Needless to say, my writings are not uplifting. My father hated my writings because they weren\u2019t happy and carefree. I learned early that while I might be expressing myself, not everyone is ready to \u201chear\u201d what I have to say, or what I\u2019m feeling, especially if it is a negative emotion. If you\u2019re good at expressing your emotions, 15 of such emotional artwork likely is quite overwhelming to view.", "They sound cool, can we see one?\n\nNgl I think that\u2019s awesome. Not sure if I\u2019d want them in my apartment but really the kind of thing I like.", "Kinda off topic but can I see the paintings?", "I had just assumed the paintings had ominous vibes or something but didn\u2019t realize it was full on gore. I guess you\u2019re allowed to have what you want in your own house, but I know that I would be uncomfortable.", "Oh wow. Art is freedom of expression, and if you consider your paintings art, that's okay. \n\nHowever, this isn't *about* your expression or your art.\n\nThis is about tact, social graces, and entertainment. \n\nThis art does not reflect, nor will it cultivate feelings of happiness, joy, and comfort. They aren't any of those things.\n\n**They would, therefore, not be appropriate for the occasion.**\n\nAgain, this is not about you. It's about the environment your bf wants to present to new guests. Please put the art away for this occasion. It would be a nice gesture, and his reasoning is rather sound. Do not take this personally.", "It actually sounds interesting. Also quite a fun way to start a conversation , even if the conversation is \"I want to sit looking away from the disembodied head\".", "Lol why would anyone down vote her describing her work?\n\nAnyway.\n\nNTA: However maybe you can come to an agreement on how to decorate. Otherwise you should be able to have your work up in a space you pay for. Maybe you each get half or something.", "i mean it sounds cool, I'd like to see them but idk if id be comfortable w them while eating", "Right? This post is full of the pro-mooching demographic", "Maybe he thought that by asking him to move in she was going to consider his feelings and make space for his taste and needs in their now shared home. Crazy right?!/s", "It\u2019s a given that moving in together means you will be co-creating the living space and making decisions together. He was an ass for how he went about it but it\u2019s also not fair to just say \u2018well you didn\u2019t say it was a problem before you moved in so now you don\u2019t get to change anything\u2019.", "Take a quick read at some of the other comments on this post and see what the general consensus is. If 90% of the people here are agreeing then\u2026.?", "It literally is his house too. They now share it. I don\u2019t like the way he went about it but it\u2019s not crazy that he doesn\u2019t love living surrounded by images of blood, disembodied heads and dark staring eyes.", "We're built different. I'd be excited to see it and have no issues eating with them around.", "If I loved the person who painted them and was proud of her work I would. \n\nThese are not prints she picked up somewhere, this is her art. If he's embarrassed by it then I think they have wider issues.", "\"Painting\" and painting nightmares are 2 totally different things. They would probably be creeped out and avoid you in the future.", "Info: and what if one of them has a sensitive stomach or may have issues with eating and the paintings could make it so they physically cannot eat? It would also be rude to invite someone over for dinner knowing there is a huge chance you ruin your appetite. Nothing wrong with you painting them, but just because you aren\u2019t bothered with them doesn\u2019t mean you could be causing serious issues for someone else. And if you\u2019re inviting a guest over (which you both should be able to do in your own home in your relationship) it should be understood that you don\u2019t go out of their way to make them uncomfortable. (How about you chat with the friends and see how they feel about them before making a decision and subjecting them to that with no warning???)", "Stay mad?", "Let\u2019s not forget there are 15!!! Of them in various places around the apartment. I\u2019m not sure how large the apartment is or how large the paintings are but that makes OP seem weird AF. I would not want my friends coming over either and I would think the person that painted them was a mental case too. Sorry, but that\u2019s my truth.\n\nPainting them for therapy is fine but having them displayed over with guest that\u2019s just inappropriate.", "Or eat while looking at it", "So if they were crucifixes and religious iconography (makes many people very uncomfortable) would you still support her having to take them down to appease the her partners wish to shield his friends from a part of her identity?", "I mean... A lot of things can put people off though. The paintings wouldn't bother me. But whatever. The issue is really about someone moving in and asking for changes. Changes to things they knew were there before. For instance. Let's say the dude had a bunch of paintings of nudes. That could make a woman moving in uncomfortable. Should they all come down? Or just a few?\n\nThe issue goes a lot deeper here too, since they're actually Ops work. So asking to take them down, is also asking her to hide something which she previously had in her home. Regardless of the content, the act of asking for this is a very sticky situation.", "Oh crap, I didn't even do that math. Yeah, I'll just reserve judgment on the paintings, because I feel confident these two have plenty more moments of uncomfortable adjustment and discovery coming up.", ">I had no idea he felt this way about the paintings\n\nHow can she consider his feelings if he didn't tell her before he moved in that he hated them? \n\nTelling someone you hate the art they created is massively different to disliking some throw pillows.", "I agree totally but this isn't like he dislikes some curtains, it's a part of her personality.", "Then he should have said that before he moved in. This is not just some decor she picked out, it is her art, her personal expression.", "[deleted]", "I'm a painter as well but even I wouldn't have those kinds of paintings up. I do have some vent art like OP has but it even scares ME when I see eyes from my own painting just staring right back at me. I usually flip them the other way or cover it. \n\nAnyways, I would absolutely LOVE to see OPs paintings but I just don't think these paintings are suitable for a dinner. That's it. If they weren't as gory, her boyfriend probably wouldn't have a problem with them in the dining area. Maybe put the least gory paintings in there instead? Or just have the dinner elsewhere so that everybody's happy and OPs paintings stay in place.", "Then they can kick rocks. It\u2019s her house and her paintings. Not everyone is into Live Laugh Love signs and paintings of sunsets and kittens. If her boyfriend has a problem with that he can take them to a restaurant. I\u2019m into horror and dark art and her paintings sound awesome. I also wouldn\u2019t give a shit what my boyfriend\u2019s friends thought about it, and definitely wouldn\u2019t be dating a guy that has an issue with that.", "This is not the sort of thing someone would say if they\u2019d ever actually cohabitated with someone in a healthy and respectful relationship. Yes, if something makes your partner uncomfortable you would presumably want to compromise because you love and respect them and their needs. \n\nWhat a silly argument!", "I dunno. I think both people have a responsibility to be aware of how their mental health and coping tactics impacts their relationship. This isn\u2019t something she needs to be ashamed of and he was a REAL ah for what he said, but we\u2019re getting one side of the story here and this kind of reaction strikes me as the last straw for someone that has already tried the gentle approach. \n\nMy husband and I have art that\u2019s a bit gory/controversial and it lives in spaces where we can enjoy it without worrying about how it impacts our guests. I also think it\u2019s inappropriate to make others sit in what is essentially a room of deep-dark mental health issue processing when they\u2019re just trying to eat dinner.\n\nMaybe they should just go out to eat!", "I think it\u2019s entirely possible that someone who didn\u2019t think to offer to take some down when he moved in - even just so he could hang stuff he brought - may not be as observant of other\u2019s feelings when it comes to her art. He was not right to say what he did, but I don\u2019t believe this situation just sprang up out of nowhere. And her reaction to  him asking her to remove them - getting super defensive and turning it into an argument about them being a great conversation piece and completely dismissing his concerns - shows you just how open to someone\u2019s feelings she is. And that\u2019s open enough to want to talk all about it, but not open enough to understand that not everyone is comfortable seeing or talking about an acquaintance\u2019s trauma or mental health issues. People that enjoy that seek out those situations by going to shows and art galleries. I doubt they expect it at a casual get together.", "Now he is expressing his discomfort and being dismissed. So are we supposed to think op would've TRULY taken his feelings into account earlier?", "A part of her personality that is completely dominating their shared apartment. He can think the paintings are cool but think it\u2019s a bit much to have 15 of them up. And shouldn\u2019t the place reflect his personality too?", "That\u2019s the problem though. How can you constructively discuss an issue if one person has tied who they are to the issue so much that any disagreement over it becomes an insult to them personally. That\u2019s a really childish and selfish way to navigate mental health needs and puts her bf in a situation where topics are off limits no matter how it is or isn\u2019t meeting his needs.", "Uh, you have no idea whether they added him to the lease but it doesn\u2019t matter. When you move in with a partner your space becomes shared space. What if he has some art of his own he\u2019d like to put up?", "I think it's more the way he worded it that made me think he had an issue with the paintings rather than simply.not wanting them up for dinner.\n\n> I  think he\u2019s more uncomfortable with my hobby than his friends would be and it\u2019s upsetting to think that over a year into our relationship this is just now coming out", "His house too", "Agreed, in this instance going out is probably the best option because it gives them more time to discuss it calmly without the pressure of needing an immediate resolution.", "Her feelings were hurt by the way he described her paintings and because she previously had no idea he felt that way. If he'd brought it up a bit more delicately and in less of a time sensitive way she might have been more receptive. Hopefully calmer heads will prevail and they can talk it out properly when they've both calmed down.", "Yes but he isn't asking her to share space, he's asking her to hide her stuff. I feel like this could have been resolved a lot better if they'd talked about it before they had the pressure of guests coming over.", "His initial request was reasonable. Having those paintings up while you have guests over? You never know who has triggers to what and OP has 15 of various gory paintings. Some people get queasy just at the sight of blood. Even if they weren't having a dinner, it would still make some uncomfortable.\n\nBut I do think he went too far when they argued by saying hurtful things. They BOTH have the right to be comfortable in their home but need to have a serious conversation and to compromise if they want this to work.\n\nESH.", "Her house that he moved into and had no problem with her paintings until now.", "And maybe for both to apologize for their own part in the way they communicated this time around.\n\nPlus no dishes!", "Yup, that\u2019s why ESH.", "Apartment. And he apparently always had a problem just didn\u2019t say anything which is on him.", "The he shouldn\u2019t date a girl that\u2019s into it. It\u2019s quite simple - accept people for who they are and be proud of them or don\u2019t date them.", "Agreed"]}
