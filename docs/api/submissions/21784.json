I love to paint. It\u2019s just a fun hobby that I use as my own version of therapy. Anytime I feel overwhelmed or particularly frustrated, I pour those emotions into a new painting and feel much better after it\u2019s finished. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m the next Bob Ross or anything, but I like my paintings and my friends and family always compliment them. I have about 15 of them hanging up around my apartment in various places. My boyfriend, J, has always said how cool he thought the paintings were and has never tried to discourage me from putting them up all over the place. \r  \n\r  \nAbout a week ago, J said he would like to host dinner with his friends at the apartment. They\u2019ve never been over, and he thought it would be a good opportunity for his friends and I to get to know each other better. I agreed and was happy to cook, make drinks, and host. I immediately started planning what I was going to make and asking J if there were any dietary restrictions that his friends have. He stopped me in my tracks and told me he had one request to make before he confirmed with his friends. He asked me if I would take all my paintings down for the evening and put them in our bedroom. When I pressed him for why he would want me to do that, he shrugged his shoulders and said they might make his friends uncomfortable. \r  \n\r  \nNow my paintings are an expression of my negative emotions, so as you can imagine they lean toward the dark and macabre. They aren\u2019t by any means pretty landscapes or bright flowers, but they are still my art and very personal to me. If the goal of the dinner is to get to know each other more, I would think they are a great conversation piece and show a lot of insight into who I am and what I like to do. J argued with me saying they are \u201ctwisted and sick\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t want his friends to think I\u2019m some sort of mental case. I had no idea he felt this way about the paintings, and I was hurt by his description of them. I yelled, got mad, and told him that the paints aren\u2019t going anywhere and if he doesn\u2019t like it, then we can always go out to a restaurant instead. He pointed out that this is his house too now and he should be able to have his friends over for dinner without having to make excuses for the decorations on the walls. \r  \n\r  \nI stood firm in my stance, and we argued some more. He ended up leaving for the night and staying at his friend\u2019s house. He has since come back and keeps bringing up the paintings every chance he gets. I don\u2019t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable, but I think he\u2019s more uncomfortable with my hobby than his friends would be and it\u2019s upsetting to think that over a year into our relationship this is just now coming out. So, am I the asshole? Should I just take the paintings down for one night and end this argument? I\u2019m starting to wonder what other things bother him that he hasn\u2019t told me about.\r  \n", "created_utc": 1688926619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14v5j1l/aita_for_not_taking_down_my_paintings_so_my/", "score": 654, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For that reason, YTA.", "ESH. He was wrong, to wait so long to express himself to you. And , definitely shouldn\u2019t have done it with such words. \n\nIf you invited him to live with you, and especially if he covers bills. It\u2019s his place of residence too. You both have say in shared spaces. Y\u2019all need to compromise. \n\nThat being said as an outsider seeking things like organs and disembodied heads, I\u2019d feel uncomfortable. You don\u2019t know what other people\u2019s triggers are.", "ESH. The way he approached this was  really insensitive and rude. He still has a point that it\u2019s his apartment too. It sounds to me like he\u2019s been trying to find a way to tell you he would like the apartment to be less dominated by your artwork in general and made an excuse of his friends coming over.\n\nLike\u2026I would not enjoy living in an apartment that had 15 paintings that were \u2018dark and macabre\u2019, and depending on the content I would definitely worry what friends would think when they came over. A good compromise would be to display a more limited number of them and/or display them in spaces that are less public or shared between you two.\n\nBut he should have come to you and said \u2018I love your art and how it helps you process your feelings. But, I find having so many of them around makes the apartment have a darker feel than I really enjoy. Could we find a compromise?\u2019 There\u2019s no excuse for the way he approached it. But you also can\u2019t just insist that you get unlimited wall space for your art at all times.", "YTA he was polite in asking you to take them down for one night. He told you they would make his friends uncomfortable. They\u2019re gory body parts. It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable ask because he lives there too. You said no and kept pushing so he told you they were sick and twisted. He didn\u2019t ask you to take them down completely, just for one night and you refused to compromise.", "Him saying the paintings are \u201ctwisted and sick\u201d was a bit mean, BUT he\u2019s right isn\u2019t he? Dark and macabre to you could also be \u201ctwisted and sick\u201d to others. The way you described your paintings in another comment just confirms that, as you said it\u2019s a lot of blood, organs, and severed heads. Him saying that\u2019s twisted is a valid opinion he has. Although I can seen how it might have hurt your feelings a bit in the moment. \n\nHow big is your apartment? If it\u2019s a small apartment then I could definitely see how 15 pieces of that type of painting could be too much for him and why he would think his friends would be uncomfortable. \n\nCould you not just compromise for one night? You say it\u2019s a great way to get to know who you are and a conversation starter, but i highly doubt your boyfriend wants your first real conversation/meet up with his friends to be about the painting. You said they are from a source of anger of negative emotions and you use painting as therapy basically and that\u2019s wonderful. But if you all are going to be discussing your paintings the. You\u2019re more than likely going to go into detail about your negative feelings for each piece. That\u2019s not really a light conversation that you want to be having for the first time with your boyfriends friends. I can see why he wouldn\u2019t want it brought up at your alls first get together with his close friends. The paintings do sound very dark and I could see it not being the best first impression of you. And I can see how that could be quite disturbing to other people. What if one of his friends have really bad reactions to something like that? Like what if the blood and organs triggers something in them? \n\nCouldn\u2019t you at the very least take most of your painting to your room just for one single night? Maybe pick out one or two to keep out and just make light conversation regarding those paintings. That way you aren\u2019t just bombarding them with all these \u201cdisturbing\u201d paintings the first time they come over? Again 15 is ALOT for a small apartment especially the type of paintings you\u2019re describing. \n\nOver time you can bring more and more paintings out and show them off. That way his friends are able to actually get to know you fully before you bring out the paintings? It sucks but people judge and get judged for all kinds of things. If this is still at the stage where you all need to get to know each other better, I can see why your boyfriend wouldn\u2019t want all of the paintings to be our right away. It might cloud the friend group\u2019s judgement of you. Where as if they get to know the real you first and then see the paintings, their judgement shouldn\u2019t be as harsh because they\u2019ve already come to learn the real you and they know that just because you make \u201cdark disturbing\u201d paintings doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re some kind of mental case. But if they see the paintings before getting to know you better, they may steer clear of you because they might think that you\u2019re a very \u201cdark\u201d person. \n\nJust my 2 cents. I\u2019m going with NAH. It was kind of mean how he said it, but he\u2019s not really lying about it? From what you described of your paintings they are disturbing. BUT he shouldn\u2019t expect you to always hide this part of yourself from them. Over time he 100% should be okay with you sharing more of yourself with his friends, but I understand why he would want to wait a bit for that, so his friends can know you better before seeing something that might turn them off of wanting to get to know you. It\u2019s just one night, and maybe see if you can leave 1 or 2 paintings out and put the others up in your room so it\u2019s not so overwhelming the first time his friends visit.", "You do Not start by introducing new people to your darkest most disturbing side. \n\nAnd with the info on what your paintings look like I\u2019d personally be \u201cOh dear that was my phone, let me just check\u2026 oh my uncle Arthur was in an accident! I Have to go Now! So sorry \u2026\u201d and run out of there lest I\u2019d be either served a person or end up next days supper myself. No thx. \n\nYTA.", "YTA....\n\n\n\"The paintings are of various things, but common themes in them are eyes staring at you, blood, organs, and disembodied heads.

Yea its a bit... dark", " AH, he asked for one night. You probably don't want to discuss your dark paintings and what let to them with his friends on their first visit...or well, not ideal.\n\n And honestly, it is great that you are using art as therapy....but this sort of thing is supposed to be painted and put away...or ideally discarded. Why would you intentionally surround yourself with all the negativity you once felt? Paintings carry vibrations=energy.....they are giving you that negative energy back.

He lets you put up your dark artwork 360 days a year, it's not a big ask to have some time with his friends. Truthfully I'm sure he finds your artwork depressing but lets you put it up because he cares about you.

You need your 15  paintings of gory body parts. He would like not to see them on a daily basis. It is probably about him not the guests, unless there are particularly unpleasant ones in the dining room.\n\nHe needs a more pleasant living space. He will probably move out and he should for his own mental health. And you can make a painting about the situation for your mental health.

He\u2019s allowed to think the paintings are cool, but also disturbing at the same time. He sounds completely reasonable and level headed and the fact that you are upset shows how detached from reality you are. He\u2019s also correct in that (if he pays rent) it\u2019s his home too.", "Surprisingly, YTA.\n\nYour boyfriend is accepting of you and your dark side, and is happy for them to be up most of the time. But what you\u2019ve described is quite graphic and could be upsetting.by no means do I think you should decorate to accommodate guests, but it sounds like your boyfriend doesn\u2019t love them either and just loves you.\n\nGetting to know his friends does not mean them getting to know the deepest, darkest parts of you.", "ESH\n\nYes, it is your home.

Your wall space needs to be an expression of both of you, not just you. It is past time to have a real discussion on how the space you guys share is decorating.

From what you've said your paintings are a form of therapy for you, you paint your darkest thoughts, which I'm glad that it works for you. But wanting everyone to see the artistic side and be intrigued instead of grossed/freaked out seems unreasonable. It would be like printing out pages from a therapy/Dream journal and having them posted on your walls. To me that is to personal for the first time meeting. Maybe you could compromise by having a few of the less gruesome ones out, and putting the more gruesome ones away, I know you said some have eyes staring at you (which could be a good talking point) but others have disemboweled bodies (which could make people queesy and put them off food) I think if you can't compromise, then you can't be together.

You for being so myopic about how your gory paintings may make others feel and he for using your paintings and their significance against you. I do wonder though if this is just the most recent example of you lacking self-awareness when it comes to how you process things in your relationship.

They can watch Saw or other torture movies & talk about the weather. It just doesn't bother them. However it does very much both me. Not only do I not enjoy it, but it triggers a lot of anxiety & bad dreams for me. So when we get together we don't watch horror movies because they respect that it upsets me.

All of the large focal point art in my home actually belongs to other artist. \n\n4.  Bloody paintings are not appropriate for people not expecting them. Just like you worked through trauma to paint them, what if someone comes in your home not expecting to see that imagery, and it drudges up their own trauma from the past?", "YTA. Truth Time: Art therapy is not about creating some 'final product' for public display. It is instead a *process* intended to take place in a private context, to promote our own reflections on our internal workings, to better facilitate each next step toward personal transformation to a healthier state of being. (And notably: for the purpose of engaging with the external world in a more healthy way, opening up more opportunities for ourselves, not closing opportunities off.) \n\nBy immortalizing and plastering up images of blood and guts, decapitated figures and creepily staring eyes, as permanent decorations on your apartment walls where any visitor may see them, you're not doing 'therapy'. Therapy is structured to be transitional, toward an end goal of health; you wouldn't be constantly reproducing and keeping the same unchanging type of images around if you were actually making therapeutic progress. And letting random houseguests (not just a trained therapist or at least carefully selected and rare individuals who can be trusted with the deepest and most difficult things of your heart) view these vulnerable images... it seems to reflect an unhealthy difficulty to set appropriate boundaries that will protect you from unnecessary harm (including social harm) in this world. Because the truth is, many houseguests *will* think these images (especially revealed to them so carelessly and boundary-lessly, on living room walls) are evidence of untreated mental health issues. It wouldn't be just the fact that you paint gory things in the context of working through internal issues therapeutically (many people would be able to understand that). It would be that you would seem to lack the common sense or ability to 'read the room' and appreciate social norms, such that you can't navigate appropriate boundaries around who you should share your personal therapy work with, and who you shouldn't. Who you should expose to your gory paintings, and who you shouldn't. And people feel (quite reasonably) uncomfortable around people who don't seem capable of recognizing or respecting appropriate boundaries. Because people who can't recognize them, are unlikely to respect the ones that matter to others.\n\nSo, basically, YTA... in this situation. But I don't think you're a literal A. I think you'd benefit from actual therapy, and I'm sorry to hear that it sounds like you're not yet receiving this. In my opinion, everyone would benefit from therapy. But it needs to be a real and legit therapeutic technique, not just an occasional release of stress and heavy feelings producing temporary feeling of positivity, but no larger transition of behaviours and life-way to a more healthy pattern. If you were experiencing true therapy, I'd expect the images on your walls to move to a more private room... and I'd also expect them to eventually change in what kind of imagery they display. And in the meantime, I think it's healthy (even if it feels temporarily uncomfortable) that your boyfriend has raised to your attention that there's an actual issue here. I hope you're able to take some time to breathe and humbly reflect on it, and consider whether a different approach may actually be in your best interests after all.", "YTA.

You can definitely make a lot of people uncomfortable with that and no, it is not something you discuss with anybody you just met. These sort of things need time and slow introductions because remember, these things are normalized to you, not to everybody. I love the macabre and while personally I would ask genuine questions about the topic with you, I also know that not everyone is the same and that's not a bad thing. Sometimes you have to learn to compromise in life and  take things slowly to get a better outcome.\n\nSo yeah, I understand your boyfriend *but* I don't think the way he's approaching things is good either.

I didn't expect the polarizing response this has gotten. I feel I should clarify a couple of things. For the people who are saying we moved in together too early, I agree. It was never our plan, but due to some issues where my boyfriend was living before, we just decided it would be the better environment for him. I have a big apartment (two spare bedrooms, our room, and an office), so before my BF moved in, I was even considering downsizing. \n\nAs far as the content of the paintings... A few people have said I was being purposefully vague about them in my post. I tried to explain that they were dark and expression of negative emotions. I didn't know if anyone would want me to go into detail about them. It's hard to describe them because each piece is different. I've never hidden them or destroyed them as some people suggested I should do because I genuinely love them and they make me happy to see. Each one has its own story and feeling to it and destroying them would be destroying hundreds of hours of work that I put into them.\n\nThere are no disembodied heads in my dining room. Most of my paintings are upstairs and not in the common area already. Only 5 are actually in an area that most people would see. I was not upset that my BF thought his friends might be uncomfortable with the paintings. While I love horror movies, books, and art, I do understand that not everyone does. What I was more upset about what that for over a year, my BF has told me he likes them and has no problem with them being around the house. Yes, I have asked him multiple times. I've even asked him if he would like me to hang them in my office and he has told me there is no need to do that. \n\nI hope this clarifies some things for people.

He moved in to her space and doesn\u2019t even pay rent. When you date someone you accept them as they are or they aren\u2019t the right person for you. He can take his friends to a restaurant if it bothers him. OP is right. Lose the boyfriend and find one that is proud of her and her work.", "I have an actual severed head at my house, made from goat skin and leather. I also have a baby bunny preserved in a jar (one of many spooky gifts from my boyfriend), several pieces of dark art, framed horror posters and a collection of skulls. My grandmother has been to my house. So have my parents, my boyfriend\u2019s parents, neighbors and friends. Oh, and we live in the South.\n\nNot one of them has ever objected to our chosen decor. Not. One. Person. \n\nBecause it\u2019s our space and they respect that. Because they love us and know these things make us happy.  If they didn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t come over.", "he\u2019s asking her to move them for the evening, not take them down altogether forever? that seems like a more than reasonable request imo", "I got to say that's not on my checklist of things to think about before I move in somewhere.", "You seem desperate to try and play the \"controlling unsupportive bf\" card. He isn't. He wants a day without literal gore paintings on the walls of his shared space.", "Got it. So same thing if he decides he likes pictures of animals having sex? Dead kids? Human Anuses? Poop? \n\nI'm glad that works for you and your husband, but the point is it IS NOT working for op's boyfriend. You said you and your man compromise over decor, which is the exact opposite of what you first said to me. \n\nThis is a weird conversation. You say you don't agree with me, but you're agreeing with me. If your boyfriend decided he was grossed out by your baby bunny in a jar, you'd just keep it up because \"nobody talks to me that way\"? \n\nI honestly can't tell if you agree with me or not based on what you're writing. Maybe it's because you did that big ninja edit in our first conversation once you saw the downvotes flowing free.", "Tbh I\u2019d be grossed out seeing that but wouldnt say anything to the people who own the severed head because I\u2019d be scared of them.", "For real. There was a similar post not long ago but from the boyfriend\u2019s POV (not saying OP stole the idea or anything) where the response was the exact opposite of this one. The girlfriend had an expensive collection of oddities and the boyfriend wanted to hide them for a dinner party. He got torn apart in the comments and declared the a-hole. Seems there\u2019s a different group of Redditors here today. \n\nEverybody loves the weird girl until she does something weird. \n\nAs a weirdo myself, anyone who comes over knows they\u2019re going to see weird stuff. Dolls, ouija boards, horror movie merch, a bunch of Bowie memorabilia. You can deal with it or GTFO. \n\nThe boyfriend shouldn\u2019t have continued dating OP if he had an issue with it and he definitely shouldn\u2019t have moved in. *Oh, btw, I really hate everything you\u2019ve created and you need to hide it all or me and my judgmental friends won\u2019t like you anymore, lol.* \n\nYeah, no. NTA.", "And you don\u2019t think that will set a precedent for all future guest appearances? Do you think he will be ok with them all going back up and he won\u2019t ask her to remove them again the next time he\u2019s going to have company?", "Really? \n\nHave you moved into someone else\u2019s space that had decor that makes you uncomfortable and waited months to bring it up while actively encouraging that person to continue to create the exact pieces you have a problem with to then turn around and call them a sick and twisted mental case?", "Ikr imagine a world where it\u2019s wrong to put away paintings of severed heads for guests who are coming over for the first time.", "I\u2019m pretty sure none of the people in our lives are scared of either of us. If a stranger were to come over and was scared, that\u2019s their problem. I\u2019d also think they\u2019re probably boring and not someone I\u2019d be friends with anyway.", "I remember that post and that guy was definitely the asshole. I completely agree with you, and any guy who objected to my interest in horror and dark art would be an instant dealbreaker."]}
