I charge her $50 per week for rent which is way below the rental value of her room because I don't want to make money off my child. I just want her to learn financial responsibility. We do online bank transfers and don't have formal paperwork for the arrangement.\n\nHowever she recently told me that she wants a legal tenancy contract so that she has paper proof of paying rent. This is not necessary since I will just answer questions about her rental history as a reference on her apartment applications. She is saving up to move out and has a friend she plans to move in with eventually. She doesn't have much credit so will probably need me to be a guarantor anyway.\n\nShe got upset by this and said she doesn't want to rely on me to vouch for her when I could say whatever I want. I have never done anything to indicate I can't be trusted, so I was confused.\n\nShe said that I sprung the rental payments on her as soon as I could \"get away with it,\" but like I said, it's about financial responsibility. I don't think she understands it's my job to make sure she can survive on her own.\n\nShe got more upset and said that she wouldn't still be living at home if not for me, so the rent is unfair. I did have to borrow about $5,000 from her to pay past due bills and the mortgage because the household was hit hard by COVID-related debts. But I have always intended to pay her back when I can and she knows that.\n\nI offered to start deducting her rent from the $5,000 I owe her so she can keep all of her current income for her moving fund. But that just set her off again because now she thinks I'm making excuses to charge her money so I can close the debt and never have to pay her back.\n\nSo her ultimatum is that either I stop charging rent entirely, or I grant her full tenants rights with legal paperwork. She's living in my house well into adulthood and is my daughter, not a real tenant. I was taken aback by all of this so I'm at a loss.

Demanding rent and refusing to give her any paperwork for it is illegal pretty much everywhere. You aren't teaching her \"financial responsibility\", at best you're teaching her fraud and how to take advantage of family members to cover your arse for your own financial mismanagement.", "YTA.  You \"borrowed\" money from your daughter with apparently no real plan for paying it back, but want to teach her financial responsibility?  She's being responsible asking for a contract.  You don't even say she's asking to change the terms of what you've decided, just to put it in writing.  I'd say that's pretty darn responsible of her.  Also, that your 20 year old daughter even had $5000 available for you to borrow seems to indicate some financial sense.  \n\nThere's tons of evidence that today's world is a lot different than when previous generations hit their 20s.  Housing (including rent) has skyrocketed while wages have remained stagnant.  Even a college degree and decent job don't guarantee much independence these days.  Have a good look at the reality facing young folks now and ask yourself if it's really that crazy for her to want something in writing.  If you're charging rent, she IS a real tenant.", "YTA. **Pay her back the 5k you borrowed from her.** ASAP. If you're only charging her $50/wk rent for \"financial responsibility\" then it doesn't really look like you need to do this. She doesn't seem to be the one to have financial responsibility issues. It does look like you're charging her money to close the debt.\n\nAnd you should give her something written about the fact that she's been paying rent, for how long, etc. She needs that when she applies to places.\n\nAnd by the way, a 20yo is not \"well into adulthood\"! -particularly not in this economy/rental housing market.", "You\u2019re charging her rent because you want her to learn financial responsibility? She knows it\u2019s important to have a rental agreement as a tenant, so it sounds like she\u2019s very financially responsible! \n\nPerhaps when you write up the rental agreement, you can also formalize your repayment plan for the loan she made you, if you don\u2019t have one already. Remember to include interest payments as well \n\nAlso, YTA", "YTA, if your daughter is able to lend you $5k, she definitely sounds more financially responsible than the person who needed to borrow $5k from her. Your excuse to wanting her to learn financial responsibility is moot.", "YTA.  You charge her rent and steal $5000 from her.  Then you won't take minimal steps to help her get a place of her own.

But can you see where it seems disingenuous when you borrowed money from her then decided to start charging rent- a debt she didn\u2019t previously have- and then offer to deduct her rent from the $5k you owe? This right here would create a lack of trust with most people- especially as her goal is to move out. Not only does it look like you are trying to get out of paying her back- you are preventing her from moving out sooner.\n\nYTA. Pay her back. Clear that debt. Then charge her rent.", "wtf YTA for multiple reasons\n1) for charging rent to your 20 year old child and calling it teaching financial responsibility at least be honest, your keeping the money for your own benefit\n2) for not allowing her to be an on-paper ren ent\n3) most of all for owing her an exorbitant amount of money and still having the audacity to charge her rent and not pay her back. get your act together.", "YTA.\n\nyou borrowed money from your daughter.

YTA. Also you should pay her back.", "YTA.\n\nAfter you borrowed $5,000 from your daughter, you should have started paying her $50 per week (or more) until the loan was repaid.\n\nYour statement that you \"intend\" to pay her back is total bullshit.\n\nYou have no business trying to teach her lessons about financial responsibility when your actions are so irresponsible.", "YTA. She's being sensible.", "are you lying to us and her when you said you are charging her rent to teach her financial responsibility? Seems like the fact you had to borrow a large sum from her shows that you are not financially responsible. If you had instead framed it as you being in financial dire straights and needing help, that's a different matter. I mean, there's no problem with charging rent if you would alternatively have a tenant in the space she is occupying since she is an adult. But framing it as a financial lesson for her is a cop out especially because if you wouldn't borrow the money, she could have moved out, and you could have put a tenant in her place. YTA big time. I suggest she requests a contract and payment plan for the money you owe her, including interest to teach YOU about financial responsibility", "YTA for not paying back the money she loaded you.\n\nYou're not qualified to teach her financial responsibility.", "YTA I find it funny you respond to comments but avoid responding to the part where people are telling or asking you to pay her 5k back. Seems like you stole the money since you clearly have no intention of paying it back.", "YTA and a huge one.

And you owe her a huge amount of money which you \u201cintend\u201d to pay back, but you haven\u2019t, and you\u2019re still charging her rent.

You refuse to pay back money you borrowed from your daughter 2 years ago but she has to pay you rent? If I were her, I'd just demand the money back and move out. She's still saving up because YOU weren't responsible with your finances, you're the last one who should be teaching her anything lmao\n\nFirst lesson in financial responsibility: never lend money to someone who's not good for their word.", "YTA you say it's your job to prepare her yet you're not. Not charging her rent isn't you actively paying her back. Hopefully she make you sing something the next time you want to borrow. Either way she will leave and no thanks to you.", "YTA\n\nThe question is have you even started paying her back the $5,000 you owe her? From this we have absolutely 0 info about that so at this point you've paid her nothing yet still have the gull to charge your daughter $50 a week for rent after she bailed your ass out.\n\nYou should be very happy that right now your daughter considers you still family with the way your acting. If she really wanted, she could take you to court for the $5000 owed and the fact you were still charging her rent.", "YTA it doesn't matter how reasonable her rent is compared to the market value, you can't charge people rent when you owe them money.\n\nWhy don't you want to have a rental agreement? How does it harm you? Your only argument against it seems to be you getting offended that the woman you've owed $5000 to for 2 years doesn't trust you.

In that light, your \"repayment offset offer\" is just a way of getting away from your responsibility to her.\n\n>Even when I decided to charge her rent, $200 a month is nowhere near the majority of her income. \n\nThat's pretty darned irrelevant, and makes it sound like you're just jealous of her having disposable income. The fact is that she had savings stored to act as a rental deposit, and now she doesn't because she lent the money to you - and now you're holding your repayment hostage, to be repaid on a way that means you don't have to do anything, obligates her to live in your house for another two years and doesn't actually help her replenish her savings in any real way.\n\n>I'm not stealing from her or trapping her or whatever she seems to have convinced herself I'm doing.\n\nThen pay her back what you owe her and prove it. \n\nBecause right now, you're only taking from her, and in such a way that she cannot leave your house.
