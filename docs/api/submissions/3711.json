He refused to pay child support or even really be involved with our lives.  My grandma (his mom) and my mom would try to get him to build a relationship with me and my Marie but anytime he was forced to interact with us, he would be really angry and aggressive toward us. Mom finally cut contact with him when we were 14 after he posted a rant on Facebook calling me and my sister greedy selfish c\\*nts because his license was suspended due to not paying his child support. We have not spoken to him since this happened (we're 21 now).\n\nLast week, I got a message on Instagram from a woman I've never met before. She said her name is Jill and she's my dad's fiance and that she knows that me and my sister aren't that close with our dad but that they are planning to get married in July and they'd both love for us to attend their wedding. I told her I don't want anything to do with that man and I'm pretty sure my sister doesn't either but that I'd pass along the message to her anyway. I also asked that she not contact me again in the future. She answered back that I should be nicer to my dad because he's done so much for me and I should be more grateful to him because she was never close to her dad and she forever will regret how she treated him before he died. I said I'm sorry about your dad but you need to stop projecting your issues onto me and my sister since the reason we don't have a relationship with my dad is because of HIS behavior and treatment of us and if she thinks its okay for a grown man to call his 14yo daughters c\\*nts then she needs to have her head looked at. She told me to quit being difficult and realize that we are family and we should care for one another. I told her that I don't care for my father or her for that matter and that they are not my family and that if she has any problem with that then she should take it up with my dad because it's his fault.\n\nI didn't feel like continuing to argue with a complete stranger at that point so I blocked her and I thought that would be the end of it but she messaged my sister after I blocked her and apparently Marie told her to f off because my dad called mom (her number's still the same) to berate me and Marie for being rude and disrespectful and demanded we apologize for upsetting Jill and making her cry and promise her we'd come to the wedding. Mom told me that while I don't have to go to the wedding if I don't want to, we still should have been kinder to Jill because our gripe isn't with her, it's with our dad.
