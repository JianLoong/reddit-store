She wants me to be excited that she baked a cake. And to have some cake.", "The Rowdy Roddy Piper approach. \"Just when you think you have all the answers, I change the questions!\"", "My family is also full of neuro divergence of various varieties. Unfortunately, various family members are the type who truly enjoy the guess what game, even going through multiple 'rounds'. Like 'oh that's close', next guess, 'not quite but similar' and so on til it's guessed. But when someone says guess what to me, it's like my brain thinking mechanisms get instantly full of sand and grind to a stop. My brain fills with buzzing and if the person presses me to truly guess, I'll likely have a meltdown or panic attack pretty quickly. I just find the infinite possible answers incredibly overwhelming, and I cannot deal with the 'on the spot' pressure to logically figure out what the answer could be, in the way that OP does. And I'm someone who loves logic puzzles etc, it's not that I can't do them, or wouldn't be able to guess, it's the 'on the spot' part that makes my brain break down. \n\nSo, how on earth does my family figure this out, with some who love the guessing game, some who don't? Well it's pretty easy actually. Everyone just knows who likes it or not and only does it with the family members who do... \n\nSometimes, they like to use the 'guess what' to kind of pre hype the conversation. Like if they got a promotion, it's boring to just state that outright vs going <'guess what?' - hmm I don't know, what? - 'well today I got a promotion! >. So to me, my family will either do what I just wrote, where they know my reply will be \"I don't know, what is it?\" or similar, and then they will answer what it is straight after. Or they'll say \"guess what? Today I (insert thing)\" all as one without waiting for me to guess or anything. There's so many ways round the issue, but only if you care about the other person and listen to them when they explain how they communicate and why, and what they expect in return", "I'm autistic, so I get way too obsessed with making sure the person I'm speaking to knows that I'm listening to and understanding them. So, I end up repeating things like 'I know what you mean' and similar, way too often, or else my brain panics that the person won't know that I'm still listening...\n\nI spent many years in speech/occupational therapy, particularly when I was non verbal for years as a kid. Even when I was 'verbal', my speech was only from scripting for years after that(essentially, conversing from a flow chart. Therapy would teach me 'if you hear X, then you say Y' and repeat. Not really me timing upy own responses or thoughts, but more searching the database for what I was taught comes next after each prompt, then progressing to searching for the response closest to what I wanted to say. And eventually that lead to being able to have 'true' conversations, thinking up and saying my own thoughts and unique responses, not just one from a set list). \n\nSo, because I learnt how to speak/converse via scripting, I end up falling back on those same set phrases/responses I was first taught to say, and it's so deeply in built to my brain that I don't notice it now. Especially if my brain is especially overloaded or anything that day. \n\n\nThere's some conversation habits I have, that I know are weird or annoying, but I truly cannot stop doing, because of how I learnt to converse. Those 'hear X so say Y' responses had to be hard wired into my brain for younger me to function, but that hard wiring now can't be undone. There are still times where I need that too, when I'm burnt out and having my 'conversation bot' ready to take over during those times can be the difference between being able to at least communicate something even if it's from a set list of responses vs totally shutting down and unable to get any response out", "It\u2019s all about the attitude. She sounds like a great mom", "You make some good points and while I agree with most, I don't agree about the way she communicated. \n\nShe didn't tell him she wanted him to communicate differently. What she actually did was *show him articles* that supposedly prove that her way of communicating is \"right\" and his is \"wrong\". That's actually passive aggressive BS. If my partner did that, I would ignore him and continue doing what I wanted. Why? Because showing me articles isn't asking a question. It's not making a request for him to change his behavior. He did not say she asked him to change. He only states that she showed him articles. What purpose does that serve? To make him feel different? Bad? Not normal? Why aren't there more people in this comment section pointing this out? It is heavily implied that she wants him to change when she shows him those articles but that's not the same as actually asking. Additionally, it's actually very rude to show him articles implying he's \"wrong\" because of his response. It's just as easy to also find articles stating that asking rhetorical questions is \"wrong\". \n\nSo as OP is a literal person, since she didn't actually ask him to change at all, why would he? All she did was attempt to \"other\" him by showing him articles. \n\nInstead, they should just talk to each other using clear language without relying so much on implications.
