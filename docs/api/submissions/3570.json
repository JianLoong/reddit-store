I've found a flight that is cheap, nonstop, and out of by far the most convenient airport around us.  \n\nMy partner is asking that we fly the exact week before a large project at work is due. To do so, tickets would be twice as expensive, require a layover, and be out of an airport twice as far away as the ticket I found above. I asked him to see if his job would delay the project for two days to fit the best week I identified. He refuses to ask his boss about it and insists his job is incredibly important and he cannot jeopardize this project.\n\nI told him that that was perfectly fine, and he could just come for the start of the trip and return on his own to get to the project, or he could just not come at all if the project was so important (I'm going to see family in large part and would be going regardless of if he came). He refuses and instead keeps asking that we take the exact flight he proposed. \n\nHe says I have no reason to not change the flight. When I respond that those dates would probably force me to abandon a plan to see friends in a distant city for New Year's, he says I should just take the risk or go and return on New Year's day itself after a 6 hour drive to then take an 8 AM international flight the day after. \n\nAt this point I've told him I won't make 4 or 5 aspects of the trip materially worse for me without him trying to see what his options at work are (or he could leave earlier, or just not go at all).

Absolutely NTA!", "NTA.\n\nYour partner might have very valid reasons for not wanting to ask about delaying the project at work. It's a sensitive issue. \n\nBut you acknowledge that and are fine with it. You aren't pressuring him into doing something he's uncomfortable with at work or into traveling on the dates you've picked if that timing isn't convenient for him. You're good.\n\nIt seems like the two of you are looking at this trip very differently. You're looking it as a trip to see your family with the added benefit of traveling with your partner to the extent that it works out.

Just go without him. Problem solved.", "NTA because you\u2019re not insisting on him taking the flights he wants to take, just refusing to inconvenience yourself massively for his work.

Why would you change flights that is far more inconvenient and expensive than what you have already booked? That\u2019s just unrealistic. Aside from the fact that he\u2019s unwilling to make waves at his job (which is understandable) the fact that he could still make part of the trip, or choose to stay home are both reasonable and understandable alternatives.  I don\u2019t think he\u2019s wrong to not want to put his job in jeopardy. Employers can be very difficult and unforgiving when employees try to do less than what is expected. Asking them to change dates at this late in their project is extremely unprofessional. They likely have deadlines and other partners or companies they\u2019re working with and have already made future plans. He\u2019d come off looking extremely unprofessional if he asked for any kind of delay\u2026especially for a vacation.  So he\u2019s NTA either.

Assuming his project was already on the books, a quick chat of \"hey are these dates ok\". \"no,  sorry I have a big project,  can't leave until its done\". \"how bout the following week\". \"that works!\" .\n\n  \nAlternatively, you partner is being pretty ridiculous regarding the concept of you going at separate times.  I've done that before.  Stuff happens and sometimes it just makes more sense for one person to go in advance, and then the other follow.  I've done that more than once.    That he doesn't realize that perhaps doubling your travel cost to travel together this one time isn't the most rational of options.\n\n  \nOn the flip side, your suggestion \"hey go to your company and tell them to delay a project so we can go on vacation\" is about as eye-rollingly silly a suggestion as I've ever heard.  Of course he's not going to ask his boss this.  Its utterly absurd.  \n\nBoth of you are spewing out ridiculousness at this point.", "ESH.

But yes, his job needs to be important to you as well. It\u2019s not some random even you have nothing to do with. He\u2019s your PARTNER. That means the money he brings in helps support YOUR life.
