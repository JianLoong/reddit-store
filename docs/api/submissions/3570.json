I've found a flight that is cheap, nonstop, and out of by far the most convenient airport around us.  \n\nMy partner is asking that we fly the exact week before a large project at work is due. To do so, tickets would be twice as expensive, require a layover, and be out of an airport twice as far away as the ticket I found above. I asked him to see if his job would delay the project for two days to fit the best week I identified. He refuses to ask his boss about it and insists his job is incredibly important and he cannot jeopardize this project.\n\nI told him that that was perfectly fine, and he could just come for the start of the trip and return on his own to get to the project, or he could just not come at all if the project was so important (I'm going to see family in large part and would be going regardless of if he came). He refuses and instead keeps asking that we take the exact flight he proposed. \n\nHe says I have no reason to not change the flight. When I respond that those dates would probably force me to abandon a plan to see friends in a distant city for New Year's, he says I should just take the risk or go and return on New Year's day itself after a 6 hour drive to then take an 8 AM international flight the day after. \n\nAt this point I've told him I won't make 4 or 5 aspects of the trip materially worse for me without him trying to see what his options at work are (or he could leave earlier, or just not go at all).

Plus the changes he wants would make the trip more expensive and longer and more complicated? When he could just make his own flight arrangements or just skip it? Absolutely NTA!", "NTA.\n\nYour partner might have very valid reasons for not wanting to ask about delaying the project at work. It's a sensitive issue. \n\nBut you acknowledge that and are fine with it. You aren't pressuring him into doing something he's uncomfortable with at work or into traveling on the dates you've picked if that timing isn't convenient for him. You're good.\n\nIt seems like the two of you are looking at this trip very differently. You're looking it as a trip to see your family with the added benefit of traveling with your partner to the extent that it works out. But he's looking at it as a trip with you, in which case your indifference to matching up travel schedules seems to be upsetting him.", "I think NTA. it's your trip to see your family. if he needs to leave early because of work, then that's his concern.", "NTA and explain that the best compromise is that he can take the flight that works for him and you'll take the one that works for you.", "NTA. Just go without him. Problem solved.", "NTA because you\u2019re not insisting on him taking the flights he wants to take, just refusing to inconvenience yourself massively for his work. What\u2019s keeping him from joining later or leaving earlier other than him feeling he\u2019s more important than you so you need to bend to his will?", "NTA. Why would you change flights that is far more inconvenient and expensive than what you have already booked? That\u2019s just unrealistic. Aside from the fact that he\u2019s unwilling to make waves at his job (which is understandable) the fact that he could still make part of the trip, or choose to stay home are both reasonable and understandable alternatives.  I don\u2019t think he\u2019s wrong to not want to put his job in jeopardy. Employers can be very difficult and unforgiving when employees try to do less than what is expected. Asking them to change dates at this late in their project is extremely unprofessional. They likely have deadlines and other partners or companies they\u2019re working with and have already made future plans. He\u2019d come off looking extremely unprofessional if he asked for any kind of delay\u2026especially for a vacation.  So he\u2019s NTA either. But, this is one of those circumstances that there\u2019s no winning answer.", "NTA", "NTA he is being unreasonable and petty", "INFO: why does he want to fly the exact week before the big project is due? Surely if it\u2019s that important, he wouldn\u2019t want to leave them short-staffed before a deadline?", "NTA\n\nYOU are taking the trip to see YOUR family. Why YOU should pay extra and end up more tired? Or why in his head it was normal to say '*return on New Year's day itself after a 6 hour drive to then take an 8 AM international flight the day after.'*  ?", "Nope NTA", "Will he pay the difference if you change flights from him?", "He hadn\u2019t even planned a trip.  She planned it. She was always planning to visit her family, and she found the best prices, while he is all for excessive spending.", "INFO: how long have your been with this man? How long since you\u2019ve seen these family members? \n\nHe may not be able to change the work deadline, but asking you to change all these flights and arrangements seems intended to isolate you.", "I am gonna say either NAH or ESH.  Either no one or everyone.    \nYou folks need to coordinate/communicate better.  Assuming his project was already on the books, a quick chat of \"hey are these dates ok\". \"no,  sorry I have a big project,  can't leave until its done\". \"how bout the following week\". \"that works!\" .\n\n  \nAlternatively, you partner is being pretty ridiculous regarding the concept of you going at separate times.  I've done that before.  Stuff happens and sometimes it just makes more sense for one person to go in advance, and then the other follow.  I've done that more than once.    That he doesn't realize that perhaps doubling your travel cost to travel together this one time isn't the most rational of options.\n\n  \nOn the flip side, your suggestion \"hey go to your company and tell them to delay a project so we can go on vacation\" is about as eye-rollingly silly a suggestion as I've ever heard.  Of course he's not going to ask his boss this.  Its utterly absurd.  \n\nBoth of you are spewing out ridiculousness at this point.", "ESH.  There is definitely a compromise here", "I\u2019m floating between YTA and ESH. Surely, those are not the only two ticket options in existence. There must be some way both of you can negotiate, instead of making this a power play. \n\nYou could go on a day neither of you has suggested and pay a little more. But yes, his job needs to be important to you as well. It\u2019s not some random even you have nothing to do with. He\u2019s your PARTNER. That means the money he brings in helps support YOUR life. Even if he only spends it on himself, those are expenses you don\u2019t have to worry about. \n\nAnd frankly, it seems a bit dismissive to be like, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you come or not.\u201d Which is how it sounds when you say, \u2018you don\u2019t have to come.\u2019 \n\nYou don\u2019t know what is going on with his work enough to understand what, if anything he\u2019s risking by asking to make changes. Also, it\u2019s good to have someone who understands how to prioritize supporting the family (you and him) over taking vacations.", "[deleted]", "Not voting either way, it just depends on your personalities. I have a friend and she and her bf would travel separate no problem. It wouldn\u2019t even phase them, they are beyond independent from each other. They also repeatedly take vacations separately, at random times will live in separate states. They\u2019ve been together 10 years and this situation just works for them. I have a few friends like that actually.\n\nBut then there\u2019s me and friends like me. I\u2019d rather try to find a way to make arrangements to see my family and be with my partner. I want memories with him, the 14 hour flights and talking.\n\nI would ask if this is his first international flight? He could be nervous. Or is he terrified of flying but willing to do it to be with you? If so then you\u2019d be the AH. Does he often make you rearrange your life for him but doesn\u2019t do the same for you? Then maybe he\u2019d be the AH.
