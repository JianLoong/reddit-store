No one wants to buy a house with trashy neighbors. I have a feeling you are deliberately writing yourself in a better light here.", "NTA but how old are your children? If there are playtoys and things all over the Yard as well as garbage there is an issue. You are allowed to keep your space how you want, but I also understand your neighbors wanting to present a clean organized presentation for any prospective buyers. (Also I'm Leary of you saying it's not that bad, which to me indicates it's bad) Can your kids help maintain the yard or are they too young?", ">my home has no bearing on hers.  \n\nYes, it does.   If your home has garbage along the side of the house or if it looks at all untidy, or unkempt it can lower the offers on the homes for sale in the area.  \n\nGranted, the area is not great, but a next door neighbor who doesn't keep things nice is going to make an impact on the purchase price.   \n\nBut I'm going with NTA because you seem to have done a lot of cleaning and they are nervous.   Calling the landlord was too much.   \nWhatever is in your yard is legal as long as it doesn't attract vermin, or is an attractive nuisance.", "YTA. You have 6 other people in your family! Make them clean up. Your back issues are a red herring.", "INFO - why is your yard full of trash in the first place? That's nasty.", "I think you've already gone over and above being neighborly. No, you're NTA for calling her out. I'm glad your landlord was understanding.  If this arrangement continues, take plenty of pics so you can show that you've picked it up and it's clean. It's also okay for you to tell them you've done enough and they'll need to find someone else. As a mom of 5, don't you have enough to do without being caretaker for your neighbor? You shouldn't injure your back for doing something that only seems to give you grief.", "NTA. Obviously you'll get rid of the 2 bags of trash when your bin is empty again at the next pickup.  \n\nIf your yard was \"so bad\" I'm guessing your landlord would have already said something before her call, or your other neighbors would have said something.\n\nIf she's having trouble selling the house, it probably has a lot more to do with it being in a \"shady area\" as you described, than over 2 bags of trash. Calling your landlord for that was an a-hole move.", "YTA.  You can't leave trash out.  Either produce less trash, start a compost pile for your food scraps, or hire a second private trash service.", "INFO: can you request a second garbage bin?", "YTA. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to contact a landlord with a complaint against a tenant. And your home\u2019s appearance does affect the value of her home. Could you call a junk hauling service to get all of your old garbage? Or use the neighbor\u2019s cans since she\u2019s not using them.", "YTA. Take your trash to the dump if you fall behind. Of course the neighbourhood has a bearing on the home being sold.", "YTA - you don\u2019t leave trash out. It\u2019s gross and that\u2019s how you attract all kinds of critters and such. Falling behind on your trash pickup isn\u2019t really something one should let happen.", "Eh, soft YTA. I understand the frustration of slow trash pickup, but your landlord can also get fined for trash piling up. Not to mention the risk of extra bugs and rodents who love to come hang out and snack.\n\nNeighbor was a bit rude, but also your mess to clean up.", "YTA - you don\u2019t see an issue with your backyard overflowing with garbage?\n\nThey tried dealing with you directly, when that got them no where they had a talk with your landlord in an attempt to resolve the issue. This isn\u2019t a miscommunication, this is them attempting to get a problem solved.", "YTA. You say it is only 2 bags and that your bin is full but you also say that trash is biweekly and you have another week to go. So with 5 kids and a spouse it would be unreasonable to think that you won't get several more bags before that time once again leaving you behind on trash and having bags outside the garage. Could you ask them to use their bins just this once to get rid of the excess so you are caught up? Hopefully next time you go out of town someone puts your trash out and you don't get behind. I see why they are worried tbh.", "INFO-how much garbage and how much space does it take up in the yard? Is it easy to see from the windows of the neighbors home? \n\nThis is an actual factor for some home buyers and I\u2019m sure this also comes as feedback from the realtor.", "YTA for having trash in your yard. You have a household of 8 people. You have no excuse to keep trash with that many people capable to get rid of it. Trash attracts rats and other animals that cause health and safety issues.", "YTA. The state of your house and yard does affect her; its unkempt appearance can potentially quash an offer from a prospective buyer. We have 3 such individuals in our neighborhood and the adjoining houses have always taken longer to sell, even in a seller's market. All I've seen from your replies are excuses as to why you can't do \"x, y or z\". Now is as good as time as any to teach your older children the value of hard work and personal responsibility.", "Not according to the neighbours.", "What are you suggesting I ship kids out? Lol. I did get it done. I dealt with the bags I'm waiting for garbage day.", "People have every right to have toys all over their yard. It's their yard! A neighbor doesn't have to like it, that's just too damn bad. If it's trash/furniture/debris that's a different story.", "My kids range from 2-10 and to be honest they don't do much. I asked them to help which they didn't. I did it all.", "It's 2 bags that's it. We fell behind because I went out of town and we missed garbage day because no one could come take it out.", "We have a food scraps bin. As I said they aren't very big and we are a large family. Before these bins showed up a year ago we put them outside and it was never an issue before.", "No. You can request a bigger bin which I have it. I can get an extra 2-3 bags in.", "A lot of people fall behind. Because its only every other week the bins aren't big. So it's easy. It's not something I mean to do it happened because I was away and no one brought the bin out back. It was also only two bags.", "Its not over flowing at all to me over flowing is more then 2. This was not an issue while we have been catching up. Only now.", "Their bins are full. We have used them in the past as the house has been empty since July. The garbage isn't the issue. I get it. Everyone is focusing on the garbage which I've been dealing with. I only care that she contacted my landlord after I had dealt with it. So I thought.", "It's literally two bags and you can't see it from their window or yard.", "I understand what they want and why $$. \nI appreciate having back issues, and can only imagine how much work it is keeping up with that many young children.  It sounds like you did try. I dont think you were even rude to ask your neighbor to speak to you about it. That way you can give their request some consideration. Hope they sell and you get some kind neighbors", "dude take it to the dump like a normal person", "I guess we have different ideas on property value and keeping things clean and organized, it seems you vouch for a more chaotic lived in look, while I and almost everyone without kids things having a cared for yard more appealing", "You tell kids to help. You dont ask. Why would they knowing you dont want to", "you asked? lol", "Lol totally understandable....", "The rest of it is leaves from the trees on her property.", "I\u2019d just buy another bin or two from Walmart or something to keep the trash in before transferring over to main bin \n\nNAH", "Put it in a garage, a shed, take it to the dump. Something. \n\nLeaving trash bags out is gross.", "If it\u2019s only two bags and some leaves then why are you complaining-throw it out and let her know. Clearly there has to be more than that because no one complains about two bags. What else is in you back yard? Is it emitting any smells or atttacting vermin?", "Our neighbor asked politely if we could move a couple of things out of sight so he\u2019d maybe get a couple thousand more. We were happy to help, but he was very clear that we didn\u2019t have to and that he felt rude asking. It\u2019s not hard to do this in a polite, neighborly way.", "It's city issued bins. So we can't use anything else but the bins they give out and we are only allowed 1. The house on the other side of me has the exact same issue. As there are tenants upstairs and downstairs. They have garbage pile up at times but no one complains when it comes to them.", "I agree it's gross but we don't have those options.", "Our bin is full and garbage day isn't for another week. There are no mice or smells. The people who lived here before us had mice issues but we haven't", "God, I would hope not. Our leaves are dropping daily, and no, they don't drop all the same time (which would be nice). We have several bags of leaves ready to go to the yard waste, but they're neatly lined up under the deck and out of sight until we have the time to make the last run of the year. Something else is afoot here.", "dude you\u2019re allowed to have secondary bins. you just can\u2019t put them out for pickup. you are kinda dense sorry", "> There was a few bags of garbage because we got behind and garbage pick up is only every other week and we only have so much space in the bins the city gives us.\n\nYou have a yard.  So you can drop a prefab shed there.\n\nYour city gives you X bins.  In some cities you can buy more bins.  If not, you hike along your street to the non-dealer houses and ask neighbors to use space in theirs for one pickup.\n\nYou ask selling-neighbor if you can put trash in the empty house\u2019s bins on pickup day.\n\nYou have a partner and five children and don\u2019t mention impossible transit issues - so odds are Someone has a car.  Or someone you know/you work with/husband works with has a car.  So you load the trash bags loose in your yard Into a car and take them to a dump yourself.\n\nYou have five children under 10.  There should never be trash or debris or junk in your yard where your kids run around.", "I\u2019m hearing a lot of excuses and not a lot of solutions. You should have had someone take out the trash when you were gone. You didn\u2019t. Just try and do better next time.", "But you literally said that you\u2019re already putting them on the other side of your garage? Just put them inside the garage instead of on the other side of the garage. If the bags are genuinely piling up so much that you can\u2019t fit them in with your vehicles in the garage, then that speaks to the fact that your garbage issue is a lot bigger than you\u2019re making it out to be.", "lmfaooooo", "I think you may need a unbiased opinion from someone who can see the yard. I can not imagine a neighbor who you had good relations before suddenly harassing you about garbage especially if they are not there. This info must be coming from prospective users and or the realtor\u2026", "There is no space for a shed. Our yard is tiny. \n\nNever actually thought about asking other neighbors. \n\nNo one has a car in my home. I could ask someone but when I have I get the ya sure and no one shows up I gave up asking for favors. \n\nIt's leaves. The debris is leaves.", "I absolutely did. I dealt with it all. But it wasn't enough. Currently there is no trash that can be seen. Just leaves. I dealt with it all. All that can be seen is leaves and toys.", "It's not piling up as bad as she made it sound. It's two bags which again are out of sight. My garage is basically a storage space. We don't have a car so we have things in there. I prefer not to put trash in with my decorations. Which is why it's outside on the side where it's completely out of sight.", "I have shown pictures to a few of my friends and they all said I don't see what the issue is. The house has only been on the market two days. The issue yesterday was over recycling bags not even the 2 garbage bags. Which is now out in my alley because tomorrow they get picked up.", "If people with a car aren\u2019t showing up for you, your husband needs to ask his cohorts to show up for him.\n\nHow did you throw your back out moving something heavy in your yard if it\u2019s just leaves?\n\nYou can get Five kids to and from daycare, school, doctors appointments, the grocery store etc with no car?  If you\u2019re in the US you must live in the 0.5% of cities with good comprehensive transit or actual functional walkable neighborhoods.  That wouldn\u2019t be possible in my city with two kids much less five.\n\nIf it\u2019s leaves, why are they bagged?  Run a mower over them a few times when they\u2019re dry and the mulch will settle right into the grass to decompose.  Do you have a mower and cut grass?  Or is your yard just trees and shaded mostly-dirt?  You can still mulch them with mostly-dirt but it\u2019s more noticable.\n\nHave you googled your city+leaf disposal?  They may have compost sites you can dump them at.  In my area you can post \u201cfree bagged leaves\u201d places like Nextdoor online and the local home kitchen gardeners often snag them to add to compost, but it sounds like you don\u2019t have gardeners in your area.", "Why didn't you rake and put the toys away?", "So then you\u2019re just lying about how you \u201cdon\u2019t have those options.\u201d You HAVE those options, you just don\u2019t LIKE those options.", "At this point it sounds like the realtor is giving them this info and could be exaggerating. Send a text with pics and let the neighbors know it\u2019s been clean but also let her know your confused and send photos And let them know you are unsure what was being referenced and ask her to please clarify what needs to be removed. It could be its other things that may not be garbage to you\u2026", "I'm a stay at home mom. The school is across the street from my house. I moved a bbq. I have no trees on my property it's on theirs. There is 3 giant trees but they blow on my lawn and yard. We have to put the leaves in the green bin (compost). Not the states. Yes I have a mower but it's currently out of gas because gas is ridiculous right now.", "It's not grass. I have no grass in my yard. I have to sweep it all. The toys are a ball and car which if toys are considered unsightly then that's a bit ridiculous.", "Don't like putting trash with my items? Stuff that I have in my home at times? I mean would you? Again it's already dealt with and out of sight from their property.", "I asked her to be clearer on what she needed from me.", "You can't rake leaves because there is no grass? I don't understand how the two are connected. And by 'no grass' do you mean bare dirt? Weeds? Something else?", "I do keep my extra garbage bags in my storage room, because I understand leaving them outside is how you attract rodents. And rodents don\u2019t give a fuck which property the garbage is or isn\u2019t visible from. If your garage is so packed full that you can\u2019t keep what you claim is just 2 extra garbage bags in there without it touching the rest of your stuff, then you have way too much stuff in there. If the garbage is so nasty that you can\u2019t even imagine it going in the storage room until pick up days, then you should really understand that *that\u2019s how you start a rodent problem.*", "People are weird - I remember when my parents use to rent and we were told we allowed garbage to pile up too much near our entrance. Later we found out the landlord was referencing Toys and planters\u2026.", "My \"yard\" is concrete hence the sweeping.", "It's just normal trash. There isn't even food in there. Diapers sure because I have a kid in diapers. The garbage isn't even the issue. I don't even care that she is telling me to deal with the garbage. I mean before bins guess where everyone put their trash. In their yards."]}
