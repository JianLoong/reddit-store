We've been going out for lunch, talking outside of work, etc. No hookups or anything like that lol...\n\nA former intern that I used to work with has come back to our company to become full time. One day my female coworker and I were eating lunch in the break room and my former intern sat at the table next to us and started smirking/laughing, he even took a picture of us eating together. My female coworker asked me what that was about and I told her that I'm assuming he thinks we're having sex.\n\nA couple days later I notice my female coworker has been ice cold towards me and I was wondering what was going on. One day she messaged me on our work chat and told me about how the lunch incident made her very uncomfortable, how she thinks that I told my former coworker that we were having sex (which I didnt), she also said she doesn't need rumors to be spreading around about something like that, and then told me that she needed space. I became very distraught after reading that. We haven't talked for about 2 weeks. I also noticed that she has blocked me off of all socials which to this day has still been bothering me...\n\nFast forward, a couple days ago at the end of the work day, we both usually leave around the same time and her desk is not too far from mine. We were both walking towards each other down the same hallway. I asked her how she was doing and replied with a little hesitation \"I guess im okay\" when she said that I can tell from her face that she was still alittle bothered by my presence. We walked into the break room and chatted for a little bit about what happened a couple weeks ago from the incident and coincidentally my former coworker walked past and started smirking/laughing again at us... I ignored it and didn't do anything because I know if I were to talk to him, he will only escalate the situation and won't stop. \n\nWhile we were talking in the break room, she was telling me that she only wants us to be just coworkers and that's it (we never set boundaries in the beginning), she told me that she didn't want rumors going around about us, she told me it bothered her that I didn't go to talk to my former coworker about the situation and that she still is assuming that I had said something to him to make him act that way towards us (which I didnt...), I defended myself and told her that I didn't say anything to him that would make him act this way, and of course she doesn't believe me. I told her that we are just friends and that I shouldn't be the one to go talk to him since it bothered her so much. I ignored it while she made a whole mockery of it and has made me feel like I'm the bad guy. So currently we are still not talking to each other avoiding each other...\n\nTherefore, AITA for not talking to my former coworker about how uncomfortable the smirking/laughing is towards us or should she be the one to talk to him about it...\n\n**Update** Former coworker is male and I am a male", "created_utc": 1689215493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14y87re/aita_for_not_standing_up_for_my_female_coworker/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would \u201cthey think we are having sex\u201d be the first thing out of your mouth?? Not \u201cdating\u201d not \u201clike each other\u201d- you went straight to sex. That\u2019s just weird and uncomfortable. And also, you should have address it with the weirdo intern/coworker whoever IMMEDIATELY. And if they didn\u2019t stop, you escalate it to their manager or HR. It\u2019s pretty simple, really.", "YTA. You still don't get it from the way you are framing the main issue as you not defending her. YOU made her uncomfortable by telling her the co-worker's smirk was about you two having sex. Imagine how blindsided she must have been by that sudden shift into the sexual if she thought you were just friends all along. \n\nAlso, why are you so sure that is what your co-worker is thinking and how do you know he'll say something that will make things worse? What exactly have you or anyone else been telling him about her?", "YTA. Not because you didn't immediately say something to your male coworker about his childlike behavior, but because you don't understand why you need to now.\n\nIt's not easy to be a woman in the workplace - constantly being sexualized, undermined, misread, overlooked. Your male coworker is taking every opportunity to sexualize her (and thus, undermine her position in her workplace) by laughing/smirking whenever the two of you talk. You're a man, and men admire men who have sex. That is not the case for women. \n\nIf she's being interpreted as a woman who sleeps around with coworkers, that could cost her her social & career mobility. Unfortunately for woman, but fortunately for you, you don't face the same level of judgement. So yeah, talk to your male coworker. He's an immature dick.\n\n\\*Edit - typo", "YTA - YOU knew the intern/weirdo, not her, and you quickly assumed his behavior was about you and female coworker having sex.  That's weird that would be your first thought.  Makes it seem like you were okay with the insinuation . You should have told him to knock it off.  You owe Female coworker an apology.", "YTA.\n\nThat dude was being a little weirdo and you did nothing to stop it. It made your coworker/friend upset, and you still failed to confront that weasel the next time he snickered from afar.", "YTA. \n\nThat behavior from male coworker is childish, harassing, and all around ignorant. I hope your former friend goes to HR.  Shit like that can destroy careers. Even in this day and age rumors about women being loose or messing with coworkers is damaging. You should have told him to knock it off or nip that shot in the bud. Him taking a photo was miles over the line.", "YTA. \n1. you are adults, someone taking photos of you without your consent is misconduct that needs to be addressed by either of you.\n\n2. You are in an environment where you  have a history with this guy. You have a rapour, meaning you could address things more efficiently. (You know his personality, etc). If he isn't receptive, you could just escalate it to HR.\n\n3. women have to face a lot of sexism in the workplace.  She might get accused of sleeping her way up/ sleeping around to be suncessful, and this isn't helping.\n\n4. your female coworker is less likely to be taken seriously by addressing it by someone willing to take unsolicited photos of her. Not addressing it could also put her in a compromising situation, resulting from  someone thinking she's easy just because she was talking with you.\n\n\n\nSometimes, YOU need to stand up and do the right thing. Even if everyone involved is an adult.", "YTA. So much weird shit in this story. Who just starts taking pictures of two people he's not particularly close to right in front of their faces? And why didn't either of you ask what he was doing? And why was your immediate assumption that he was thinking you two were having sex instead of something like that you two like each other?\n\nYou say he was your former intern, so you obviously have more of a rapport with him than she does. After she told you she was bothered by him thinking that about you two, you should've cleared things up with him.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't care about her reputation or that false rumors would flow? You knew him but didn't ask the AH if he had a problem the first time he started smirking nor did you tell him to stop with the pictures? \n\nYes, she could say something, but you actually knew him and were going to act as if it were normal. What an AH!", "YTA\n\nOf course your former intern is thinking that you a and your female co-worker are having sex, that's why he's laughing and smirking at both of you whenever he sees you two. You need to tell him to knock that shit off and tell him not to take anymore pictures. \n\nThe faster you do it, the faster any rumors if not already won't spread around because you chose not to say anything.", "YTA - you like that your buddy thinks your boning your colleague and you have little respect for her, else you would have told him to knock off.", "YTA. You showed by your (in)actions that you are ok with a coworker thinking she\u2019s having sex with you, that you are ok with a coworker taking pictures of her (to show whom?), and that you don\u2019t respect her enough to set the record straight.\n\nShe\u2019s smart to block you, and smart to not engage about anything non-work related, especially outside of work hours. You cannot be trusted.", "YTA Are you male/female/nb? Anyway, it was weird you said the sex comment to your friend and yes, you should have stood up to him. You owe your friend an apology", "YTA, sounds to me that you like that assumption", "I would\u2019ve confronted the coworker myself in this situation but I still would\u2019ve cut you off & judged you for not doing anything. YTA. Coworker is laughing at you too.", "YTA for not immediately calling him out on the first smirk and photo. You could likely report him to HR for taking the picture (as needed). But you should've addressed it right then and there with her as a witness.", "Slight YTA for not stepping up after she specifically said she wished you had done so. Other coworker is a jerk, and he should be put in his place. You putting him in his place, especially in front of the woman and other coworkers for effect, would go a long way toward repairing your relationship with her.", "Yta.\n\nConflicts of interest and dating in the workplace can turn very bad and serious very quickly.\n\nAll it takes is a rumor for someone to go off the hr and make up entire lies that get people fired even with investigating.\n\nYour former intern is being a weird ass freak and you should be confronting them about it to see wtf is up.  Misunderstanding someone's working relationship is a huge issue especially if you work in corporate environments.\n\nYour coworker is only protecting herself from that potential issue and you have no idea how much more at risk women are than men to be fired in the work place for misconduct over rumors like this.", "YTA. Yes you didn\u2019t tell former coworker anything but you did nothing to make him stop or think otherwise. Standing by is almost just as bad. For a guy it may not seem like a big deal \u201clet them talk\u201d. But for a girl it is so hard to be taken seriously in the professional world. We have to fight for respect that is freely given to most men. All it takes is one stupid rumor to lose all respect and credibility. Silence is often taken as confirmation of rumors. To her you are appearing as either cowardly or proud that someone assumes you\u2019re together. The fact that you\u2019re upset with her and not the bonehead ex coworker speaks volumes to me.", "INFO: Was your coworker female?", "YTA. You are not in High school anymore.  Grow a spine and talk with your extremely unprofessional coworker", "Yta", "YTA. Why wouldn\u2019t you look at this guy and tell him you guys are friends & that\u2019s all.? Or even to stop with his childish behavior because it is making her uncomfortable. You owe her an apology because you are an asshole of a friend", "YTA wow.", "YTA. Throwing her under the bus like that was chickenshittery of the highest order. You are too old to be letting this high school bullshit slide.", "YTA this guy was being a creep and could ruin her reputation with a rumor. Instead of defending her or telling HR or confronting the guy later you did nothing. You aren't her friend you did nothing to show her you respect her or your friendship. I would distance myself from you to because in your complicity in your other male coworker\u2019s behavior, you show her you are 100% okay with people making rumors about you two. You won't see those repercussions but she will.", "Your smirking coworker is really gross. I don't think you're an ah, but I can understand where the female coworker is coming from.", "YTA\n\nWhat a creepy little intern. \n\nDon\u2019t speak with him directly, though. That would never be the right idea. \n\nYou should both submit a written complaint to HR.", "NTA, but as it involves you directly I do think something being said would be appropriate. If not with the smirking coworker then HR. \n\nI say NTA because I don\u2019t think you did anything actually wrong, it\u2019s just not how I personally think it should have been handled.  \n\nWhat the smirking coworker is doing isn\u2019t ok at all and they need a talking to. It\u2019s contributing to a hostile work environment.  Somebody needs to say something. Perhaps if that somebody is you that would mend some fences.", "YTA.\n\nYour problem is that you have low standards for yourself. You are willing to let the negative consequences of your decisions land entirely on others, without raising a finger to fix a problem you helped create unless there's something in it for you or you're being personally inconvenienced. That is the root cause of all your problems. Your co-workers have noticed this about you and it's why they don't respect you. Sadly this lady didn't pick up on it before treating you like a prospect. Now they have transferred their lack of respect to her.\n\nYou and this woman were both behaving indiscreetly enough for others to notice. You created the problem together and have a 50/50 share of the blame. Trouble is, the consequences are 100% on her and 0 on you, because that's how it usually goes when someone's trying to dip his pen in company ink. (Life isn't fair.) You then made her problem far worse when you dumped 100% of the onus for dealing with the fallout onto her, and blithely went on your way. (This is not how an adult behaves.)\n\nYou did not go with your female colleague to address your former intern's bad behavior or to report the harassment. You knew the behavior was continuing and affecting her badly, you knew your own actions were a factor, but you still did nothing since it wasn't affecting you. You left her holding the bag.\n\nWhen you dump a problem on someone else to solve and take no responsibility, you don't get to cry victim about the actions the other person takes to solve the problem. You can't have it both ways.", "NTA  but that's so childish.  You both should have gone to HR.", "ESH the weird guy for being weird. You for not trying to shut down weird guy and your comment about weird guy thinks you\u2019re having sex. Your female co-working for accusing you of spreading rumours about her.", "NTA. Why does it bother her so much if it's not true? Also are we sure the guy wasn't joking because it seems weird that he would assume that sort of thing. I would've probably laughed it off, personally. Maybe she's bothered that people might think she's a lesbian? Idk. Seems weird to be so offended by that and to let it ruin a friendship.", "NTA just talk to the dude and if it doesn't stop then report him to whoever this should not be you having to protect her. She is capable of talking to him or talking to a higher up.", "ESH because you should have addressed it from the beginning, and once he stated his nonsense, you should have taken it to HR to complain. He is sexually harassing both of you.\n\nShe should have also addressed the smirking and called out his unprofessional behavior and reported to HR.", "NTA. Maybe you should have told him to knock it off, but he wasn't doing anything explicitly wrong. It's risky to confront someone at work without a solid basis.\n\nShe's also NTA. Not that you did much wrong, but the situation might have just made her realize that she doesn't want to be perceived that way at work, even if there is no truth to it.", "ESH:\n\nYou are slightly an asshole because it would have been very easy to simply take your male coworker aside after the first incident and say \"it's platonic and stop being an idiot\".\n\nYour male coworker is obviously a huge asshole.\n\nYour female friend/coworker is slipping into AH territory because she's overreacting and blaming you for something you *really* didn't have control over when it happened.", "nta", "Right, when people have laughed or giggled or made insinuating looks at me and a male friend, I've always taken it as them thinking that we like each other or that we're dating or about to start dating. My mind doesn't immediately jump to sex.", "Men say that cause WE ASSUMED that we don't go \"oh they're dating\" we go \"ya they're fucking\" NOT ALL MEN DO THIS THO!!!", "Yeah, what an incredibly odd thing to say. If I was the female coworker, my thought process would be - what a bizarre thing for OP to be confident about. I guess that means the jerk has told OP before that he thinks we're having sex, why else would OP think that. And if he's told OP about it and is still doing it then I guess OP didn't tell him to knock it off.", "Exactly this is extremely unprofessional behavior and creating a very toxic work environment. Gross snickering and smirking yuck how old are these people.", "Let's be honest, I think OP liked the idea of people thinking they were having sex. He's just upset the illusion isn't turning into a reality because she caught on and removed his predatorial ass to the curb.", "It almost seems as if him saying \"he thinks were having sex\" was his way of testing the waters with her. Like, he is interested in more, but doesn't want to go through the hassle of dating/asking her out. 3rd coworker's behavior was a way to bring up sex without it coming from op, so wHy Is She sO mAD? He's a creep.", "This needs to be the top comment.", "She did Nothing either. So just because OP is a guy, the onus is completely on him? fk that retrograde shit.", "Thanks for the input. This issue has been bothering me for the past couple weeks because my female coworker friend abruptly blocked me off of all socials and basically think I don't exist anymore just because of this incident...", "The photo thing really threw me off. OP doesn't sound like he's particularly close to the male coworker. For someone who doesn't know you that well to take a photo of you and someone they don't know at all is weird as hell.", "Because why should it be his job to stop something that bothers her. And people will think there FUCKING if he more than if doesn't will they not?\n\nI love how people INSTEAD OF ANSWERING my question they downvote me oof", "I'm sorry I updated the post, I'm a male and my former coworker who was smirking/laughing at us is a male. \n\nI simply just ignored it thinking that it'll just pass and what not but my female coworker was bothered and uncomfortable about the situation. My initial thought was if it bothered her so much why doesnt she go and talk to him about it?? Why rely on me to go talk to him if she can go do it herself?", "Former coworker is a male", ">I say NTA because I don\u2019t think you did anything actually wrong, it\u2019s just not how I personally think it should have been handled.\n\nI completely agree the coworker is the asshole here everyone else is just reacting to it and getting caught in the middle of his bullshit", "When this get to HR, if they are not gender bias, this hostile working environment talk will have to included all parties involved including cowoker & her friends.\n\nThey are behave like highschoolers which i could understand on former intern part.", ">Why does it bother her so much if it's not true?\n\nMaybe because women are judged for this kind of thing and she doesn't want to deal with being harassed in her workplace? This kind of rumor has ruined women's careers.", "OP is a male.", "Honestly this doesn't make sense. OP doesn't state their sex, but why would you automatically assume he is laughing because he thinks you are having sex. It is really a big leap assumption.", "He\u2019s not towing the line or being respectful of their friendship, why is she an AH for ending a friendship with someone who didn't respect her? He knew the intern, he could have ended it then and there on the first interaction when he saw his \u201cfriend\u201d was uncomfortable... He chose no to.", "My first thought would be that I have something in my teeth lol. \n\nUnless these people are high school aged, it\u2019s honestly weird at all that anyone is pointing and laughing and giggling because they think that coworkers are hooking up or dating or flirting, or whatever. But they are in their 30s? And the intern is probably at least in his 20s right? \n\nBoth the intern and OPs behavior was weird AF based on the context of age and setting", "You might think that in your head but my point it why would you say it like that to your coworker? \n\nEven just saying \u201cmaybe he thinks we\u2019re having sex\u201d can be considered harassment because he\u2019s saying it to a coworker in response to her just asking why someone else is being weird. \n\nEven if he thought it he should have the sense not to say it out loud to her at work, that\u2019s why it\u2019s weird for him to say it like that with no filter.", "It has more to do with op having a prior relationship with the guy than it being a gender thing but go off.", "You injected gender into an argument that had nothing to do with it. You\u2019re projecting.", "You think it's just bothering you? Newsflash buddy, as a female she'd suffer far more harassment than you because you chose not to speak up.", "ESH. Your female coworker could clear the air too. You should have reacted, I mean he smirked?! Come on, I'd have talked to him on the spot. And the ex intern? So immature. \nAt this stage, I would talk to ex intern and tell him that attitudes like that in a workplace are not ok and that next time he makes the office a hostile environment, it'll be HR.", "I would have done that too.", "My a** would have been in HR as soon as that happened. That is terrifying.", "1. You already have a working relationship with this coworker/former intern \n2. She has told you multiple times she feels uncomfortable - since you apparently don\u2019t and this is someone you have seemingly been forming a friendship with why would you not set the record straight with this intern to make her more comfortable \n3. Women are often not believed. Our word is doubted, dismissed, minimized. \n\nLastly the fact that you don\u2019t see any of this former interns behavior as worthy of a direct conversation about professionalism in the workplace at minimum, if not an HR conversation is deeply troubling. YTA", "True. I guess I was thinking about it more like they were all friends and maybe he was joking around but now that I'm reevaluating the situation I agree with what you're saying. I definitely don't think OP is an AH. The coworker who was taking photos of them is, though.", "I wasnt trying to assume he was joking, that's why I asked if maybe he was because if he was being serious that seems immature and just weird/uncomfortable. Knowing he took photos of them too crosses a line and was so inappropriate. Also I apologize for somehow misunderstanding and thinking they're both female. Idk how I did that and it was 100% my fault! \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab", "Sorry I updated the post. I'm a male and my former coworker is a male.\n\nThat was my first assumption because he was sitting there and just purposely smirking/laughing at us making us feel uncomfortable. Plus he was also taking pictures of us. Do you think I should go talk to him about it and see why he was smirking/laughing at us?", "It's definitely weird behavior especially since they're at the workplace and it doesn't sound like OP or the female coworker is a close friend of this guy. Taking pictures is way over-the-top.", "That's what he thought. I like to be blunt and that gets me in trouble. And as the intern being a guy I'm sure he was spot on too sadly. I see your point I'm curious what would be a better response? Just he thinks we're dating?", "Oh yeah because they were best of friends, right? That intern was a work acquaintance, and if she felt uncomfortable at her workplace, the onus is equally on her to confront/report him, not just OP.", "In that case how is the onus, SINGULARLY on him to \"say something\"?", "So why didn't she speak up?", "And why do you think that WOULDN'T Confirm the rumors for people and for him? Just a question.", "Why wouldn't the very first thing you do when someone takes a picture of you without permission is to ask them wtf they are doing?", "Yes I think that might be a good idea. Also I'm sorry, somehow I misread and thought youre both females. After rereading I'm not sure how I thought that. That's super rude of him to take photos like that. I hate when people take photos without my permission (mostly because I am not photogenic at all lol). But why the hell would he be taking photos of you together, that is so weird and awkward. If anyone is the AH it's him. Hopefully if you do all him about it he can actually be mature and honest with you.", "Grow up.", "1.) They have a history\n\n2.) OP is the one who made it weird by bringing up the idea of them having sex, and then projecting it onto their stalker\n\n3.) The OP noticed that the first time he didn\u2019t say anything, it upset his coworker. He then was upset she iced him out. He gets another opportunity to redeem himself. He chooses cowardice again. \n\n4.) OP is making a coworker uncomfortable at the work place. The coworker pulls him aside, voices her concerns sincerely and honestly, and makes a reasonable request for OP to fix the situation. He chooses not to. Ethics aside, it\u2019s at the very least a potential HR issue.\n\n5.) He said they were friends.\n\nBut if you\u2019re that desperate for a gender-related reason to complain about:\n\n6.) Social stigma surrounding women, sex, and the workplace is drastically different than it is for men.\n\nEdit: Formatting. Also, no one ever said \u201cthe onus was singularly on him\u201d but I thought you needed to be walked through why OP is TA here.", "Thanks for saying this. \n\nI can only speak for myself but in the few times where a man has been creepy with me and made me uncomfortable, my throat honestly closes up so tight that I can\u2019t even speak. It\u2019s pretty normal for women to feel very scared in situations like that and it can really trigger your  fight/flight response, and trying to advocate for yourself like a normal human is really hard when your brain is in full blown lizard mode."]}
