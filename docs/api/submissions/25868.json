This is normal meeting etiquet.  He should have stuck to the scheduel", "ESH - Why are both of you so eager to jump into blaming each other for what is a very minor situation. The 30 minutes the call went over didn't stop you from hanging out with your friend, so why did he immediately have to assign blame for the 30 minutes? Why did you have to get upset about lunch being a half hour late? He offered to cancel the call. You said no. He made the call. The coaching session was scheduled for an hour, but it's not unusual for coaching sessions to be shorter or longer than the scheduled time. Expecting him to end the coaching session after exactly an hour isn't reasonable, but, again, so what?", "INFO: Why didn't you and your friend go without him and he could meet you later or after? You were with your friend, why not focus on catching up? Take a walk around the block? Have a quick snack while you wait?\n\nLunch with friends doesn't pay the bills.  Part of adulting is patience and understanding. \n\n>I told him not to because it's only an hour and would be disrespectful to his client to cancel on such short notice.\n\nIt's disrespectful to cancel, but NOT disrespectful to cut off his client?\n\nYTA. I'm not sure I understand all the other votes.  Is this his job/ business? Does he get paid for his coaching sessions? If so, calls run long.  Part of business is client relationships and professionalism. Is he still trying to establish himself in his field? Gain more clients through referrals? He offered to cancel, and you said no. Now you're mad that his call ran long??", "ESH. Your BF has offered to cancel the appointment in advance. Sometimes things come up that will make the time to extend. This has happened a couple of times when i am on call with my client. Given that, you shouldn't be getting angry with him that this happened. At the same time, the least thing that he can do is apologise for the call extending.", "ESH. You told him it was ok when he offered, life happened, he blamed you. It sounds like a LOT of overreacting on everyone\u2019s part. Plans are allowed to change.", "Life happens. Sometimes meetings overrun. Sometimes, it would be bad form to cancel on a client at late notice. Sometimes we have our lunch late. And that's ok.\n\nBlame doesn't need to be allocated for everything. Not everything needs someone to be T A. But I am going to say ESH for all the blame and fault talk you both seem to do.", "NTA. My husband has a lot of client meetings and when we make plans, he always make sure to end his calls on time. It was disrespectful of him to go over.", "ESH. You are both at fault here and your shared desire to shift the blame over something so minor is pretty troubling.", "NTA. You had every right to expect your BF to finish the call in the allotted time or soon after. Part of working with clients on the phone is having boundaries on your paid time. If he had had another client scheduled at 2 pm, he probably would have found a way to finish up without a problem. He was the AH.", "NTA,\n\nYour boyfriend didn't set boundaries that he should have.  He was very selfish in not ending his call on time.", "NAH.\n\nIt's a business where \"shit happens\" sometimes and you need to go over. It's one lunch.  Move on.", "NTA.  If he had something \\_he\\_ wanted to do that call would have ended exactly at the end of the hour.  He extended it because \"meh, it's just my GF and her friend\".", "YTA. You have no idea that his call going long was his fault. You had a chance to say yes when he asked if he should cancel. Things come up on work calls so a little flexibility is key.", "The disrespectful part was blaming you for it.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But was his \"accusation\" precipitated by you blaming him and being annoyed etc? Because yeah not a great thing to say, but who cares? It's not like he left you guys standing in front of a restaurant in the rain for half an hour? It sounds like you were comfortable, hung out together and just waited for half an hour. And you could have gotten an apple or something if the hunger was that bad.  \nIt seems like a completely normal thing to happen in every day life that should not get you guys at each others' throats. Chill out, both of you.", "You make great points, I\u2019m not trying to blame him. I\u2019m just confused as to why he put all the blame on me? I thought it was unreasonable. To me it\u2019s less about blame and more about taking responsibility. I was ok with taking some responsibility but he refused to take any", "We didn\u2019t go without him because he told me that he really wanted to come. The reason why I\u2019m upset is because he placed all the blame on me and said it was my fault why we were late. Which I don\u2019t agree with. \n\nI understand that things come up in meetings. But ending a session at the end of a session is not rude, imo. And I don\u2019t understand how that\u2019s \u201ccutting his client off\u201d", "I can understand if it were a business meeting. But this was a scheduled session with a set time. If it were a variable time then I would have gone without him or asked him to cancel. I\u2019m not sure how I was supposed to accept all responsibility for us being late?", "30 additional minutes to a 1 hour session is not a \u201clittle\u201d flexibility. And the problem is he put all the blame on me for us being late.", "Who got mad first? Did he come out of the meeting mad? Or did you get mad at him first because his call ran 30 minutes late?  \n\nThis seems like a situation where he should\u2019ve apologized for running late and that should\u2019ve been the end of it. I don\u2019t know why anyone had to be the asshole in this situation.\n\nEta - my husband sometimes works from home. I\u2019ve heard him try to end calls thinking everything was wrapped up when the other person remembers something else they need to discuss or need help with. It does happen that meetings can run long.", "Maybe\u2026 but you don\u2019t know what was happening on that session. He had no control perhaps. \n\nAlso did you say anything about being late? Because if there was any insinuating that you were late he might have taken that to mean you were blaming him. If nothing was said about the timing and how hungry you were, then it\u2019s on him for blaming you. But if you said anything about the timing and how hungry you were, I\u2019m putting it on you. Again, he gave you the chance to have him cancel", "Neither of us were initially mad. I was definitely annoyed but more happy that we were finally eating. I made a comment at lunch because he said something about being hangry. And I told him we would have been here sooner if he didn\u2019t go over. And he immediately brought up that he asked if he should cancel it the day before and it was my fault for saying no. I told him that I didn\u2019t think it was all my fault. But he continued to say \u201cno it\u2019s all your fault. It\u2019s not my fault\u201d. I got upset because he said it was all my fault when I didn\u2019t think there should have been any blame for the situation. It was what it was.", "It sounds like your comment put him on the defense. He is to blame for his call going over even though that can happen at times. In my opinion, he should\u2019ve apologized for running late and it should\u2019ve been dropped. It wasn\u2019t all your fault. \n\nI think in the future, it may be good to allow for a bit more time between events if he has a call. It\u2019s been my experience that if you have things scheduled back to back, theres always a chance something will happen that could make you late to the second event."]}
