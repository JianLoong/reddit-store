She refused to do any prenup and refuse to compromise on anything related to finance. It's basically her way or no way.\nI do not trust others to manage my finance, so I said I need her to earn my trust by showing me how well she can actually managed herself financially. She said no, but eventually maybe (Never happened even when we are engaged).\n\nShe also insists that whatever she saved up on her own until marriage is solely her money.\nI found it very unfair how whatever I saved up somehow she is entitled to it, while herself wouldn't see her saving as family property.\nShe said that I am a man, and it's my role and responsibility, and that there is no fairness in this world. Apparently I shouldn't think about divorce at all and I shouldn't even worry about it, but in my opinion she is basically protecting herself from the case of divorce.\n\nThen strangely she came at me a few months ago and set a deadline for marriage. Never once asked if I am ready or financially okay since interest rate keep climbing.  She needs the diamond ring but the deadline paid by me.\nI really love her so I still proposed. At the end, we went to register for an appointment to sign the official paper for marriage. The very same day, our parents met and I heard how her parents believe in the Chinese tradition where the groom side of family must pay them money to be able to marry their daughter.\nI felt really uncomfortable, she is asking for all the financial power in the relationship, she wants the house, she wants to keep her money, and they think I need to pay them money to get to marry their daughter. I decided to draw the line today and broke up the very next day, I was shouted at by her family, because apparently I am looking down on them by thinking that they are money driven. They called me cheap and irresponsible for cancelling the marriage.\n Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1690519131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bnfth/aita_for_cancelling_a_marriage_with_my_fiance/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're offended because you noticed, not because they aren't money driven.", "As a Chinese I'm kinda just giggling hahahaha.\n\nAll you've said is true for only the most purist Chinese people in China but it's still quite rare to meet people who really follow through with those. It's an overreaction to the fact that women are scarce in China due to the previous one child policy and thus kinda allowed more leeway.\n\nBut the part of the guy being responsible for all things financial is typical of Asian countries, not just China. \n\nDivorce is a kinda taboo still in some countries. She sounds like she had a very traditional upbringing even though she's a working woman.\n\nWhen Chinese say there is no fairness in the world it's actually one of the more mercenary proverbs we have. There is no real fairness because who holds the power decides what's fair. \n\nIn this case, you can agree that there's no fairness in the world but you also have the power to refuse to marry and give up your power to her. \n\nJust be thankful she was so upfront about this before the marriage hahahahahaha.", "NTA. Sounds like you saved yourself an expensive divorce. Who cares what her family thinks and, quite frankly, who cares what she thinks. They sound like monsters.", "NTA but yeah you need to leave and not look back.  This relationship isn't right for either of you.", "NTA - you dodged a bullet here.\n\nI hope you realize that this woman does not love you, she wants your hard earned money and traps you. Do not fall for it.", "NTA. It sounds like you tried to have multiple conversations with her about finding a compromise that works for both of you.  You couldn't come to an agreement,  I think that is a reasonable dealbreaker. I say that as someone who believes in shared finances with my spouse.", "NTA. The idea that what's hers is hers and what's yours is ALSO hers is insane. Pretty sure shouty inlaws were planning on moving in after the marriage.", "NTA. This is a very weird situation. You probably should\u2019ve discussed money before getting engaged tho", "Red flags all the way....", "NTA they are money driven. Simple as that.", "NTA. Sounds like she was setting you up to financially abuse you. Glad you got out when you did.", "You saw the red flags and bailed. If finance issues are an issue now imagine what it will be like later.  You say that you love her but does she truly love you. \n\nWhat it reads from this post is that she is protecting herself in case of a divorce already. But she is protecting herself. You don\u2019t seem to be in the equation.  \n\nShe not ready for marriage. Let her go. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Run fast and run far. That's not how a partnership works.", "NTA.\n\nIt seems like she is taking advantage of your money and so is her family.", "NTA\n\nThey are money driven and hoped you would just sweep it under the rug.", "Did you sign those papers?", "NTA.   \nYou must have the patience of a saint to have lasted that long.", "NTA. You said it yourself, it's her way or no way. Her way is sexist and borderline misandry. She wants you to give everything you have to her, give nothing in return, and is emotionally manipulating you to get it.\n\nPick the no way route. Do not marry anyone you aren't sure about 100%.", "NTA - she is a walking red flag, & it's good that you recognized that & got out of the relationship", "NTA. Follow the standard that premarital assets stay with each person individually. Any equity gained in the house, or any other asset, is a marital asset.\n\nPay household bills according to income.", "NTA\n\nmy lord, you saved urself.", "There is honouring traditions and then there is literal robbery.\n\nYour situation was the latter.\n\nI am sorry bud, but the entire family was just after your money/belongings. Run while you still can and find a partner who appreciates you for who you are, not how much you have in your bank account.\n\nI might get roasted for saying something this bleak, but don't care. Every SECOND marriage these days ends in divorce.\nHaving a prenup/keeping seperate accounts is just for both your safety. It makes the divorce process much easier on everyone.\n\nTo be clear tho. I have nothing against making a seperate joint account. Buying some things together and such. But major assets should be seperate. Everyone is allowed to have their own money for purchases and activities.\n\nA healthy compromise is everyone pays a set amount into the joint account to cover expenses related to living together and such. But the remaining money in each's account is only theirs and they decide what to do with it. It gives both Parties equal amounts of responsibility and freedom. Also treats them as equals.\n\nPlease stay safe bud. You dodged a major bullet. I bet you are a lovely person. Please dont let yourself be used as a doormat again. You deserve better.", "NTA. Idk I think what sounds cheap to me is to expect what\u2019s yours is hers but not vice versa. So many red flags here. Also, her parents suck. \n\nYou did the right thing!!! She sounds way too money hungry and it\u2019s really gross how she went about it. Me and my husband don\u2019t even have a joint account but we will eventually have one just for groceries and bills, but I like the idea of having my own money and him having his own. Either decision is fine but it should be a MUTUAL agreement. She tried to control everything.", "NTA. Never marry someone with the, \u201cWhat\u2019s mine is mine and what\u2019s yours is mine\u201d bs.\nGlad you came to your senses.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry it turned out this way, but it\u2019s probably for the best. Sharing everything works for some, but not all. She said she wasn\u2019t willing to share her own savings though. I would be uncomfortable as well!", "Nta- congratulations, don't look back.", "You are NTA. I wouldn\u2019t marry her either. Find someone who is your equal and don\u2019t get engaged until you have discussed and agreed upon all of these matters.", "You\u2019re being smart. Finally. I mean you ignored all the red flags literally slapping you in the head, but yeah, you finally wised up. Stay smart, block her and her greedy parents, and never ever date a gold digger again. Just date women the opposite of her and you\u2019ll be fine. NTA", "NTa for calling off the wedding. Why would you continue to date and get engaged when you knew that you were not compatible and this was an issue? That's just foolish. Hopefully you've learnt a valuable lesson.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised you let it get that far before drawing a line. You barely dodged that bullet.", "NTA. Better a broken engagement than a broken marriage which is nightmare in paperwork.", "NTA. she wanted all your financial info, but didn't want to share any of her financial info or resources with you.", "Run.
