I work & go to school in a smallish college town, but have a small regional airport in the area. I also live several states away from dad and stepmom. I was in my last hour of my shift when I get a text from my stepmom: nephew and his fianc\u00e9e were coming back from vacation and their flight got diverted to our airport. She asked me how soon I could go pick them up and take them to their hotel room, so that way they don't have to pay for an uber. \n\nHere's the thing though: her nephew used to treat me as an outsider when I was younger, because I am technically step-family to him. It really hurt my feelings growing up, and step mom would always tell me to just let it go and get over it. Yet, if I ever were to do that to someone in her family, shed demand I apologize. My dad would always agree with her. I believe my stepmoms a narcissist, as she still has a tendency to volunteer me to o things for her whenever I visit; I just don't believe she has any respect for me or my boundaries whatsoever. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here's how I responded: \n\n\"You know what? No. (Nephew's name) hasn't always been very nice to me, so why should I go out of my way to accommodate him all of a sudden?\"\n\nSM: \"But they need your help! He was just a kid when he said those things, he's changed now. Cant you just help him this one time?\"\n\nMe: \"No. I'm a graduate student who works full time. I do not run a taxi service, let alone a free one. If you want to help him so badly, why don't you order them an uber ride yourself?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSM then goes on about how its so unfair of me to hold a grudge against how he was \"as a child\", but he wasn't \\*really\\* a child, he was in high school. Besides, the last time I saw him, he was still pretty rude to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1676934055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117nf0q/aita_for_refusing_to_pick_my_stepmoms_nephew_up/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good on you establishing a boundary. Also if you can afford a plane ticket you can afford an Uber. Not to mention most airlines have some compensation for diverts.", "NTA\n\nI probably would have responded in the same way. In any case, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got plans to relax after work. Taking someone from the airport to a hotel is cutting into your relaxing time. You\u2019ve no obligations to your stepmother\u2019s nephew.", "NTA\n\nLike you said you're not a taxi service. If you don't feel like picking them up it's end of discussion. \n\nBesides, how does it make sense for you to go out off your way,  devote time and resources to be their chauffeur when something like Uber exists?  It just transfers cost from them to you.", "NTA. We teach people how to treat us. He taught you and you're just drawing a boundary based on your experience.\n\nUber isn't that expensive, lol, and honestly it's pretty nervy your stepmom to just expect for you to drop everything out of the blue like that.", "NTA. You hit the nail squarely on the head when you told stepmom to pay for an uber for him. Stick to your guns on this one or she'll be rolling all over you for the rest of her life.  \nSide note: Even though your Dad may never stand up to her, he may be secretly proud of you for doing so. Don't confront him about it, but keep an eye on his reactions whenever you do.", "NTA and good for you sticking up for yourself.", "NTA.  \n\nIt could be that your mom wants this  favor so she looks good to his mom.\n\nYour suggestion that she order them the Uber is perfect. Otherwise, let these supposed adults figure it out for themselves.", "Certainly NTA. She didn\u2019t even ask you but expected you to give a free ride to them. They are grown ass adults. If they needed a ride, they can figure it out on their own. Also, your stepmom knowing what happened but just brushing it off as \u201cbut he was so young.\u201d Ma\u2019am, please.", "NTA good for you! You don't owe them anything", "NTA. But I wouldn\u2019t give that much information in the future to your step-mom, she may use it against you. I would just say \u201cNo I\u2019m working. They can call an Uber\u201d. Sorry she treats you this way!", "NTA for several reasons.\n\n1. She gave you hardly any notice whatsoever and therefore it is reasonable to expect someone to be busy.\n2. The couple obviously have money because they are travelling. Taking an Uber isn't going to bankrupt them and if they can't afford an Uber, they shouldn't be travelling.\n3. You owe nobody airport runs, even people you are close to.\n4. Most importantly, they have disrespected you for years. You are entitled to make and maintain boundaries. They don't get to use you when it suits them. \n\nI can tell having a backbone isn't genetic because your father needs to grow one and stand up for his own daughter and stop putting his wife first and allow you to be disrespected.\n\nAt this point I would've just ignored the text message (or not open it, if it was on Whatsapp) and pretend to have not read it.", "NTA - OP, perfect response.  If she brings it up again, don't even make it about the past. Make it about now... I work and study full time. I don't have time for this.", "NTA. Step mom can do it herself", "NTA. It's her nephew, let her pick him up or make arrangements. You owe them nothing.", "NTA\n\nAll you did here was match his energy. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, I think it was outrageous that your step mom even asked you.", "If she wouldn't go and get him or pay for an Uber, or make him pay for one, why on earth expect you to down tools and get him?? NTA", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t have even answered her. Next time leave her on read.", "NTA, but you need to learn that \"No\" is a complete sentence. \n\nThe more you try to justify and explain your \"no\", all you're really doing is giving them fodder to argue back or find reasons why your no should be a yes and then it becomes more dramatic than just leaving it at \"no\" would have been.", "NTA.  I would have relied.  \u201cI\u2019m working and unable to help.  They need to call an Uber\u201d.", "NTA at all, your stepmom seems to be the kid of woman that forces everyone to go with her whims and gets mad if you ever tell them no, you did good at explaining your reasoning and I'm assuming the nephew never apologized for his shit behavior (something everyone learns as a little kid), I'm sure these kind of situations will keep happening with her so being firm is the best option here.", "NTA Even if he had a been totally different towards you growing up, it isn\u2019t your job to fetch her family. Ubers are all over and it would not be abnormal to get one to take him where he needs to go.", "NTA- you don't think of him as your brother really so the whole \"it's family\" thing doesn't even work. She didn't offer to pay you for gas and it's wild that she assumed that your schedule was wide open enough to randomly pick someone up from the airport. I wouldn't have responded like that but hey you were well within reasonable boundaries.", "NTA but you really didn't need to poke the anthill. All you had to do was say you were too busy and he should get an Uber or taxi.", "NTA", "NTA, you stood up for yourself.", "NTA. Even regardless of the background info, your SM (and your dad) can\u2019t expect you to drop work and studies just to play free taxi.", "NTA", "NTA. You said it best Not a Taxi. Even without the history.", ">She asked me how soon I could go pick them up and take them to their hotel room, so that way they don't have to pay for an uber.\n\nHow her son treated you is irrelevant - it is not your responsibility to pay for fuel so that *he* can avoid paying for an uber.\n\nYou shot yourself in the foot by bringing up childhood, for she began to fixate on that.\n\nYour reason was nothing to do with childhood - you were being asked to lose money so that he could gain money. You created the idea that there was a childhood imbalance unnecessarily - if she had asked you to do the same for a total stranger you'd have said \"no\" on the same basis, despite the fact that stranger had not treated you one way or another when you were a child.\n\nYou'd be well within the bounds of good moral sense to tell your stepmom that exposing a person to the idea that other adults owe them money for no reason is poisonous to their good character, and that if she instead made it clear that her son was responsible for paying for his own transportation he would be a better person for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
