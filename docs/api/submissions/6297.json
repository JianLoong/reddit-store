I would suggest (when possible) maybe drop off groceries or offer to pay a utility bill.", "NTA you sound like a kind generous person. The cousin thought.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI bet she spent the money you gave her for everything but the son. Did you also see with your own eyes if he's taken care of? If not, maybe a call to CPS might be necessary.", "NTA, but I wouldn't announce it. Just live your merry life and when she complains or turns on the waterworks next time, tell her you're not in a position to help right now. Don't even let on that you know about the car. Whatever you usually have to give, put in investments or savings. If you're not comfortable just saying no, play along that like you were actually going to ask her if she can spot you because you're having a rough patch, but were a bit too prideful. People don't approach people who are likely to ask for it back or ask them for money.", "NTA, you have no obligation to help her just because it\u2019s hard to raise a kid. It\u2019s her kid, the only people who have to do anything are her and the father.", "NTA - not even a little bit.  If she can afford to buy her boyfriend's affections, she can afford to take care of her kid.  I'm sorry you got used, and by family even - that's a kicked-in-the-gut feeling.   Take care.", "Don't you see, she didn't buy the Car OP did. Now without OP how will she be able to buy nice expensive things. How selfish of OP.", "NTA I hate people like this. They expect everyone to help them out with the necessities but blow money on trivial things. No respect for a person who puts a boyfriend/girlfriend above their child.", "NTA\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about the child, you can set up a savings account for when they become an adult.", "NTA. Cousin is a grifter.  Maybe go low contact. Your decision to not give money makes a lot of sense.", "NTA. I can not stand people like this. It's disgusting. Can't afford your child because they're too worried about some man who is laying down with everyone. He's ginna be riding them chicks around too lol. You're cousin is goofy AF", "NTA", "NTA but your nephew may be getting neglected/ emotionally abused if he\u2019s constantly being told how much of an expense and burden he is.", "NTA \u2014 how ignorant does someone have to be to not realize how expensive it would be to raise a child? The fact that she had money to buy a car makes it obvious that she is playing upon your generous nature. Cut her off and never look back.", "NTA! \n\nAnd don\u2019t let her guilt trip you!! It\u2019s shit for the poor child, but your money will not make your cousin change her behavior", "NTA", "NTA why would you think you are TA here?  She's obviously taking advantage of you.", "Exactly this. If the mother prioritizes expenses for her ex over her child, then the child is the first one to suffer unfortunately. Without a family support system the poor kid might even become neglected (medically, nutrition-wise, schooling etc.) with serious consequences in his development. It\u2019s sad and downright infuriating whenever people do this, putting \u201cpartners\u201d above their children\u2019s needs. \n\nMaybe OP could speak with other family members and have some sort of \u201cintervention\u201d for the mother. Yeah the mother sounds like she\u2019s profiting off OPs kindness but in the end it\u2019s not a question of being an a-hole but of a child suffering the consequences.", "1.For your first question I\u2019m not quite sure why she\u2019s with him still but I have a feeling she\u2019s just with him to make her son\u2019s father jealous because the guy was his best friend up until she started dating him. \n2  She bought him a car because he crashed hers while on the way to see his side chick. Not only did she spend thousands buying him a car but thousands more buying herself another one. \n3. No idea where she got the money from but I found out that she used to have a wealthy boyfriend in the past who was wealthy and very generous with his money.", "Perfect solution.  \"Sorry, I'm broke...actually can you loan me some money?\"", "He\u2019s taken care of but she would often times ask me to buy those things for him so she would not have to herself because of the price.", "Nta, you would actually be crazy to continue supporting her.", "Nta. U helped buy the car. In the future, as I have learned, when someone asks for help paying for something offer to buy it or ask who to send the check to....sister had a nutty when I did this instead of just giving straight cash so she could go clothes shopping.", "NTA. And keep tabs on your nephew. Sounds like she's willing to put money towards stupid things instead of things he needs, like food, clothes etc.", "So she's a grifter who sees everyone around her as a walking wallet. Don't feel bad about cutting her off. If she complains or says anything about it, flat-out tell her it seems she has her hands in numerous wallets and she doesn't need yours too."]}
