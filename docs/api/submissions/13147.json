{"id": 13147, "submission_id": "121lib1", "title": "AITA for turning around and going home on my way to the airport for a girls trip?", "selftext": "I (23F) was supposed to go on a girls weekend trip to Spain with my long time friend of almost 10 years (24F) and her other female friend (28F) who I was excited to meet. We all live in Germany, but her and her friend live about 3.5 hours away from me and I live closer to Frankfurt. They decided that they wanted to drive through the night (about 10 hour) and arrive in the morning and said that if I could meet them in their town I could drive with them. I instead elected to just fly over and meet them there since I live so close to an airport.\n\nThe day before the trip she texts me a link to book some tickets to a museum that her and her friend booked. She told me to book for 2pm, which is when they booked for. When I clicked the link, the only time slot available was 8:35am. I pretty much was like whatever I will do something else while they are doing that.\n\nThe night before the trip I text her asking her how much I owed her for accommodations and whatever else that we are splitting. This is the second time I\u2019ve asked her since her friend was the one doing the bookings and I just assumed I would send them my share when they told me how much it cost. She didn\u2019t answer but I just assumed she was sleeping to prepare for the long drive. The morning of my flight (3 hours before my flight leaves) she tells me that I had to book my own hotel room because they\u2019re having a guy friend come with them that they invited last minute. She sent me a link so I could book at the same hotel as them for that night, but all the rooms were fully booked. I searched around the area too and all rooms were booked or very expensive.\n\nI really wanted to go so I just kind of let it go and prepared myself to spend some extra money for a hotel room for myself in a different hotel, but on the way to the airport I had a gut feeling that I wasn\u2019t going to enjoy myself. So I turned around and went home and sent her a text saying I was going to sit this one out because I was expecting a girls trip.\n\nShe\u2019s being short with me now and thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable.

And don't bother mentioning it to you until the day before.\n\nThey book a three person room... but don't bother to let you know what it's going to cost. And then don't bother to actually make it available to you either, because they're bringing a bloke along too.\n\nI totally agree - that's not a weekend you want to be a part of, they've made it abundantly clear they don't care about you.\n\nGood call in sitting it out.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nThey absolutely booked 3 tickets to the museum...they gave it to the guy, just as they gave your bed.\n\nYour friend is a shitty friend.", "NTA\nThey kicked you out of your hotel room on short notice, they are the ones to talk! Vollpfosten!", "NTA. You were just going to be a third wheel to your friend and her friend, who did not include you in museum bookings and then ditched you last minute to share a hotel room with a guy.  So you'd be in Spain trying to fit yourself in with whatever plans they make together?  Nope. You did the right thing.", " NTA. It really doesn\u2019t sound like she wanted you to come and you are probably right that it would have been a miserable trip.", "NTA.   Good for you for listening to your \"friend's\" actions and not her words.  There was nothing in those actions saying she wanted you to go on the trip.\n\nShe didn't book you a museum ticket when the other 2 tickets were bought and then last minute she gave away your spot to a guy friend, leaving you with no accommodation.\n\nWas she salty that you weren't going to share the driving so invited the guy to help with that?Driving 10 hours between two people isn't a big deal where I live but I know things are different in Europe where you pack a lunch for a 2 hour drive \ud83d\ude00.\n\nBut it doesn't matter anyway, she basically cut you out of the trip in a passive-aggressive manner and you made the right decision to listen to your gut.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It sounds like your friend and her other friend didn't communicate well with you about the trip details and last-minute changes, which is understandable why you felt uncomfortable about the situation. It's also understandable that you decided not to go on the trip if you had a gut feeling that you wouldn't enjoy it. It's better to take care of yourself and your mental well-being instead of forcing yourself into an uncomfortable situation.", "NTA. Your friend, on the other hand, really is an AH. You were an afterthought in everything she and/or her other friend planned. Time to look forward to adventures with new friends and keep this lukewarm one on the shelf.", "NTA ..what kind of friend is this ? She was booking things yet not including you ! I also think you would not have enjoyed that trip , the loss of a friend like this is not a loss .", "NTA, it sounds like this person is no longer a friend.", "NTA. This is super weird. You're like a spare tire on this trip. They're not planning with you or telling you what's going on at all. And now to bring some random guy too.

Not sure why they decided to ice you out but they did.  Good for you for catching on and saying, no thanks.", "Nta.

If I travel with someone then I would obviously ask them if they were interested in going to a museum and if yes then booking it for both. That was the first sign and everything done afterwards just makes it more clear.\n\nI would really reconsider your friendship - because it seems one-sided. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Good for you for reading the situation right and bailing.", "NTA! Although, i would be more clear why you\u2019re upset so they don\u2019t blame it on there being a man present. Their actions were pretty rude and letting them know that could help them understand they\u2019re in the wrong. They gave your spot up to a guy and iced you out of the plans. Thats messed up. If they just invited a dude and he had to find a different hotel, that\u2019d be different, but it\u2019s that they sold your spot to someone else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You will have a chance to spend this money better. Your friend also knew this when she wasnt answering your text the night before, she was just ashamed and didnt know how to act, because she knew it was wrong of her. \n\nHonestly I think they didnt even want you to go at all, I think they are friends, but not with you.", "NTA. Sounds like you were an afterthought to them and made the right choice for you.", "I'm sorry, but you need new friends. NTA obviously. But that's more than just bad planning. That's pure disrespect for you and you deserve much better. I'd limit my friendship with them to just texting or whatever occasionally and find new in-person hangout buddies", "NTA. Everyone else pretty much summed it up. I'm sorry you're dealing with this.", "NTA. Well done for not going! Don't go somewhere where you will not feel welcome and will feel uncomfortable. It will only result in bad memories", "NTA but she sure is.", "NTA They replaced you with the guy. They showed you that you aren't really welcome by not buying you a ticket and throwing you out of the planned hotel room to make place for someone else. I can see how this would go \"we have a dinner reservation for three- why don't you eat somewhere else\". \"Oh, here is just enough space for three, why don't you sit somewhere else\". And i can see them have the guy in the middle while walking, chatting with him happily, maybe even link arms and you walk behind them.\n\nWhy is she short with you when she clearly showed you, that the guy is more important for her? And to add another person especially a man to a girls trip, should be talked with everybody. To have someone unknown there, changes the dynamic - especially if you expect a girls trip!", "NTA they didn't pay for anything for you expected you would be able to get tickets and a hotel that  may be full or booked out.... do something for you and have fun... I'll  block her", "NTA it was supposed to be a girls trip and now they\u2019ve invited some guy and your supposed to be okay with it and they\u2019re booking hotels and tickets and booking for you too.

You did the right thing by not going.", "NTA - but you probably should have sorted out the logistics *before* you left for the trip, not as you were leaving.", "NTA. Your gut feeling was right. They would have treated you like an afterthought the whole weekend, since they had already given away your ticket and even your bed.", "   NTA. And that is not your best friend. They didn\u2019t include you in the museum, then excluded you from hotel accommodations. I\u2019m confused on why your friend is mad?
