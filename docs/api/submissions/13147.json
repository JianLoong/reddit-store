{"id": 13147, "submission_id": "121lib1", "title": "AITA for turning around and going home on my way to the airport for a girls trip?", "selftext": "I (23F) was supposed to go on a girls weekend trip to Spain with my long time friend of almost 10 years (24F) and her other female friend (28F) who I was excited to meet. We all live in Germany, but her and her friend live about 3.5 hours away from me and I live closer to Frankfurt. They decided that they wanted to drive through the night (about 10 hour) and arrive in the morning and said that if I could meet them in their town I could drive with them. I instead elected to just fly over and meet them there since I live so close to an airport.\n\nThe day before the trip she texts me a link to book some tickets to a museum that her and her friend booked. She told me to book for 2pm, which is when they booked for. When I clicked the link, the only time slot available was 8:35am. I pretty much was like whatever I will do something else while they are doing that.\n\nThe night before the trip I text her asking her how much I owed her for accommodations and whatever else that we are splitting. This is the second time I\u2019ve asked her since her friend was the one doing the bookings and I just assumed I would send them my share when they told me how much it cost. She didn\u2019t answer but I just assumed she was sleeping to prepare for the long drive. The morning of my flight (3 hours before my flight leaves) she tells me that I had to book my own hotel room because they\u2019re having a guy friend come with them that they invited last minute. She sent me a link so I could book at the same hotel as them for that night, but all the rooms were fully booked. I searched around the area too and all rooms were booked or very expensive.\n\nI really wanted to go so I just kind of let it go and prepared myself to spend some extra money for a hotel room for myself in a different hotel, but on the way to the airport I had a gut feeling that I wasn\u2019t going to enjoy myself. So I turned around and went home and sent her a text saying I was going to sit this one out because I was expecting a girls trip.\n\nShe\u2019s being short with me now and thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable.
