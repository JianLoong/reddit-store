{"id": 13147, "submission_id": "121lib1", "title": "AITA for turning around and going home on my way to the airport for a girls trip?", "selftext": "I (23F) was supposed to go on a girls weekend trip to Spain with my long time friend of almost 10 years (24F) and her other female friend (28F) who I was excited to meet. We all live in Germany, but her and her friend live about 3.5 hours away from me and I live closer to Frankfurt. They decided that they wanted to drive through the night (about 10 hour) and arrive in the morning and said that if I could meet them in their town I could drive with them. I instead elected to just fly over and meet them there since I live so close to an airport.\n\nThe day before the trip she texts me a link to book some tickets to a museum that her and her friend booked. She told me to book for 2pm, which is when they booked for. When I clicked the link, the only time slot available was 8:35am. I pretty much was like whatever I will do something else while they are doing that.\n\nThe night before the trip I text her asking her how much I owed her for accommodations and whatever else that we are splitting. This is the second time I\u2019ve asked her since her friend was the one doing the bookings and I just assumed I would send them my share when they told me how much it cost. She didn\u2019t answer but I just assumed she was sleeping to prepare for the long drive. The morning of my flight (3 hours before my flight leaves) she tells me that I had to book my own hotel room because they\u2019re having a guy friend come with them that they invited last minute. She sent me a link so I could book at the same hotel as them for that night, but all the rooms were fully booked. I searched around the area too and all rooms were booked or very expensive.\n\nI really wanted to go so I just kind of let it go and prepared myself to spend some extra money for a hotel room for myself in a different hotel, but on the way to the airport I had a gut feeling that I wasn\u2019t going to enjoy myself. So I turned around and went home and sent her a text saying I was going to sit this one out because I was expecting a girls trip.\n\nShe\u2019s being short with me now and thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable.

My bet is that one of these friends is interested in the guy and they replaced you in the hopes of hooking up with him, because if they really just wanted to add him to the trip they would have 1) asked you first, 2) had him book his own hotel or sleep on the floor or the 2 friends (24f/28f) could have shared a bed, 3) had him miss the museum since he was the late add on. These kind of friends are not truly your friends and it might be time to move on.

If this was done to me by a friend, I would cut off him or her immediately. Honesty is one of the most important things in a friendship.", "The hotel thing is sooo low that\u2019s unreal. Drop them", "NTA. Sounds like you were going on a vacation alone. They didn't book your tickets to the museum, they didn't book your hotel room. Sounds like 2 different vacations. You did the smart thing by going home. You would have been on your own the entire weekend. Now you know where you stand with this friend and you don't have to worry about how she feels about it.", "NTA\n\nThey didn\u2019t care either way if you were included. Their priorities were elsewhere.", "nta", "NTA it's not just that you were expecting a girls trip, they didn't include you or even think about you at any point while planning this.", "NTA you just need real friends.

She clearly didn\u2019t take you and the consideration much it off.", "NTA\n\nThey did book a third ticket for the museum and a hotel room too but it went to the guy friend\n\nInstead of apologising she's being short with you ?", "NTA", "Nope. Walk away from this person. Seems to me like you are the 3rd wheel, even 4th at this point. I would say if you are planning a \u201cgirls\u201d trip next time, just make it a duo, not a trio. Bringing a guy a long without telling you is horrible. Let alone have that guy take your spot in the room?! No way. Good choice on abandoning. This trip is not how you would have wanted it to be at all. Talk to your friend about all of this after it\u2019s over. Unfortunately it sort of sounds like you two are growing apart. It happens and doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s your fault. My suggestion is to not invest too much into this friendship anymore. If she wants to continue being friends, let her make the effort, not you. Keep some dignity.", "NTA, I also would have noped out of there. I don\u2019t understand why they wouldn\u2019t just buy your ticket and have you pay them back, and why they would randomly invite a guy along for a girls trip unless this was their plan all along. I\u2019m sorry OP, but those aren\u2019t friends and you deserve better.", "NTA, That is totally understandable. They weren\u2019t communicating nor planning for you, and it sounds like they gave your spot to some random dude last minute. Don\u2019t feel bad about this at all, just move forward with life.", "NTA. What a jerk just to not be upfront with you that you were uninvited. Block her...with friends like this who needs enemies?", "I dont think they cared whether you came or not and made it known hoping you'd just give up on the trip on your own and they wouldn't have to exclude you. NTA", "NTA\nLast minute they gave away your spot, and then they were mad you decided not to be an outsider on your own trip?", "NTA.

Who needs that? You did the right thing.", "NTA. You wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed yourself after they treated you like a second-class friend anyways. Recently something similar happened to my relative.

Good call on your part.", "NTA - sounds like the other female friend may be meddling and trying to exclude you. Some people are just like that. It\u2019s on your friend to call that out though.  I would have stayed home too.", "I think you did the right thing", "NTA", "NTA. What did she expect???

You did the right thing.", "NTA", "NTA, it sounds like they were alienating you.", "NTA. They never bothered trying to communicate with you any of the changes they made. They never asked if you wanted to go to the museum or booked tickets for you with them.

You agreed to a girls trip, not get a last minute room because of a guy trip", "NTA - Glad you listened to your gut.

We want this museum, are you ok with that? And to book three tickets. Then she gave your room up for some guy who she invited at the last minute and you were unable to get another room at the same hotel. Who does that to a friend let alone the night before the trip? She didn't want you there and she let you waste money on a plane ticket.\n\nYou deserve better friends and your gut that you wouldn't enjoy your trip was undoubtedly correct. NTA. And drop the \"friend.\"", "NTA. They changed plans at the last moment without consulting you.", "Not the asshole.\n\nIt sounds like she and her new friend were planning everything and simply letting you come along as a third wheel, at least after you declined to drive with them.

At this point she doesn't get to say that you did something wrong, she purposely changed the type of trip it was. It's just like if the guys were all booking a trip and somebody decides to bring their girlfriend... It throws the whole trip off and shouldn't happen unless everybody agrees.

Good riddance to bad things.", "NTA and those aren't your friends", "NTA.  You didn't say how the idea of this trip came about - was it always the three of you women?

Don't question your decision not to go. They actually made that decision for you. Good thing you went with your gut. Can you imagine how they would have treated you? What's she doing is projecting her guilt onto you. She knows she's the TA.", "Hell no, NTA. That's not how you run a girl's trip. Group chat, all decisions made together.

She may realize the problem of communication or not. I would not worry about it.", "NTA - she is not a very good friend. I suspect they did buy things in 3 (accommodation, museum, etc) and then invited the guy friend so you got unceremoniously bumped off.

I personally would, but that's because I feel like I had way too many friends walking over me and never making sure to include me or even being ok with excluding me because I never spoke up. I am still a big fan of being polite, so I would simply send a message explaining that what she did was not ok, it was hurtful and rude, and you wish she hadn't treated you as a third wheel in the trip, or even kicked you of the room you had agreed to share for some guy last minute.\n\nHowever, not saying anything and just distancing yourself wouldn't be wrong either.\n\nJust, please, don't carry on as if nothing had happened and she didn't do anything wrong.", "I'm really sorry that this is happening to you.

Friends are easily replaceable unless they live nearby/together or work. Ideally these people only care what 'value' you can bring into their lives and that's not difficult to hide while they do their barest minimum.\n\nIt's ok to mourn losing your friend, but in the long run you'll feel better not having to bend over backwards for people like her whose best is treating you like nothing more than a 3rd wheel or baggage when they invite you out. \n\nYou're NTA 1000x and your friend can guilt you for all she wants but her actions and decisions spoke for itself that you really don't have to explain yourself for because there are better people who will value you for who you are and respect your time and money.", "Sounds like she has a new friend who has become more important than you in her life.

She has no right to be mad at you. She should apologize if your friendship means anything to her.", "I said in another comment, but this feels like a friendship winding down; probably due to distance and lack of opportunity to feed it.

So many people before I thought were friends ended up being not even acquaintances, and I learned I really only have 3 actual friends. People suck and my wife is my best friend by far (which to be fair I've always felt that way).\n\nFun fact, i also know a few people's marriage that didn't even survive those 2 years since they never actually spent much time together until you both had to work from home and get to know how each other, rather than a couple hours a night during the week and maybe some times on the weekend.", "I don't think that is why you don't have friends.", "I don\u2019t know if it was as deep as that but I\u2019ve been in a similar situation with a friend. She had begun spending a lot of time with another friend of hers and several times we had plans it got altered where I got the shit end of the stick due to the other friend.
