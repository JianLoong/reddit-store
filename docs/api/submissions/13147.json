{"id": 13147, "submission_id": "121lib1", "title": "AITA for turning around and going home on my way to the airport for a girls trip?", "selftext": "I (23F) was supposed to go on a girls weekend trip to Spain with my long time friend of almost 10 years (24F) and her other female friend (28F) who I was excited to meet. We all live in Germany, but her and her friend live about 3.5 hours away from me and I live closer to Frankfurt. They decided that they wanted to drive through the night (about 10 hour) and arrive in the morning and said that if I could meet them in their town I could drive with them. I instead elected to just fly over and meet them there since I live so close to an airport.\n\nThe day before the trip she texts me a link to book some tickets to a museum that her and her friend booked. She told me to book for 2pm, which is when they booked for. When I clicked the link, the only time slot available was 8:35am. I pretty much was like whatever I will do something else while they are doing that.\n\nThe night before the trip I text her asking her how much I owed her for accommodations and whatever else that we are splitting. This is the second time I\u2019ve asked her since her friend was the one doing the bookings and I just assumed I would send them my share when they told me how much it cost. She didn\u2019t answer but I just assumed she was sleeping to prepare for the long drive. The morning of my flight (3 hours before my flight leaves) she tells me that I had to book my own hotel room because they\u2019re having a guy friend come with them that they invited last minute. She sent me a link so I could book at the same hotel as them for that night, but all the rooms were fully booked. I searched around the area too and all rooms were booked or very expensive.\n\nI really wanted to go so I just kind of let it go and prepared myself to spend some extra money for a hotel room for myself in a different hotel, but on the way to the airport I had a gut feeling that I wasn\u2019t going to enjoy myself. So I turned around and went home and sent her a text saying I was going to sit this one out because I was expecting a girls trip.\n\nShe\u2019s being short with me now and thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable.

But she is an AH and a shitty friend.", "NTA - I could be wrong, but I\u2019m guessing that they actually did book the museum ticket for you and the hotel room\u2026they just gave them away to the guy last minute. Which is just as bad, if not worse, because it probably means they knew you couldn\u2019t add a ticket/room for the same times and locations as them. My bet is that one of these friends is interested in the guy and they replaced you in the hopes of hooking up with him, because if they really just wanted to add him to the trip they would have 1) asked you first, 2) had him book his own hotel or sleep on the floor or the 2 friends (24f/28f) could have shared a bed, 3) had him miss the museum since he was the late add on. These kind of friends are not truly your friends and it might be time to move on. And if it was just thoughtlessness, then they should have apologized for making you feel unwelcome and asked how they could fix it, not gotten short with you and called you unreasonable. 20 somethings sometimes still act impulsively and thoughtlessly, but how they act when called out is what matters even more.", "NTA. She thinks you're being unreasonable??? Not sure the person who treats a friend of ten years like an after thought is in any position to make that judgement.", "NTA. If this was done to me by a friend, I would cut off him or her immediately. Honesty is one of the most important things in a friendship.", "The hotel thing is sooo low that\u2019s unreal. Drop them", "NTA. Sounds like you were going on a vacation alone. They didn't book your tickets to the museum, they didn't book your hotel room. Sounds like 2 different vacations. You did the smart thing by going home. You would have been on your own the entire weekend. Now you know where you stand with this friend and you don't have to worry about how she feels about it.", "NTA\n\nThey didn\u2019t care either way if you were included. Their priorities were elsewhere.", "nta", "NTA it's not just that you were expecting a girls trip, they didn't include you or even think about you at any point while planning this.", "NTA you just need real friends. Those two are unkind.", "NTA you are not the problem. She is. I sure you were very intuitive and very smart. She clearly didn\u2019t take you and the consideration much it off.", "NTA\n\nThey did book a third ticket for the museum and a hotel room too but it went to the guy friend\n\nInstead of apologising she's being short with you ?", "NTA", "Nope. Walk away from this person. Seems to me like you are the 3rd wheel, even 4th at this point. I would say if you are planning a \u201cgirls\u201d trip next time, just make it a duo, not a trio. Bringing a guy a long without telling you is horrible. Let alone have that guy take your spot in the room?! No way. Good choice on abandoning. This trip is not how you would have wanted it to be at all. Talk to your friend about all of this after it\u2019s over. Unfortunately it sort of sounds like you two are growing apart. It happens and doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s your fault. My suggestion is to not invest too much into this friendship anymore. If she wants to continue being friends, let her make the effort, not you. Keep some dignity.", "NTA, I also would have noped out of there. I don\u2019t understand why they wouldn\u2019t just buy your ticket and have you pay them back, and why they would randomly invite a guy along for a girls trip unless this was their plan all along. I\u2019m sorry OP, but those aren\u2019t friends and you deserve better.", "NTA, That is totally understandable. They weren\u2019t communicating nor planning for you, and it sounds like they gave your spot to some random dude last minute. Don\u2019t feel bad about this at all, just move forward with life.", "NTA. What a jerk just to not be upfront with you that you were uninvited. Block her...with friends like this who needs enemies?", "I dont think they cared whether you came or not and made it known hoping you'd just give up on the trip on your own and they wouldn't have to exclude you. NTA", "NTA\nLast minute they gave away your spot, and then they were mad you decided not to be an outsider on your own trip?", "NTA. This all sounds like you were being treated as an afterthought and not included in their plans but repeatedly told to make your own arrangements, last-minute, just so you could tag along. Who needs that? You did the right thing.", "NTA. You wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed yourself after they treated you like a second-class friend anyways. Recently something similar happened to my relative. She and her BFF planned to go to a particular country halfway around the world when it was safe to travel. That friend calls her up and says that she\u2019s leaving in a few days to that country, with a different friend. No remorse or anything.", "NTA I\u2019ve heard of so many bad experiences from women who took trips together so this was probably a sign that you shouldn\u2019t go.", "NTA.

I would have stayed home too.", "I think you did the right thing", "NTA", "NTA. What did she expect??? She totally screwed you over and basically shoved you out of a trip at the very last minute: of course you\u2019re going to think you won\u2019t enjoy it, and it\u2019s awesome you realized that before it was too late", "NTA and you\u2019re better off out of it.", "NTA, they were extremely inconsiderate of your feelings, didn\u2019t include you in the planning and then expected you to just be fine with it and pay extra money too. That\u2019s not friendship, that\u2019s just disrespectful and rude.", "NTA", "NTA, but saying you backed out because it was supposed to be a girls' trip puts the blame on the guy, while he might be the innocent party here \u2013 the shady one was your friend's friend. I feel sorry for your friend too, now she will be the third wheel on what seems to be a romantic trip.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t your friends.", "NTA. You were clearly not a part of their trip. You did the right thing.", "NTA", "NTA, it sounds like they were alienating you.", "NTA. They never bothered trying to communicate with you any of the changes they made. They never asked if you wanted to go to the museum or booked tickets for you with them.

Your \"friend\" and her friend are definitely AH here.", "They essentially blew you off. NTA and what terrible people.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t sound like a very good friend.

That just tells me she was really interested in just having the 3 of them on this trip. Sorry OP.

You agreed to a girls trip, not get a last minute room because of a guy trip", "NTA - Glad you listened to your gut. There's a certain amount of 'go-with-the-flow' needed when traveling in groups, but sounds like you enjoying the trip was not a priority for this group.", "NTA this friend didn't want you on this trip", "Not at all. NTA and I'm sorry you had to go through that \u2764", "Your \"friend\" is a complete asshole. \n\nShe didn't involve you in the plans to go out. How hard is it these days to communicate? We want this museum, are you ok with that? And to book three tickets. Then she gave your room up for some guy who she invited at the last minute and you were unable to get another room at the same hotel. Who does that to a friend let alone the night before the trip? She didn't want you there and she let you waste money on a plane ticket.\n\nYou deserve better friends and your gut that you wouldn't enjoy your trip was undoubtedly correct. NTA. And drop the \"friend.\"", "NTA. They changed plans at the last moment without consulting you.", "Not the asshole.\n\nIt sounds like she and her new friend were planning everything and simply letting you come along as a third wheel, at least after you declined to drive with them.

Did you not think she would be short with you?", "NTA, what they have set up now is not the trip you agreed to.", "NTA. This person does not sound like a nice person. They book a museum without you and do not book you a hotel room or even tell you in advance that you need to book for yourself. So heartbroken for you girl. \n\nYou made the right choice", "Always trust your gut feeling. NTA", "NTA. Always go with your gut.", "NTA. Ditch your friend.", "NTA.

At this point she doesn't get to say that you did something wrong, she purposely changed the type of trip it was. It's just like if the guys were all booking a trip and somebody decides to bring their girlfriend... It throws the whole trip off and shouldn't happen unless everybody agrees.

Good riddance to bad things.", "NTA and those aren't your friends", "NTA.  You didn't say how the idea of this trip came about - was it always the three of you women? Did you hear about it and ask to include yourself? It seems obvious that they cut you out somewhere along the way. Rich that's she's the one being short and calling you unreasonable. Don't question your decision not to go. They actually made that decision for you. Good thing you went with your gut. Can you imagine how they would have treated you? What's she doing is projecting her guilt onto you. She knows she's the TA.", "Hell no, NTA. That's not how you run a girl's trip. Group chat, all decisions made together.

Communication is key here especially when planning a trip. They should have been upfront with you on costs and also asked about the male friend since you were a part of the trip.

She may realize the problem of communication or not. I would not worry about it.", "NTA - she is not a very good friend. I suspect they did buy things in 3 (accommodation, museum, etc) and then invited the guy friend so you got unceremoniously bumped off. If you want to try and salvage the friendship, I would talk to her when she gets back and tell her how you felt and ask her what happened.

I personally would, but that's because I feel like I had way too many friends walking over me and never making sure to include me or even being ok with excluding me because I never spoke up. I am still a big fan of being polite, so I would simply send a message explaining that what she did was not ok, it was hurtful and rude, and you wish she hadn't treated you as a third wheel in the trip, or even kicked you of the room you had agreed to share for some guy last minute.\n\nHowever, not saying anything and just distancing yourself wouldn't be wrong either.\n\nJust, please, don't carry on as if nothing had happened and she didn't do anything wrong.", "I'm really sorry that this is happening to you.

Save your money, or go somewhere else you've been wanting to go, by yourself or with better friends.", "NTA She played you the entire time.", "NTA\n\nThese are absolutely NOT the kind of people you travel with, especially internationally. Your \"friend\" is not your friend. I'm glad you trusted yourself and didn't go.", "NTA and also not your friends, cut them off", "So they make all these arrangements excluding you on any of the decisions expecting you to book last minute.. what would have happened if you went with no where to stay etc.. sounds as if other 2 are more important to her than her friendship with you\u2026 \n\nI would have cancelled and stayed home as well\u2026 \n\nNTA", "NTA.  I think you were wise. There is a good chance you would not have enjoyed this trip with two strangers and people who messed up the plan and left it to you to fix.", "NTA and also you seem like a bit too patient with your friends.", "NTA, I would have sat that trip out too, sorry your friend was being like this.", "Your \"friend\" is a complete AH! You did the right thing.", "NTA.  Could she try any harder to completely exclude you?   Wow.  Why couldn\u2019t she buy your museum ticket?  Good thing you stayed home.  She doesn\u2019t sound like a long time friend at all.", "NTA - they've kicked you out of the trip and are now mad you decided yourself to not come..", "NTA\n\nBooking a museum and hotel, but it\u2019s sold out by the time they inform you. It\u2019s like you\u2019re just an afterthought to them. It\u2019s reasonable not to go because of their lack of communication.", "NTA.  Your 'Friend' is a huge AH.  She lied and then tried to manipulate. Just to be petty,  demand a refund for the money you already spent. \nSorry, she's the last childhood friend,  but now you've seen how she turned out.  Not particularly well.", "NTA", "I've read enough comments that I really don't have to say much.\n\nNTA.\n\nTime to get yourself some friends who actually ACT like friends...", "*She* and her friend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut no. NTA", "The room at the hotel was yours and they basically kicked you out for someone else. I think you need better friends. I would have done the same.  NTA", "NTA\n\nAlso, it is crazy how often this happens to people.  I didn\u2019t even know people did this kind of thing until I joined AITA!  I would never in a million years plan a trip with someone then suddenly invite other people who weren\u2019t part of the original plan. It\u2019s so unbelievably rude and thoughtless.", "Once they invited some guy it was no longer a \u201cgirls trip\u201d \n\nNTA", "NTA. They don't want you there.", "NTA. Good call. You thought about it and advocated for yourself.", "Inviting a guy on a girls trip defeats the whole point of going on a girls trip. Your friend and her friend ATA. I would not have gone either, and your friend is 100% in the wrong here.", "NTA for what you shared.\n\nBUT is there more to the story? I'm wondering if your friends got frustrated that they were fronting all the costs and that you were not pitching in on the driving and cost of gas. Maybe they invited the guy friend to help do the driving, pay for gas, and make sure he would pay for his share of the room that they had already booked because you were not seeing eye to eye with them on planning or proactively plannkng excursions and paying for them/hotels.", "Your friend never communicated with you what the plans were and also changed from original plan which was a girls trip\u2026 and invited a guy friend? \nyour friend should of expressed what the plan was long before, and decided to change pretty much everything last minute and book a room that did NOT include you? how rude. I wouldn\u2019t of gone either. NTA.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYour friend\u2019s behaviour is shitty, it\u2019s put you in an uncomfortable position and she should see that.", "NTA and you made the right choice. After the trip is over - give your friend a call and try genuinely asking her what happened. Once she has shared her side - paint the picture of your experience. Tell her what you told us and let her know that you really value her friendship and hope it will continue. She was definitely a jerk but it's also ok to forgive people for being jerks if they apologize and/or don't do it again.", "NTA, Fake Friend", "NTA. This is a classic case of, you were basically disinvited. I mean, who plans a group trip and doesn\u2019t get enough tickets or book a room for all? I mean, yeah, the dude replaced you but I think it\u2019s more than that. I mean what kind of trip is this if you\u2019re in a different hotel and can\u2019t go with them to certain events? You are very correct, you\u2019d have had a terrible time being ignored the whole trip. \n\nI\u2019d have an in person heart to heart with your friend after she gets back. Because her other friend intentionally excluded you.", "Wow, your friend sucks. NTA. The trip wasn\u2019t what you were previously led to expect and you were being treated as an afterthought. They clearly DGaF about you.", "NTA - sounds like your friend let the other friend gain too much control and it turned into their trip... she may now feel like a third on a trip that was for you so maybe shes not mad but disappointex (due to her own actions) if this is a friendship worth saving i would ask if you 2 could reschedule a GIRLS trip.", "I suspect they DID book the 3rd ticket for her but chose to give it to the male friend joining them as they did with her hotel room.", "x2.", "Agreed. Nothing to do with him.", "Would it be malicious of me to hope that the guy turns out to be someone the 28F has been wanting to spend time with for a while, and your friend ends up feeling like a really awkward third wheel? Yeah? I'd better not say that then.\n\nSeriously though - it absolutely sucks that you've had a fun weekend to catch up with a friend to look forward to, and the rug's been pulled out like this. At least you found out in advance.\n\nReally hope you can find other fun things to do this weekend!", "NTA. She is not your friend she is merely an acquaintance that you have known for a very long time and hopefully soon to be a former acquaintance.  You would have felt like a third wheel on that trip and that is exactly how they treated you prior to you getting there.  Lose them, block them, she showed you who she really is-believe her.", "Yeah you had 3 or 4 unpleasant surprises that show their complete lack of consideration for you, and that's before the trip even started. There would definitely be more if you went. I think you made the right call and maybe should seriously consider whether this friendship is worth continuing.", "I mean she either did it on purpose or you became an afterthought... Either way not a good friend.", "Good for you that you trusted your gut. You would've been uncomfortable throughout the whole trip and felt angry at yourself for not trusting your instincts.", "And OP don\u2019t state the reason only thinking it was a girls trip. This was poorly planned and they were very inconsiderate throughout the planning. \n\nPersonally a similar thing happened to me, but I wasn\u2019t in a position to just turn around so I spaced myself from them during the trip. I even blew up on them on the last day. Needless to say, one was*** my bestie of 14 years (I was even her MOH). We don\u2019t talk anymore. Lol. You may have saved your friendship by not going lol.", "That's not a friend.", "Perhaps a it\u2019s the other friend guiding her actions. One of my very best friends from high school once invited her other friend (that I hadn\u2019t met before) to me birthday party. It was going to be a small dinner at a place my husband and I enjoyed. Then we were going to go to this area that you could walk, shop, and pop into bars. They were downers the entire time. Then they decided to go to a bar I knew I wouldn\u2019t enjoy so hubs and I just stood outside impatiently until they got the hint to leave. My friend is normally not like this but when she had the other friend around her actions changed. This was just one time of a few I saw her like this.", "Is this even a friend you want to be part of? This woman sounds rude and self obsessed.", "Speaking from experience, just because you've known your friend longer (assuming) than her other friend, doesn't mean that she sees you the same way as you have despite the distance and decades you've known each other. \n\nI've had met and befriended people like her and the best way I could describe her is like a goldfish with her friendship-span, meaning she only sees whoever is the closest to her physically as her best friend. Friends are easily replaceable unless they live nearby/together or work. Ideally these people only care what 'value' you can bring into their lives and that's not difficult to hide while they do their barest minimum.\n\nIt's ok to mourn losing your friend, but in the long run you'll feel better not having to bend over backwards for people like her whose best is treating you like nothing more than a 3rd wheel or baggage when they invite you out. \n\nYou're NTA 1000x and your friend can guilt you for all she wants but her actions and decisions spoke for itself that you really don't have to explain yourself for because there are better people who will value you for who you are and respect your time and money.", "Sounds like she has a new friend who has become more important than you in her life. Could be friend invited male friend, and your friend didn't stand up for you and your needs. Sad and frustrating, but I imagine being on the trip would have been even worse, with your input ignored or shut down. NTA.", "Yeah, things do line up very plausibly that way, don't they?", "This is the answer!", "Driving 10 he's where I live is barely a state and a half lol.", "A \u2018recovering people pleaser\u2019, I definitely relate to that. It is so difficult to say \u2018enough it\u2019s enough\u2019. You were very brave and I\u2019m so happy you put yourself first in this situation!", "'Not sure if that will end our friendship but if it does then it\u2019s probably better that way.'\n\nThat's the spirit. \nYour friend must recognize that you probably won't be able to book a room in the same place as her. She has no right to be mad at you. She should apologize if your friendship means anything to her.", "I said in another comment, but this feels like a friendship winding down; probably due to distance and lack of opportunity to feed it. Them inviting someone last minute and essentially giving him your slot says volumes about what your friend thinks of you.", "It's kind of sad, but if there's anything 2 years of lockdown or partial lockdowns in Canada taught me,  my actual friend circle has shrunk considerably. So many people before I thought were friends ended up being not even acquaintances, and I learned I really only have 3 actual friends. People suck and my wife is my best friend by far (which to be fair I've always felt that way).\n\nFun fact, i also know a few people's marriage that didn't even survive those 2 years since they never actually spent much time together until you both had to work from home and get to know how each other, rather than a couple hours a night during the week and maybe some times on the weekend.", "I don't think that is why you don't have friends.", "I don\u2019t know if it was as deep as that but I\u2019ve been in a similar situation with a friend. She had begun spending a lot of time with another friend of hers and several times we had plans it got altered where I got the shit end of the stick due to the other friend. My friend may or may not have been aware of how she was acting due to the third person. I just try not to associate with the third person now.", "I've always assumed the original literal meaning is a full hit on the goalpost, i.e. definitely _not_ scoring a goal. As opposed to scoring via a near miss, a glancing hit on the post that goes in. (Dunno if that's called a \u201eHalbpfosten\u201c \u2013 \u201chalf post\u201d \u2013 in German, but it might be.)", "No, it's not your responsibility to make your travel far less inconvenient just to make theirs a bit *more* convenient. Why should you have to drive 3.5 hours to their home just to be an extra driver for them? If it's that important to them to have you in the car, they should make the 3.5 hour trip *to you.* And if it isn't worth an extra 3.5 hr drive to them, then they should understand why it isn't for you, either. If they wanted to travel together, they could have driven to *your town* and you could have all flown together. If not, then they should've just been perfectly happy to travel separately. \n\nI'd much rather take a 100euro flight than drive 3.5 hrs just to turn around and drive all night just for a weekend getaway. \n\nI think if you \"knew it would cost you the whole trip\" then you should have reflected on *why* simply making convenient travel arrangements for yourself would \"cost you the trip\", real friends would want your travel experience to be pleasant and would still love to spend the weekend with you.", "The way this comment is cut short makes me worried that the people in black clothes and ski masks came to carry you off", "I actually made more friends online than I ever had growing up during Covid. the fact that someone bullied me on this comment made my point. Most people suck and it\u2019s ok to be picky and choose who you want in your life most people fake care. Especially family. I think 3 good friends is better than 20 fake ones.", "Travel is one of the best measures of compatibility. You stay in the same room, see their habits & see how they deal with adversity.", "Sorry you had better experiences? Lol like why are you sorry for me? Many people have had experiences like mine. Well not like me at all none of you have. But the people I have met including family have been horrible backstabbing lying people. That doesn\u2019t mean that I missed out on experiences. It means I seen the truth in most people. Sorry you haven\u2019t experienced the true nature of that type person. All you have to do is open the internet or this subreddit to see people\u2019s true nature. Most people I know grew up lonely, bullied, abused. Fake friends all around. Fake people who only care about themselves. You don\u2019t need to feel sorry because you have friends and I don\u2019t. I\u2019m actually happy I have a small friend circle. Less people complaining and not using or abusing me.", "Life hasnt beaten me down. I have just seen the true nature of many people. What happened to OP I have heard and experienced similar things. You give your honest opinion and I can give mine. If you experienced great friend groups I\u2019m happy for you but that\u2019s not the case for most people. Go online and see how lonely people are\u2026. So I can say that most people are crap. Seems to be most people don\u2019t have the magical friend groups. Most of us are bullied and lonely. and no I\u2019m not saying I am. I\u2019m just telling you the other side of the beautiful amazing friend groups lol", "No your right. I don\u2019t have friends because I like to avoid people like you. makes for a better life to not have AHs in it. \u270c\ud83c\udffb", "Geburtstagskuchen!", "That and camping lol.", "Yeah, I'm sorry, you haven't had that experience. I'm sorry for everyone who hasn't had that experience. True friends who will always have your back, who are great and kind company at the same time, is one of the best things ever. I think it makes my life much richer to know people like that.\n\nI do believe it's quality and not quantity,  that matters, so if you have a small friend circle, who are good people, haven't you experienced, what I'm talking about? Or are they just less backstappy than the rest of them? Pardon the personal question,  but I'm genuinely curious!"]}
