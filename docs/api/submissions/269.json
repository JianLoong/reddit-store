But you're allowed to be upset, especially since your gf should know this about you and she disregarded it.

I obviously am assuming but I feel like if the roles were reversed your gf would be pretty upset, too, if she was in your position.", "ESH. It sounds like you\u2019re militantly weird about Halloween and it\u2019s so important to you that it makes you upset if it\u2019s not \u201cperfect\u201d.
