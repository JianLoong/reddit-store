My stepdad, classic white guy who loves his oven chips and thinks salt is spicy, is the one who does the food shopping but he never gets anything for me to eat\n\nSince there\u2019s no food for me at home, I had to skip meals and the only thing I ever had were things like instant ramen. Every time he would see me eat he\u2019d say \u2018all you can do is boil some water\u2019. If I ever bought my own food so I could eat at home, he always eats it before Ive even had any. If my mum ever brought me leftovers (she was never home), he\u2019d say \u2018you\u2019re eating that spicy shit again? Ugh that\u2019s disgusting\u2019. I put up with this for years, him constantly slandering any foreign food I ate. \n\nLast week, he asked if I wanted to get a takeaway. There\u2019s this one place I really like the sushi from and he asked if I wanted to get something from there, I said yes and he started looking through his options. He turned and said to me \u2018what sushi do you even get from there?\u2019 Before I even replied he started reading out the description. \n\n\u201810 piece sushi roll with wasabi, ew, soy sauce, ugh, and pickled ginger. How can you even eat this crap?\u2019\n\nThen he starts scrolling through each of the rolls they had. \n\n\u2018Sea bass, ugh, raw tuna!? Ew.\u2019 etc and he pulled a face as he read each one out. \n\nAt this point I was getting pretty sick of his constant comments on food he personally doesn\u2019t eat.\n\nM: why do you feel the need to pull a face at everything that isn\u2019t English?\n\nSD: what did you just say? I\u2019m not pulling a face, I just can\u2019t stand the shit. \n\nM: you don\u2019t have to be so rude about it though, I don\u2019t like how you comment on the foods I like, especially when they\u2019re foreign. \n\nSD: why do you even care so much? it\u2019s just my opinion. I just don\u2019t like their food. \n\nM: I understand that but you don\u2019t have to be so disrespectful, it can be seen as quite offensive too. \n\nHere he starts raising his voice, something he\u2019s never done before. \n\nSD: you and this generation, always getting offended at everything, you know what, i was having a conversation about this with a chick today.\n\nNow I admit this is a bit weird but, sometimes I talk like a chav when I\u2019m angry because I find it funny and it makes me laugh. So I said..\n\nM: wut you getting pressed for mayte? \n\nAnd oh my god he exploded \n\nSD: IM NOT GETTING PRESSED IT JUST DOES MY FUCKING TITS IN\n\nI decided here to take a quick second and change back to talking calmly\n\nM: so you\u2019re not getting pressed but it\u2019s doing your tits in?\n\nSD: YOU KNOW WHAT, GO GET YOUR OWN  FUCKING FOOD, PISS OFF\n\nSo I did, I went for a walk in the pitch black and came back an hour later. I didn\u2019t end up eating.\n\nI told my boyfriend about it, he said I was wrong to bring it up like that and I\u2019m an asshole.\n\nIt\u2019s been a week since then and my stepdad and I haven\u2019t said a single word to each other, he refuses to even look at me. I\u2019m starting to feel kind of guilty and like it\u2019s my fault I escalated it at the wrong time.", "created_utc": 1668092729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrhp68/aita_for_getting_annoyed_at_my_stepdads_constant/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had an attitude and instead of talking with him about it in a calm moment you escalated the situation. Also does he not bring you any food or just not the ones you prefer? If it is just not your offered taste than you are the AH for being a picky eater. \nAns of course he is an AH as well. He can dislike something but doesnt need to vocalize it. He sounds very immature. So overall both very childish.", "NTA.  But your stepdad is.

I'm not saying he's in the right by any means but don't try pulling that shit. My kids say it all the time to make me look like shit.
