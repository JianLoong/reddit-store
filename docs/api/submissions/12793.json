I advised her to switch to another company or learn full stack as there are many jobs in that, but she made it sound like it was beneath her. Full stack is not beneath her or easy, it is just that more people do it because there are more jobs and they pay decent.\n\nShe recently just got layed off and told me, I guess hearing about FaAnG and how what she does is so specialized and only done by top engineers and how she has a masters got to me and I laughed and said something like how do you like FAANG now?\n\nShe got angry at me and called me an AH. The thing is it is not like she is in a bad situation, she got an excellent severance package and has more than enough time to depend on that and her savings to find another job, so I don't feel it is like she got layed of without severance or something.

Try harder than that because I read the story too and u literally just repeated it to me in offence. That\u2019s it.", "Largely I agree, except with your use of the word historical.\n\nThey are attempting to reverse very current discrimination. The current discrimination which has it's foundations in historical discrimination. \n\nDon't look to individual examples to validate your point of view.\n\nIn every generalised study, women have it harder than men. Go check out www.unwomen.org/en for some really good starter sources if you're interested in learning more.\n\nIt's really positive that you're questioning whether or not you were an asshole. That's the first step in becoming an ally.\n\nProud of you.", "So, you're jealous of her. You don't have a \"real\" CS degree, while she has an undergrad and a masters.\n\nFrankly, your super problematic views and bitter attitude are going to neuter your career progression.", "Sure you did, lol", "Yta", "\u201cIt\u2019s easier for minorities\u201d is also racism, FYI.", "I'll grant you that.", "On the whole I agree, things do differ betweek countries and even regions between countries. For the industry as a whole, there is a big imbalance.\n\nThese days it is better at the popular companies sometimes since they get so many candidates they can easily hire the best women and have first pick of talent. I do agree that there is current discrimination as well, a lot of the older employees who did and do the discriminating still work her, I have seen women and minorities not get promoted over other people when they deserved it.", "U really tried something there. Like u really thought he\u2019d default to sexism and he still got downvoted when he clearly didn\u2019t proved the bait wrong. I just find that funny.", "I am not jealous of her. I just have different aspirations than her. I have already progressed as a full stack dev and wish to remain one and already make decent money.", "these companies also hire the best men. they have such a large candidacy pool, it's basically ensured. the issue here is you are not the best.", "Ok.", "If they have 10 spots, 3 qualified women applicants, and 20 qualified men, it is highly likely all the women will get the job if the company has a target of trying to hire 30% women. Even my gf would agree to this.", "If there are 3 qualified women, and 20 qualified men, it speaks to issues that women have to overcome in order to be qualified.", "If all 3 women were qualified, why shouldn\u2019t they get the spot? If there are only 10 spots and 23 *qualified* applicants, there are going to be 13 that don\u2019t get offered a position. Why does it bother you that 3 qualified women would get hired over 3 qualified men? And that is without the consideration that there\u2019s almost always tie breakers. Even if they are subjective. \u201cCandidate A seems to fit better with our team\u201d could be just as valid a reason to hire candidate A over candidate b as \u201ccandidate A is a woman\u201d.", "would those 7 men not be the best men out of the 20 men? \n\nyou should be focusing on honing your skill set so you are 1 of those 7 men.", "If they are all qualified, then what is your point?", "I\u2019m sorry but no. You\u2019re talking about companies that employ literally tens of thousands of software engineers. It is insane to think reaching some sort of quota is the most powerful force driving the hiring process or that it\u2019s at the forefront of everyone\u2019s mind while they are making these decisions.", "Your girlfriend isn't the final authority", "LOL the gymnastics.", "For what I do, there are plenty of equivalent jobs outside of large places like Google, so I do not need to bother and I think I would like smaller companies anyway. I am not obsessed with being the best. And sometimes it comes down to random luck, and whether the interviewer likes your character or face more if there are multiple qualified applicants.", "Not for the whole industry, but I am sure she knows about the hiring decisions she and her team made."]}
