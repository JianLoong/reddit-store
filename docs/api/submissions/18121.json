He's the best dog in the world. He's thirteen. He's on his last leg, and the vet told me at this point I'm being unfair to Demon by not letting him have peace. We scheduled the appointment for the week after next, which is my custody week.\n\nWhen my ex-wife came to pick up our son, he didn't want to leave because he wanted an extra week to spend time with Demon and say goodbye. She said that he would be able to spend time with Demon when he came back next week, but that would only be for a couple of days, and then Demon will be gone. He teared up and then went to go hug Demon goodbye. I tried to negotiate with her, but she said she didn't want to hear it. That's when the feeling of contempt came over me and I called her a cold-hearted bitch. She stared at me in disbelief and asked me what I just said.\n\nI never talk that way to any woman, and I especially never spoke that way to her. I've always tried to keep things cordial between us. I should have taken it back, but I kept going. I told her the reason no man will ever stay with her is no one can love someone with a frozen stone heart. She stared at me like she'd never seen me before and then turned around and walked away.\n\nWhen my son came out I said his mom changed her mind. He texted her to thank her. I have no clue if she responded. I'm so ashamed of what I said. I told my wife, and she was shocked I said that and said it will probably make things harder in the future but maybe it was worth it so my son can have an extra week with Demon.\n\nI feel sick inside. I know my mother would be so ashamed of me. Yet, deep down I know if I could undo it I wouldn't. My son and Demon are sleeping together in his room right now.

And regardless of that, you're the asshole for trying to spring a custody change on her. Your final paragraph shows the truth. You prioritized YOUR grief.

You blew it way out of proportion and we're frankly just using this as an excuse to say some stuff to hurt her, since it wasn't relevant to the point in hand at all.

Your son asked, was told no and he was sad but accepted it.\n\nIt also sounds like you alternate weeks. She was there to pick him up after he spent the week with you, I assume? So what you basically asked her was to not have her son at her place for three weeks in a row (he spent the week with you, you wanted her week also and then the week after that was again your week). I guess she likes her own kid so it's understandable she didn't enjoy the perspective of not seeing him for the next two weeks, too. So, not immediately saying yes doesn't mean she doesn't care about her son's feelings. \n\nShe also just drove to you. I don't know the distance between your homes, but it is at least annoying to find out you just drove around without any need. That also makes her reaction understandable.\n\nAnd instead of working on a compromise you just started to be extremely mean and hurtful.\n\nI understand your grief. I dread the day I will have to let one of my dogs go. But you still think you were somehow justified. It seems you don't like your ex and assume the worst of her very easily. \n\nAnd that makes you the asshole. You should feel ashamed.

Your grief doesn't mean you get to crap  on someone. I hope she refuses your so called apology.", "YTA.\n\nAll this should have been a discussion between you and your ex wife long before she came to pick up your son. You should not have sprung this on her, and thrown in an upset child into the mix just to get your way. YTA for that.\n\nCustody arrangements are there for a reason - so that neither parent overtakes their time with the child to the detriment of the other parent. Your ex wife does not have to apologise for taking her child back when it\u2019s time. She - and you - are in a situation where your  child WILL miss major events at both households, and it\u2019s your responsibility to work around that. YTA for expecting otherwise. \n\nFinally, verbally abusing your ex wife ? Within earshot of your child ? Oh yes, YTA. *Lying* to your child that his mother has changed her mind when you pretty much forced her out the door with your horrible words ? YTA, YTA.

You verbally abused her, manipulated her into getting your way, played your son against her, and now you're playing the victim to try to solicit validation for your behavior Depending on your custody arrangements, this incident could come back to bite you in the ass, as well. There was absolutely nothing unreasonable in her wanting to take her son home with her during her time with him, and there was nothing unreasonable about her telling her son that he can spend time with your dog when he returns. It's sad your dog is dying, but you and your son both have to accept the fact that he can't spend all the time he wants with the dog, regardless. Are you going to keep him out of school until it's time for the dog to be put down?   If your son having more time with the dog is important to you, then you could've booked a different date.

That\u2019s made all the more critical because a child is involved. \n\nTo handle this respectfully and ethically would have required a lot of prep on your end (therapy or some outlet to help with emotional regulation,, open communication in advance, and a bargained for exchange), etc. \n\nFor example, a responsible parent would have contacted the ex, explained, arranged for the child to stay for two full weeks in exchange the child would stay two consecutive weeks with the other parent, or get a major holiday, something.
