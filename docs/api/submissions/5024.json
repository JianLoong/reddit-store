I\u2019m gonna call him Luke. My mom does not like Luke or my dad or Luke\u2019s mom. I\u2019m not close to any of them either. I despise my step mother and I hated my dad for a long time too but our relationship has improved. I barely have a relationship with Luke but that\u2019s improving too.\n\nOne thing my mom believes in is karma. Or at least her definition of it. Ever since the day she found out my dad cheated, she\u2019s been telling me about how karma will get him and the other woman back disguised as Luke. \n\nSomething happened to Luke a couple years ago, my mom called it karma. This was disgusting to me. While I usually just let my mom say whatever because she\u2019s been through a lot, I draw the line at her calling my half brother\u2019s trauma karma. \n\nInstead of just minding her own business, my mom told everyone and their moms about how this was karma getting them back. We had a massive fight about it and didn\u2019t talk for months but she eventually apologized. \n\nI\u2018ve been spending some time with Luke because my dad said he\u2019s been feeling a bit down since he broke up with his girlfriend and I wanted to catch up. My mom doesn\u2019t like it but keeps her mouth shut.\n\nAnyways, I was staying the night at my mom\u2019s house for reasons and was FaceTiming my husband in my room. I told him how Luke\u2019s actually a really fun kid to be around and that I\u2019m very glad he\u2019s been able to rise above everything that\u2019s happened to him. I then said: \u201che\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d \n\nThe second I said that I heard a sound outside my door, hung up then found my mom listening. I asked her wtf she was doing and she immediately said \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t care this much, hate to say it but this is just karma at work. I doubt this is the last struggle he\u2019ll have to deal with. Karma\u2019s unforgiving like that.\u201d \n\nI was honestly mostly really disappointed. I ended up yelling though and told her to stfu about her stupid fucking karma and move on. It\u2019s been 17 years. She sounds insane. \n\nMy mom was all like \u201cHow could you say that? You know what I\u2019ve had to deal with! Are you betraying me too?!\u201d\n\nI just rolled my eyes at her and walked into my room. She began to yell at me through the door saying I broke her heart and how I\u2019m being incredibly cruel etc. She didn\u2019t talk to me the next morning and looked as if she cried all night. My older sister says that I should apologize and that I should be kinder but idk... AITA here?\n\nEdit: \n\nI\u2019m 30 years old. My dad and mom are both the same age and 50+.

I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sorry for your mother, and it\u2019s your dads fault for cheating, but maybe you should urge her to get therapy or something.", "Hard NTA. Let's pretend karma is a thing. Saying that this kid deserves to be punished for the actions of his parents is fucked up. Futhermore, her belief in karma is clearly a manifestation of her own twisted vendetta.", "NTA - Moms needs therapy.", "NTA.

You could phrase it in better way but your mother here is a mature adult who needs to get her act together.", "Your mother needs serious therapy. She is legitimately obsessed with her ex-husband.

Your cheating dad getting cheated on IS karma, and your mom is justified to enjoy that. But enjoying a young kid's trauma, essentially saying he deserves it because of the sins of his parents, is extremely disgusting, especially considering this kid is her child's sibling. She has no right to comment on his trauma at all and you're right to tell her to shut up. Hope Luke is doing okay.", "Definitely NTA, this kid is innocent.

Phew, must be a long list.\n\nLuke is/was just a kid and has nothing to do with his dad cheating etc. He's pretty much innocent and your mother let's all her frustration and Anger out on him and you.

There are terrible people out there living it up with no real problems. Some of the best-hearted people are subjected to horrific circumstances sometimes.\n\nYour mother is cruel. Next time something bad happens to her, say that it\u2019s karma for using her nasty mindset as a healing process.", "It sounds like you were upset and frustrated with your mom's behavior and expressed your feelings strongly. It's understandable that you would be disappointed and angry if you feel like your mom is behaving in a way that is hurtful or inappropriate, especially if you feel like she is making negative comments about your half-brother. However, it's also important to consider how your words and actions may affect your relationship with your mom and try to find ways to communicate effectively with her.\r  \n\r  \nIn this situation, it might be helpful to try to explain to your mom why her comments about your half-brother and karma are hurtful to you. You could let her know that you care about Luke and that it's not fair or helpful to attribute his struggles to some sort of cosmic punishment. You could also try to express your feelings about your mom's behavior and the impact it has on you and your relationship with her.\r  \n\r  \nIt's also important to remember that your mom has been through a lot and may be dealing with her own pain and emotions related to the situation with your dad. It might be helpful to try to be understanding and supportive of her, even if you disagree with her perspective or behavior.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, the decision to apologize or not is up to you. It's important to consider whether an apology would be genuine and whether it would help to improve your relationship with your mom.
