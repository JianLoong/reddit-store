I despise my step mother and I hated my dad for a long time too but our relationship has improved. I barely have a relationship with Luke but that\u2019s improving too.\n\nOne thing my mom believes in is karma. Or at least her definition of it. Ever since the day she found out my dad cheated, she\u2019s been telling me about how karma will get him and the other woman back disguised as Luke. \n\nSomething happened to Luke a couple years ago, my mom called it karma. This was disgusting to me.

We had a massive fight about it and didn\u2019t talk for months but she eventually apologized. \n\nI\u2018ve been spending some time with Luke because my dad said he\u2019s been feeling a bit down since he broke up with his girlfriend and I wanted to catch up. My mom doesn\u2019t like it but keeps her mouth shut.\n\nAnyways, I was staying the night at my mom\u2019s house for reasons and was FaceTiming my husband in my room. I told him how Luke\u2019s actually a really fun kid to be around and that I\u2019m very glad he\u2019s been able to rise above everything that\u2019s happened to him. I then said: \u201che\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d \n\nThe second I said that I heard a sound outside my door, hung up then found my mom listening. I asked her wtf she was doing and she immediately said \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t care this much, hate to say it but this is just karma at work. I doubt this is the last struggle he\u2019ll have to deal with. Karma\u2019s unforgiving like that.\u201d \n\nI was honestly mostly really disappointed. I ended up yelling though and told her to stfu about her stupid fucking karma and move on. It\u2019s been 17 years. She sounds insane. \n\nMy mom was all like \u201cHow could you say that? You know what I\u2019ve had to deal with! Are you betraying me too?!\u201d\n\nI just rolled my eyes at her and walked into my room. She began to yell at me through the door saying I broke her heart and how I\u2019m being incredibly cruel etc. She didn\u2019t talk to me the next morning and looked as if she cried all night. My older sister says that I should apologize and that I should be kinder but idk... AITA here?\n\nEdit: \n\nI\u2019m 30 years old. My dad and mom are both the same age and 50+.
