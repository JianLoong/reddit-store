{"id": 30918, "submission_id": "17uhupr", "title": "AITA for selling my late grandparents' ranch even though they asked me not to?", "selftext": "Long story short, my grandparents used to live on this ranch for almost 60 years and both passed on the property. My mother was raised there and so were my siblings and I so there's quite a lot of sentimental value to the house. There's also a lot of monetary value to the property. The problem is the upkeep. Especially as a single 28 year old with a moderate pay job. Which is what I told my grandfather years ago when he told me wanted the house to be my inheritance to raise my own family like he did his. It became a running thing with him telling me I needed to get comfortable with the house for when it's mine, me saying I'd just sell it and him arguing with me about that.\n\nHe sadly passed early last year quite suddenly and true to his word, left the house to me amongst other assets. I decided I'd try make the old man happy and accepted the responsibility. For the past year I've been trying to make everything work with fluctuating success but ultimately, the house is somewhat of a sinkhole. On top of that, I've been headhunted for a job across the country with potential to move overseas within the next year. After long internal deliberations I decided to just sell the house. When I told my sister, she lost her shit. She says I'm disrespecting the old man's wishes by selling it to a stranger and should rather let her and her husband have it. I told her she could have it immediately, as long as she could pay the market value for the house. She thinks it's unfair to ask for money for a house I got for free and offered to stay in it and in return she'll upkeep it herself. I was planning on using the money from the sale for a place when I move though so that also wouldn't work out. There's a lot of tension now and she's even trying to rally family members against me.\n\nI get the old man wouldn't be happy with this if he were alive, but frankly, and lovingly, he isn't and I shouldn't burden myself right? Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1699901863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17uhupr/aita_for_selling_my_late_grandparents_ranch_even/", "score": 1689, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe keep the house in your name as a \"home of last resort\" for whoever in your family needs it at the time in exchange for upkeep with the understanding (and legal documents drafted by a real estate attorney to back it up) that it's still yours for your retirement and will stay in the family in perpetuity when you're gone? Maybe put it in a  trust to that effect? That seems like a possible way to still honor your grandfather's spoken will (which your sister can and probably will use to contest the sale in court) while still reducing upkeep and extracting the cash you need to get set up in your new location; my maternal relatives have a similar setup for a farmhouse my great-great-grandfather built, with all but a few acres having been sold off to a neighbor years ago to fund my great-grandmother's retirement.", "INFO: Market value is a really shitty barometer for a family property like this. Could you make a start for the tax-assessed value of the property? You won't make a killing, but it would be a damn sight more than if you inherited nothing while keeping the property in the family. And if your sister can't come up with the tax assessed value as a mortgage, she wouldn't be able to pull the upkeep anyhow.", "NTA. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of venerating the wishes of the dead when it\u2019s counter to your own well-being. I think it\u2019s nice that you tried but your grandpa was under no illusions about your feelings on keeping the ranch in the family\n\nDefinitely check for hidden treasure, cursed gold or buried bodies before you sell\n\nEdited to say that with the added context from OP, I think selling it to sister \u201cfor fair market value\u201d is shitty. Sure, she should pay something, at least to recoup your cost from maintaining it (assuming that also didn\u2019t come from your disproportionate inheritance), but you\u2019re drifting into asshole territory for me", "If you sell, the family will likely never get it back. If anyone in the family had any desire to keep it, I'd work out a way to make that happen.\n\n\nIt's in your name and you are probably free and clear to sell it without anyone's opinion making a difference.\n\n\nThe only downside is people will think YTA.", "Based on your replies, YTA. \n\nYes, honoring the wishes of the dead really should only reach so far, but multiple comments have made very reasonable alternative suggestions, and you seem not to have put any real thought into them at all. A house that has been in the family for generations, an unfair inheritance, and you don't even care enough to consider any options short of selling right now at market value.\n\nIf you had really thought on this and seen no other way, I might go the other way, but the careless way you deal with a house and land that goes back so far in your family is really disappointing. Have some respect and at least try.", "OP is wasting our time. He has already decided to go for the money, despite what might be fair to his sister who, as he admitted, was left a less than equitable amount in the will. The idea that he sell off part of the land and use that money as his start up in his new life, is a great solution. His sister could then buy or rent the ranch house and keep up maintenance on it and the remaining land. That would be the honorable thing to do, but I think OP is far more self-serving than that. The grandfather probably hoped that the land would stay in the family, but should have listened to what his grandson was telling him. It sounds like a patriarchal decision on the grandfather's part,  where everything is left to the oldest son or grandson, without real thought given as to what was the right, or fair, thing to do.", "INFO:\n\nDid you sister get anything?\n\nOr did you get everything, with the understanding that you would keep in the family?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you were the only family member to get any inheritance, because it was given to you with the intent of being an heirloom that you cared for - you the asshole.

And you have willing family, work with them on a reasonable way to exchange it. \n\nIf everyone else got their own inheritance in other forms, and this was your part of it, not the asshole.

As in - did your sister get nothing? Did she get something else of similar value?", "YTA for trying to profit off of your grandfather's blatant sexism. Per your comments you got way more than her because she's a woman, so saying \"sure you can have it for face value\" means you're taking his sexism and perpetuating it. You could try to come up with a fair split but you don't want to.", "You WOULD be the asshole if you don't do whatever you can to keep the property in the family. Market value to family who did not get an equal inheritance as you on a property you got for free on the condition that is be your family home is a shitty ask, you could rent it to your sister, work out a rent to own, compromise on the cost, but using it as your get rich scheme is icky.", "\"**I told her she could have it immediately, as long as she could pay the market value for the house.\"**\n\nYTA\n\nYou get a free house that grandpa wanted to stay in the family and decide your sister should pay market value... I don't see how you could be anything other than the AH.  Not saying she should get it for free, but market value for a free house?!\n\nIf you do this, expect it to forever impact on how the rest of the family sees you for the rest of your life.", "Based on the extra information, that you for hte property out of sexism and your inheritance was larger than your sisters, YTA. I think you should work out a deal with your sister the best way you can, otherwise you are contributing to your sister getting screwed over again.", "INFO - did you talk to anyone in your family before deciding to sell?\n\nYou're right that - legally -  it is yours to do with as you please. But you also mentioned the sentimental value to your mom and your siblings. People would react better if you explained the problems you are facing maintaining a large property, rather than being told \"Hey I am selling this\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is right that you are disrespecting your grandparents wishes, but sometimes the wishes of dead relatives end up being massive burdens.", "I think completely selling everything is an AH thing to do. Post is super weird though, not sure why you keep calling your late grandfather the old man. I guess if anything, it\u2019s a lesson he\u2019ll learn in his grave. His views were misogynistic, and because of that, he left the ranch to the wrong grandkid who couldn\u2019t care less about it.", "Did your siblings get an inheritance of similar value as you? If yes, sell the house market value and NTA.  If no, why did you get it all?", "I am 100% venting here and taking it out on you, but I get perpetually angry at how it seems like the only way people in my age range can afford a house is if they get a massive inheritance. So while you are basically set for life not having to pay a full mortgage ever again after the money you just accumulated out of nowhere, I will be scraping by just to try and make a down payment on a house. \n\nYou better not be one of those people in 5-10 years trying to give people advice on what made you successful without mentioning that you got a house for free and then pocketed all the money from selling it in order to buy your next house. \n\nThe fact that you are so greedy and would only give it to your sister for market rate, when she probably should have had 50% of that inheritance to begin with, is incredibly shitty. \n\nYTA", "INFO: Did your siblings get a similar inheritance, value wise? If so, can you trade? Tell them they are welcome to the house if you can afford to pursue your life.\n\nEditing to say, while I understand the whole generational thing, times are tough, and people are not set up the way Boomers and their parents were. If selling this property allows you to be better set for a life you want, just sell the damn property.", "YTA - I cannot believe all these comments. You got this house specifically because you lied to your grandparents. Your sister got a much smaller inheritance and now you wanna sell the house and keep all the money. \n\nThis sub isn't about what's legally right. Legally you can sell the house. Morally you're TA", ">as long as she could pay the market value for the house\n\nGive her a family discount ffs.", "Ultimately, you are the one who shall live with the decision.  \n\nIf it were me, I would let my sister move in, and, I'd carry the mortgage so she could make payments.  It's all free money to you.  You're a young man, and if you invest 100% of the mortgage payments you receive, you'd have a million dollars by the time you're 50, or sooner.  It's win-win, and, it keeps the family together.  You will really enjoy going to Thanksgiving dinners there with the whole family.\n\nYou need to go to a quiet place and think about your love of your grandfather and what it meant to you.   Put yourself in his shoes and try hard to accept his convictions, even though they may differ from your own.  \n\nAnd remember, someday, you will write a will, and you will get one chance to leave something behind, something that defines your legacy.  Few people consider it at your age, and it gets more important as you age.  Think about how you might feel if the things you held dear in your life were summarily discarded by your descendants.  It's not an easy or immediate answer.  You really need to do some soul-searching.  YTA", "Why not have your sister rent from you? That way, the house is still yours if ever in 5 years she decides she wants to move (and at that time, you can sell or move back depending where you're at in life). You'd get a bit of monthly income to help with the move overseas and your sister could live in the house and keep it in the family.

It will save all these redditors offering alternatives.", "I was gonna go with a soft YTA but when you offered your sister to buy it first and she just wants it for free it definitely turned to NTA.\n\nYou were always vocal about you not wanting to live there and if your sister wanted it so much she could let her opinions be known before his death.  I'm sure she got something out of the will herself so just asking for the place with nothing in return is outrageous. She's using the rest of the family's feelings to get you to change your mind, she's an ass.\n\nEdit : after reading the comments I'm gonna have to switch to YTA. The will was totally unjust in your favor and you know it. There are other ways to deal with this than selling market value.", "YTA. Offer it to your family first.

He raises cattle and has really fixed up the place with money from selling cattle. We are happy to go visit and have it stay in our family and he is happy being a farmer.

I don't know why your grandpa gave it to you instead of having all the grandchildren have equal shares. It's understandable that your sister can't afford the house herself, but doesn't want to lose a sentimental home.

Even though you have a family member who will care for it at her expense? Personally, I think YTA, yes. You're selling out everyone else for your personal benefit. You have the right to do that, but by no means does that make you a good person when you do.\n\nYou could let her live in it, and take out a reasonable home equity loan that she can pay off, say at 40% of the property value that she pays off for the right to live in the house for X years.

And if it was like this, it's likely they would contest the will. IANAL, but I've known friend contest wills in this scenario.

OP repeatedly said he didn't want it, but sister seems pretty attached to the property AND is more likely to start a family since she's married (and if she wasn't married by the time Grandpa passed, was likely at least in this same relationship).

But the sister isn\u2019t even offering half that\u2019s just comments she\u2019s offering nothing. OP has a life they need to live too. A rental agreement possibly even a rental with the ability to convert to purchasing subtracting the amount paid in rent towards the purchase at the same terms but still at current market value not what it was in the past. That way if the sister got in the financial position to buy it they could and if they didn\u2019t then it at least stays in the family.

OP specifically said he told his grandfather numerous times he didn't want the house, and he left it to the OP anyway. He could have left it to anyone else in the family and he made the decision to leave it to someone who ACTIVELY told him he did not want it. At that point, Grandpa's wishes have officially become irrelevant.", "Yeah I'm with you there. There's definitely a middle ground here where sister obtains the property, and OP gets enough money to start his new life comfortably. Far too little information to actually give a solution on here, but I like to imagine there is one here that works things out well for everyone. \n\nWhat it really depends on though is if OP is remotely willing to take a financial hit to keep the property in the family. Which I don't think he is, and definitely makes him an AH too. He at least appears very resistant to the idea of taking under market value in his replies. I can't necessarily fault him for wanting to maximise the profit he earns from an asset, and we could be talking anything from a couple of hundred k to millions here, but the moral thing to do would be to work something out that keeps a property in the family that is definitely wanted by others in that family.", "I would hope OP would get advice before getting into anything. Like I said, I'm not a lawyers, or a notary.

That way, you both receive the same amount of inheritance", "It would be a kind compromise, she should be grateful for that since it considers everyone's needs", "Oh, I still think she should buy it from him.

No. Because its an insane ask.\n\nIf my grandparents left me a property and did not leave my sibling something of equal value I absolutely would.

The sister was given a much smaller inheritance in cash. \n\nWhat people are saying is, if OP is willing to sell this house and cash out with with a huge stack of cash that eclipses his sister's modest inheritance, that he's sort of an asshole because he is both ignoring the sentiment of the inheritance *and* benefitting from the sexist values of his grandfather.\n\nIf my grandparents left me $500k in property, and my Sister $50k, and the sole basis for me to get more was being a man? **Yeah**, I would give my sister ~$200k of that money without batting an eye when I cash it out.

Why shouldnt op?", "This is blatant misogyny and if you don't understand that, you need to get your head out of your butt.

That's basically the definition of misogyny.", "Exactly because his grandfather expected him to upkeep the property.", "That is true and I am willing to change my verdict a loytle after seeing that the sister doesn't want to pay anything. That makes her an asshole but I think the OP's attitude is also off. And the grandpa was a massive AH.", ">My issue is you can't really compare the values of an asset like a house to money.\n\nOf course you can. The number you get when it gets valued. You can minus the upkeep cost to date if you like. The only value he is enjoying currently is certainly not sentimental. It's the financial value of owning a sizable asset.", "Yes, do you? because there is absolutely no good reason for it to be used here", "Yea OP definitely sounds a bit naive here. If they\u2019re being headhunted this hard, odds are relocation costs will be partially or fully covered.
