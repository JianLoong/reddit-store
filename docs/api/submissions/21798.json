I actually do believe the brothers and I would vote for them being released from prison. Anyway, that\u2019s just to sort of give some backstory. My sister and I actually did suffer trauma at the hands of one of our parents but it wasn\u2019t SA. I don\u2019t know if that has anything to do with her attachment to the case. If it does, she may not even realize consciously. The thing is that it\u2019s not just an attachment to the case or the brothers.
