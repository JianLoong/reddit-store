Did something happen. Like you said, you were literally two or three minutes away from your destination so why wasn't there room for negotiation?", "NTA I 100% would have told her no. She can call someone else for a ride or wait in the car.", "NTA. You should never plan a trip on your precious time with this person again.\n\nThat being said she sounds like an attention seeker. It is not your fault she is afraid of waterfalls after agreeing to accompany you to a waterfall.\n\nYou have every right to be angry and let her cry in silence.", "While I can see that giving silent treatment is as aggressive as yelling at others, I do understand the feeling of not wanting to talk when I'm mad because I don't want to say things I didn't want to say while in full angry mode. I like to try to communicate after I'm calmed down to be able to tell the other person how I feel without anger clouded my judgement.\nI feel like that's what you're doing here, plus you're driving too. You didn't feel like talking and you know what that's okay. You were angry because of the reasons you had which is very valid. She could've said no from the beginning or even suggest to stay in the car and wait until you get back like your idea.\n\nI think if you were to talk to her in angry tone it won't be safe for both of you as you were driving. You don't want a whole debate while being angry, while driving and you kept you two safe in that drive home. So NTA, OP.", "NTA - I mean unless it was a hard hike straight for 15 mins and it was a lot to prep I would understand the last min backing out for 30 mins... But if she decided to no longer go on the hike why not just stay in the car for the 30 mins (okay let's say 45-60 to include time to enjoy the falls). But to start crying and throw a fit is a bit much.", "NTA, people need to learn how to respect other people's time. The least she could have done is offer to stay in the car while you went.", "NTA\n\nNot sure why she waited until you were almost there to let you know she changed her mind. The least she could do was either wait in the car or walk around a bit until you were done with your hike. I\u2019m sorry but 30mins is nothing compared to the almost 2hrs + gas you wasted", "NTA, she was super rude to ask to to turn around and the whole thing sounds ridiculously dramatic. It would have been ideal to discuss it right there and then before turning around, but I'm sure it was a pretty flabbergasting situation.", "NTA. She sounds incredibly sheltered, almost dysfunctional", "INFO: why was she crying on your way back? I feel like I didnt understood this part properly", "NTA I don't know why you should have to pretend to not be angry with your friend. She had no trouble ruining your day. She should be aware that her actions upset you. Maybe she will learn not to waste other peoples time and resources.\n\nI don't understand the cold feet. Was she scared of something?", "NTA and your friend sounds exhausting. Here\u2019s a tip for not being in these situations, don\u2019t waste time with people like her.", "Dude this is your 13th AITA post. Are you trying to get karma? NTA in this case but you already knew that.", "INFO: How did everyone find out about what happened? If she told everyone, then NTA because this is just between the two of you and you guys just needed some time to simmer down and work it out. It\u2019s perfectly ok to not feel like talking sometimes because as my grandmother used to say, \u201cIf you can\u2019t say anything nice, don\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d If you are the one that told everybody about what happened, then YTA because someone who obviously felt really badly that she let you down was made to feel even worse.", "There's some part of the story missing. Nobody just changes their mind minutes from the destination. Panic attack? Thought she was being hit on? Something had to happen. For you to not question it and just turn around without gently asking why is pretty odd.  The silent treatment can come across as very hostile so, yeah, you should apologize for putting her through that. If you were going to turn around no questions asked then you should have done it with grace and kindness.", "INFO: Were any alternatives discussed, or did she basically say she wanted to go home and you acquiesced?", "NAH. Sounds like you need to talk about that because it was upsetting for both of you. Ultimately she took care of herself by speaking up about not being comfortable. You did the right thing by taking her home even though it upset you to have to turn around. It made for an unpleasant afternoon for both of you. But part of being a safe wilderness person is managing your disappointment when someone expresses boundaries, limits, or the need to back out of an adventure. Conversely, part of being a good wilderness buddy is knowing what you're up for and communicating in advance. But sometimes people don't know they have a boundary until it gets crossed. Maybe next time you will each handle your part more gracefully.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At least tell her why you aren't talking.", "My best guess is that she felt nervous about the idea that I wasn't 100% certain on where we were going (we were on the correct road when she made this call however) but really I have no idea. I did try to negotiate but she has bad anxiety and it was flaring up so it was easier to just take her home. I also just felt uncomfortable with the idea of basically keeping a girl against her will in my car haha.", "Yeah I just felt uncomfortable with the idea of basically holding a girl in the car against her will in the wilderness haha. Plus she has bad anxiety that was obviously already starting to flare up.", "Yeah, I literally initially felt so angry that I couldn't focus on my driving and I definitely felt that if I tried to talk to her I would have just laid into her dissecting every single reason why I was upset. I did message her when I got home and was more level headed explaining why I was upset but she hasn't communicated with me since, she just left it on read.", "I don't get it, either, or how people don't think the silent treatment isn't manipulative. It might not be actively malicious, but it *is* still manipulative. People can af least say \"just give me some time to cool off\", no reason not to.", "People found out about this due to her. And yeah I agree, the reason I was silent was that I felt if I spoke all I would do was just lay into her about all the reasons that her sudden decision pissed me off.", "I did try to talk to her a little bit but she didn't really seem like there was much wiggle room so I just let it go. I stated in another comment that my best guess is that it made her anxious that I wasn't 100% confident in where we were going but I did also communicate before we left that it was in a pretty obscure area with only vague directions online. \n\nI will admit that the silent treatment isn't the best, it's definitely not something I resort to often; I just felt that any discussion I would have engaged in in the moment wouldn't have been constructive and so just decided it would have been better not to speak and then talk about it in depth when I wasn't emotional and also focusing on driving. \n\nThanks for the perspective though I genuinely appreciate it :)", "I wonder if she suddenly started her period or something.", "I briefly tried to talk her out of it but she was becoming more anxious and distressed so I decided it would just be best to take her home", ">I wasn't 100% certain on where we were going\n\nWas this conveyed to her when you told her about the trip or did it come up during the drive? \n\nWhy did you invite her and not someone else?", "So she was having an anxiety attack?", "She fucked up your day, and has the nerve to be put out that you didn't talk to her is some bs. Any one who takes her side is a fool. This is drama queen behaviour. She ruined your day and you were nice enough to turn around and take her straight home. She's a waste of time. You don't owe her a damn thing.", "Then totally NTA. You did nothing wrong other than throw a bunch of time and money down the drain because she\u2019s a buzzkill. Sorry man. Hope you have a great Thanksgiving if you celebrate it!", "If you feel like you are not capable to have productive convo bc of emotion, I recommend stating exactly that to the person. This way they at least know that you are not ignoring them, just giving yourself time to calm down before engaging", "It sounds like she\u2019s the ta but mildly, because it sounds like her anxiety was triggered for some reason, but you have every reason to be upset that you missed out on the experience that you explicitly told her about and invited to go along with you. I\u2019d be peeved myself, but to me the experience is only fun if I\u2019m sharing it with happy campers. I wouldn\u2019t be so pissed that I wouldn\u2019t talk to them at all, but I\u2019d definitely be bummed, for sure. She\u2019s the ta though because she agreed to putting herself into a situation that would affect another in such a way where there were no compromising alternatives. She should disclose that upfront if she\u2019s aware of it. And now that you\u2019re aware of it, I wouldn\u2019t invite her out to do things like that again unless you two can talk about it.", "I did explain to her before we set off that it was in kind of an obscure location and she didn't seem to mind. I invited her because at this point in time she was my go to person for road trips, it was just kind our dynamic. We've also done overnight trips together in the past.", "I don't think so, I've dated a girl with bad anxiety and my sister also has bad anxiety and this didn't really seem like that. She just seemed more like she had changed her mind and wanted to go home.", "This OP, you tried to explain your side when you calm down. I think you handled it very well and addressed it after everyone safe at home. Don't sweat it you're clearly NTA", "I'm Australian but thanks mate appreciate the sentiment :)", "Since this was a regular thing, her reaction seems really out of proportion.", "To me, it just seems alittle strange because like you said, she's your go to person for road trips and you've done this before many times. \n\nSo it seems to me like maybe she did have a reason for not wanting to go out of the blue? Like a few people mentioned, something just seems off for her to back out right at the last minute\n\nI still refer back to my initial judgement where I said there's not enough info.", "you think everyone exhibits their experience of mental health symptoms the same way?", "You literally talk about her anxiety on several other posts. You also talk about regularly road tripping with her, so I'm confused about what made her pull the plug at that point this time. It seems off. I'm not sure how much of an attempt you made to talk about it before turning around & going home, but that was your choice.\n\nI can understand some anger & disappointment, but the \"too angry to talk\" stuff ain't saying good things about you, champ.\n\nI think YTA.", "Do you have a version of American Thanksgiving?\n\nAlso, you must be having a nice spring now. Cold as hell here, lol.", "Short of getting her side of the story, I've given all of the information that I can. The only reason I can think of as I said in another comment was that she got anxious about the fact that I had a bit of a moment of confusion with where I was going. However the possibility of this happening had been mentioned prior to leaving.", "Of course not, I'm just speaking that from my many experiences of anxiety attacks it just didn't feel like one. This is also taking into account my knowledge of Mackenzie as well not just that it didn't look like my ex or my sister's attacks.", "Sorry yes I know she has anxiety but what I'm saying is that with my experiences with anxiety attacks and also what I know about Mackenzie, it just didn't feel like an anxiety attack. When I say \"too angry to talk\" I meant that I didn't feel that I could convey what I was feeling in a way that was sensible and constructive rather than making her feel even worse. I wasn't sitting there seething or anything, I just needed to wait until I was more clear-headed and also not focusing on driving. \n\nFrankly I think the fact that we've done this before many times is what makes it more out of the blue, because she's never had issues before in similar scenarios. I said in another comment that I think it might have been my uncertainty about where we were going that caused the anxiety, but I did communicate that before we left and confirming that she was still cool to come along. \nOh well.", "Haha no we don't have an equivalent unfortunately! It's actually been cold as hell here tbh, it snowed today in my state lmao.", "NTA.  Oh good grief.  If you had tried to talk to her then it would have been \u201cI was upset and they wouldn\u2019t stop talking\u201d. You were in a no win situation.  Drop the rope with her and stop trying.", "NTA.   That WAS really disrespectful and inconsiderate of your time.  I would have been hurt and angry too.", "Staying silent is better than speaking in anger. She is TA", "NTA \n\nI would have said nothing either because I would have been angry also. Your friend sounds a bit childish like you said since they don\u2019t work, they don\u2019t know how hard it is to have a free day. \n\n\nI had something similar happen. So hard to regain the trust back in the friend and go out with them again anywhere or make plans in case they get cold feet last minute and wreck the plan.", "NTA and kinda N A H. She should have chipped in for gas and explained why she suddenly wasn't feeling it AND not gone to your mutual friends to complain, but the only thing I can think of are those terrible gut feelings you suddenly get, and I'm wondering if that's what happened to her. 100% every time my partner or I have one, (like \"idk why but I have a really bad feeling about this\") we bail on whatever it is. Hasn't happened often, but when it has with either of us, we've cancelled. Regardless, you're definitely NTA for not wanting to talk through your frustration/disappointment.", "Are you a guy or girl?", "It\u2019s not \u201ctoo angry to talk\u201d it\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m frustrated and anything less than even keeled emotion free speech will set of this fragile person\u201d. He has awareness not a lack of control.", "NTA. I would have been furious.", "i always find situations like this so very weird. Cos its like, as a person self regulating your feelings is a vital part of being mature, yes?? So when youre angry-regardless of the severity of the reason-isnt being silent a good thing?? Like you just dont say anything until youre mostly sure youre not gonna explode and say something outta pocket. Thats what grownups do right?? \n\nOfc its gonna be uncomfortable for the person sitting in the silent car knowing theyre the reason its silent but like, thats just how it goes. Expecting someone youve just made angry to comfort you immediately is kinda ridiculous. Besides, being silent when theres no need for conversation isnt even harsh. \n\nNTA and im sorry you missed out on your relaxation", "NTA\n\nIt was a full disrespect for your time!\n\nEven if you would have talked to her, and whatnot, it was still plenty of motive to be pissed and to not invite her again for anything!\n\nAll my best wishes", "NTA she behaved terribly and she can\u2019t expect you to pamper herself pathetic inability to manage get own emotions.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nYou stayed quiet due to anger, not to punish her.", "Can you clarify if she was trying to talk to you, but you just didn't engage? Or were you both silent. Why would you need to initiate conversation?", "YTA. She has anxiety and you are a guy taking her to an obscure location", "YTA.  \nYour friend was in enough emotional distress that she couldn't handle the situation and you made it all about you.", "I'm not sure what else you could have done. You were taking her back to her home at her request in the safest manner. While driving you have to concentrate and cannot engage in an emotional conversation unless you pulled over in which case you would have prevented her from getting home asap.", "As if it wasn\u2019t blindingly obvious why.\n\nThere was nothing manipulative about it. OP clearly just was in no mood for conversation, understandably so.", "You are not holding her against her will, she is free to get out at any time. I am sure you would have pulled over at any stop to let her off.", "Have you asked any of the friends what she said to them about it?  How she described it to them, and what reasons she gave?  She's not talking to you... but what is she saying to them?\n\nEither they are operating on very little information... or she may be telling them things that are inaccurate, and you should set the record straight... or maybe she's letting on to them why she reacted like that, even though she hasn't told you.\n\nIt's definitely weird, and it's rude.  It's especially weird since you say that you've gone on lots of trips with her before.  You expect more from a person like that -- you expect them to give you a reasonable explanation for WHY they are bailing 3 minutes from the destination, and you expect them to realize they have wasted your time and ruined your plans, and that they ought to give you an apology.\n\nIt seems like she expects YOU to just do whatever she wants, with no explanation, if she gives some indication that her anxiety has flared up.  But, honestly, that isn't how a close friend should act.  If you're close enough friends to go on an overnight trip with her, then she should at least be able to say, \"oh gosh, I'm really sorry... I'm having an anxiety attack\" or offer ANY other explanations for this.\n\n(For the folks saying she should have just waited in the car -- it sounds a bit like this location was a bit remote?  On the one hand, it might not have been very frequented by other people; but I could see, especially if you were feeling anxiety, not wanting to sit in a car at a trailhead alone for an hour, in a location where you felt like you couldn't easily get help if you needed it, or where you might feel vulnerable to strangers.  I mean, the likelihood of someone with bad intentions happening by and deciding to act on them is very slim, but not zero.  If you're an anxious person, those kinds of fears can be amplified, out of proportion with the actual risk.)", "why is this downvoted so much wtf.."]}
