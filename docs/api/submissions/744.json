They should feel lucky you even consider them friends at this point! \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them ANY type of relationship. They DO need to know their place.", "NTA. Yea you could have said it a little better but they are the ones that are suppose to be taking the time to learn about who you are as a person and listening to you, not projecting how they feel your mother did in raising you. They gave up that responsibility. I do believe it warrants another conversation so that everyone can discuss how they feel in a calmer manner. This doesn't have to mean the end of the growth in your relationship with them because they all have ups and downs; Plus, It definitely seems as if your younger sister would benefit from having you in her life.", "NTA.  Sounds like you had a better upbringing than your siblings will have.", "NTA. Another proof that blood isn't thicker than water. Kudos to you for standing up for your mom, the woman who loved you and raised you.", "NTA. Your real mom AKA your adopted mom sounds amazing. Your bios on the other hand sound a wee bit unbalanced. They don't have a right to come in and begin criticizing your mother. You spoke your truth to them. Never feel like an AH for speaking your truth.", "NTA\n\nYou were honest. Sometimes some people weren't meant to be parents. You let your parents know gently that was probably the case with them. You were the bigger person and salvaged some relationship with them albeit, not the one they want but the one they deserve.", "NTA \nI was adopted as an infant, as well but met my bio mom in my late 20's. I consider her my friend and that's about it. Not that she's a bad person but the parent who raised and loved you is your parent, in my opinion.", "NTA. They can\u2019t drop you off to be raised by someone else then expect to have an parent/ child relationship as an adult. At least now they are under no illusions that you are not looking for a parental relationship and you will not be schooled by them.", "NTA because you said nothing that wasn't true and nothing that wasn't deserved. Honestly I wouldn't have much to do with them at all if they're going to be crappy like that.", "NTA. These people may have been biologically responsible for you being born, but that doesn't make them your family and you're not obligated to love them. Love and respect are earned, and you're well within your rights to not give either to people that you don't like, regardless of their DNA.\n\nAlso, these people are jerks for ruining their kid's Halloween. Did they think she would try to turn herself into a witch or something? Let the kid dress up and have fun!! Seriously, OP, sounds like you should be thankful that life worked out the way that it did, I think you ended up with the better mom.", "NTA - They created and held a belief of how this connection would go. They don't care and/or do not have the skills to navigate getting to know you. You are an adult; an opportunity they gave. Yes, they are waltzed in and insulted your mom; a beautiful soul that encouraged magical fun, personal expression, etc. I would not stand for it either. Perhaps it is best you are learning about their character but their comments are hard to stomach. Best to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your Bios sound like dicks.", "NTA, and they ARE NOT your parents. While they may have given you their DNA, they didn't raise you. They weren't the ones who were there while you were growing up, when you got sick or hurt. They absolutely have zero input on how you were raised and should know their place.", "NTA. You're never wrong for setting boundaries. I'll probably be downvoted for this but I'll say it anyway:  you need to be sure to practice what you preach, boundaries should work both ways. You may not agree with the way your bio parents are raising their child, but you should respect it. You convinced them to change their minds about letting their daughter dress up as a witch and you confronted them about their response to the costume. I get that you were just advocating for the child, but you did it in a way a family member  would, not a friend. You commented on how they are raising their child, but you don't appreacte them commenting on the way your mom raised you. That's not fair.", "NTA this is an awkward situation time and very emotional. You\u2019re not moving in with them or anything, just communicating with them? They really can\u2019t say anything to you. But on one hand you can\u2019t tell them how to raise their kid.", "NTA... yup. Respect the parent that raised your children. Rule #1", "NTA. They have no right to comment about your upbringing. They lost that when they gave you up. It's good that you told them upfront what kind of relationship to expect from you.", "NTA at all. they overstepped. and to make it even worse commented on ur mothers parenting? no. they needed a dose of reality", "NTA. Besides the fact that you're an adult, they have zero say about anything you say or do. They signed those rights away 19 years ago. Do you even want or need them in your life? You owe them nothing.", "NTA. I can't even see how they can be classed as friends.", "NTA what do they mean by \"they weren't going to be like that\"? They are not your parents. They don't get to parent you now. Thankfully, so it seems. You are entitled to set the parameters of any relationship you may whish to have going forward.", "NTA. Honestly, I admire your restraint.\n\nImagine thinking you have to clarify to people that your 6yo isn\u2019t actually a witch on Halloween.\n\nSix months in to establishing a relationship, they should be honoured you called them friends.", "NTA your bio parents are the massive AH'S in this situation  You don't owe them a relationship and I'm so happy that you had a amazing mom.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt actually wasn\u2019t mean at all. Don\u2019t worry", "NTA - What the fuck kind of right do they have saying \u201cthey weren\u2019t going to be like that\u201d?? As if they have anything resembling a parental role with you. They overstepped big time in this whole interaction.", "NTA and the only reason you might want to maintain any contact with these AHs is to provide your little sister with someone she can talk to when her asshole-parents do their next asshole-move.", "NTA\n\nYou have a mom (no other adjective needed IMO) and it's not their place to comment. They are birth givers and that's it. \n\nObviously this will be a process but no matter what they'll never be your parents, that ship sailed, so friends or extended family is really as good as it will ever get.", "NTA- They insulted your mom and were extremely rude. Not to mention crazy, since most 6 year olds know they aren't actually witches on Halloween.", "MTA you have absolutely nothing to feel bad about", "NTA and your mom sounds amazing! I sincerely hope your siblings can find positive outlets for their interests. If anything, it was generous to call your bioparents \"friends\"", "NTA. If they wanted to parent you, they should've kept you. Sounds your siblings won't be dealing with them too often in the future either.", "Maybe I\u2019m neurotic but it almost sounds like they reached out for a relationship so they could conveniently take on a \u201cparents of a young adult\u201d role with you, as if your adoptive mom was fostering you and they\u2019re ready to step in now - if they already see themselves as your new parents. It\u2019s weird! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s AH of you to tell them to recognize and stay in their own lanes. NTA", "Maybe for how you said it but not the gist of it.", "THIS RIGHT HERE.  Their comments re your mom being \"soft\" were uncalled for. Of course you were going to get upset. You established a boundary, and hopefully they will respect it. NTA at all.", "I\u2019m right there with you. No one better insult my REAL mom. I don\u2019t care if she isn\u2019t biologically mine. She\u2019s an angel on earth. My mom always said if she could\u2019ve birthed us she would\u2019ve.", "NTA.  What do the sibs call adopted you?  \"The lucky one.\"", "You are NTA, and they are not your parents. They did not raise, you, you have no history with them, and you don't have shared values.  \n\nI am a firm believer that adoptees have the right to know who their biological parents are, and I am an equally firm believer that they don't have to act on the information.", "They\u2019ve known you *six months*. I\u2019ve had longer relationships with cashiers at Walmart, and that\u2019s not even an exaggeration. They should feel lucky you want a relationship at all, yet they\u2019re waltzing in and burning bridges by insulting your mom. Don\u2019t feel guilty, you\u2019ve done absolutely nothing wrong. That shiny titanium spine will take you far in life. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI imagine a lot of your biological parents' kids are going to also consider them friends at best in the future.", "NTA - my parents are very similar. At least your sister has you, because she\u2019s got one hell of a hard ride yet.", "NTA. way to clap back on the spot", "NTA. You wouldn\u2019t want to be soft of them.", "NTA\n\nyour bio sounds like a super conservative people.. you dodged a massive bullet there", "NTA\n\nyour mom sounds absolutely wonderful.\n\n And they have no right to come in as authoritarian figures. You're an adult. the parenting stage of your life is effectively over. And any more parental roles needed will be filled by the woman who raised you. They have no say whatso ever in your life. You were right, they need to know their place.", "NTA\n\nThey ARE friends at best. The relationship you get to have now is one that both you and them get to come into as equals. I\u2019m in a family with several generations of adoptees and various levels of relationships with all the bio-families, but ALL of the successful relationships are where both parties are going into it because they want to: they respect the other person and respect that the life they had was different, and the relationship has to be built from now, not some misguided idea of what the past *could* have been.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe your bio-parents a relationship, especially when they seem to want to jump in and like \u2026 parent you extra hard? To like make up for the 19 years they didn\u2019t\u2026?????\n\nI\u2019m sad that you potentially won\u2019t get to have a relationship with them, because in my own family I\u2019ve seen some lovely bio-relationships exist. If you feel like you\u2019d be heard and respected, you might want to tell them that while you are sorry for how you phrased it the other night, you aren\u2019t sorry for what you said: and then lay out some boundaries and expectations. And honestly, they might be nervous too \u2026 like, not knowing exactly how to interact with you yet, since the relationship is new for them too. BUT. Even if that\u2019s a good reason, it\u2019s not an excuse for them to continue to treat you in a way you don\u2019t like.\n\nNTA, OP!", "NTA. They're lucky to be considered friends and not referred to as deadbeat 1 and 2. On the bright side they gave you EVEN more reasons to appreciate your real mom. Hope you manage to stay in your siblings life as a positive balance to the bioparents.", "NTA. You owe them exactly nothing. When your sibs are older you may feel like reaching out to them, maybe individually. Right now you're not really in a position to make the sibs' lives easier. Spending more time with this couple just opens you up to nastiness and cruelty. Remember, these ARE people who gave you up.", "NTA  \n\n\nHello fellow adoptee  \n\n\nmy reunions were terrible, so I understand  \n\n\nYou have every right to feel exactly how you feel. You love your adoptive mom and it sounds like she was wonderful to you. They have no room to say squat about her and should respect your boundaries.   \n\n\nReunion can be really hard. I would definitely suggest finding someone to talk to who is not part of your particular triad. That way you can get a fresh outsider perspective.", ">I was fuming at this point, because in my head I was like \"you really think you can just waltz into my life and insult my mother's parenting??\"\n\nSounds fair to me. Are you sure you want to deal with these people?", "NTA.  It sounds like they thought they could come into your life and be seen as parents.  They aren't your parents.  They are your sperm and egg donors.  You have a mom, and a lovely mom at that!  The donors needed to hear that you don't and never will consider them 'parents' to you.", "NTA. Parents raised you. Bio friends at best nicest way to put it.", "NTA - whoa! Not cool to diss your mom. I wouldn\u2019t spend any more time with them. And be sure to tell your REAL mom how much you love and appreciate her.", "Perfect answer.  \nI\\`d copy it - but i\\`ll give you an upvote instead.", "They don't sound like friends either.", "Ha! That\u2019s funny. Thanks."]}
