{"id": 7717, "submission_id": "10ft2q7", "title": "AITA For Not Allowing a \"Second Season\" of My Podcast?", "selftext": "I (27F) started a podcast in 2019 with my friend and Ted (27M) which gained a small, but substantial following. The concept of the podcast was that he and I would each research and tell one another a ghost story while sipping a cocktail that was specifically created for each episode. Ted and I co-hosted. I ran the social media, created all the cocktails (I am a professional mixologist), and created the intro music. Ted took care of the sound editing. We had so much fun recording it and I was sad when we stopped. We had recorded 60 episodes at the time, no small feat in my opinion! As far as I knew we stopped recording because things had gotten busy in Ted's life, what with an impending move and a new job. I was disappointed but I understood.\n\nWell, in the past year, Ted has disappeared from my life. I understood that it was because his girlfriend Mary (26F) did not like me, as she told this to several of our mutual friends. Ted and I had been close friends for seven years so that was a tough pill to swallow, but I accepted it.\n\nFast forward a couple weeks ago. My friend showed me something that I did not expect at all. Mary and Ted have started recording \"season two\" of the podcast he and I started. I was not asked about this at all, or even informed about it by Ted. They use the same format and the same title. All the episodes he and I recorded are still there, so it looks as though the same exact podcast is being continued. Then, I went to our shared gmail and soundcloud accounts, only to find that the passwords have been changed without my knowledge.\n\nI'm not comfortable with my name, my voice, or my work being associated with something that is out of my hands. I also don't want them to remove the first 60 episodes that I worked so hard to create. The only acceptable way forward, in my opinion, is for them to delete the \"season two\" episodes that they recorded and start a  new project. I also feel that the gmail and soundcloud passwords should be shared with me so that I can access my own intellectual property.\n\nI sent Ted and Mary an email outlining the above. They are more than welcome to start their own project, but they are not welcome to use a platform I helped curate for their own benefit. I also asked for the passwords to our shared accounts. I have a great deal of intellectual property proving my involvement in this project including: research, the instagram page, the music, cocktail recipes, cocktail photos, and exchanges between myself and the artist I paid to create our logo.\n\nSome people have said I should just let this go, since it's not that big of a deal. But to me it is a big deal. I loved this project. I don't want my intellectual property used for a project I am no longer part of. So, Reddit.

You should get an IP lawyer involved asap. When someone uses your work without paying you it\u2019s considered theft.", "You got Zuckerberg'd.  Retain counsel because they stole from yous.  NTA.", "NTA. You put a lot of work into that podcast--I know, because I was a producer for a podcast. It sounds to me like the first season isn't solely your intellectual property, but also Ted's, but that doesn't mean that he can do what he wants with it. It should be a shared decision. (I'm not speaking from a legal standpoint here, but rather from an ethical standpoint.) He had no business shutting you out of the accounts associated with that podcast, and he and Mary should have consulted you before continuing the podcast.", "So this is tough because legally and morally things might be different. I can't give you detailed legal advice, but if Ted doesn't see things like you do, you're going to need it.\n\nMorally, NTA. The fact that Ted is using your shared branding and audience without even talking to you is a clear jerk move. If he had talked to you, the nice thing to do would have been to record a goodbye message, agree on future revenue distribution, and then let them make season 2 without you. \n\nBut since he didn't reach out? I say go nuclear.", "NTA the sheer audacity people have these days is crazy. Sounds like you need to see about contacting a lawyer as others have already said.

You worked so hard to create all those episodes with Ted. Ted should\u2019ve at least given you a heads up before starting a season two. Sounds like Ted and his gf have no boundaries. I\u2019m glad you sent him an email about it. If there\u2019s no response, I would definitely look into some legal ways to stop this (if you feel this passionate about this continuing on).", "NTA - also, name of podcast?

Even worse that it is someone that caused a rift in your friendship in the first place.
