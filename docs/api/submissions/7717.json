We had so much fun recording it and I was sad when we stopped. We had recorded 60 episodes at the time, no small feat in my opinion! As far as I knew we stopped recording because things had gotten busy in Ted's life, what with an impending move and a new job. I was disappointed but I understood.\n\nWell, in the past year, Ted has disappeared from my life. I understood that it was because his girlfriend Mary (26F) did not like me, as she told this to several of our mutual friends. Ted and I had been close friends for seven years so that was a tough pill to swallow, but I accepted it.\n\nFast forward a couple weeks ago. My friend showed me something that I did not expect at all. Mary and Ted have started recording \"season two\" of the podcast he and I started. I was not asked about this at all, or even informed about it by Ted. They use the same format and the same title. All the episodes he and I recorded are still there, so it looks as though the same exact podcast is being continued. Then, I went to our shared gmail and soundcloud accounts, only to find that the passwords have been changed without my knowledge.\n\nI'm not comfortable with my name, my voice, or my work being associated with something that is out of my hands. I also don't want them to remove the first 60 episodes that I worked so hard to create. The only acceptable way forward, in my opinion, is for them to delete the \"season two\" episodes that they recorded and start a  new project. I also feel that the gmail and soundcloud passwords should be shared with me so that I can access my own intellectual property.\n\nI sent Ted and Mary an email outlining the above. They are more than welcome to start their own project, but they are not welcome to use a platform I helped curate for their own benefit. I also asked for the passwords to our shared accounts. I have a great deal of intellectual property proving my involvement in this project including: research, the instagram page, the music, cocktail recipes, cocktail photos, and exchanges between myself and the artist I paid to create our logo.\n\nSome people have said I should just let this go, since it's not that big of a deal.

Copyright lawyers would know exactly how OP should handle this.", "Just my advice as someone who's gone with friends on initial consultations: You can usually get a consultation for cheap, but it's a limited amount of time, so you want to make the most of it. Make sure you have a timeline of events laid out in advance, so you can refer to it as you talk and won't leave anything out when you're explaining this.\n\nIf you and Ted had any legal documents specific to the podcast (a joint authorship agreement, a trademark registration, etc.) be sure to bring them with you, too.", "Well, assuming they didn't have any legal agreements or register anything, the original episodes are joint copyright, and if Ted has monetized them further, he has a duty to account for all profits to OP, and split them fairly.\n\nSeems like what's happening here would be more of a trademark infringement? Because it doesn't sound like Ted is trying to license the old episodes in a way that excludes OP, he's just capitalizing on the brand he and OP already created.\n\nI'm going to assume OP and Ted didn't register the trademark for their initial podcast. Honestly, I'm not sure exactly how trademark rights work for a podcast, which is an online-only product, but if he talks to a lawyer he might just need to register the trademark and then be able to stop Ted and Mary's version of the show from continuing.", "Why would a lawyer know anything about copywriting?", "... can someone explain the connection other than alcoholics being alcoholics?", "Im not a lawyer, go ask them.", "The answer is they don't.", "Cool, thanks for contributing.", "Cool.

This is a huge deal.  Send a cease and desist and insist that you be given access to the online accounts where your intellectual property is located.

It sounds like you did the majority of the creative work and now they want to capitalize on this without including you.", "I would also ensure you document ALL of season one via video recording now in case they go to delete all your episodes.
