I knew her from long before I started seeing her son. I saw her as my own mother. We kept close contact up until the end. When I found out she'd passed I was devastated. Her funeral was yesterday and I went without receiving an invite (didn't know you needed an invite to a funeral but I guess this is important for later).\n\nIf you didn't get it from the title, I'm pregnant with my ex's child. Unfortunate situation since he's back with his wife and things are tense but that's the current situation. I was going there just for the funeral and to pay respect to an amazing women who was treated me like her own child. I even sat at the back so as to avoid getting attention however attention came and my ex's wife came to me saying that I was not invited and crashing the funeral so I must leave. Luckily my ex's older brother intervened and said that I was welcomed. The only problem is that after this he basically forced me to sit further in the front (literally put his arm around me and led me to the front despite me saying I was fine) to sit in the row reserved for family, directly behind my ex, his wife and their kids. While people were looking at the body (open casket) their kids saw me they came to hug me and noticed my stomach was big so asked if I was pregnant. Their mother butted in and made a snarky comment like \"yes darlings, she just can't stop making them\". Mind you I only have one other child so this comment was purely just to make me sound like some loose woman. But still, I bit my tongue. \n\nThe youngest then asked if the child will have my red hair and her mother scoffed and under her breath said something like God forbid. So I was like maybe but your dad has brown hair so the baby could just look exactly like you guys since the baby would be their younger sister or brother. Their mother overheard this and immediately called the kids back to her. I left as soon as the funeral was over. I got a call later that night from my ex saying that I was an asshole for telling their kids about the baby without talking to them first and told me to stay away from his family.

I don't know others' coping but I tend to hold my tongue for three strikes every day. Meaning everyday those strikes reset for me. I will only say something if that rule has been broken. \nChildren are very impressionable and do pick up everything to an extent, so hearing whatever their mom could say about their unborn sibling they could retain and repeat, especially if they are young enough and don't understand the implications of what is being said. They don't just learn in school, they learn from home life too. \nThat's where the ESH comes in because children ARE being used as a weapon, even if OP unknowingly said it in that manner or not. It simply wasn't the place to continue or end it, the funeral being a special circumstance to me. Emotions are probably all over the place and very high so I give myself more strikes. \nI feel like this entire situation is tricky, and honestly a mess that probably didn't even mean to happen on your end OP, because tbh I'd start feeling a little upset after those comments being told to your unborn child's future step siblings, with my pregnancy hormones, and my worry about the whole family dynamic in this situation, I'd also probably just outright speak plainly to correct what information the children's mother was giving them, especially if their mother is allowing said children to be up to and speaking directly to me and have a chance of repeating what their mother said. So I am saying I understand why you spoke up eventually.\nThat being said-\nSometimes it's smarter to simply be quiet in this sense, because you can turn that mother's own play against her. \nImagine how it would look on her if her children actually walked around and said these things. Imagine being a grown adult and actually saying these awful grown up things to children that don't sound old enough to form their own basic opinion on adult situations such as this? I wouldn't hesitate to point that out the moment it starts, if it does. Go the legal routes, whichever routes they may be if there are any. If you're worried about the future where your child may spend time in their home without you there, make sure to communicate with your child to tell you literally everything that is done or said about him, but not yourself, because I know the legal routes for child abuse can be extensive against the ones that did it. Essentially, don't feed the fire and don't even attempt to stamp on the flames because sometimes you're gonna end up burning your feet and getting blamed for someone else's arson attempt. Just let them get the bill for damages and the records on top. Reminder, you ARE better than them. Don't let them catch you slipping anymore.", "ESH you could have been more diplomatic with the kids.
