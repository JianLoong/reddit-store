I knew her from long before I started seeing her son. I saw her as my own mother. We kept close contact up until the end. When I found out she'd passed I was devastated. Her funeral was yesterday and I went without receiving an invite (didn't know you needed an invite to a funeral but I guess this is important for later).\n\nIf you didn't get it from the title, I'm pregnant with my ex's child. Unfortunate situation since he's back with his wife and things are tense but that's the current situation. I was going there just for the funeral and to pay respect to an amazing women who was treated me like her own child. I even sat at the back so as to avoid getting attention however attention came and my ex's wife came to me saying that I was not invited and crashing the funeral so I must leave. Luckily my ex's older brother intervened and said that I was welcomed. The only problem is that after this he basically forced me to sit further in the front (literally put his arm around me and led me to the front despite me saying I was fine) to sit in the row reserved for family, directly behind my ex, his wife and their kids. While people were looking at the body (open casket) their kids saw me they came to hug me and noticed my stomach was big so asked if I was pregnant. Their mother butted in and made a snarky comment like \"yes darlings, she just can't stop making them\". Mind you I only have one other child so this comment was purely just to make me sound like some loose woman. But still, I bit my tongue. \n\nThe youngest then asked if the child will have my red hair and her mother scoffed and under her breath said something like God forbid. So I was like maybe but your dad has brown hair so the baby could just look exactly like you guys since the baby would be their younger sister or brother. Their mother overheard this and immediately called the kids back to her. I left as soon as the funeral was over. I got a call later that night from my ex saying that I was an asshole for telling their kids about the baby without talking to them first and told me to stay away from his family.

No. They were separated. When we started dating it had already been 10 months of separation and we dated for a year after that. During that whole time she also was having her own relationships. Their relationship was over. Both were living like singles.\n\nAnd the reason they even tried again to reconcile was because she was planning on moving back home (different country) after the divorce was eventually finalised and he didn't want to be away from his kids so I backed off and they gave it another shot. I'm not even trying to say they don't have love between them because they obviously married for a reason but this narrative of me being some side chick rebound while they planned to reconcile couldn't be further from the truth.", "Where is all the anger for the dude here??

And if she was that close to her exes mother, I think she deserved to be there. Maybe a mistake due to lack of invitation, but I think it was an innocent mistake where they aren\u2019t an AH and wife/ex should not have been immediately angry and respected her relationship with the departed. \n\nAlso the wife was being a bitch, though people don\u2019t typically like their partners ex so ok whatever.

How is my situation different from a poly relationship from a legal standpoint? That's where you're coming from right when you call me a side chick and our relationship and affair?

I don't know others' coping but I tend to hold my tongue for three strikes every day. Meaning everyday those strikes reset for me. I will only say something if that rule has been broken. \nChildren are very impressionable and do pick up everything to an extent, so hearing whatever their mom could say about their unborn sibling they could retain and repeat, especially if they are young enough and don't understand the implications of what is being said. They don't just learn in school, they learn from home life too. \nThat's where the ESH comes in because children ARE being used as a weapon, even if OP unknowingly said it in that manner or not. It simply wasn't the place to continue or end it, the funeral being a special circumstance to me. Emotions are probably all over the place and very high so I give myself more strikes. \nI feel like this entire situation is tricky, and honestly a mess that probably didn't even mean to happen on your end OP, because tbh I'd start feeling a little upset after those comments being told to your unborn child's future step siblings, with my pregnancy hormones, and my worry about the whole family dynamic in this situation, I'd also probably just outright speak plainly to correct what information the children's mother was giving them, especially if their mother is allowing said children to be up to and speaking directly to me and have a chance of repeating what their mother said. So I am saying I understand why you spoke up eventually.\nThat being said-\nSometimes it's smarter to simply be quiet in this sense, because you can turn that mother's own play against her. \nImagine how it would look on her if her children actually walked around and said these things. Imagine being a grown adult and actually saying these awful grown up things to children that don't sound old enough to form their own basic opinion on adult situations such as this? I wouldn't hesitate to point that out the moment it starts, if it does. Go the legal routes, whichever routes they may be if there are any. If you're worried about the future where your child may spend time in their home without you there, make sure to communicate with your child to tell you literally everything that is done or said about him, but not yourself, because I know the legal routes for child abuse can be extensive against the ones that did it. Essentially, don't feed the fire and don't even attempt to stamp on the flames because sometimes you're gonna end up burning your feet and getting blamed for someone else's arson attempt.

Ex and his wife were separated to be divorced. Both were dating other people, nothing was hidden. The kids knew OP as their dad's gf. No affair was happening.

Both ex and wife knew that OP was pregnant prior to the funeral. OP sat at the back to not draw attention. It was only after the wife confronted her that the drama happened. The older brother knew OP had been close to his mom so ushered her to the front because he felt that she belonged there.

I barred my sister-in/law from my husbands funeral, and made it clear to my brother if she showed up, she would be forcibly removed. \n\nMy husband didn\u2019t like her, I hadn\u2019t spoke to her in over a year, and I didn\u2019t need her gloating over his casket while we all dealt with his loss. \n\nEverything depends on context and circumstance. I think OP is not the AH due to the long-standing close relationship with the deceased, but in those cases, I go in, sign the book, pass my condolences to those I know need them and spend my moment at the box. I then leave.", "It\u2019s easier to blame you, then blame her husband. They should have either stayed split up. Or he Should have gotten fixed before he started having sex with anyone else.", "So her needs as a friend of the deceased trump to one of the deceased actual family? \n\nNah, there are tiers to mourning. She was not in the inner circle and she was not entitled to put her wants ahead of the actual family.", "I reread it and edited my comment. It wasn\u2019t about cheating anyway it was about bringing the child into a grown up matter at her Grandmothers funeral out of spite .", "I think you\u2019re awesome \ud83d\ude0e \nHe and his wife knew about the pregnancy so she should have kept her mouth shut about you making babies, when she knew it was with her husband! She needs some honey in her tea because she is so bitter. I\u2019m proud of you for going and congratulations on your baby!", "So - you think having a baby by a married man, crashing his mothers funeral and telling his kids about their kid was a cool move?", "Mom and dad already knew about the pregnancy. No this shouldn't have been new information to hear at a funeral or to hear from OP... But that's a failure of the married couple. In order to avoid drama, the responsibility was on them to talk to the children ahead of time. That's what parenting is.", "Nope, you're right; the parents should have told them before this \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Just to point out, this isn't drama dumping on kids. Parents separated. OP had a relationship with the father during that time. Saying that the child she is carrying was their sibling isn't mind boggling. Hell the phrasing was pretty perfect when dealing with kids. There was no snark, no bitterness. Just a \"well they might have my red hair or because you share a dad they might look like him the way you do\". The wife is the one making drama out of the whole situation.", "So, I've been seeing a lot of things about \"being invited to a funeral.\" In the olden days, we all just read the obits in a regular paper. Now it's more social media or just the online papers. People don't actually send out invites to funerals today, like weddings, do they? You just know because you're a close friend or relative or a friend or acquaintance who was told or read about it somewhere. I mean, you just GO to a funeral. No RSVPs needed.\n\nOP was a close friend of the deceased. Ex's wife got upset. Brother was nice to intervene, but probably let her stay as seated.\n\nNTA at all.", "That also ignores the jabs that the wife took at the ex though to begin with that the ex already held her tongue about. I don't expect her to put up with every single sling of abuse", "I'm not saying I approve of OP making her comment there and then but the wife is deluded. She hasn't told her kids about this baby yet and instead of just allowing OP to pay respects quietly she causes a scene and draws attention to the situation.", "Oh c'mon, the chances of \"everyone getting along\" in this situation isn't even 0, it's like -20. Wifey started shit and specifically included her kids in the shit. OP actually put an end to it and didn't tell them anything they weren't going to find out anyways.", "It wasn\u2019t until the wife made not one but two snide comments in front of the children.  And with at least one of them old enough to be catching meaning\n\nShe doesn\u2019t need to be OP\u2019s bestie, but her husband\u2019s the one who fathered a child while separating and I have zero tolerance for slut shaming.\n\nIf you attempt to do that to me on front of kids, I will correct you loudly in front of kids, even if I don\u2019t know any of you.  The guy she\u2019s mad at is her husband but she wants to be with him so OP is the punching bag.  Shitty message for a teenage girl and she found out what happens.", "Funerals may be for the living, but isn\u2019t she part of the living? Doesn\u2019t she deserve to have closure and attend a service for a woman who was like a mother to her? The other son wanted her there too, so you can\u2019t even say that the immediate family were unified in wanting to exclude her.", "She wasn't in the inner circle of the ex, but she clearly was to the person whos funeral it actually was. Funerals are an open event, the wake or food/drinks after are the private part", "She didn't crash the funeral, the funeral was open. Exs brother broadcast the details on FB for all who wanted to attend. \n\nIt would only be crashing if she tried to go to the private party afterwards", "The older brother gets some blame too as he could have just let OP stay at the back and not made her sit with the family. The majority of this may have been avoided had OP been able to just blend into the back as intended. Without knowing if he knew about the pregnancy I can\u2019t decide is he\u2019s just 10% AH or 80%.", "They're children\n\nMom and dad should have told them about them about their sibling before if they really wanted to avoid drama, and perhaps OP figured they knew. It seems like a standard assumption to me.", "And from OP. She did this out of pettiness.", "That's on their father for not telling them yet.", "Beyond this the ex-wife knew that the baby was their half sibling and implied OP was slutty and it was from someone else.  I agree it was inappropriate to say what OP said, but the ex tried to weaponize the pregnancy via those kids first.  Both are equally at fault and ESH for that.  \n\nGoing to the funeral of someone you were close to I do not see fault with and sitting at the back to not be disruptive was the right way to go.  I have cousins who are siblings that do not talk, but both attended the funeral of another Uncle and stayed at different ends of the church.  The ex-wife asking OP to leave is an AH move as OP had a close relationship with the deceased and other family members openly stated she was welcome at the funeral.  Asking anyone who was on good terms and close to the deceased to leave a funeral because of your own personal issue is not OK.", "Agreed. Hence the ESH.", "The question she asked us was if she was an asshole for telling the kids without talking to their actual parents first, which is what my YTA judgment is on. I\u2019m not calling her an asshole because I think she\u2019s the only wrong person in this entire situation but that isn\u2019t what Op asked us to come in here and judge her for. My judgment is she\u2019s TA because when you involve children that aren\u2019t even yours and who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening it\u2019s a hard no from me, especially because she did it to be snarky back at their mom in the middle of a funeral, it would be disingenuous to say Op said what she did from the goodness of her heart with no ill intention. Don\u2019t involve kids in your drama. If she wants to respond with the same energy to her ex\u2019s wife, fine, but 100% you will be the asshole the second you use some kids to do it", "I get the feeling the other son is fed up with ex\u2019s wife and possibly ex also.  Since OP\u2019s relationship with mom predated her relationship ship with ex and then she dated him for a year, he is probably on at least friendly terms with OP. The wife pitching a fit over the relationship he started after 8 months of separation and while she was also dating, must be exhausting as hell. You separated for almost 2 years, and then got back together, shit happened in between. If you can\u2019t live peacefully with the consequences of your decisions don\u2019t get back together. I\u2019m sure other son wasn\u2019t happy about the shrew engaging in a cold war at his mother\u2019s funeral, with his mother\u2019s friend and soon to be mother of his niece or nephew. \n\nHim bringing her upfront with him reads as either I need to protect you OP or an FU to the wife. Hell, maybe it was both, but OP tried to be respectfully in the back and let the first few digs slide. I highly doubt the wife was going to stop until she was made to, and this was probably the least intrusive way to make it stop. You\u2019re gonna be a petty little liar, I\u2019ll answer with the truth. Game, set, shut up. Sad that the kids got dragged into it at that moment, but if she\u2019s showing they probably should have already told them or at least their mom shouldn\u2019t have kept bringing attention to it.", "This is obviously not the situation here but the family of a guy I know listed the memorial service as \"private\" because he was a junkie, thief, and sexual predator and people would have showed up in droves to piss on his grave.

Ever. Its rude and yes - it is crashing in terms of showing up where you know you're unwanted.", "Nah, OP was already minding her own business when her ex's wife made a point to be hostile and try to kick her out.

He clearly sees OP as family and knew his mother would have wanted her treated as family.", ">and perhaps OP figured they knew. It seems like a standard assumption to me\n\nUhm... Something about the kids being surprised and asking her if she was pregnant makes me a bit doubtful but maybe I'm wrong.\n\nExactly their kids.

I\u2019d have said \u201cdear god, I can certainly see why you two separated\u201d.\n\nTBF, I also wouldn\u2019t have gone to the funeral, but I don\u2019t know the extent of OP and the mother.", "I'm thinking how their own mother responds to things would have a bigger impact than essentially a stranger. So I would think that they would put more stock on what momma said than someone they don't look up to or listen to for instructions on life", "She answered the children with a direct and honest answer, if she had just said or the baby might look like it's dad they probably would have pressed further (kids i know would have) and she  would either have to tell them anyway or lie to them.\n\nThere was no affair therefore nothing was inappropriate about the relationship in that respect but if she had lied it would have implied that she felt there was and then the EXs wife would be validated for the way she was treating OP and probably continued or escalated her verbal attacks on OP and while it probably wasn't her intention, by bringing truthful to the kids she may have given herself a little bit of protection from the exs wife, and maybe even started building a bit of a report with the kids allowing them to feel comfortable visiting with their sibling knowing that OP will be honest with them and respect them", "How do you know that?", "But it's on OP for telling them there and then.", "Agreed", "My boyfriend has been separated for four years.

Slut shaming brings us all down.", "She wasn\u2019t the dad\u2019s side chick. He and the wife were fully separated. His relationship with OP was public and the kids knew about it.

You weren't making an announcement, you were talking openly about something any reasonable person would assume was already known.\n\nAdvice, I wouldn't let them have any custody of the baby if you can help it.

The next morning, you meet at the funeral home briefly (usually about an hour or so), then get in the procession behind the hearse to the church where the mourners follow the casket inside (this is where OP should have slipped in behind the mourners and sit in the back pews). Then you have the funeral mass and the mourners follow the casket back out and rejoin the procession to the cemetery to conclude the funeral services. \n\nAnd until the divorce papers are finalized and signed and filed and everything, the people are still married.

And not just completely erased out of existence like he clearly wants by the fact that he hasn\u2019t told his children yet about their half sibling. The only blame I could possibly assign to you relies on how old the kids are/did you assume they would know about the sibling already.

Be realistic people get separated and date all the time, we don\u2019t know if the wife was dating too or not while they were separated. Also ESH the wife started making comments in front of her children that were not appropriate that she could have kept to herself. OP just reacted to it. Peoples reaction would be different if the husband stayed separated.", "I'm leaning towards NTA. You were at the funeral to mourn a woman you loved. You tried not to draw attention to yourself by sitting in the back. You even tried to act civil when the kids came up to you. I definitely don't fault you for saying what you said because:\n\n1. You didn't start anything. You bit your tongue when the wife was throwing insults your way. In fact, it seems like you danced around telling them you are carrying their sibling until the wife's constant remarks got to you.\n2. What you said IS true. First, the kids asked if you were pregnant, and you held back. It's not like you flat out said, \"oh yeah, my tummy is big because I'm pregnant with your sibling\". THEN they asked whether the baby's hair would be red or not. You answered the kids' questions by simply stating the hair color might be different because of their father.\n\nSure, you could have said something like, \"I don't know, we'll see!\" rather than giving a hint that you're carrying your ex's child. However, I feel that you felt forced into saying something clever because you were being verbally attacked by the wife. I can understand that because we all have our limits. On top of that, had you said something \"more tactful\" like the above example, I doubt the wife would have stopped when she did. I can picture her continuing to make snide remarks, regardless if the kids kept asking more and more questions. What you said was able to effectively shut the wife down and have the rest of the funeral continue in relative peace.\n\nAll in all, you didn't say anything that would attack the character of the wife, ex, or kids. Additionally, nothing else was exchanged after the kids were called back. The kids seemed happy to see you and don't care that you're pregnant with their sibling. If the wife and your ex are bothered by what you said, well, that's the consequence of THE WIFE starting a spat.

Why, because you told the truth? A truth that their parents should have already been preparing their children for especially since you're already showing. But because you didnt check with the people being unnecessarily agressive with you, you some how the ah. You are not under any obligation to hide the truth, especially in a situation where you did not do a thing wrong or inappropriate. If the parents didn't want that can of worms to be opened then they could have taken so many steps first. But again, another person is not obligated to lie for your children. What did they expect to hide this from them until the accidently found out?\n\nI find it funny that the wife didn't realize that in insulting you, she was insulting her *husband*. He's the one who had a relationship with someone who according to her is loose and that child she is talking crap about it his, just like hers are... I'm sure that marriage is stable. Make sure to sue for full custody and child support because she will not be kind to your child if you split custody.

I don't think answering a kid's question in an honest and imo pretty tasteful manner counts as involving the kids in your drama. If ex's wife didn't want the kids asking you questions she should keep them next to her, not let them go over to you. But she was just fine with that when it gave her the chance for a snarky remark! Just not when you set out plainly and nonjudgmentally that you were carrying their sibling. Personally I think she's mad she didn't get to announce their new half sibling in a way that poisons them toward the baby from the outset, she sounds like being bitter and getting in cheap shots at you is her number one priority right now.", "NTA OP, I think you should update your post with the info you've mentioned in your comments.
