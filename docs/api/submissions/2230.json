I was going there just for the funeral and to pay respect to an amazing women who was treated me like her own child. I even sat at the back so as to avoid getting attention however attention came and my ex's wife came to me saying that I was not invited and crashing the funeral so I must leave. Luckily my ex's older brother intervened and said that I was welcomed. The only problem is that after this he basically forced me to sit further in the front (literally put his arm around me and led me to the front despite me saying I was fine) to sit in the row reserved for family, directly behind my ex, his wife and their kids. While people were looking at the body (open casket) their kids saw me they came to hug me and noticed my stomach was big so asked if I was pregnant. Their mother butted in and made a snarky comment like \"yes darlings, she just can't stop making them\". Mind you I only have one other child so this comment was purely just to make me sound like some loose woman. But still, I bit my tongue. \n\nThe youngest then asked if the child will have my red hair and her mother scoffed and under her breath said something like God forbid.

Just accept it", "Yeah, you still were the side chick until the papers were signed.\n\nOh, wait...", "You slept with a married man. That is the definition of a side chick.", "Affair:\na sexual relationship between two people, one or both of whom are married to someone else.", "Op clearly went to rub the pregnancy in the wife\u2019s face like she knew her being there would start something", "This filled with just assumptions from the north pole. So much for hard truth. \n\nLegally they were married so it can legally be considered an affair. Reality is they were separated adults living separate lives awaiting divorce.\n\nAnd I was *dating* their father. It wasn't some undercover relationship. I'd met his kids and they knew we were in a relationship whilst we were dating.", "You are stupid. Please don't breed we don't need your genes being spread around. My parents have been separated for 10+ years yet are still legally married. Does that make every person they dated a side chick/ man?", "She might hate me but not even she would call our relationship an affair. Legally you can consider it as that but you know (and you know) that the connotations of side chick and affair suggest that he was sleeping around with me while also being a part of a romantic relationship with his wife who was oblivious to that.", "Ok legally but even the wife did not consider it an affair", "Yeah. I'm with the OP here. Lots of people date when they're only separated. That's the whole point of separation. No need to call her names or judge her for that. If you want to judge anyone for that, judge the ex. He's the one who was technically still married and out dating.\n\nAll of that said, I'm with a lot of the commenters here on ESH. The ex for getting you all into this, the mom for being an absolute cornhole, and the OP for not just saying \"maybe! We'll have to wait and see!\" And instead giving kids way too much information that will only confuse them. I see no reason with just showing up at the funeral and sitting in the back, though. But you definitely crossed a line and created drama with your response.", "\"My ex's mother and I were very close. I knew her from long before I started seeing her son. I saw her as my own mother. We kept close contact up until the end.\"\n\nAnd you jumped on his break up with his wife and saw no possibility of them getting back together...", "Until that divorce was finalized you were still a side chick YTA there was no reason for you to go to that funeral to start unnecessary drama", "i really hate to tell you this but he left you as soon as things with his wife were fixed again. he never had any intention of building a life with you no matter what he may have told you. you were a rebound, a way to pass time, or a side chick. you also made the decision to sleep with a married man (even if he was \u201cseparated\u201d) because the divorce wasn\u2019t finalized. you took that gamble. his wife is angry he sought comfort in another woman while they weren\u2019t together but kind of were. she\u2019s blaming you for that. now you involved her children into this mess so now you\u2019ve almost justified her anger since you\u2019ve become somewhat of a home wrecker.", "He was sleeping around with you while also being part of a seriously dysfunctional romantic relationship with many unresolved issues. \n\nHe found comfort (and unprotected sex) in your arms before having sorted out his relationship, which resumed amidst or despite the complications of your existence in his life. \n\nYeah, that's a side chick. And an affair.", "I think what's moving me towards OP being an all-time AH on this one (despite my ESH judgy-ness) is the pre-existing relationships. Long-time with his mother, multiple times with the ex. I can't fathom how she could be ignorant of the ex's attachment to his wife given these things, and wonder if the re-attachment to him wasn't purposeful in a time of difficulty for him. OP doesn't inspire trust, IMO.", "I separated from my husband, got a restraining order and moved away. The divorce took a little over two years because he had to be served and didn\u2019t have an address - it was finalized when he went to prison and I finally knew where tf he was. I started dating my now long term bf during those two years - I guess I should go tell him according to Reddit he\u2019s a side ho lmao", "To be clear, I really don't mind the judgment of asshole or not asshole and I don't want this to be perceived as me arguing with a judgment.\n\nThe problem is that you and others instead of asking questions or something you've created this whole narrative and story making it seem like his wife was some poor woman alone in her home hoping to reconcile with her husband or something and I just don't get it. No. They were separated. When we started dating it had already been 10 months of separation and we dated for a year after that. During that whole time she also was having her own relationships. Their relationship was over. Both were living like singles.\n\nAnd the reason they even tried again to reconcile was because she was planning on moving back home (different country) after the divorce was eventually finalised and he didn't want to be away from his kids so I backed off and they gave it another shot. I'm not even trying to say they don't have love between them because they obviously married for a reason but this narrative of me being some side chick rebound while they planned to reconcile couldn't be further from the truth.", "Where is all the anger for the dude here?? He's the one who slept with someone else when he was separated. He had sex with the OP, got her pregnant, and left her to go back to the wife. The OP didn't wreck any homes, her ex did. Smells like Misogyny to me.", "Dude. You need to chill. \n\nPlenty of relationships with two fully single people fall into all the categories you describe\u2014that doesn\u2019t make them affairs. \n\nThis man was dating OP out in the open with the knowledge of his children and family.  By definition she\u2019s not the affair partner or the side chick.", "I don't have a problem with you calling me TA. Just wanted to get that away.\n\nBut with your logic, even a polygamous relationship would is an affair because its an extramarital activity. And logical person wouldn't call it that though because the clear connotation (and in some definitions) is that one of the parties isn't aware or wouldn't agree with that extramarital relationship.\n\nThey broke up, separated and lived separate lives. Calling me a side chick is just mischaracterisation with the context but I guess you can just ignore that and keep it at I'm slept with a married man regardless of the disingenuous nature.", "Sounds familiar OP?\ud83d\ude02", "I can't not call the mom of the kids an asshole for being rude in the first place. And the Ex. I'm trying to find someone in this situation who doesn't suck. The kids are fine. Seem like just kids. Ex's bro should have asked if she wanted to sit up front rather than just bringing her up here.....yeah, everyone here still sucks.", "i never said the wife was a poor women who still loved her husband. you\u2019ve got me wrong. i came at it from a legal standpoint. whether we like it or not LEGALLY the man committed adultry. he was married. it\u2019s his fault. but OP knew he was still married and instead of waiting to pursue a relationship until everything is finalized she went for it AND THEN INVOLVED HIS CHILDREN. that is my biggest issue with OP.", "bro \ud83d\ude2d she told his children they have a sibling on the way, she wrecked their home by making their view of their father skewed at such a young age. i got angry at the father in my original response but OP feels like she\u2019s not done anything wrong here. i\u2019m a woman i feel bad for women who get abandoned after falling pregnant but it takes two to tango and it is her responsibility too. i never fully blamed her i\u2019m just trying to make her realize she involved young children into this and took the gamble of sleeping with a man who was still married.", "explained this later in the thread, this was me poorly communicating that the father was wrong and used OP and then went back to his wife. i was trying to make OP realize she was wronged in that way. my biggest issue with OP is that she involved the children in this mess and did it at a funeral. there was a better time to do that and she should\u2019ve told their father she was pregnant before talking to them. ESH.", "It's disingenuous as well to compare your situation to a poly relationship. You're looking for reasons to not be TA while professing to be okay with judgement.", "Polygamy is not legally recognized however most people have no problem with it if all parties are on the same page about it.\n\nThat's not what happened here. They were separated not divorced. You were a rebound to fool around with and get his dick wet while they worked it out or did divorce.", "Basically, the kids are innocent, and the dead mother. \n\nThat's about it.", "You're speaking to OP btw.\n\n>i really hate to tell you this but **he left you as soon as things with his wife were fixed again. he never had any intention of building a life with you no matter what he may have told you. you were a rebound, a way to pass time, or a side chick**\n\n>his wife is angry *he sought comfort in another woman while they weren\u2019t together but kind of were*.\n\n>since you\u2019ve become somewhat of a **home wrecker**\n\nAnd this is what I was referring to. I don't think it's quite honest to say you were speaking from only a legal standpoint when you quite literally said I was a homewrecker that he just sought momentary comfort in until he got the chance to reconcile with his partner. This is what I have a problem with because it's just false because you're very clearly not just speaking legally. \n\nEven legal aspect is such a strange support your using. There's no grown adult who would refer to a relationship during a divorce as adultery except for those in acrimonious parting who want to use it for the proceedings. Not two people who split, lived separate lives and got into separate relationships while getting their divorce finalised.", "He was separated from his wife at the time! The kids knew about the relationship! I don't disagree that telling the kids their dad was the baby's father was the worst idea, and I think she knows that. But if anyone wrecked that home it's dad. If it wasnt the OP, it would have been a different girl. If dad had used birth control, there wouldn't have been a baby. Dad knew he got the OP pregnant, and kept it under wraps. He is every bit as at fault as she is. No, actually, he's more culpable. Because if anyone cheated, he did. His chickens came home to roost and he wasn't ready.", "and i think what\u2019s truly misogynistic is tip toeing around women and pretending they\u2019re these helpless things that got left behind when men leave them and they\u2019re too pure to have done anything wrong. don\u2019t use misogyny as an excuse to not hold women accountable. she\u2019s not a pure child who didn\u2019t know any better, she\u2019s a woman, a human being. humans fuck up.", "I mean, the wife knew they were dating. She was too. OP already knew the kids and they also knew their parents split and their dad was dating OP. I do think all the side chick and homewrecker talk is unfair and from the story really not the case.\n\nThat said, I do think talking about the details of the pregnancy to the kids before their dad- while at a funeral- was inappropriate.\n\nGoing a bit against the grain with ESH.\n\nOP didn\u2019t know the funeral was invitation only. Maybe this is location based, but around where I live such a thing is extremely rare. Most funerals the dates and locations are announced, with a welcome to anyone who know and wanted to mourn or celebrate the life of the departed. And if she was that close to her exes mother, I think she deserved to be there. Maybe a mistake due to lack of invitation, but I think it was an innocent mistake where they aren\u2019t an AH and they should not have been immediately angry and respected her relationship with the departed. \n\nAlso the wife was being a bitch, though people don\u2019t typically like their partners ex so ok whatever. OP took it even tho it was rude.\n\nBut yeah, inappropriate time, way, and place to announce you\u2019re pregnant with his child.", "Note i haven't commented on a single person who said i was an asshole for telling the kids. That's what I'm asking for. That's not what you're doing though.\n\n\nI'm correcting you purposefully ignoring context to push a narrative. How is my situation different from a poly relationship from a legal standpoint? That's where you're coming from right when you call me a side chick and our relationship and affair? The standpoint I was sleeping with a married man and to hell with the context. Why wouldn't that apply to a poly relationship? Again, to hell with its context.", "Lol so polygamy is also adultery? If you're the third, fourth, etc person then you're just engaging in an affair?\n\nAll parties were on the same page with the separation and process of divorcing. All parties had no problem with relationship during that time. Explain again why its different?", "All parties were on the same page with OP and their ex\u2019s relationship though. OP, ex, his wife, his kids. Everyone was aware of and had no issue with the relationship. Most couples date while divorces finalize. The wife was dating as well. All parties were aware and consenting to OPs relationship"]}
