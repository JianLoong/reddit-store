I called and informed her that I would be taking the kids back to my house where she could pick them up when she was ready. Immediately after she hung up, her mother walked out to see why we weren't coming inside - I can only assume she texted her mother as we were talking and asked her to go outside.

They explain that they don't like going to bed without her as they feel unsafe and scared. \n\nThe affect its having on the kids has driven me to a point to have to find a way to have her abide by the agreement as best I can by taking the kids back to my home when she is not present at drop-off.", "created_utc": 1700249887, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xn4ro/aita_for_refusing_to_leave_my_children_with_my/", "score": 829, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In no way do I say she can't spend her time how she'd like, but when it affects the children to the point that they speak up to me about it, I have an issue with it because it's now affecting the children. \n\nDue to character limits I was unable to provide a lot of details which is unfortunate because I believe those would have painted a better picture of how she was when we were still married. That is what it is, but the biggest downfall was her lack of communication, as seen here, she fails to communicate that she will not be there at drop off, so I drive 15 minutes to her home, to have to explain to my kids why she's not there. I would much rather have those extra 15 minutes with them still at my home and let my ex pick them up, but she refuses to do so. \n\nMy concern is that there is a court order she is not abiding by, and I am wanting to change the pattern of behavior to reflect the court ordered agreement otherwise I feel the need to have the courts intervene to get a different parenting plan in place.

It also seems that the fact that your wife is coming home late seems to enrage you.  Again, OP you are divorced and your exwife's coming and goings are not any of your concern.  There is an adult in the house to supervise and care for the children.  I seriously doubt that your wife is out carousing every single evening.  She may occasionally go out to eat with friends or go shopping or many other activities - again, not your concern OP.\n\nYou also seem to feel that the children should be in either your care or your wife's care when they come home from school.

So when you two divorced, your ex assumed that she would be the person at home to get the kids. That\u2019s changed. And given that her mom is a caregiver you approve of, it\u2019s not a significant one. Also it requires nothing additional from you.

In an ideal world yes you two should be able to figure it out, and put the children\u2019s wants and needs first. She\u2019s shown time after time that she\u2019s entirely incapable of doing so. She only prioritizes herself, and the kids are only a priority so far as it doesn\u2019t interfere with what she personally wants for herself. If you two could have worked this out, you would have by now. People like this only listen to or respect an authority above them. In this case a judge, if you don\u2019t have the money now start saving up every dime. Document every single interaction so you have a record, it would also be a smart idea to get the kids into therapy, in general because they probably need it after the change; but also because it\u2019s the therapists opinion that\u2019s going to carry some weight in court. It\u2019s best they\u2019ve seen the child long enough to see the negative effects her lifestyle has had on them. The kids own opinions go a long way too, especially if they\u2019re over the age of 12. If not, the therapist is the best course of action. \n\nI\u2019m not saying take full custody (unless you want to) but having it documented that she\u2019s not spending that much time with them, they\u2019re in her mothers care more than agreed upon, and the kids aren\u2019t comfortable with that arrangement would be enough to force change. For example you could find a seperate 3rd party babysitter or daycare that\u2019s not connected to either of you to take that out of the equation. You could have her custody reduced to weekend so they\u2019re with one of their actual parents the majority of the time. Hell even if you want none of that, just going before a judge could be enough to force her to stick to the actual pre made custody agreement. You have nothing to lose and you and your children have everything to gain by taking this to court.", "YTA. You're still trying to control your ex-wife (wonder why the divorce happened).

If I may offer an alternative opinion- It seems to me you might have the opportunity to fix a couple problems here at once.\n\nIf you approach your ex-wife about this in a confrontational way, she is going to be confrontational back. Since you are not financially in a situation to go back to court right now anyway, I would strongly advise trying to have a sincere and UNDERSTANDING conversation about this with her instead. I don\u2019t know if your ex is getting annoyed by this because she doesn\u2019t want you to have that extra time with the kids, or if she is just feeling like you are inserting yourself in her life by demanding answers about how she handles her parenting time.

You guys got divorced, she doesn\u2019t want to feel like she has to run her life by you.\n\nMaybe she is working more to make extra money, or maybe she just wants to have a more active social life. Either way, she might actually appreciate you taking on more parenting time so she can live whatever part of her life she is living without being responsible for the kids at the same time. If you approach this by being honest that you wish you had more time with the kids, and that you realize it is not your business what she\u2019s doing in her private life, you could try and arrange an unofficial right of first refusal. Propose that if she can\u2019t be home for all of her scheduled time, tell her that you\u2019d love to keep the kids longer so you have more time with them, and she can be free to do whatever she needs to do, and bonus, her mom gets a break as well.\n\nAll she has to do is tell you to keep the kids that night or whatever, you won\u2019t ask why, and you\u2019ll drop the kids off when she gets home. No bickering, just mutual benefit. You have the opportunity to potentially solve the problem of your kids being left alone without their mom, give you more time with the kids, give your ex a little more breathing room, and it could help you to finally open up the lines of communication that have been lacking in your co-parenting thus far. It might work, and you can wait until you are more stable to formalize it in your agreement with the court, and hopefully do so with her agreement, instead of a fight. Either way, I hope it works out for you and your kids.", "So if this is not something you\u2019re familiar with (copy and pasted from my response to another commenter) \u201cit\u2019s pretty common for custody agreements to have a right of first refusal- where if the parent cannot be with the children during their scheduled custody time, they must offer that time to the other parent to take the children. Basically if you aren\u2019t able to be with the kids during your time, you have to offer to let their other parent watch them before/instead of hiring a babysitter. So any time outside of the 2:30-5:30 window that they agreed to pay OP\u2019s MIL, if OP\u2019s ex is not actually with the kids, he would be completely within his rights to have them remain with him.\u201d", "I guarantee the ex wife is working a whole lot more since she is now a single mother, and that's probably why she is absent.

Or like I did working a second job as a waitress from 5pm until 2am(when the bar closed) idk something about OP rubs me the wrong way...\ud83e\udd14", "I'm not wanting her removed, I just want more time with my kids. I don't believe I said anywhere I want to take the kids away from her.", "Actually, when it is her parenting time, she is allowed to get a sitter as frequently as she likes. It\u2019s none of his business, unless she leaves the kids unattended or with inadequate supervision. Since he pays her mom to watch the kids, he really has no argument to make that she isn\u2019t fit to watch the kids.", "The thing is OP keeps going on about her abusing her mother as a caretaker, this seems really suspicious and not like a real reason. I really doubt he is that passionate about his MIL being taken advantage of, so to me it brings into question what the real reasons are. The kids being alone might be it... but how often is that actually happening? Is there a reason that isn't the main reason OP is pushing because it should be but it feels added on. I think its not unreasonable to suspect he might dislike how his ex is spending her time and doesn't wanna harp on the reason that's too close\n\nThat said I'm not gonna say this confidently, I dont like people being reddit detectives that jump to wild conclusions, but I will confidently state there's something that feels wrong about his passion for his MIL not being taken advantage of when it doesn't sound like she's complained about it at all", "His intentions are controlling and disingenuous", "You continue to sound controlling, petty, and jealous\u2014 and mostly like you want to dictate how your ex parents when you aren\u2019t around. Your kids are with their grandmother. They\u2019re safe. Maybe focus on maximizing the quality of time you spend with your kids, rather than getting into your ex\u2019s lane.", "My warehouse has a 7pm-5am shift. She could have a second job working an overnight to make ends meet. Like the other commenter said. Get home in the early morning hours and passing out just to go back to original job at 9am.", "Second jobs exist", "I'm talking about the bullshit provision you're using to try to force her to see you several times a week.  That is not standard, is a red flag, and needs to be removed.  You should probably seek some counseling to come to terms with the fact that she's no longer your wife.  Your kids are perfectly fine.  You are stirring up trouble for no reason and using kids as pawns.", "There it is. The truth.", "More time takes away from her time \n\nSo that's what you'll be doing in effect", "I grew up with a mom who abused her mom as a caretaker. My grandmother had a bad hip, heart condition and was in no shape to run after small children, and my mom would emotionally manipulate her into babysitting my active little siblings. She did the same to me. Tears, anger, telling the kids we didn\u2019t love them anymore if we said no. Grandma never complained. I did. \n\nOPs ex MIL is living with her daughter and is dependent on her. Try saying no then.", "It\u2019s a pretty common thing in many many custody agreements. It\u2019s even common in situations where the father has abused the mother or vice verso, forcing a domestic abuse/violence survivor to see their abuser at every pick up and drop off. \n\nI have even seen one case where the mother documented every drop off/pick up by video because the father would threaten to hurt/kill her Every. Single. Time. in front of the POLICE STATION the mother chose as the drop off/pick up location because she was so terrified if that man. \n\nIt\u2019s often not a decision made by the parents themselves, but by the judge presiding over their case.", "That\u2019s actually a pretty common provision. I\u2019ve heard the lawyer from Modern Divorce discuss it several times.", "This is a stretch... He says his kids are sad they don't get to see their mom. He doesn't have a custody agreement with Grandma.", "Judges don\u2019t rule on these unless the divorce is contested and goes to trial. Most divorces are handled by lawyers outside of court. My guess is if it was a forced provision then it was a contested divorce"]}
