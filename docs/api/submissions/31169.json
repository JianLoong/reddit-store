At times she will not answer my call to see when she may be home (i.e. are you 5 minutes away, or an hour away?)

I called and informed her that I would be taking the kids back to my house where she could pick them up when she was ready. Immediately after she hung up, her mother walked out to see why we weren't coming inside - I can only assume she texted her mother as we were talking and asked her to go outside.

They explain that they don't like going to bed without her as they feel unsafe and scared. \n\nThe affect its having on the kids has driven me to a point to have to find a way to have her abide by the agreement as best I can by taking the kids back to my home when she is not present at drop-off.", "created_utc": 1700249887, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xn4ro/aita_for_refusing_to_leave_my_children_with_my/", "score": 353, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In no way do I say she can't spend her time how she'd like, but when it affects the children to the point that they speak up to me about it, I have an issue with it because it's now affecting the children. \n\nDue to character limits I was unable to provide a lot of details which is unfortunate because I believe those would have painted a better picture of how she was when we were still married. That is what it is, but the biggest downfall was her lack of communication, as seen here, she fails to communicate that she will not be there at drop off, so I drive 15 minutes to her home, to have to explain to my kids why she's not there. I would much rather have those extra 15 minutes with them still at my home and let my ex pick them up, but she refuses to do so. \n\nMy concern is that there is a court order she is not abiding by, and I am wanting to change the pattern of behavior to reflect the court ordered agreement otherwise I feel the need to have the courts intervene to get a different parenting plan in place.

I also don't believe that the kids are expressing to you that they feel \"unsafe\" and \"scared\" - seems like you might be coaching them to say these things.  It also seems that the fact that your wife is coming home late seems to enrage you.  Again, OP you are divorced and your exwife's coming and goings are not any of your concern.  There is an adult in the house to supervise and care for the children.  I seriously doubt that your wife is out carousing every single evening.  She may occasionally go out to eat with friends or go shopping or many other activities - again, not your concern OP.\n\nYou also seem to feel that the children should be in either your care or your wife's care when they come home from school.

So when you two divorced, your ex assumed that she would be the person at home to get the kids. That\u2019s changed. And given that her mom is a caregiver you approve of, it\u2019s not a significant one. Also it requires nothing additional from you. Pointing to the fine print of the custody agreement isn\u2019t really going to cut it\u2026unless you want to waste more resources to appear in court.\n\nStop trying to control your ex.

It is literally your wife's visitation time. She should be picking them up.

In an ideal world yes you two should be able to figure it out, and put the children\u2019s wants and needs first. She\u2019s shown time after time that she\u2019s entirely incapable of doing so. She only prioritizes herself, and the kids are only a priority so far as it doesn\u2019t interfere with what she personally wants for herself. If you two could have worked this out, you would have by now. People like this only listen to or respect an authority above them. In this case a judge, if you don\u2019t have the money now start saving up every dime. Document every single interaction so you have a record, it would also be a smart idea to get the kids into therapy, in general because they probably need it after the change; but also because it\u2019s the therapists opinion that\u2019s going to carry some weight in court. It\u2019s best they\u2019ve seen the child long enough to see the negative effects her lifestyle has had on them. The kids own opinions go a long way too, especially if they\u2019re over the age of 12. If not, the therapist is the best course of action. \n\nI\u2019m not saying take full custody (unless you want to) but having it documented that she\u2019s not spending that much time with them, they\u2019re in her mothers care more than agreed upon, and the kids aren\u2019t comfortable with that arrangement would be enough to force change. For example you could find a seperate 3rd party babysitter or daycare that\u2019s not connected to either of you to take that out of the equation. You could have her custody reduced to weekend so they\u2019re with one of their actual parents the majority of the time. Hell even if you want none of that, just going before a judge could be enough to force her to stick to the actual pre made custody agreement. You have nothing to lose and you and your children have everything to gain by taking this to court.", "YTA. You're still trying to control your ex-wife (wonder why the divorce happened).

In January 2022 she landed a job and was no long home to get the children after school.\n\nFrom may 2019 -november 2022 her Sister lived with us/her and when her sister moved out, the Mother moved in. Once her mother moved in, she began to be absent at drop-offs and I made a point to bring it up to her that the agreement stated we both must be present. \n\nOur children express their sadness and concern that their mother is not home until after they are asleep \"Nonna put us to bed last night and we were scared/couldnt sleep\" or \"mommy woke me up this morning when she got home\" - it's the affect on my kids that I'm trying to address with my actions. \n\nThis is not an attempt to control her, this is an attempt to hold her accountable for the care of the children. She signed the same agreement that I did, yet she is not holding up her end. I have taken her to court in the past to modify the agreement and got the necessary changes made, and I will likely have to do so again, in the meantime this is my attempt to correct the issue before, or and hopefully to prevent, a court from being involved.", "They live together!

When she isn't there, her mother is 99% of the time. So she has me leave them with her - which I don't agree with as she is not responsible for them at that time, in the sense that she did not birth those children and should not be burdened by them being forced into her care. She loves them and would never complain, I just don't feel it's right and I feel my ex is abusing the fact that her mom lives in her home. \n\n3) she argues that we pay her for childcare. We pay her for after-school care in lieu of having them in the ASP program at school. At 530 when we get off work, one or us should be there to get the children from out of her care. \n\n4) I will be going for a 50/50 custody to have more time with the kids. They have already began coming to my house on Fridays instead or Saturdays to spend extra nights with me. \n\nI can't keep the children full time without a court telling her I can, she would get the police involved if I attempted to so without an agreement being made, and she refuses to have that communication to open that discussion currently. \n\nHope this helps clear the confusion - I appreciate your feedback", "I have not looked into a PI/Detective but may be worth looking into for future custody discussions/litigations.

I believe this codependency is part of their issue with her not being there, it's not their norm so they feel the need to express that.

These clauses are pretty standard and essentially say \"if you need a babysitter, you need to first ask the other parent if they want to do it\". If there is such a clause, you send her an official communication (email is fine) telling her she has violated that clause on multiple occasions, ideally with exact dates, and reminding her of her obligations, with a threat to escalate as needed. \n\nIf there is no such clause, you can still tell her that her parenting time will not begin if she's not available to parent the kids. You can rely on the clause that says she needs to be present at drop offs, but make it clear this is about the actual custody time, which is meant for her, not her mother. If she doesn't cooperate, you have the option to just do like you plan and take the kids to your house until she picks them up. If she disagrees, she can try taking you to court so make sure you document each time that it happens. No lawyer will tell her that going to court is a good idea. You can also decide to attempt to go back to mediation to amend the agreement to include detailed right of first refusal modalities or even go to court to have it added or enforced. \n\nNTA but please learn to focus on the important facts and ignore the irrelevant ones.
