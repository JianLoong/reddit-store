But I did not put on false eyelashes because they\u2019re just uncomfortable for me and I figured that it\u2019s just family, so it doesn\u2019t matter. Now for further context into this, I have trichotillomania, which means that I compulsively pull out my hair. In my case, I mainly pull out my eyelashes. But at this point I have gotten better at trying to stop and my eyelashes are starting to grow back in a bit, so I decided to just put on mascara. And so we went to dinner and ate, but when we got back home, my father was extremely upset and said that I embarrassed him by not wearing any false eyelashes. My mother agreed with him and said that I should\u2019ve listened and put more effort into my looks. But I don\u2019t think that it was wrong for me to have not worn fake eyelashes.
