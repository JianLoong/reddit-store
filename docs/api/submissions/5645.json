Yesterday on Christmas Eve when my mother was assigning seating for Christmas dinner she told me I have to sit at the children table since the adult table is only for married couples who have children. I was taken aback by her comment since she knows my husband and I are struggling to get pregnant because I have PCOS. I told my mom her expectations where unfair and that I was hurt by her comment. She told me to stop being sensitive and help out. I\u2019m super pissed and tired of being treated like a child by her.

They have completely disrespected you.  You are an adult.  If they are not going to treat you with respect, then you don\u2019t need to grace the, with your presence.

Time to go low contact with them and do not worry about flying in next year for the holidays because they have no intention of treating you as an equal until you have a child.
