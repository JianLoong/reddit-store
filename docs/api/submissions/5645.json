She told me to stop being sensitive and help out. I\u2019m super pissed and tired of being treated like a child by her.

Time to go low contact with them and do not worry about flying in next year for the holidays because they have no intention of treating you as an equal until you have a child.

Plan your own happy xmas with people who are rooting for you, even if initially that's just your spouse. \n\nPeople who rely on passive-aggressiveness instead of working to air out conflict tend to not be great listeners. But I still think you should kindly, gently tell your mom that she has hurt your feelings by not being compassionate about your challenges to conceive, and that her treating you as a child because you're not a parent yet is demeaning and unkind.

End result is the same, even if mom isn\u2019t explicitly saying, that never happened, I never said that.   \n\n\nMom is being shitty, regardless.
