My husband (24m) unfortunately couldn\u2019t be with me due to not being able to get time off work. My mom has been driving me crazy with her passive aggressive comments. My husband and I have been married for about a year, we didn\u2019t visit my parents last year for Christmas. Anyway, I flew home early this week. I\u2019ve been helping my parents set up their Christmas decorations. Yesterday on Christmas Eve when my mother was assigning seating for Christmas dinner she told me I have to sit at the children table since the adult table is only for married couples who have children. I was taken aback by her comment since she knows my husband and I are struggling to get pregnant because I have PCOS. I told my mom her expectations where unfair and that I was hurt by her comment. She told me to stop being sensitive and help out. I\u2019m super pissed and tired of being treated like a child by her. I\u2019m contemplating flying home early but unfortunately all flights are booked so I\u2019m stuck with my parents till Tuesday morning. Although am I being unreasonable for wanting to sit at the adults table? \n\nSome contexts about my family, my parents are super religious. I\u2019ve been told that only married people can sit at the adults table.\n\nUpdate \nWow I didn\u2019t expect so many to comment. Thank you to everyone that responded, I took the opportunity to talk to my mom after dinner and explained that her comment hurt and that it wasn\u2019t fair to separate me from the adults just for not having children. Her comment caught me off guard because she has been my biggest supporter in my infertility journey. After I explained myself my mom realize that her comment was out of line and she was sorry for taking her frustration out on me. She was stressed about my autistic brothers behavior since he was throwing a temper tantrum about not being at the adult table as well. \n\nOverall I had a heart to heart with my mom and she was extremely sorry for her insensitive remark. She knows that she was out of line and shouldn\u2019t have said something so hurtful to me. I forgave my mom because I understand that we are human and that we say dumb things when we are stressed. I honestly was crying when I first wrote this report because I missed my husband and dealing with my family is exhausting. This is why I chose to attend school out of state but definitely learned to not attend family gatherings without my husband.", "created_utc": 1672001789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv6hq7/aita_for_wanting_to_sit_at_the_adult_table_for/", "score": 456, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
