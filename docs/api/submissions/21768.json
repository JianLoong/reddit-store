Enjoy your peace.", "NTA. Why in the hell is your dad dating his cousin? Unless your last name is Clampett or Lannister, there is no way this is a good thing.", "INFO, I can't make a judgement without knowing what he said but I think more so NTA because at the end of the day, you get to decide who sees you and who sees your kids, and an explanation isn't even necessary.", "NTA\n\nYeah, that\u2019s some gross stuff\u2026", "NTA- for him to even remotely think it\u2019s ok to date and procreate with a family member is disgusting. Sounds like he has some real issues and I wouldn\u2019t want that around my kids either.", "NTA at all dude. your dad is seriously messed up for dating his own cousin and then proceeding to have an argument with you about it and shame you for having a different opinion here. you took the high road and let him deal with his life even though he is committing incest but he came after you for no reason. i suggest just get away from him and leave him with his problems because nobody needs that negative energy in their life :)", "NTA. If you feel uncomfortable with the way your father, or anyone else, conducts their life you have every right to limit you contact with them and by extension, your children\u2019s contact with them. Just out of curiosity is this a first or second cousin and how old is she? Most states have laws regarding marriage to relatives, primarily to prevent potential health issues the children of such unions may suffer from.", "NTA - idk what country you are in , but is incest not illegal ???", "\"If parents are blood relatives, for example, first cousins, the risk of having children with diseases and birth defects is twice as high as when the parents are not related.\"\n\nFrom https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.helsenorge.no/492f28/globalassets/dokumenter/having-children-when-the-parents-are-blood-relatives.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiZ1o3Tj4KAAxUgGTQIHUSMAikQFnoECBEQBg&usg=AOvVaw22E4M6VqPsAsuWCtsVSB05\n\nNTA, you don't say where you live or if they plan to marry. I know laws against 1st cousins marrying are not uncommon. I would send them *both* articles such as this one about the increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and genetic defects if the parents are first cousins. This is just in case she isn't aware of the risks she would be taking with her potential children's lives. After that, I'd simply wash my hands of the whole thing. Sounds like your father isn't worth staying in contact with anyway.", "In all honesty nta if you feel the need to go no contact. That\u2019s your choice. A lot of people don\u2019t understand why someone goes no contact in a family unless they have the full info. But seriously dad dating a cousin when they won\u2019t be having kids at 55-60 yo isn\u2019t a huge deal. Morally questionable? Sure. But if they aren\u2019t having kids it literally only affects them. So I\u2019m not even sure what this post is about lol.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
