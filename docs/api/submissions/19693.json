I have no problem with her seeing her family, but I do have a problem with the fact they constantly smoke in the house around my girlfriend. They smoke both cannabis and normal cigarettes in their house, and a few times when she has returned home after visiting her parents, her clothes and hair smell terribly strong of smoke and cannabis. \n\nI\u2019ve asked her about it a few times now and she explained how her parents smoke in the main room with all of the doors and windows closed, as their neighbours have complained about the smell. I explained how I don\u2019t agree with her going there if they smoke around her breathing it in as it can\u2019t be any good for her or our unborn baby. She said she would explain to her parents and ask them to smoke outside or at least open a door or window or something to let some fresh air indoors.\n\nShe went there 3 days ago, and again came home smelling of smoke. She said she asked her parents who refused. I said I simply don\u2019t want my girlfriend and baby going to her parents house unless they agree to stop smoking in the house with her there.

I would talk to the dr and her about it at the next Drs appt. Make it about the baby and not the parents and not going or not going.", "ESH for different reasons.\n\nI'm on to making baby #2. My partner has always gone to as many OB appointments as he can. The intake nurse and Dr. always ask about the mother's alcohol intake and smoke in the house. They do this because there's correlating evidence that those things lead to low birth weight and delays in fetal and infant development. Some people say there's not enough \"real evidence.\" No, you can't do a double blind scientific screening where you secretly test large groups of randomly selected pregnant women by knocking them all unconscious and administering masks to three groups: a group with regular air, a group with purified oxygen and a group with second hand tobacco/marijuana smoke, then track them and their children for the next 50 years with the women and children never knowing what group they were in. That's crazy unethical. So, correlation of self reported activity is the best evidence we can gather. How many women drink and lie to their doctors. How many don't smoke \"in the home\" but go to their chimney stack family's homes?\n\nGF is an AH because she is lying to her doctor about smoke exposure and not stepping up to protect her child. \n\nIn-laws (I know it's just a GF/BF relationship, but what else do you call them?) are AHs because everyone knows cigarette smoke is toxic and addicting and isn't good for children, infants, pregnant women, and... EVERYBODY, but adults at least make a \"choice\" to start and can \"choose\" to reduce or stop using. The least the in-laws could do is open some windows and not light up while she, and later the baby, are there.\n\nBF is an AH for not being a part of the Dr appointments so the medical staff is in the dark about what could be affecting the health of his child. He's an AH for not calmly talking to the in-laws directly about his concerns about smoke exposure leaving it to his vulnerable GF. NTA for having a clear boundary about things that can harm his kid, but AH for not clearly communicating what's up to everyone. \n\nWhen she's over at her parents house they are \"in power.\" It's their house and they rule. She loves them and wants to be part of her birth family and when she's alone with them she feels she has to go with whatever they decide. You, BF, need to help her be strong and defend her own child from a known danger. They tell her her worries are overblown and what they are doing is ok. She knows from her Dr that is not, but she has no backup because you and the Dr are not there. You are not there with the Dr and not with her parents. She's alone and vulnerable.\n\nApproach her with love. Understand that she needs family and belonging. Also give her the encouragement to be strong about what she knows is right. Go with her to her Dr and get info from her Dr that will help arm her against her family's dismissals. Go with her to have this talk with her parents, with the Dr info. If they still won't stop with you and the Dr and their daughter asking, compromise! Invite the in-laws to visit you as long as they smoke outside. Meet up at parks and restaurants where you aren't confined or where they cannot smoke. Explain you love your GF and want them involved, but you want your baby safe even more. You are not cutting them out of your child's life, you are cutting second hand smoke out of your child's life.", "Soft ESH. Her parents suck for smoking around her when she's pregnant. She sucks for not advocating for herself and her baby. You, most of all, suck because you've been predatory by seeking an extremely young woman when you've had much more life experience and she's college age. If she wants to keep the baby and such great. If she's happy cool, you're still gross for seeking a partner without a fully developed brain when you've had one for years. However isolating her from her parents in any way shape or form when they aren't abusive is horrendous. \n\nYou could argue that they meet in a park outdoors, or a cafe where everyone can have some tea or coffee and relax and chat. I'm a cannabis smoker myself and would never intentionally smoke around someone I knew was pregnant, it's especially bad that it's her parents. They can take an edible or something and go somewhere without second hand smoke.
