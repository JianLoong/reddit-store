I would talk to the dr and her about it at the next Drs appt. Make it about the baby and not the parents and not going or not going.", "ESH for different reasons.\n\nI'm on to making baby #2. My partner has always gone to as many OB appointments as he can. The intake nurse and Dr. always ask about the mother's alcohol intake and smoke in the house. They do this because there's correlating evidence that those things lead to low birth weight and delays in fetal and infant development. Some people say there's not enough \"real evidence.\" No, you can't do a double blind scientific screening where you secretly test large groups of randomly selected pregnant women by knocking them all unconscious and administering masks to three groups: a group with regular air, a group with purified oxygen and a group with second hand tobacco/marijuana smoke, then track them and their children for the next 50 years with the women and children never knowing what group they were in. That's crazy unethical. So, correlation of self reported activity is the best evidence we can gather. How many women drink and lie to their doctors. How many don't smoke \"in the home\" but go to their chimney stack family's homes?\n\nGF is an AH because she is lying to her doctor about smoke exposure and not stepping up to protect her child. \n\nIn-laws (I know it's just a GF/BF relationship, but what else do you call them?) are AHs because everyone knows cigarette smoke is toxic and addicting and isn't good for children, infants, pregnant women, and... EVERYBODY, but adults at least make a \"choice\" to start and can \"choose\" to reduce or stop using. The least the in-laws could do is open some windows and not light up while she, and later the baby, are there.\n\nBF is an AH for not being a part of the Dr appointments so the medical staff is in the dark about what could be affecting the health of his child. He's an AH for not calmly talking to the in-laws directly about his concerns about smoke exposure leaving it to his vulnerable GF. NTA for having a clear boundary about things that can harm his kid, but AH for not clearly communicating what's up to everyone. \n\nWhen she's over at her parents house they are \"in power.\" It's their house and they rule. She loves them and wants to be part of her birth family and when she's alone with them she feels she has to go with whatever they decide. You, BF, need to help her be strong and defend her own child from a known danger. They tell her her worries are overblown and what they are doing is ok. She knows from her Dr that is not, but she has no backup because you and the Dr are not there. You are not there with the Dr and not with her parents. She's alone and vulnerable.\n\nApproach her with love. Understand that she needs family and belonging. Also give her the encouragement to be strong about what she knows is right. Go with her to her Dr and get info from her Dr that will help arm her against her family's dismissals. Go with her to have this talk with her parents, with the Dr info. If they still won't stop with you and the Dr and their daughter asking, compromise! Invite the in-laws to visit you as long as they smoke outside. Meet up at parks and restaurants where you aren't confined or where they cannot smoke. Explain you love your GF and want them involved, but you want your baby safe even more. You are not cutting them out of your child's life, you are cutting second hand smoke out of your child's life.", "Soft ESH. Her parents suck for smoking around her when she's pregnant. She sucks for not advocating for herself and her baby. You, most of all, suck because you've been predatory by seeking an extremely young woman when you've had much more life experience and she's college age. If she wants to keep the baby and such great. If she's happy cool, you're still gross for seeking a partner without a fully developed brain when you've had one for years. However isolating her from her parents in any way shape or form when they aren't abusive is horrendous. \n\nYou could argue that they meet in a park outdoors, or a cafe where everyone can have some tea or coffee and relax and chat. I'm a cannabis smoker myself and would never intentionally smoke around someone I knew was pregnant, it's especially bad that it's her parents.

I have yet to see a child with any significant level of disability bc of that, even when the mother tested positive for very hard drugs/alcohol throughout her pregnancy. Not to say it can happen, it can and does, but people act like you\u2019re signing the baby\u2019s death warrant if you walk thru a cloud of smoke or have a cup of non decaf coffee. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve got clients who haven\u2019t been sober since 2008, and they\u2019ve got 5-6 kids who are all perfectly healthy. What actually fucks kids development up is not having adequate engagement and attention and care and stimulation in their first 5 years. That\u2019s almost certain to cause sever behavioral problems and significant developmental delays. Nearly every time. Worry about the kids who are already born, they\u2019re in much more danger than most fetuses, they\u2019re also aware of their situation and suffering bc of it, unlike a fetus. I wish more than anything that people would devote even a quarter of the concern and outrage they have about fetuses and what pregnant women do and direct that towards helping actual children who are actively suffering and whose futures are being ruined.", "OP should call the cops on her then and let them handle this.

Many foods and drink are completely off the table for health risks to the fetus.\n\nAnd most don't. I worked in an OB/GYN clinic for over 4 years and let me tell you that SO many women continue drinking caffeine, eating lunch meat, eating a ton of carbs, smoking, doing meth, etc etc while pregnant with a myriad of health concerns. The majority of babies turn out fine. The biggest risk for OPs baby is the mom testing positive for THC at birth and CPS getting involved to ensure the born baby isn't going to be in an environment where they will ingest the drugs themselves.  Telling your partner they cannot visit their family is a no-go. If you have significant problems with your partner's family, you should probably break up before getting them pregnant.

This is only a sliver of what life with this man is going to be like. \n\nMy baby was used to control me. My now exhusband forbid me from nursing our son. I was told when I could and couldn\u2019t see my parents because that his son too and when he gets off work we had better be home. He refused to help with our some from 6pm to 10am, he would go hide in the basement. No one was allowed to come over and help me with housework, the baby or my own self care. Next was financial abuse.

And, you're right, breaking up is going to do nothing... because OP will have even less influence over what his GF does if that happens... but, still, he doesn't get to control her actions. He doesn't get to tell her she cannot do things or that she has to do other things. He gets to express concerns. He gets to express opinions.

She had a miscarriage at 17 weeks and even though it was never definitively proven that her drug use directly caused the miscarriage, she was convicted of manslaughter. This was somebody who was in massive amounts of pain, and instead of receiving help she was thrown in jail. It really makes me sick, especially now that Roe is gone. \n\nTldr: Shame, judgment, and criminalization aren\u2019t effective ways of dealing with the problem.", "But my argument is that it isn\u2019t productive.

We have the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world by a mile, and for Black women it\u2019s more like ten miles. We supposedly care so much about the well-being of children except that having a baby costs thousands of dollars, we won\u2019t provide you with parental leave, and oh yeah we\u2019ll probably close your local maternity unit while we\u2019re at it because hahaha go fuck yourself, that\u2019s what you get for needing medicaid.

There is no consensus on how much or if light drinking during pregnancy is safe, or what the threshold might be. Studies are unable to find a link between light drinking and fetal harm, but know that heavy drinking definitely can do significant harm to a developing fetus. So researchers err on the side of caution and say, a bit disingenuously \u201cthere is no known safe amount of alcohol to drink during pregnancy.\u201d But if you dig into that, what they literally mean is they know there IS a safe amount, since studies repeatedly do not find a correlation between light drinking during pregnancy and negative pregnancy/developmental outcomes, even far into the future (one study looked at the cognition levels of 10 yr olds, another the behavior problems of elementary school kids). They just don\u2019t know exactly what it is bc it\u2019s insanely hard to ethically study this subject (you can\u2019t just tell pregnant mothers to drink x amount so you can see if it harms her baby or not).
