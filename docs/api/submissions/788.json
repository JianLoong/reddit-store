I rented a room for me near my university, just for emergencies if I don't want to drive back( probably more because I'm shitfaced but let's say emergencies).\n I have this room around 6 weeks now, but I am rarely there.\nLast week I wanted to go out in the evening so I wanted to park my car, but my spot was taken. I had to park on the street but saw the owner of the car exiting it the next day. When I asked him, he got defensive and said because I am rarely there, he can use the parking spot. I did not want to escalate this so I just told him to park his turd on his spot. Well I checked almost every day now and the car is still parked there. I also gave notice to the building manager, she told me she talked to him, but he didn't show any sign that he would stop parking there.\n\nYesterday, when I wanted to go out for Halloween, it was still there, so I parked my car in front of his. He really did not like that and because the both of us were pretty drunk, it got really heated. \n\nMy question is, would I be an asshole if I tow his car just outside the property and maybe have it put in an absolute no parking zone or have it block a street ?", "created_utc": 1667334197, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjk6rw/wibta_if_i_tow_a_guys_car_from_my_parking_spot/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You paid for the spot.\n\nWhat does building management say about his continued parking violation and what are they willing to do about it?", "NTA for having it towed. It's your spot whether you are there 24/7 or once a year.\n\nHowever, no tow company is going to purposely put the car in a no parking zone or across a street. Just call a tow company and have them remove his vehicle and move on.", "Just ask yourself three questions:\n\n1. Have you politly ask the guy to stop? Yes \n\n2. Have you ask building management to get him to stop? Yes \n\n3. Do you have the legal right to towe his car? Yes.\n\nNTA its fair game at this point", "NTA, you tried to be reasonable and neighborly, he proceeded to be a huge D-bag.  Tow drivers generally won't move a car to a different spot, unless it's your car or for the city to do work in that spot.  But, having to go fetch his car out of a tow yard, and that expense, may enlighten him to the consequences of parking in someone else's spot.", "NTA. Tell your landlord she should have it towed and if she refuses then do it yourself. The company will take it to their tow yard and he will have to go get it.", "NTA - what you need to do is take this up with the property management.  Only they can call a tow truck on private property.  You may live there but they own the property.  Remind them of the contract that you signed giving you that parking spot.  If they don't do anything about it, they are in breach.", "NTA \n\nYou've given him plenty of warning at this point to move it. He's the ass for not doing so.", "NTA. Tow that junker. If the parking lot has a towing company, ignore them. Find a towing service from the opposite sides of town and call them. Make this guy hunt down this car. Make him go to the opposite side of town to get it back.", "NTA at this point. It'd be shitty if it was the first time, or even the first week. I wouldnt even call if it was an occasional thing (less than 3 times a week). But that behavior is so blatant, disrespectful, and uncompromising. Tow his car, he had one million other chances to change his behavior.", "There might be legal issues here.   But, I would tow it to some legal parking place off the property.", "NTA. You already communicated with him and the office manager did the same. He still parks in your space despite the warnings. Screw him.", "Absolutely NTA know that you have spoken to the owner. I still would have said NTA anyway, everybody who drives knows the risk of parking their car in a spot that is not theirs - that risk is towing. It\u2019s legal, it\u2019s fair and that\u2019s why it exists.", "NTA for wanting to tow his car, and not for actually towing it (I would). \n\n\nIf you have it towed to an illegal spot (idk if that's possible or legal anyhow) you'd turn into the ass tho. Just tow it to an impound lot and then let it be. (Document these encounters and if the lot isn't camera covered be very attentive to any possible vandalism or crazyness; this guy isn't totally stable it seems like)", "NTA you're paying for that spot, no matter if you park there often or once in a year.", "NTA. Its a spot you pay for..& your property manager needs to step it up and handle it.", "NTA - I don\u2019t know the rules about towing, but this guy just can\u2019t decide to park because you\u2019re not there. Is he going to let himself and sleep on your bed because you\u2019re not using it? \n\nFollow up with management. They need to address this with them.", "NTA!!! It is YOUR spot, and he has no right to it even if you never, ever used it. Absolutely have him towed as soon as humanly possible. Some people have to fuck around to find out.", "NTA. But just let the towing company take it whereever. You told him not to, the manager told him not to, you told him what would happen. Tow it, and record what he says and does when he sees you again. He's most likely going to threaten you, and you can take that and show it to the manager of the apartments and threaten him with the police...and follow through on it too. Keep a camera pointed at your car because this sort of entitled AH will absolutely try and get even. He's counting on you to be scared of making him mad. Tow his car, record his actions, and when he damages your car, take him to court.", "NTA, the apartment manager should've towed after the first warning.", "NTA - if towing not an option, dismantle the car and move it piece by piece.", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t park there. He\u2019s acting like an entitled jerk. Tow his ass and maybe he\u2019ll learn a lesson.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut don't touch his car. Avoid the liability.  -- Call a pro, and HAVE it towed.", "NTA\n\nI'm petty AF and would drive by every day and have it towed, regardless of weather I needed the spot of not.", "NTA for towing the car *properly.* \n\nYou went through all the required steps by ensuring the spot is actually yours, making a kind request, and still observing the behavior. You may now tow the car as much as you like until the behavior stops. \n\nThere may be rules about where you can tow the car legally so consult a professional tow organization and have your documents in order to prove the spot is yours. YWBTA if you towed it to block the street- that\u2019s insane and impacts public safety! What if an ambulance needed to get through? Why impact other people who aren\u2019t a part of your problem with him? You also might be an asshole for having heated drunk arguments in public- just call the tow company next time.", "If the parking spot is a part of your rent for your room, it doesn\u2019t matter how often you\u2019re there, you would be NTA if you had his car towed. That is essentially your property for as long as you lease it. Tell him unless he wants to pay for the spot so you can pay the landlord, he needs to stay out of it or get towed.", "YWNBTA to have his car towed from your assigned space, once it\u2019s a legal tow. \n\nHowever, as others have pointed out, a tow truck is not going to leave it somewhere else, particularly in an illegal manner. \n\nAnd trying to do it yourself, could leave you open for legal issues.", "INFO: What authority do you have to have the car towed?  You can't just randomly tow people's cars. The building manager would have to have it towed. Also, no tow truck driver is going to just tow it into the street and leave it there.  And if you move it yourself, that's auto theft. You're dreaming.\n\nOther than that, NTA.  It's your space whether you use it or not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA.", "She said she wanted to have another talk with him. Also that he was kinda aggressive and made clear that he would not leave the spot.", "I agree, but in some countries, you cannot tow a car that's illegally parked on your spot. The council and the police will say that's private so it's not up to them. If that is the case, OP can contact a company that ensures parking tickets for private lands (Parking Charge Notices or PCN). \n\nI'm planning in doing that if my neighbour's clients keep parking in my spot. She's a nail technician working from home and somehow she seems to believe she's entitled to other people's spots.", "Yup. She's having another talk with him this week, if that does not help, he's getting it towed.", "It depends where they live and what the laws are as to who can call a tow truck. Not everyone lives with the same laws.", "Mh. Would be a shame if I used one from my home town.

Of course with the rule that he would remove it when I'm there.", "Think he is stable, just thinks he is something better because he has a Merc.", "It\u2019s not possible.

Apparently it\u2019s very hard to remove and the guy never parked in her spot again. Just a suggestion. I give bad advice, so take it at your own risk", "Very true.  Where I am, property managers would have the ability to tow or give the resident the tow company's number.  Some places they circle like carrion eaters, waiting for a bumper to be a hair over a line. Then they hook up and your car is gone.", "Good. He is being an AH", "Not a bad idea.", "Don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUSe one close by.", "NTA man, good luck", "If he attacked you then you should call the police.", "Just a regular tow is fine. And if you think he will be violent, keep a camera on your car and door. Carry pepper spray. Call the cops and your housing manager if he attacks you. Heck, you are fair to report that assault that he already committed", "If your apartment has a towing company with signs posted, call the number and tell them someone is in your spot. If they do not have a tow company, most tow drivers will not move a car you don't own. I really think you should press the point with management one more time, though. \n\nMy sister had this issue at her place so she starting putting those orange cones in the corners of her spot  She also cemented a \"No Parking\" sign in a cement block and put that in the center of her spot. Management took notice. They started giving out warnings for the first offense, fines for the second and towing after that. The parking spots had the unit numbers stenciled, so it was obvious who the spot belonged to.", "Happy Halloween!", "I agree. There is duck around and find out. And then there is reciprocal AH. He will be mad but you\u2019re in your right to tow him out of your parking spot. But what\u2019s not ok? To tow him 50km away, to dump his car into the middle of an intersection, to have the tow truck drop it off in a lake. It might be tempting but you may be liable", "The house where my flat or room is, is brand new, the first people moved in there in March. The manager said, that she will have signs with the number plates put up. But this has not happened yet.", "Press the point with her again. You are paying for the room/flat and the parking and you should have access to it when you want.  Ask her if the complex has a towing company on retainer. I don't care if you don't go to the room for a month, no one should be in your spot.", "NTA\nBut I'm really here to beg you to update us when you have it towed. We have no lives and really want to know how this pans out.", "NTA[.](https://Esh.You)You asked politely, he impolitely [declined.

Tow it", "NTA, If you have a reserved parking spot, it is you and only you.  Any other vehicles that park in your spot should be subject to towing.

Having it towed, however-is legal.", "Totally agree to this!!! But sounds like he might be vindictive and target your car. So you may want to get a camera installed monitoring your car.", "Sure", "He has his own spot? I'm so confused", "The person who calls for a tow of an illegally parked car has no say in where that car goes. Most likely it will be taken to the tow company's own facility or an overflow lot where the tow company leases space. After a short period of time they are allowed to start charging storage fees in addition to the cost of the tow."]}
