Leah likes to play \u201cpranks\u201d on me where she tells me I did something wrong, or if I ask for something she refuses. I have never been good at social cues, so I have fallen for these pranks every time until very recently. For example, a few months ago I had to close the bank with a floater, because both Leah and Cathy had to leave early, which was something I had never done before. When I came in the next day she told me I had left the vault door open and that some supervisors from the main branch were going to come and talk to me. She only said it was a joke when Cathy told her to stop because she could see how freaked out I was. However I have learned to spot these jokes because her tone of voice when she is actually being serious vs \u201cmad joking\u201d is completely different. \n\nToday, before we opened, I asked if I could come in 1-2 hours late tomorrow because I need to sign a lease for an apartment. The bank is very lax about these things and doesn\u2019t care if we come in late/leave early as long as there are two people there. Cathy agreed immediately (after giving me a list of questions to ask my new landlord) but Leah refused and acted angry saying that it was Friday (she missed last Friday) and it was going to be busy (it will after 3, but it never is in the morning) and can\u2019t I do it today (I couldn\u2019t because Cathy was leaving early).  I realized this was one of her joke.\n\nNeither knew, but I\u2019m a great fake crier, so I decided to play my own joke. I started crying.  I didn\u2019t say anything, I just stood there and cried. It wasn\u2019t full blown sobs or anything, just a few tears. Leah apologized immediately, said she was joking, and that of course I could go. I wiped my eyes, and went \u201cGreat! Thanks!\u201d and went about getting ready for the day. \n\nCathy thinks this was justified and funny, but Leah thinks that it was manipulative, saying that if she actually disagreed with me, I could just cry to get her to agree. Now I realize this wasn\u2019t the most mature way to handle things, and if she or anyone else was actually angry with me, I would never attempt to do this, but I thought if she always pulls these types of pranks on me, I should be able to pull this one on her.", "created_utc": 1683251055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1386vqd/aita_for_crying_over_a_prank/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
