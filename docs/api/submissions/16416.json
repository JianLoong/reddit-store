I have never been good at social cues, so I have fallen for these pranks every time until very recently. For example, a few months ago I had to close the bank with a floater, because both Leah and Cathy had to leave early, which was something I had never done before. When I came in the next day she told me I had left the vault door open and that some supervisors from the main branch were going to come and talk to me. She only said it was a joke when Cathy told her to stop because she could see how freaked out I was.

The bank is very lax about these things and doesn\u2019t care if we come in late/leave early as long as there are two people there. Cathy agreed immediately (after giving me a list of questions to ask my new landlord) but Leah refused and acted angry saying that it was Friday (she missed last Friday) and it was going to be busy (it will after 3, but it never is in the morning) and can\u2019t I do it today (I couldn\u2019t because Cathy was leaving early).  I realized this was one of her joke.\n\nNeither knew, but I\u2019m a great fake crier, so I decided to play my own joke. I started crying.  I didn\u2019t say anything, I just stood there and cried. It wasn\u2019t full blown sobs or anything, just a few tears. Leah apologized immediately, said she was joking, and that of course I could go. I wiped my eyes, and went \u201cGreat! Thanks!\u201d and went about getting ready for the day. \n\nCathy thinks this was justified and funny, but Leah thinks that it was manipulative, saying that if she actually disagreed with me, I could just cry to get her to agree.

This sounds more like bullying.", "I used to be into acting and did all the local and school plays from middle school throughout college. Came in handy there.", "NTA. Leah is a bully, which is one of the nicer things I could call her.\n\nAlso are you nd? Some of your phrasing indicates that. If so, she's an ableist bully, to boot. She can pound sand.", "NTA; Leah is making your work life a fucking hell, and she should consider herself lucky that you haven't talked to HR about her \"pranks.\"", "Leah is an AH bully and management should shut her down. You are NTA at all, and I\u2019d send her the link to this thread.

Besides being bullying, it could affect your job performance. If you haven't asked her to stop, do so first. If she continues, or you've already asked her to stop, go to your boss or HR. This could seriously mess you up if she's someday *not* \"joking\" and you think she is, plus it can't be good for your mental health.

NTA", "NTA, but I wonder whether a better approach in the future might be to explicitly ask her every time she says something, 'Is this a prank, or are you being serious right now?' \n\nSay it in front of co-workers (especially in front of co-workers). If they're sick of her pranks, they might start doing the same thing. Make it clear to her that because of her behaviour you no longer trust anything she says. \n\nThis will drive her nuts when she's just trying to do her job, and it will defang her pranks because no one will buy them.", "I feel that \u201cpranks\u201d is another word for bullying these days.", "NTA even if you work at a small branch, this bank should have an HR department of some description. I think you need to get in touch with them, particularly before Leah does. She sounds like a mean spirited untrustworthy bullying sort of person. If she goes to HR about the crying before you get in there to tell them about all the bullying pseudo pranks, that could be bad. HR will not take kindly to somebody joking about leaving a vault door open and that sort of thing.", "NTA!!! Taste of their own medicine", "NTA: Leah is a shit colleague to have and you gave her a taste of her own medicine", "NTA, like at all. Seems like Leah needs to learn how to read certain social cues as well (such as someone NOT laughing at a \"joke\"!!).", "NTA.\n\nThis is not pranking but bullying.", "NTA but dude, you gotta speak with HR if she refuses to stop - she\u2019s creating a hostile work environment and it\u2019s not on", "NTA and it\u2019s past time to report Leah to whoever is above her on the chain of command. Is this bank part of a bigger company?", "NTA the line has long been crossed from pranking to outright bullying. Start to document it and make it clear that you don't appreciate the \"pranks.\" If they continue, then they get to find out.....", "NTA - You don\u2019t have to be mature when dealing with \u201cpranks\u201d (do bear in mind that it\u2019s only a prank if the victim finds it funny, otherwise it\u2019s bullying).", "NTA\n\nAnyplace else that would be called a toxic work environment and a lawsuit for the way she treats you. You really need to go talk to HR before she runs to HR with a story about you.", "NTA. If she can have her fun, so can you, as long you don't use it to manipulate them of course, then you'd be the TA. but because it was a prank, i don't think you're in the wrong.

It is a power play done to you to make you feel inferior the the other person.\n\nI would start give her one warning.

Fuck off.'\n\nThen skip and dance about, gleefully flipping her multiple birds.\n\nProbs best to do this when there's no clients tho.", "NTA. But it's not the right way to handle it. Instead, the next time she pranks you, politely inform her that her behavior is unprofessional. Follow that up by reporting it to management and HR. The very next time she pulls a prank after that, stay calm and professional but immediately report it to management and HR. They should transfer her to another branch, have her work a different shift, or fire her.", "Definitely NTA! \u2018Leah\u2019 sounds like a bully. The fact she can\u2019t take your (entirely appropriate and pretty funny) retaliation in good humour just shows that her behaviour is all about the power dynamics and her belittling you rather than having fun.", "I would not have recovered from the \u201copen vault\u201d joke", "> This sounds more like bullying\n\nLeah sounds exhausting to be around. OP should use weaponized ignorance in response to Leah. Each time she makes a \u201cjoke\u201d or \u201cprank,\u201d ask her to explain in detail what is going on. Ask mundane and repetitive while feigning ignorance. Leah is desperate for an adverse reaction, but she will be the one whose time is being wasted.", "There's been so many times I hold back showing how upset I am only to regret it later. Nah, I cry now. Feel uncomfortable? Good. You did this.", "Is she a manager or in any way in charge of you? If so, this is an abuse of power at worst, completely inappropriate at best. You should speak to HR about her.", "NTA. Pranks are mean-spirited and hostile. You did what she did, and you're wrong? How does THAT work?", "That\u2019s not pranks, that\u2019s bullying. You need to compile a list and send it to HR\n\nNTA", "So, let me make sure I understand. Is this Leah an ADULT? WTF?", "NTA but i think you need to contact your banks head office or manager about bullying in the work place. Make it clear she has made you cry and panicking many times before and yet still keeps doing it knowing it affects you. That on occasion she has told you management are mad at you and setting up a meeting to reprimand you, deliberately to upset you. That she is weaponising you being on the spectrum and not being great with social cues and weaponising it.\n\nPlease include all that so they will see this is bullying in the work place and see how serious this is. I know you may not realise how bad it is as you probably think it\u2019s because you aren\u2019t good with social cues but this is bad. The moment she realised how they affected you she should have stopped. She knowing they will affect you chooses to continue which is bullying. Her apologising once your upset is crap and a lie she\u2019d doing this meaning to get you upset.", "NTA your tears were as mature as her prank", "NTA. Sounds like Leah can give it but not take it, classic AH.", "Nta.\n\nWell done on playing at her level.", "She joked so you joked nothing wrong NTA", "Nta. The \"pranks\" you are describing are not pranks. Pranks are supposed to be funny. Your coworker is just being immature and bratty. You didn't do anything wrong. It's unfortunate for her that she can't take what she dishes out. That is not your concern though. Hopefully, she will stop with the nonsense. Also, sometimes people cry. Especially when they are upset. Crying does not automatically mean manipulation and most people who believe it does are manipulative themselves. Yes, some people use crying as manipulation but usually it is an expression of genuine emotion.", "NTA, cry away. You\u2019re doing the exact same thing as her", "NTA. Seems more like bullying to me as you're clearly not enjoying all these pranks. Leah sounds like a real AH.

But Leah is playing a very clever game in some ways. If people want something, bet they got to another colleague first as exhausting to deal with her. And hard to blame her for anything as may be a prank. But because she will help eventually if helped, still seem as collegiate."]}
