So far it's been a wonderful experience, especially the birth and pregnancy. However I had one somewhat bad experience early on that I forgot about until now.\n\nFor my first appointment I didn't know that instead of over the belly ultrasounds, they do vaginal ultrasounds. The technician came in and right away she seemed cold and upset? It wasn't anything egregious and I figured she was just having a bad day or wasn't a very friendly person. She started doing the exam and I was immediately super uncomfortable. \n\nI have a minor case of Vaginismus that I've recovered from but sometimes I can get triggered back into it. I started hurting so I told her to stop. She didn't and pushed it in further at which point I clamped my legs shut. She then turned to my boyfriend and told him to tell me to relax because she couldn't do the exam like this. My boyfriend was able to get me to relax and hold my hand so I could focus on the joy of seeing our baby for the first time. She was very cold and rough the whole time. My boyfriend asked her a few questions that she seemed annoyed to answer but did.\n\nI get dressed and at this point she comes back into the room and is super friendly all of a sudden. She asks if I feel any discomfort and coos over the photos with us. We were very perplexed. We brought up a few ideas but came up short, and I chose not to report because I never saw her again and I couldn't come up with a reason wht she acted like that. \n\nOne of my friends has a little sister who is 17. She found out she is pregnant a few weeks ago. It was not a planned situation but she and her boyfriend are choosing to keep the baby and I've supported them along with her sister. She had her intake appointment this Wednesday and came back from it very upset. She told us how her ultrasound technician was super rude and seemed to be purposely rough and mean to her. After she got her packet and left the room, she heard her talking to another nurse. She didn't hear the whole thing but definitely heard \"young floozies\". She didn't know what that word meant but when she got back to her car she googled it and cried.\n\nI asked her to describe the technician, and of course it was the same woman. At this point I realized what had happened. Everyone from my family to strangers say I look super young for my age. She must've thought I was a teen but when she left the room she looked at my chart and saw I was 25, and that's why she was suddenly super friendly. I didn't know why I didn't think of that but I was really pissed at this point. I told her we have to go together and report her.\n\nShe isn't sure if she wants to report her. She says the other doctors will get mad at her and she'll have to use a different hospital. Her sister agrees with me however, and so does my boyfriend. Some have said it's been too long and I should just let it go, we can't be sure that she was being rude because of that, etc. WIBTA if I went foward in reporting her?", "created_utc": 1670614670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zh6i3n/wibta_for_reporting_an_ultrasound_technician/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you should report your experience only and leave your friend\u2019s sister out of it. As a teen mom, your sister\u2019s friend has enough anxiety regarding these appointments. She doesn\u2019t need it made worse by fear of retaliation from other practitioners in this clinic. Your experience is more than enough for this woman\u2019s supervisors to take your complaint seriously.", "NTA - You are being a good friend to go with this young woman and support her in this difficult situation.  It's disgusting how even women continue to participate in and facilitate the mistreatment of other women in gender-based care.  If there is ever a time when women are vulnerable and need to be treated with respect and compassion, this situation is one of them.  So many women end up letting serious problems go untreated because they don't want to face what is essentially a sexual assault for the sake of medical care.  That tech is a disgrace to her profession and should definitely be reported.  Frankly, I'd be after her job, but I get pretty draconian.", "You will be the A if you DON'T report this B. \nNTA", "NAH - The tech is an AH obviously, but neither you nor your friends sister is. You are in a tough spot because your complaint won't go as far unless you report both situations to demonstrate a pattern of behavior. On the one hand, this person should not be in this job and it is fair to say you have a responsibility to report her so that she does not treat other patients this way. But on the other hand your friend's sister (unfortunately) has legitimate concerns and the potential consequences all fall on her. She is also a victim in this and she gets to decide what is best for her. \n\nHopefully once your friend's sister establishes a relationship with her OB she will feel more comfortable expressing her concerns about the tech and then you can back her up with your experience. But right now she is young, scared, and pregnant - she does not need to take on the added stress or burden of fighting ineptitude or cruelty on behalf of others. Give her a minute to wrap her head around her situation and then bring it up again. Helping her feel confident and supported will go a long way in getting her to a place where she is comfortable reporting this behavior.", "NTA - I have vaginismus too and vaginal exams are absolute hell because of it. Sometimes I've gone too exams and the technician hasnt even heard of vaginismus", "YTA - if you report what she said. That is all hearsay and you have no idea what actually happened.

The doctors won't be mad at her, they'll be furious with the technician for the way she's been behaving.  You both need to report her because what if, God forbid, she's the ultrasound tech for a teenager who was raped?\n\n>She must've thought I was a teen but when she left the room she looked at my chart and saw I was 25, and that's why she was suddenly super friendly. I didn't know why I didn't think\n\nBecause *no* healthcare provider should treat patients of different ages differently.  You wouldn't expect a healthcare provider to be nice to adults and rough with teenagers.  You'd expect them to treat everyone the same.\n\nI worked in healthcare and had a few patients that were absolute assholes towards me.  They'd tell me I'd have to like them if I wanted to get paid and that they could treat me like crap and were shocked when I'd respond with \"I don't have to like you, in order to get paid.  I do have to be nice and pleasant towards you even when you are acting like a complete jerk, but I'm not your friend.\"  I was never rough with a patient (some would disagree but with physical therapy some of the things we'd have to do would hurt but it was never deliberate), regardless of age or attitude but if I didn't like them, I didn't go out of my way to be friendly with them.", " That\u2019s also super unacceptable behavior. When I had my first pregnancy ultrasound the woman very patiently and sweetly explained that it was a transvaginal ultrasound and what that meant though I cut her off to explain that I had my baby through IVF so had experienced approximately 9,000 of them at that point. So even her not explaining what she was going to do before doing it is awful, and to be rough and rude is unacceptable", "YWNBTA.\nI've had 2 nurses and a doctor fired for their treatment of me and my friend. We had come in because I had a seizure and they didn't believe us, and dismissed us until I had a second one right outside the hospital", "YWNBTA if you reported her. But ever ultrasound I have ever seen has the moms birthdate on it. Maybe it\u2019s different elsewhere? \nRegardless of how awful she treated you, it may have had nothing to do with your age. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you and others were hurt by her. \nTotally wrong.", "That is her main concern. We talked some more today and she told me she does want to report her but is scared the other doctors will know it was her and she'll have to switch OBGYNs. There are only two hospitals in town and the other one has some issues. She could always go out of town but that would mean at least an extra 30-45 mins of driving.", "My friend telling me she seemed to be purposely rough was definitely a wake up call to me, because with my tendency to tense up during exams I wasn't sure at first if it she was even being rough. Especially since I never had one done before. Now I realize that even once I relaxed it was still so uncomfortable, and that is not the way it should've been.", "Thank you, my boyfriend and I thought we must've imagined it because her attitude was so unproffesional. Before she came back acting nice he acutally thought maybe she was racist because although I'm a super pale latina I have a very hispanic name, but then she was being so kind and we had no idea what her problem was.", "Thank you. I didn't have enough room with word count to talk about this but I had a very bad experience when I was a teen and a virgin. I went in to a gynecologist for the first time and they told me they were out of lube and when told them she was hurting me she refused to listen so I had to physically push her away from me. She then asked me if I \"was acutally concerned about the whole virginity thing\" I told her that I was concerned she was hurting me and she scoffed and walked away. My mom and I reported them, but that experience is definitely a lot of the reason I tend to tense up during exams/putting in a tampon and need a second to relax.", "That's what I was wondering because I don't want to push her into reporting but my experience was over a year ago and without the context of my friend hearing the floozy comment I am unsure if they'll take it seriously.", "I'm honestly pretty mad because everyome else in the hospital are the nicest doctors I've ever met. They did so much for me and sent me cards after birth, etc. Super helpful, so the fact they have this lady there is really disappointing to me.", "Yeah we've been talking and she's so very angry but definitely scared. I know she wants to report but I can definitely understand why she feels she shouldn't. My friend is bringing her over tomorrow and hopefully with a couple of days to think she'll make the desicion she feels is best.", "Damn I'm so sorry to hear that. Mine used to be very intense as well, it was so hard because no one knew what was wrong or how to help me. My first boyfriend and I had such hard time being intimate with each other because even just a finger would make me freak out. Honestly it really only has fully gone away after I gave birth. They brought out a mirror for me and it freaked me out at first but then I something clicked where I suddenly became comfortable with my vagina for the first time.", "[removed]", "I agree.

He was pretty pissed when it happened but didn't know what to do and decided to focus on getting me to relax and be comfortable. Also the fact that she asked him to get me to relax instead of talking to me directly really angered us. It felt as if she was acting like I wasn't even there.", "My mom acutally confronted a doctor at urgent care for that exact thing. My step grandfather lives in Puerto Rico but comes to visit us during hurricane season. He had a heart attack a decade ago so he takes high blood pressure medication and keeps a close eye on his health. His blood pressure went up last time he was here so my mom took him to urgent care so she could translate for him. The nurse said his prescribed high blood pressure medication wasn't acutally for high blood pressure and totally dimissed them. As they were leaving my mom googled the medication and found it acutally is for high blood pressure and heard the doctor talking shit about them to two nurses about how the medicaion was in Spanish and she couldn't read it and it was ridiculous, even though it was not in Spanish lol and at no point did she ask my mom to translate if she acutally thought it was in Spanish, nor did she look it up herself.  My mom walked up to her and showed her the google results and tore her a new asshole. Very frustrating that this seems to be happen way too often.", "I think the main reason she thinks they'll be angry is because of the conversation she heard her having with nurse when she called her a floozy. The nurse was laughing and while she knows that doesn't nessecarily mean she agreed with her but it does mean she might.\n\nAlso although I knew her for years through her sister we were never close because of our age gap. We only became friends because during covid I unfortunately got a pay deduction. I needed to pick up a part time job and my friend and her sister told me I should apply to the fast food place they were working at. It was a slow place so when we worked together we often had downtime to talk and became close friends. We also had a male coworker who was super creepy to the underage girls. We reported him to our boss a few times to no avail so she finally decided to record him and he was fired. He figured out that with the timing it must have been her so he started stalking the place and yelling at her from the parking lot. Our shitty boss was pissed so he also fired her. Her sister and I and three other giirls quit in solidarity.\n\nWe have been on the phone woth one another today and she cited that experience as part of the reason she expects retaliation. She knows the medical board is definitely not our shitty fast food boss but that still haunts her.", "The photos did have my birthdate on them but she didn't even grab them when she printed them lol. She stormed out of the room and I grabbed them myself before I got dressed. I'm not sure if she was just im a rush and maybe didn't look at my chart carefully before doing the ultrasound. It could be something else but it seems the most likely.", "The doctors won't know. If she calls in an anonymous report on the hospital tip line, they won't even tell the tech who said it, just report that she was rough and hostile with a patient.", "yea no it is DEFINITELY not supposed to be like that, also (at least from my experience with my pregnancies) they aren't really supposed to go inside you like that for the first visit unless there are possibly health issues with you or the baby. That kind of thing isn't supposed to happen until way later. (But this is just my experience with it)", "Holy shit, that makes this even worse, I'm so so sorry, if I couls hug you, if that's allowed, I would. Much love ma'am!!", "Wtfffff I'm so sorry you went through these terrible experiences", "It doesn\u2019t matter if it was a year ago. The exam was making you uncomfortable, you asked her to stop and she didn\u2019t listen. Your bf was there as a witness. You can always tell her supervisor that you decided to come forward because a friend of yours had a similar experience with the same woman not too long ago and it made you realize that if you don\u2019t speak up, more patients will have to go through this. If they ask you to share more about your friend\u2019s experience you can just say that she\u2019s not comfortable coming forward and it\u2019s not my place to share it for her. \n\nAs for the floozy comment, I think even if your friend was willing to come forward, you probably shouldn\u2019t report it. Although it\u2019s more likely than not that she was talking about your friend, you have no way of knowing what she was really talking about because your friend didn\u2019t hear the entire conversation. All this woman has to do is claims she was talking about someone else and her supervisor will take her word for it. It\u2019s not your job to draw conclusions about why this woman behaved the way she did. That\u2019s the supervisor\u2019s job.

You need to report her for sure, imagine if she had done that to someone with sexual assault history.", "Wow op that is horrible. All the more reason to speak up though", "They won't be angry with her at all, they'll be angry with the tech and the nurse she was talking to (the nurse for not reporting it, unless she already did).  The nurse was probably laughing because it was more like a \"I can't believe you're actually saying this.  Wow am I uncomfortable!\" laugh than thinking the tech was being funny or that she agreed with her.\n\nWhat you could do is talk to the docs and say, \"she's uncomfortable about reporting her own experience because she's afraid you'll be angry with her and due to personal experiences, she's afraid you'll retaliate against her for reporting it.\"  The doctors can then reassure her that they don't blame her and thank her for reporting it.", "Ahhh yeah who knows? The why is less important I suppose but shitty nonetheless!", "I'll let her know this for sure. I asked my mother because I know she had to switch doctors during her pregnancy with me. When she had my brother years before she had a fine experience but then found out a week later the hospital sadly had a baby die of natural causes in the nursery. They did not clean the bassinet and put a healthy baby in it that also unfortunately died. So when she was pregnant with me she wanted to be switched to a different OBGYN even though it was going to cost a lot more. They caused such a stink and when she complained about them to higher ups they tried to blacklist her from the other hospital and sent her a nasty email. That was a different state and happened a long time ago but I can definitely understand the fear because people can be crazy.", "I got three ultrasounds before my third trimester. That one at 9 weeks, one at 12 weeks where they were listening to her heartbeat, and my hour long twenty week anatomy ultrasound which was thankfully done on the belly.", "That\u2019s not necessarily true. They do often have to do transvaginal ultrasounds if it\u2019s a little earlier on in the pregnancy because that\u2019s the only way you can see anything.", "I appreciate it! I don't know why I seem have to have shit luck with gynecologists. I also had one that was really nice but kept misdiagnosing me with UTIs for months when I acutally had BV.", "Thank you, I think she thought I was worried she was going to break my hymen even though I knew by that point that's not how it works. Also when the exam was over she told me that my concern over lots of discharge was wrong and that I just have a lot of discharge. When I told her my mom said it looked concerning she said \"your just unlucky and your mom is not\" come to find out two years later that I had chronic BV \ud83d\ude44.

Many practices wait until closer to 12 weeks for the first appointment where you can get a good view through the belly but at 8 weeks you would need to do transvaginal. The cutoff is somewhere between 8 and 12 weeks and if it\u2019s getting closer to 12 they may try the normal way to see if they get a good enough view but may have to resort to transvaginal", "I know who you said it to.
