But future children are presumably years away. Again, your mom still seems to have the power to drag you into hypotheticals that may never happen. She\u2019s conducting the classic narcissistic experiment by floating out her ideas about how her grandchildren will be baptized. When she hears your views on the subject, she\u2019s learning where she must apply MORE pressure on you to get her way in the future. It\u2019s all a big power flex to keep you meek and compliant. It only works with your permission.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to completely put a stop to any further discussions about your future plans. Just do not bring up that personal stuff, EVER.

So I just don't trust her enough to do something as important as my wedding dress I guess.", "I get that you're not meant to see the behind the scenes but unfortunately I have which has led to me to not feel comfortable and uncertain when it comes to ordering anything from her.", "The issue is people will talk I'm afraid, since we live on an island so the mentality is for people to talk and gossip. So I understand her concern.", "I'm saying \"cheap shot\" as in, there was no reason to bring it up. My brother is often late to things. If we were planning something, I'd be reasonable to mention/consider it. But if during idle chit chat I mentioned \"I'd never ask him for a ride to the airport if I were planning a trip, because he'd be late\" then that would be a cheap shot, even if it were based in fact.", "She should be judged on the finished product.... if her customers are satisfied & happy that\u2019s all she needs to care about. How she gets the job done is no one\u2019s concern. If she has not ever done a dress for you, I\u2019m not sure how you can judge her. Unless all her customers are unhappy. \n\nMy sisters have all at some point helped out or worked with with me. They know what it looks like in the back of the house & how I operate. They also know what the finished product looks like & how well my company does the job. They have no problem recommending me to their friends & asking for my help with their events. I would be very unhappy if I ever heard them badmouthing my business if they were just complaining about me personally. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to order from your sister that\u2019s totally fine however you may want to find another reason. If her customers trust her, there\u2019s no reason you shouldn\u2019t. She\u2019s not your sister at work. She\u2019s a seamstress & the owner of a business."]}
