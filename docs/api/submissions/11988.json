{"id": 11988, "submission_id": "11o6c3n", "title": "AITA for blowing up on my son's girlfriend?", "selftext": "My husband thinks I'm in the right, but my niece helped me make this post on here to see what other people think.\n\nI (52f) have three sons ages ranging from 13 to 20. My oldest son (20m) has a girlfriend (19f) that hands around our house a lot... It's a really small house and doesn't have a lot of space. She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap.\n\nIt is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household.\n\nYesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with the jug water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: \"Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated.\"\n\nI found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything.\n\nMy son told me that I was a major asshole and should have just minded my business. I think she's just wasteful and a brat. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments. I have spoken to my son about the issue, and you all made me realize that it was deeper than just the water. I showed him this post and explained that it's not her, it's me. I think she reacted that way when I initially told her off for filling up the bottle because--and my son helped me realize this, too--I was never really nice to her to begin with, in the course of their three year relationship (in my defense, she only started hanging around our house a lot about six months ago because she got a license). \n\nWe called her on the phone this morning and I apologized for my reaction to the bottle. I explained I didn't mean to make her feel bad about the water--it really wasn't that big of a deal, and I feel silly for making it a big deal. She apologized for having an attitude and explained how she can feel a little defensive around me sometimes. I told her and my son that I will work on my attitude. My husband still thinks she was being disrespectful but I explained that I'm the reason she felt the need to act that way in the first place. It's not my choice who my son decided to date and I need to respect his choice. I think she is a sweet girl, and I feel horrible for the way I have been treating her. Again, thank you to everyone for making me realize my mistake.\n\nPS: I have looked into purchasing a Brita pitcher to see if that is more cost effective. My son's girlfriend now brings water from home--although I didn't tell her to do that.", "created_utc": 1678496017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11o6c3n/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_sons_girlfriend/", "score": 14637, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've got a feeling there's some missing information here...", "Just tell your son that he and his girlfriend need to hang out somewhere else. You start off by saying she annoys you and you don\u2019t think she\u2019s right for your son. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s your biggest fan either. The water is just a minor part of the bigger issue", "Okay.\n\nYTA, but I'm going to try to explain why in a constructive way so you hopefully understand all sides of this.\n\nFirst of all, you have the right to lay down the law of your land in your house. That includes who is in it, who is using your supplies, how they're used, and what conduct you expect from guests. Your guests (including your son) also have the basic human right to take offense at your hostility. Nobody likes to be treated like a burden or an imposition, and you've put this girl in a difficult situation where she feels like in order to enjoy her boyfriend, she has to put up with your antagonism, justified or not. That's exhausting for everyone.\n\nThe fact is that you're 52 and she's 19, and as the owner of your house, *you* need to be the one who communicates your desires clearly, not passive-aggressively. You're trying to play both sides by subtly driving her away with your antagonism while also not giving your son cause to be angry with you. The absolute kindest way I can put this is that what you're doing right now is reactionary communication instead of preemptive communication. You clearly have a problem with this girl and everybody knows it. By being passive-aggressive and at times openly hostile to her in order to drive her away, you're disrespecting your son's choice and trying to impose your will on him. This isn't about the water: it's about you wanting her out of your house, and because you're not clearly putting down boundaries, these little things are adding up and blowing over.\n\nShe is 19 and likely doesn't understand why you're so hostile. If you would rather not have her in your house all the time, communicate that with her. Tell her it's stressing you out to have guests over all the time and that you're feeling claustrophobic. There are many direct, mature ways you can handle this situation, but it starts with *you,* not her. You're the one with the problem.\n\n\\---\n\nEdit --- absolutely did not anticipate this blowing up. Thank you so much for the awards, kind words, and insightful conversation. I read everything over breakfast this morning and had a really good time watching people bounce opinions off each other.\n\nI wanted to respond to one comment I kept seeing pop up -- which person OP should be taking her complaints to, her son or his girlfriend.  Tbh when I re-read the post, the proprietary tone OP took when speaking about him (\"I don't think she's right for him\") suggested a couple of things to me: her methods with communicating with her son are outdated and new adult boundaries need to be drawn so they can co-exist in a healthy way, and the value she places in their relationship is preventing her from expressing her frustrations honestly. She doesn't mind her son being there in that small space: she minds his girlfriend. In an either/or situation where she forces him to choose, she might not like the choice he makes. Instead of taking that risk, she's settled for a passive-aggressive antagonism that pressure-cooked the situation up to the point where everything exploded over bottled water.\n\nI'm not going to get into the politics of \"19/20 year olds should move out\" -- I don't care about the age of adult children living at home. It's a tough market and everybody's survival tactics are valid. What I do care about is the mother and girlfriend having an adult conversation between themselves, *without* the need to use the son as a mediator between them, so they can both express themselves without filters. Once OP has taken the steps to mend the situation she's co-created with the girlfriend, they can both take the situation to the son and have a group meeting about what to do in the future. But for right now, the son doesn't need to be in the crosshairs of this argument. OP and girlfriend both need this practice.\n\nEdit 2 -- Such good conversation all around, omg. Those who are pushing back on my intervention strategies, your disagreement is valid and I've loved thinking about all the different ways to approach this issue today.\n\nThe problem I have with blaming the son for not mitigating sooner + involving him directly in the intervention is that it isn't clear to me if the mother has communicated her exact issue with either of them. It's been a drip-drip effect of indirect hostility leveled at the girlfriend, and based on the way OP talks about this situation, there's a good chance that kind of cloak-and-dagger antagonism went under his radar. The girlfriend is a teenager and also might not know how to accurately translate OP's behavior. The fact that OP describes her as a kind girl is important context. It's taken a while to get to the point where this girl snapped under pressure and backsassed OP in her home, and while I agree it isn't fair to put a 19 year-old toe to toe against a 52 year-old mother of three, I also worry that involving the son right away might escalate the situation if he's put on the spot to defend one of them over the other. There should be an even balance of power in the room so no one's voice gets drowned out. If the girl's parents are around, one should sit in. If they're not... there's probably a good reason the girl is over there so often.  \n\n\nLAST EDIT -- Wonderful update from OP. This is the good side of AITA.

My oldest son (20m) has a girlfriend (19f) that hands around our house a lot... It's a really small house and doesn't have a lot of space. She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap.\n\nIt is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household.\n\nYesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with our tap water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: \"Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated.\" \n\nI found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything.\n\nMy son told me that I was a major asshole and should have just minded my business. I think she's just wasteful and a brat. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP has a valid complaint that her son has essentially moved his girlfriend in without asking, and is also forcing OP to the foot the bill (I\u2019m guessing this girl also takes showers, eats food, etc, that OP pays for). \n\nThe problem is that instead of having an adult conversation with her son or the GF or both about the change and what\u2019s expected, she\u2019s being passive aggressive.", "I think the op is mostly just concerned that the girlfriend is spending too much time at their house and it boiled over with the water issue being the catalyst", "This girl is laid up in someone's mom's house every day. The least she could do is bring her own supplies. You don't go to someone's house & eat & drink up all their stuff. That's common sense & home training.", "Wandering children unite! \n\nBut yeah I feel you on the \u201ccorrupting the boy\u201d thing, she literally called me a slut not-so under her breath more times than I can count, but little did she know her little boy was the pushy fkn sex pest but who\u2019d ever listen to that? It\u2019s sad that that bullshit was still better than going home. I\u2019m doing my best to be the adult I needed, and I hope you\u2019re doing good these days :)", "There will be posts about like, legit domestic abuse and violence and then in comes the AITA Redditor foaming at the mouth to get in their SUPER HILARIOUS mAriNaRa fLaG quip and it's like.... how fucking tone deaf??", "This thread made my weekend.", "I get what you\u2019re saying but I was more referring to \u201cwhat person describing the horrific water quality in an unsafe drinking water area to a group of peers without an agenda would describe dangerous water as \u2018not tasty?\u2019\u201d", "Because she drinks too much water", "No women is ever right for me or my brother according to my mum, think it\u2019s just a certain type of mum thing.     she found out recently that I\u2019ve been dating with the purpose of not starting a relationship and she keeps telling me to be safe because I could get stabbed by the dated.

It's really fking weird.", "That's what I was thinking -- my guests are free to drink as much beer as they can safely (and legally) handle, but if someone is walking out the door with a six-pack of the beer I bought, they are definitely not welcome back.\n\nDitto having a glass of water, versus putting eight glasses of water into a jug.\n\nAnd if the girlfriend is going to need a full day of water, because she's there dawn to dusk, she should probably be doing some chores or otherwise contributing, rather than lecturing OP.", "I mind it way less than pesto and marinara flags, which, thankfully seems to have ceased.", "Ugh, the marinara flags thing is the single most cringey and obnoxious thing ive ever seen on reddit", "And they think they're sooooo funny because they Referenced A Thing", "Also if I were said girlfriend that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019d start doing, find OP or call her and be like \u201cmay I have a glass of water?\u201d Every time I was thirsty.", "I made an edit, everyone. Thank you for your comments.", "ESH. It's extremely difficult to share living space routinely with someone who is not family. There is a reason why the phrase guests like fish stink after three days. She is most likely eating your food, drinking your drinks, getting in the way and OP never invited her.  OP needs to have a serious discussion with the son to set ground rules on visitation such as how much time she should be spending at the house etc. because this will keep happening with future GF's.  Throwing the GF out of the house was uncalled for such a relatively minor offense. All three of you need to be more respectful.", "Right? And you know the second the precious son wants to move out and live with the gf OP is gonna freak tf out. Because this issue has nothing to do with water or the living situation, it\u2019s just that OP hates the gf. Nothing the gf does will ever be good enough for OP.", "What a wonderful update! When a post blows up like this, and the comments reach an overwhelming amount, it's not uncommon for the OP to either get defensive, or just shut down. I commend you for not only taking in the criticism, but also for using it to benefit everyone involved.", "A great edit with self awareness. I think maybe attempting to find common ground with her would be great moving forward so you can have a more positive relationship. You might even surprise yourself!\n\nI only say that because you also can't know she is the one. If she isn't, the worst thing that happens is you were kind to a girl he used to know. Worst case, that girl is the one and now his own mother was unkind to her throughout their relationship. Which would you prefer?", "They're both assholes. Like you said respect is not automatic so why would it be automatic you get to leech from the mom you call an asshole?", "My grandparents had well water when they lived rural. After grandpa passed away, and she moved to town. She said the water tasted like chlorine.", "and fucking expensive.", "Uh, I was just clarifying something in the original post for another commenter who missed it. Not speculating on the girlfriend's motives.", "That last sentence nails it. She\u2019s there for the WHOLE dang day! Where is the self awareness on her part that\u2019s she\u2019s asking for an entire days worth of beverages all the time?!

The stuff I had when I moved to the city was 100x better haha.", "In Silicon Valley, for instance, there are plumes of perchlorate in the groundwater, from years of making rocket fuel.

Water has to be delivered and filled into those tanks at the homeowners expense. \n\nThe problem is the water has been shut off to many of these towns due to drought conditions, and there not being enough. Families can\u2019t find anyone to deliver right now. They\u2019re having to use other sources further and further away, at an outrageous expense. The water does come out of the tap, but it\u2019s not an endless source like major cities where people are on city water systems. \n\nNot everywhere even in the US has water. It\u2019s scary and sad. People don\u2019t always remember that.", "My local water once was discovered to have killed a kid with meningitis. Yeah there were several issues that ended up leading to this but I've been paranoid ever since.\n\nI have a filter in my fridge which helps with the anxiety and keep costs down.
