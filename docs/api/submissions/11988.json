My oldest son (20m) has a girlfriend (19f) that hands around our house a lot... It's a really small house and doesn't have a lot of space. She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap.\n\nIt is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household.\n\nYesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with the jug water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: \"Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated.\"\n\nI found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything.\n\nMy son told me that I was a major asshole and should have just minded my business. I think she's just wasteful and a brat.

I've got a feeling there's some missing information here...", "Just tell your son that he and his girlfriend need to hang out somewhere else. You start off by saying she annoys you and you don\u2019t think she\u2019s right for your son. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s your biggest fan either. The water is just a minor part of the bigger issue", "Okay.   \n\n\nYTA, but I'm going to try to explain why in a constructive way so you hopefully understand all sides of this.   \n\n\nFirst of all, you have the right to lay down the law of your land in your house. That includes who is in it, who is using your supplies, how they're used, and what conduct you expect from guests. Your guests (including your son) also have the basic human right to take offense at your hostility. Nobody likes to be treated like a burden or an imposition, and you've put this girl in a difficult situation where she feels like in order to enjoy her boyfriend, she has to put up with your antagonism, justified or not. That's exhausting for everyone.  \n\n\nThe fact is that you're 52 and she's 19, and as the owner of your house, *you* need to be the one who communicates your desires clearly, not passive-aggressively. You're trying to play both sides by subtly driving her away with your antagonism while also not giving your son cause to be angry with you. The absolute kindest way I can put this is that what you're doing right now is reactionary communication instead of preemptive communication. You clearly have a problem with this girl and everybody knows it. By being passive-aggressive and at times openly hostile to her in order to drive her away, you're disrespecting your son's choice and trying to impose your will on him. This isn't about the water: it's about you wanting her out of your house, and because you're not clearly putting down boundaries, these little things are adding up and blowing over.   \n\n\nShe is 19 and likely doesn't understand why you're so hostile. If you would rather not have her in your house all the time, communicate that with her. Tell her it's stressing you out to have guests over all the time and that you're feeling claustrophobic. There are many direct, mature ways you can handle this situation, but it starts with *you,* not her. You're the one with the problem.", "Could you get like a filter for the water. Or some kind of pipe/water main attachment. This seems like a really big argument over something so small.", "INFO I\u2019m curious, have you spoken with your son and his gf about how much time she is over at your house? Like sat down and had a calm and productive conversation with him/them about why she is over so much?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is a clear cut answer to if you are the AH or not, but perhaps this is more of a communication breakdown between your kid, his gf, and yourself. You readily admit you don\u2019t like her, and her near constant presence is getting on your nerves. And while you were communicative about the water/grocery expense, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve had a conversation around boundaries and time spent in the home. This also sounds like the water was the final straw so to speak, not necessarily the root cause of the problem.", "ESH. She needs to be more courteous. But you also need to stop judging who is good enough for your son", "ESH. You shouldn't have blown up at her like that, but she's absolutely overstaying her welcome.

It will dramatically improve your water quality.", "INFO: do you live in a country or area where potable water is scarce? \n\nMany of these commenters seem to have never been to less developed nations.

OP if you have a p with how often gf is over then you need to have a conversation with your son. Whether or not you like her she\u2019s still a guest but she\u2019s acting like family.

You need to figure out a better solution to have more drinkable water available to people. Ideally, an average human needs a minimum of 2 liters of water a day. Asking people to limit their water intake is an AH move because it is an essential need.", "Honestly ESH- it sounds like you don\u2019t like the gf for multiple reasons and the water was the final straw.

Along with what everyone else is saying, that's all of her water for the entire day.

Just sounds like you\u2019re jealous someone else has your son\u2019s attention", "ESH.\n\nHer for the way she spoke to you. \n\nYou for the way you spoke to her.  \n\nYour son for telling you to mind your own business.\n\nThere\u2019s no difference between filling a bottle of water versus filling multiple cups. If you\u2019re going to buy water you kind of have to accept that people are going to drink it. \n\nThat said, this screaming match wasn\u2019t about the water. This is about the fact that y\u2019all just don\u2019t like each other. \n\nIf you feel like she\u2019s there too often have a talk with your son and set boundaries. Letting things boil over like this and calling her out of her name is only going to fracture the relationship between you and your son. Forget about her for a second.\n\nAlso ask yourself why you don\u2019t like this girl. Do you not like her being around because this is your first time having to deal with one of your son\u2019s serious girlfriends? If so, this problem isn\u2019t ever going to get better (even if they break up) until you do some soul searching. \n\nRegardless, whether you just hate her because you hate her or she actually sucks, you should still probably set boundaries/establish rules with your son.", "ESH\n\nI get the same delivery and it can really add up. It is not your responsibility to provide all the water she needs stay hydrated for the day.\n\nFor her to be dismissive when she\u2019s a guest who has overstated her welcome, who DOESN\u2019T LEAVE WHEN TOLD TO, is hella inappropriate and disrespectful. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have unleashed on her, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019d get the hint or even listen unless you did.", "Esh you need to set boundaries with your son regarding having his gf over.

You kicked an adult out of your home for the crime of drinking water. \n\nIt's a weird power-trip to deny someone hydration. You choose to have the source of water (a biological necessity) in your home be something impractical and expensive, rather than cheaper alternatives. It's not \"wasteful\" for her to pour herself a glass/bottle of water, it's just that you don't like her and don't want her using it.\n\nIf you don't want her over at your house, or you want to be compensated for the extra water, have that be the issue that you take up with your son - not with her - and address it separately.", "ESH. I can't imagine being a guest in someone's home and being as rude as she was and willing to waste other people's resources, especially one that I've warned about; but, I also think this water rationing situation is a bit of a shit show, and I'd also feel super uncomfortable in someone's home where I'd be judged for drinking water. There must be a better way to get your family and guests access to water.", "ESH\n\nIf you don\u2019t want her over, how about you use your big girl words and communicate that to your son. \u201cHey son, can you and gf limit being here, I need some space\u201d rather than passive aggressively blowing up over water of all thing.

Better to just wait it out.", "YTA - if you were upset about the frequency of your son's guest you should have spoken directly to him about it. Dito for their resource consumption.

I don\u2019t get the pure Y T A comments because I\u2019m fairly certain these people have never had bottled water delivered to the house.

My oldest son (20m) has a girlfriend (19f) that hands around our house a lot... It's a really small house and doesn't have a lot of space. She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap.\n\nIt is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household.\n\nYesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with our tap water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: \"Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated.\" \n\nI found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything.\n\nMy son told me that I was a major asshole and should have just minded my business. I think she's just wasteful and a brat. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Needed by everyone. Heavy water that she has to carry and refill and buy and haul from the store. Have you ever done all these things? For a household? Every day/every week without fail? \n\nNo, you haven't and I know that because you so casually dismiss her labor, time & money.

Yes if she thirsty she should get a cup and have a drink but she is filling it up from their drinkable water and taking alot from the pot so to speak.", "Yes because I have well water that isn't the safest to drink. To get the water my body needs to survive, I have extra steps. It doesn't just come out of my tap.", "The tap water is potable, just funky.  That's the basic need.

It's water!  She's not wasting it, she's drinking it!", "Sorry - but this is a BS statement. He's 20 and living in their home. If she \"deserves\" to be cursed at then she should find he on place.

OP has to pay to get it and have it delivered. Change out water for juice in this situation. If you pay to have juice and then pay more to have it delivered and then someone comes over and drinks a large portion of your juice do you have the right to be angry?

OP's got a lot of problems alright.", "\"Special water\"?  It's just filtered water.
