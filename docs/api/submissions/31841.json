Before that my father had a secret family which he concealed from us. He was seeing another woman since before he married my mom. My father then married his mistress and moved in with her and my half-brother(17).\n\nLast week he asked me if I would go on a three week trip with him. It\u2019s for my half-brother\u2019s birthday and he said he really wants his two sons to get along. I told him \u2018No.\u2019 He asked me why, so I explained \u2018My dog needs a booster shot during that time frame, and I can calm her down a lot better than mom can. I have to be at the vet\u2019s to soothe her.\u2019\n\nHe frowned and said that I should care more about my brother than my dog so I asked \u2018Why though? I only see him once a month when I visit you and during my visits he and I don\u2019t interact. He just sits there listening to Ben Shapiro the whole time. No interactions with me. That\u2019s it.

We didn\u2019t grow up together, we never played together, we don\u2019t even go to the same school. Like, I\u2019m more willing to help him out in serious trouble but I\u2019m not THAT interested in going on a long holiday with him. More interested in being with my dog.\n\nMy father still isn\u2019t satisfied though and said he\u2019s disappointed in me, and that I could be a better brother by at least pretending to love him.", "created_utc": 1701057523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184ty3i/aita_for_telling_my_father_that_i_care_a_lot_more/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dog or no dog, no is a valid answer.  Your father can wish all he wants for his 2 sons to be close, but you are not obliged to make it happen (or to pretend to) so he can feel less guilty.
