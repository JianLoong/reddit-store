Who cares how much he makes, if you would have paid him otherwise then WTF?", "YTA\n\nYou sent the 7 year old to sit with him, and had him bring the kid to the bathroom, when he came on his *day off* to support your other son.

That sounds like Mike came because he truly cares about your kid.\n\nHowever YTA for making assumptions about Mike's finances. Just because Mike makes a certain amount at his other job that shouldn't devalue his labour. People should be paid on the value of the work that they do. If you ever ask Mike to take on extra work or hours, he should be paid for that time.", "> \"Mike\" has been with us for four years. During the day, he works as an assistant for some bank firm and remotely. I've seen his paychecks and he's making $35 an hour so he isn't poor.\n\nYTA. This has no bearing on whether or not you are obligated to pay someone for their labor", "YTA. You shouldn't have let your son go over there without asking Mike. It was his day off and you put him in an awkward position. Yes, you should have paid him.  His wage at his other job is entirely irrelevant.  Be more considerate next time and learn to tell your kid \"no.\"", "YTA\nMike came on his own yes, but you used that oppertunity to have him babysit your younger kid on his day off. I agree with your wife that you ought to pay him for that.\n\nWhat was he supposed to do, tell the kid to just leave? You\u2019re the parent and your gave the kid permission without asking Mike if he was cool with it. \n\nAlso there is literally no point in bringing Mike\u2019s day job or what he earns there, unless that is your excuse not to pay him.", "YTA for implying that because he earns $35 p/h, he shouldn\u2019t be paid for his time.", "YTA many of us dream of finding child care sitters who we actually trust to nuture and protect our kids when we're indisposed. Finding primary care is possible. Finding a nurturer is rare. It's a token of appreciation. That's what it is. This person is taking responsibility for your kids and also going out of his way to be supportive in a meaningful way. It's the least you could do.", "NTA - but since you let your son sit with him, I can see why your wife feels the need to pay him. Your babysitter did in fact end up taking care of him even though it was his day off and he was only there to see your other child graduate. I would probably offer him the money, and next time, not let your son sit with him and explain that the time his babysitter isn\u2019t babysitting him is the babysitter\u2019s time and your son should let him enjoy his personal time.", "ESH\n\nI\u2019m kinda conflicted on this one\u2026\n\nNo I don\u2019t think you owe him money. This is not part of his job, he came on his own accord, if your ex felt as though he deserved money just for showing up, she could pay him\n\nBut instead of just allowing your 7 year old to go and be with Mike, you should have asked if he was ok with that. Maybe he didn\u2019t want someone sitting on his lap for the whole evening.

What he makes is none of your business. Just because he has a decent job doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s well off or anything.", "NTA.  Mike showed up on his own accord.  He was not \"on the clock\".  Thank him for attending, make sure your 11 year old thanks him for the present, but that is it.

A thank you card would show appreciation.", "YTA - Just give him extra next time he sits for the kids.", "YTA  \nYou sent your kid to go sit with him when he was off the clock, basically pawning off care for your child to someone who already showed up for your other child out of the goodness of his heart. You absolutely should have offered him $20 just for being that nice. He might have refused it, but you're still an asshole for refusing to offer. And your rationale for how he might have felt obligated to be there if you paid him is ridiculous.", "YTA The fact that you think you need to let us know what he makes in his other job to justify your cheapness is beyond pathetic. \" i only had 20$ bills\" What the fuck?? You were actually considering giving him less than 20? in 2023 you thought giving an amount less than 20$ to a babysitter for literally ANYTHING is acceptable?\n\nYou desperately need to get a grip, and stop being a cheap joke. I can't imagine the kind of tipper you are(n't).", "NTA. He wasn\u2019t working, and could have made up an excuse to not go to the graduation if he didn\u2019t want to\n\nEdit: misread the part about your kid going to sit with him. You probably should have gone with your kid to sit with him so this didn\u2019t turn into an impromptu babysitting session", "NAH the lines are a little blurry because your child invited Mike, and he wasn't taking care of your child. Mike wasn't expected to attend but did. Maybe have a conversation with Mike and ask him if you owe him anything for coming to graduation? That'll make sure the relationship isn't soured", "I think you should have given him a $20, however I don't think you're an asshole for not giving him money. Like if it was me I would have given him $20 but I don't know your finances", "You don't have to, but Instead of paying him, why don't you give him a gift or something instead? He wasn't on the clock per se, but it would be a nice gesture to show your appreciation for him going the extra mile.", "This is not the hill to die on. Just pay him 2 hours worth of work and be nice. He showed up to support your kid. Being generous in this case is definitely not gonna hurt you. Soft YTA", "How strange to not appreciate someone who has literally been part of your children\u2019s life for so long the children regard him as a family member even \u2018off the clock\u2019. The fact he didn\u2019t expect anything from you is so irrelevant. YTA.", "He babysat the kid for the ceremony. YTA, pay him.

Sounds like maybe his plans fell through and he decided to show up for the kids. I was thinking he wasn\u2019t paid, so throwing him a $20 seemed weird. I like someone else\u2019s suggestion of giving him something extra like a gift card from the boys as a \u201cthanks for coming\u201d kind of thing, just so he knows you guys appreciated him showing up. But I think paying him as a caretaker for the time at the graduation is unnecessary.", "Where's the interpersonal conflict?  When did anyone accuse you of being an AH? Not sure this belongs here.", "NTA\n\nQuite the opposite, in fact . . . offering him money would have been pretty rude, and indicated that you don't see him as a friend of the family.\n\nI had kids I used to babysit for well into my 20s, partly for the pocket money, but mostly because I adored them. Once or twice they asked their parents to invite me to their birthday parties along with friends and family. Their mum made it clear that I absolutely was NOT obligated, but I was so moved that these little ones wanted me there that of course I showed up. I would have been horrified if their parents had felt like they had to give me money for that.\n\nMike wasn't there to babysit, or for work reasons at all. He was there to show up for your little boy, for whom he clearly has great affection. He was there in a \"friend of the family\" capacity . . . and you don't pay people to be friends of the family. If I'm being honest, your ex wanting to give him money in this instance actually comes off as a bit insulting, because it implies that he CAN'T be a real friend of the family, or of your children . . . that the only reason he could or would show up for them is for cash. Given that he clearly wasn't in it for that, it feels kind of gross to suggest paying him for showing up for a child he care about.", "NTA - but next time he watches the boys, I would slip him something extra inside a Thank You card, filled out and signed by your 11 yo son (you and I both know it will only be scribbles but its the thought).  Not asked for, not expected but still a cool gesture in response to a cool gesture.", "NTA he attended voluntarily, there was no discussion of him being paid to be there.", "So do you ever pay him? Or did you ever pay him? If so how much?", "NTA. He chose to come on his own time, not on the clock babysitting where he should get paid.", "NTA - Mike wasn't on the clock, it would be insulting to offer cash.", "NTA he wasn\u2019t working. He was celebrating with your kid", "NTA... It's an event OUTSIDE of his hours that he volunteered to attend...As a former Nanny I can't tell you how many times I attended unneeded events because I wanted to be there for the kids... no expectation of payment", "lol it's shocking how many people are totally misunderstanding what you wrote. You do pay him for babysitting. He showed up to the kid's thing just to be a good friend. You're NTA, man. I think Mike was just there to be a good guy. He might even be insulted if you tried to pay him. It'd cheapen his good deed.", "NTA. He didn't ask for money. What he makes is irrelevant to this though. It seems like he went to support your kid. He wasn't on the job. If would've been awkward. Sounds like you have a great sitter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
