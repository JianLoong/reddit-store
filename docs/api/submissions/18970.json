I would have been horrified if their parents had felt like they had to give me money for that.\n\nMike wasn't there to babysit, or for work reasons at all. He was there to show up for your little boy, for whom he clearly has great affection. He was there in a \"friend of the family\" capacity . . . and you don't pay people to be friends of the family. If I'm being honest, your ex wanting to give him money in this instance actually comes off as a bit insulting, because it implies that he CAN'T be a real friend of the family, or of your children . . . that the only reason he could or would show up for them is for cash.

You do pay him for babysitting. He showed up to the kid's thing just to be a good friend. You're NTA, man. I think Mike was just there to be a good guy.

Yes Mike loves your kids and was not obligated to come. He likely wasn\u2019t expecting to be paid and might have even rejected payment. However *offering* a little extra in appreciation to someone who is a valued person in your son\u2019s lives who went out of his way to show up for your kid (and ended up watching your 7 yo so you could focus on your 11 yo) would have, imo, been the right thing to do.  \n\nThe amount of money he makes at his day job has literally nothing to do with any of this.", "YTA\n\nHe said he couldn\u2019t come.

You should have offered to pay him, because while he came to support the 11 yo, he ended up entertaining and watching the 7 yo.

Mike could (and very well may have) refuse the money but the *offer* would show that the effort to be there was appreciated.", "I agree with you, this makes the OP an asshhole for throwing this into the equation. This has nothing to do with the situation of paying. It comes off as money-grubbing and makes the seem like they are trying to get away with something, because 'they're making enough money'. \n\nThat all said, the situation is NTA because that is just a normal thing to do. Show up to support the people you care about, in this case Mike. No one expects to be paid for that unless they are an asshole, which doesn't seem to be happening.

The ceremony was long enough to need a bathroom break and all that time he had a kid sitting on him that he had to try and keep quiet. It was probably annoying and uncomfortable on top of the boring that he had already signed up for.\n\nI think offering Mike money when he wasn't there as an employee would be crass, but what they should have done was watch their own kid in the first place.

That way, the onus is on OP, the parent, to parent. Mike wasn't there to work or be a substitute parent. By not asking, OP put Mike in a babysitting position. He, at the very least, needs to offer to pay for not asking and Mike watching the 7yo, and he's the clear AH until he does.", "Sorry wasn't trying to insult you edited for clarity. Was referencing OP and if he assumed it was okay, it makes him the AH. \n\nBased on the saying \"when you assume you make an ass out of you & me\".", "If being factually accurate means using so-called dramatic language then call me Billy Shakes, buddy.\n\nThe question is if OP is an asshole, not how much time Mike spent thinking about it. Get a grip.", ">Such dramatic language for an event that Mike most likely has not thought of.\n\nI think this is the best part too. People are acting as though Mike's sitting at home really upset he watched a kid he's spent 4 years partially raising when attending the other's graduation. \n\nI'm sure a kid he likes was better company than any random family there.\n\nIf Mike wasn't happy with how things went down, it's as simple as him mentioning, \"Hey I didn't mind watching 7yo at graduation, but please give me a heads up if you need babysitting, I was really only able to stop by for a little.\"", "Sheesh that was harsh for no reason. You good?", "Lol always be wary of posts that end with \"be better\" at the end. It's the easiest way to pretend you have morals without actually knowing what they are.", "Cool. You can deal with the crying when I tell your kid no, I don\u2019t want you here. It is called empathy. Also important to have when raising kids, or interacting with people in general.", "I\u2019m not the original person you replied to. I\u2019m not doing any backtracking. Try again!\n\nAnd yes, it is absolutely condescension.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019d do. Or when it\u2019s his birthday give him a generous bonus. I nannied for a few years and the parents always gave me very generous cash bonuses at my bday - I really appreciated it.", "Yes, this is what I'd do.  Guy is clearly going above and beyond.", "This was my thought as well. At least *offer* $20 or whatever and tell him it meant a lot and it was appreciated that he watched/let 7yo sit with him so they didn\u2019t miss anything. He may decline or he may not but I feel like it should at least be offered. In the end, he wasn\u2019t obligated but he *did* go and ended up mostly responsible for one of OPs kids while there. The gesture would be nice.0", "Mike may not have felt empowered to send the kid back. You put people in awkward situations, they're going to act awkwardly or in the interest of the vulnerable in that moment. \n\nI can already tell who all the cheap parents are by how vehemently they support AH OP.", "I definitely wouldn't have sent the kid away either, but I would have been a little annoyed that I would have been stuck essentially working on my day off when I came to celebrate their other kid graduating anyways. It would probably honestly put a damper on going to any future events that I'm not required to, not necessarily stopping me but wouldn't necessarily feel super invited as a guest so much as a potential paid employee.", "Mike came for the 11 year old. He did not come for the 7 year old. Mom should have have told the 7 year old to leave Mike alone as it\u2019s his time off-or at least consult with Mike. Mike is also the one who took the 7 year old to the restroom, during the 11 year olds ceremony that he came to see on his time off.", "Except Mike didn\u2019t expect it, the wife felt it was warranted and that changes the dynamic completely.  They also sent the younger child to sit with him instead of keeping him with them as they should have.  He was off, the child asked to sit with him and they should have said no, go say hi but come back.  The mother acknowledged that they did put him to work by doing that, the dad just thinks he should be able to do that because why? Mike showed up, that doesn\u2019t make sense for him to have to keep up with the other kid because he\u2019s there.", "Exactly and if Mike didn\u2019t want the 7yo to sit with him or take him to the restroom he could have told them to go back to the parents.", "He did perform a service when OP allowed his other child to basically surprise Mike and stay with him the entire time. That turned Mike from a spectator into someone responsible for watching a young child. Mike didn't sit with the family, he didn't approach them when he got there, they saw him in the crowd and took advantage.", "As soon as the parents sent over the 7-year-old for Mike to watch, does it matter whether Mike allowed it or not or was okay with it or not, he was no longer doing something nice, he was in fact providing a service. Keeping the 7-year-old entertained and distracted, even if it was by simply letting him sit on his lap, in order for him to not make a tantrum or a scene during the graduation. Not only that, but that way the parents weren't focused on the 7-year-old that were able to focus 100% on the graduation as well.\n\nAt that point, he is providing the service of watching a child.", "He went to support, not to babysit, seems like you didn't read the last part where he looked after the 7 year old the whole time", "Happy cake day", "You're pretty much devaluing all work involving kids, cus hey, if they like kids, they shouldn't expect to be paid! The parents didn't even ask Mike. I don't know how you reached the conclusion you did tbh..", "I would\u2019ve been offended if money was offered. It would make me think I\u2019m just an employee.", "It was natural for the child to want to go, but not fine for the parents to assume Mike is willing to take care of the child for however long it lasted.", "Decided to show up for a graduation. Chose to sit away from the family.\n\nThis means, not having to take a 7 year old to the bathroom. That is called babysitting!", "There are 2 kids. He showed up to support the 11 year old, not to watch the 7 year old.", "Lol yeah fucking right you are so childish", "This whole exchange made my brain hurt. I\u2019m so confused.", "Edited - actually deleted because i don't even know what ur argument is now or why you even commented lol", "Yep, I babysat during the summers in high school for the same family. I have a summer birthday and I always got my birthday off plus full pay for that day. I really appreciated it.", "It's a bit of a grey area. There was no agreement prior to Mike coming and getting paid for his services especially since parents didn't even know he was coming. If the ex wanted to pay Mike for the services bc he watched the 7yo, then that's something that should've been discussed during the ceremony instead of reacting after the fact. If she didn't have cash, then she could've asked OP to borrow. It seems like miscommunication. I, like OP wouldn't pay a babysitter for coming to my kids ceremony, but then I definitely wouldn't send a younger child for the babysitter to take care of during that time.", "And Mike could have also told the 7yo to go back to their parents if he was bothered by it.", "I've been to events where there's kids & sometimes I'll sit with them or take them to the bathroom etc. Because graduations are boring & it's no big deal. I've never asked or expected compensation for it. The times when I don't wanna be bothered with the kids, I'll just say go sit with your mom. That seems like common sense to me. Unless Mike is a pushover to the 1000th degree, he was perfectly capable of sending the 7yo back at any moment, if he wanted to.", "It sounds like Mike has worked with these kids long enough that I have a hard time believing he can't redirect them. It's not hard to say, \"Hey kiddo, I need a little quiet time now/have a headache/feel a little crowded - how about you sit with mom and dad for a while and I'll make sure to check in at the end of the show.\"\n\nIf you're taking care of a 7 year old, saying \"no\" to him is part of your day-to-day gig. It sounds like he sincerely likes the kids, going off of OP's post, and she works to keep boundaries (telling the kid Mike has a life outside of them). I have a hard time understanding why he'd need to be paid after he made a conscious choice not to send the kid back.\n\nI know this sub leans hard toward the childfree crowd, and that's inevitably going to color how people view these situations. That's not always bad! But it's important to remember that not everyone views time with kids as a burden, and that going in with that default assumption can lead to some pretty uncharitable views of everyone involved. (Mom's entitled/Mike's a doormat/kid's a monster, vs. the more likely nuanced answer that Mike was tired but chose to come because he cares about the kids, Mom trusted Mike to speak up, and Mike chose not to because he could deal with the 7 year old).", "I didn\u2019t realize that Mike isn\u2019t an adult who can tell said child to go back to their parents at any time during the ceremony \ud83e\udd14 at least, in the case that he did have a problem with it.", "Or he's thinking about how the kid might feel if sent away by a care taker he loves. I've seen parents use and abuse the genuine love sitters or nanny's have for their kids to get unpaid labor.", "The parents are his boss. Not so easy to do.", "And you missed the part where he had the ability to send the kid back.\n\nDid I miss the part where he asked for money?\n\nNope, don\u2019t think I did.\n\nHe wanted to be there.  There was no agreement to pay him for time.  \n\nLet me ask you this:  if some random family comes up to you and says \u201chere, watch my kid\u201d, are you going to say no or just blindly accept it?  \n\nI know I\u2019d say no and if needed walk away.  Because I\u2019m an adult with the ability to adult.\n\nIf I wipe up a table because I see a spill, I\u2019m not going to the owner and saying \u201cpay me because I did work in your establishment\u201d.  \n\nJust like if I work in a bar/restaurant, and I\u2019m hanging out after I\u2019m off the clock, if I help a friend, I know I\u2019m not getting paid unless I\u2019m clocked in.", "You\u2019re pretty much devaluating any form of relationship between non relatives!\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Man, I really wish just this once I was 14 just getting out of school for the summer again.... Sigh", "You are presuming he chose to sit away, you have no idea if that\u2019s actually the case.", "I don't believe things are so cut and dry. He showed up to support the child, and via the child, the whole family. Mike would have been pretty dense to show up thinking he wasn't going to have to interact with the other child.", "There was one today where a mom was found the asshole for wanting to ask the grandparents to come by. \n\nMostly because they needed a 3rd set of hands but also TO SEE THEM. \n\nI can't imagine calling someone entitled simply for asking for help but that happened.", "I saw that one!! I was like, WTF? First, I\u2019d love to hold a baby, and second, it\u2019s not like the baby is interrupting anything (it was a month old).  She wasn\u2019t taking him into a club.", "Yeah, like someone who cares about their kid is going to tell him to get lost.  No, they should have been responsible enough to take charge of their kid.", "Mike is still their employee. It puts him in an awkward position.", "Or maybe they could have kept their 7-year-olds begin with instead of sending them over to the babysitter who wasn't on the clock.", "Exactly. Like the anti-kid feelings on here are very very real.", "For real. Damn.", "He was there for the 11 year old. \n\nYou will note that he did not seek out and sit with the family. \n\nIt is not respectful to send your kids to be supervised by someone else without checking with that person first. When you assume they can just send the kid back, you put them in the awkward position of having to tell a kid that they don\u2019t want to sit with them. That is really not cool.", "The parents aren't entitled to a free sitter just because he decided to show up after the fact. He came to watch one child's event, not to babysit the other. The parents could have gone over with their child, or even sent Mike a text, to see if he was OK with watching the younger sibling during the event. They are the AH's for assuming Mike would be fine babysitting while he was off, when he already took the time out of his own personal life to show up for the event. Obviously he loves the kids, but that doesn't mean he should be responsible for them whenever he's in their vicinity. It was the parents responsibility to make sure he was OK with the situation, and maybe he didn't feel like telling the 7 y/o he didn't want to hang out and hurt the child's feelings. And then potentially have to sit through the event listening to the child cry that they couldn't sit with him. They took advantage of Mike's kindness when they should've made sure he was OK with watching the other child, which is why the mother wants him to be compensated. Mike didn't ask for compensation.", "We assume but it's probably a good assumption.", "How do you know?", "I also don\u2019t think he assumed he\u2019d be supervising the child through the whole ceremony either. OP should have checked with him to see if it was ok to send the 7 year old, or just said they\u2019d catch up after.", "Possibly, but he\u2019s also an adult, not a teenager.  Therefore not likely to be desperate enough to keep a PT childcare job by ignoring his needs.   Unless the ex had a separate conversation with Mike requesting he be there, he wasn\u2019t there to earn money.    If they\u2019d known he was coming they likely would have saved a seat."]}
