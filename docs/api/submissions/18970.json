I would have been horrified if their parents had felt like they had to give me money for that.\n\nMike wasn't there to babysit, or for work reasons at all. He was there to show up for your little boy, for whom he clearly has great affection. He was there in a \"friend of the family\" capacity . . . and you don't pay people to be friends of the family. If I'm being honest, your ex wanting to give him money in this instance actually comes off as a bit insulting, because it implies that he CAN'T be a real friend of the family, or of your children . . . that the only reason he could or would show up for them is for cash.

You do pay him for babysitting. He showed up to the kid's thing just to be a good friend. You're NTA, man. I think Mike was just there to be a good guy. He might even be insulted if you tried to pay him. It'd cheapen his good deed.", "NTA. He didn't ask for money. What he makes is irrelevant to this though. It seems like he went to support your kid.

That means you take your child to the bathroom and your child sits on your lap.\n\nBoundaries. Respect.", "I fail to see how that\u2019s financially OPs problem. OP told him he didn\u2019t have to go and Mike said he wasn\u2019t going to go. Seems like Mike did it to himself and knew he would not only see the family and their kids there, but also not get paid", "Fair enough, I understand where you're coming from. Lol no offence, but your username is very appropriate to this discussion", "People seem to ignore the fact that the child could have asked.", "Idk I think it could go either way. But op did tell Mike he didn't have to come and Mike could have sent the kid back over to the parents if he was put out by him. It really depends on the temperament of Mike. Based on the information provided and if it were me, I wouldn't have minded sitting with the kid if I was there any way and given OP has told both the children and Mike that he didn't have to be there, I don't think she's obligated to pay him and tend to agree with the sentiment that paying him would have cheapened his gesture of coming anyway", "They could still even throw in some extra in his next check, just to show some appreciation to this guy who is kind enough to show up when they didn't expect him to because he cares about the kids. And then take care of the other kid when he didn't have to. \n\nThey really shouldn't have let their other kid sit with him the whole time. A quick up to see him and say hi would have been fine. Definitely agree they are the AH here.", "Mike is an adult who can make decisions for himself. He wasn\u2019t pressured into coming to the ceremony. He decided to come in his own time after OP explained to his 11yo that Mike has a personal life outside of babysitting and wasn\u2019t available. \n\nOP explicitly said Mike wasn\u2019t working on Fridays and Mike agreed. It was nice of Mike to come, but he didn\u2019t perform a service for OP because OP didn\u2019t hired his services for that day. It\u2019s not okay for Mike to just show up and expect money for it after they explicitly agreed upon Mike not working on Fridays.", "He showed up because he wanted to.  The dad said he couldn\u2019t make it, and Mike said he wouldn\u2019t be there.\n\nThat\u2019s 100% on Mike for showing up.  If he didn\u2019t want to be there, he simply had to not go.  There was no implication or obligation for him to go.\n\nHe went because he wanted to go.", "Try harder, and try not to project next time.", "Completely agree!", "Ok champ", "Your not a good guesser. Stick to your day job please", "I am 14 and got out of school this summer", "\u201cSummer Reddit\u201d has been a thing since the beginning", "He wasn\u2019t \u201cout and about\u201d he was at a family event as a friend of the family. It was perfectly natural for the other child - to whom the sitter is very attached - to go sit with him. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That person decided to show up at the kids event on his day off.", "Seriously. My god. It's... really something in here.", "Why would babysitter be there on his day off if he didn't want to interact with the kid in his free time? There's no indication that he was there for any other reason", "It\u2019s not about \u201crespect\u201d. When I was at my nephew\u2019s football game and my little niece spent almost the whole bit of it on my lap, I didn\u2019t consider it \u201cbabysitting.\u201d Why? Because the parents were there too. If at any point in time her behavior or anything else got to be too much, or if I just didn\u2019t want to spend the whole time talking about kittens and guinea pigs instead of concentrating on the game, or anything else, then I could just send her back. I wouldn\u2019t consider that even a favor to them, just a good time with my niece. And yeah, any theoretical kids I babysat for who sat with me at a function that I voluntarily showed up would fall in the same category.\n\nIf I was Mike I would be perplexed if the parents had offered pay unless they had mentioned that when they extended the invite.", "I agree with you. I was answering the \"real question\" of why he was there. I don't think it's that big of a mystery", "When the parent sent his other kid to sit with Mike the rest of the ceremony, is when Mike started performing a service for them. If they had kept the other kid with them, and Mike just came to support and give the little guy his present, then of course they don\u2019t owe him anything. But as soon as the parents had Mike take care of the other child, he switched over from just a supportive, voluntary role to a volun-told babysitting role.", "Sorry i lied, i am not 14 and i did not get out of school this summer", "Did the parents ask him if it was ok for their son to sit with him? Did they ask him if he wanted to be responsible for taking him to the bathroom?\n\nYes, children get attached.\n\nLive in babysitters always get screwed over when parents don't respect boundaries and time off.", "Then why didn\u2019t he go and sit with the parents? YTA", "There was one earlier about someone getting chastised for bringing an infant she was watching for a critically injured relative to a family gathering at the cheesecake factory and I believe it's all the same people.\n\nThe cheesecake factory.", "Ah gotcha. The only way I can see it the other way is of the wife asked him to come but I don\u2019t see OP ever saying she did", "What's the point of him even coming if not to interact with the kid? He wasn't babysitting. Parents were there and he could have sent the kid back at anytime. If he was put out by this and too awkward to set his own boundaries that's his own fault. OP and Mike seemed to have an understanding he wasn't coming. Him showing up after the fact doesn't entitle him to anything.", "Gosh maybe the row was filled? This is silly. He wasn\u2019t there to celebrate some other family\u2019s kid\u2019s graduation."]}
