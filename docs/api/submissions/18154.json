Why is it wrong to say wait a moment and point out issues that i see that others dont agree with, and yet i am passive-aggressive because i point out things from my point of view. It's called agreeing to disagree. As for responding quickl,  I am reading things. So forgive me for rocking my sleeping gs and trying for some downtime. \n\nBut no worries, no more responses from me. Have a wonderful day.", "Gate keeping no. Am just saying she keeps saying she is reactive to any dog. After saying she just doesn't like them. Anyone who I have known who is afraid of dogs don't pick and choose when they are reactive. Either it's all the time when around or none. To change your life in comments to avoid dogs even as far as not going outside, then to say, \"But I am ok at friends' houses with their dogs do not mix. To me, that's a red flag. \n\nSo tell me why such a reactive person to dogs is fine at friends but can't even go outside in fear of seeing a dog?\n\nIt's funny how reddit is quick to say she has every right, which she does to quit but not pick up on words that contradict each other. How making sure it's known why she will quit and putting it on a coworker is ok. How making him choose her or his needs is ok. That her health and well being is more important than his in how she handled this. She will make his workplace hostile for him if she quits. The fact that whatever she is doing at friends can even be tried at her workplace. \n\nThere was no discussion with her work about moving her. That its cubicles so she could be moved away as far away and see what accommodations could be made for both. Just I will quit. That puts her suffering as an additional burden onto the coworker who is supposed to be a friend. She just told him the ultimatum instead of even trying to find a solution first.", "You are assuming. Maybe OP is wealthy. The FACT is he said he'd QUIT. Not a notice or research or whatever. I'm pretty sure management would notify EVERYONE for this EXACT reason. Some don't like dogs, some won't be around them, some are horribly allergic. This would've come up eventually. Giving notice of honestly a huge change at a workplace is a given so people can make plans to leave if wanted/needed. People can literally DIE because of dog allergies. If they don't notify the employees and someone has a horrible allergic reaction someone is getting in trouble. They are probably going to announce \"so and so is getting a service animal\" and he'll immediately puts in his notice everyone will know the reason. Let's also not forget with OP's phobia a dog will DEFINITELY affect how good his work is which could affect possibly a new job.", "He wants everyone else in the office to accommodate him?

Not only is it the responsible and healthy thing to do, it's how people learn and grow past their issues.", "I don't like dogs myself. I'm a cat lover all the way, but that doesn't mean I will go as far as quitting or losing a friendship or family just because someone has a dog. This would be a \"me\" problem. OP needs to fix his issues. The colleague didn't say they were getting a fighting dog that's always eager to go into a fight but a service dog which is probably one of the most well behaved dogs out there. OP's reaction is quite extreme and he needs to... yes, fix it.", "I think in this specific scenario it's a NAH, they both need to do what's best for thenselves.. I think in general OP is an AH to himself for not getting the help he needs in a timely and appropriate manner, ie anytime in the last 23 years.", "I\u2019m asserting (even though you weren\u2019t talking to me), that they both have mental challenges. One of them is working on it. The other one is not. \n\nNeither is an AH but one seems more mature than the other.", ">He has been mitigating this issue\n\nWhich isn't an acceptable long term solution. Putting a bandaid on a gangranous limb may stop you from getting puss all over your clothes, but at some point it will have to be amputated because you didn't treat it. In this case OP will have to give up a job because he didn't work on his issues.", "Getting the service dog is working on his ptsd. The coworker actually is working on his mental health.", "The dog people gonna be dodging that question hardcore.", "But if they have a phobia or an allergy...

Friend is projecting a lot of his fears and insecurities onto OP by assuming their friendship will end if OP finds a new job. It's a valid fear, but getting upset with OP is not an appropriate reaction. \n\nIf the only reaction friend will accept in response to \"Im trying to get a service dog for my PTSD\" is \"oh wow good for you!\" then he is the one being too rigid. \n\nOP said nothing that requires an angry response. He only replied honestly about how this would affect their lives. The friend choosing to respond with anger instead of diplomacy is his own fault, not OP's. Neither PTSD nor insecurity is an excuse for treating people badly.", "I don\u2019t actually have an issue with that, I have an issue with the fact that the poster I replied to said that guy\u2019s mental health issue was real and needed accommodation, but OPs mental health issue is something he needs to get over already.

You are absurdly entitled.", "So no issue being angry with your friend because they have issues that are aggravated by your own needs?\n\nEveryone always has room to grow, I can respect the maturity in the friend addressing his issues and mental health as well as OPs in handling the disagreement like an adult. \n\nThis is an opportunity to learn and grow, or be angry your expectations aren't met.", "Nice assertion", "I'm sure OP can find a new job. At the end of the day it's up to OP. He isn't in the wrong either way.", "to the detriment of his coworker and alleged close friends mental health", "I\u2019m not saying the act of not being around the dog is wrong. Telling a person with a disability that them accessing a medical device will cause you to quit and lose your source of income is hostile.", "But OP CAN be around dogs for full days at a friend's house and \"manage\"... When they're more likely to play aggressively, approach you, be close to you, or attack you if you give them the wrong body language... but not when someone has a well trained, never aggressive, specially procured working dog that would never attack you?", "OP's friends dogs also smell like dogs, pant like dogs, shed hair like dogs...", "So you don't think OP is an AH at all for telling their friend that they'd quit their job if their friend got a service dog for PTSD treatment? I mean I don't see why would someone say that to their friend and make that friend have to choose between getting treatment and keeping a friend, or feel guilty about it. OP could've easily just quietly left if friend did get a service dog and not make it seem like an ultimatum. Personally, I'd rather people, especially a friend, get treatment for whatever their demons are and I wouldn't want to be the one to get in the way of that.\n\nMy vote is either NAH or ESH.", "[removed]", ">Can you explain why you can be at peoples houses who have dogs?\n\nIts a few hours maybe a month at someone elses house while hanging out with friends. And I can generally avoid it and keep my space.   To me that is significantly different than being near one at work for minimum 40 hours a week.", "I think if OP has that significant a problem with it, then he should quit. I think his friend did not anticipate that reaction and was hurt to hear him say he was going to quit. I will not shit on the guy who needs a service dog.", "If dude with PTSD is getting a service dog, he has been in treatment for said PTSD for a decent chunk of time. OP, on the other hand, has not attempted to work through his issues whatsoever in over 20 years. It's about effort. The guy with PTSD is putting measures in to cope with his mental illness thanks to treatment, while OP is just running from his unaddressed phobia. That makes all the difference.", "Again, no one is telling OP he needs to like dogs, simply tolerate their presence in a neutral space. Service dogs are allowed everywhere, including airplanes, an enclosed and very tight space. All dogs are allowed on public transportation where I live. What will OP do in that scenario?
