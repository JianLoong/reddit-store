Today my wife wanted to watch the new episode of keeping up with the kardashians and she wanted me to watch it with her.  I told her that\u2019s fine if she wants to put it on the tv in our room, but I don\u2019t have any particular interest in watching the show and I\u2019d probably just play on my phone while she watched.  She got upset with me and says she watches the shows that I want to watch even if she doesn\u2019t find them interesting because she loves me and enjoys spending quality time together bonding over a show.  I told her that if there was another show we could start I\u2019d happily watch it with her, but I\u2019m not super excited for the kardashians.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s gotten upset with me about not wanting to watch a show.  When house of the dragon came out I started watching it with her and I got through the first 3 episodes and decided I wasn\u2019t really into it and didn\u2019t want to watch it anymore.  She got upset and wanted me to keep watching it and would get mad when I wouldn\u2019t be invested into the show and pulled my phone out.\n\nI personally don\u2019t see why it\u2019s a big deal and we don\u2019t have to like every single show together.

Hopefully she'll come to that realization too.", "It is a soft YTA - she wants to bond with you over something. So strap in and do it.

I think one of the key things here is your partner drifting in and enjoying it, rather than you being like \"I'm watching this, you need to watch with me!\" I think if you tried that, she probably would have enjoyed it a whole lot less.", "[removed]", "I don\u2019t understand your question.", "Second.", "Pretty easy solution to this whole situation.. seek couples therapy or divorce him, you are clearly unhappy in this marriage and no point in dragging it out when it will inevitably end in divorce anyways. You resent your husband, either work to fix that or leave.", "I think it's pretty clear from your comments that you are dealing with a lot of resentment with your husband. Reading between the lines, you take on the majority of the mental load with the household, and are trying to connect with him and spend quality time together. You feel rejected when he doesn't want to share in your interests. You then get resentful, because you partake in his interests to spend time with him and he's not giving you the same effort. \n\nLong story short, I don't think this I about tv, I think your taking on the majority of household tasks, which in itself can cause resentment, and are then feeling rejected when asking your husband to give you attention and spend time together. Commenters here are right, he doesn't have to watch a show he's uninterested in. But again, from what I'm seeing I don't think that actually why your upset. You want your husband to make an effort, to spend time with you, take an interest in your interests, and be present with you. All of that is reasonable.

Both valid points imo \n\nWhy not designate a set of shared shows? Then have your own guilty pleasures, so to speak. My partner and I do this, and it works well for us. This way, no one has to suffer through shows out of love. \"I really love you and I want to be near you, but I don't want to watch this particular show.\" And then I play sudoku on my phone or something, while we snuggle, but my partner is watching the show.

You should just sit her down nicely and explain that you don\u2019t like shows like that, and if she discovers a show that you would both like you would more than love it to watch it with her.

That does have the potential to become more of an issue, it\u2019s healthy to have a good balance of things you genuinely like doing together, things you are content to do together (any may well enjoy more in future) as well as independent hobbies.", "My husband and I have wildly different tv show tastes so we do that separately.

It\u2019s not a fair exchange in any way she flat out refuses to watch most things I\u2019d like to but we always bond over shared hatred for characters  in any trash we watch.

We\u2019ve done the Kardashians for a few episodes it was depressing to watch soo much entitlement and immature behaviour but we had a few laughs and let it fizzle out.\n\nSounds like your partner is quite open so you have a lot of choice to find something you both enjoy if your open to trying things also", "If you can sit down and watch that show you are a better man than me \ud83d\ude02", "NTA", "NTA.

I would love for him to watch em cause ill get invested in games he is playing but its never guna happen. We just have it set up now that he plays his games on a smaller tv whilst i have the main tv for my shows or shows we both enjoy. Yes its annoying but after 11 years i know its never guna change haha!", "NTA. If watching a show together is important to her, you two should try to find something you both like. But you're not required to actively watch a show you don't like. And her expecting that is unreasonable. And being together while she's watches and you're focused on something else is not a bad thing.\n\nOne of my fondest memories of living with roommates: We'd all be in the living room together watching TV but we'd all be on our laptops doing our own thing. And we'd stop to talk or joke around and then go back to our work. But there was something so nice about just enjoying each other's company while still doing our own thing.

Surely you can easily find a show you both enjoy.
