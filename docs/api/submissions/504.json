What about the boundaries you will each set with new partners? Have these been discussed in detail? Obviously not if you haven't already come to a conclusion on how to handle one of you seeing someone the other knows. What about any 3rd parties and their boundaries? Would they want to know if the other partner in the open relationship is someone they know? Are theyre plans to discuss these boundaries?   \n\n\nThere's *a lot* of communication that needs to happen to make a non-monogamous relationship work ethically, including between you and your new partners. It sounds like you and your husband need to sit down and discuss these sort of things more in depth and would be a good idea to do before meeting up with anyone new.", "I think YWBTA for taking an action that you and your husband aren't on the same page about.\n\nI would encourage you to find some relationship or poly subs to present this question to. I don't have experience here, but your situation makes me think there are a lot of angles to take into account and I'm not sure how to ensure that all parties are comfortable with the arrangement.", "The most important thing in an open relationship is communication. If there's something you feel uncomfortable with, you need to talk to your husband about it and work out what your boundaries are.\n\nI wouldn't say you or your husband have an obligation to tell this person, but if you feel like you should, you should explore those feelings to understand why.", "YWBTA because you are going behind your husband's back, communication and trust is critical to this sort of thing.\n\nI would discuss two things with your husband: \n\nIs this a one time thing or more, if onetime I don't think it is necessary to tell old friend but if it is going to be more long term I think it makes sense to tell old friend, otherwise it will be awkward later when they find out.\n\nSecondly if it were me I would want a rule in place about people you two can't agree on should be off the table.", "Wouldn't say ots necessary for the friend to know. Don't see the difference ots make", "What \"social connection\" when you guys aren't even friends or cordial?!\n\nAre you for real?!\n\nYWBTA as it makes no difference.", "I can recommend reading \u201cPolysecure\u201d by Jessica Fern for all things non-monogamy related : )", "Am i reading this wrong?\nAre you asking if it's okay to talk about someone's sexual proclivities without their knowledge?", "YWBTA\n\nYour connections and your husbands connections are between each of you. Put the shoe on the other foot. How would you feel if your husband was to tell a connection you have made, about you and he being married? \n\nIt would be a way of 'controlling' your husbands connection rather than allowing him that freedom and respect to explore on his own.", "NAH Doesn\u2019t make a difference if he knows or not, but maybe talk about not sleeping with anyone that you/ your partner knows if it makes you uncomfortable", "ESH, there's no good that comes from this.", "NAH - I understand why you might want to inform him, however it can come off as a form of you trying to keep \"ownership\". I would only say its nessecary for him to know if they meet up several times. Like ot would be weird for him to purposely keep it from the other man.\n\nHowever, he doesnt need to know. When it comes to sexual encounters, its just change. Hes still your husband, and he loves you, but the two of you are consentually sleeping around and all the others need to know is the truth, however slowly it comes to light. Lying to sexual partner very bad. Not correcting them is a sticky grey area that could lead to some hurt feelings.", "INFO: what is your goal here?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have to set a million new explicitly communicated boundaries when you open a relationship and it doesn't sound like you've done that work yet.", "Thank you, this has given me strong talking points to discuss and think about.", "Thank you! I might be over thinking it but it\u2019s so early on in our journey.", "We went to school together and used to be close to me. Friend was also close to other parts of my family and may or may not still be in contact with a sibling of mine.", "Thank you for your input. I\u2019m not uncomfortable with him sleeping with someone I know. I\u2019m worried Friend will react poorly to finding out he slept with specifically MY husband. Maybe I\u2019m trying to protect Friend\u2019s feelings when he should be worrying about himself?", "I\u2019m not sure what you mean?", "To ensure consent not only with husband but to insure Friend fully understands what they\u2019re consenting to. If that makes sense?", "I saw in another comment you mentioned you would be uncomfortable with him sleeping with someone you know. This is something that also needs to be discussed, these sort of boundaries need to be made clear and you have to be able to have open discussions with your husband about them. Otherwise someone will overstep a boundary somewhere - and they might not have even known it was a boundary - and the results can be catastrophic to a relationship.", "Possibly, might come up naturally in any case but I don't believe there's any benefit to making a point of it haha. No problem", "Understandable - but as you\u2019ve just started to explore an open relationship it may help to have those rules for now as you navigate this. \nBut I also think you shouldn\u2019t tell the old friend, he\u2019s an adult who\u2019s consenting to being with someone in an open relationship so it doesn\u2019t really matter. Would be a different story if he were closer to you.", "If you out him you're the asshole for outing the whole open relationship thing without your husband's consent and dragging an innocent party into y'all's drama. \n\nYour husband is TA for pursuing a relationship with someone without telling them \"I'm married in an open relationship. Are you comfortable with this\"\n\nThe friend is innocent in this because he's unaware of the situation. \n\nY'all need to actually sit down and discuss the guidelines on how to approach this. Open relationships are a pain in the ass when theirs no communication or guidelines. Tbh prolly best to leave people you know in the red zone aka off limits. Because you fuck (literally and figuratively) with someone your already connected with and it ends badly it can and often will bleed into other parts of the friend group.\n\nYou don't need to say a word. You should NOT be saying a word. That is your husband's job to be up front and honest with any partner he has. If he doesn't he's an asshole. All parties need to be aware he's a married man open relationship or not. Not everyone will be comfortable with sleeping with a married man regardless of open status or not.", "Sorry if there was a misunderstanding, I\u2019m NOT uncomfortable with Husband sleeping with someone I know. I\u2019m uncomfortable with Friend not knowing specifically I, me, am his future encounter\u2019s main partner. Given friend and I were friends in the past.", "Ummm read the post. The person knows he's married and in an open relationship, just not who that is with", "So you want full disclosure to any parties involved of any connections, current or previous, between them and you or your husband, is that correct?\n\nThe sentiment is still the same, it needs to be discussed openly with your husband that this is a boundary for you. \n\nI know there's probably some poly / non-monogamy subreddits hanging around that might be worth checking out. They could offer some insight on how to navigate these conversations, as well as possible boundaries that you might not think about that would be worth discussing before they come up in your relationship.", "Still that's an important piece of information that someone they both know needs to know. He could be uncomfortable with the arrangement if he knows the person he's married to is a former friend. \n\nThe parties involved need to have any information that could change their comfort levels. Which includes knowing \"hey I'm married to OP your former friend\" \n\nIf either gets involved with people that BOTH of them knew them that becomes relevant information to be shared prior to the sexual arrangement beginning.", "I agree with you for the most part. Just pointing out that your reasoning was slightly skewed by a misunderstanding"]}
