I've been married to Bella's mum for five years.

Some places here let you get lobes pierced at 16, some are 18 or with parental consent.

I suspect that Bella would have gone to the cheaper place without telling anyone and potentially risk infection, so I opted to be the one to support her in doing this more safely.\n\n\r  \nI talked to my wife about it, but she just said \"You know I hate that stuff\" and walked out. She's always been anti-piercing. My two girls both have their ears pierced and Bella has openly said she wanted hers done for years, but her mum never let her.\n\n\r  \nBella got her ears pierced on her birthday, she was thrilled, but now her mum thinks I'm an asshole for doing it \"behind her back\". I did tell her I was going to. She thinks because I knew that she was against it, I should have taken that as an answer and that she gets to make the final call because she's Bella's mum.

By all accounts and purposes, your wife didn't expressly forbid it. She just said, \"You know how I feel about it\". She's claiming ignorance but honestly, it sounds like manipulation on her part. From another comment you made, it sounds like a common thing for her.\n2. Bella is 16. While *technically* a minor, she's old enough. Also, I've been to those mall \"free\" piercing places before. Definitely a smart choice to go to a reputable place. I learnt that the hard way myself.", "You are NTA. She is 16 and her mother is controlling her so much that she can\u2019t even get ear piercings? The mom needs to control herself bcs when this kid is out of her home she is going to do whatever she was banned from doing and even worse as a reaction to her controlling mother\u2019s behavior.", "NTA - I let a friend of a friend piece my sensitive chest bits in their kitchen at 15 (like a dumbass) because my parents were dismissive and I knew I could least hide THOSE piercings for sure. \n\nAwful idea and I 0/10 recommend. All was fine and everything but that could\u2019ve gone so wrong.\nHer ears? That\u2019s NOTHING. If she has to find a way to hide something over some weird strict rule she will. And my parents weren\u2019t even strict - I had 8 ear piercings, a navel piercing, pink hair and a septum piercing by 16. \n\n(For anyone thinking I might\u2019ve been a bad kid, I also graduated high school at 16 with straight A\u2019s. Piercings and dyed hair did not make me a bad kid if anyone pulls moral-oral shenanigans)", "Yeah NTA. If she was younger that would be an issue but like you said places near you would let her do it. You actually made sure it was safer and if a higher quality.

It\u2019s a simple ears piercing, not something that easily gets infected or is against policies for work. Also, just because she doesn\u2019t like how they look personally isn\u2019t a good reason.

I would certainly not allow my child to make any large permanent decisions (like, big tattoo or something) at that age but ear piercing? \nIs your wife super controlling in other ways or does she just have a thing about ear piercing and if so why? (Just me being curious, no need to answer of course!)\n\n16 is an age where young people are starting to exercise their autonomy and rightly so. Glad you took her somewhere clean and safe.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If your wife keeps things like this forbidden it\u2019s going to be tattoos at 18. Piercing can come out.  As a poster mention above piercing totally do happen at sleep overs.", "NTA - Bella is old enough to decide these things for herself.\n\nWhen parents are too controlling, kids will often rebel and do exactly what their parents dislike out of spite . . . this is why my siblings and I all chose to get tattoos.", "NTA, as a daughter of a mom who helicoptered my appearance (no piercings etc) it almost sends you into over drive of wanting to do it to the extreme! I wish I had a dad who would have stepped in and let me have my own identity.

Now 6 years later I am very tattooed and dress in the exact opposite style that my mother pushed on me! (Still fitting into societal standards though).

Your wife basically blew you off and walked away without answering you. If it were me, I'd interpret that as \"I want nothing to do with this.\"\n\nKudos to you for ensuring Bella had this done safely.", "NTA\n\nAs you said, she would probably go ahead and get them done at a place with higher risk of infection.\n\nAt 16 she can vote with her feet and there\u2019s not a lot you can do about it so it\u2019s far better to support and guide to safe practices.  \n\nAlso it demonstrates that you are a safe space for her to ask advice or help further down the line, especially if she has put herself in danger (think being drunk at a party and needs to be picked up).", "NTA \n\nBella is 2 years away from being a legal adult and your wife is not allowing her to have autonomy over her body. \n\nShe wasn't asking for a tattoo on her face for crying out loud. I don't like ear piercings either but if my teen kid wanted one, they could have one.", "Even if she was against it, Bella isn't her property and has autonomy ((I don't give a shit if this technically isn't true, Bella is a human being)) \n\nIt's a stupid thing to be against. Bella is happy and got it done the best way possible. You're awesome.", "I\u2019ve never understood how parents feel so entitled to their kids bodies (controlling hairstyles or piercings etc).

You didn\u2019t have to sign any consent as a guardian and she was going to do it either way. You informed her mom and made sure the safer way happened.", "NTA. I\u2019m usually all about respecting the bio parent\u2019s opinions but Bella is 16, not a small child, and her mom didn\u2019t give you any specific reason that she has against her daughter getting her ears pierced. You told her mom that you were going to do it so I\u2019m not sure why it turned into a bigger deal later.", "I mean, you\u2019re right, she absolutely would have either gone to the cheap place or worse, done it herself. NTA, good on ya for saving your daughter from an infected piercing! Had a friend get one and they are NOT fun.

What a great gift you give her for her birthday.  My grandfather pierced my ears and I will always remember that as a special moment.  \n\nYour wife is being ridiculous. You are NTA but she is being one.  Stay Team Bella.  Sounds like she needs a champion!", "NTA.\n\nIf there's a less safe option available that Bella could have taken without parental consent, you absolutely did the right thing.  Bella is old enough that she can make these decisions for herself, and her mother needs to accept that.", "It pains me to say YTA because I 100% agree with you.  But her one legal parent said no.  That should have been the end of it.", "NTA . You told your wife what you were doing, her opinion holds no water when it comes to her almost adult daughter.", "I hate to say it but mom was right. You shouldn't have gone against her wishes, even though ear piercing is pretty common so most don't see it as a big deal. Probably best to apologize to your wife.", "YTA.  If you were worried about Bella getting it done badly and getting an infection, you needed to talk about that with your wife, not circumvent her.  She and/or Bella\u2019s father do get the final say.", "Info: did you have to sign a consent form?", "NTA. \n\nLol, my mum was the opposite, for years she and dad tried to convince me to pierce my ears but I turned it down every time.", "YTA.

Instead of taking her anyway you should have cleared things up and talked with your wife.", "[deleted]", "NTA. She is sixteen", "YTA.\n\nNot because I am against piercings but because the mom (and only legal parent) said no and that should have been the end of it. Do I agree with her? No, mine were allowed any reasonable facial piercing starting at 13 and had their ears done much younger. But she is the only parent who can consent and she did not consent. She has made her feelings clear and you went around her.", "NTA\n\nYou would have been if your wife had actually said no or had a discussion with you.

So YTA.", "To me both you and your wife are somewhat YTA.\n\nYou for making this all about \"I would be Bella's parent if etc., and therefore I get to parent her\". That's obviously a complicated situation and clearly has a lot of emotion involved but you did overstep.\n\nYour focus should have been that Bella is of an age where she gets to legally make these choices, your role is to try and give her the safest option available if she's going to go through with it. That's it. You were also fully aware that your wife didn't like it, and rather than trying to talk with her about her feelings and help her recognise that Bella has agency and providing supportive environments, you're hiding immaturely behind technicalities.\n\nYour wife YTA because she's under the delusion that she gets to control other people's bodies and their choices with them. I had a mum like that and guess what, as soon as I could get piercings without parental consent I got 9 in a year.", "NTA But only because you told her and her response was \"you know I hate that stuff\" and walked out. If she had actually told you no, she did not want you to take her, then you would have been an A H for going against the mother's instructions. But she knew you were going to and she also knew her daughter could just go and do it on her own. If she did not want her daughter to get her ears' pierced then she should have explicitly told you no and then told her daughter no and why she is saying no. If mom had told you no, absolutely do not take her, then yes, you would have been the A H to go against what she said for her child. However, you could have still given the daughter enough money for her birthday to go to a piercing place and instructions that if she were to get piercings she should go to a parlor so as not to get an infection. Also, I get piercing guns are not great, but honestly, you can get an infection no matter what and they really are not that big of a deal.", "NTA. Your wife isn't being realistic and recognizing that Bella would have gone behind her back and done it. I got my daughter's ears done as an infant by her pediatrician. I don't understand the big deal. I also had mine done as an infant by my grandmother.", "You have to be 18 or with a parent to get piercings, so she would not have gone to the teen store and done it anyway.  I know SD wanted them pierced so badly, but you knew that her mom said no and you did it anyway.  You should have tried to help SD by being on her side and arguing with your wife. Then let the SD continue to badger and badger and badger mom until she said yes. Yta.", "ESH. You undermined Bella\u2019s mums authority, & it sounds like you & your wife should\u2019ve had a more in depth conversation about this. However, I see your point in wanting to make sure the piercing was done safely & that you were looking out for her. \nBut in saying that, I think it also depends on how likely Bella would be to rebel & get a risky piercing on her own. She should have been obedient to her mums wishes, until she\u2019s 18 & can do it herself.", "YTA. She's the mom and gets final say. You disrespected her parenting.", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nHer mum said no.\n\nYou might not agree with it, Bella might not agree with it, and even I might not agree with it but going against the wishes of the other parent is arseholey.\n\nYou could have explained to Bella her mum says no, and all sit down together for a discussion, and if her mum still says no, Bella is old enough to understand that.\n\nYou should've said she can wait til she's 18, or if Bella decided to go against her mum and get it done by herself, accept the consequences of that.\n\nEven though I don't think you came from a place of malice, it's still areholey to go behind the other parents back. You're supposed to be a team. \n\nCos really we're talking about pierced ears, a cosmetic procedure. It's not abuse or anything like that to say no until she's 18, if that's the rules where you live.\n\nWhere I live, a 16 year old can get it done by themselves, and that would be a different conversation. If it was 16 and you drove her there, I'd be inclined to say not the arsehole. But if she needs consent and you gave it against the wishes of her mum...yeah.

There are people who pierce infants' ears and I don't actually think they should be allowed to do it. \n\nI think the age limit should be something like 6 for ear lobes though. By then, a kid is old enough to understand what is happening, say whether they want it done or not and participate in aftercare.", "Damn I got my ears pierced at 13\n, I was so scared and didn\u2019t want to but my\nMom told me I should get it pierced so she convinced me to , I didn\u2019t get earrings as a kid , tbh I can see why my mom didn\u2019t bring up the idea when I was much younger , I would have gotten it infected and I had some problems as a younger kid . I ended up stretching my ears at 15 and hiding it from my mom for two years , she found out when I was 17 when the wind blew my hair away and she told me to get a job \ud83d\ude02I love my mom", ">but I had to write a pros and cons list about why I wanted it done\n\nI'm genuinely curious, what are the pros to having your tongue pierced?", "My daughter wanted to start getting piercings as soon as she was old enough. I helped her research a good studio and went with her; she told me some of her friends were like, \"ohhhh, what did your Mum say?!\"\n\n\"She came with me and paid for it...\"\n\nTo my mind, there are more important things to worry about in life. She'd have had them done regardless, and probably somewhere much less pleasant. Also I got a few in the process...", "Ditto this. Did my nose piercing at 50yo at a tattoo place. Guy was named Tuna. Fabulous.", "I did mine at at the mall when I was a teenager.  I\u2019m all kinds of allergic to anything not stainless steel or high brand metal, so between the shitty job of the mall piercing and the fact I can\u2019t wear hardly anything, my ears have grown back but kinda wonky on the inside.  Not sure I could ever get them pierced again.  Sometimes I would like to, but they always made me so miserable, it\u2019s not worth it.", "chinese food you want a 3 star rating lol\n\nknow any good piercing places in westchester? i don't love the last place i went to", "Infant ear piercing is a kind of rite of passage in some cultures.", "Yeah fair enough, you\u2019re right.", "When my daughter was little (kindergarten age), she asked to have her ears pierced, because some of her little friend were wearing earrings and she, of course, wanted them, too.   \nI'm against earrings in such a young age - little girls and boys are adorable without jewellery, and there always is a risk of infection or accident.   \nSo I just showed her a video on YouTube, how some little girls have their ears pierced. She didn't want it anymore.   \nNow she's a teenager and much more capable of taking proper care of it, so I said, that we will go to the piercer, when she would be 15, if she still would want have earrings.", "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "That's you, someone else in the comments got MRSA from Claire's. Those guns are NOT sterile.", "I apparently \"looked like a boy\" for the first few years of my life, so the obvious solution was to pierce my ears (because the pink frills and bows weren't enough - this was the 80s). I tried stretching them when I was like 15ish, but a friend of mine had 2s and they ripped, that was enough to scare me out of it. I never went bigger than a 12g. I also love your mom, that's a great response to your ear stretching \ud83e\udd23", "Keep in mind I was a kid and it was the 90s. I don't remember the whole thing because I know I stretched it a bit with random stuff, but my main points were:\n\n- no one else at school had it except for one senior boy (I was a freshman) and I wanted to be *different*\n\n- something to keep me occupied (because I was undiagnosed ADHD and at the time wanted something to play with then I was bored)\n\n- help me stop biting my nails (it didn't)\n\n- not as permanent as a tattoo and if I didn't like it I could take it out (I still have it in almost 30 years later)\n\nI don't think she expected me to do it and that I'd lose interest after, but I'm incredibly hard-headed when I set my mind to something.", "I have gotten sensitive to metals as I\u2019ve gotten older. I went from being okay with cheap costume jewelry to only decent quality costume to only silver or gold, and now I can only wear gold. If it\u2019s yellow gold 10k is okay, but for white gold it needs to be 14k. I assume due to a nickel sensitivity.", "I can\u2019t agree with that from personal experience. I had my ears pierced with a gun at 12 and it was quite painful. I took excellent care of them under my mom\u2019s supervision but they just wouldn\u2019t heal properly. I let them grow back and had them done with a needle when I was 18. It was so much easier and they healed up quickly.  I then got another set, then another, then my daith, and my husband is laughing at me because I\u2019m really tempted to get a fourth set done if my friend ever remembers to send me the piercing studs I lent her.", "Speaking from experience, it is far more painful to get pierced with the gun. I chose (as a stupid child) to get both done at once, they at pierced at angles. Whilst they get the job done, they aren't the best choice, that's all people are saying here.", "They aren't fine, I'm glad you had no issues but when my grandma got hers done in her later years the gun style really didn't do a good job and managed to get a really good infection as they swelled a lot and the butterfly back became an issue.  The vast majority of professional piercers will not use guns and if a professional in the field wont use them then there is obviously an issue with them.", "Apart from the infection risk because piercing guns generally aren't/can't be cleaned properly, a lot of the people who use them aren't well-trained. \n\nI've had my lobes done three times each with a gun (at age 6, 12 and 17 and my helix done once (at 16, but it healed over and I had it redone with a needle later)) and the second pair of holes aren't evenly spaced relative to the first. It's only noticeable when I wear earrings that have a large diameter in the first hole, but I wish I had known and been able to get them done correctly by a trained professional instead of a barely-trained teenager. Granted, the third set of holes are places evenly with the second set, so they're also offset a little, but it's not as noticeable because they're even relative to the next hole over.", "Your information is horribly outdated and incorrect. Piercing guns cannot be properly sterilized and harbour bacteria. Infection is far more likely than with a hollow needle. Also, there's no need to turn the piercing. This actually disrupts the healing tissue and makes it take longer.", "Ah, Westchester is a bit far past the point at which I can pull recommendations from friends. I can only get about from maybe middle island to about farmingdale.", "I have a ring in my nose and my wife manages to smush the end stopper bit of the ring into the cartilage on the inside of my nose on a semi regular basis still! Best it stings and makes my eyes water, worst it\u2019s bled a little! \n\nMy wife is one of the clumsiest people you could ever meet and unfortunately my face seems to bear a reasonable brunt of it! Once when I wasn\u2019t expecting it she just hurled a chocolate bar at significant velocity directly at my face, with a look of sheer horror as she became aware the excessive force she had accidentally used as it left her hands. Earlier on in our relationship when we used to cuddle a lot more, because I was always the one to lie on her chest I think she used to drop her phone right on my face nearly once a week. And she just seems to\u2026 grab my nose and squash the end of the ring in to the inside of my nose for\u2026. Reasons?! Like it\u2019s very often really sweet stuff like I\u2019ll say I\u2019ve got terrible sinus pain and she\u2019ll come over and rub that middle bit of my nose lovingly, but quite hard because that can help, and then before I know it she\u2019s forgotten again and slid her fingers down my nose, making me yelp.\n\nShe also just has some kind of subconscious honing beacon for places I\u2019ve hurt (and I dislocate my joints very easily so that\u2019s a pretty common occurrence). Like she likes to show physical affection through just little touches, which resulted in her constantly trying to pat my foot when I broke my ankle and she walked past the chaise lounge bit of the sofa where my foot was up. But it\u2019s not even like she always knows and this is some deliberate behaviour. If I\u2019ve dislocated a finger and not mentioned it (it\u2019s a regular enough occurrence I don\u2019t tell her about every dislocation, and a lot are semi dislocations too) you can be sure that that\u2019s the day she\u2019ll decide to grab my hand and try to do a finger lock/intertwined fingers. She also kinda watches me apply oestrogen to my skin (not paying attention but it bed right next to me) and it doesn\u2019t seem to matter whether I apply it to upper arms/shoulders or thighs/knees she\u2019ll regularly then 5 minutes later go and give that bit a little kiss! \n\nIt\u2019s obviously become a complete running joke at this point.", "And that's a logical reason for piercings in other areas to be treated differently?\n\nOr maybe it's just a reason parents would be willing to give consent for ear piercings? And has nothing to do with if other piercings should be subject to the same rules of fine if the parent consents?", "This list made ma laugh way too hard.\nKudos to you for writing it now and as a teenager.", "Please don\u2019t share studs, even with a friend. You don\u2019t know where the friend has been!", "Just get some little captive bead hoops. One of the perks of having your piercings done with a needle is you get to wear hoops right away (or rather you're recommended to wear hoops for easier cleaning etc).", "Ah ok thanks anyway! The piercing quality here is dismal so I\u2019m always looking for a rec from a knowledgeable person!", "Just that he was there to do so if needed - which OP has stated multiple times!", "OP wrote multiple times that some places require a guardian\u2019s consent if under 18 even-though that wasn\u2019t the legal standard and that he went there in case they needed his verbal consent.\n\nIt\u2019s ear piercing not cosmetic surgery.  Suggesting Claire\u2019s regularly gets people hospitalized from ear piercing is just plain hyperbolic.", "He doesn't say he would misrepresent himself as her legal guardian, just that he was there to support her and make sure she went to a professional place.\n\n\nStepdaughter did not need parental consent to get her ears pierced. OP was being a responsible adult in ensuring she did it safely.", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the standard by any means - just that infection is not a game to play that close to your brain. I ended up with a MRSA infection after going to Claire\u2019s WITH my dad being the one who took me. \n\n12 years later and I\u2019ve been hospitalized multiple times after my immune system got wrecked and I now have regular infections. Stuff sucks.\n\nUltimately, shoulda coulda woulda, but there\u2019s a lot of great call outs and his wife not explicitly saying no and then essentially making things unfair between the siblings, him the bad guy and it not being HIS daughter when it suits her, and realistically refusing the conversation. \n\nI stand on him being NTA and showing that his (step-)daughter can feel supported and know she\u2019ll be treated fairly with her siblings in the future instead of having to make stupid choices and hide things like I did \ud83e\udd37"]}
