I've been married to Bella's mum for five years.

Some places here let you get lobes pierced at 16, some are 18 or with parental consent.

I suspect that Bella would have gone to the cheaper place without telling anyone and potentially risk infection, so I opted to be the one to support her in doing this more safely.\n\n\r  \nI talked to my wife about it, but she just said \"You know I hate that stuff\" and walked out. She's always been anti-piercing. My two girls both have their ears pierced and Bella has openly said she wanted hers done for years, but her mum never let her.\n\n\r  \nBella got her ears pierced on her birthday, she was thrilled, but now her mum thinks I'm an asshole for doing it \"behind her back\". I did tell her I was going to. She thinks because I knew that she was against it, I should have taken that as an answer and that she gets to make the final call because she's Bella's mum. I think Bella would have gone and done it secretly anyway, and thought I was making the better parenting choice.

By all accounts and purposes, your wife didn't expressly forbid it. She just said, \"You know how I feel about it\". She's claiming ignorance but honestly, it sounds like manipulation on her part. From another comment you made, it sounds like a common thing for her.\n2. Bella is 16. While *technically* a minor, she's old enough. Also, I've been to those mall \"free\" piercing places before. Definitely a smart choice to go to a reputable place. I learnt that the hard way myself.", "You are NTA. She is 16 and her mother is controlling her so much that she can\u2019t even get ear piercings? The mom needs to control herself bcs when this kid is out of her home she is going to do whatever she was banned from doing and even worse as a reaction to her controlling mother\u2019s behavior.", "NTA - I let a friend of a friend piece my sensitive chest bits in their kitchen at 15 (like a dumbass) because my parents were dismissive and I knew I could least hide THOSE piercings for sure. \n\nAwful idea and I 0/10 recommend. All was fine and everything but that could\u2019ve gone so wrong.\nHer ears? That\u2019s NOTHING. If she has to find a way to hide something over some weird strict rule she will. And my parents weren\u2019t even strict - I had 8 ear piercings, a navel piercing, pink hair and a septum piercing by 16. \n\n(For anyone thinking I might\u2019ve been a bad kid, I also graduated high school at 16 with straight A\u2019s. Piercings and dyed hair did not make me a bad kid if anyone pulls moral-oral shenanigans)", "Yeah NTA. If she was younger that would be an issue but like you said places near you would let her do it. You actually made sure it was safer and if a higher quality.

It\u2019s a simple ears piercing, not something that easily gets infected or is against policies for work. Also, just because she doesn\u2019t like how they look personally isn\u2019t a good reason.

I would certainly not allow my child to make any large permanent decisions (like, big tattoo or something) at that age but ear piercing? \nIs your wife super controlling in other ways or does she just have a thing about ear piercing and if so why? (Just me being curious, no need to answer of course!)\n\n16 is an age where young people are starting to exercise their autonomy and rightly so. Glad you took her somewhere clean and safe.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If your wife keeps things like this forbidden it\u2019s going to be tattoos at 18. Piercing can come out.  As a poster mention above piercing totally do happen at sleep overs.", "NTA - Bella is old enough to decide these things for herself.\n\nWhen parents are too controlling, kids will often rebel and do exactly what their parents dislike out of spite . . . this is why my siblings and I all chose to get tattoos.", "NTA, as a daughter of a mom who helicoptered my appearance (no piercings etc) it almost sends you into over drive of wanting to do it to the extreme! I wish I had a dad who would have stepped in and let me have my own identity.

Now 6 years later I am very tattooed and dress in the exact opposite style that my mother pushed on me! (Still fitting into societal standards though). I think its important to let teens find their identity with guidance rather than keeping them in a box, I\u2019m glad I did not get heavily pierced under 18, but man my ears were not going to stop me from getting a job!", "NTA// I\u2019m saying this because if you would\u2019ve adopted her you\u2019re probably meant to act as a parent and go equal with all children in your household. If the mother didn\u2019t want you to act as her father adoption wouldn\u2019t have been on the table. \n\nRegardless of any of that, you didn\u2019t even have to sign a consent form.

If it were me, I'd interpret that as \"I want nothing to do with this.\"\n\nKudos to you for ensuring Bella had this done safely.", "NTA\n\nAs you said, she would probably go ahead and get them done at a place with higher risk of infection.\n\nAt 16 she can vote with her feet and there\u2019s not a lot you can do about it so it\u2019s far better to support and guide to safe practices.  \n\nAlso it demonstrates that you are a safe space for her to ask advice or help further down the line, especially if she has put herself in danger (think being drunk at a party and needs to be picked up).", "NTA \n\nBella is 2 years away from being a legal adult and your wife is not allowing her to have autonomy over her body. \n\nShe wasn't asking for a tattoo on her face for crying out loud. I don't like ear piercings either but if my teen kid wanted one, they could have one.", "Even if she was against it, Bella isn't her property and has autonomy ((I don't give a shit if this technically isn't true, Bella is a human being)) \n\nIt's a stupid thing to be against. Bella is happy and got it done the best way possible. You're awesome.", "I\u2019ve never understood how parents feel so entitled to their kids bodies (controlling hairstyles or piercings etc). My parents always let me pick my hairstyles and allowed my grandfather to take me to the jeweller when I was 11 because I wanted to have my ears pierced. \n\nNTA.", "NTA- she\u2019s 16 she can get them done with or without your or her mothers consent anyways, you wanted to do something nice for Bella and you did, that\u2019s all that matters, you\u2019re a great step parent.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t have to sign any consent as a guardian and she was going to do it either way. You informed her mom and made sure the safer way happened.", "NTA. I\u2019m usually all about respecting the bio parent\u2019s opinions but Bella is 16, not a small child, and her mom didn\u2019t give you any specific reason that she has against her daughter getting her ears pierced. You told her mom that you were going to do it so I\u2019m not sure why it turned into a bigger deal later.", "I mean, you\u2019re right, she absolutely would have either gone to the cheap place or worse, done it herself. NTA, good on ya for saving your daughter from an infected piercing! Had a friend get one and they are NOT fun. I understand why her mom is upset, but I think explaining why in private would maybe help?", "Your wife dismissed your discussion in an immature way. \n\nBella is 16, not a baby. \n\nNTA", "Nta and bella will come to your side if you and her mom\nGet divorced once shes 18 because you have her back", "NTA", "I\u2019m glad Bella has you in her life! What a great gift you give her for her birthday.  My grandfather pierced my ears and I will always remember that as a special moment.  \n\nYour wife is being ridiculous. You are NTA but she is being one.  Stay Team Bella.  Sounds like she needs a champion!", "NTA.\n\nIf there's a less safe option available that Bella could have taken without parental consent, you absolutely did the right thing.  Bella is old enough that she can make these decisions for herself, and her mother needs to accept that.", "It pains me to say YTA because I 100% agree with you.  But her one legal parent said no.  That should have been the end of it.", "NTA . You told your wife what you were doing, her opinion holds no water when it comes to her almost adult daughter.", "I hate to say it but mom was right. You shouldn't have gone against her wishes, even though ear piercing is pretty common so most don't see it as a big deal. Probably best to apologize to your wife.", "YTA.  If you were worried about Bella getting it done badly and getting an infection, you needed to talk about that with your wife, not circumvent her.  She and/or Bella\u2019s father do get the final say.", "Info: did you have to sign a consent form?", "NTA. \n\nLol, my mum was the opposite, for years she and dad tried to convince me to pierce my ears but I turned it down every time.", "YTA. I don\u2019t personally see anything wrong with a teen getting their ears pierced but her mom was clearly not on board with it. Instead of taking her anyway you should have cleared things up and talked with your wife.", "Mildly YTA.. Although your heart was in the right place, you still overstepped. You admittedly knew your wife was against it, and her reminding you of how she felt about it was answer enough. \n\nYou should've talked to Bella, explained the dangers of those place, and suggested an alternative. If Bella went ahead with it, then she's old enough to suffer the consequences. \n\nEdit: to add mildly, because you just wanted what was best for Bella", "NTA. She is sixteen", "YTA.\n\nNot because I am against piercings but because the mom (and only legal parent) said no and that should have been the end of it. Do I agree with her? No, mine were allowed any reasonable facial piercing starting at 13 and had their ears done much younger. But she is the only parent who can consent and she did not consent. She has made her feelings clear and you went around her.", "NTA\n\nYou would have been if your wife had actually said no or had a discussion with you.

It\u2019s 100% better to get it done professionally so that they\u2019re done well rather than at a sleepover or some sketchy mall", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t even have to read the post. \n\nShe\u2019s not your kid.", "YTA. You knew your wife did not approve of it but you did it in spite of that.", "When she said \u201cyou know I hate that stuff\u201d that was her saying no. So YTA.", "To me both you and your wife are somewhat YTA.\n\nYou for making this all about \"I would be Bella's parent if etc., and therefore I get to parent her\". That's obviously a complicated situation and clearly has a lot of emotion involved but you did overstep.\n\nYour focus should have been that Bella is of an age where she gets to legally make these choices, your role is to try and give her the safest option available if she's going to go through with it. That's it. You were also fully aware that your wife didn't like it, and rather than trying to talk with her about her feelings and help her recognise that Bella has agency and providing supportive environments, you're hiding immaturely behind technicalities.\n\nYour wife YTA because she's under the delusion that she gets to control other people's bodies and their choices with them. I had a mum like that and guess what, as soon as I could get piercings without parental consent I got 9 in a year.", "NTA But only because you told her and her response was \"you know I hate that stuff\" and walked out. If she had actually told you no, she did not want you to take her, then you would have been an A H for going against the mother's instructions. But she knew you were going to and she also knew her daughter could just go and do it on her own. If she did not want her daughter to get her ears' pierced then she should have explicitly told you no and then told her daughter no and why she is saying no. If mom had told you no, absolutely do not take her, then yes, you would have been the A H to go against what she said for her child. However, you could have still given the daughter enough money for her birthday to go to a piercing place and instructions that if she were to get piercings she should go to a parlor so as not to get an infection. Also, I get piercing guns are not great, but honestly, you can get an infection no matter what and they really are not that big of a deal.", "NTA. Your wife isn't being realistic and recognizing that Bella would have gone behind her back and done it. I got my daughter's ears done as an infant by her pediatrician. I don't understand the big deal. I also had mine done as an infant by my grandmother.", "You have to be 18 or with a parent to get piercings, so she would not have gone to the teen store and done it anyway.  I know SD wanted them pierced so badly, but you knew that her mom said no and you did it anyway.  You should have tried to help SD by being on her side and arguing with your wife. Then let the SD continue to badger and badger and badger mom until she said yes. Yta.", "ESH. You undermined Bella\u2019s mums authority, & it sounds like you & your wife should\u2019ve had a more in depth conversation about this. However, I see your point in wanting to make sure the piercing was done safely & that you were looking out for her. \nBut in saying that, I think it also depends on how likely Bella would be to rebel & get a risky piercing on her own. She should have been obedient to her mums wishes, until she\u2019s 18 & can do it herself.", "YTA. She's the mom and gets final say. You disrespected her parenting.", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nHer mum said no.\n\nYou might not agree with it, Bella might not agree with it, and even I might not agree with it but going against the wishes of the other parent is arseholey.\n\nYou could have explained to Bella her mum says no, and all sit down together for a discussion, and if her mum still says no, Bella is old enough to understand that.\n\nYou should've said she can wait til she's 18, or if Bella decided to go against her mum and get it done by herself, accept the consequences of that.\n\nEven though I don't think you came from a place of malice, it's still areholey to go behind the other parents back. You're supposed to be a team. \n\nCos really we're talking about pierced ears, a cosmetic procedure. It's not abuse or anything like that to say no until she's 18, if that's the rules where you live.\n\nWhere I live, a 16 year old can get it done by themselves, and that would be a different conversation. If it was 16 and you drove her there, I'd be inclined to say not the arsehole. But if she needs consent and you gave it against the wishes of her mum...yeah.

I (17f) wasn\u2019t allowed my ears pierced until I was 15 (after years of begging). The only reason I was allowed is because my dad said I had the rest of my life to be an adult(?), but my aunt (his sister) basically said she\u2019ll just take me and get it done with her. He finally caved. The thing is a lot of things I wasn\u2019t allowed to do that I really want to do now. I\u2019m 18 in two weeks, guess who wants more piercings that I wasn\u2019t allowed and tattoos.", "I would have 100% adopted Bella if her dad would give up custody. He pays no child support, sees her once a year, never calls, etc, so I am functionally Bella's dad. She calls me dad and doesn't see me as a step-parent.\n\nSomething I've noticed is that the girls are \"our\" daughters most of the time, but when there's a conflict Bella is my wife's daughter only so I think that needs further discussion with my wife.", "It's tricky, because I would be her legal parent if her deadbeat dad would give up custody. Her mum didn't even say no, she just refused to talk about it when I tried to explain that Bella was going to get one done anyway. I don't know if there's an option here where I could avoid being an asshole because either I go against what my wife wants, or let my kid make a risky decision where I could have provided better choices.", "This. I think people forget that he isn\u2019t the legal father? But tbh even if he was, you should never go behind the other ones back like that. Even though he is right and the wife is being ridiculous.", "Yeah, probably. If Bella had been younger and this was an issue of helping her do it when her mum said no, I wouldn't have. But she's old enough to legally pierce her ears without either of our input and would have picked the dodgier place because it was cheaper.", "I mentioned in the post, I did try to talk about it with my wife. It was between the option of helping Bella get the piercing done safely, or stepping back and letting her do it herself and she'd deal with the fallout from her mum.", "If this were a younger kid, I'd be inclined to agree.\n\n16yos can consent to a bog-standard ear piercing as far as I'm concerned.

Bella did have to show ID.\n\nHowever I can't 100% say whether that was because it wasn't needed since she was sixteen or if it was because I was clearly an adult accompanying her, which is why I mentioned the variance in rules.", "Yep it should be a joint decision of the parents. If the parents don't agree, she needs to wait until she can consent for herself.\n\nIf OP is concerned about her doing it unsafely, that's something OP needs to talk to his wife about. It is *definitely* going behind her back, whether he told her he was going to do it or not.", "Yeah, you're right. I tried talking to Bella about it, but she was adamant that it was fine because her stepsisters got theirs done. I wanted to give her that same opportunity to get it done at the same place because I don't think she understood the risks and wanted to protect her from that. But I should have gotten her mum on board first.", "Fair enough. Would I have been more or less of an asshole if I'd let Bella go to the cheaper/less safe piercing place because I hadn't stepped in? \n\nI can't see an outcome here where she wasn't going to get a piercing - her mum told her she couldn't but can't exactly stop her.", "She did not, as a matter of fact, say no.", "That's why you should read the posts. Many times, the information provided can change your mind. Reading the post, you'd find out that OP's stepdaughter is 16 and, at some places, can get her ears pierced without parental consent. All OP did was take his stepdaughter to a reputable place instead of one of the places in the mall. This is another part that reading gives you information, OP commented that he didn't have to sign any consent forms.

Teens should be being guided towards being able to make responsible choices in preparation for being a functioning adult, not working on their obedience skills.", "The teen is old enough to legally make that choice, her mom does not get the final say.  And mom needs to step back from being controlling or the first few years after the daughter turns 18 are going to be rough!", "Op has said in comments that he didn't need to consent for her. He just took her and she had to show them ID.", "Two things not to get upset about as a parent - body piercings and hairstyles. \nPick your battles.\nAs a mum and grandmother,  I think you were correct in choosing to get them done properly.

And my friend had constant ear infections for years due to a dodgy piercing in Claires. And I know kids that did their own piercings (1 actually did it in school in science class when the teacher left the room) and they were uneven and often got infected. And just because she has piercings doesn't mean she needs to wear earrings all the time, and if she has long enough hair, the hair covers the ears.

Thankfully no issues other than being wonky.\nShe took it out like immediately, though, because she couldn\u2019t get the jewellery in and got it professionally repierced a few years later", "ohhhh no not Claires jesus", "Right?!", "Tell her you\u2019ll adopt her when she\u2019s 18.

Hope it all goes well.", "Don't beat yourself up OP. There are plenty of commenters sharing their DIY piercing stories when parents tried to stop them. My best friend at the time wasn't any different, she decided to do it for herself (ended up with 10 extra earrings) and I was there helping her because we were little idiots (14-15). She was lucky, all of them turned out fine. This resulted in an influx of other teens asking us to get them pierced because their parents won't let them.\n\nI swear, we were so damn lucky nothing bad happened and all of our work ended up fine.\n\nI wouldn't take that gamble in your place either.\n\nAlso, your wife? She's an AH. Odd hairstyles and piercings are reversible if done right.

The mere presence of an adult is not sufficient for consent if a consenting adult is required.", "Then Bella would have had to deal with the consequences of that decision. Or you could have stepped in and one, told your wife ahead of time that Bella planned to do it anyway and two, had a discussion with Bella about what the consequences of going behind her mother's back would be if she chose to go get a piercing as well as the potential for medical issues from such a decision.
