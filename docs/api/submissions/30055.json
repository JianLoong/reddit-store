The only issue is that our next door neighbor has a problem with a tree in our yard because the leaves fall into her yard. It\u2019s fall so isn\u2019t that expected? Leaves fall. She came over last week and explained that she\u2019s having yard work done and the company could cut the tree down, then gave us their card. They said it would cost around $400 to get rid of the tree. My partner and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to cut the tree down because legally, the leaves that fall on her property are not our problem. We JUST moved in, why did she not say this to the past owners? They lived in the house for 10+ years and the tree is easily 50 years old. I refuse to cut it but does that make me a bad neighbor?\n\nEdit: The neighbors are about 70 y/o but their son comes by weekly to help with cutting the lawn and blowing the leaves.

I\u2019m sure other trees from other yards contribute to the leaves in her yard too.", "First, congrats on the house and the move!\n\nYou're under no obligation to cut down that tree just because your neighbor hates the leaves.  I have no trees in my back yard but get large oak leaves and palm fronds from neighbor trees all of the time, especially during heavy storms.  that's just part of life in suburbia.  I rake them up or just mow over them for free mulch for my grass.\n\nNTA", "Given how crazy people can be (there\u2019s a lot of cases of people cutting down others trees without consent!) I would call the number she gave you for the workers and make it clear they do not have your consent to cut down the tree and that if they need to be on your property for any reason (like cleaning up debris they generate that gets into your yard) they should contact you, and give them your number\n\nAs to why your neighbor is bothering you and didn\u2019t bother the old neighbors\u2014they probably did tell the old neighbors and got told where to shove it", "NTA.  I'm SURE she complained about it to the previous owners, and I'm sure they said what you did!  I'd recommend you check out r/treelaw \\- they'd be interested in weighing in!", "NTA. Other people's trees are just a part of living near other people.", "NTA. If the tree is healthy and not a danger to any structure, it shouldn't be cut down. Trees are very important to the environment.", "NTA Your neighbor shot her best shot. The tree has brothered her for years and the previous owners didn't want to take it down either. If the tree is healthy and it's not located where it can damage you home, you have no reason to cut it down.", ">We JUST moved in, why did she not say this to the past owners?\n\nRest assured, she likely did but they told her no.\n\nYou are NTA - you like the tree? Keep it. Explain to your neighbor that you like it and have no plans on removing it.", "NTA, but you also have to consider all of the issues. If the tree has large limbs hanging over the property line that could cause her problems, she might have legal grounds to ask you to, at the very minimum, trip those limbs off.  \n\n\nI'm not in favor of cutting down trees for no reason, and I know this issue is about leaves. But any tree limbs over the property line that are problematic (dead, broken, etc.) that could become a liability (falling in a storm, falling on her electrical lines, etc.) should be taken seriously.", "NTA. She probably tried to get the last owners to cut it down and they refused. \n\nIf you wanna be super nice and try to be a good neighbor, you could offer to rake the leaves from the tree on her property once a week, but you are absolutely NOT required to do that. Still, it's always good to make nice with neighbors when possible.", "NTA.  \n\n\nHave a yard, rake leaves. That is the rule. If the branches intrude on their property, you are responsible for trimming it, but beyond that... It is just nature.", "NAH.  She asked, you declined. Fair enough.\n\nIf the leaves are falling into her yard from branches that are also overhanging her yard, then typically she has the right to have them trimmed (within reason in terms of possible damage to the tree).\n\nr/treelaw might be a spot for advice here.", "She probably did, they probably refused, it is her responsibility, tell her she can deal or cut the branches that fall over her yard", "NTA\n\nNot your monkey. Not your circus. The neighbors can't do anything about leaves falling in their yard. Let alone require that you pay for the removal. I'd tell them, \"we're fine with the leaves and the tree.\"", "NTA. She's way out of line. Don't cut the tree down, put up a camera that shows the tree and be aware that tree law is a thing and anyone damaging your tree would be liable, say her tree guy \"accidentally\" cut down the tree", "Nta", "You should also paint your house a color they like", "You\u2019re not responsible for those leaves, and I would not even bother helping them clean the leaves to be honest People like that when you give them an inch they take a mile and taking any kind of responsibility with cleaning the leaves it\u2019s only gonna backfire in the end and cause more grief", "Trees gonna tree, and unfortunately, neighbors gonna neighbors. Legally you are good, and practically, you are even better. \n\nNTA", "We have a neighbor who has a big maple tree that dumps leaves in our yard. We mow them and add the mixture to our garden. The neighbor also gives us the leaves that stay on his lawn so we have enough to cover our now empty veggie garden area. If you are into gardening you could offer to reclaim the leaves.", "Our neighbors left and right tried the same when we moved into our new old house. Ignore them. They should be grateful that you have trees that give them shadow in summer. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If you see the yard working company, or else call them; make sure they understand that you are absolutely NOT having the tree cut down. The legal penalties and charges for cutting down someone else's tree are serious; thousands of dollars for a big, old tree. No professional wants to pay that and get a bad reputation. So don't let your neighbors tell them to take your tree.", "NTA \n\nHowever, maybe the leaf clean up is just too much for her, physically or expense wise? Could you offer some support with that? Do most of the branches hang over onto her property? Maybe you could trim some of it back, making it more manageable? There\u2019s probably some leaf trap net or contraption on the market just for this situation, who knows?   \n\n\nThere may be a compromise that will work here. However, call your own arborist to discuss the options, not a landscape company. You will want to have an expert give you the proper advice on this one. Good luck.", "NTA - My wife and I are going through something very similar with our neighbour. Except he's shouted at me on multiple occasions to \"take care of it\". I've trimmed it back a bit and I've checked the laws around trees hanging over other people's property and that's about all I need to do. Turns out that \"take care of it\" to him means cut it down. I won't cut it down. He apparently squabbled with the previous owners for years about it.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nAs first step i say its your tree and yours decision.\n\nSecond step i ask you to be very very carfull with cuting down a tree without checking all local rules and govermental regulations. If the tree is more then 50 years old, it can be given a huge fine when you cut it.\n\nThird step, stay cool and be carefull.", "NTA!!! Make sure the company knows that they aren't to touch the tree though.", "NTA. Fallen leaves are actually good for the environment as they provide winter coverage to bees and other beneficial insects.", "NTA and as long as the tree is healthy and not in the way of anything, I wouldn't even consider cutting it, especially for such a ridiculous reason.", "Your yard, your tree.\n\nUnless it's a dafety issue or violating some city ordinance, NTA", "NTA", "NAH.\n\nLook, I get her...I am your neighbor, your neighbor is me. LOL! Like her, I have no trees that shed leaves in the fall anywhere in my yard, my neighbor across the street has two gigantic trees that shed for *weeks*...*weeks! Why do I gotta go out there to clean up leaves from a tree that is not mine???*\n\nSeriously, your neighbor thought she'd try to reason with you about the tree. It's entirely possible that once you've dealt with tree leaves for a few years you might want to cut it down. She can't demand that you do, but you do need to have some understanding where she's coming from. \n\nMaybe a compromise could be that you could cut back your limbs from any that are directly over her fence? It won't stop the greater problem, but it might help some.", "YTA.  I live in a house surrounded by trees in every single yard and we also have trees.  The amount of time it takes me to clean up leaves is enormous.  It is a ton of work.  It isn't just the yard, it is the roof and gutters too.  Typically, any branches that go into their yard, they can cut so the smart thing to do is offer to have someone cut them or you do it yourself so the tree does not wind up butchered.  They are also older and so you cleaning up the worst of your leaves out of their yard is the right thing to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I find it\u2019s leaves in our front yard. I\u2019m surely not going to go fuss at those neighbors. \n\nYour neighbors are being unreasonable and think that because your are new young homeowners you will cave to them.  I honestly would not even offer to rake their yard that way leads to a ton more complaints and or requests for you do things for them.  That tree has been there for years.  This is not a new thing for them - being told no to cutting the tree down.", "NTA because the tree has just started getting old enough to become proper interesting; and because you are going to offer to help an elderly couple struggling with their garden and the leaves. What a great neighbor you are.", "NTA. Leaves blow in from everywhere. There is no way I would cut down my tree if somebody complained about leaves anywhere. It is a kooky idea.", "Thank you! That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking. We\u2019re a couple that came from an apartment complex so we\u2019re inexperienced home owners.", "She probably nagged the previous owners about it and they blew her off.  She's trying again with the new folks. Offering to sweep the leaves is a nice gesture.  Maybe that will appease her.", "NTA.  Agree 100%.\n\nMy last house had one maple tree in the front, but woods in the back that were not mine.  I had to rake an incredible amount of leaves every year.  But I also got shade from those trees. \n\nYour neighbor can trim branches that are over the property line, but fallen leaves belong to whoever's yard they fall in.", "This reply made me so happy\u2764\ufe0fthank you very much!", "I didn\u2019t even think about that! I\u2019ll be calling the company later today. Thank you for pointing that out!", "If she did that tree law would come into effect and it would be a very expensive lesson.", "I love the tree, it\u2019s a strong oak so I don\u2019t plan to remove it\u2764\ufe0f", "If she was bothered by limbs hanging over her yard I believe she is legally entitled to have those removed\u2014but only the portion in her is yard, not the entire limb\u2014at her cost.", "Yeah, I came here to say the same thing. The previous owners probably looked at her like she had two heads and then went about their lives. Feel free to do the same. NTA", "The tree only drops leaves into their yard, no where near the roof, but I will offer to clean up the leaves falling into their yard. I appreciate your input!!", "Just be careful. We are reading stories here sometimes of neighbors cutting down trees when owners are away. I would make it clear to them that under no circumstances would you cut down the tree. Maybe try a trim if possible?", "Plus that $400 is probably way low.  I had a dead oak tree taken down.  Mature tree probably 4 ft. across at the base and 80 ft. tall.   Cost me $2550.", "Strong oak - so probably been there as long as she has - she must have known there were trees that would grow when she bought her own house right? Ridiculous! NTA", "I agree, that is way low.  We had a dead maple about 3ft base removed. The first quote was $1200. My husband told them they were going to be there anyways to cut 3 of our neighbors trees down, so they did it for $800."]}
