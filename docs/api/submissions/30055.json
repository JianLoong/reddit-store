I\u2019m sure other trees from other yards contribute to the leaves in her yard too.", "First, congrats on the house and the move!\n\nYou're under no obligation to cut down that tree just because your neighbor hates the leaves.  I have no trees in my back yard but get large oak leaves and palm fronds from neighbor trees all of the time, especially during heavy storms.  that's just part of life in suburbia.  I rake them up or just mow over them for free mulch for my grass.\n\nNTA", "Given how crazy people can be (there\u2019s a lot of cases of people cutting down others trees without consent!) I would call the number she gave you for the workers and make it clear they do not have your consent to cut down the tree and that if they need to be on your property for any reason (like cleaning up debris they generate that gets into your yard) they should contact you, and give them your number\n\nAs to why your neighbor is bothering you and didn\u2019t bother the old neighbors\u2014they probably did tell the old neighbors and got told where to shove it", "NTA.  I'm SURE she complained about it to the previous owners, and I'm sure they said what you did!  I'd recommend you check out r/treelaw \\- they'd be interested in weighing in!", "NTA. Other people's trees are just a part of living near other people.", "NTA. If the tree is healthy and not a danger to any structure, it shouldn't be cut down. Trees are very important to the environment.", "NTA Your neighbor shot her best shot. The tree has brothered her for years and the previous owners didn't want to take it down either. If the tree is healthy and it's not located where it can damage you home, you have no reason to cut it down.", ">We JUST moved in, why did she not say this to the past owners?\n\nRest assured, she likely did but they told her no.\n\nYou are NTA - you like the tree? Keep it. Explain to your neighbor that you like it and have no plans on removing it.", "NTA, but you also have to consider all of the issues. If the tree has large limbs hanging over the property line that could cause her problems, she might have legal grounds to ask you to, at the very minimum, trip those limbs off.  \n\n\nI'm not in favor of cutting down trees for no reason, and I know this issue is about leaves. But any tree limbs over the property line that are problematic (dead, broken, etc.) that could become a liability (falling in a storm, falling on her electrical lines, etc.) should be taken seriously.", "NTA. She probably tried to get the last owners to cut it down and they refused. \n\nIf you wanna be super nice and try to be a good neighbor, you could offer to rake the leaves from the tree on her property once a week, but you are absolutely NOT required to do that. Still, it's always good to make nice with neighbors when possible.", "NTA.  \n\n\nHave a yard, rake leaves. That is the rule. If the branches intrude on their property, you are responsible for trimming it, but beyond that... It is just nature.", "NAH.  She asked, you declined. Fair enough.\n\nIf the leaves are falling into her yard from branches that are also overhanging her yard, then typically she has the right to have them trimmed (within reason in terms of possible damage to the tree).\n\nr/treelaw might be a spot for advice here.", "She probably did, they probably refused, it is her responsibility, tell her she can deal or cut the branches that fall over her yard", "NTA\n\nNot your monkey. Not your circus. The neighbors can't do anything about leaves falling in their yard. Let alone require that you pay for the removal. I'd tell them, \"we're fine with the leaves and the tree.\"", "NTA. She's way out of line. Don't cut the tree down, put up a camera that shows the tree and be aware that tree law is a thing and anyone damaging your tree would be liable, say her tree guy \"accidentally\" cut down the tree", "Nta", "You should also paint your house a color they like", "You\u2019re not responsible for those leaves, and I would not even bother helping them clean the leaves to be honest People like that when you give them an inch they take a mile and taking any kind of responsibility with cleaning the leaves it\u2019s only gonna backfire in the end and cause more grief", "Trees gonna tree, and unfortunately, neighbors gonna neighbors. Legally you are good, and practically, you are even better. \n\nNTA", "We have a neighbor who has a big maple tree that dumps leaves in our yard. We mow them and add the mixture to our garden. The neighbor also gives us the leaves that stay on his lawn so we have enough to cover our now empty veggie garden area. If you are into gardening you could offer to reclaim the leaves.", "Our neighbors left and right tried the same when we moved into our new old house. Ignore them. They should be grateful that you have trees that give them shadow in summer. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If you see the yard working company, or else call them; make sure they understand that you are absolutely NOT having the tree cut down. The legal penalties and charges for cutting down someone else's tree are serious; thousands of dollars for a big, old tree. No professional wants to pay that and get a bad reputation. So don't let your neighbors tell them to take your tree.", "NTA \n\nHowever, maybe the leaf clean up is just too much for her, physically or expense wise? Could you offer some support with that? Do most of the branches hang over onto her property? Maybe you could trim some of it back, making it more manageable? There\u2019s probably some leaf trap net or contraption on the market just for this situation, who knows?   \n\n\nThere may be a compromise that will work here. However, call your own arborist to discuss the options, not a landscape company. You will want to have an expert give you the proper advice on this one. Good luck.", "NTA - My wife and I are going through something very similar with our neighbour. Except he's shouted at me on multiple occasions to \"take care of it\". I've trimmed it back a bit and I've checked the laws around trees hanging over other people's property and that's about all I need to do. Turns out that \"take care of it\" to him means cut it down. I won't cut it down. He apparently squabbled with the previous owners for years about it.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nAs first step i say its your tree and yours decision.\n\nSecond step i ask you to be very very carfull with cuting down a tree without checking all local rules and govermental regulations. If the tree is more then 50 years old, it can be given a huge fine when you cut it.\n\nThird step, stay cool and be carefull.", "NTA!!! Make sure the company knows that they aren't to touch the tree though.", "NTA. Fallen leaves are actually good for the environment as they provide winter coverage to bees and other beneficial insects.", "NTA and as long as the tree is healthy and not in the way of anything, I wouldn't even consider cutting it, especially for such a ridiculous reason.", "Your yard, your tree.\n\nUnless it's a dafety issue or violating some city ordinance, NTA", "NTA", "NAH.\n\nLook, I get her...I am your neighbor, your neighbor is me. LOL! Like her, I have no trees that shed leaves in the fall anywhere in my yard, my neighbor across the street has two gigantic trees that shed for *weeks*...*weeks! Why do I gotta go out there to clean up leaves from a tree that is not mine???*\n\nSeriously, your neighbor thought she'd try to reason with you about the tree. It's entirely possible that once you've dealt with tree leaves for a few years you might want to cut it down. She can't demand that you do, but you do need to have some understanding where she's coming from. \n\nMaybe a compromise could be that you could cut back your limbs from any that are directly over her fence? It won't stop the greater problem, but it might help some.", "YTA.  I live in a house surrounded by trees in every single yard and we also have trees.  The amount of time it takes me to clean up leaves is enormous.  It is a ton of work.  It isn't just the yard, it is the roof and gutters too.  Typically, any branches that go into their yard, they can cut so the smart thing to do is offer to have someone cut them or you do it yourself so the tree does not wind up butchered.  They are also older and so you cleaning up the worst of your leaves out of their yard is the right thing to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Turns out she hadn't ever done moss abatement (the moss had been visible from the road for at least 12 years at that point) and was looking for someone to pay for her lack of home maintenance. I told her to pay someone to trim the branches if she didn't like the shade. Oh no, SHE shouldn't pay for other people's home maintenance, it only worked in the opposite direction.
