My mother kinda went off the deep end and dissapeared for a while, and my three half siblings moved in with their dad who lived a few miles from me. My grandmother and mother had a strained relationship for many years, although they're on decent terms now.\n\nRecently my grandmother has had health problems, and she lives in a state where they can put you in assisted living and then foreclose on your house to recoup medical costs. My grandmother reached out to me and said that she wanted me to have the house, and she was going to put me on the deed so the state couldn't foreclose and use the money to pay for her care if she needs it down the road. She had been vocal several years prior that she intended to leave me the house, and my mother and siblings got very upset. \n\nMore context. When my great-grandmother couldn't walk anymore, my mom moved in to help her. She died shortly after, and my mom moved my sibs in with her. She turned it into a hoarder house and absolutely trashed the place. She had agreed to pay taxes on the house in lieu of rent (never did) and my grandma ended up renting another house down the road to allow my mom to live in what was now her house. Eventually grandma got fed up and kicked my mom out of the house and moved herself in.\n\nRecently the subject has come up again. My mom and sibs don't know I'm already on the deed, and my grandma doesn't want to tell them, because she doesn't want them to be bitter and resentful and distant during her waning years. She finds it very upsetting/gauche that they're \"fighting over my stuff like I'm already dead\" instead of respecting her wish to leave me the house. In her mind, I'm more like her son than her grandson, and my mother already trashed the house once. \n\nMore context, my siblings all live in the same state as the house, I live across the country. My mom wants to take the house and then when she dies will it to all 4 of us equally to use as a \"vacation house\". My brother in particular wants the house so he can stay there when he takes ski trips.\n\nMy siblings all already own houses and are married, I rent, and although I'm making a comfortable living, I'm supporting two kids and my partner who is going for her masters and only works 1 night a week. My grandmother knows that if my mom gets the house, it'll just end up being my brothers 4th house and he'll AirBnB it, and use it for ski trips. She really wants me to have it because she knows I could use the boost, and again, to her I'm her son. \n\nMy brother has been texting her asking about the house and what she's going to do, and he's called me to ask if I'd \"do what's right\" and give up the inheritance to be split. I didn't tell him the will won't say anything about the house because it's already in my name.\n\nAITA?

If in the future medical expenses are incurred, who is liable to pay them?

Further, if she put the property entirely in your name, and it was discovered that she did so to avoid paying her debts, the property could be siezed as your grandmother clearly had the intention of not paying said debts.

And if you are able, put up some cameras at Grandma's house and make sure it's secure (especially if she goes into an assisted living situation).

If I was in your situation, but with my siblings and mum (I love and adore my siblings and mum) I would sell the house when it was inherited and equally share the the proceeds-money. But that\u2019s because of my relationships with them, I would want it even. I\u2019m not in your shoes or understand your relationships with your mum and siblings though. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t your grandmother want it to go to your mum and you and siblings equally? Sell the house, profits shared? I understand your the favourite but does she care and love the others?", "NTA. Keep it quiet. When you find out, act surprised and then act like there's nothing anyone can do about it.

Keep that house and limit contact with toxic people in your life!", "NTA! It should be obvious here.

Shiny spine time. \nNTA", "This is something my grandma said as well, she knows splitting 4 ways would be really difficult to navigate. I live 1800 miles away and they all live within 50, so a 4 way split would just be them using the house as a beach house/vacation house while I visit once every 2 years. \n\nAlso my brother already got divorced once, stuff happens, all of a sudden down the road maybe someone's ex owns part of the house my great-great-great grandfather built. \n\nI just want to clarify my mom definitely cares, she's had a lot of issues in her life but in her way she's always tried her best. She's just kinda bitter at my grandma because she feels like she was kind of abandoned (long story, not really what happened but it was a difficult time for them), and also her dad had written her out of his will when they had a falling out, but then they reconciled, and he didn't change his will in time. His farm (where we spent our summers and she grew up) ended up going to a distant cousin who sold it immediately, and that gutted my mom. \n\nSo she's a little primed to take this poorly, unfortunately. I also have no contact with my dad and have likely been written out of his will, but that's like a whoooooooole other long story.", "Joint, not sole. Tbh I really don't think my sibs will be an issue, if it's anyone it'd be my mom, and she wouldn't have the wherewithal to come at it from the legal angle, she'd be more likely to jimmy a lock and take antiques/stuff she wants. Honestly I wouldn't even begrudge her that, I'm sure there are many things that mean a lot to my mom in that house, and I'd want her to have them.\n\nI'm just gonna be firm on the house and property, I grew up there, it's in a very beautiful and desirable neighborhood in my home town, and I see it as an investment in the future. I'll likely rent it out for a few years, maybe do some work on it, buy one of the neighboring lots sometime in the future. For now when it's time I can tap some equity if needed and use the rental income to offset. Maybe I'll retire there someday, who knows.", "This feels a little extreme. I'm perfectly fine with them resenting me and cutting me off if that's their choice, to destroy a lifelong relationship over a house. I can't control them, but I'd never cut off my family completely just because they're bitter, that's their own ish to deal with. I have told my bro and mom though that they can talk to my grandma if they want, it's her decision and business, not mine. \n\nNobody likes being guilted, but I know my tolerance and my boundaries so they can have as much rope as they want to take.", "Spot on!  I tried to be a little less direct in my earlier comment on this!", "Thanks for clarifying and sorry for poorly assuming stuff about the relationship between you and your mom. Wishing the best for y'all! \n\nImo living distance shouldn't matter and granny's idea is still by far the greatest/smartest (and even potentially helpful for you and your family\u2192partner and kids), especially now after considering the historical/emotional value that this house holds. And omg I didn't even think about the divorced ex possibilities, you're so right\ud83e\udd72\n\nHopefully everything turns out well regardless of what happens, and not any sort of splitting-Armageddon ever occurs \ud83e\udd1e", "[deleted]", "Yeah family is an \"F\" word too, they can be bitter all they want but they need to stew in it themselves, not harass you and DEFINITELY not your poor Grandma.", "Yeah, I think she'd be open to moving the property entirely into my name if that was the best way, I've also considered a trust, but I'm unsure how that affects the look-back period on the transfer compared to joint as it is now.", "I think you have a clear handle on the legalities..\n\nBut you asked a relationship question. And here's my take on it: I don't think your grandmother's desire to have no conflict about this can continue until she dies. Your family is already asking. And they're already aware of her intentions. I think it's much cleaner for you emotionally to be clear with them about your own part of this: \"you shouldn't count on the house. If it turns out to be willed to me, I would keep the house.\"\n\nLook they are going to have a much bigger emotional attachment to a house that they feel entitled to and that they're already planning on owning. You will have much less drama/legal battle potential later with clarity now. It shouldn't be a shock and your position shouldn't be a surprise. If they know now, then they will have years to come to terms with losing out on the house.\n\nYour mom in particular needs to be gently brought into reality on this. Don't let her fixate incorrectly on a fantasy. She sounds fragile, and you don't want to outright fight her when she feels abandoned and betrayed after her mother's death and an estate shock.\n\nOnce things get clearer, you can also focus positively on Gran giving important things away.. If she could start that process now (the book Swedish Death Cleaning is great), it will go easier. Plus it's much nicer to gift an heirloom with a memory attached in person rather than leaving the family to scavenge after a death. Maybe you could organize a family special meal where Gran gifts everybody something she wants them to have or tells them what she's giving and puts a tag on it so it's clear for later.\n\nGood luck.", "Cheers, I actually recommended Swedish Death Cleaning to Gma when she started talking about this in earnest. She should do it for her health anyway, she's got a lot of stuff packed in that house and I think she'd enjoy it more if she let go of some things and gave herself some space and clarity. \n\nYou're echoing my conversation with her though, I told her imo it's best to just put this out now before anything grows. Ultimately she still decided she doesn't want them to know and I have to respect that, but every time she texts or calls me about something my mom or brother said regarding the house, I remind her we can just nip it in the bud. Maybe she'll come around, but she's right there with them and I'm across the country (not for no reason...), so she's more central to the issue. \n\nIn her way this might kinda be my \"payment\" for the house, like here kid, I was gonna give it to you anyway, but the least you can do is take the heat for me. I'd do it different but I'll respect the game."]}
