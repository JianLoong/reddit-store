She doesn't like it. She never liked it. She put up with it because she felt your comfort was more important than her own. She's finally figured out that it isn't. It probably took her all this time to get the nerve to finally tell you to cut it out. And imagine how oblivious you must be to your wife's feelings that you couldn't figure out on your own how uncomfortable you were making her.", "NTA, because you didn\u2019t do it intentionally to piss her off\u2026 but worth asking\u2026 did something change?

If that\u2019s the case, then yeah, YTA if you willingly ignored that. \n\nEither way, stop doing it."]}
