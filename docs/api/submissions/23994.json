We never got along as I\u2019ve grown up things have changed but she\u2019s always felt threatened by me. My dad has changed a lot since  Mia and turned his back on me more than ever. I have a chronic illness and I\u2019m admitted often. Mia has made sure my dad doesn\u2019t visit me when I\u2019m in the hospital weeks at time. I give up on him being super present and get he has his kids to worry about now. I have a mom who\u2019s beyond wonderful and while I still love him I don\u2019t need him as much as I did growing up. Recently tho we\u2019ve been ok. I visit here and there and love being around my siblings and step siblings, M(15) and F(12). \n\nMy dad planned a trip for them to go to the beach. My dad insisted I go and spend some quality time with them. I said fine since things have been better and got pretty excited. I get a text from my dad with the details of the flight for them.. he said to book my ticket quick since the seats were filling up and to try and get a window seat since he knew I loved them. I have a part time job and have money saved but I refused to pay. I texted back acting stupid saying just pick any seat I\u2019m not picky. He said \u201cno I\u2019m sorry sweetie I wasn\u2019t clear can you cover your plane ticket\u201d. I showed my mom and she was pissed and called him asking why he can\u2019t pay for me. He said I\u2019m old enough to pay for it and he had enough to pay for since he was paying for everyone else. This man has money so that\u2019s not the issue, money I don\u2019t see but he has it a lot of it. They argued for a long time and he said since I\u2019m more her daughter than his she could pay for it he has 4 kids and his dog of a wife he\u2019s paying for. His step son has a job too so I was confused why I had to pay but he didn\u2019t. Prior to this he told me to pack some extra cash for anything I\u2019d want to eat or shop for that I understand. After they talked he called me and said it\u2019s not him being mean he just has so much on his plate. \n\nThe other night Mia asked if I got my ticket yet and I said no I\u2019m not going. She fakely asked why not and I said I can\u2019t afford it and made a comment about not being as lucky as others to have a sugar daddy to pay for my shit. She told me to watch myself and be lucky I was even invited  and get to stay with them in the Airbnb dad rented (6 bed house). She ttold me to not be an ah to my dad and just ask my mom to pay for it. She clearly didn\u2019t want me there but quickly changed her tone and said my little siblings would love me there and her and my dad could have some time to go out a couple nights since I\u2019m the most responsible \u201cyou\u2019d be a big help\u201d. I called her a bitch and told her I wasn\u2019t going to be her free babysitter but that was a good joke.

I refused to pay for my plane ticket for family trip with my dad and his wife and I also called her a bitch after insinuating I\u2019d be a babysitter on this trip as well. \n2.) I could be considered an asshole for not agreeing to pay for my ticket since I do have the money saved up and my dad already had a lot of other expenses, and calling her a bitch was out of line.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Write a letter to him, and give a copy to your mother, explaining why and then block him until you are an adult and financially independent.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I don\u2019t like your father because he is very comfortable not taking responsibility of you emotionally and financially. You were an afterthought, as if you were a friend/babysitter joining a family trip and not his child. He allowed his imagined money issues to get in the way of him getting the chance to build a better relationship with you. He might regret that in the future, but it\u2019s his loss.\n\nThe reality is that your father is a weak man who wants to be a good father, but lacks the emotional and mental strength and maturity. Your step mom is awful, but she\u2019s only as bad as your father allows her to be. I\u2019d also ask your mother to not discuss your father with you because she might have to talk to him, but she doesn\u2019t have to relay his thoughts or actions to you. \n\nI really think this is best for your mental health and growth. You are totally worthy of love and respect, but you have to learn now to cut out folks who can\u2019t do that for you so you don\u2019t grow up accepting toxicity into your life just to hear they say they love you.\n \nBest of luck!", "If you're in the US, as a minor your father is obligated to provide for you.", "NTA.

I would text back: its obvious that neither of you value me as a person. You just see me as a nuissance or means to get something you want.  Ive accepted that youve chosen to be this way.
