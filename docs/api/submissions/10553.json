You don\u2019t owe that woman a thing.", "It\u2019s his bed that he made with the mistress\u2026let him lay in it. NTA", "This is kind of a tough one. I guess you could say you\u2019re asshole-ish for not saying anything for all that time. However I fully understand why you didn\u2019t. And if she already had the baby before he found out. Sounds to me like once she found out you weren\u2019t gonna tell him, she had close to a year or maybe longer to tell him herself, or have someone else tell him. Her poor planning and lack of communication is not in any way your fault. So I\u2019d say overall, no you\u2019re not the asshole in this situation at all. That\u2019s like if my ex girlfriend cheated on me with another guy, then asked me to tell him she\u2019s pregnant lmaoo, that\u2019s a big fuck NO.", "NTA. I\u2019m assuming he blocked her number and on socials, but there are legal channels she can go through if child support is required. Asking the soon to be ex wife to facilitate isn\u2019t the only way, it was just the easiest (or most malicious) for the ex mistress.", "You could potentially be adversely effecting an innocent baby. That could be considered an asshole move imo.", "NTA. The only one responsible for telling him is her. Why on earth would anyone think that's you're responsibility \ud83e\udd14", "NTA\n\nShe could have found another way to get in touch with him. She was definitely trying to rub salt on that wound for you. None of your business.", "NTA to me. What did she expect getting pregnant with a married guy? Also, not your job to tell your cheating ex.", "YTA. Why make the baby suffer for your bitterness?", "NTA\n\nI get why you don't want to help her.  There's anger there, and honestly, it isn't your problem to solve.", "NTA, you could have passed on the message if just wanted to end the situation, but you have no obligation to.\n\nAnd her decisions are incomprehensible. Why on earth were you her second choice to contact?", "Why didn\u2019t she tell him she was pregnant herself?   But I will say YTa. You don\u2019t owe them anything but knowing a baby will go without is TA thing to do", "YTA.  The baby is totally innocent in all of this, and you denied that child support from his father.", "NTA. Not your circus anymore!", "NAH if she can\u2019t get ahold\nof him she was trying to find an avenue to reach him was it the appropriate one? probably not and honestly she definitely is an AH \nyou weren\u2019t wrong for not wanting to be the messenger \nand your in laws aren\u2019t wrong for being upset it is there grand baby just like your kids are there grand babies maybe you should have at least told them \nas for telling the dad honestly for the childs sake i think you should have but can understand this decision as well. but he has a right to be upset just like his parents do", "NTA\n\nWhy on earth didn\u2019t she just show up at his door? Why would you of all people be the person she expects help from??", "YTA - I agree you owe them nothing. But there is a child\u2019s well-being that was involved.", "He cut her out of his life, im assuming she told her because he blocked her everywhere.", "NO. The cheaters are the assholes for depriving this baby of resources. This is in no way OP's responsibility.", "You're acting like the only way he could know is through her. The woman is an adult and could have gone through him directly, through a lawyer, through social services. It isn't OPs problem.", "OP isn't depriving the baby of anything though. The other woman doesn't need OP in order to file for child support. In fact, OP CAN'T help in that instance - she's essentially any unrelated third party when it comes to this other woman and OP's ex.", ">It takes two people to cheat\n\nOP was neither of the two people cheating so why would she be responsible to pass on information to her cheating spouse?", "This! I can't believe people that think it's okay to force a child to struggle right out the gate because of the actions of their parents.", "Why is that the OP's responsibility?  Should she look up all dead-beat dads who have kids that are not her responsibility?", "OP not telling her ex about this baby in no way lets her ex \"off the hook\" for his responsibility. \n\nThe ex blocking his mistress doesn't prevent said mistress from contacting him or filing for child support. It simply prevents the mistress from messaging/calling him.", "So why is that on her?", "Seriously? It makes no sense that the only way for the mistress to contact the husband was through his soon to be ex. As a poster above said, she could have gone through an attorney, waited for him to be home.... How is this OP's responsibility?", "She has zero responsibility to this infant. This is between the husband and his mistress.", "Absolutely not. Screw this take. OP has NO responsibility here and the infant needing support is none of her concern. Let the cheating dogs figure out their own business. NTA", "Oh please.  If the mother can't afford a lawyer, do you expect the OP to also pay for an attorney so the baby's mother can go to court for child support?  OP didn't deprive the baby of ANYTHING, the mother did. If the baby's mom is adult enough to have a CHILD, she should be adult enough to actually speak to the baby's father. \ud83d\ude44", "Hold up there. \n\nOP has absolutely no LEGAL responsibility in this mess and in NO way did OP deprive the parent or child of support and funding.  That is all on the crappy ex who left without contact and the crappy woman, who knew for MONTHS that she was going to be a mother and was going to want that support and funding.   \n\n\nMomma could have found the ex's parents or friends or boss or contacted a lawyer. Laying this on OP is weak.", "She has zero responsibility for that child. Why on earth is the mistress relying on her?  The mistress is crazy for showing up several times.", "Yeah sorry there is no reason she could not have the conversation with the father herself. If they're all old enough to be out making babies then they're old enough to have the adult conversations surrounding their care. It's absurd she did not go to the father and instead involved everyone else to try to get to him through other means.", "That would be the stuff of r/antiwork legend.", "I love this!", "Wtf is this judgement", "Oh hell no. Why does that responsibility fall on the OP? And not to mention why didn't the AP go to the in-laws in the first place??\n\nNTA", "I don't care about her or her child.", "Who says in this circumstance that they need a relationship? If it's healthier for OP to distance herself, then that is fine and she shouldn't be obligated to stay in it so they can be step-siblings. There are 100 ways that this woman could have told the father. 100 ways less hurtful than going through OP.", "Why does she have to foster this \"future\" relationship?  I certainly wouldn't.  Let the father work with that and his kids on his own time.", "They will?  Why?  And why is that on the OP?", "Are you kidding me with this?  OP has no allegiance to the sidepiece's children.", "To be fair it really isn\u2019t her problem either. Your acting like just because her shit is over that she suddenly has to care about the person her husband cheated on her with? So I get if the kid didn\u2019t ask for it but neither did this woman ask to get cheated on.", "Ummm how is it appropriate to ask for help from the one person she hurt the most in all of this? OP doesn't owe this woman or her child anything. This woman is an adult and should have reached out to the man herself or her own family for assistance. That would be the normal thing to do. Having a child in the picture doesn't mean that OP suddenly needs to put herself in the middle of a toxic situation.", "go to cps or welfare.  Have the father named and put on child support.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHY is any of that the OP's responsibility?  And yes - she did want something from the OP - she wanted the OP to be dragged further into this mess.", "She could have told the cheating ex-husband about the baby directly instead of involving the injured party to this situation. NTA.", "Srsly. Getting Messy Mistress vibes.\n\nIf she needed support that badly, she could have paid to have him served  with paternity papers. A phone call to a process server has a higher guaranteed success rate than a visit with the angry ex-wife. \n\nOP, if your former inlaws bring it up again, you can say you understand if they're disappointed in how they learned about the latest grandchild, but they ought to take it up with either one of the child's parents, as that's their business and not yours. NTA.", "Yep. The mistress just wanted to further hurt OP and rub the pregnancy in her face.", "That's his problem. I didn't try to prevent it... I just wasn't going to be her messenger.", "Which young children?  Apparently he has several.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd WHY would she ever trust him again?", "I don\u2019t like the stay together for the kids approach. I had parents that should have divorced long before they eventually did that stayed together for us kids. It was terrible, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. This guy is both a liar and a cheat I think it would be better for the kids if the mom can one day be happy and not have to put up with that b.s.", "Absolutely not OP's job here.  This woman had a lot of nerve showing up on the doorstep of the family she helped ruin.  Contact the baby daddy, not his ex.", "That\u2019s like blaming the victim of a hit and run for being in the way of a car going the wrong way down a one way street. She shouldn\u2019t have to pay, worry, or even think about their medical bills. Not her problem.", "Why on earth is that her responsiblility?", "Yeah, why not use a lawyer and have them find his address instead of asking the ex wife?", "All the y.t.a.s are acting like going thru OP was literally the only option. Like why couldn't she go to the in-laws in the 1st place just like she eventually did.\n\nBut anyways yeah I agree with you.\n\nNTA", "It's Bat shit crazy the AP didn't go to the in-laws in the first place or at least after trying to get OP to tell the ex for months?? Sorry not sorry but OP is blameless here.", "Why is she going to believe this woman?  I certainly wouldn't believe the mistress no matter what she said.  Not her problem.", "No she didn't!  The MOTHER of the baby didn't tell the father, how the hell does that make OP an asshole?", "That's the baby daddy's job.  Pretty shameful to put that on the ex he ran around on.  She's been through enough without having to manage his (literal) affairs.", "The ex cut off all contact. Mistress hasn\u2019t been able to contact him. OP knows about baby and has contact with ex. Therefore she should have told him.", "It was made clear that all of the contact info available to the mistress was through his former home with ex wife. THAT is the reason. OP only had to relay a message, but chose to be petty and take things out on the woman & child by intentionally withholding communications and critical information. Those are the facts, not in dispute - whether or not we think that makes her an a-hole is the only question.", "Assuming she knew your husband was married, your justified in resenting or not caring what happens to this woman. That's totally fair.\n\nHowever, this baby is innocent. And while you don't have to care about them exactly, the way you phrase that sounds more like resentment towards this baby. If you had no feelings towards this baby whatsoever, you'd presumably pass on a message to its parent to make sure it was taken care of as that costs you nothing. But actually, you want the baby's mom to suffer so you kept the information from ex and his family to screw the mom over. And if an innocent baby is also screwed over and dosen't get what it needs, too bad. You don't care if a baby is harmed so long as you get to watch mistress struggle. And that's letting your anger/hate make you a worse person.\n\nThis baby is your children's sibling. It's the grandchild of the ex-inlaws you want to stay on good terms with. The best thing you could do is take a nicer tack towards this kid. Now, I'm not saying you have to help our your ex's mistress by giving her money or babysitting or anything like that. But you claim you care about your in-laws, right? And they certainly would have wanted to know about their grandchild. (Especially if their grandchild is in a bad situation since mom can't afford them.) Their grandchild's mom was trying to reach them. And you hid their grandchild from them to screw the mom. You are hurting people you claim to care about out of spite. You could have been good to your in-laws back, and you didn't.\n\nUnderstand that if your in-laws are decent people that means being involved in their grandchild's life just like it means siding with you when you were cheated on. If they should help you and your kids, they should help this baby too. And also your children are probably going to want to know their sibling and they are going to resent you if they found out later you hid their sibling from them or kept them away from. Now, it's understandable if seeing the baby is too upsetting for you currently or something. But be honest about that, at least. Tell your in-laws its too painful for you to be around the baby right now and you suggest your ex-husband or them take the kids and see the baby without you. You can use this time to have a nice break to yourself without having to care for small children. Dad/grandparent custody time where you don't care for them is perfect for them to see their half-sibling. However, long term when your in-laws host family events, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter egg hunts, trips etc that your kids should be invited to their other grandkid should be invited to. That kid should not be excluded beacuse of you and you should not be mean to them. And long term your kids may (not for sure) end up caring about their half-sibling and wanting to see them. Please please please don't posion that relationship and sabotage that. \n\nBeing cheated on sucks and is unfair, but so is being the unwanted affair baby. This baby is at least as much of a victim as you are. Try to open your heart up here and act out of kindness instead of anger/hate. You don't have to love this kid, but treat them as nicely as you would any other little kid. When your children grow up they are going to remember how you treated their sibling. Kids often see through parents behavior when older.", "She was hurt by your ex just as much as you were. You're on the same side.", "I mean, this won't look good for OP in custody court - esp if the inlaws are upset. \n\nThis was a dumb, petty and honestly immoral move that she can comfort herself about if she wants, but it didn't help anyone. \n\nHer pettiness hurt a child - so did her husbands and the other woman's actions, but she shouldn't have thrown a baby under the bus for spite.", "It may not be her problem, but that's not the question. She doesn't need to care about the woman to do the right thing and doing the right thing is not based on whether people deserve to be hurt or not. Being hurt also does not mean she is entitled to hurt people back. You may disagree, and that's fine. I think she made a morally wrong decision. \n\nShe also has to co-parent with the ex and her actions will make this much harder, which impacts her own children negatively.", "Passing on a message about something that important is a trivial task. You were petty not to do it.", "Being the messenger,  and telling her how to contact him are rather different.   YTA", "If this question was AITA for slamming the door in the mistress' face, I'd still vote NTA lol. The nerve. S/O to OP for being classier than that.", "The baby daddy she was trying to contact. All she had to do was send a message, not raise the child lol", "But why is it HER responsibility to tell her ex that his mistress is preg?  None of that is on her, and if the mistress could find him before, she can find him now.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow is the OP responsible for the child having on not having anything?", "Again, I don't care about her child or if my in-laws and ex choose to have a relationship with her. That's their business but I'm not sending my children to be around a person like her.", "Nope. The enemy of my enemy does not have to be my friend.", "Ummmm no, woman helped ruin OPs family with ex husband, she has zero obligations to do anything for said woman. Situation sucks but it's not OPs responsibility to help everyone else carry on after her life was turned upside down in no small part to this woman. Just my opinion though.", "We are definitely not on the same side LOL", "She didn't hurt this child because the child isn't her responsibility. The child is the mother's responsibility and as such it was her responsibility to seek help from the appropriate sources.", "All the affair partner had to do was send a message, she could've just messaged him from a different phone or call the father-in-law from the beginning. OP isn't an asshole for not wanting to communicate with her unfaithful ex-husband and the affair partner"]}
