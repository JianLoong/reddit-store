Sounds to me like once she found out you weren\u2019t gonna tell him, she had close to a year or maybe longer to tell him herself, or have someone else tell him. Her poor planning and lack of communication is not in any way your fault. So I\u2019d say overall, no you\u2019re not the asshole in this situation at all.

The MOTHER of the baby didn't tell the father, how the hell does that make OP an asshole?", "That's the baby daddy's job.  Pretty shameful to put that on the ex he ran around on.

Therefore she should have told him.", "It was made clear that all of the contact info available to the mistress was through his former home with ex wife. THAT is the reason. OP only had to relay a message, but chose to be petty and take things out on the woman & child by intentionally withholding communications and critical information. Those are the facts, not in dispute - whether or not we think that makes her an a-hole is the only question.", "Assuming she knew your husband was married, your justified in resenting or not caring what happens to this woman. That's totally fair.\n\nHowever, this baby is innocent. And while you don't have to care about them exactly, the way you phrase that sounds more like resentment towards this baby. If you had no feelings towards this baby whatsoever, you'd presumably pass on a message to its parent to make sure it was taken care of as that costs you nothing. But actually, you want the baby's mom to suffer so you kept the information from ex and his family to screw the mom over. And if an innocent baby is also screwed over and dosen't get what it needs, too bad. You don't care if a baby is harmed so long as you get to watch mistress struggle. And that's letting your anger/hate make you a worse person.\n\nThis baby is your children's sibling. It's the grandchild of the ex-inlaws you want to stay on good terms with. The best thing you could do is take a nicer tack towards this kid. Now, I'm not saying you have to help our your ex's mistress by giving her money or babysitting or anything like that. But you claim you care about your in-laws, right? And they certainly would have wanted to know about their grandchild. (Especially if their grandchild is in a bad situation since mom can't afford them.) Their grandchild's mom was trying to reach them. And you hid their grandchild from them to screw the mom. You are hurting people you claim to care about out of spite. You could have been good to your in-laws back, and you didn't.\n\nUnderstand that if your in-laws are decent people that means being involved in their grandchild's life just like it means siding with you when you were cheated on. If they should help you and your kids, they should help this baby too. And also your children are probably going to want to know their sibling and they are going to resent you if they found out later you hid their sibling from them or kept them away from. Now, it's understandable if seeing the baby is too upsetting for you currently or something. But be honest about that, at least. Tell your in-laws its too painful for you to be around the baby right now and you suggest your ex-husband or them take the kids and see the baby without you. You can use this time to have a nice break to yourself without having to care for small children. Dad/grandparent custody time where you don't care for them is perfect for them to see their half-sibling. However, long term when your in-laws host family events, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter egg hunts, trips etc that your kids should be invited to their other grandkid should be invited to. That kid should not be excluded beacuse of you and you should not be mean to them. And long term your kids may (not for sure) end up caring about their half-sibling and wanting to see them. Please please please don't posion that relationship and sabotage that. \n\nBeing cheated on sucks and is unfair, but so is being the unwanted affair baby. This baby is at least as much of a victim as you are. Try to open your heart up here and act out of kindness instead of anger/hate. You don't have to love this kid, but treat them as nicely as you would any other little kid. When your children grow up they are going to remember how you treated their sibling. Kids often see through parents behavior when older.", "She was hurt by your ex just as much as you were. You're on the same side.", "I mean, this won't look good for OP in custody court - esp if the inlaws are upset. \n\nThis was a dumb, petty and honestly immoral move that she can comfort herself about if she wants, but it didn't help anyone. \n\nHer pettiness hurt a child - so did her husbands and the other woman's actions, but she shouldn't have thrown a baby under the bus for spite.", "It may not be her problem, but that's not the question. She doesn't need to care about the woman to do the right thing and doing the right thing is not based on whether people deserve to be hurt or not. Being hurt also does not mean she is entitled to hurt people back. You may disagree, and that's fine. I think she made a morally wrong decision. \n\nShe also has to co-parent with the ex and her actions will make this much harder, which impacts her own children negatively.", "Passing on a message about something that important is a trivial task. You were petty not to do it.", "Being the messenger,  and telling her how to contact him are rather different.   YTA", "If this question was AITA for slamming the door in the mistress' face, I'd still vote NTA lol. The nerve. S/O to OP for being classier than that.", "The baby daddy she was trying to contact. All she had to do was send a message, not raise the child lol", "But why is it HER responsibility to tell her ex that his mistress is preg?  None of that is on her, and if the mistress could find him before, she can find him now.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow is the OP responsible for the child having on not having anything?", "Again, I don't care about her child or if my in-laws and ex choose to have a relationship with her.

The enemy of my enemy does not have to be my friend.", "Ummmm no, woman helped ruin OPs family with ex husband, she has zero obligations to do anything for said woman. Situation sucks but it's not OPs responsibility to help everyone else carry on after her life was turned upside down in no small part to this woman. Just my opinion though.", "We are definitely not on the same side LOL", "She didn't hurt this child because the child isn't her responsibility. The child is the mother's responsibility and as such it was her responsibility to seek help from the appropriate sources.", "All the affair partner had to do was send a message, she could've just messaged him from a different phone or call the father-in-law from the beginning.

OP is not responsible for this woman or her spawn, she just had her world shattered she doesn\u2019t need the glass rubbed in the wound.", "You're so unserious for this reply.", "Why should she be the go between? There are other channels for letting him know besides getting the injured party involved.", "It sounds like she's taking it out on him plenty.  Did uou read her post?", "OPs husband and mistress made the baby themselves. This is on the husband and mistress. It is not OPs job to ensure that the baby is taken care of.", "So this is supposed to be the op responsibility to play messenger and get them in contact?", "It's not Op's job to be the Messenger man for a homewrecker or a cheater. \nWhat goes on between the two of them is not only their business but also their problem\n\nOp is in no way obligated to help this woman, not even to give a single penny. If she couldn't care for the child herself she shouldn't have had it. Let alone with a married man", "The mistress knew enough to get ahold of the cheaters parents, but still felt it necessary to contact the op to try and have them be the first line of contact? Why should the op help someone who assisted with destroying their marriage", "She's not taking anything out on the baby, she's just removing herself from the situation.  It's not her job to mediate between her cheating spouse and his mistress - mistress can find someone else to pass her messages.", "She doesn\u2019t owe the woman who chose to fuck her husband any favors, regardless of how iNnOcEnT their child is.", "Oh right because neither the AP or the ex considered the already existing children. It\u2019s not OP job to worry about the AP", "That\u2019s not her problem. The mistress needs to find another way to contact him,not by going through her. He cheated so he has to deal with the aftermath.", "The mistress came to THEIR house! She knew all about the wife. Still, if she could get ahold of his father, she didn't need to talk to the ex wife.", "Nah if she found a way to contact his ex wife and father she could find a way to let him know herself. Its not this womans problem at all wether the mistress knew or not but im assuming she knew since she came to this womans house.", "That's an insane take. \n\nWhere is the FATHER of the baby's responsibility in all this?  He is the one who cut off his mistress and apparently ignored whatever communication attempts she made. It is his and only his responsibility to ensure he's not making babies or tending to the babies he makes.", "She didn't endanger anyone. The mistress contacted the in-laws and could have done so sooner but chose to keep harassing OP instead.", "Nah, I'm not buying this at all. The mistress is an independent adult who can, and should, take responsibility for the consequences of her actions and communicate this herself. Reaching out to the wife to ask her to do it is unbelievably rude, almost downright evil imo. OP doesn't owe the mistress shit.", "If she really wanted help she had other routes to take to get in contact with the ex. She kept pestering op just to rub it in her face. The only people that let the child suffer was the child\u2019s parents. Has nothing to do with op", "Nope. The side piece wanted OP to make her life easier by doing a favor for her. OP had no obligation to do so.", "[deleted]", "If the woman could find OP\u2019s in-laws now, she could have reached out to them the first time OP said no. OP has no obligations moral, legal or otherwise to this woman or her child. \n\nI seriously doubt OP was the only way this woman could reach her babydaddy, she was probably the most convenient.", "If only there were some process to obtain support needed for these innocent children through a neutral legal authority so non parties don't have to be pestered.", "Obviously the mistress knew the cheating husband parents, why was it necessary to drag the woman who marriage she ruined into it?", "\"You suck for keeping that from him\" literally no way would this ever be OP's job. You making this into a \"take the higher ground/be the bigger person even though you're the shifted on party\" is a weird take. Lots of people fuck up. It's not the job of the fucked over to handle their trash.", "Absolutely not", "Why is it her job to play secretary for her ex? It has nothing to do with her. Since the woman got in touch with the in-laws she should have done that in the first place not bugged OP.", "How, exactly, is the OP adversely affecting the child?", "Nope, mistress was able to get knocked up by OPS husband without OPs help. Mistress should be able to find him again without OPs help.", "OP has no responsibility or obligations to the child. The home wrecking mother does", "Where in this did she say she was mad at the child? She barely mentioned the baby. She just isnt Willing to help the women who helped break up her marriage. She has no responsibility to help 2 grown adults communicate especially when they were communicating just fine while having a affair.  \n\nNTA", "AP found a way to sleep with a married man I\u2019m sure she\u2019s smart enough to find a way to inform him. She wanted to put the last dagger in op. She owes them nothing.", "So? The side piece\u2019s child isn\u2019t OP\u2019s responsibility.", "Im sure his f-buddy had it.  And if he is blocking the mistress, get CPS after him.  Not anything to do with OP", "No, mistress is for not going through proper channels.", "That is ridiculous.  How is OP punishing a child?", "LMAO nope. It doesn\u2019t matter how iNnOcEnT a child is, the child\u2019s not at all innocent mother isn\u2019t owed anything by OP.", "No - she did nothing to prevent the mistress from contacting the ex.  She just did not help.  big difference.", "Thats exactly what I thought, good on her for not buying into the drama and ignoring them all! not her circus not her monkeys!", "And where I live she could have had him served by the state agency for free. She is being intentionally spiteful, and OP is right to stay well out of it. Not her kid, not her business.", "Absolutely, their son cut off all contact. If I was in her shoes I wouldn't be trying to get involved with the drama HE created. \n\nShe is definitely trying to paint OP as the bad guy while she is the one behaving in creepy and invasive ways. \n\nOP I would let in laws know that you were only respecting the boundaries their son set with his mistress and had no way of knowing if she was telling the truth or is a safe person to have coming to your house where your children are. \n\nProtecting them and yourself is your number one priority. \n\nPlaying couples counselor to your ex and his side piece isn't.", "Bunny-boiler level?", "This. I'm so sick of all the BS that the other woman doesn't owe you anything. Once she finds out he is married and keeps seeing him, she's just as guilty and just as responsible.", "Because if she did that, she wouldn\u2019t get to rub her pregnancy in OP\u2019s face and stir up drama!", "Strong disagree. It\u2019s advised by many therapists to go no contact as much as possible after a relationship split due to infidelity. OP was protecting herself. The mistress made bad decisions, now she gets to deal with the consequences herself.", "If she was able to contact ex\u2019s parents, should could have done that from the beginning and not go through OP.", "Suffering?  really?  Honestly, how is being hard to afford things suffering?  My car is in the shop, and if it can't be fixed I would have to buy another one.  That would suck and cost money that i would then have to take from something else, but it isn't SUFFERING.  (Ppl in Turkey are suffering.)", "who\u2019s responsible? Certainly not the OP, who has zero obligation to help this woman", "She's the one who chose to not inform him, though, via the many other options she had.. The ex wife was not the only person who could inform him.\n\nEdit: I'm really hoping the ex wife got her child support order in first. Her children are the ones she's concerned about.", "Yes, but how could OP know at the time that the child was actually her ex's offspring? For all she knew, the AP could have made it all up to create some drama in OP's life, and I do believe that, although she wasn't probably lying, her priority was not really about the baby's welfare.\n\nAP should/could have used legal resources at her disposal; contacting the babydaddy's EX wife is not one of them.", "So they were only nice to you in hopes that their son wins you back? Or do you think they\u2019re just angry at the situation and are taking it out on you?", "TBH that\u2019s a little shady on their part. If they know about the cheating, baby or not, and still hope for you to forgive him\u2026that\u2019s not ppl looking out for your best interest.", "Oh fuck no, run the hell away, these people are not \u201cwonderful\u201d if they are playing this game. Their son cheated on you, period, even if he hadn\u2019t knocked up his mistress. That love and support for you and your children should be given without the secret expectation that they\u2019ll Parent Trap you in the process of being present in their grandchildren\u2019s lives. JFC, good riddance to them, OP.", "So they\u2019ve only been being nice to you so you\u2019ll take their cheating son back? And now they\u2019re disappointed that you won\u2019t so they don\u2019t care about you anymore? Sounds like you shouldn\u2019t care if they\u2019re mad. They clearly don\u2019t actually care about you. And also NTA. It is not your responsibility to play messenger for your ex\u2019s AP. Her child is also not your responsibility.", "Just to straight up stir drama is the reason why - she even just \u2018had\u2019 to mention how OP was the first person she reached out to and all pikachu face when being blown off? That\u2019s a women who loves and thrives off drama and I feel bad for OP to now having to be attached to that and most likely being labeled the \u2018villain\u2019 despite not being a cheater or a home wrecker. Yikes.", "Exactly she went to OP and said it was the only way was bull, it was just rubbing salt on the wound since mistress wasn\u2019t even chosen in the end. \n\nHow about- going to his parents herself since she obviously knew where leave live. \n\nOr\u2026have a friend call or text his number since he only blocked her number. \n\nOr\u2026served through the courts\n\nOr\u2026letter to his work\n\nThis was done purely to hurt OP and she isn\u2019t her cheating ex\u2019s secretary.", "Yeah, an the mistress got ahold of the FIL so she didn't even need op to play messenger man\n\nAlso what was stopping the mistress from having a friend message him or her making a alt account? \nNothing that's what \nThere is literally 0 reason for the mistress of all people to message OP other than to just be spiteful", "She is not punishing the baby. She is refusing to be a part of a relationship between her ex and the mistress. To assume she has responsibility for a kid she had no involvement in creating is ridiculous. The person punishing the child are the two who created it, unless they get their act together. OP is the one dealing with the pain of learning her ex now has another kid, as a result of cheating on her. She could have yelled at the mistress and said he\u2019ll no, but instead she just didn\u2019t tell him. Far better decision. Let the mistress who made poor decisions figure it out.", "Agreed! We cannot put this all on the mistress. Takes 2 to tango.\n\nIn laws are angry at son for affair. In laws should be even angrier at their son for being irresponsible enough not to use contraception. Or properly use. Not OP. Sounds like the man is a dingus.", "Lol I loved that show \ud83e\udd23", "If she knew your address after he cut contact, that makes me think she's been to your house when you weren't there. That's a big ol' yike from me. NTA.", "That makes sense. Did you give her his new address? Obviously as I already said, you had no obligation, but just for expediency...", "Acc'd to another response, OP said the mistress knew OP would not speak to the ex for her.", "He\u2019s the one who had cut of contact with someone he was sleeping with. What if she needed to tell him about an sti? He should be more responsible. You were the one hurt in this situation. NTA", "NTA then.", "Smh. I would have called to cops or something after the second time she came around.", "Also, NTA then. There are so many ways to contact someone. Blocked your number? Use someone else\u2019s phone. Maybe a family law lawyer\u2019s, for example.", "Or the mistress had no idea the ex was married until after he knocked her up. I mean, we know the ex is good at lying. He's the real AH here.", "Look, I get the N-T-A judgements here and appreciate that OP was in no way obligated to tell her STBX. I understand that the situation sucked, and it likely hurt OP to be repeatedly harassed about this situation.\n\nBut I do think that OP also should accept that the decision was somewhat of an AH one. She limited access of the STBX\u2019s family to the child, and continued to do so even when ex-mistress came claiming to struggle to pay for baby essentials.\n\nJustified, but still an AH.", "Estimated Time of Arrival.", "I think they meant ESH which is Everyone Sucks Here (everyone\u2019s the asshole)", "NTA. The AP did not even need a lawyer. She could contact the local child support office and file the paperwork.", "No, she doesn\u2019t owe the woman anything.  I never said anything about the woman but why would anyone want to stoop so low that an innocent child is left unsupported", "In what way is telling him \"hey answer you fucking baby mama\" during one of those bi weekly visits gonna carve her nuts off? Bruh like your take is toxic af. Also accoeding to OP she literally did try other ways and came to her as a last option. I'm focusing on the kid here, it's why her in laws be pissed too. They obviously don't fuck w their own son's decisions if they were cool w her still. In an act of selfish pettiness she enabled him to dodge his responsibilities and while it may not be her problem that's still makes her an asshole cause her and her ex are not the only humans involved. Please don't reply I don't have time argue w children.", "Because she knew about the situation and her inaction was bad for this child. Sometimes doing nothing makes you TA.", "I know - and perhaps such an agency would make sure the innocent children have health care and food.  \n\nCrazy it all has to come down to OP", "If the mother (ex-mistress) is struggling it's possible OPs soon to be ex husbands financial support could help the child have a better standard of living. The devil is in the details ofcourse and only OP knows if this is a realistic risk. I think the right thing would be to let the ex know regardless. But I like taking the high road.", "It was up the the mistress to get a hold him it's her problem she didn't knock her up", "So we even know this is in the us or are we all just assuming shit to fit a narrative? Maybe where they live this is not an option?", "She literally said she sees him twice a week. They coparent children", "Ah the classic \"Your problems don't matter because there's kids who are hungry in Africa\" strawman, the internet's oldest logical fallacy when it comes to arguments.", "Actually a masterful play when you think about it. Mistress gets to be the victim because big meanie OP didn\u2019t tell her ex husband he\u2019s a new daddy. And she\u2019s figured out how to get in the good graces with his parents. Sounds like OPs ex is in for a world of hurt for 18+ years. Oh well.", "No.", "The ex mistress should sue for child support then. She can use the court system. It\u2019s not on op to unnecessarily be in contact with her ex because the mistress doesn\u2019t use the legal means she has access to", "But again\u2026 reread the post, the ex-AP knew how to contact the ex-husband\u2019s parents, she wanted to involve op for drama and op didn\u2019t play into it. The ex-husband would\u2019ve known forever ago if, after the first time the ex-ap showed up and op told her he\u2019s been kicked out, she contacted his parents. Op has no responsibility to either of them", "I think you are completely wrong.  The child's essentials are not OPs responsibility regardless.  Besides, why should she believe the AP at all?", "Ahhhh, thank you. Genuinely thought there was some totally new judgement that I hadn\u2019t seen before.", "Family court isn\u2019t going to care that she\u2019s not playing messenger for people she doesn\u2019t want to communicate for.", "How specifically was the child harmed?", "Family court isn't gonna do sh*t\nThe responsible people for this baby are mistress and ex husband she owes them nothing. \nIt's not her job. Mistress found a way, she didn't want to do the leg work to find the man that made her pregnant.", "Then don\u2019t reply since I\u2019m a \u201cchild.\u201d Calm down sweetie. The AF can go through the courts to track down the baby daddy or she should\u2019ve contacted the family not go through her. Obviously she didn\u2019t try hard enough. That child is not her problem and nor is she. OP suffered enough she doesn\u2019t need to deal with this anymore. The only people I feel sorry for is the child and OP everyone else is an AH", "Totally disagree.  There is no evidence of the child missing anything at all - just a mom who said she was broke.   Welcome to mom life.\n\nDoing nothing when nothing is required does not make one TA", "That is the problem of the father and AP.  Why is it her responsibility to improve the child's standard of living?  The child apparently has food and shelter.", "No she didn't.  She found a way to do ir, she didn't want to do the leg work...", "That\u2019s why it would be \u201cas much as possible\u201d. She has to interact with him. Keep it bare minimum. The moment she involves herself, she is no longer protecting her mental health.", "so answer the question - how exactly is the infant suffering and how is it OP's fault?", "Because any conscionable person wouldn't act against a child for their parents actions. I've been that child. It didn't largely effect me but it's still not nice.", "She can say everything in a single sentence", "Seriously though - how is the OP actions affecting the child?  It is an infant.  Unless the OP is actively making it harder for AP to find the father, she isn't doing anything.\n\nAin't no village here.", "The mother found out in the end. She didn't want to do the leg work...", "As if it would never come up again? As if he would have no follow up questions?\n\nEx cheated on her. Why should we expect that he would respect her or her boundaries? The moment she opens that door, it\u2019s very difficult to close. \n\nAnd as it\u2019s been mentioned, mistress figured out an alternative way. She didn\u2019t have to go after OP.", "Sending a text isn't a huge amount of labour. We're all human. We're all flawed. I'm just saying what I would like to think I would do in the same situation. That being said I've never been cheated on (to my knowledge). Much less been a victim of infidelity by a husband.", "It's more like the faking audacity of the mistress to try to make this OP'S problem. She got ahold of her husband in the end for me it sounds she  couldn't be bothered to look and tried to bully OP into doing it."]}
