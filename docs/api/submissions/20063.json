Tell them you are no longer able to dog sit as you have other plans.  \n\nIf you do agree to dog sit, find out how much it would cost to kennel the three dogs and make your price close to that.

It's okay to say no to dog-sitting, especially if you don't want to or if it's inconvenient for you. It's also understandable that you don't want to leave your cats alone for an extended period of time. While it's nice that they offer to pay you, it's not fair if it doesn't even cover your expenses. You should explain your situation to your sister and her partner and let them know that you're not able to dog-sit for them as frequently as they're asking. However, if you're willing to help them out on occasion, you could let them know that you're happy to help out every once in a while when it works for you.", "NTA, Honestly, tell them to deal with it themselves and stop relying on you so they can go party. What would they do if they had kids?", "NTA and they should ask people they respect and know to recommend someone responsible who needs a few days out of their housing situation to house- and pet-sit for them.

I totally understand their refusal to board their pets. I do too. That being said, I have one dog with separation anxiety. I don't get to go out evryweekend all weekend because I willingly took on the role of her physical, mental, and emotional health. So I don't travel like I used to. It's exactly as you said op. Pets may not be the life-changing responsibility kids are. But it's still a life changing responsibility. They are not plants(which I even feel guilty for leaving for a few days at a time tbh)", "NTA.\n\ntheir fur babies, their responsibility.\n\nalso, remember, 'no' is a full sentence.\n\njust 'no'.\n\nso no **j**ustifying, no **a**rguments, no **d**efending, no **e**xplanation. no j.a.d.e.! j.a.d.e.-ing opens you up to negotiation until you 'see the error of your way', guilt tripping 'but FaMiLy helps each other' and the other bs people like to use. no thanks!\n\n*next weekend we need you to watch our dogs  --  no  --  but we already have tickets  --  no  --  the flights are booked  --  no  --  but but but  --  no*\n\n*next weekend we need you to watch our dogs  -- i can't i have a date  --  pffft, cancel it, you never get a second date. always a first date person  //  i can't one of my cats is sick  --  they are cats. cats are independent so i expect you at xyz time  // i can't my friends invited me  --  you see them all the time so one time not meeting them will do no harm* \n\nsee the difference?\n\nalso, start drawing the line in the sand and stick to it!\n\notherwise you will be the designated babysitter if / when their 'real' baby arrives. *nibling misses you why don't you come down for the weekend?* sounds harmless but the minute you enter the house they are gone to the spa since sister needs to recover from giving birth 3 months ago.", "NTA\n\n>claims they can\u2019t be boarded in a kennel but won\u2019t give any reasons.\n\n>Also, they offer to pay me but it barely ever covers the gas round trip.\n\nI know why they won't kennel the dogs. They're using you because they can get away with paying you far less than a kennel.", "NTA, tell them to hire a pet sitter if they don\u2019t like kennels. They just don\u2019t want to because it will cost them way more than they pay you.", "You didn't say how they handle you refusing to do so, but if they insist you do it then they should justify why you need to.\n\nSome valid questions might include:\n\nWhat exactly is the issue with having them boarded? Is there anyone closer who could visit?\n\nCould the dogs stay at the residence of someone else?\n\nCats of course handle being left alone a lot better than dogs as a general rule, but I also don't like leaving my cats alone for days at a time either.\n\nYou're totally right about owning dogs. They require more to be properly cared for and I definitely find it irritating when dog owners don't seem to understand what it is they signed up for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA - You really need to raise your rates to make this worthwhile and even then if you don't want to do it, don't do it.  They don't own your time.  Your feeling about having dogs is exactly correct.  Either don't travel or figure out how to make it worthwhile for someone to regularly take care of your dogs.  Your sister and partner sound like new parents who want to pretend they don't have a baby.  In this case, they have dogs and dogs need to be taken care of.", "NTA. You live far away and would have to leave your own pets for a whole weekend. You have your own responsibilities and life, and they can't rely on you to be their dog sitter. There are online services (such as [rover.com](https://rover.com)) that they can use to have a sitter stay in their home with their dogs or to stop by to walk their dogs a few times a day.", "How does the word NO make you an asshole? Sure she'll be mad the first few times - but she'll deal.", "NTA. I mean, far be it from me to tell people how to live their lives, so I won\u2019t say that what they\u2019re doing is frivolous, but when you have dogs you can\u2019t or won\u2019t board, you make tradeoffs. You probably don\u2019t go to weekend long events without the dogs once a month. I have dogs I can\u2019t board. This means I miss a LOT of things I might have otherwise done if I didn\u2019t have any dogs. And if that was a big problem for me, then I should not have dogs.\n\nOP, you are under no obligation to do this at all, let alone monthly. And if you do this, they should be paying you handsomely for 24 hour care. Going rate for a kennel in my area is around $50-60 per day. If I had someone traveling to stay at my house, I should be paying for gas plus food (provided, and/or an option to order in), plus $100/day for being there with the dogs round the clock.", "NTA. Adopting animals means taking on a responsibility for 10-20 years depending on animal and breed. If you as a pet owner cannot safely guarantee that your pets fit into your lifestyle you shouldn't get pets. Tell your sister to board the dogs while they're out gallivanting. No means no.", "NTA\n\nIf they're a couple that keeps traveling and know that they can't being their dog along with them, then they shouldn't have gotten a dog to begging with", "NTA, you shouldn't have to do something you don't want to do, and this does sound like people taking advantage since it's so often.  I have a hard time saying no to my family or friends especially if I don't have a better reason than simply I don't want to, but that's a good enough reason.  You have your own life, and they live 2 hours away.  Why do you have to give up your weekend once a month for them?  I doubt they'd do the same if situation was reversed, but yeah you can say no without being a jerk as long as your don't say no in an AH way lol.    It is there responsibility to care for their dogs not yours.  They just have to look for someone else to watch their dogs, not go out as often, do things where they can take the dogs, or board them.", "NTA. I also would never board my old dog. That being said, I have friends that sit and  that I pay $40 a day. \n\nIt is great for me so I don't have to worry about him and great for them since it's some extra cash. Being you are traveling a distance,  there should be a base pay plus gas. Time to have a conversation with your sister about both the frequency of dog sitting and a negotiated rate.", "Going rate for a kennel is at least $50 per dog per day."]}
