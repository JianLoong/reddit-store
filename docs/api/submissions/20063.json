Your sis is taking advantage of you and the situation, and she is isn\u2019t even compensating you in line with generally accepted practices. \n\nI\u2019d let your sister know that you won\u2019t be able to help her anymore due to your own commitments, and the well-being of your own pets. At the end of the day,  you  have to protect your own priorities, and establish your boundaries, while your sis needs  to reassess whether she is in a place in her life to own animals.", "NTA!!!  two hours away?  No way!  This is ridiciluous!\n\nThey can kennel them or pay for a pet sitter or house sitter to take care of them.\n\nSame for your cats, you can pay for a pet sitter to check in on them.  I know several people that do this as a side hustle or even as their main job and do quite well at it.  The best ones take the time and spend time with your pets playing, petting etc.", "**NTA**\n\nThey\u2019re taking advantage of your generosity. Next time just say no.", "NTA.  Tell them twice a year, tops, starting in 2024.  There are bonded & insured pet sitters all over.", "NTA I travel like once a year, and my sister helps looking after my cats. She always gets paid, and I have the contact to a sitter if she wants to go out. Having pets it\u2019s my responsibility and even when she is the most amazing person ever for taking care of them for me I do not expect her to do it. And I do it like once a year at most twice.", "Never help people with THEIR responsibilities when you don't want to. Whether it's childcare, pet care, moving or whatever. They took on they 3 dogs. Not YOU!", "NTA. I have two dogs and my in-laws watch them 2 or 3 times a year total. One entire weekend a month is far too much. Just say no. They aren't your responsibility unless they officially hire you and pay you a reasonable rate.", "NTA\n\nWe dont like to board our pets either, but are willing to pay a dog sitter to watch them when we go on vacation or take a long day trip.\n\nYour brother should be offering to pay you enough to make it worth your while, not just gas money.", "Charge them the going rate for pet sitting services as well as transportation expenses and reimbursement for your cats sitter since your pets are being left alone while you're fulfilling your \"family obligation\". Their part of the \"family obligation\" is to make sure you are treated fairly & well and that they sincerely appreciate you giving up your personal time to accommodate their monthly get-aways.\n\nThey're taking advantage of you and they know it. I don't board my dogs either, but I don't try to make people feel guilty for not wanting to let me take advantage of them. \n\nOr just say no, and keep saying no till they figure it out. Whichever works for you.", "NTA. I have a dog and I am the same way - I would never board him. I also love to travel. I spent over $2500 on my pet sitter last year alone for my pup. That\u2019s the price you pay when you have a dog - either that or you board them or you don\u2019t travel. You don\u2019t get to dump them off on other people. Stop pet sitting for them. Or you can demand a fair price - I don\u2019t even know much. I pay $30 a night for one dog and that\u2019s in her own home. She doesn\u2019t have to travel. I\u2019d say at least $60/80 a night for three dogs at someone else\u2019s house plus the cost of driving. And if you have to pay for someone to watch your cats - charge for that too.", "NTA.  They sound pushy, I would stop dog sitting permanently, that way it will never be an issue again.  Just a permanent no every time they ask and do not explain your reasons.", "Just say no.\n\nIn my 30ish years as a dog owner, the number of times I have asked family to take care of my dogs is twice. The first I asked about several months in advance. The second time I had arranged for an in-house sitter and she backed out less than 24 hours before my 6 day vacation and I was stuck - so my brother with a fenced backyard graciously took them and his GF took them for walks during lunch.\n\nThree dogs is a horrific ask, especially on a monthly basis. The fact that YOU have to abandon your pets to do so is over the top.", "Sis, train your dogs to babysit themselves. NTA.", ">I feel like having dogs just comes with the commitment and sacrifice to not travel as much, I\u2019ve never had dogs so I don\u2019t really understand.\n\nNo, you understand perfectly.\n\n>Also, they offer to pay me but it barely ever covers the gas round trip.\n\nNot sure where you are, but around here dog boarding starts at 44/night/dog.  Walks are extra.  So unless their offer starts at $132 + transportation costs, it's not adequate.\n\nNTA, of course.  Are they implying you are an a\\*\\*hole for not watching them?\n\nI've had one or two dogs continuously for over 30 years.  Two feels like more than twice the work.  Three would be hard to handle in any kind of exception case, like if two got into a nasty fight.  These people seem like lousy dog owners.", "NTA. Just say no. I honestly can\u2019t even believe that they would ask you given that you live 2 hours away. They sound selfish and cheap! I also think it\u2019s very important for you set this boundary now or they will never cease to take advantage of you, cheap out on you and then try to shame you.", "NTA.\n\nFor specifics, I might read the post later but just know that you are never for any reason be it personal medical meteor strike,\n\nAre you EVER responsible to babysit anyone's animals or children.\n\nThe details really don't matter NTA\n\nNot sure if your sister is an AH but it's very likely considering she asked you to do this.\n\nEdit: couldn't help myself, read it, tell them that it might not sound like work to them but to you it's personally a lot more work than a shift at a restaurant so I think they should start at 18 an hour, but you're under no obligation if they offer a grand an hour\n\n\nIf you wanted animals you'd get your own, they're not hard to find are they?\n\nNo. Sister is AH.", "Tell them to either stay in , pay a reasonable fee or use someone else Nta stick with your pets your right they are asking you to leave your own animals to care for there\u2019s. They got them, their problem", "NTA. 3 days a month is way too much.", "Agree. I was left widowed with three dogs and a cat. I'm trying to get out and visit famiky/friends more for my well-being. If I travel, I don't burden those who know my status and offer for free. I pay for boarding the dogs.", "Tell them to look on Rover for someone to stop by during the day or to pet sit. But they really are asking too much. I have a dog and a cat and I know that I am more limited in my travels and that adventures require more planning and financial considerations that come with hiring someone from Rover to stop by.", "Yah really I was floored to read that part!\n\nIt's ridiculous how many dog owners love them so much they wanna share the responsibility!!!!\n\nOP is so clearly NTA that ....just wow...just wow...", "Yupp! Either that or start planning trips that are doggo friendly! My husband and I are going camping for our anniversary so that we can bring our 3 doggies \ud83e\udd70", "I frequently \u201chave plans\u201d that just are not doing something someone else (often work) wants me to do.", "Agreed. Also your cats need attention too and it\u2019s not healthy to leave them. Prioritize your animals first above someone else\u2019s", "Exactly! OP is paying to dog-sit.", "This is definitely possible, and I agree OP is NTA, but I have known a couple people/families over the years whose dogs have passed away while under the care of kennels/boarding services. It's possible the boyfriend has experienced the same.", "That is the REAL reason why they don\u2019t board them.", "Yes, agreed. If and only if she's interested in pet sitting occasionally, she needs to set the fee at a price she'd feel good about. It should cover her gas, travel time, plus, enough to make the weekend away from her cats worth it. Once/month is just too much to ask from someone essentially doing you a favor.", "Possibly. I won't dispute that there are risks to boarding one's pets. \n\nHowever, I still think it's more likely a money thing. It's cheaper to give OP a little gas money than to board 3 dogs over the weekend. Especially if it's once a month. Also, the partner refuses to share their reasoning.", "My sister used to try guilting me into looking after her 5 demon-spawn. I'd look after my two eldest nephews but I stopped after number 3 cause it was just too much. I find the best thing is to tell them some variation of \"fuck off\". Tends to end the \"we're family\" conversation pretty swiftly.", "Eww!!", "Our pet sitter comes to our house 3 times a day. The pets get to stay at home where they\u2019re comfortable and they get lots of love when she comes by. They\u2019re buds now. You don\u2019t have to kennel them to not beg family members to watch them. NTA and stop that immediately. Let them figure it out.", "Use the Rover app you can just drop them off at someones house or have an in-home sitter", "I use kennels that have a dog door that leads to a large run so they can come and go as they please.", "I managed a boarding and daycare facility for ten years. All our boarding was done in the daycare setting, so all dogs had to be socialized, and would spend their entire day playing with their buddies and being loved on by staff. They'd be exhausted by bedtime and would happily trot to their large (25sqft) kennel for dinner and sleep. Definitely not cruel for the right dogs! Some dogs did very poorly in that environment, were not socialized, etc. We referred them to in home pet sitters and wouldn't accept them, for boarding or daily daycare.", "Mine have come back full of ticks - from two different high-end boarders.  And, once with kennel cough even though she was vaccinated.  Maybe your sister can find another pet owner that lives nearby to trade pet care with.", "OP said they pay enough to\u2026not even cover the gas from driving round trip. Which kinda works out to them not paying her at all, actually.", "While I also agree with this, it's possible the bf just doesn't want to talk about it. It could have been something traumatic, who knows. But overall, I agree, OP is totally not the AH here!", "Being away from their human in an unknown environment, even with all the spiffy add-ons one can buy, can still be super stressful for many dogs. Kennelling isn\u2019t an option all the time.", "Same here, but I would still never put my dog in there for more than half a day. Dogs pick up good and bad habits. They're more socialized and are more comfortable playing with larger groups, but they also get more territorial and slightly more aggressive with dogs that overwhelm them. \n\nI guess i'm just a new type of dog owner, since everybody I know thinks similarly. If i'm going away for more than a day or two, I find a (professional) sitter that I trust and I know will train and handle him correctly, and that has at most 1-2 dogs of their own so he has stimulation during the day other than walks.", "Though sometimes it's not necessarily better, a family friend's dog lost an eye at a boarding facility because she got attacked by another dog :'(", "The one where we board our dogs is the same and it's air conditioned inside and they have a doggie door that they can go outside to a fenced in run.  They walk them and play with the dogs, too.", "Ah, I missed that. Yeah that sucks. It sounds like they are taking advantage of her kindness.", "[removed]", "They\u2019re 100% taking advantage of her. I used to be like OP where I\u2019d help out if I was available, then I decided I didn\u2019t want to be a door mat anymore and stopped being a yes man because it just wasn\u2019t good for my mental health.", "Yet right \"I planned on watching TV not surrounded by animals whose main selling point is 'eats its own feces'\n\nSounds a bit passive aggressive.", "yeah my golden had his first boarding experience this weekend and he was ZONKED all day yesterday. \n\nthe kennel posted videos of all the dogs running around the property a few times throughout the day. made us feel good that he has doggie friends.", "Yeah my pup goes to daycare several days a week so when I\u2019ve needed to board him he just goes there. It\u2019s close to his actual routine & he always has a great time.", "My cat just hates other cats, so definitely no boarding for her! I have a few trusted friends that will come once a day when we\u2019re away. She doesn\u2019t even appear to like/appreciate them lol.", "This sounds a lot like my daughter's daycare. Which we love", "I have a kennel that I love. They are trying to become a national chain. They have large indoor playrooms with lots of supervision. My dog has his own room but gets to play at least six hours a day. I really love this place but I don\u2019t want to name them here because I am afraid it will sound like advertising. Is it allowed? I\u2019ll reply to anyone who messages me.", "Yep - I pay for the extra walk/play time and a kong treat once a day.  100% worth it."]}
