I had actually had 'unofficially' spoken to every bridesmaid prior so they all knew that it was my intention to make them a bridesmaid, this was more of an official ask I guess where I could give them their gifts. When I spoke to 'MOH' before this lunch, she had agreed to be my MOH. I had at the time asked her if she would be fine with it and she said she would. The restaurant I chose was also semi private, we had a room to ourselves if that helps at all.\n\nSo I\u2019m worried that I might be a bridezilla so here for unbiased judgement.\n\nMe (28F) & my partner (30M) got engaged earlier this year. For the wedding we are keeping it low key - the only thing I want to be extra with is the experiences with my bridesmaids. Knowing that being a bridesmaid often comes with unwanted costs (dress, heels, hens party etc) I wanted to give them a \u2018will you be my bridesmaid?\u2019 box as a thank you.\n\nThese are hampers usually with a robe that says bridesmaid on them and a bottle of wine with other treats. It\u2019s cheesy I know but I wanted to do that for my friends. The ones I purchased cost $345 each and came with a bottle of champagne, heels and earrings for the wedding plus a $100 voucher to go towards the bridesmaid dress (enough to cover the planned dress).\n\nSome context here is that my MOH (30F) is an introvert and is struggling with a breakup from 4 years ago. They dated for almost 8 years, he dumped her and sent her into a depression. I supported her as best I can but she still struggles. She can\u2019t be around couples without going into a \u2018I\u2019m so alone\u2019 spiral.\n\nI was hoping for my wedding she would put these feelings aside to support me, especially given how much she has a good friendship with my fianc\u00e9 and how long it\u2019s been since the breakup but she has openly become cold and depressed whenever I mention my wedding, so I had tried to make sure I didn\u2019t bring it up around her too much, which brings us to the incident.\n\nI invited everyone to a restaurant for lunch and gave them the boxes asking each of them if they would be my bridesmaid. Everyone thought the boxes were amazing, but MOH went silent and didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nShe excused herself to the bathroom so I followed her and asked if she was okay. In the bathroom she accused me of being selfish, putting her on the spot despite me knowing about her mental health and that I was tacky for wasting money on a box especially given I know she doesn\u2019t drink a lot and that I was irresponsible because I had a wedding to pay for.\n\nI snapped and told her that I was trying to be nice and that she could at least pretend to be happy for me and accept the gift, I\u2019ve always been good with my money so don\u2019t pretend that\u2019s the issue. She stormed off leaving the box behind. My bridesmaids are on my side but suggested I shouldn\u2019t have put her on the spot in public. It\u2019s been 8 weeks and MOH hasn\u2019t returned my messages and I\u2019m honestly thinking that its time I let her go as a MOH.\n\nI honestly was hoping she could be happy for me and am hurt that she isn\u2019t \u2013 but I\u2019m also worried that I could just be a bridezilla that is expecting unrealistic things for a wedding, and that I am selfish for wanting her to support me despite her mental health.

Hope she gets some help because that is not normal behavior at all. To still be that hung up on a breakup after 4 years is sad enough, but to not be able to watch your friends get married because of it is just plain disgustingly selfish.", "NTA\n\nIf she still isn't over a break up that happened FOUR YEARS AGO to the point other people's weddings make her lose her shit, she needs to see a therapist. I understand having mental health issues, but it's her responsibility to treat them, not everyone else's to tiptoe around them. I say that as a medicated individual.\n\nYou didn't single her out. She wasn't thrust into the spotlight. You were there with all of your bridesmaids and they all got the same treatment. She made herself the star of the show by acting the way she did.", "NTA.  She wants you to curb your emotions about YOUR wedding FOUR YEARS after a break up because she is still hurting.  She needs therapy. I am sorry she made it all about her.", "NTA but reconsider the MOH. She's clearly not up for it, and her issues are causing her to come off as unsupportive and outright bitter. You are not the one who dumped her. People are not entitled to bleed on those who did not cut them.", "I have a hard time thinking you put her on the spot.  Since you had been through alot together, was this really a huge surprise that you wanted her to be a part of your wedding?  I think the bridesmaid box was a great idea especially with the voucher that would cover the cost of the dress. Plus heels and earrings!?  That was generous.  \n\nI understand that you thought she could put her feelings aside and be happy for you.  She just can\u2019t. With her MH and being introverted, you misjudged her ability to navigate this situation.  I don\u2019t think that makes you an AH or a bridezilla. \n\nThis brings us to her behavior:  It was rude of her to pass judgment on the cost of your gift, call it tacky, and tell you how to spend your money.  She apparently expects you to remember her MH at all times.  She could not share in your happiness.  She cannot handle being around other couples. She was mad about the champagne since she doesn\u2019t drink.  She sounds miserable. I also think she needs a new therapist because whatever she is doing now is not working.  \n\nNTA.", "I believe the words she was looking for were \"thank you.\"\n\nNTA", "Omfg the YTA ppl are insane.

Anyone with mental illness has to learn how to work through life.  If she couldn't handle being the MOH, she should have said something like a big thanks for asking and thinking of her, but it's not something she can do.", "I.N.F.O. edit: NTA based on additional info.\n\nWhy are you calling her your MOH when she hasn't accepted that role? You seem kinda intent on shoving her into the role you want, not listening to her answer.", "NTA; even if you didn't have a prior conversation,  it's been FOUR years since her breakup. She has to learn to put her feelings aside for people she cares about. I agree with being sensitive to people, but we also don't need to walk on eggshells. This is a totally normal tradition to ask bridesmaids in this fashion!", "NTA per your added info. If your friend is struggling this much, she needs to participate in therapy. She has no right to lash out at others just trying to live their lives and god forbid you experience some joy in front of her. \n\nI would definitely *not* have her in the wedding in any capacity. And I would rethink this friendship in general. I have mental health issues and have gone through trauma and other hard things. It does not give me license to take things out on my friends.", "NTA. To be honest she doesn\u2019t sound like a very good friend. Four years is a long time. This is about your wedding, not her. You sound like a thoughtful caring friend. I would replace MOH and stop reaching out. Not only did she lose a partner (FOUR years ago), she has now lost a great friend. This would be a deal breaker for me.", "Is she really still sad after 4 years, or does she just like the attention of everyone being so nice to her? To still be hungup over an ex 4 years later is ridiculous and to be so wrapped up in yourself as to refuse to allow others to be happy is selfish. I suspect she really is just doing it because she loves the attention and validation she gets from everyone with her 'woe is me'.\n\nEither way, NTA.", "NTA she should also work on herself for her own good.

I went through a horrendous breakup 6 years ago that sent me into a spiral for a year, but I\u2019m absolutely fine now, and I\u2019m about to be a MOH for my high school best friend. \n\nEveryone processes grief differently, but for your friend to still be in this state of pain and jealousy after all this time is really concerning and frankly not normal. She needs therapy, stat. \n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong and she is being immature at best. You don\u2019t need her attitude dragging everything down. You sound like a very kind and thoughtful friend, but she is not reciprocating.

The MOH role involves a lot of planning, organizing, socializing, and talking to strangers. It might be a nightmare job for her.", "NTA.  Text her and give her a deadline to get back to you if she's still interested in being MOH.  Expect her not to bother, so start deciding who you want in her place.  Her emotional issues are hers to deal with and when they start becoming a problem for others, that's not on you.  8 weeks is a long time for you to wait while wedding planning.  Move on.", "I know people married for decades, with grown kids, who either got dumped without warning or caught their spouse cheating and ended it, and they still didn't need 4+ years to \"struggle\"with it, let alone go into a spiral over anyone else's happiness.

It's been 4 years, she should be able to support you and be happy for you.", "NTA Honestly is sounds like it's time to let he go as a \"friend\" too. Ok she had a break FOUR FUCKING YEARS AGO. She needs to get over it or get some fucking therapy. it's ridiculous at this point. She wasnt married to the man, had no children. It's beating a dead horse; she's dragging it. Way to make the situation about her. She is selfish and needs help. This just annoyed tf outta me.\n\nETA Even without your edit, she showed her ass and you werent wrong. Dont listen to these ppl in these comments.", "NTA- i get a breakup after 8 years is hard but 4 years of mourning this relationship is not healthy. There is a saying something like \"resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die\". She's choosing to be miseable, i bet her ex isn't. She knew what you were going to ask and yet she behaved like a drama queen. I think it is time for some tough love. BTW those bridesmaid boxes sound so lovely!", "NTA ! How did you \"put her on the spot?\" You asked her previously and she said yes!!! What did you put her on the spot with... giving a gift??!!! Come, on. She's being absurd.\n\nHonestly with this reaction, if she doesn't apologize, you might want to consider a new MOH or at least ask her if she feels up to it. I didn't have an official MOH, but my sisters were, and both helped me SO SO much, especially one. She may have done more than me tbh. She made a spreadsheet, with the best wedding venues and prices, which found us the best most amazing but inexpensive venue you could even dream of. She arranged my wedding dress appointments at 2 places, including the one I got a dress. She went wedding dress, wedding shoe, wedding decoration shopping with me. My other sister definitely helped a lot too and found me a make-up artist even though I waited too long. Both took charge of important things at the wedding. I'm realizing now I didn't do anywhere NEAR enough for them appreciation wise, and I should give a big fat x-mas gift.\n\nBut you need a MOH that is at least excited for you. Preferably one that wants to help, although obviously I was beyond lucky and blessed with all my BMs, especially my sisters. You cannot be trying to do a wedding and dealing with a MOH that is having that hard a time with this. What kind of speech is she going to make? How is planning the shower going to be? Geez I was lucky, but you still need someone actually excited about the wedding.", "NTA!!! My MOH and \u201cbest friend\u201d had this EXACT same break up scenario and promised she would be okay with my wedding\u2026 and then made my whole wedding day about herself. Would run off crying every time I was happy (which was the whole damn day). Didn\u2019t help me with anything, completely self centered.

Most of the girls saw it for what it was, but they aren't the ones you've been supporting for 4 years (!) through depression and protracted inability to accept the end of a relationship. I would have probably asked people (or at least the MOH) privately and *then* surprised them with the boxes. On a practical note you also spent a lot of money on them, are they returnable/exchangeable if someone couldn't do it, or didn't want to, or you got the wrong shoe size?

It's clear that she can't bear your happiness and is incapable of celebrating with you.\n\nI very much hope that she's working through her pain of the breakup and jealousy of other's happiness with a professional who can help her.\n\nNTA", "NTA and you did not put her in a difficult position at all. It\u2019s been 4 years and the fact she can\u2019t put her feelings aside and just smile through a lunch already shows she should not be in your bridal party at all. If she\u2019s reacted this way over a box and in a restaurant imagine when asked to do anything else related to the wedding or how she will react on the wedding day? You will be setting yourself up for failure and making things difficult for yourself. \n\nCut her off as maid of honour which I highly doubt is a title she even wants so that works out well and get on with your wedding planning with support from others.", "NTA. You sound like a good friend. Too bad she can\u2019t return the favor.", "ESH\n\nSounds like she accepted the MOH role before her emotional state got shattered\n\nYou need to accept she is not able or willing to do that anymore", "NTA she\u2019s hung up on a relationship from 4 years ago? She\u2019s just making excuses to cause problems. That is ridiculous. She\u2019s an adult, if she can\u2019t act like one then she shouldn\u2019t be your MOH.", "I have begged her to see a therapist, she flat out refuses. I don't think it's okay that she's still this sad 4 years on and it breaks my heart.  I've tried to help her try journaling, anything that might help but for some reason she just wont. She's the smartest person I know but for some reason she refuses to believe in the validity of therapy.", "> You should have gently asked her about this in advance, imo.\n\nOP did, see the edit.", "I should have put this in the post but I honestly forgot, me and MOH had spoken about this unofficially before the lunch. I had actually had 'unofficially' spoken to every bridesmaid prior so they all knew that it was my intention to make them a bridesmaid, this was more of an official ask I guess where I could give them their gifts.  When I spoke to 'MOH' before this lunch, she had agreed to be my MOH. I had at the time asked her if she would be fine with it and she said she would, although maybe deep down I knew she was putting on a brave face.  The restaurant I chose was also semi private, we had a room to ourselves if that helps at all.", "This. Sounds like she's becoming a black hole of mememe.", "This right here.", "How sure is OP that her friend isn't in love with HER?", "She agreed to be MOH in advance of this dinner. It's in an edit and a reply to my comment.", "Thank you :) I think I am a little bit of a AH because I let the excitement take over. But all the gifts are returnable with receipts, I know how awkward giving clothes can be at the best of times!", "Just so I\u2019m reading this right\u2026 you think it\u2019s normal, because she\u2019s an introvert, to take **16 years** to get over a relationship she was in from 18-24? That\u2019s\u2026 not a product of being an introvert. That\u2019s an indication that she\u2019s having some serious mental health issues and could use some professional support. 4 years is absolutely beyond a normal amount of time to be at least heal in from this relationship.", "For some context, MOH agreed to the role prior to this lunch. She goes through waves of being happy and sad so it's difficult to tell. The empathy comment is unnecessary though, she is my best friend and have been her sole source of support for the last 4 years. She doesn't speak to her family and has never made any other friends which puts a lot of pressure on me. I have taken her to see therapists but she refuses to continue, I have been there for her when she's cried, I invite her to every Christmas, Easter and celebration to make sure she knows she has someone who thinks about her. After 4 years of me doing this for her, I was hoping she would turn around and support me. I know this is selfish in some ways, but its been a long 4 years. I'm not fighting the judgement, just pointing out that assumptions about a situation are often incorrect. I see a psychologist myself only to protect my mental health in helping her because it's hard but I do it because she is my friend.", "It\u2019s been 4 years! My god.", "She\u2019s been going through a rough patch for 4 years.", "I love the way that you just ignore that. She's sad about something that happened four years ago. At some point you are responsible for your own happiness and mental health. This girl just wants the attention. Even before the o p's added, she was not in the wrong. She made very specific accommodations and expected. Her friend to be happy for her as any friend should be.", "She did and she accepted the roll. This was the bride giving a huge gift. A friend would be happy for the bride", "NTA", "Abusive??? Man you throw that word around WAY to lightly. You\u2019re an idiot.", "You need to send her a note that says:\n\n\"I love you. You haven't returned my messages in 8 weeks so I must assume that you have gone No Contact with me.  To ensure there is no issue moving forward, I would love to have you back in my life but I will be asking someone else to take on the role of MOH. I do wish you the best and a happy future.\"\n\nThen drop the rope.\n\nFrankly, you should not have selected someone to be your maid of honor who could not even show basic happiness at your wedding announcement.\n\nTo be MOH, not only would she have to show happiness but she would have to be an active participant and should be ADDING to the joy.\n\nYou said that you have suggested therapy and journaling. You cannot make her mental health journey for her. \n\nChoose better when selecting your next MOH. Think of the ROLE THEY WILL HAVE TO PLAY and who could do it.", "I would gently start to establish some gentle boundaries, it sounds like you have been a very good friend to her but you can't be her sole source of support. That's too much for you, and not healthy for her.", "If so you have been a good friend to her OP, some people just don't want to change/ can't see that there's a problem. And there's nothing any outsider can do about that. It's not your fault and you may have to accept that you guys are on different life paths for now.\n\nCongrats on your wedding!", "4 years is a long time. You should not be walking on egg shells at this point. Honestly, I think she needs some tough love at this time.", "Time to butt out. Leave it all alone.   \nIf she wanted to sort this, she\u2019s an intelligent woman and would. She doesn\u2019t need friends harping on at her about it.   \n\n\nAllow her to take a step back, who knows\u2026 without saying it to her face, maybe she will realise in this situation that she needs help and access it. (For heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t SAY THAT TO HER!)", "But you were hoping she'd \"put her feelings aside\" for your wedding? This goes beyond normal feelings, and it doesn't sound like she's capable of putting them aside or managing them in a healthy way at all.", "Some \"smart\" people think they're too smart to need therapy or too smart for it to work on them. Which shows they're not as smart as they think they are.  She has claimed this loss as her new identity and won't let it go until a new identity comes along. No one can help her with that.", "She was a terrible choice for bridesmaid let alone MOH. Remove her from the wedding party for her sake and yours", "Thanks! Just edited my comment. Glad OP added that info", "You need to edit it into the post, because is completely changes the context that you talked with her in advance. I still think she was giving clear signs of being uncomfortable, but it makes a huge difference that she already agreed to be MOH. NTA", "This changes things because it sounds like you put her on the spot before the edit.\n\nHowever, she is in her feelings so respect that and don't badger her about it.", "No OP! Don\u2019t say you\u2019re an asshole, you\u2019re definitely NTA here.\n\nYou did a nice thing for your friends, and no one should harp you on that. Your friend needs some serious help, and I\u2019m sorry but if she doesn\u2019t get it I don\u2019t see how you can expect her to stand up next to you when you get married.\n\nI know that\u2019s not fair to you, but have you thought about if this continues and she ends up ruining your wedding somehow? Unintentionally even. Idk man, it\u2019s a hard situation.", "Just tell her you didn't realize how upset the gifts would make her and you don't want to upset her more with all the bridesmaid stuff but you would love to have her relax and be a guest at the wedding if she is comfortable with that. Honestly, she would ruin all the bridesmaid get togethers and/or showers by making them about her, anyway. You need to ditch her as MOH while making it look like it was her idea.", "How long she takes is no one else's business.", "But did she warned of how she gonna publicly give her the gift?", "This is a great script and I hope OP sees it.", "This is the appropriate & kind response OP needs to send to friend!!!", "This 100%. How does this comment not have 100 more likes? \nOp do this right here!", "Also noting that you can't control her mental health journey, or speed it up, no matter how much you want to help. You have to let go of this a little bit", "My Grandfather passing away sent me into a depressive spiral 3 years ago, and while it still hurts, I was pretty okay after a year. 4 years over just a breakup is excessive.", "Done! Sorry new to this!", "Omg it was a group of them, all the bridesmaids in a private room. The bride in no way did anything wrong here. \nThe friend is milking to break up from four years ago for attention and the poor me syndrome. \nIf she can't be happy for her friend because she broke up with somebody 4 years ago. She has some serious mental health issues at best. But since she refuses to go to any kind of therapy, she kind owns that it's like she wants to wallow and self pity and bring everybody down with her.\n\nIt would be so exhausting, trying to be friends with somebody who got mad at being given a gift and having to check every single thing by her before you did anything in your own life just because they might get up set,  who wants that in their life? Who needs that kind of drama all the time."]}
