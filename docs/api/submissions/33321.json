I had actually had 'unofficially' spoken to every bridesmaid prior so they all knew that it was my intention to make them a bridesmaid, this was more of an official ask I guess where I could give them their gifts. When I spoke to 'MOH' before this lunch, she had agreed to be my MOH. I had at the time asked her if she would be fine with it and she said she would. The restaurant I chose was also semi private, we had a room to ourselves if that helps at all.\n\nSo I\u2019m worried that I might be a bridezilla so here for unbiased judgement.\n\nMe (28F) & my partner (30M) got engaged earlier this year. For the wedding we are keeping it low key - the only thing I want to be extra with is the experiences with my bridesmaids. Knowing that being a bridesmaid often comes with unwanted costs (dress, heels, hens party etc) I wanted to give them a \u2018will you be my bridesmaid?\u2019 box as a thank you.\n\nThese are hampers usually with a robe that says bridesmaid on them and a bottle of wine with other treats. It\u2019s cheesy I know but I wanted to do that for my friends. The ones I purchased cost $345 each and came with a bottle of champagne, heels and earrings for the wedding plus a $100 voucher to go towards the bridesmaid dress (enough to cover the planned dress).\n\nSome context here is that my MOH (30F) is an introvert and is struggling with a breakup from 4 years ago. They dated for almost 8 years, he dumped her and sent her into a depression. I supported her as best I can but she still struggles. She can\u2019t be around couples without going into a \u2018I\u2019m so alone\u2019 spiral.\n\nI was hoping for my wedding she would put these feelings aside to support me, especially given how much she has a good friendship with my fianc\u00e9 and how long it\u2019s been since the breakup but she has openly become cold and depressed whenever I mention my wedding, so I had tried to make sure I didn\u2019t bring it up around her too much, which brings us to the incident.\n\nI invited everyone to a restaurant for lunch and gave them the boxes asking each of them if they would be my bridesmaid. Everyone thought the boxes were amazing, but MOH went silent and didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nShe excused herself to the bathroom so I followed her and asked if she was okay. In the bathroom she accused me of being selfish, putting her on the spot despite me knowing about her mental health and that I was tacky for wasting money on a box especially given I know she doesn\u2019t drink a lot and that I was irresponsible because I had a wedding to pay for.\n\nI snapped and told her that I was trying to be nice and that she could at least pretend to be happy for me and accept the gift, I\u2019ve always been good with my money so don\u2019t pretend that\u2019s the issue. She stormed off leaving the box behind. My bridesmaids are on my side but suggested I shouldn\u2019t have put her on the spot in public. It\u2019s been 8 weeks and MOH hasn\u2019t returned my messages and I\u2019m honestly thinking that its time I let her go as a MOH.\n\nI honestly was hoping she could be happy for me and am hurt that she isn\u2019t \u2013 but I\u2019m also worried that I could just be a bridezilla that is expecting unrealistic things for a wedding, and that I am selfish for wanting her to support me despite her mental health.

Hope she gets some help because that is not normal behavior at all. To still be that hung up on a breakup after 4 years is sad enough, but to not be able to watch your friends get married because of it is just plain disgustingly selfish.", "NTA\n\nIf she still isn't over a break up that happened FOUR YEARS AGO to the point other people's weddings make her lose her shit, she needs to see a therapist. I understand having mental health issues, but it's her responsibility to treat them, not everyone else's to tiptoe around them. I say that as a medicated individual.\n\nYou didn't single her out. She wasn't thrust into the spotlight. You were there with all of your bridesmaids and they all got the same treatment. She made herself the star of the show by acting the way she did.", "NTA.  She wants you to curb your emotions about YOUR wedding FOUR YEARS after a break up because she is still hurting.  She needs therapy. I am sorry she made it all about her.", "NTA but reconsider the MOH. She's clearly not up for it, and her issues are causing her to come off as unsupportive and outright bitter. You are not the one who dumped her. People are not entitled to bleed on those who did not cut them.", "I have a hard time thinking you put her on the spot.  Since you had been through alot together, was this really a huge surprise that you wanted her to be a part of your wedding?  I think the bridesmaid box was a great idea especially with the voucher that would cover the cost of the dress. Plus heels and earrings!?  That was generous.  \n\nI understand that you thought she could put her feelings aside and be happy for you.  She just can\u2019t. With her MH and being introverted, you misjudged her ability to navigate this situation.  I don\u2019t think that makes you an AH or a bridezilla. \n\nThis brings us to her behavior:  It was rude of her to pass judgment on the cost of your gift, call it tacky, and tell you how to spend your money.  She apparently expects you to remember her MH at all times.  She could not share in your happiness.  She cannot handle being around other couples. She was mad about the champagne since she doesn\u2019t drink.  She sounds miserable. I also think she needs a new therapist because whatever she is doing now is not working.  \n\nNTA.", "I believe the words she was looking for were \"thank you.\"\n\nNTA", "Omfg the YTA ppl are insane.

Anyone with mental illness has to learn how to work through life.  If she couldn't handle being the MOH, she should have said something like a big thanks for asking and thinking of her, but it's not something she can do.", "I.N.F.O. edit: NTA based on additional info.\n\nWhy are you calling her your MOH when she hasn't accepted that role? You seem kinda intent on shoving her into the role you want, not listening to her answer.", "NTA; even if you didn't have a prior conversation,  it's been FOUR years since her breakup. She has to learn to put her feelings aside for people she cares about. I agree with being sensitive to people, but we also don't need to walk on eggshells. This is a totally normal tradition to ask bridesmaids in this fashion!", "NTA per your added info. If your friend is struggling this much, she needs to participate in therapy. She has no right to lash out at others just trying to live their lives and god forbid you experience some joy in front of her. \n\nI would definitely *not* have her in the wedding in any capacity. And I would rethink this friendship in general. I have mental health issues and have gone through trauma and other hard things. It does not give me license to take things out on my friends.", "NTA. To be honest she doesn\u2019t sound like a very good friend. Four years is a long time. This is about your wedding, not her. You sound like a thoughtful caring friend. I would replace MOH and stop reaching out. Not only did she lose a partner (FOUR years ago), she has now lost a great friend. This would be a deal breaker for me.", "Is she really still sad after 4 years, or does she just like the attention of everyone being so nice to her? To still be hungup over an ex 4 years later is ridiculous and to be so wrapped up in yourself as to refuse to allow others to be happy is selfish. I suspect she really is just doing it because she loves the attention and validation she gets from everyone with her 'woe is me'.\n\nEither way, NTA.", "NTA she should also work on herself for her own good.

I went through a horrendous breakup 6 years ago that sent me into a spiral for a year, but I\u2019m absolutely fine now, and I\u2019m about to be a MOH for my high school best friend. \n\nEveryone processes grief differently, but for your friend to still be in this state of pain and jealousy after all this time is really concerning and frankly not normal. She needs therapy, stat. \n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong and she is being immature at best. You don\u2019t need her attitude dragging everything down. You sound like a very kind and thoughtful friend, but she is not reciprocating.

The MOH role involves a lot of planning, organizing, socializing, and talking to strangers. It might be a nightmare job for her.", "NTA.  Text her and give her a deadline to get back to you if she's still interested in being MOH.  Expect her not to bother, so start deciding who you want in her place.  Her emotional issues are hers to deal with and when they start becoming a problem for others, that's not on you.  8 weeks is a long time for you to wait while wedding planning.  Move on.", "I know people married for decades, with grown kids, who either got dumped without warning or caught their spouse cheating and ended it, and they still didn't need 4+ years to \"struggle\"with it, let alone go into a spiral over anyone else's happiness.

It's been 4 years, she should be able to support you and be happy for you.", "NTA Honestly is sounds like it's time to let he go as a \"friend\" too. Ok she had a break FOUR FUCKING YEARS AGO. She needs to get over it or get some fucking therapy. it's ridiculous at this point. She wasnt married to the man, had no children. It's beating a dead horse; she's dragging it. Way to make the situation about her. She is selfish and needs help. This just annoyed tf outta me.\n\nETA Even without your edit, she showed her ass and you werent wrong. Dont listen to these ppl in these comments.", "NTA- i get a breakup after 8 years is hard but 4 years of mourning this relationship is not healthy. There is a saying something like \"resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die\". She's choosing to be miseable, i bet her ex isn't. She knew what you were going to ask and yet she behaved like a drama queen. I think it is time for some tough love. BTW those bridesmaid boxes sound so lovely!", "NTA ! How did you \"put her on the spot?\" You asked her previously and she said yes!!! What did you put her on the spot with... giving a gift??!!! Come, on. She's being absurd.\n\nHonestly with this reaction, if she doesn't apologize, you might want to consider a new MOH or at least ask her if she feels up to it. I didn't have an official MOH, but my sisters were, and both helped me SO SO much, especially one. She may have done more than me tbh. She made a spreadsheet, with the best wedding venues and prices, which found us the best most amazing but inexpensive venue you could even dream of. She arranged my wedding dress appointments at 2 places, including the one I got a dress. She went wedding dress, wedding shoe, wedding decoration shopping with me. My other sister definitely helped a lot too and found me a make-up artist even though I waited too long. Both took charge of important things at the wedding. I'm realizing now I didn't do anywhere NEAR enough for them appreciation wise, and I should give a big fat x-mas gift.\n\nBut you need a MOH that is at least excited for you. Preferably one that wants to help, although obviously I was beyond lucky and blessed with all my BMs, especially my sisters. You cannot be trying to do a wedding and dealing with a MOH that is having that hard a time with this. What kind of speech is she going to make? How is planning the shower going to be? Geez I was lucky, but you still need someone actually excited about the wedding.", "NTA!!! My MOH and \u201cbest friend\u201d had this EXACT same break up scenario and promised she would be okay with my wedding\u2026 and then made my whole wedding day about herself. Would run off crying every time I was happy (which was the whole damn day). Didn\u2019t help me with anything, completely self centered.

Most of the girls saw it for what it was, but they aren't the ones you've been supporting for 4 years (!) through depression and protracted inability to accept the end of a relationship. I would have probably asked people (or at least the MOH) privately and *then* surprised them with the boxes. On a practical note you also spent a lot of money on them, are they returnable/exchangeable if someone couldn't do it, or didn't want to, or you got the wrong shoe size?

Depression is not something that can be turned on or off, as much as I'm sure she would love to be able to be happy for you, the whole event is triggering feelings that from the sounds of it she has not been able to process and move on from. It's good that you've recommended therapy, it sounds like she would benefit from it a lot. However depression is a difficult and complex issue, it can't be fixed over night and can take months or years to completely process the emotions associated with a break up, depending on whether it's just the break up that is the cause of the issue or whether the issue lies much deeper; break ups can trigger feelings of unworthiness or failure which stem from previous life events, although it's usually not clear for the person that this is the case. I would suggest that you manage your expectation of her ability to be happy for her, because it's something that she doesn't necessarily have the ability to do right now, until she has the tools to deal with the unprocessed emotions left over from the breakup, which could be gained from therapy for example.\n\nIt's also good that you've tried not to bring up the wedding too much because you recognise that she is struggling with it. Clearly you care a lot about her and are trying to protect her feelings.\n\nGiving your friends the hamper as an official thank you present over lunch was a very sweet gesture, it was very thoughtful of you to do this given the expense of being a bridesmade. I think unfortunately your MOH wasn't able to see this because of her current struggles, but also it sounds like a little bit of a lack of emotional intelligence. As an introvert yes, it could have been hard for her to receive such a gift in a public setting, the lunch may well have been overwheliming for her as an extroverted setting, not to mention the obvious difficulties for her around the wedding stuff. It sounds like she wasn't able to manage that so she walked off to calm down, which is a prefectly valid response from her. Now normally someone with high emotional intelligence would be able to use this space to understand why they've become overwhelmed, then come back to you OP and explain why they walked off, and then express gratitude for the gift etc. It's good of you to check on your friend to see if she's okay, a normal response in this case I think.", "If you actually read the post the $100 voucher was for their dress and the bride covered the shoes and jewelry.

I'm sure she wants to be able to happily participate and celebrate as your MOH. Otherwise I don't know why she would have said yes to any of it in the first place.\n\nI had a really hard time with a breakup a few years back. I was similarly devastated and my ex hurt me deeply to ensure the breakup was final. I was already struggling with mental health and it made things a lot worse for a long while. It took years.\n\nDuring that time a close friend and coworker asked me to be a bridesmaid. It was so, so, soooo hard to not just cry the whole way through the wedding. It wasn't even just because I was single or felt loss at my past relationship not working out. It was like rubbing s deep, open wound. Just pain from all kinds of hurt and related associations.\n\nI kind of wish I'd said I couldn't. I can't imagine if I'd been asked to be MOH. But I didn't WANT any of that pain to hold me back. I was sick of it getting in the way or sneaking up on me when I knew I was supposed to be happy or celebrating other people. So of course I said yes.\n\nTo be honest, everyone always screams \"THERAPY\" but it's not really that simple. A good therapist is hard to find. Sometimes medication is needed to help break through and engage. And sometimes it's just really hard to engage in a way that makes genuine progress. I did therapy and medication, but all the progress I ever made was just from the work I put in myself, slowly over time and because I'd hit a point where I was ready for another small step forward and was aware of what I needed to work on.\n\nI'm sorry your friend blew up on you. I'm sorry she ran out and hasn't been returning your calls. I'm sorry she's not getting herself the help she needs or isn't improving in ways that can be seen yet.\n\nI know you want to be celebrating and want her celebrating with you. But I think the best thing to do here would be to show her some compassion and grace.\n\nTell her you love her and tell her it's okay, that you are glad she wanted to be able to join your wedding party but that she doesn't have to force herself. You love her and value her friendship and mental health. It's just one day, you both will still be there for each other. And if she thinks she'd be up for joining the wedding party as a bridesmaid, just leave room for her to grieve. Emotions are complicated. She can be happy for you, happy to be there, and still hurt.", "How doew covid have anything to do with this? Lmao thanks for the reminder though we", "Kinda sounds like the OP covered the worst of it with the box and if it\u2019s going to be a local bachelorette and wedding, the costs should be pretty low.", "It doesn't, only the judgement of the most upvoted response counts", "Well yeah it's not outrageous for friends to be excited for each other when they have something positive happening in their lives. Friends should be special to one another, it's not entitled for OP to hope for positive support from her friend.", "that as well, yes.", "In this case it sounds like she's walked off to calm down, but perhaps in you following her she felt like she was being attacked or felt like she had to defend her actions (again, an emotionally intelligent person would be able to say clearly \"I'm overwhelmed by the situation, I need space to calm down\", however she's lashed out at you). Perhaps she's still quite highly overwhelmed at the point you walked in, so she's lashed out with the full force of all of the things that she was struggling with - not a valid response, it sounds like it was a combination of unlucky timing on your part and also lack of emotional intelligence on her part and she's lashed out. Now admittedly you \"snapping\" at her and saying \"she could at least pretend to be happy for me and accept the gift\" would not have helped the situation here. As mentioned depression is very complex, and often comes with guilt and shame for not being able to deal with the emotions or \"just get over it\". The person can feel very helpless and frustrated at being unable to move past it, so snapping at someone and expecting them to be able to put their complex feelings aside is going to trigger those feelings of shame and guilt in the person and possibly make them lash out, but the expectation is also unrealistic on your part. I can see why she's lashed out here, but also remember that it's because she is struggling emotionally here and in a way her lashing out is a way of indirectly/subconsciously communicating that. She needs help and support, but is unable to see that at the moment.\n\nIn short, neither of you are the A hole here. You've already taken steps to make her feel supported and to try to understand her feelings, which shows you are caring and empathetic. You also want her to be a MOH, which shows you care about her A LOT. She also is struggling with something that she doesn't understand, is unable to find the words to communicate her feelings, and probably feels alone and unsupported. Because she is unable to communicate her feelings, she is unable to tell you how best to support her, and thus feels unsupported and alone. Depression is a viscious cycle and needs to be broken somewhere.", "Hard as it is at this happy time in your life, it may be a blessing in disguise to have this distance.  It will be hard not to get sucked back into the sole support role but it doesn't sound healthy for either of you.  And not fair to you to be someone's sole support.  Good luck and have a wonderful wedding surrounded by bridesmaids who are happy to let your day be about you.", "I didn\u2019t ignore that at all - people can have depression for many years, for their whole life. The edit that OP added certainly changes my perspective on it, but not this part. You\u2019re welcome to go upto someone who is sad and tell them they should decide not to have depression, but that\u2019s not going to change anything for them, because that\u2019s not how it works.\n\nIt\u2019s wild that you think she has depression for attention. An introvert wanting attention via depression is unlikely. And if she wanted attention, she\u2019d be responding to OP. She would have made a huge scene at the lunch. She would be picketing the wedding.", "In did read it and the only thing bridesmaids should have to pay for, for their 'uniform' on the day is alterations.", "This is a great script thank you :) I'm going to sit on it for the night while I process the judgement / comments. A lot of comments have made me reflect and realise that it was wishful thinking to expect her to be my MOH. In my mind I figured because she's my closest friend it would naturally mean she's my MOH. But she hasn't been a supportive friend for a really long time. I have 3 other friends who are actually genuinely positive and supportive. I might just get rid of the MOH role, and just have bridesmaids instead.", "This is great advice, and a kind but firm, approach.\n\nIf she's reacting like this after having already agreed to be MoH, there's no way she'll be able to do what needs to be done throughout the process.", "I hope OP doesn\u2019t have to choose another MOH ever, on a lighter note", "I had my brothers wedding approx 1 year after I\u2019d broken up with my fianc\u00e9e. I\u2019d also suffered two miscarriages in the 9 months prior to the break up. \n\nI sobbed at the hairdressers. \n\nAt the wedding itself? Had a blast and only cried tears of joy.", "I would suggest therapy is the right idea for her here. Although therapy can be a TERRIFYING concept for many people, and often people are in denial that they need help or support. Often people assume that enough time passes, they'll just get over it, therefore they can't accept that therapy is necessary to move on. So she probably is unable to accept that she needs therapy at this moment. Therapy is also a journey, and can involve many ups and downs. It's not a simple case of just going a few times and getting \"fixed\". It's an iterative and cumulative process, that requires consistency over many weeks / months / years depending on the complexity of the issues.\n\nNow it depends on how much you want to / can support her on this journey at this current moment in time. I will assume that in an ideal world, because you've asked her to be MOH and clearly care a lot about her, you would have the emotional capacity to support her fully through this. However, an upcoming wedding adds extra complexity to the issue. You probably have A LOT going on right now with stress and planning and understandably probably want to be able to enjoy such a significant event. Therefore you might not have a lot of emotional capacity RIGHT NOW to fully support her, which is valid. You may wish to wait until after your wedding to fully support her, which is valid. \n\nThe decision around how you want her in the wedding is a BIG one. You may wish to delegate her to bridesmade. You may wish to remove her from from bridesmade, or you may wish to uninvite her conpletely. If you really feel like you need to take that decision because you need someone who is emotionally well at the moment and can fully support you through your big day, that is valid. However, if you're making the decision based on you perceiving her not wanting to be MOH or involved in the wedding at all, I would just ask her what she wants rather than assuming. Either way, it's also worth you managing your expectations around how she will be able to support you through the day.", "The dresses are paid for it\u2019s the $100 voucher which covers the planned dresses. chances are Op hasn\u2019t been able to take them to try on the dress to get their sizes! You read but couldn\u2019t comprehend.", "I just had bridesmaids and it was perfect.", "> In my mind I figured because she's my closest friend it would naturally mean she's my MOH\n\nand if you hadnt chosen her you probably would have gotten the same response. Her throwing a tantrum because she wasnt chosen. You were in a no win situation here, at least thats the way i see it.  Yea you made a bad decision of requesting her to be MOH. Because you knew her mental state. But i get it, you were hoping as a close friend who you have supported, you expected the same in return. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming nuptials. The gift box sounds like a neat idea too. I hope that if you do decide to chose one of the other girls that none will be like \"oh i guess we are just second best here\". So maybe a good idea to remove the MOH title and have them as bridesmaids instead\n\nStill NTA though", "Well I do wonder what her reaction would have been if you had not have made her MOH? Not even made her a bridesmaids.. makes me wonder.. This feels like a lose/lose situation OP. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding, sounds really lovely!", "Good plan.", "Your closest friend who hasn't talked to you for over eight weeks?", "I cried both times, my 1st love and only husband wed 2 more times \ud83d\ude06, I cried harder when he died \ud83d\ude14 Love is strange.", "I would suggest a letter or message here is a good idea. Look into the the positive sandwich technique for how to structure the letter. She needs to feel loved and supported but also probably needs a bit of tough love here.\n\nI would explain clearly how much you care for her and how you want to support her. Try to see it from her side as much as possible, it might be worth researching into breakups a bit and understanding what emotions can be brought up, people often feel alone through such experiences so feeling like someone understands or can relate is HUGE, it also allows the person to start talking about it and putting it into words. Also explain how much support you can give her NOW, but also LATER (i.e. after the wedding) so that she can manage her expectations. However, also explain WHY you can give her X amount of support, so that she doesn't overthink why you might not be able to support her. People with depression often feel like a burden or like people don't want to help them, this ties in with feelings of unworthiness. Then try the bit of tough love. Explain to her how you can see she is struggling with this (and that struggling is okay and nothing to be ashamed of, HUGE point to include!) but that you think she needs to get support for it through therapy etc. If you need to remove her from the MOH position, I would put it here, but again explain clearly why you're doing it, don't leave it for misinterpretation and word it very carefully so she doesn't feel unworthy or ashamed. Finally end on a positive note of how you are willing to support her, such as helping her to look for therapists, maybe taking her to / picking her up from appointments if she needs it, being open to supporting her emotionally though it, etc. Finally, if you want her in the wedding in whatever capacity, I would reiterate that here. Explain that you would love for her to be there in whatever capacity she is able to be - she can still be MOH if she wants (if you still want), or bridesmade with no MOH, or not bridesmade, or don't come at all. Also give her the option of just coming for a bit - maybe coming for the whole thing would be too much, so maybe just coming for a little bit, skipping the ceremony/reception, or however she wants to, and also the option to leave early, would be good for her. Give her the freedom to attend how she feels she is able to without judgement. Finally, I'd finish by saying you understand if she needs to step away for the time being. It's possible that the wedding is just too much for her at the moment, and if she needs time away until after the wedding that is okay. You can reconvene afterwards and take it from there. Just finish on asking her to get in touch to let you know what she wants to do.\n\nAdditionally, I would give the following tips for when writing the letter:\n1) Her lashing out at you is not personal. She is struggling to deal with very complex emotions and needs a friend to show her they care, try not to take it personally and instead ask her probing questions to get her to explain how she feels (this will help her to begin to process her emotions)\n2) Expecting her to be able to \"pretend\" she's okay or \"just be happy\" for you is unrealistic, it's worth managing your own expectations of her here and understand that at the current moment in time she's unable to do certain things (note the term unable, it's not that she doesn't want to)\n3) When talking to her, avoid language that is accusatory or places expectations on her. Language such as \"you should be able\" or \"why can't you just\" can be very triggering for someone who is struggling with feelings of shame or guilt. Try to explicitly show her compassion and support with words, she may not be able to pick up on the subtleties of compassion or support through gestures etc.\n4) Try not to add fuel to the fire by calling her out on behavious that are too much of a tangent away from the main focus point, i.e. her snapping at you or not showing happiness for things. Again she probably feels guilt or shame so adding to it doesn't help. If you need to talk to someone because it's frustrated or upset you, I would suggest other friends or family would be the best course of action.\n5) Try to ask her what she wants rather than tell her what you want. \n6) Explain clearly why you are taking decisions, and try to not leave any ambiguity that she might be able to misinterpret as you not caring about her.\n7) Be patient. Give her space if she needs it and don't expect her to respond immediately. Generally it's also a good idea to ask someone if they need space or if they want to talk about it whenever they're upset, that way the ball is in their court and they don't feel too attacked or cornered.\n\nFinally, remember to genuinely thank her for it if she does come to the wedding, and try not to be too frustrated with her if she doesn't or can only come for a bit. I know you probably really want her to be present for the whole thing which is fair, but I'm sure she has A LOT going on right now, so her putting as much of it to the side in whatever capacity she is able to is HUGE and speaks volumes about how much she loves you.\n\nAnyway in short, neither of you are the A hole. Its just a bad situation with even worse timing. I hope you get to enjoy your big day and that she is able to move past this.
