I disagree. I really like that desk, and I want to keep it. \n\nWe had a few disagreements over what to do with it. I ended up sending it back to my parents house.

Not. His. \n\nYou're not even married or engaged. \n\nHe doesn't even live there yet. \n\nThat is a huge red flag that he is getting angry about at you for being in control of your own things. \n\nReally big red flag that he has some control/anger issues. \n\nWhy the reference to fixing up your car?

You're NTA and this is a red flag regarding your boyfriend. Assuming that he co-owns anything you have because you'll be living together is entitled and ridiculous. Acting as if he co-owned your property before even moving in, is even more ridiculous.

Well now you know he was going to. Huge red flag, like maybe slowdown your moving in together timeline if you can red flag", "uhm NTA. It's not his. Doesn't belong to him.

The only reason he's pissed you sent it back to your parents is because he can no longer sell it behind your back and benefit from the cost.\n\nIf you marry, you will never be able to enjoy the desk in your own home. If you stay together, he will lay claim to any of your stuff and money - he's just proven this to you.\n\nDo with that what you will but this is a big red flag, OP. It is worth a very firm conversation and boundries to be placed.", "It's your desk, you can do what you want with it.
