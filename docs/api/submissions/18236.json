Honestly may really need to reconsider this relationship because I don't see his views on your items to change.", "Yea honey he\u2019s manipulating the Heck out of you! \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 shut that sh*t down or tell him to respect your stuff and your family history!! (A good man would) He\u2019s absolutely in the wrong. An honestly it\u2019s probably safer at your family\u2019s house so he dont sell it without your permission, if he\u2019d take it that far? since he thinks it\u2019s all the sudden both of yours once he found out the value of it. Maybe watch your self with this guy! Don\u2019t let him manipulate you in the future, make sure he\u2019s who u want to keep around with you long term!", "Independence was 1776 (18th C.), so this story doesn't really hold up.", "NTA. Run don\u2019t walk.", "NTA, but beware of major Red flags. He was tottally going to sell it behind your back and the moment he said you can't make make decisions without consulting him is the cue you need to make a great decision in your life and leave this relationship. Good thing he hadn't move in.", "This type of guy will drain your savings, sell your jewelry and make you feel less than for questioning any of it. NTA. Also, run.", "NTA. He wouldn't have argued had he not known the value. He just saw a quick cash grab.", "NYA. It\u2019s not a shared piece of furniture - it\u2019s your desk. Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t value the history - he just wants to make a quick buck. Good work sending the desk away for safe keeping. You can get it back after you guys break up.", "Sorry but this is huge red flags of controlling behaviour. He's wanting to put it in storage because\"he finds it ugly\" this isn't even his place yet and he's saying what's ugly, then finds out it's worth a few pound and dollar signs light up in his eyes and now he wants to sell the ugly desk so he can spend money on what he sees fit. \n\nAnd then you move the desk back to your parents to keep it safe and he gets angry cos u moved stating u don't trust him not to sell it behind Ur back. \n\nThis last part is the hugest red flag of all he had already planned to sell it behind your back and admitted it without admitting it if you get me.\n\nSo sorry OP  but this man needs kicking to the curb you can do so much better and find someone who actually respects you and your family heirlooms. He has no respect for you or your things and he will make sure everything is changed to exactly how he wants it to be no matter what u would like.", "NTA. Just reading this made me angry. I really hope for your benefit and your future you reevaluate the relationship with this person. Things become \u201cours\u201d when you both decide they become \u201cours\u201d just because he is moving in doesn\u2019t entitle him to decide what he can do with your property.", "You've disagreed multiple times about this? Meaning he's  decided to argue multiple times with your decision to keep this item that's a) a gift to you, b) sentimentally valuable to your family, c) worth a lot of money, and d) YOURS, not his? Sure makes him sound like a selfish jerk who can't take no for an answer and doesn't respect you that much.", "Yes! DTMFA\n\nNTA", "I just hope that she doesn't let this guy move in. If he's trying to rob her blind, I wouldn't let this guy anywhere near me.", "Exactly. \"What's yours is mine, and what's mine's me own.\"", "Even if they were married... It is her table. You can have your own stuff evwn if you are married. Your own stuff that you can do with as you please, without asking permiaaion. Doubly so if you had it before then or if it is something given by family.\n\nIf you don't have this freedom, your relationship is probably abusive.", "Nah, just converted it into pounds because no one here would recognise my currency and would have to convert it into something you know anyways. Thought I\u2019d save everyone some work \ud83d\ude02", "I just thought he had a point about making room for his stuff if he\u2019s gonna live here too, and since we were having issues over the desk and it\u2019s mostly a decorative piece I thought sending it back to my parents would be for the best", "I\u2019d like to add that- I read no comments before I posted mine! Clearly the other commenter got the safe \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 as I did!", "Please run while you have time", "Now I need to know what country", "\ud83d\ude02 well, you made my head work anyways.
