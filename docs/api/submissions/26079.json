Due to the accident hurting her plus her being a preemie she is wheelchair bound. Well we knew my niece would be getting an electric wheelchair once she was 8 and we all knew she would have some questions about why her wheelchair now looked so different from her dolls. Last year her mom asked me if I could make her a doll with a wheelchair that looked similar to one of the expected models, little did my sister know I had actually been working on exactly that for a few years :)  \nWhen my niece was 5 I started making her a remote control electric wheelchair. It took me so long to find an RC car that was small enough and powerful enough to use for this, quick thanks to the cute guy running the RC shop who has spent years helping me with this. I made it super detailed with a working seatbelt and everything and over the last year I made her a custom doll that looks like her, AGD size if anyone is curious, to go with the wheelchair.  \nRecently she just got her electric wheelchair and we had a family celebration. She screamed when I rolled it out to her. The rest of the day was filled with many toys being strapped in and taken for a ride.  \nDuring the party my brother and nephew came up to me and asked me about him getting a custom RC car for his birthday in a few months. I let him know that I wouldn't be able to do anything like what he wanted that quickly (basically howl's moving castle on wheels with moving legs) but I could get him a cool car and paint it something special for him. This went over worse with my brother than with my nephew and since the party he's been saying I'm playing favorites.  \nMost of my family is on my side but some of my family says I play favorites with all the custom stuff I make for my niece (I make accessibility stuff sometimes) however I make custom toys for all of the kids in the family. Only one of my nieces or nephews has less than 20 things I've made and that's because she's 3 months old. Enough of my family are getting on my case that I'm starting to wonder if I did something wrong.  \nAITA for refusing to make my nephew the custom RC car we wanted even though I made my niece one?   \n", "created_utc": 1693665155, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168411z/aita_for_refusing_to_make_a_custom_rc_car_for_my/", "score": 973, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
