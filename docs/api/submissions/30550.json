Also, I don\u2019t know where you live but generally a speeding ticket affects only the driver the ticket was issued to. Not the car, or the cars owner. So you\u2019re in no trouble.\n\nI appreciate your opinion! In most cases, the driver who receives the ticket is indeed responsible for it. However, in certain situations, such as parking tickets or red-light camera citations, they might be directed to the car's owner. Nonetheless, thank you for confirming that the responsibility should lie with the individual who received the ticket.", "Certainly, I understand the perspective. While I might share some responsibility for lending the car, my concern is primarily regarding the accountability and responsibility my sister needs to shoulder for her actions. The ticket's financial impact and potential consequences could indeed affect me, which is why I am hesitant to foot the bill. I'm aware that enabling her behavior could have negative repercussions, but at the same time, I believe she needs to learn from her mistakes and take responsibility for her actions. The priority is holding her accountable rather than enabling a pattern of irresponsibility.", "The camera tickets I've seen had an option to declare you weren't the driver at the time. They all had pretty clear shots of the driver as well. I guess if that is the case, hopefully you two don't look too alike and you can take that option.", "You can usually redirect them to the driver if you can show it wasn\u2019t you.

I\u2019d bail her out this last time (realizing that you have some responsibility of blame here) and set that boundary that no more and you love her but you can\u2019t and won\u2019t keep saving her. \n\nMy mom told the last time after she bailed me out for a fight at a bar she wasn\u2019t going to bail me out ever again. My dumbass got arrested once more and she kept her word lol. Left my ass there.  Thankfully it wasn\u2019t anything serious but the courts were so backed up I winded up spending 47 days in jail for a crime that really only required 15 days lmao. \n\nI learned my lesson quickly \ud83d\ude1d\n\nMy brothers learned there\u2019s when I refused to take the blame or be his alibi for something he did."]}
