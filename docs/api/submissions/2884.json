Anytime this line of inquiry started up on me I was easily able to shut it down with, \u201chusband\u2019s had The Snip.\u201d People just have nothing further to say on the subject. Honestly, it was years of \u201cwhen will you have kids\u201d and then we had one and then years of \u201cwill you have a second???\u201d Ugh. I didn\u2019t mind engaging with it for awhile, especially among other new moms at that time but it did get really boring. It sounds like your crowd really went beyond the pale and you roasted them. Perhaps there was a more tactful way to shut it down. Like, you have my permission to lie and say you\u2019ve had your tubes tied. People seem to respect that. But sheesh. Who knows with your friends and family!?!? NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019ve made it clear to my family that I don\u2019t want kids and they\u2019re always trying to convince to have one. Why is it so important to other people whether someone has children or not?", "NTA, OP!\n\n\"I think that those comments are completely out of line and none of their business.\" You're absolutely right - that sums it up nicely!\n\nWhy on earth do people think it's acceptable to tell other people to have kids (that they don't even want)? Sometimes the motives are clumsily well-meant, but often they're anything but benign. Several decades ago, I told a college date that I didn't want to have children; he blurted out \"But if people like you don't have kids, then the poor people and the Blacks will take over!\" (Yes, that is a verbatim quote!) Need I add that that first date with him was our last?!", "NTA. Roast tf put them. They\u2019re assholes.", "They all used to tell me oh but you need to give them a sibling, think of how lonely they are without a brother or sister.  Bullshit I had a brother and I hated every minute of having a brother.  Not to mention I saw how insane the two of us bickering like it was our job in life made her insane.  I'm happy to have just one and he's happy to be an only.", "And I completely disagree with husband's comment that \"they weren't trying to be disrespectful\". Yes they were and have been for years. Only something drastic was going to get them to stop.", "It\u2019s gross and so weird", "\nThey have been horrible to you for years.", "My aunt had her tubes tied, but my cousin still happened. He\u2019s in his late 20s now. We tease him that he\u2019s an \u201caccident\u201d, but only because he cracks jokes about it all the time himself."]}
