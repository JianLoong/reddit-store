I, honestly, never wanted children. It was never a dream or goal of mine to be a mother. I got pregnant at 18 from my long term high school bf. I love my child to death, and I love being her mom. However, I don\u2019t want anymore children. Kids are a lot of work, and it\u2019s just not something I want to do all over again. I like the perks that come with just having one. I am able to afford more things for her, give her my undivided attention, and lead a relatively comfortable life. Her dad and I are no longer together, but I got remarried when she was 5. My husband has helped me raise her, and he\u2019s never asked me for a child of our own because he treats her as his own. She is now 14 and is learning how to be quite independent. It\u2019s required a lot of hard work, and I feel I can relax more often times than not as opposed to when she was younger and needed me more. Of course she still needs me, but not like she did when she was a toddler or a young child. The thought of starting all over with another one is overwhelming. My family and friends are constantly making comments about how I should just have another one because my biological clock is ticking and that my husband might want one in the future and will resent me for not giving him one. I think that those comments are completely out of line and none of their business. The other day, we had friends and family over for dinner. They were butting into my life again and making their rude remarks about my husband leaving me in the future and that I\u2019m getting old, so I snapped. I literally roasted everyone. I pulled a Michael Scott from The Office and told them that I don\u2019t want more kids because I see how much they struggle either financially, to get them in control, and how they\u2019re always so tired because of how much their kids drain them. When everyone left, my husband said I didn\u2019t need to go that far and that I acted like an asshole to everyone. He said my comments were rude and more out of line than their \u201csuggestions\u201d. He said that he didn\u2019t agree with them, but that they weren\u2019t trying to be disrespectful, and I was.
