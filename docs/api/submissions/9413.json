Hell, I'd give them something for the baby to eat (after asking, of course.)\n\nWhen you have controversial opinions like that, keep your mouth shut. I's not worth debating and disturbing the peace just to spread your two cents.", "So can I.", "They want it more if they think it is forbidden ;)", "NTA!", "How old is the gf?", "It sounds like baby was in parent\u2019s lap the entire time & never in it\u2019s own seat so I was wondering exactly how old he was.", "God I've had to have the \"please don't lick me\" conversation too many times.", "If you see a baby or small child doing something dangerous does it not make you anxious and demand your focus?", "Two simple truths: 1)!Seeing food inside other people's mouths is unappetizing, whatever age they are. Do you find it cute? 2) Your child is only adorable to you. So again: child's birthday? Go for it? Adult's birthday at dinnertime? Please respect others. The proof that it was upsetting is that someone got upset.", "They disrespected a family member, so apparently they don't care about that. Or about the child's bedtime. (I wouldn't have to get over it because I'd have been out of there with BF and left them to fawn over their child's drool on their own. GF was too nice.)", "No, it sounds like the parents have no manners. There are kinds of places, times of day, and groups that are appropriate for unrestricted baby behavior. This does not sound like it.", "Then keep your eyes to your plate or date or phone.  No one is forcing you to look.", "So don\u2019t?", "Ugh that would not be ok. My SIL let my nieces do that to my plate and I wasn\u2019t able to eat another bite after. Doesn\u2019t sound like the baby ate off anyone else\u2019s plate though.", "A teenager sucking on a piece of steak would be pretty gross.", "The kids are not Indian and they live in the United States, so it just means they weren\u2019t taught proper table manners.", "Exactly!  I'm not the biggest fan of kids, usually because they're not parented well and are noisy and disruptive, but a baby eating?  That's a nice quiet baby there!  :D", "Yeah, if it's \"grown up\" food that's even more attractive. :D", "I would assume the parents are much more familiar with their own child's ability to eat and how to properly prepare the food than the BIL's girlfriend. She's grossed by a baby eating. A baby eating is completely normal and an everyday occurrence, not something dangerous. She needs to get over herself. The world doesn't revolve around her.", "The 1 million followers Moon & Rue have on tiktok would say that nah, people think babies eating is cute.", "If you hate kids just say so. They were feeding their baby. The GF is NOT a family member. She's a GF. I'm sure the parents know what time their kid goes to bed and deemed it okay for baby to be out at that time.", "How is a baby eating not appropriate at a meal time? \n\nSo if someone eating a way I find causes me to be anxious and gross that makes them ah?", "Right. The title of the post makes you expect that, and I kept reading expecting that. Girlfriend must think babies are like the ones in old paintings where they're just miniature adults.", "That was immediately what I envisioned after reading their comment! *shudder*", "I know they aren't Indian. I was just mentioning that even locking your plates loudly isn't universally a bad thing.", "NTA. Does she have actual anxiety? So odd to be so focused on that.", "Babies are just fine. The abhorrent behavior was the parents'. It is also natural for babies to burp, fart, poop, scream, and grab things, and that is why parents with any manners mind their behavior in a restaurant, if they must bring them to an evening dinner.", "Yeah unless the baby is actually a child, it\u2019s to be expected. Babies are babies. Only starts getting gross around four because a lot of them are doing it on purpose for the attention.", "They were feeding their baby. How was their behavior abhorrent? Because they called out the GF's behavior as inappropriate?", "Here's a crazy idea: to feed a baby, put food in a dish, and the dish in front of the baby! It's worked for generations, really. Let other diners enjoy their experience. Live happily ever after."]}
