Share please??\"\n\nThat said he's a complete goblin right now who doesn't take \"no\" with grace yet so we don't take him places lol.", "Yeah our friends have a 1 y/o and 6 y/o. 6 ish good cause hes super picky so hed never want what everyone else is having. But 1 yo always wants to try what everyone else is having so friends often feel him stuff off their plates. Also 1 yo feeds the dog if he has his own plate full of food. Which is adorable until you realize  hes doing it every meal, so off moms plate it is! Honestly I hope BIL and gf dont want kids cause what OP describes sounds like typical baby behavior.", "My \u201cbaby\u201d is 5, and we usually share a meal because portion sizes are ridiculous. Sometimes we share a plate because the waiter/waitress either forgets or doesn\u2019t understand what I am asking for. Neither of us have died.", "Keep your eyes on your own plate if it bothers you.", "Honestly, yeah i was pretty shocked by how she did it the first few times because she was 14-15 months when she started and i prefer the begging like my cat over just grabbing whatever off my plate even as a toddler xD but she's been on track/ahead developmentally since she was born.", "Toddlers are fun. My cousin in law said to me \"be grateful when you can put your son down and he stays where he was placed because once they crawl/walk they are little demons and they don't like the word \"no\"", "Op says baby is 9 months old so very much a baby but also old enough for solid food. I\u2019m going with NTA, this is pretty normal in my opinion", "OP commented that her baby is 9 months old.", "Yeah, no.\n\nIf someone doesn't have table manners, I simply don't eat with them. Decline any invitations to where I'm gonna be witness to them eating, and don't invite them for any food-related activity either.", "ESH\n\nThe GF sucks for getting dinner with a baby and expecting anything else. I can\u2019t stand seeing/hearing very young children eat, so I avoid it. I have been put off my food by seeing babies do normal baby stuff like gumming on steak, but it\u2019s on me to not accept dinner invites with small children. Kids older than 4 or so however, I expect the parents to enforce some reasonable \u201cdon\u2019t eat gross\u201d manners. I\u2019m assuming your \u201cbaby\u201d is an actual baby. \n\nY\u2019all are *light* assholes for being baby-blind to what was probably a not-appetizing sight of a baby eating the way babies do, which can be pretty gross and noisy. I\u2019d advise you let this roll off your back, and in the future only get dinner with her when you don\u2019t have baby in tow as she may have misophonia.", "Well then don\u2019t invite babies to *your* birthday dinner. FWIW this wasn\u2019t even the girlfriend\u2019s birthday dinner.", "I'm not understanding the downvotes. We always made my son his own little plates from ours when we went out. Yes, even when he was a \"baby.\"", "Too anxious to watch a baby eat, but not too anxious to make a big deal about it and cause drama. Funny how that works.", "Absolutely.  Like food allergies and other mental health conditions (looking at you, OCD) it dilutes and detracts from the struggles many people face when people use it this way.", "Even at 16, i never commented on breast feeding mother's in public. I looked away because i didn't want to stare at a strangers boobs, but God if it bothers you so much don't LOOK. Baby needs to eat, for crying out loud", "Totally agree.  Now that you mention that, it's almost like a good response to a bratty older kid.  Snerk!", "Then don\u2019t go to dinner with a baby? The idea that the baby should just not eat dinner to accommodate the sensibilities of an ADULT is insanely self-involved.  OP and her family have the right to attend the dinner they were invited to, if SIL didn\u2019t like it then its on her to decline her own invitation.", "Eating is one thing, sucking on a piece of steak sounds disgusting, I\u2019m just imagining drool everywhere.", "I have a 2 year old and can confirm they can be really fucking gross while eating lol", "This is how they learn. They do not have the motor skills yet to use utensils so even if you give them a baby spoon, they prefer to use their fingers and hands. Is it messy-yes. That's why you make them wear the equivalent of a baby hazmat suit, put a sheet under a high chair and let them go to town. They are exploring the texture and feel of the food before they eventually put it in their mouths (or throw it on the ground or give it to the dog), It's an important learning stage.\n\nI'm sure that OP was holding the child while they ate so that most of the food ended up on her. At this stage of babyhood, everything goes into the mouth to see what it is.", "What I mean is they\u2019re harder to ignore when they\u2019re seven and actively being gross for attention. Plus they should know better by that age. Baby I can probably ignore, and even if not, that\u2019s kinda my problem and not the baby\u2019s.", "Right? My middle child got her first teeth at 4 months. She tolerated baby food for about 2 weeks, then decided she liked what we ate more.", "I have bad misophonia, too. I have to have background noise even when I eat at home with my family, or I have to eat in another room. However, I never had an issue with my babies or toddlers eating. They are too small to make much noise when they eat. Maybe it's just me. But I highly doubt that at a Mexican restaurant, which are usually pretty loud, that GF had a misophonia issue with a baby and not any of the adults at the table.", "Is it disgusting? Yes. Is it ok when a baby/cat/dog does it? Also yes. I think an infant counts as 'not a human being but a cute pet' category so unlike an adult I'm ok with a baby ducking a steak.", "Give him a frozen waffle.to. chew. Cold for gums, soaks up drool, and he likes hard bread lol", "Babies existing means drool everywhere. If that bothers you, you can solve that problem by not looking.\n\nBabies gnawing on steak like little cavemen is pretty adorable actually.", "Yeah, I also really doubt that was the problem there too. As you say, too much else going on. \n\n\n\nI think it's great that the kid was sharing the parents' food, growing up getting experiencing different foods etc.", "Is that a problem?", "Do you mind to PM me. I have my first and we\u2019re wanting to do blw. He\u2019s 5 months and we\u2019ve started doing bananas in the little pacifier thing for him to gum on. But I\u2019m having intense anxiety with how to do this.", "I love seeing babies eat Cheerios. They are just the right size for them to pick up with their tiny fingers and they can easily put them in their mouths.\n\nWhen I'm in a certain mood, I like to watch videos of babies eating. They get their little hands in the food and bring it to their mouths, not caring how messy they get. Sauce all over their mouths, eggs in their hair but they are happily feeding themselves. The mess is nothing a warm bath won't take care of.", "Is a baby a 9mo will probably touch and lick more than actual eat and is normal expecting it to just leave it is unrealistic even a bit older kids will lick it and try to share to be nice is absolutely wild compare the table manners with eating food with some baby saliva", "I wouldn\u2019t like it if 1 yo was eating off my plate, and I\u2019d feel pressured to share because everyone else is. Eating off parents\u2019 plates fine, but I wouldn\u2019t say eating off everyone else\u2019s plate is adorable.", "No the 1 y/o only ever eats off of parents plates. I feel that's pretty normal and also for safety reasons  I only ever let parents feed him. Sounds exactly like what op and husband did.", "For a 9 month old, the baby even seems very well-behaved. Mine is 10 months and enjoys smashing his food on the table a few times before eating it. \n\nNTA on OP though. While maybe it could seem concerning to people who haven't watched a baby eat before (I dunno, I honestly don't recall paying attention to babies eating before I had mine), this is like... how you feed babies as far as I know. Does SIL think that 9 month old babies are supposed to be on pur\u00e9es still or something?", "Did I read it wrong? Your comment says friends feed him too.", "NAH baby needs to eat, but I agree it can be gross looking when they smear, mash and grap. \n\nShe can\u2019t help if she squeamish, baby can\u2019t help they haven\u2019t learned proper table manners yet as they are, you know, a baby.\n\nYou could have suggested she moved so she wasn\u2019t facing your baby, that would have solved it.", "Yeah, because restaurant plates like to bounce and not shatter when thrown.", "They're gonna grab it anyways, my guy. And probably scream when you don't let them.", "My baby coughed directly into my open mouth yesterday. Unsanitary doesn\u2019t exist when it comes to sharing germs with your own baby.", "Even at 4 I still wonder how their hands are so grubby from eating a single cookie!", "Omg my daughter was the messiest eater! She would get whatever she was eating all over her & sometimes even managed to get it on her back.", "Heads up! When you have kids of your own you discover lotta stuff you thought was gross is just the way it is with infants and toddlers.", "I'm the same way. It's a strong, uncontrollable response that gets me irrationally upset and a little angry. I either 1. deal with it (look elsewhere, take a short walk to calm down, sit somewhere further from the loud/open-mouth chewer) or 2. don't eat with them anymore. My sister-in-law is a very loud chewer that eats very slowly (solid 45 minutes to an hour to finish a meal) and I just don't sit next to/across from her. If it gets really bad, I'll go to the bathroom or step outside. We'll remind her to keep her mouth closed but honestly there isn't a ton to be done about it in her case. I can't help that it causes a visceral reaction and she can't help but make some noise. But we respect each other and do our best.", "That's all a very good point. I had assumed that to not be the case here, with no mention of such sensitivities. If it *is* the case, I'd happily amend my take. Seems like this woman is just entirely unaccustomed to being around babies though, and has unrealistic expectations there since she's getting grossed out by completely normal baby stuff like grabbing food from the plate closest to them.\n\n> But the arsehole deciding factor is how a person then acts on their response.\n\nExactly, agreed. The fact that she was bothered is not AH, but the way she expressed it was.", "\"steak to suck on\" \n\nMy first thought was \"Uh huh, that baby knows what's up, and those parents are doing the right thing for that child's palate.\" Which, really, is the important thing here. I'm impressed at what this baby will willingly choose to eat on it's own, no \"picky eater\" there. The parents should just keep doing what they're doing.", "Eewwwwww!", "Of course, it does sound like the girlfriend needed a diaper change.", "No duh? That was a pretty pointless (and bordering on condescending) response. I literally said that I love babies and find it cute *when I\u2019m not trying to eat*. Shit filled diapers are also just the way it is with babies but a massive diaper blowout in front of me would absolutely still make me lose my appetite. It being \u201cjust the way it is\u201d doesn\u2019t suddenly mean it\u2019s not gross lmfao", "Same. Except its rice and refried beans on a tortilla. She only wanted rice and beans on tortilla. She eats other things now, but still loves rice and beans on a tortilla, lol.", "My nephew is early 30 and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s still all he eats!", "Expensive, might not reheat well, might not be going home right away...", "Oh man, I'm really sorry there's been so much struggle in your own journey. I'm really glad you were able to get your tongue tie released and find a great myo speech therapist! I hope it produces the results you're hoping for, or at the very least helps improve your prognosis. \n\nMy son's tongue tie wasn't discovered until he was 2, right around the time his sensitivity and vomiting started. We had it released by a pediatric specialists and we had to do the 4 weeks of lifts to prevent tissue regrowth too. I bet that wasn't fun to do to yourself! We had to wake up once a night and do them too, every 6 hours. He's been in speech therapy since then too and idk that they are the level of specialists you're seeing but they've been doing a good job and are what we have access to locally, without having to travel several hours. They've seen a lot of improvement and he's getting Occupational therapy too. So I feel like we are on a good path, even if it's not the final cure/solution to every struggle, he's improved a lot and we've got it under control pretty well considering. We'll always keep an eye on it and adjust as necessary and investigate new things if they come up, so I'm hopeful we were getting him off to a good start. \n\nThank you for all your kind words and I sincerely wish you the absolute best in your own journey!", "I'm not defending the girlfriend here, OP seems like a good mom-  but are you seriously unaware of how utterly moronic some parents are?", "Thanks, glad you got the point.", "Yellow box Cheerios are like the Gerber puffs in the sense that they melt well and are an appropriate size and texture for Little Ones. I\u2019ve tried a lot of the generics and organic brands and they are too big or too hard and so I stick to Cheerios bc they are the best!\n\nAnd I love this time of year bc they have heart shaped Cheerios for heart health awareness or something. I just think the hearts are so cute!!", "My brother and SIL are so devoid of curiosity that when their kids ask me \"what are you eating?\" (I'm the only vegetarian in the family, and apparently the country) and I say something like \"Houmous,\" the kids will look at their parents to see their reaction, parents will say \"Eeeww\" and make a face, and kids will do the same. Bro and SIL have never tasted houmous. \n\n\nTheir boys are 14 and 10 and won't eat anything except chicken nuggets, chips and pizza \n\nSeems like such a sad way to live", "you are very great parents i always love to hear when people especially because your probably from america and its harder than in my own european country been trough the whole healthcare system doing everything possible and everything that can help also great how you gave the kid his own way to manage his eating and reflexes. also to the person above lm glad youre also are fifuring it out a bit more by now. i know what its like to be sick and what its like to now know what it is for a long time physically and psychologically (childhood and later now teenagehood) its not easy and yall afe making it work pretty well for how its possible have all a really nice life:)", "depressing.  I was a picky eater until I met my husband, he kind of got me to explore and now I eat way, way better. \n\nI really didn't want a picky kid.  I've heard BLW stories where they still end up picky, but way less than \"normal\" feeding.

Feed baby off the parents plates then *clutches pearls* breastfeed in PUBLIC!", "My baby is 8 months old and no matter what kiddo eats it\u2019s always a mess.
