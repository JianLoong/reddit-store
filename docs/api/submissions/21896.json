Without even consulting me or anyone, almost immediately after she told us she was pregnant she basically started planning her own baby shower. Invitations, venue, theme, guest list, everything. Ok cool she\u2019s excited it makes sense, I guess. \n\nI am not very familiar with baby showers as I\u2019ve never been to one let alone thrown one. My mom reached out to me saying \u201cJust so you know, your sister is expecting you to throw this shower for her.\u201d Hmmmm ok. Sister never even asked me. But I figured it was the right thing to do to reach out to her and let her know I\u2019d be happy to help her with planning, sending invites, etc. \n\nBut she is planning basically everything herself ..but sending me links to stuff saying \u201chere\u2019s the venue let me know when you book it!\u201d Or \u201chere\u2019s the exact invitations I want let me know when you order them!\u201d Like Jesus H. Christ, that\u2019s tacky and entitled AF to me. SHE chose to have sex and get pregnant, why on Earth should the responsibility to pay for everything fall on anyone but her and her husband??? \n\nIm happy to help plan it but I told my mom I won\u2019t be paying for anything other than a gift. My mom said that\u2019s rude and as her only sister I should help out (my mom will be helping pay for the shower as well which I also don\u2019t agree with). \n\nI do make slightly more money than my sister (but with her and husband\u2019s income combined they make a little more than me) but unless I was crazy rich I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect someone else to cover these costs. Especially because I think a baby shower is stupid in the first place, like just send out an announcement and people will send gifts if they want to. I think expecting people to travel from out of state just to give you a gift in person all because you had sex (!!!!!) is insane. But people can do what they want so in that aspect I\u2019ve kept my mouth shut. \n\nAITA if I refuse to spend my own money on this baby shower?", "created_utc": 1689036939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wc45i/aita_for_not_wanting_to_spend_my_own_money_on_my/", "score": 1608, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she wants to plan it, and have all this expensive stuff, then she can pay for it.", "NTA, your sister sounds extremely entitled. Hosting and paying for a baby shower is something it's nice to *offer* to do for an expectant mother, it's not something the mom-to-be gets to demand of anyone else. That said, I'm wondering if your mom put the idea in her head? It sounds like your mom's the one pressuring you to do this, it's possible she gave your sister the impression you offered.", "NTA. Hosting a baby shower should be something you offer, not something asked of you. Also, a venue?! That\u2019s just absurd.", "Baby showers are typically not paid for by the guest of honor. \n\nHowever, they are also typically paid for voluntarily, so NTA.", "NTA I think paying/throwing a shower should be asked or you should ask to pay. Not told to do so. What you sister is doing is tacky.", "NTA. She's being rude and entitled. You are under no obligation to buy her a party, and PARTICULARLY not one where she has made all the spending decisions without consulting you. Tell her that you'd be happy to throw her a party, but if you do, it'll be in the party room at McDonald's. If she has bigger plans, she can pay for them herself. NO ONE gets to spend other people's money without permission.", "NTA. Before this goes any further you have to talk to your sister and make it clear you are not paying for the shower. Offer to help if you\u2019d like or say you are willing to contribute x amount instead of a gift, but you need to make it clear to her and not just your mom that you are not on the hook for the costs.", "NTA. Most people I know just did it at a relative\u2019s house so the only expense was for snacks and beverages. Unless you\u2019re rich no need to do it at a venue. E-vites work fine too. NTA.", "NTA - Baby showers are something that friends/relatives throw, not something that the one having the baby plans themselves. Still, not as bad as a gender reveal party though.", "Look, I\u2019m a guy, but I believe someone throws you a shower. You don\u2019t plan it yourself. So, if you said, \u201chey sis, I want to throw you a shower,\u201d then you should expect to pay for it. Seems like she\u2019s throwing it, and then looking for someone to cover it. NTA", "NTA - If she wants you to plan it, you a) need to consent to that first and b) get to pick out what you and your mom buy. She can add input, but shouldn't expect specifics since she's not paying. It sounds like she actually does want to plan it herself but wants you as the ATM.", "NTA\nIf you're *throwing the shower* you can choose a venue.  A lawn party is fine if the weather is good.   You don't need an expensive venue.  \nIf you're not throwing the shower than you should not have to pay for a venue someone else chose.", "So the way your sister is handling this, I would say NTA. She is planning this big expensive shower it sounds like and expecting people to foot the bill.\n\nYes typically close friends or family throw the expecting mom a shower but from my experience the mom respects the budget and hosts. \n\nHowever, your view on having kids and showers seems a little much. If that's your attitude you will take just don't go to the shower.", "Baby showers are typically nice get togethers thrown by the people closest to the expecting mom. A diaper party is held by the men. A venue for either is not uncommon. Potlucks are the norm. However the biggest thing is someone usually volunteers to do it and the expecting mother is hands off in the planning. You should probably ask for someone else to take over the planning as it really doesn't sound like something you're interesting in going to, let alone hosting. NTA. Good luck.", "NTA. Oh heck no!", "Not your baby, not your problem. NTA.", "NTA I am currently planning my own baby shower (it\u2019s at the end of the month.) My SIL & MIL are decorating and doing all of that but I am supplying them and did all the back work.

People have always looked at me like I\u2019m a monster when I\u2019ve said the same thing about baby showers!", "NTA. It\u2019s very presumptuous of her to assume you\u2019ll be footing the bill for her extravaganza.

Why should you pay for everything it doesn\u2019t make sense your the one who isn\u2019t pregnant here.", "NTA.  I don't know shower rules, but I know about life rules.  When someone volunteers you for something, don't say yes right away.  Find out every aspect of the responsibility.  Who pays, who does what.  Usually there is something off with it, otherwise they would not try to get you to do it.\n\nIt looks like this will costs hundreds, if not thousands.  This was not appropriate, tell your mom (who volunteered you) either she pays for everything or you are out of it period.", "Ask her what her budget is", "NTA. So the theme of this shower is \u201cShit show\u201d? Does she have friends or former bridesmaids to run this? There\u2019s an expression, \u201cHe who pays the Piper calls the tune.\u201d Yeah, Sis can plan all she wants but who\u2019s paying? Hate to leave her in the lurch but there\u2019s a complete lack of communication and commitment with the host. By the way, your dear Mother can host! A perfect match.", "NTA. Traditionally, it is bad manners for the guest of honor or someone in the guest of honor's immediate family to throw a bridal or baby shower - it's considered a present grab. Properly, it should be done by the bride's close friends, on a voluntary basis - the guest of honor does not get to order a gift grab on her behalf either.", "NTA of course you are not the arsehole. Your sister can ask if you\u2019d like to contribute but just assuming makes her TA.", "NTA. My DIL was insane as hell about it. 50 people were invited. She gave her sister the theme, requirements and threw a fit when I said no to hosting it and cooking for it.  No one else had room and thought I\u2019d rent a tent heaters etc to host outside \n\nI work 50 hours a week most weeks. Offered a venue and fresh baked pizzas and apps there. Her mother called me saying fathers parents are responsible for that. I asked if that meant she was paying for the balance of the wedding. \n\nShower came. And her mother asked loudly to the whole crew what I got for her\u2026 I present a small quilt I crochet myself. It was not the best stitch. I had taught myself after a crash course with a friend of mine. Took me months for little here little there. \n\nShe scoffed and said \u201cthat\u2019s it\u201d\u2026 laughed with her other daughter\u2026 I raised my eyebrow, made eye contact with my DIL and said\u2026 \u2018I paid the fucking bill\u2019.  Apparently her mother and sister said they\u2019d take care of everything\u2026 she didn\u2019t realize that meant fleecing her in-laws. \n\nAnd her mother wonders why I don\u2019t bother inviting them over when I host my gfs for mimosa brunch\u2026 ya know.. bc I want to have fun", "NTA \n\nMom wants this so bad, she can pick up the tab and host.", "NTA, it is not uncommon for the sister to host the shower. Most of the time it is in the home of a family member or friend.  Light lunch or just cake.  This is not a F-ing wedding, why a venue.", "ESH. Your sister for being presumptuous. And you and your mom for not communicating. Here\u2019s the deal, it is not appropriate for someone to hold their own baby shower. The idea is actually to be \u201cshowering\u201d the expecting mom with presents and ideally it should not be hosted by a grandparent to be. Could be hosted by a soon to be aunt or, ideally, a friend or cousin (I know, I know, weird etiquette rules from another century). Totally understand your perspective but I think the issue here is that your mom told you that your sister was expecting you to host and when you told your sister you would help she made the assumption that meant you would be hosting (e.g. paying). You aren\u2019t an AH for your perspective but your somewhat passive aggressive handling now. You need to nip this in the bud and have a conversation - probably best to do so with your mom since she is the one who started this mess. Hopefully your mom will step up and take control which would be ideal at this point.", "NTA, I threw my own shower for this reason.", "NTA, you need to tell her straight up that you cannot afford this. You can help address the envelope invitations, but not pay for them. You can help decorate the venue that she paid for with the decorations that she paid for.

I'd refuse on that principle alone - your mom can do it if she wants.\n\nYou can call a restaurant with an \"event room\" and ask if you can have a baby shower there. That's what my family does. just make it clear everyone is paying for themselves on the invite.", "NTA", "NTA your sister is unbelievable", "NTA. She's not entitled to you throwing her a baby shower and she didn't even ask.", "NTA", "NTA. I mean, they're celebrating the fact that she's going to have a child, not that she had sex...you seem a little too focused on someone banging your sister", "NTA - baby showers are fucking stupid and expecting people to financially support your life decisions is entitled af.", "You people on here have some fucked up asshole families. No!!! You're not the asshole. Fuck your sister and mom.", "NTA for not wanting to pay for the shower yourself especially when she seems to be doing all the planning. That\u2019s bizarre. It usually isn\u2019t on the guest of honor to throw the shower but she seems to be taking that role on herself (I will admit I helped plan my own baby shower - ex. booking the free event space at our apartment complex - to help out my friends/family). \n\nBut honestly your attitude makes me think you\u2019re an A H. How many times do you need to reiterate a \u201cparty is being thrown because someone chose to have sex\u201d. I mean yes, technically, I guess. But you sound like an ass. Baby showers are very common events thrown to welcome a new addition to the family and celebrate a life transition. All life big transitions are hard and can be anxiety inducing, even when the person wanted it and is genuinely excited about it, whether it\u2019s having a baby, getting married, moving to a new place, ending a long term relationship, changing your career or getting a promotion, etc. I really hope you treat your sister in a more compassionate and empathetic way than you come across in this post.", "NTA and the way you worded this is hilarious", "NTA - Is this a common thing in the states?\n\nWhere I'm from I've never heard of family members being expected to pay for your baby shower.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for not wanting to pay for the baby shower as that is messed up and entitled on your sisters part especially without even talking to you. She doesn\u2019t have a right to push that on you. I do think maybe there\u2019s some resentment but it\u2019s a societal thing where people genuinely like to celebrate new life coming in so they throw a party and give a gift as a way to help the new parent. You\u2019re kind of TA for the way you view celebrating new life in my opinion", "Wow \ud83d\ude2e YTA!! Not saying drop a grand in her lap, but a baby shower is pretty normal.

I didn\u2019t get a choice in having my first, it was planned with my input as it\u2019s normal to have one for the first.

You should give her a baby shower. Very sisterly thing to do. However, your sister needs to back off and let you decide the budget, venue, food, etc. If your sister wants to plan every detail, then she can fund it.", "ESH - i think you've both fundamentally misunderstood what showers are supposed to be. Typically, the mother, aunts, and other family are the ones who plan and pay for the shower. Sister should not be dictating so heavily the exact details of the shower- essentially,  the shower is the gift that the family is giving to your sister. It's rude to not allow the giver to choose the gift they want to give. At the same time,  throwing the shower means you are paying for the shower.  If you don't want to contribute monetarily towards the shower more than just bringing a single gift from the registry- you should not be throwing the shower. Sister and your mom will probably be annoyed with you backing out though.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't asked.  Your sister decided to play the Entitlement Card and is trying to make you pay for very costly things.  Custom invitations alone run into the hundreds.  It's not a wedding, they're expecting a baby.  Baby showers should only be for local friends and family, or within a close proximity, in my opinion.  I totally agree with you to not make a big deal out of it.  You don't force someone to pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars, if they're not comfortable with doing so.  Your money is not hers to spend.  She wanted this, she can pay for it.  Showers of any kind are hosted by someone who offers, not the expectant parents to demand someone else to do for them.", "NTA, they could have at least asked you.\n\nYour sister is likely the over-organized kind, and thinks she\u2019s doing you a favor by finding these things. However, if you and your mom are going to be on the hook financially, you need to sit down with your sister and have a realistic conversation. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty standard to expect family to throw you a shower. First time parents usually need one, even if they\u2019re well off- there\u2019s a whole room and new person to take care of. Showers, both bridal and baby, are intended to help people transition into a new (expensive) stage of life.\n\nWhile it\u2019s definitely funny and true to view it as \u201ccelebrate someone having sex!\u201d, take a second and remember that your sister is probably freaking out internally at the moment.

His family may help pay for stuff too, they mentioned helping and haven\u2019t actually done so yet, we\u2019ll see.

I love celebrating life milestones with my family and friends but it is unreasonably expensive to those who are on a single income.", "Ok, so baby showers are weird. This is because they have a guest of honor. As with all parties, it is considered tacky for a person to throw a party honoring themselves. Especially when gifts are expected. \n\nThis is why you have to have someone step in and throw the party *for you*. This is then a double-boost, because now you have someone in your life who likes you enough to honor you, which is apparent to all your friends and acquaintances. (*That's* why she didn't ask you directly, she needed you to volunteer, and in cases where you don't, others are used to suggest it.)\n\nModern society has gotten this twisted up and a bit extra complicated. Now, people have smaller social networks, so they've gotten a bit lax on who can be the one doing the honoring, opening it up to certain family members (cousins and sisters in law are great, sisters are iffy, moms a no)\n\nThere's also an acknowledgement that the guest of honor should have *some* say so they will enjoy their own party, but occasionally this has taken off into them basically planning the whole thing, and the \"host\" being a symbolic figure head and helper.\n\nIt is, however, now understood that the more say the mom to be has over the planning, the more she should contribute to the funding of the party. Which is generally done discreetly, via passing it through the future grandma or friends or whomever. Like you are seeing. Your mom is contributing money. But, a host (aka you) should be contributing something, since they're the host. Again, it's about honoring the mom to be.\n\nSo, on the whole, your sister is following modern etiquette for these things and has behaved within the expected guidelines.\n\nYou're just not \"getting\" it, which I'm guessing is frustrating everyone involved, from your mom to your sister. They are attempting to perform the age-old dance of ritual, and you're standing off on the sidelines saying it's stupid. They can't throw it themselves, and you're not cooperating.\n\nOn the whole, I want to say YTA\n\nYOU agreed to host this party, so you need to follow through and not be a sourpuss asshole about it as you do. \n\nThis means you say \"I am willing to pay $xx towards this, and here are my plans for food and activities.\" If she doesn't like it, wants more, or wants extra people, then she will tell your mother, who will help you make adjustments and give you the money to do so.", "NTA\n\nPlan your own version of a baby shower. Tell her any aditional expenses that you've planned she can upflgrade with her own finances.\n\nMake your plan your or your mothers place (how sentimental! Mother to mother!

Food can be something you could pay for, but just do like 2 pizzas or something and split each one 16 ways. BYOB.\n\nNow, if she wants fancy invitations? She can pay for it.

If you love your sister and have the financial means to do so, throwing her a shower is a lovely way to show it. Babies are expensive and a shower is a nice way to support the family, even if you yourself are not a baby person. It's no different than buying someone a housewarming gift because they bought a new house/moved, a wedding gift when the get married or a graduation present. Just because you may choose not to partake in those life events doesn't mean that you shouldn't support and celebrate those who do. I'm child-free and a broke graduate student, but you can bet when my sister was pregnant last year I flew across the country and threw her the most lovely baby shower I possibly could, because I love her to bits and wanted her to have that celebration. \n  \nThat being said, your sister shouldn't be attempting to control or demand anything reguarding her own shower, from venue to invites.

Of course these were cheaper venues chosen by the host. The people I knew who were well off, hosted catered baby shower events in their homes and could and did comfortably host 30 or more. Having it in a venue isn't really the problem here, the problem is that what sister wants is to host it herself and for OP to pay the bill. OP does not really want to host at all, and if she is going to reluctantly do so wants to be in control of the budget as it is her money. The host SHOULD be in control of the budget. If sister wants specific people that her family may not know, like a college or work friend, invited - that's a normal level of input. If sister requests, oh can it please be elephant themed, like my nursery and then the host decides what to do from there - also a normal level of input. Picking out the exact  invites, venue, decor, etc, is NOT a normal level of input.", "How many people? That's  nuts.", "Family doesn't throw baby showers. She's using you. She doesn't get to assign you the job and tell you to pay for it. Call her and tell her that you're not paying for her fantasy party. She can get her friends to pay for it.

Big enough that there were atleast 4 other parties going on in other parts of it. No event was right on top of each other either.

There are acceptable inexpensive options, like meeting for lunch at a local restaurant with the expectation that guests foot their own checks and maybe the family takes care of the check for the mom-to-be.\n2) You're entitled to not liking the idea of a baby shower, but it's hard to get sympathy when you keep saying it's a celebration of your sister's sex. Focus on the \"someone thought I'd foot a couple hundred dollar budget for a massive shower\" angle. You don't have to like kids, but kids can't help existing. \n3) The best response? Get mom and sister together. Sit them down and explain calmly that you cannot throw a massive event-style babyshower that she plans at your expense. Pull up the links to the venue and invitations in front of them and let the dollar values sink in. Offer to be a part of organizing something more reasonable like mentioned before. \n\nMy rating? ESH. Your sister for expecting you to foot the bill for a huge party, mom for her seeming ignorance in the matter which is likely on purpose, and you for the way you're turning it all down. Focus on the financial angle, not the weird obsession with a party because two people had sex.", "NTA\n\nIt's extremely poor etiquette to plan her own baby shower, and even poorer etiquette to hand over the bill for someone else to foot.

Apparently I\u2019m in the minority, but showers aren\u2019t thrown by the people being showered. Since your sister is having a baby, someone else is supposed to throw the shower. It makes sense that it would be a joint effort from you and your mom as y\u2019all are the closest relatives to your sister, but technically anyone could do it. Your sister sucks for wanting an expensive shower. I\u2019d talk to her and try and pair down her expectations. You can do things with her theme in mind that aren\u2019t expensive invites and a luxe venue. I\u2019ve personally never been to a shower of any kind that wasn\u2019t at someone\u2019s house, but I understand that\u2019s not an option for you, so maybe look into having it at a community center or church or something. \n\nImo you\u2019re being a negative AH about something that\u2019s supposed to be a joyous time in your sisters life, with all your comments you just sound like someone who\u2019s self-centered and refuses to be happy for others. (Comments being \u201cwhy should people buy HER a present for having sex??\u201d Idk very \u201cwhy isn\u2019t this about me\u201d energy). \n\nI guess it depends on your guest list, but most people don\u2019t travel (far) for a shower, they\u2019ll just mail the gift, so I wouldn\u2019t worry about the out of town guests as much, unless you know that they would travel out of state for this, which again depends on your guest list. idk I wouldn\u2019t (and haven\u2019t) traveled for a shower except for my sister or like 2 friends, but even then I\u2019d only go if I could easily work it into my work schedule.\n\nBesides renting a venue, what exactly does she want you to pay for? Imo you can make invites on Shutterfly or canva based on the invites sister sent you, and you could even do e cards to save more money. Plus other than that there will be games, which are usually easy to DIY, and snacks/finger foods which you can make yourself or buy from the grocery store when you get your final guest count. Decor items, like balloons or a sign or something are also pretty cheap from party supply stores. \n\nTLDR; sister is ta for expecting a lavish party at others\u2019 expense, you\u2019re ta for refusing to pitch in any money for a shower at all (a normal amount, nta for not wanting to spend $1,000s)", "NTA.

Someone should want to do this for you and volunteer to do it. For my sister, we actually split the costs between different family members and everyone brought different food to help mitigate costs.
