And the fact that you and he are peers, you\u2019re not some sort of support staff tasked with feeding the crowd? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole either way, but I\u2019m curious whether John is a jerk or just clueless and kind of tactless?", "NTA but I would be petty and stop bringing snacks in. When people ask, say you were getting grief from an unnamed coworker. Said coworker will have most likely complained in small chat to others, and therefor outing themselves.", "NTA\n\nHe has a job and can buy his own snacks. What a mooch!", "Info:\nDoes he know you pay with your own money?\nAlso, why not expense it?", "Info: Did John know the snacks were purchased by you? Perhaps he assumed they were paid for with company funds?", "NTA\n\nThe old saying isn't just a saying, it's a rule - \"Beggars can't be choosers\"", "NTA. it's nice when you do things like this for everyone and one person ruins it for everybody. \n\nDid he come and apologize to you afterwards? \n\nNext time, if he comes by and before he says anything you should say, \"I don't have pretzels so get your own\"", "NTA. Dude's an entitled prick.\n\nIf something like this happens again, though, you might want to say something earlier, like. \"I pay for this with my own money, but you're welcome to contribute,\" instead of biting your tongue while he keeps pestering you.

Like you said if he wants the pretzels that much he is welcome to bring them to contribute to the communal snack tray.", "NTA...you simply presented the most logical solution. It should have occurred to him without you saying it. Hopefully the message sinks in.", "I would just hide the snacks from this guy \ud83d\ude2d that would probably make you more of TA but we kinda do the same thing at my work with some customers. I work at a place with the gaming/gambling machines, and we have a free little basket of chips free for them to snack on while they play the machines. We have a few select people that always complain about the snack selection but that doesn't stop them from taking them and shoving extras in their pockets or purses as well. Sometimes we see these customers pull up and just grab the snack basket and hide them in the stock room until they leave.", "NTA - but INFO...why do you do this? This is exactly what happens when you try to be nice in an office", "I used to do this with a bowl of mini-sized candy to encourage others to get used to coming in my office so that they would feel comfortable approaching me when something was going wrong and they really needed to.   Until one day, one man came into my office, didn't speak to or look at me, rifled aggressively through the bowl, then huffed, 'you don't even have my favorite', threw up his hands, turned on his heel and left.\n\nYou can be sure after that, I ate all his favorites myself first.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nFree snacks are free snacks, John doesn't need to eat them. He should either be grateful for what's provided or bugger off entirely.", "NTA - you are not a snack bar! Maybe he will stop coming by. Or, he will bring them to share with others.", "NTA - The request once already reeks of entitlement but was ultimately harmless. To keep it going is at most-generous a running gag that you grew tired of, but sounds more like someone who needed to be put in his place.", "NTA but I do think you should've said something earlier. That said, hindsight is 20/20. \n\nIf he's usually not a jerk, I would give him the benefit of the doubt about knowing you paid for this with your own money. And, yeah, it's okay that he felt a little uncomfortable. Hopefully it will pass.", "NTA\n\nBeggars can't be choosers.", "NTA... They're free snacks for God's sake!  Why look this gift horse in the mouth?", "NTA\n\nYou're providing treats for the office out of the kindness of your heart, with your own money. It's easy to get annoyed when someone keeps expecting you cater to there own needs. \n\nAlthough I am wondering from his reaction, if he knew you were buying the treats out of pocket, and thought there was some group fund going toward them. Which in this case makes him TA for wanting a pricey treat and not putting anything toward it himself.", "he wants them, he can buy them. He's not entitled to anymore of you're hard earned money than he is already taking NTA", "NTA\n\nThese are free. You're doing something out of kindness. You're not a chef, you don't have to take his food requests. If he brings it up again, tell him to fuck off", "NTA. Used to do this with candy until someone complained that I never had his favorite.

Because she's been doing it over a year and enjoys it and this very mild conflict is the first issue that's arisen?", "Eh, depends on the office.

Then at night the candy would disappear.  I would leave in the evening with a 1/2 bowl and return in the morning with a bowl with a single piece of candy.  Then I started putting it in a drawer at night but that did not fool anybody and they still emptied the bowl.  Turned out it was the kids of one of the senior managers and he would send them over to my desk to keep them busy.", "This just reads like some sad office quirky person who lures people into talking to them with snacks - it it's altruistic then just leave them in a common area. I don't get why anyone would spend their own money, every day, to provide food for an office when a jerkwad like that was an inevitable situation.", "I can\u2019t comment on why OP would do this, but I assume they keep the snacks in their own office to prevent the office ahole from taking them all home.

If he ever brings it up again, I'd tell him that you are buying these with your own money, you have a set budget, and his special pretzels are well beyond that.  He's certainly welcome to purchase some for the office to share.", "Psh. I\u2019m an introvert and I have a big candy bowl on my desk for my coworkers.

People knowing you pay for it yourself does not stop some from demanding you buy what they want. Incredible but true.", "NTA. What an entitled jerk. Put out a tip jar that reads \"Snack money funds. The more you give, the more you get\". Stop paying if he's going to complain. And BTW, let HR know that he's complaining about what you buy with YOUR MONEY to give coworkers snacks. He may think that the office gives you money to buy the snacks.", "NTA If John wants Auntie Anne's pretzels or whatever he can go buy some with his own money.", "Yup, or tell him to stop being a demanding hog.", "This is a great response and one OP should utilize. It would clear up any misunderstanding that she\u2019s taking requests and firmly shut down any entitled complaints about a preferred snack not being available.", "NTA, but maybe you should explain the situation to him", "NTA he\u2019s uncomfortable because he\u2019s realised he\u2019s been overstepping this whole time and is just now being told about it.
