You also conveyed in a calm manner your feeling to your mum. NTA and I hope you will get the help you need.", "NTA. This man has known you less than six months and somehow thinks he knows enough about your mental health to try and guide you. Most of what he knows he only knows from what your mother has said. Then, when his comment visibly upset you, your mom did not try to defend you or even talk it out. She tried to hug you to de-escalate the situation to keep her man happy. You don't need what is basically a stranger trying to tell you how to handle your own mental health.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you did the best thing for your health at the time (excluding smoking).\n\nAnd in what world does a guy who is cheating on his wife feel in the right to start lecturing a kid he doesn't know? Maybe you should tell him to stay out of your family matters, or you might feel the urge to get involved in his.", "NTA that man stepped out of line and your mom just let it happen as if he was your father figure for a long time. Good for you for walking away from a toxic situation. I hope your mom wises up.", "Clearly the man who is fucking around on his wife is the best person in the world to lecture others on their choices. /s\n\nNTA.

To break it down: your mom wants the man, who is having an affair with her, to have an opinion, and be actively involved in your life - and not just your life, your mental health.  \n\nLet your mom know that what she is asking of you is inappropriate.  Sharing your private, intimate details with him is not ok. He is not her boyfriend, he is not her partner, he is not a permanent fixture in her life, hell, he is not even committed to her and unless he is it is not ok for her to share your personal information with this man.  To you he is a stranger, and rightfully so.  You are 100% correct. There is no \u201cwe\u201d, and she needs to draw a line.  Make it very clear that you do not consent to your information to be shared with this man. And any decisions about you and your health will be dealt only between you and your mom. \n\nQuite frankly, as a mom, I am appalled by this on your behalf. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. Your mom needs figure some things out.  Having an affair with a married man is not ok. For many reasons. And putting you in the middle of it is disgusting.  Do you have another adult you\u2019re close with that you can confide in? I feel like someone else needs to know this is going on. If his wife finds out, and things go badly, it could get really ugly for your mom, or you.  Your mom is acting irresponsible and you need more support than she is willing to give you.", "NTA - This man crossed the line and your mom support that", "Nta\n\nYour mum feels insulted by you leaving an uncomfortable situation but not by her bf making an uncomfortable situation? \n\nShe's picking her bf over her child.
