To break it down: your mom wants the man, who is having an affair with her, to have an opinion, and be actively involved in your life - and not just your life, your mental health.  \n\nLet your mom know that what she is asking of you is inappropriate.  Sharing your private, intimate details with him is not ok. He is not her boyfriend, he is not her partner, he is not a permanent fixture in her life, hell, he is not even committed to her and unless he is it is not ok for her to share your personal information with this man.  To you he is a stranger, and rightfully so.  You are 100% correct. There is no \u201cwe\u201d, and she needs to draw a line.  Make it very clear that you do not consent to your information to be shared with this man. And any decisions about you and your health will be dealt only between you and your mom. \n\nQuite frankly, as a mom, I am appalled by this on your behalf. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. Your mom needs figure some things out.  Having an affair with a married man is not ok. For many reasons. And putting you in the middle of it is disgusting.  Do you have another adult you\u2019re close with that you can confide in? I feel like someone else needs to know this is going on. If his wife finds out, and things go badly, it could get really ugly for your mom, or you.
