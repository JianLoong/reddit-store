I know this is a very hard situation.  You need to sit down with your dad and have a conversation.  Start out by saying that you want him to let you talk and to listen to comprehend, not react.  Then you need to tell him that you can't be Molly's replacement.  That you want to have him love you for who you are and not as the 2nd Molly.  Tell him how you felt when others didn't realize he had another daughter.  And if you feel comfortable tell him if this doesn't change and he doesn't get help for his grief he will end up losing another daughter.  Try and do this when your stepmother is not around.  Then you need to be willing to listen the same way about how he is feeling.  He needs therapy, you might need it to handle this emotional time as well and then you guys need it together to be able to work through the years of resent and hurt.  \n\nI wish you the best and know none of this is your fault!", "NTA and your father really needs therapy because he is experiencing what is called \"complicated grief\" when the grief is adversely impacting his relationship with other family members and goes on for an extended period of time.\n\nI understand grief over a child dying as my brother died and my parents never truly got over it but I never felt guilty for being a survivor. If anything my parents were the reverse of your father because many people who met them later in life didn't know they had a child who died because when asked they would say they had one child (me) because they didn't want to deal with explaining the death of a child.", "NTA.  Your dad needs serious therapy as he hasn't come to terms with his grief in 9 years which is too long.  He needs a wakeup call to get therapy and hopefully you yelling at him is it.\n\nedit: 9 years when OP was born and OP is 15 years so a total of 24 years till this post.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re dad is clearly still grieving and that\u2019s ok, but it\u2019s not ok for him to neglect who you are as an individual. I think the important context here is that molly passed away over 20 years ago at this point. He shouldn\u2019t be mistaking your names or failing to fulfill promises (six flags) because he is prioritizing her (gravestone). I think some family therapy would go a long way", "NTA\n\nI think you need to talk to your stepmother, actually.  As calm as you can, tell her that it isn't just about the Eeyore squishmallow, that it's like this with everything.  He gives you gifts that were for Molly, he calls you Molly, his co-workers don't know you exist but they know about Molly.\n\nTell her that to him, you aren't Charlie, you're Molly 2.0.\n\nAnd when someone tells you \"sorry for your loss\", just say \"it was 24 years ago\".", "You shouldn't have to live in your dead sister's shadow. NTA.", ">my stepmom told me i was being a bitch and it was just a stupid toy\n\nOh no, this is not about the toy, the toy was just the last straw. This is about your father forcing you to live in the shadow of his dead sister since you was born. The fact that he constantly denies it, makes me think he's delusional and need help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, of course.", "NTA\n\nI know this will be very difficult, but you need to sit down with your dad and really talk about what's going on and how these events make you feel. He is obviously having difficulties and has a blindspot due to the pain of missing his first daughter.\n\nHe needs to be made aware that he has a daughter (YOU) who is living and he is missing out on your LIFE and a strong father daughter relationship, because of his grief. I don't know him, but I want to believe he wouldn't purposely treat you like this.\n\nI suggest you have someone with you when you have this discussion, someone who understands the dynamics, if that is possible. Maybe an aunt or uncle who you are close with, that know what your dad is going through, but also has seen first hand how things have affected you.\n\nIf you don't have anyone like that, or don't feel comfortable, at the very least write a letter to him to get your thoughts and feelings out.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad needs grief counseling.  You're not Molly.  You're your own person and he should love and cherish you for it.  He doesn't even mention you to his coworkers!?!  And now he's distancing himself from you because you don't have strong emotional feelings about a person you never met?!\n\nWhile I'm sorry for his loss, his behavior makes him the big AH here.", "NTA. People need to learn how to grieve before they have more kids. Sucks his daughter died but he's gonna be out two daughters if he keeps this up.", "NTA.  At all.  As others have said, your dad needs therapy.  A lot of it.  Family therapy might be in order as well, so you can explain to him why it hurts so much, what he does.  \n\n\nETA - can you go live with your mom?  I don't know your situation, but if that could be a better option, you should take it.", "NTA he needs therapy. Do your best in school and get out of there. Go very low contact with him.", "NTA kiddo. I'm so sorry you are living with this. Your father is TA and needs some serious professional help.", "Nta it sounds like he needs to seek help to come to terms with you not being her", "NTA. Grief is hard, but it's your dad's responsibility to deal with it in a way which doesn't make your life all about someone else.\n\nI could understand getting your names switched occasionally - these things happen, my mum has called me by my brother's name before and we're not even the same gender, just in the same category of 'her kid' - but in combination with the rest of it I can see how it's definitely grating to you. And the rest of it isn't ok at all.", "oh honey. I'm sorry for all of you. NTA", "Is he a reasonable, affectionate dad otherwise? Because if he is I would show him this post. You sum up the situation very well. Maybe don't tell him you posted this on Reddit, say you wrote it to clear your thoughts or something.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your dad needs therapy. Sorry love, I can\u2019t imagine how tough this must be.", "NTA she passed 9 years before you were born, and it sounds harsh but he can't force you to feel an emotional attachment to someone you didn't actually have a relationship with personally.\n\nI get it to an extent. Every birthday you have past the age of 6 he probably wonders what she would have been like at your age, what she would have been into etc. It's not however right for him to project that on to you and get you gifts *she* would have liked. \n\nYou need to have a conversation with him and make it clear that you can't continue to have everything in your life linked to Molly. You're your own person and it's not fair to you to have your whole childhood made about her.", "You are not Molly. You will never be Molly. She was her own person, as are you and he needs to understand that. He needs some grief counselling and therapy, if after 20+yrs he is still struggling.\n\nMaybe he thinks this is a way to bring you closer to her/her memory. But its hard to do that if you've never met her and the only way he's doing it is through your birthdays/gifts.\n\nYour not TA for your feelings and he's not one for his feelings being hurt. You've apologised, but give it time, maybe he's realised what he is doing isn't fair to you or Molly. You both would probably benefit from therapy together going forward. NAH", "NTA - your dad might never fully process his grief...i'm sorry for that. \n\nYour dad doesn't hate you...he's hurt.  That's ok...he'll get over it.  I really think you all might need some family counseling so you have a safe place to be able to explain your point of view in all of this (it is very hard to compete with a dead person) and he has the professional help to hopefully get to a better place surrounding his 1st daughter's death without putting so much of his feelings on you.", "NTA. I think he needs some help understanding your feelings as his daughter. I personally don't understand his feelings and never will but he doesn't see your side either. I'm sorry that you'll need to be the more emotionally mature one.maybe some group therapy to get it all out there. You should priority over a long dead sibling.", "Hold on! Your stepmom called you a bitch? Girl did you sock her in the face? And I get your side about not having a sister bc you didn\u2019t grow up with her or even know her! But man that stepmom.. hell no", "NTA.  \n\nAlso- I feel it's important to validate your feelings- you are NOT crazy and **you are NOT overreacting.**  \n\nAny ONE of the things he did, on their own, would be fine, easily explainable.  But put together into a pattern it gets fucking creepy, like he's trying to turn you into his Molly or somehow merge the two of your memories together or have you pick up where she left off or something.  \nI don't think it's malicious at all.  I doubt he even realizes he's doing it.  It's how he's *reacting* to his loss.  But it's a reaction.  It means he hasn't processed the loss, hasn't accepted it fully.  \n\nThat you were alive for 10+ years and *he never told his coworkers about you* is a serious problem.  It shows he's hung up on Molly, not you.  Especially since (if my math is right) she died almost 25 years ago.  \n\nSo here's what I'd do in your shoes.  \n\nI'd go to him and ask to talk for a few minutes.  Say you need to say some things and ask him to please listen and not interrupt.  Wait for him to agree.  \n\nTell him you love him.  Tell him he's a great dad and you're glad he's your dad.  Tell him you always want him to be happy.  Tell him you know he loves you, and you know he loves Molly.  And you never, ever, want to sour that memory for him because you know he misses Molly.  \n\nBut you want him to understand- you aren't Molly.  And while that may seem obvious when you say it, many of the little things he does are innocent on their own but put together they form a pattern.  That pattern suggests he wishes you were Molly, like he's trying to turn you into Molly.  Tell him that's not an accusation or an attack, but it IS how his actions have made you feel.  You aren't saying this to make him feel bad, just as you know he doesn't always talk about Molly to make you feel inadequate.  But it's important to be honest with each other, because that's what people who trust each other do.  \n\nWhat specifically bothers you-- how he always tells everyone his daughter died.  Yes, Molly died, but you're very much alive and you're his daughter too.  Why does he always say 'my daughter died when she was six' and not 'my daughter is 15, here she is?'.  And for 14 years he's been working with people telling them all his daughter's dead, and said nothing about you.  Why not?  That makes you feel awful, like you're unworthy of mention outside the immediate family.  Have you not once done anything that brings joy to his heart?  Not once ever done something that made him proud enough to want to share your existence with his coworkers?  You feel like he's ashamed of you, or doesn't want to acknowledge to the world that you exist and ARE his daughter now.  \n\nYou feel he's wrapped up his whole identity in Molly, like he isn't 'hisname', he's 'hisname, father of deceased Molly'.  You want him to be 'hisname, father of Charlie' too, and a lot of the time you feel he doesn't see himself that way.  You feel maybe he got so hurt when Molly died, he never fully accepted that he now has a new daughter.  \n\nSay again that you never, ever want to tarnish his memory of Molly.  But you also want to make some new memories with him, HAPPY memories.  And you want those memories to be 'Dad and Charlie having fun together', not 'Dad missing Molly, and Charlie is here too'.  \n\nSo to that end, you want to go to therapy with him.  You want to have as good a relationship with him as you can, and you feel like for that to happen he needs to finish grieving for Molly and start living in the moment with the daughter that's in front of him, begging to be part of his identity like Molly is.  And you want to help that process if you can and support him in his loss, so you and he can do it together.  You hope very much that he's willing to try, because you love him.", "In my opinion, you are NTA.\n\nHowever, I do think you need to take it easy on your dad as he is apparently having a really hard time with it. Losing a grandparent can be hard if you are close, but you said you weren't. However, a parent losing a child... that is in a completely different league.\n\nFrom your perspective, its only been you and your dad. From your dad's perspective he had 6 years with a daughter who then died in some fashion. How that happened also plays a role. He expects you to want to feel a connection with your sister because he is hurting. The problem is that you cannot have a connection with someone you never met before. You have every right to be hurt and upset especially how he talks about Molly at work with people but not about you?\n\nAs a father I can understand how your dad feels sort of. I have not lost a 6 year old but we did have a miscarriage and it was not easy even though we never met him or her. I think you have every right to feel as you do but you also need to have empathy for your dad.\n\nI suggest talking to him about how he had a daughter and how sorry you are for what happened but that happened nearly a decade BEFORE you were born so you cannot really relate to how he is feeling but that you are here and alive and you need him. Chances are that his grief is blinding him to his own actions towards you. tell him how it hurt that coworkers didnt even know about you and that you want him to see you and care about you. \n\nI also agree with your dad about the picture in the locket, however, you can still put your picture next to it, or maybe over it which puts the sisters together. I am sorry you are feeling as you do but if talking is not going to help, write him a letter. address everything upsetting you about the situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your dad is so distraught over the loss of your sister that he can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. He really really needs to seek therapy. You aren\u2019t her. I have a feeling he\u2019s always treated you this way and you\u2019re just now old enough to understand this is going on. I\u2019m so sorry. It doesn\u2019t excuse his behavior. But yes. He really needs therapy to cope bc it doesn\u2019t sound like he ever did. It screams mental health that she\u2019s been dead almost 25 years and he\u2019s putting a headstone in his back yard.", "NTa\n\n\"If you think this is about a stupid toy,   try harder.\" Because you shouldn't tell an adult they are stupid.", "Nta", "NAH I don\u2019t think your dad has bad intentions and it doesn\u2019t sound like he is actually doing anything to harm you. I can see how you are annoyed but you did have a sister who passed away,", "NTA Send this post to your dad and your stepmom. You never should\u2019ve apologized. They are the ones that I owe you the biggest apology ever. Especially your dad but your stepmom had no right to call you that. You need to be blunt with your dad and ask him why he doesn\u2019t care about you ask him why you have had to leave in the shadow of your sister your entire life? Ask him when he\u2019ll ever love you for you. Flat out tell him you don\u2019t know if you will ever forgive him for all of the hurt he has caused you and he should be ashamed of himself", "NTA. Your stepmother is out of place for calling you a bitch. She\u2019s the bitch. Your father is still grieving and it is unfair for him to block you out as a person and be fixated on Molly.", "NTA.  Dad need to go to therapy.", "NTA: he needs some help.  You are not Molly and if she does 9 years before you were born he should still not be acting like that.", "NTA\n\nYour father needs help. Yelling at him was probably not the best response, but I understand where you are coming from and don't blame you. \n\nI have the feeling you never had a good talk about this, but I could be wrong. I hope you can reconcile and make your father understand that you are not Molly. That it hurts you the way he treats you this way. That you need him as a father and that he should be there for you. As I have the feeling that if this continues, he may lose his other daughter as well. \n\nGrief is a difficult process and everybody grieves in their own way and time. But the way your father is grieving is not healthy. Not for him or for you. As others also mentioned. I would suggest family therapy as his 'obsession' with Molly has also greatly impacted you and your relationship with your father. I hope things work out...", "As someone who loves Sanrio in general they have those squish mellows all over the place he\u2019s trying to to turn you into someone your not because of his grief hope you can live with someone different who treats you like your own person not your dads other child NTA", "NTA - please plan to leave the house as soon as you can.  It is not a healthy environment for you.", "So for a decade and a half, your father has called you by the wrong name, not told people about you, given you Molly\u2019s old things and purchased things Molly would like (but not you) for you-you your Step Mom is calling YOU the b**ch? \n\nI don\u2019t think so. \n\nNTA. But your dad and step mom sure are.", "This poor child. \n\nNTA, and what your dad is doing to you is horrible. I get that he's never gotten over Molly's death, but he needs to see you as your own person, and not an extension of Molly . \n\nIt's perfectly normal for you not to have feelings for a person you never met, who died long before you were even born. I wish I could give you a hug \ud83e\udec2", "NTA. I'm petty, I would start collecting medical pamphlets about dementia for him.", "Insist on getting family therapy so you can bring this up in a productive environment.", "Not to mention, wtf is wrong with the stepmom to call a 15 year old a b\\*\\*\\*h?", "Yes OP is not at fault for tempers running high in this home. I hope she finds some peace and her father as well. NTA", "ive asked him before but he started crying and i felt bad so i havent brought it up again, i just know shes dead and thats it. my mom is really nice she just had a drug relapse and so i live with my dad but i go to her house every other weekend and we talk alot. molly is her birth mother too so im scared if i bring her up she might cry too or get upset like my dad", "There is none, at least none that I've found. The world carries on though, regardless of your personal feelings. It's natural to grieve, it's understandable to take some time away from the rest of the world to process. But when your child is depending on you to be present and functional, you suck it up and deal. You figure out a way to move forward, because that is the obligation you committed to when you took responsibility for another life.", ">family therapy\n\nWithout the step-mother\n\nNTA OP but yeah, if he refuses to talk or go to therapy you'll just need to find your own family  on your own and let him go. \\*hugs\\*", "Yeah, stepmom is the worst.", "Yup I did the math in another comment. 24 years to get more help or figure out how to make his living daughter feel like a priority and he hasn't.", "Can you at least talk to her about your situation?  What about grandparents?  This is obviously hurting you and if nothing else tell your dad you want therapy it will give you a voice. After all this time I do not think it will get better. You deserve a life of your own and if he refuses to be a part of your life then find a safe place because this is not. And what is with stepmom?  You do not deserve that. Maybe you can talk to a school counselor and they can refer you to a therapist", "Ask him if he\u2019ll go to family therapy with you.", "He'll get over being upset that OP yelled at him", "If this is real - and it's actually starting to sound like someone trawling for plot ideas - ask your mom, or your grandparents.\n\nOr, heck, look up your sister's death certificate to see if that gives any clues.", "im scared if i tell any of my guidance counselors theyll tell him or think im being abused and i'll get taken away", "lmao my friends have told me my life is one of those shitty middle aged mom movies so i get where youre coming from. shes never been like super openly depressed about molly around me so she might be ok talking about it so i guess its worth a shot", "Nothing has happened that will cause CPS to remove you from the home. You aren't physically in danger, yes there's emotional issues but not ones that would immediately jump to removal. That's not something you have to worry about, you should talk to your favorite teacher or your guidance counselor.", "That won\u2019t happen unless there\u2019s physical abuse going on. You should ask your guidance counsellor what their rules of confidentiality are before talking to them. They have to report if you are in danger or a danger to others but nothing in your post suggests that is the case.", "Op my family was investigated by CPS when I was just a little younger than you are now. I can tell you from personal experience that unless there is severe physical neglect or abuse it is very, very unlikely they would remove you.  I understand your fear, I was terrified, but because there was no serious physical abuse or neglect on the surface CPS just closed their investigation and moved on.\n\nIf you are afraid to talk to your counselor about your dad's actions then I recommend you talk to them about planning for college or trade school.  Tell them it is likely you may need loans or scholarships and ask them what kind of activities might help ear scholarships and where you can apply to.", "No that won\u2019t happen the only thing they can do is get you counseling."]}
