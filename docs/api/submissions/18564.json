Graduations are formal ceremonies, so there\u2019s an expectation of proper behavior, and the teachers are there to ensure the whole event functions in an orderly fashion without disruption. Regardless of whether your son disagreed with the teacher who was upset about the younger brother walking, speaking to the teacher with that condescending attitude is just uncalled for and horrible lack of manners.

Brandon's was seated in front of us and I told Grant to go give him his presents. He went over there and my son's class was just showering him with attention.\n\nThe ceremony begun and Grant was just sitting on Brandon's lap. I thought about going over there but if Grant was being trouble then Brandon would tell him to go back to us. They called my son's name and he walked the stage with Grant. It was a lot of fun for them.\n\nAfter the ceremony, a teacher came to Brandon and told him he shouldn't had let his brother on the stage. It's a privilege for graduating seniors only. My son told her that she was \"dismissed\" and turned his back on her. He didn't really know her. I thought she was out of line so I laughed at her.\n\nShe walked away. I got an email from the VP who told me that my son humiliated a staff and wasn't welcomed back on campus unless he apologized. He didn't see much of a problem with my son walking the stage with my other son just his attitude. I said he's not apologizing and what good is banning him from campus?

They'd basically have to stop to escort this kid back, interrupting a lot of people.", "Classic \"AITA\" post where OP argues with everyone saying yes, they are TA.", "Yes they did - they spoke to him after he broke the rules - your entire story is such", "That happening from the audience is completely different from happening front and center on stage. A child crying off to the side is not even remotely comparable to this kid being in the middle of the stage with his brother and throwing a tantrum.\n\nAnd, again, since you clearly didn't understand it the first time, it's the principle of it: the world does not revolve around this pair of brothers that want to do whatever they want. It was fortunate that it went well, but it was still disrespectful as fuck both to do it and to act like he did when he got called out", "If a kid acts out in the audience, the parents have to deal with it. If a kid acts out on the stage, everyone has to deal with it.", "So if he cares about his brother, that gives him license to be rude to a teacher? If he wanted to defend his brother\u2019s actions he could have just said something like \u2018It\u2019s ok, I didn\u2019t mind\u2019. That\u2019s all.", "No. It's not a slippery slope argument at all. It's just fact. You can't allow one person to do this unless you allow all. Just because In OPs situation the kid didn't cause any problems on stage doesn't mean if you allow all it won't cause problems. Your comment seems somewhat immature and lacking the critical thinking to see the bigger picture. Yes, it's great that this guy loves his brother and wants to bring him on stage but no unfortunately that sets a bad precedent that they can't allow. Teacher handled it right by not making a scene and bringing it up after and OPs son acted like an absolute entitled asshole spoiled brat in his response. You need to grow up if you honestly think that's ok.", "Yea it is. It\u2019s the word for when people of the serving class tried to act higher than their lowly stations.", "They said it, not me.  You don't see that stuff paraded around and bragged about in upper class schools.  People have decorum.  That's why they are upper class.", "Don't be so trashy.  Behave in public.  No one wants to see your brats interrupting a ceremony that is honoring people who actually did something with themselves.", "He\u2019s a senior in high school. You gotta spell out all the rules lol. Now the parents on the other hand should have definitely known better and the older son should have in no way talked to the teacher like he was royalty and she was some peasant. I say the teacher is also an AH because the school didn\u2019t seem to care afterward so why did she need to make a big deal out of it. It was the senior and teachers interaction that caused the issue.", "Let's be honest, they probably do.", "His dad handed the younger brother off to the older brother, the older brother at that point likely thought it was fine, and from what it sounds like, nobody took him aside during it to tell him to send the younger brother back to the parents \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f if staff actually gave a shit, they should\u2019ve said something in the moment, not AFTER the fact.", "That's not the same thing.  The analogy would be if you did a magic trick while you were walking during your own graduation.  Which as a fan of stage magic, I would either feel awed or disappointed based on the execution.", "I see, I missed some of that wording. Imo, not addressing it equates to it not being a big deal, but I can change to ESH. I'm still of the opinion that the teacher chose to confront the teen without being the one in charge of the event or instructed to do so by those who are.", "Yep, teachers do the bulk of organizing graduations. Sometimes we get help from a parenting organization. We are also on duty during the event to keep it running smoothly and efficiently, which is an extremely hard and stressful task. The Principal, VP, and usually the Superintendent or Head of the School Board are on stage handing out diplomas and awards. The hardest thing is, this is like throwing a wedding with a few hundred brides. Each family wants their \u201cbride\u201d to be the star of the show. And each one should be for that moment. That can\u2019t happen if entitled folks decide to be extra. Slows everything down, steals another student\u2019s moment, and can screw up the official stuff with the confusion.", "Because of disrespecting the teacher. It stated the VP had no issue with the brother walking with him.", "Yes of course. But who cares? Again, who got hurt by the brother getting brought on stage.", "This.", "What rule?", "Yeah well tell me exactly in the rule book where it says my 5 year old can\u2019t run around and steal other peoples food at a restaurant??? I\u2019ll wait\u2026 that\u2019s right it\u2019s not in the rule book!", "She chose the least disruptive action while still not letting it slide.  That was the correct move.", "It is interesting in our culture how people find pointing out someones bad behavior to be more of an issue than the bad behavior... \n\nPointless or not. Whether or not the \"school\" cared or not (id argue the teacher is representing the \"school\" here). The kid behaved badly.\n\nIts good to let him know.. he is about to be an adult. He needs to figure this stuff out.", "OP states VP had no problem. Doesn\u2019t make it true. My 30 years of teaching experience & reading OP\u2019s comments tells me that there\u2019s very little chance he\u2019s telling the truth. Either VP just picked his battles & will be sure to address siblings walking sternly before the next grad ceremony or OP is just so entitled they can\u2019t be convinced that anyone disagrees with them.", "Every student and family member who wanted to do something against the rules but didn't, basically.  If everyone did whatever they wanted the event would have been an awful shit show...just because only one family lacked the social grace to understand doesn't make it ok.", "I guarantee you that your son was given a talk about proper conduct at graduation. Dress, where to sit, what items you can/can\u2019t have with you, etc. Expectations are made very clear to avoid disruptions.\n\nThere may not have been a specific \u201cno siblings sitting in your lap and walking the stage with you\u201d rule, but they were probably pretty specific about which seats were for grads only. They may even have had signs up to prevent guests from attempting to take those seats.\n\nDon\u2019t be obtuse.", "the one the teacher was upset with you for violating.  the one that no one else broke.", "Did they call Brandon to the stage or Brandon and Grant? Or Brandon and friends?", "Honest question. Are you feigning this level of stupidity or is this behavior natural for you?", "That\u2019s the perfect way to put it.", "A classic prank at my (any many other) high-school was to hand the principal something random as they shook his hand. Again, why so bothered by casual fun/hijinks?", "You Americans are super weird.\nIn Europe it's accepted to have your kids (life just happens sometimes) or little siblings with you to receive your grades and certificate. It really isn't a big deal, but fun to see how many people in the USA are getting their knickers in a twist over 'respect and rules from the youth'. Please say that again slowly while talking about traffic, gentrification, xenophobia, inclusion, and so on... It's just so sought after because you guys seem to get off to the thought of your offspring being your little robotmaids. It's so disgusting.", "that shit is fucking stupid too, and an insult to everyone who takes this stuff seriously.", "Because they tend to create problems in the long run. Yeah, it's a cute one off, but it's not so cute next year, when a bunch of people want to have someone else walk with them and get upset when they're told no. The kid was wrong, and should have just quickly apologized for not following the rules.", "Guarantee nobody is thinking this. You took a story about a clearly self centered individual and turned it into america sucks lmao", "You are a weirdo. Stop riding americas dick why do you care so much about us?", "Y'all need to live a little", "Y'all need to go do your living somewhere that isn't a formal rehearsed event with obvious rules set for obvious reasons \n\nIf you don't want to follow the rules you are not forced to attend you are allowed to celebrate however you want on your own time at your own place"]}
