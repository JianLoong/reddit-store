I got an email from the VP who told me that my son humiliated a staff and wasn't welcomed back on campus unless he apologized.

He's not coming back to graduate again.", "That\u2019s a school wide email to parents reminding them of the rules. Not one lone teacher seeking him out to reprimand him after the fact. \n\n However, when I graduated HS one of the students one of the students held her baby the entire ceremony.   She didn\u2019t have anyone to babysit so if she couldn\u2019t hold her baby she wouldn\u2019t have been able to walk.  She didn\u2019t ask permission and no one said anything to her.", "Couldn't the staff just tell the future graduates not to do that along with giving the other rules (i.e. be on time, bring cap and gown, etc.)?", "He didn\u2019t even know this teacher and as I said any teacher that did know him will know how he acted in their class.  My wife is a teacher and I can tell you right now she would very likely despise this other teacher, based on the single interaction I know of.  If you are teacher and you basically view your job as \u201cthe boss of children\u201d you are a terrible teacher.", "It's like no one on reddit remembers how petty and assholeish teacher can be in highschool", "That an also graduation from HS doesn't really matter it's not the same as graduating university or something like that if the dude wants to have a cute moment with his lil bro then who gives a shit", "He\u2019s got three siblings?"]}
