Not sister in law \ud83d\ude02", "Son in law.", "With OP\u2019s mom showing up at the school throwing a fit in front of everyone, it won\u2019t be long before everyone figures it out on their own.", "Is it not the start of the school year right now?\n\nGet your kid moved now.  Don't go a whole year like this.", "OP openly admitted that she doesn\u2019t want the girl at the party because of who her parents are. \n\n\u201cDid that woman really want to drop her kid off at OPs house or come in and play grandma\u201d \n\nFunny enough it\u2019s not up to either parent about who their kids are or are not friends with. The parents don\u2019t have to get along at all. But kids have a right to be friends with who they choose. \n\nBut all this is moot anyway since they aren\u2019t friends. Remember OP was going to invite her until she realised who the girl was. Hypothetically if the girls parents did leave an email what then? I just don\u2019t get why OP would originally try to invite kids who her daughter weren\u2019t even friends with.", "No she never apologized. Lol. She said many times that \u201cthe heart wants what the heart wants.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen the Gilmore Girls. But it was very similar to that. She always felt like my friend and like she was rooting for me. Growing up I wanted to be a professional ice skater, and she worked her butt off to pay for private lessons etc. however she would throw temper tantrums and did blame me for things like her being lonely etc. My dad died in a DWI accident when I was 6. She sometimes would claim that he was drinking so much because of the stress of having a child. \n\nNo, she never seemed jealous.", "I have. Several times. My state doesn\u2019t do a great job at child support enforcement.", "They eventually will garnish checks keep going I know you don\u2019t need it but he should not just get off the hook", ">Now about half of the parents opted out of having their contact information on the sheet, including my mother and my ex. So we invited the 6 girls from my daughters class who\u2019s parents had shared their email to the party.\n\nNo she was never going to invite the kid in question. The mother and ex didn't share their email details on the class list. OP just recognised the names", "OP was never going to invite her she thought since their info wasn't on the list it wouldn't be a big deal bc only people on the list got invited. This isn't a difficult concept you're just being willfully obtuse about this. And if they were on the list why exactly should she have invited this child?? Idgaf who her parents are why are you acting like she should invite someone who bullied OP's child to the party? Nobody is punishing her bc of her parents. OP is allowed to feel how she feels and aside from the parentage issue that kid is still a bully. She doesn't deserve an invite.", "You can see it Like this. Would you be find to put your Kid in toxic waste? Just because there another Kid there? No you wouldn't and OP already mentioned, that her daughter and the daughter of waste are neither Friends nor friendly classmates. The other Girl even bullied OPs daughter", "The heart wants what the heart wants, and the heart wants cruel people to stay away", "May I suggest you getting a process server and then contact \u201cmom\u201d and say you\u2019ll meet with both of them at X place and get him served that way. Your kid deserves to have the safety net of his child support payments for her future needs- ex college, travel, down payment for a house etc", "Keep trying!! That dead beat cheater needs to pay up for his kids. Even if you dont need his money, this is money is YOUR children\u2019s money that they are entitled to and can put in their college funds etc. Dont let him get away with anymore!", "Oh \ud83d\ude25 ok", "I don't understand these states that \"don't do a great job.\" I live in Pennsylvania. I'm in the mountains in a VERY poor county with little to no service for its residence. Years ago, after paying off my son's braces, I messed up. My support was actually lowered upon paying off the braces, but I, new to wearing reading glasses read the new total as $xxx.00 instead of $xxx.09. THEY LITERALLY SENT OUT A SHERIFF TO ARREST ME OVER $0.09! It was explained to me that were an all our nothing state and 9 cents was the same as hundreds of dollars. Say overnight in jail.", "No I'm sorry its not silly, you basically live in the same school district.\n\nWhat will happen when your children find out about this situation, how do you think they will feel ?  \nDo you think they would still want to live near them ?    \n\nHow painful will it be for them when they find out there father was so near and he didn't want any contact with them ?   \n\nYour daughter will find out soon, they are growing up, someone will tell her.   \n\nMay be its time you did tell her and get her therapy because she will need it.", "I hadn't seen OP's edits before my response. That's the issue with replying to topics in \"new\". From the initial text I understood the daughter had chosen who to invite to her birthday party. Now I'm even more confused. OP doesn't want kids of parents she doesn't like there, but was OK with potentially having kids her daughter didn't even like? Because if the situation was exactly the same but the kid wasn't the half-sister she would have invited her daughter's bully to a sleepover at her house for her daughter's party.\n\nThis makes her an even bigger AH.", "Oh okay. Thanks for this extreme life changing advice total stranger on the internet who doesn\u2019t know my whole life, and also doesn\u2019t know whether my children are already in therapy. :)", "It is silly.  Did you read #6?   OP, you\u2019re good.", "So again, you're punishing the kid because you don't like their parents. That makes you an AH in my eyes.", "How old are you"]}
