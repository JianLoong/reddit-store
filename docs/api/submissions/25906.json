When I was 22, my ex-husband filed for divorce from me because he was having an affair with my mother and had gotten her pregnant. At the time, I was also pregnant and we had a 3 year old. My ex husband said that because my mother was older than me (she was 36 or 37 at the time) she needed his support more than I did. Two years later I went no contact with both of them. \n\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago. My daughter is now in the 4th grade and she asked if she could have a sleepover party for her birthday / back to school party. I told her of course and that we could send invites to her class using the class roster / contact sheet the teacher had emailed the parents. \n\n\nWhen I was going through the list I unfortunately noticed that my mother and ex husband are listed as parents of a little girl in my daughters class. Now about half of the parents opted out of having their contact information on the sheet, including my mother and my ex. So we invited the 6 girls from my daughters class who\u2019s parents had shared their email to the party. \n\nMy mother found out about the party and has been livid ever since trying so many toxic ways to contact me and get her daughter invited to the party. I don\u2019t want her daughter at the party, mostly because the whole situation is very painful to me and brings up bad emotions and I don\u2019t want to have a relationship with the kid. \n\nSo at pickup yesterday my mom made a scene in front of the other parents and called me an asshole for excluding her daughter, who is very sad about not being invited. \n\nReddit, AITA for being firm on not inviting her daughter? I feel bad about it but my daughter doesn\u2019t get along with her to begin with.\n\nEdit: 1) My daughter is not friends with this girl at all and didn\u2019t want to invite her to the party. Last year they were in different classes and my daughter was kind of picked on by the other girl. \n\n2) no my daughter doesn\u2019t know that this is her sister / her aunt.

Answer her: If she approaches you again, you will make the reason why her daughter is not invited public knowledge.\n\nShe is your mom and cheated with your then husband, and this is the resulting kid. That IS quite a story, and a good reason to avoid contact.", "NTA at all. Jeez your mother and ex are disgusting!!!!", "My daughter is aware that they are related. We had this talk last year when the other child was enrolled at her school and the two of them were not getting along. The other child is kind of a bully in my\nopinion. \n\nI didn\u2019t give my daughter the full details of what happened.

My mother was a freshman in high school when I was born. \n\nI got pregnant at 19 and got married to my ex as a result, and had my son. When I was 22, I got pregnant with my daughter.

I think I was about 6 months pregnant when they found out or at least told me my mother was pregnant.", "My mother is pretty bad. \n\nSometimes I feel sorry for my ex, because now that I\u2019m older I see how much she manipulated him and how young he really was at the time.", "God damn so when he said she would need some support he meant all the support\n\nI can't stand people that just abandon their child in that manner, okay the family dynamics might be frosty but that's still his kid and he should be paying his way", "It's totally normal to feel embarrassed and to not want this to get out. I would be as well. Try and be kind to yourself if you can. You had no control in this situation and it isn't your fault.\n\n If you do not want to get the school involved, speak to a lawyer and you can have a cease and desist letter sent to your mother. In that letter, your lawyer can threaten a restraining order upon further contact. \n\nEmbarrassment aside, you need to get this type of antisocial behaviour on record since your mother has access to your daughter. You don't know how long before she turns on her as well.", "Make sure they are in different classes from now on.", "No I saw it but if her daughter doesn\u2019t even like her why think about inviting her in the first place.

I have a half-sister that is a result from my dad cheating on my mom. I love her to death, she isn't to blame about any of it. And clearly the kid doesn't understand what is happening and is suffering because of that. You don't have to welcome her into your family nor invite her parents into your home, but you should let your child invite whomever she wants to her birthday party as you told her you would. Sorry, but in this case I need to go with YTA.", "Yeah. Im sure that this is probably also how he learned when her birthday is to be honest with you. He never showed any interest in her.", "Believe me. I will. Lol.", "Call me crazy, but I wouldn\u2019t leave my child in a home for an overnight stay if I, myself wasn\u2019t welcome in that home. But my mother was never mother of the year to begin with. Lol. \n\nI am not \u201cblaming\u201d the child for their parents crimes. It makes me uncomfortable to have a relationship with the child or my mother/ ex. \n\nYour situation is very different than mine. It\u2019s not as if my ex husband had an affair with some random person, my husband had an affair with my MOTHER. My primary attachment figure. As a mother myself now, I could never imagine doing anything to hurt my child, and it\u2019s particularly sick to me that she took a sexual interest her own daughter\u2019s husband. \n\nThere are layers of abuse here that I think you\u2019re missing. \n\nI\u2019m not arguing with your judgement. I just think you\u2019re comparing apples to oranges here.", "If he is not that interested in her, why don't you take the kid and move far far away from them? Now your daughter is young and does not understand the situation but in the long run she will be affected by this messed up crap. Imagine being a young woman and realising that your dad cheated on your mother with your grandma and he was more interested in that child. Or having a half sister that is your aunt in the same time...", "Not saying the situations are similar. Just gave an example of a situation where many people would hate on their siblings. The kid is not to blame. I'm not even pretend to understand what you went through in that situation it's completely bollocks.\n\nThe fact that you wouldn't be OK with your kid going, it doesn't have to be the same to others. I don't have a kid yet, but I honestly don't know if I'll have such a problem as I'm not the one being invited to that home. Nevertheless that's something for her parents to decide, not you.", "Because their lives and my life is more than this shitty thing that happened to me. I would be leaving behind:\n\n1) their school, friends, and community. \n2) my established and stable income career \n3) my friends and support system \n4) the home that I own \n5) basically my whole life\n6) a school with excellent special education programs that my 11 year old needs. \n\nNo. That\u2019s really silly.", "I think most involved/ good parents would not leave their child in a home in which they themselves are not welcome in. That\u2019s just smart parenting. It\u2019s not a good idea to leave your kids with anyone who can\u2019t / don\u2019t completely trust. If you can\u2019t go inside someone\u2019s home and see what\u2019s going on or understand the dynamic, you can\u2019t completely trust that person. \n\nWhen you have kids hopefully you\u2019ll understand.", "Maybe, but again, that's not your call.", "You\u2019re right. But it is my call to say, I don\u2019t feel comfortable having a child in my home, who\u2019s parents are not welcome in my home.", "This. The parents are crazy and once they know you are around will absolutely do anything to mess this up. \n\nHonestly I'd tell the teacher that this is an issue and your daughter is not to go near this kids parents."]}
