The parties where parents didn't stay were always like \"drop them off and go have time for yourselves!\" or \"come back and get them at 7pm!\"", "Op doesnt have kids, they arent a parent, they need to be told what they need to do, op was not told to watch the kids, they didnt know they had to, how many of you remember being watched, i remember being at the beach, i dont remember my mom sitting, doing nothing, staring at me like a maniac", "OP said they were babysitting for the weekend. They mention they didn't know of the party and were asked to transport stuff and stay. That is it. From OP's story, they were not told to supervise. They were not given instructions. If you want to talk about common sense, it was the stepmom that failed to give OP the proper details and what was expected.", "Humans were hardier back then so it doesn't count:)", "I wasn\u2019t commenting that it wasn\u2019t appropriate to stay.  Particularly these days. \nI was simply commenting that it is a newer expectation in response to \u201cit is not new.\u201d", "Have you never seen a class room ? A single adult can watch up 25-30 kids at once.", "Maybe it\u2019s a regional thing.  My brother had drop off parties all the time in the 90s, and I was often filling my SUV with kids to carpool them all home afterwards.", "And smoking cigarettes. We can legally risk our lives for \"our country\" at 18 and we're expected to suddenly be capable of caring for ourselves but Lord forbid we smoke or drink. You also can't rent a vehicle in most places until you're 21-25. There's loads of stuff you can't do until then and it's pretty ridiculous.", "No, i think that her proximity to any age group is irrelevant. It would have also been ridiculous to say \u201ca woman in her 20s\u201d \n\nShe is an adult tasked with watching young children.

As others have said 16 year olds can be full life guards. Children can babysit that are a decade younger than her. Assuming she isn\u2019t an idiot, she should and likely does know better.  \nThis wasn\u2019t a \u201cdon\u2019t text your best friends boyfriend all the time\u201d lesson. It\u2019s literally watching kids to make sure they don\u2019t die. \nShe knew.", "Then maybe it's regional? I'm from Eastern Canada.\n\nEdit: Also, it wasn't communicated that you didn't have to stay because literally no one stayed. I can't describe how strange it is to me that parents would stay at a kid's birthday, lol.", "OP is the definition of an adult you can make whatever justification you like if the kids got hurt or died who would feel responsible?", "Studies show that this kind of helicopter parenting is really hurting kids too. Back in the 90's we were walking to school, alone from 2nd grade on. It was about a mile walk. Now parents literally stand with their middle school kids at the corner waiting for the bus. Kids are worse at decision making, have more stress and anxiety, and are performing worse at school.\n\nBut then at 18 they are magically supposed to turn into adults who can pay rent and understand credit. Right.", "Parents stayed at my parties in the 90s.\nDropping off and leaving is newer to me, and when my kids are invited I always assume I\u2019ll be staying too unless told otherwise at the door.", "This is a weird take.\nI always assume I\u2019ll be staying because that\u2019s what we did in the 90s.\nIt\u2019s not to hover over the kids unless they actually need supervision, but to converse with the adults, have some nibbles etc.\n\nMy kid had a birthday at a trampoline place, all but 1 parent stayed, I didn\u2019t even ask them. We had a good time sat at the tables talking.", "If you think the age is irrelevant, then I can respect that.", "Was i told its my job to watch them, if not id blame their parent, the one that dropped them off a ditched, the one that asked my to drop off boards not watch kids", "I live five houses down from the elementary school. I walked alone to my school as a kid, much further away.\n\nThe school will not allow them to leave the property alone. If a designated parent isn't there for pick up, the kids are brought back into the school and they start calling us. \n\nIt's for safety but I think it's silly they wouldn't let them walk if the parents sign off on it and take responsibility for anything that could happen.", "I have mixed feelings on this topic.\n\nRecently, I took my son to a concert.  I went to see that same band for my first unsupervised concert when I was just a year older than he is now.  \n\nThere is no way in hell I\u2019d let him attend a concert like that alone.  Is he responsible enough?  Probably.  It\u2019s the other people I find concerning.  Adults.  People are far crazier now, and young people tend to attract it.", "I'm far from a helicopter parent, let my third grader walk himself to school, etc. But no way in hell would I let him go to a party at a lake and not only not supervise him, but not even check that another adult is doing so. There's allowing kids to learn independence and then there's negligence.", "\"I babysat my siblings for the weekend\"\n\n\"I was expected to stay there the entire time, even though I cant drive them back\"\n\n\"I went to my car but could still see the lake\"\n\nWhy are you people feigning ignorance for her. For starters, the post ***literally says she knows she was expected to stay and watch them. Its why she mentioned having a view of the lake from her car***. She knew what was expected of her, and made an irresponsible decision. She also didnt even let the other parents who would, in your mind, be assumed to be watching over the kids know where she would be. Nothing happened, so its not the end of the world, and being an AH here isnt some kind of permanent stamp on her as a person but it doesnt mean she shouldnt be called out for it and adjust her decisions in the future.\n\nThe stepmother is of course also an asshole here, but thats irrelevant once she is in the position of caring for her siblings. There seems to be zero concern from both her defenders and herself actually looking out for her siblings in a responsible way (inform other parents on where youre going, contact SM to tell her she isnt willing willing to look over them the entire time, ***anything*** other than just disappearing without notice to her car) and instead just shifting blame to the SM and making assumptions that the other people would just look over them.\n\nAt the end of the day, she ended up being in the position to look over them. It doesnt matter if thats a shitty or unfair situation to her, it is the reality of the situation. She handled it irresponsibly, can learn from it, and move on.", "You are not wrong the mom made a bad decision but would OP feel like an AH if something had happened? There there is your answer. Part of being an adult is taking  responsibility when you realize you need should. Making excuses is child behavior.

There's a lot of odd details in this that make it seem fake.", "If you were babysitting your siblings and were expected to be there as the \"responsible adult\" for your siblings (i.e. \"expected to be there for the entire party\"), then Yes, YTA. It was irresponsible to let them out of your sight for longer than it takes to go to the bathroom (or drop the paddleboards) - and even then, you need to make contact with another adult to let them know where you are going and ask if they will keep an eye on the kids until you return. It didn't matter that you could \"see the lake,\" you needed to be close enough to effect immediate intervention in any situation involving your charges.", "Honestly the whole situation sucks, your mom should have been clearer on what was expected of you. While to people with kids know just how dangerous kids being in a lake can be even at ages 8+even being decent swimmers get caught unaware in lakes.

Thus the word \"Unbeknownst\". Plus over the weekend can 100% mean \"after this event\" or \"before this event\". And all of that should be communicated in advance.

I get that things are different where you\u2019re from, I'm trying to explain that your perspective is not universal.\n\nAlso, my parents didn't just punt me from the car, they went to the door with me to drop me off. If everyone else's parents had stayed, they would have too. It just wasn't done. \n\nBy \"it was assumed,\" I mean that on all fronts. The hosts also assumed that parents wouldn't be staying.

Literally right above that is where she says she didn't know the kids were going to this party and that she was expected to stay with them.

You are literally proving my point that stepmum did not inform OP of this beforehand and that she is a shitty person for dumping her kids without prior notice. \n\nHonestly it seems like you don't even know what you're saying.

Period. \n\nAnd as far as assuming someone can stay, I never said anything about that. So I\u2019m not sure why you are acting like I did. I think automatically assuming either way is an asshole move. \n\nBut I\u2019m genuinely surprised that the parents wouldn\u2019t want more people around if it was a more \u201cdangerous\u201d activity such as involving water. That\u2019s crazy to me personally because anything can happen so fast and I absolutely want as many people around watching the kids as possible.", "I mean, I walked to school back then. I remember being catcalled at 11. And I absolutely looked like an 11 year old. I don't want my kids to experience what I experienced.", "Honest question: Why do you insist my parents were assholes even after I clarified that they didn\u2019t \"drop and run\" as you put it, but brought me to the door and greeted the host parents before dropping me off? I even said that they would have stayed if that had been expected of them, it just wasn't.\n\n>but I do not agree that anything should have just been assumed.\n\nWhy though? I think we have different interpretations of the word \"assume\". The way I see it, everyone makes assumptions based on previous experience. For example, in North America, it is often considered rude to wear a hat indoors. But if someone comes from a culture where wearing hats indoors is fine, they will assume wearing a hat indoors is fine. Someone might find the fact that they're wearing a hat rude and ask \"Why would you assume you could wear a hat inside?\" But why wouldn't they assume that? It's all they'd ever known. Likewise, leaving your kids at a birthday party is what EVERYONE did when I was a kid. Why *wouldn't* a parent assume they could leave?\n\nYou're an asshole if you stick by your assumption even after being told you're wrong, but you can't expect people to just inherently understand social etiquette they have never been confronted with before. \n\n>And as far as assuming someone can stay, I never said anything about that.\n\nI know you didn't, and I wasn't saying that you were. I'm sorry that wasn't clear. I was working off of the interpretation of \"assuming\" I outlined above, and was trying to explain that both the host and the guest parent are making assumptions when they plan, and that they can go either way.\n\nAre you saying that the host parent should specify what is expected on the invitation? If so, I think that's reasonable, but I do think that you're missing something if you say that a parent is wrong to \"make assumptions.\" Social etiquette is basically all assumptions about how people behave. For example, some people think if you should always arrive at least an hour late to an \"adult\" party, but not everyone knows that, so you can't get mad at someone for assuming they should arrive at they scheduled start time, likewise you can\u2019t get mad at a host for assuming the party will start late.\n\nI just think that we should all give people a little grace, and not fault them for making reasonable assumptions based on past experience. And again, my parents greeted the host parents before leaving, and it was always clear that the assumption on both sides was that parents would leave. My parents never ditched me without greeting the hosts first. I genuinely don't know what more you expected them to do. The expectation wasn't communicated in advance for the same reason we don't write \"wearing hats indoors is rude\" on all entryways. It's \"assumed\" everyone already knows that.\n\nIf I've mischaracterized your argument, I'm sorry. Please let me know, and I'll try to respond as best I can. Also:\n\n>But I\u2019m genuinely surprised that the parents wouldn\u2019t want more people around if it was a more \u201cdangerous\u201d activity such as involving water.\n\nWhat can I say? We obviously had very different childhoods \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
