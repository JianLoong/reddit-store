What did you think you were there for?)", "You state you \u201cbabysat your siblings this weekend\u201d, meaning you were supposed to be watching them at the the birthday party and were not invited there to meet people your age?! YTA for letting them out of your sight.", "Even if you could see the lake from your car, you were scrolling your phone so you wouldn\u2019t have seen the kids get into danger. So gentle YTA. \n\n\u201cGentle\u201d because it seems that when you agreed to babysit, the 5 hour lake party was unbeknownst to you. It should have been made clear to you up front so you could decide whether to babysit or not. I personally would never have agreed to watch someone else\u2019s kids at a lake but you weren\u2019t given the opportunity to say no. \n\nBut when all is said and done, since you found yourself in a position of responsibility for the kids, you should not have been in your car.", "you were put in an unfair situation, but it was not the right time to rebel. Always watch kids near water. Always.", "YTA. If anything had happened to the kids while you were supposed to be babysitting them and you were in the car, would you have been able to get to them in time? \n\nYou need to talk with your stepmum to avoid future situations like that but in the moment your first responsibility was to care for your siblings and you didn't do that, you sat in a car, playing on your phone for long enough that other moms thought you were missing (most likely cause your siblings were looking for you).", "YTA.\n\nYou were supposed to be babysitting them, which means you're responsible for them even at a party.\n\nI get it, you misunderstood, it happens.

That is so dangerous!!", "Unfortunately, events at a lake do require parents to stay and supervise.  Sorry.\n\nHer angry reaction was partly fear.  Don\u2019t take it to heart.  Life is a learning experience .\n\nGentle YTA", "Slight YTA.  It kind of sounds like stepmom played you a bit.  I\u2019m trying to imagine saying yes to watching kids you can\u2019t really interact with on a lake for 5 hours.  But yeah you gotta watch them by water.  My god though 5 hours and I\u2019d be thinking about calling the police.", "YTA Lakes are fucking dangerous for children and you were their guardian. Wtf were you thinking?", "YTA. Although those kids are not yours, you took them to the party. If you're taking a CHILD to a party, you're responsible for them the entire time. ANYTHING could of happened, what would you have done if they went missing, drowned or got severely injured and you had no idea because you were BORED. What was you thinking when you decided to leave them alone?!\n\nEDIT : Youre 21?! Act like a damn adult, I thought you were 17 with your lack of judgement! You said \"I pray she doesnt tell my stepmum\" Yeah because you know what you did was wrong.", "YTA. You should have put them in someone else's care explicitly or returned home with all of them if you weren't willing to watch them. As people have said, lakes and water are extremely dangerous and the safety of your siblings should have been your first thought as their caretaker. Babysitting means you are responsible for them. You are an adult and you should be grateful no one drowned as a result of your negligence.", "YTA", "Ummm, why would you agree to this?  The mothers can watch the kids.

Leaving children unattended at a party AT A LAKE? Honestly you\u2019re a grown adult and couldn\u2019t comprehend that it wouldn\u2019t be ok?", "NTA , Everyone is assuming you know how to swim . Everyone is assuming you should have just known your duty . Sorry folks not every young adult has the right way an answer in every new situation.

Unless you were being paid to babysit!", "NTA.", "NTA fuck them kids lol", "YTA and extremely irresponsible. You left your 3 young siblings to play in the water without proper supervision.

Did she just drive the kids there and then turn around and leave?", "Honestly I thought my stepmum just wanted me as an extra pair of hands to transport the paddle boards and mingle with people. There was no run-down from her, but maybe I should\u2019ve figured it out on my own.", "I, too, would like to know why OP thought she was there for. \n\nYou can't drive the kids home but needed to stay there. You needed to stay there to supervise. Of course you were an asshole for not supervising. It wasn't even like you accidentally got distracted for a few minutes by something else going on. You actually removed yourself from the gathering. You aren't \"first point of contact.\" You are first line of defense to prevent drowning.", "this might be the most on-the-verge ESH i\u2019ve ever been, gentle YTA is like one degree above that i think. we need to draw a spectrum!", "OP didn't take them to the party and isn't allowed to transport children. That was their actual parent's job, as was telling OP they were responsible for the children in the water.", "No. The important thing is that she agreed to babysit. Of course it's her responsibility then. I don't see why not receiving money should make it ok to neglect the kids after you agreed to watching them", "I was with you until the unnecessary insult", "Does she do this often? Assume that you are available for whatever task she decides is your job?\n\nI know this situation sucked but sitting in the car was the wrong move. You put your siblings at risk, even if you could see them, how long would it have taken you to rescue one of them from the water?\n\nThe real problem here is that you are not setting boundaries with your time and how you deserve proper notification about family events and expectations. Do you rely on your stepmom for anything? Do you live at home? \n\nIt shouldn't be up to you to \"figure it out on your own\". Your stepmom should have properly and clearly communicated her expectations to you *and you should have the opportunity to decline*.\n\nA good therapist can help you work on standing up for your needs and setting healthy boundaries for yourself. \n\nBe kind to yourself. I'm sending you the biggest hug.", "You\u2019re an adult. Yes you should have common sense to not leave children unattended by you at the lake. Come on."]}
