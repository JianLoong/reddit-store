You are not her therapist - if she does not have one. She needs one.", "NTA\n\nWhy was your dad never interested in having sex with his wife?  Is/was there a medical reason or was he just not interested?  If it's the latter, then they should have divorced years ago as it's not unnatural for both males and females to express their sexual desires.  The fact that your mother acted on those desires is not unreasonable if your father refused to satisfy her needs.   \n\nThe issue of your mother keeping you very much abreast of her sexual antics is a very different matter, and should not have happened!  Now, she is facing the loss of her sexual companion and as much as you hate the situation, ask yourself, if it was wrong to find the sexual fulfillment that your father refused to provide?  Clearly, she had an emotional as well sexual attachment to the person so her grief is totally natural.  I understand that it's difficult for you to support your mum, but has your father ever explained his lack of sexual interest in her.  Perhaps if he did, your opinion of your mother may change.  Just maybe, dad isn't as \"saintly as you might imagine.  For example, was he getting it on the side/have a mistress, or maybe, he was actually gay and had a male friend!  Just exploring!!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"a few years ago, she kept complaining to me about how she wanted sex but my dad wasn't interested. so she would look elsewhere for that need.\" .. what an abusive AH your mom is to push that on her kid.", "NTA - Such details are something that needs to be kept for oneself, especially when children are involved. Your mom had no right in confiding in you like that. I can only imagine how humiliating that felt. Plus i really don't understand what she expected from you..I would be stone cold too.", "thank you. I have been telling her this and she just says \"I know, I'm a terrible mother\" in a tone that, again, feels like she wants me to disagree and give her pity. but I never do. and she seems upset by that lol", "they don't have an open marriage, as my dad really doesn't like her cheating and I am sure doesn't cheat himself because he spends all his time at work (I would know, we work at his restaurant together and live together).\n\n\nI live in the US, so divorce isn't a big deal, but I think for them it's a matter of \"we've been together 30+ years, if we end it now, what will we do?\" which is why I don't think my dad is fighting back or my mom is trying to cut him off to get her sex needs somewhere else.\n\n\nI have heard of emotional incest before (a med student told me about it after a brief description of my situation once) but I've never heard of \"grey rocking\". I will do some research into this, since everything else you said was insightful, I bet it will be worth my time. thank you.", "he is aware. he doesn't approve but has given up trying to manage her, so we all pretend all like everything is fine", "I do live with them, trying to save money to move out. my dad flat out ignores everything about the affair, so no. i have a brother but she talks to me about it 90% of the time (she has told me so herself). all these years, she came to me about her relationship problems almost exclusively over anyone else.", "I hear that, I hear that. she knows she needs therapy, tho. she knows that about herself, so I don't think my telling her will help at all. in fact, I have said it, tho not as elaborately as you said- probably something along the lines of \"if you have no one else to tell, try getting a therapist\". I will bring it up next time, tho, since, to be fair, she has many legitimate reasons to be depressed than just this.", "Just like you see the value in victim blaming op", "That's super manipulative and making it about her again. My MIL does this. It's like anything shared about how it might hurt you and your feelings gets turned around and is like \"omg I tried my best. I'm sorry I sucked. Omg you have no idea how much I tried and how hard it was for me\".", "Oof my mom does this, except instead of affairs, it\u2019s shit talking my dad and trying to get me to help her figure out how to \u201chandle him\u201d. (They were broken up before I was born but still co-parented.) Whenever I tell her my therapist and I agreed that this was a boundary that was not healthy for her to cross, it\u2019s always, \u201cWell, what would she say if she knew I had no one else to talk to and it was going to make me wind up in the hospital because of the stress?\u201d and all sorts of things. It really sucks to have a parent be so willing to dump their emotional baggage on your shoulders regardless of how detrimental it is to you.

You are now 19 so not a child anymore but it has gone on and on for years. So you were a minor then. Any parent should never burden their children with these kind of things. Not the part about having relationships with other people outside of marriage. And this is indeed manipulative behavior.", "You sound callous and cold.  And that's precisely what your mother deserves, because she taught you to do this as a survival mechanism to deal with her selfishness.", "What she\u2019s doing is a form of abuse, constantly steamrolling your boundaries. At some point you might have to get mean to get her to stop. \n\nIt is not easy to be in this situation, I know. My mom used to overshare, and when I told friends about it they recommended the book Stop Walking on Eggshells. It\u2019s specifically for dealing with a family member with BPD, but I found it helpful for establishing and maintaining boundaries.", "At this point it might be most effective to become a broken record and say the same thing every time she brings this up. \"Mom, we've talked about this, I am not the right audience for your relationship problems\" and then if possible walk away. Eventually skip to just walking away.", "The important part is not mentioning a therapist. The important part is acknowledging you hear her and recognize she is hurting.", "I don\u2019t see how I did that but whatever - if I did it wasn\u2019t my intention.  As a mom about the same age with a teenage son, I have learned by going therapy to define what it is I want to hear from people, especially my children.  A parent, as a person, needs to hear they are heard,  their pain is acknowledged and a reminder that they have crossed the parent child boundary and made their child uncomfortable. If I\u2019m the AH for trying to help this kid, so be it.  His mom is a piece of work and I feel horrible for this young man.  My own mother was awful.", "omg you could have quoted her exactly- I know being a parent is hard! I can't imagine the difficulty. but like. I cannot imagine I, as a man, having a daughter, and telling her about my affairs when she was a young teenager and then playing the victim, like \ud83d\uddff", ">\u201cWell, what would she say if she knew I had no one else to talk to and it was going to make me wind up in the hospital because of the stress?\u201d and all sorts of things.   \n\n\nNext time she says this, reply, \u201cShe\u2019d tell you to make an appointment.\u201d Then hand your mom her business card.", "lol, I am the family member with bpd, tho I wouldn't be surprised if she has it as well, she has many of the symptoms. \n\nI think she, and my shitty childhood \"friends\", are largely the reason I have bpd. and she probably has it (if she does) from her mother. generational trauma do be... *sigh*", "why? I know she is hurting, but she got herself into this mess. again, if it was an actual friend, not someone who she fucked instead of my dad, I would agree.", "The important part is her acknowledging that what she does is wrong and kind of abusive.", "Sorry you had to experience this and continue to experience this.", "Generational trauma sucks, I concur. Consider getting the book. It might also help you manage your bpd.", "It\u2019s about getting her to leave you alone - it isn\u2019t about actually fixing her situation.

So let me get this right, she was chatting with her then 14 year old son about her sex life? That is horrendously disgusting, bordering on abuse. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing & just don\u2019t engage. If she thinks that it\u2019s mean so what, she\u2019s been harassing you with her sex life since you were 14 she can get over it.", "INFO: Does your dad know your mom is constantly cheating on people? Is the relationship open?", "NTA.\n\nIf you want to \"be the bigger person\" you could say something like, \"I'm sorry you're going through this; I know you're in a lot of pain.  For obvious reasons, though, please don't talk to me about  him or any other affair partner you may have because that's very painful for me to listen to.  Please find someone else to talk to about this.\"  If she listens and stops talking about this, great.  If not, you have a clear conscience because you were sympathetic, approached her in a reasonable way, and she refused to be reasonable in return.", "NTA\n\nLearn to hang up or to walk away.", "You have the ability to shut this down. Tell her. Yes, she is a terrible mother. Maybe if she wasn\u2019t out cheating all the time she would have time to make some friends.

You can\u2019t. And chances are she won\u2019t bc she\u2019s not even trying. She\u2019s trying to fix her life by getting some strange which\u2026 is extremely stupid and doesn\u2019t work. \n\nStart setting boundaries now for how you want to interact with her for the rest of your life. How that looks is entirely up to you.  And don\u2019t feel guilty about it.

Like yeah you were terrible idk why u expect me to disagree lmao", "It honestly sounds like sexual abuse as well, because this isn\u2019t just talking about her relationships. I had a friend whose parent exposed her to pornography when she was a young teen without her consent. When she told her mother she reported it and it was considered sexual abuse. I\u2019m not sure this is much different, if graphic details were shared."]}
