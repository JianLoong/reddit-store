Ever since the beginning his family has just been super invasive and nosy. Backstory of some things they\u2019ve done.. on our wedding day they asked him to come out after our reception to drink more instead of go home with his new wife. They\u2019d call every day, even during dinner time and talk for hours, and encouraged him to take shots with them and get him drunk. When I was pregnant his sister used my ultrasound pictures as her cover photo, and continued to make her cover photo pictures of our child as the baby grew, making it look like her child. They\u2019d call every day requesting to see the baby, and complain about not seeing the baby if we didn\u2019t answer. We visited one year for Christmas and they got upset because after a week of packing up and coming to them, I asked them to come to us. When the refused, I said we are not going over there. They flipped out, and I ended up going to them to make everyone happy but  since then have disliked me and my family. They now act like I\u2019m not even here when my husband mentions my name. They refuse to admit my kids look like me, they always compare them to themselves.  On Mother\u2019s Day, his mom got mad at him because he didn\u2019t visit her due to being sick, and having plans for me. Both his mother and sisters made him feel horrible for it, and not once did they encourage him to spend the day with the mother of his kids (me). \nIt\u2019s to the point where I am extremely hurt by how they treat me, not to mention just have been fed up with how they\u2019ve disrespected our marriage for years now. I feel so excluded and hurt, and to be honest I don\u2019t even want them seeing our now 2 kids, but I also don\u2019t want to ruin my kids relationships.\nWhat I really want is there to be some strict boundaries. My husband has trouble saying no to them and tries to please them simply because he doesn\u2019t want drama. In my eyes the way they treat his wife will directly effect the relationship with our kids and them. He is a wonderful husband and father, but he is afraid to hurt their feelings while mine are constantly being hurt. I\u2019m at a loss of what to do about it, as it\u2019s constantly causing tension in our marriage.

Start there.", "NTA, they sound overly meddlesome and not in a well intentioned way.  Your husband needs to lay down the law with them over this sort of thing.", " NTA I would suggest some marriage counseling asap. \n\nIf your husband is the wonderful (doubtful) husband and father then he needs to realize the damage\nThey are doing to you and your children.\n \nBut honestly if he was so wonderful he would realize.\n\n1- by disrespecting you they are actually disrespecting him. They have so little respect for him they think they can disrespect his wife. And why should they respect him. Most men would not let any one especially his family to disrespect his wife and marriage. \n\n2- if he was a wonderful father he would realize that your children are watching him. If your kids are boys they are learning from him how to treat woman. Right now he is teaching them to disrespect woman. Not to stand up for themselves or thier future partners. \n\nIf you have girls. He is teaching them to just obey the husband that thier feeling do not matter. When it comes to their future in-laws suck it up. Let them walk all over her and her marriage. \n\n3- he is teaching the kids to prioritize everyone but thier spouse and kids. \n\nThis is not the behavior of a good father or role model.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t but your foot down with your husband. \nYour teaching your daughters/sons to let everyone walk all over you. That it\u2019s ok to be disrespected. That others have the right to make you feel less than.\n\nIs this the things you want to teach your children.\n\n\nYou need to stop going to the in-laws. You need to keep your kids away from these toxic and narcissistic people.", "You have a husband problem OP, not an in-laws problem. If he can stand to see you repeatedly hurt because he is appeasing his family at the cost of your emotional well-being, he is not a \"wonderful husband.\" Consider this - your feelings are less important to him than his family's. He needs to prioritize you and the kids and set hard boundaries with his mom and sisters. You're NTA. He and his family are certainly TA.", "You are definitely NTA. If I were you, I would have a conversation with him first, but you\u2019re also going to need to speak with them. They need to know that disrespecting you further will lead o then being cut off from your kids. I mean, these people are mean and rude.", "NTA-if your husband can't talk to them and set boundaries then I would really limit contact with them. Your husband should have your back here and deal with his family.", "NTA. Your husband's family is selfish and behaves rude/weird.", "Part of the issue is they haven\u2019t been disrespectful to my actual face. They do it in other ways, like asking him to go out after our wedding. The only time they\u2019ve gotten disrespectful to me personally was when I said we weren\u2019t going to them on Christmas after going to them all week. The were visually mad at me and have brought it up in the past how I need to apologize for that. Other than that it has been non direct disrespect if that makes sense?", "NTA. He clearly sees the cost of upsetting them. Now he needs to see the cost of upsetting you. Does he think it's important for his kids to see their parents as a team that supports each other, instead of one person who keeps sacrificing herself while the other pays no mind?\n\nLet him know that you're not willing to subject your kids or yourself to his family environment for more than small doses, because of the way they treat people. Let him know that every time he gives in to them, he's turning his back on his wife and kids and making you three bear the burden of him being a pushover. He needs to understand what his actions are costing your family.", "NTA.  Your husband inability to prioritize you/his children is very disrespectful.   This is not how a \"wonderful\" husband acts - he has no problem saying \"no\" to you - but not to them.  Don't you find this odd?  Strongly encourage a marriage counselor/therapist for both of you.  Discussing setting/enforcing boundaries, prioritizing spouse/children would be a good start.  \n\nYour husband is responsible for the drama, hurt and negativity that he's allowed to permeate your family.  Time for him to put his big boy pants and and act like a responsible husband and father.", "NTA.  In your shoes I\u2019d never go there for Christmas again. Your husband can take the kids to visit without you.  You don\u2019t need their bs and your husband can deal with it.  \n\nFrom now on you are busy and have things to do.  Just can\u2019t make it sorry.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He is more concerned with making everyone happy than keeping his wife from being hurt. He needs to realize how his inaction on this is as bad as being fully on their side.", "It seems like he's being a wonderful son and brother, but not a wonderful husband. He's putting their happiness above yours.", "He\u2019s not wonderful. You and your kids ARE HIS FAMILY. He\u2019s choosing other people over you. He needs to change or you\u2019re going to grow more unhappy and resentful. Your kids will see this and think it\u2019s acceptable to be in a home where your person doesn\u2019t respect you. YTA for sticking up for him and not yourself and by extension your kids", "\u201cOther than this issue I have no complaints\u201d- you have a laundry list of issues in your post OP. You guys need a marriage counselor asap", "He's not trying to make everyone happy. He's trying to avoid doing anything by forcing you into the position of bad guy. He's made you into the villain so he doesn't have to say anything, and that's just cowardice, and you get to beat the brunt of it.", "You are his family, and your children are his blood family. He is a grown adult and has been one for almost ten years now. Whether or not they like it, at this point you and your kids are his primary family, and his parents and siblings are more of an extended family. \n\nYou can either sit him down and have a very tough, honest conversation about the situation, and establish some reasonable boundaries, or you can do nothing and live like this for the rest of your life. Because they won't change, and he won't change without any input on how his actions affect your family.", "Please look into narcissism, and gas lighting. It sounds to me a bit like you  just like me are so used to gas lighting you gas light yourself. I think your husbands parents are narcissists and he\u2019s learned survival techniques. He may not even be happy doing so. Please reread the comment by gramsknows and really let it sink in. The I start blaming myself hit me hard. You are not the problem nor doing anything wrong.", "Your kids stay with you!   Take them to Disney or have a cozy Christmas at home, whatever.\n\nEdit - when I said your husband can take your kids without you I meant occasional visits not major holidays sorry that wasn\u2019t clear", "No you and hubby and kids stay home for Christmas. Then he can take the kids after Boxing Day to see them but they have to be back before new years so you can celebrate as a family. The family he created with you ranks higher then his other family. I mean I\u2019m betting that he wasn\u2019t taught to prioritize his grandparents over his mother so why does he think your children have to do that?"]}
