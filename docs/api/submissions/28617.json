If I have misinterpreted and it really was more about it being ugly than trying to save your daughter from looking like she\u2019d soiled herself, then I would agree that you would be the AH because ugly is a matter of taste. Your MIL is out of line entirely. I do wonder if the way the whole thing was explained to your husband gave him the wrong impression.

When she was little she would choose things that she liked without considering whether they go together (think polka dot top with a striped skirt and leggings with flowers - all in clashing colours). \n\nAs she has grown older, her sense of style has evolved, and at 14 she has the confidence to own her own unique style.

If your daughter thinks she looks cute, let her have her sense of identity. The way teens are now, this trend will be out of style by next month, let her wear the poo skirt for now. She\u2019s exploring how to express herself through fashion, which is a beautiful thing.
