This would not be a look she is getting her bearings on and learning to grow her style and sense of self - this is her looking like she pooped herself. \n\nAnd yeah, sure pooping yourself and wearing the clothes is unlikely, but blood stains turns brown, so honestly I bet it could also look like an old period stain and someone would tell her \u201c\u2026 did you get your period and not realize?\u201d It\u2019s a kindness.\n\nSorry, I did not judge on what you actually asked on.

If I have misinterpreted and it really was more about it being ugly than trying to save your daughter from looking like she\u2019d soiled herself, then I would agree that you would be the AH because ugly is a matter of taste. Your MIL is out of line entirely. I do wonder if the way the whole thing was explained to your husband gave him the wrong impression.

When she was little she would choose things that she liked without considering whether they go together (think polka dot top with a striped skirt and leggings with flowers - all in clashing colours). \n\nAs she has grown older, her sense of style has evolved, and at 14 she has the confidence to own her own unique style.

She luckily kept her job but after that she refused to wear skirts or dresses since they were ruined for her. They no longer felt safe. It was extremely sad seeing her change her whole style because some idiots were gross. She always told all the girls she wished she could dress that way still, but it just made her feel vulnerable now. After that, she bought a couple of pairs of Spanx in every size imaginable a teen might fit in. Any girl who wanted to wear a dress or skirt to school were welcomed to come to her room to borrow them if they didn't have their own. She pulled me aside one day when I was wearing a dress to ask if I wanted to borrow a pair. I was really grateful she offered but I didn't need them.
