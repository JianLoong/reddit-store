She is incredibly ungrateful for everything she has. I let her and her best friend share her bedroom(her best friend has less fortunate parents), and they don't contribute to any household chores. I even had to start hiding pots and pans from them because I didn't want them to use my nice kitchen supplies. Her room is constantly a mess despite the many attempts I have made to get her to straighten up. I told her in November that she needed to find a place to put some old pageant dresses she had been keeping in the garage. She said she didn't have space anywhere in her room. I told her she has 2 weeks to do something with them or I will. She didn't touch them. I burned the dresses with our trash one morning after the 2 weeks. My daughter came outside and immediately started shouting at me to not touch her stuff and said I was crazy, etc. I told her I was sorry but that I had told her she needed to do something with them. She said this was the last straw and made a long snapchat post about how \"tired\" she is of how I treated her. I told my other daughter, Kori (23f) who showed it to me, that a few weeks after Rose went back to school, I was going to move her room into storage. Rose found out about this last month and told me I was being unfair and a coward for not telling her myself. I didn't respond. I was so hurt and upset that my daughter would talk about me negatively online I couldn't talk to her. I asked my husband to tell her that I'm waiting on an apology from her before I will speak to her again.\n\nAfter my husband told her, Rose came and got her things. The day after, Rose posted another lengthy rant about what a sad excuse of a mother I was on Facebook. She said she won't talk to me unless I go to therapy. I'm beginning to think I may be the AH for kicking her out. Her reaction was intense, but she is my daughter.\n\nUpdate: I forgot to mention that Rose is Autistic. Because of this, she has always been very difficult to communicate with, and I have tried my best over the years but it is possible I was going about it wrong. I never asked her to do chores, but I would make comments hinting at it so that I didn't have to directly tell her. She's 19, I didn't think I'd have to ask her to wash her dishes, but I realize this probably contributed to our relationship problems.

You are upset about your daughter trash-talking you online, and airing out your dirty laundry online.  But here you are doing the exact same thing on Reddit.  People are allowed to talk about their family problems with others, including strangers on the internet, and they are allowed to give honest opinions in those conversations.  Your daughter may be the AH for doing it on facebook, since facebook isn't anonymous.  But as long as she isn't attaching any information that would be able to identify you, she doesn't have to apologize for talking about you.\n2. When you heard your daughter talk about how \"horribly\" you treat her, instead of listening to her point of view and trying to understand her feelings, trying to come talk to your daughter and figure out what you did to hurt her, you just got all huffy and demanded an apology.  Your daughter basically laid out her feelings and laid out all this pain she was experiencing, and you didn't care about that.  You only cared about your ego.  You basically just said \"I'm hurt that you said that I hurt you.\"  Which is a really AH thing to say and do.\n3. You told her to \"do something\" with the dresses.  But she had no where else in the house to put them and you didn't help her find any other alternative solutions.  And when it came time to get rid of them, you chose to burn perfectly good articles of clothing instead of selling or donating them.\n4. People with autism struggle with executive function.  This makes chores and keeping a tidy space difficult.  If you don't know what executive function is: basically it's your brains ability to organize and execute tasks, and carry them through to completion.  But instead of helping her, you just judge her.\n5. You aren't allowing your daughter to use good cooking utensils because.... you want her to live off take out or something?\n6. You admit your daughter is autistic, and yet you also admit you aren't using autism-friendly, direct ways of communicating with her, and then you are getting angry when she doesn't do what you want.\n7. People with disabilities very often live lives of poverty without familial support, since basic \"adult\" things like finishing college, getting and keeping a job, etc, can be extra difficult for them.  If you kick her out now it is going to be extraordinarily difficult for her to get on her feet and be independent.\n8. She is ungrateful, you say?  sorry, parents, but your kids don't owe you gratitude for raising them and caring for them.

Its certainly a sign of parent that doesn't communicate effectively and only thinks about their needs, what they want and complains when people don't mind read. Even in your own words it sounds like you are the AH.", "Omg you BURNT her stuff, never communicated with her and instead made passive aggressive comments to her about cleaning, never gave her clear rules (any child needs that, autistic or not), and then you conspired behind her back to kick her out? And THEN  as a cherry on the top of the cake, you\u2019re giving her the silent treatment and getting her father to be the middle man? Is this really what I\u2019m reading lmao? This is abusive, and you truly do need therapy. This is not coming from a place of hate, I truly wish you will get into therapy and do some damage control before you lose both of your children. Think about this, and give your kid a sincere apology, followed by changed actions asap and then seek help. Please.", "You BURNED THE DRESSES.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot of wrong with your post, but let\u2019s focus on this. You were upset that your daughter didn\u2019t\u2026what? Sell the dresses? Give them to a resale shop? Donate? So you took matters into your own hands. Okay. Instead of doing any of those things YOU BURNED THEM.\n\nI\u2019m upset at this for environmental reasons, but let\u2019s stick to the relationship aspect. What did you hope to accomplish here? There would be no possible reaction except anger from Rose. Even if she didn\u2019t like those dresses, you admit that they\u2019re hers and you destroyed them. Because\u2026they were in the same place they\u2019ve already been stored for a while?\n\nDid you really think that burning them would make her suddenly turn into a clean person? A person who does dishes? You see that that\u2019s irrational right?\n\nThe only possible motivation here was vindictiveness. You were annoyed by her so you wanted to get her back. This is a human reaction, but you took it to a bonkers extreme, especially considering you\u2019re the parent. And then you made a show of giving her the silent treatment and pulled your husband into the charade.\n\nPLEASE get it together. Apologize to your daughter and start therapy before you lose her for good.", "You RAISED an autistic daughter and you still have zero clue about autism? She\u2019s right, YTA for so many reasons but that was enough for me. You\u2019re her parent, you\u2019re supposed to be her safety in the world, and you made it so she can\u2019t even communicate effectively with you and blamed her for things she couldn\u2019t understand\u2026..", "YTA. You sound insufferable. And this is from your own words. I can only imagine what your daughter has to say about your ... ahem, quirks.", "I forgot to mention my daughter is autistic. Did you also forget to parent? YTA", "You really hate your daughter do you? YTA", ">  told me I was being unfair and a coward for not telling her myself. \n\nShe's totally right about this one.\n\n> I never asked her to do chores, but I would make comments hinting at it so that I didn't have to directly tell her.\n\nWHAT? \n\nthat's the exact opposite of what you should do! \nYou can't get upset at someone because they didn't figure out your subtle clues \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI'm totally all for adults moving out and setting their own rules in their place, and it's the right move in this case too. \nBut you're totally YTA, for how you treat your dathuger as some alien that can't be talked to.", "Woah woah woah. Wait.\nSo you spoiled her rotten, never asked her to do anything. She was in pageants, which we all know pageant girls are overworked, often abused, and sexualized. And now that she's grown and doesn't do anything, you're surprised. Then you update to sprinkle in she's autistic. You purposefully withheld the information you were going to kick her out, so you could evict her without notice. \nYTA.\nEVERYONE INVOLVED NEEDS THERAPY. You because you're a major asshole and a possible narcissist. You only reacted once she removed your mask of being a perfect mother for everyone to see. Her because she was possibly raised by a narcissistic asshole.", "Your daughter is right. You're such a poor excuse for a mother. This is no way to handle a pretty straightforward scenario.", "YTA. Just say you hate your daughter for being autistic and go.\n\nHope Rose can find a way nicer life away from you.", "YTA\u2026it sounds as if you have some issues yourself and your daughter is right.  You need therapy.  Why in the world would you burn the dresses instead of donating them?  Why did they have to have a different place then where they were?  There is so much more to this than dresses.  You need help.", "God I hope this is a troll post...  No one can be this unaware???\n\nIn case it isn't a troll post, yes, yes you are the AH... Of the highest order.\n\nYou hide the pots and pans.. But at the time, didn't the girls live there?  Why would you not want them to cook food?\n\nYou burn your daughters dresses instead of helping her find a way to properly store them.. why??  Were they hurting anything or was it just a way to control her?  It's a flat awful thing to do to your child whom y0ou are supposed to love and care for. \n\nIf you never really communicated things you wanted her to do or taught her how to do them.. how do you expect her to do them?   You can't just hint at people then get pissed that they didn't do what you wanted when you NEVER ASKED THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.   \n\nYou need some serious counseling.   You've basically destroyed your relationship with your daughter.", "YTA and a huge WTF??\n\nThis whole thing reads like you hate your daughter! I don't mean frustrated hate because she won't tidy her room, I mean a real, visceral sense of hatred.\n\nEvery autistic person is different, but there are a number of common traits. Most people I know who are on the spectrum are very, very literal. To them, burning their clothes would be like saying you want to burn them!\n\nThere's no coming back from this. Sure, you could go to therapy, (and boy does it sound like you need it), but that won't change the things you have already done. She's out, she's free, and she's gone NC with you. I hope for her sake it stays that way.", "I thought you were an awful person and parent before the update. Jesus Christ YTA", "Why would you burn the dresses? Just donate them.

She is incredibly ungrateful for everything she has.\"", "I already found her to be a pretty horrible parent, but then to add that the daughter is autistic and she never tells her things directly but more so hint at them? And then hold the daughtet accountable and punish her for not picking up on the clues, that her mom knows she will struggle to pick up? \n\nJesus christ she really does need to go to therapy. Either she needs help figuring out why what she is doing is unreasonable and harmfull, or she could even be undiagnosed herself and repeating the expectations and communication patternst that were forced on her. Neither make her behaviour ok and she needs to figure it out before she causes more harm", "The daughter should have had the opportunity to sell those dresses for a profit.", "Burning the dresses was overkill. She could have asked her to sell them for money.", "Maybe op gets her knowledge from autism speaks", "Autistic person here and I agree with this completely. Also who the heck burns clothes, double TA because that is bad for the environment.. she could have taken some to donate. I agree with the daughter.. she needs therapy, in general.. and who knows maybe the therapy will help her understand her daughter. (One can only hope)", "Ikr?
