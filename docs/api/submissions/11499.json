She is incredibly ungrateful for everything she has. I let her and her best friend share her bedroom(her best friend has less fortunate parents), and they don't contribute to any household chores. I even had to start hiding pots and pans from them because I didn't want them to use my nice kitchen supplies. Her room is constantly a mess despite the many attempts I have made to get her to straighten up. I told her in November that she needed to find a place to put some old pageant dresses she had been keeping in the garage. She said she didn't have space anywhere in her room. I told her she has 2 weeks to do something with them or I will. She didn't touch them. I burned the dresses with our trash one morning after the 2 weeks. My daughter came outside and immediately started shouting at me to not touch her stuff and said I was crazy, etc. I told her I was sorry but that I had told her she needed to do something with them. She said this was the last straw and made a long snapchat post about how \"tired\" she is of how I treated her. I told my other daughter, Kori (23f) who showed it to me, that a few weeks after Rose went back to school, I was going to move her room into storage. Rose found out about this last month and told me I was being unfair and a coward for not telling her myself. I didn't respond. I was so hurt and upset that my daughter would talk about me negatively online I couldn't talk to her. I asked my husband to tell her that I'm waiting on an apology from her before I will speak to her again.\n\nAfter my husband told her, Rose came and got her things. The day after, Rose posted another lengthy rant about what a sad excuse of a mother I was on Facebook. She said she won't talk to me unless I go to therapy. I'm beginning to think I may be the AH for kicking her out. Her reaction was intense, but she is my daughter.\n\nUpdate: I forgot to mention that Rose is Autistic. Because of this, she has always been very difficult to communicate with, and I have tried my best over the years but it is possible I was going about it wrong. I never asked her to do chores, but I would make comments hinting at it so that I didn't have to directly tell her. She's 19, I didn't think I'd have to ask her to wash her dishes, but I realize this probably contributed to our relationship problems.

You are upset about your daughter trash-talking you online, and airing out your dirty laundry online.  But here you are doing the exact same thing on Reddit.  People are allowed to talk about their family problems with others, including strangers on the internet, and they are allowed to give honest opinions in those conversations.  Your daughter may be the AH for doing it on facebook, since facebook isn't anonymous.  But as long as she isn't attaching any information that would be able to identify you, she doesn't have to apologize for talking about you.\n2. When you heard your daughter talk about how \"horribly\" you treat her, instead of listening to her point of view and trying to understand her feelings, trying to come talk to your daughter and figure out what you did to hurt her, you just got all huffy and demanded an apology.  Your daughter basically laid out her feelings and laid out all this pain she was experiencing, and you didn't care about that.  You only cared about your ego.  You basically just said \"I'm hurt that you said that I hurt you.\"  Which is a really AH thing to say and do.\n3. You told her to \"do something\" with the dresses.  But she had no where else in the house to put them and you didn't help her find any other alternative solutions.  And when it came time to get rid of them, you chose to burn perfectly good articles of clothing instead of selling or donating them.\n4. People with autism struggle with executive function.  This makes chores and keeping a tidy space difficult.  If you don't know what executive function is: basically it's your brains ability to organize and execute tasks, and carry them through to completion.  But instead of helping her, you just judge her.\n5. You aren't allowing your daughter to use good cooking utensils because.... you want her to live off take out or something?\n6. You admit your daughter is autistic, and yet you also admit you aren't using autism-friendly, direct ways of communicating with her, and then you are getting angry when she doesn't do what you want.\n7. People with disabilities very often live lives of poverty without familial support, since basic \"adult\" things like finishing college, getting and keeping a job, etc, can be extra difficult for them.  If you kick her out now it is going to be extraordinarily difficult for her to get on her feet and be independent.\n8. She is ungrateful, you say?  sorry, parents, but your kids don't owe you gratitude for raising them and caring for them.

Many autistic people prefer that you communicate directly instead of hinting around. OP might have learned that if she took the time to learn about autism. YTA", "Hopping on to say that I have ADHD and that's different than autsim BUT one of the things we have in common is just doing things when we see them having to be done, I have been working hard on this my WHOLE EFFING LIFE. My parents still have to ask me to do things. \n\nI hate it because it makes me look like an idiot and my parents hate it because they are constantly having to remind me to do obvious shit. It's a STRUGGLE.\n\nWhat you need to do is get your head out of your ass and realize that her brain DOES NOT work the same as yours does and learn to communicate with her in a way her brain will understand.\n\nYTA be a better parent to your daughter.\n\nEdit: Why God's creation would you BURN those dresses?! What IS wrong with you??", "The missing missing reasons, as it were", "OP is 38 with a 23 year old daughter.  \n\nShe's been a parent since 15.  Her maturing seems to have frozen in her teen years.", "So what I\u2019m gathering is you\u2019re refusing to admit your own mistakes blaming your daughter for your failure to communicate with her properly? Am I following that right?", "*\". . .still always welcome at home.\"* **bullshite! --->** *\". . .I'm waiting on an apology from her* ***before I will speak to her again.****\"***<---**\n\n\"**Our(?)** mistakes. . .?\" Who's? You and hubby? Because all I see is an Autistic woman who never learned how to be a person because she was treated like crap for not understanding how to be \"normal.\" She is the product of your childrearing. She is the product of your unwillingness to take even a moment (it seems like) throughout your entire life, to even TRY to learn about her and how her brain works. She probably spent her whole life wondering, \"Why does my mom hate me so much? What am I doing wrong? Why can I not see or do what others do?\" I know that's how I felt. And don't pull that, \"I hAvE 5 KiDs.\" B.S. you have hubby too, he should have been parenting with you, he should have been taking the time to learn too. And there are plenty of people, THOUSANDS of people some who are single parents, have kids (MULTIPLE KIDS EVEN!) with neuro-divergences AND other disabilities and guess what? THEY TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN ABOUT HOW THEIR KIDS WORK!\n\n*\"I would hate for Rose to think she is unwelcome for holidays.\"* Um. . .seriously? **--->** *\". . .****before I will speak to her again.****\"***<---** She already knows she's not welcome.", "Right? I'm a bit surprised at people pointing out that subtly hinting doesn't work with autistic people, too. As if non-autistic teenagers do the dishes when their mom subtly hints about it. That's just not how 99% of teenagers work.", "We are neuro-DIVERGANT! We LITERALLY do not operate the same way neuro-typical people do. WE **DO** NEED DIRECT COMUNICATION!!!  \n\"Hey, you left some dirty dishes on the counter.\" Ok, you are telling me about objects I left in a specific spot, while I do not understand why you made that statement, you made a statement, so that is a thing in my brain now.\n\n\"Hey, could you wash the dishes you left on the counter?\" AH! I have been asked to clean up after myself.\n\nI'm sorry to say this, but your relationship will never be the same, pull you fecking pants up and take the time to learn about your own daughters condition. Look up resources online about Autism, find local groups, whatever. BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GODS DO SOMETHING TO EDUCATE YOURSELF. And if you do want the chance to make up with her, do it now rather than later.", "That's not an excuse at all", "YTA. It's amazing you say her friend has less fortunate parents with absolutely no sence of irony. Rose has very unfortunate parents too.", "Then Stop having kids. Unless rose is the youngest of five that\u2019s on your for having more kids than you could reasonably parent", "I don\u2019t like to kid shame parents, but it was your choice to have five children. That\u2019s the job you signed up for. If you have a child with autism, it\u2019s your job to make sure their needs are met regardless of how many kids are in your household.", "Sweet fuck, you have 5 KIDS. Get your damn tubes tied if you haven't already.  It's obvious you shouldn't have any more.", "Makes me miss the ol' trailer park!\n\nMmm, mmm, burning plastic!", "I had to help a friend get a restraining order on her abusive ex once. He was really bad, like, bad, and they lived together.\n\nWhen the cops got rid of him and then left the first thing she did was make a fire...\n\nThrew in the outfit he was wearing when they met, threw in some photos, letters, an old dried rose, etc..\n\nYeah, burning things definitely has some meaning to it. It was something watching her go.", "also am I the only one that thinks putting your kid in pageants isn\u2019t the same as actually parenting them? If anything, that would just emotionally mess her daughter up more", "Op basically admits she stopped trying to parent and then wonders why rose is difficult. Maybe cause her own parents didn\u2019t parent her, duh."]}
