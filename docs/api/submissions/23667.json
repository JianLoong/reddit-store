I never wanted them here in the first place due to past issues, but after speaking with my husband, we decided for the sake of the young children to give them a place to stay. Before they moved in, we set some ground rules such as my BIL must be actively job searching and that they must RESPECT our space and clean up after themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, in the past month, they have began to slowly destroy my home and my space without giving two shits. First of all, my SIL is an extremely picky eater so their family doesn't eat with us. Fine. BUT they never ever clean up after themselves, constantly leaving dirty dishes and pans, crumbs, food stains. When I tell them to clean after themselves, they begrudgingly do but it's never a job well done. Last week, one of the boys had peed on my very expensive couch which i ONLY found out about after smelling piss when I was watching TV. SIL is stay-at-home but she's more like stay-in-her-room, doing god knows what while her two children run rampant around my house. In the last three weeks, her boys have 1) colored on their bedroom walls 2) trashed my living room with their toys 3) knocked over half of my plant collection. Their whole family has turned my house into a fucking zoo while contributing NOTHING.\n\nI've not been able to comfortably live in my own space for the past few weeks. My husband could sense my frustration so he told me he'd have a talk with them and hire a maid to clean our house. Things got a little better UNTIL...yesterday, I get home early from work and their family's gone. Good, I think, peace and quiet for a few hours. I decide to go take a nap in our bedroom ONLY TO FIND THAT MY PRECIOUS VASE THAT MY MOTHER HANDMADE FOR ME WAS SHATTERED ON THE GROUND (I lost my mom when I was a teen and it is one of the last handmade items I have from her). I immediately knew it was the boys because there were toys inside my room and their tablet was on my bed.\n\nI was so angry. I ended up calling my husband, explaining the situation, and told him that they would not stay another day in our house, no questions asked. Then I went around the house picking up their dirty clothes, toys, papers, etc. and threw them outside onto our lawn.\n\nWhen they came back, there was a huge confrontation between me and them. I listed all the disrespectful things they'd done and that because they'd met NONE of the conditions outlined when they first moved in, I wanted them off my property by midnight. I called their kids untrained dogs. They screamed back calling me heartless, cruel, evil, saying I'd make them homeless. Well they did end up leaving after I threatened to call the cops. Husband is fully on my side but I can tell he feels a little bad. MIL called me, upset, asking me to take them back in after I \"forced them to sleep in their car\" last night.

I also understand not wishing to pay for the fare, but if it truly eliminates this headache from your life for good isn't it worth it? \n\nI am not saying they would accept the offer or MIL will agree. Once you put it out there both of them can no longer say you made them homeless though.", "Gee, what a surprise"]}
