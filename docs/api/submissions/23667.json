Before they moved in, we set some ground rules such as my BIL must be actively job searching and that they must RESPECT our space and clean up after themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, in the past month, they have began to slowly destroy my home and my space without giving two shits. First of all, my SIL is an extremely picky eater so their family doesn't eat with us. Fine. BUT they never ever clean up after themselves, constantly leaving dirty dishes and pans, crumbs, food stains. When I tell them to clean after themselves, they begrudgingly do but it's never a job well done. Last week, one of the boys had peed on my very expensive couch which i ONLY found out about after smelling piss when I was watching TV. SIL is stay-at-home but she's more like stay-in-her-room, doing god knows what while her two children run rampant around my house. In the last three weeks, her boys have 1) colored on their bedroom walls 2) trashed my living room with their toys 3) knocked over half of my plant collection. Their whole family has turned my house into a fucking zoo while contributing NOTHING.\n\nI've not been able to comfortably live in my own space for the past few weeks. My husband could sense my frustration so he told me he'd have a talk with them and hire a maid to clean our house.

I decide to go take a nap in our bedroom ONLY TO FIND THAT MY PRECIOUS VASE THAT MY MOTHER HANDMADE FOR ME WAS SHATTERED ON THE GROUND (I lost my mom when I was a teen and it is one of the last handmade items I have from her). I immediately knew it was the boys because there were toys inside my room and their tablet was on my bed.\n\nI was so angry. I ended up calling my husband, explaining the situation, and told him that they would not stay another day in our house, no questions asked. Then I went around the house picking up their dirty clothes, toys, papers, etc. and threw them outside onto our lawn.\n\nWhen they came back, there was a huge confrontation between me and them. I listed all the disrespectful things they'd done and that because they'd met NONE of the conditions outlined when they first moved in, I wanted them off my property by midnight. I called their kids untrained dogs. They screamed back calling me heartless, cruel, evil, saying I'd make them homeless. Well they did end up leaving after I threatened to call the cops.

Quit social loafing", "Absolutely this. Unless MiL finds another solution MiL has no input and can shut up.\n\nNTA all day long. I'd have kicked them out the day they left urine on a communal sofa. Which is disgusting.", "This. Part of the story is how your husband stood with you on this. The vase is a reminder of that fact.", "And when someone offers them a place to stay, they don't lift a finger to make sure they get to stay there, even though they agreed to the rules...

You shouldn\u2019t have called them names or be upset about them, it\u2019s fully on their parents. All they did is what any unsupervised toddler will do. \n\nJust because if this ESH.

You didn\u2019t have to drag the kids though, they\u2019re young enough to not be able to help it.  MIL sounds like she\u2019s volunteered herself to take them in, or at least the kids.  This is so sad \ud83d\ude1e. The mother being a SAHM sounds bad considering they are homeless, but they probably can\u2019t afford childcare, so that\u2019s too bad.

This situation just sucks.", "Semi not the ah, I wouldn\u2019t have thrown their things on the lawn, I would have packed it up and put it outside and certainly wouldn\u2019t have name called the kids\u2026.because ultimately their behaviour is a result of evidently absent parents\u2026..so more likely would have called them unfit parents \ud83d\ude05\n\nMIL should have put her hand up to help them instead \n\nBut yeah they didn\u2019t respect you, your space or your boundaries even after discussing with them after they moved it", "YTA for calling her kids untrained dogs and not paying for a cheap motel or something even for a few weeks", "When you agree to have tenants then you have a moral obligation to give them a priper eviction notification even if you allow them to live there for free.

She said her husband is on her side.", "I think you are harshing the hubby a bit.  He played it the best he could.  He went WAY above and beyond his familial obligations, took steps to minimize the impact on OP, gave his brother's family enough rope to hang themselves and then let OP play executioner!   Letting OP force the eviction makes it easier on him when dealing with mom.  It might sound weasely, but it's easier to tell your mom, \"I've got to stand by my wife,\" than, \"I'm not going to help my brother.\"  \n\nHonestly, I can see a sitcom doing an episode like this, where we are all stressed out for our protagonists but the last scene is OP and hubby doing an Oceans 11-style walk through of the maticuluously detailed, step-by-step plan to get them out in as short as time as possible and mot make themselves look like the bad guys.  We also find out that the vase is just one of several bought for a thrift store and placed around the house giving the monsters ample opportunity to f up.   \n\nHubby and OP are now free from ever needed to help losers again!  In hindsight, the only thing that could have been better was securing valuables.  Sorry about that OP.\n\nMom was bitching about brother being homeless, when it sounds like brother is a homeless person who, somehow, temporarily ended up in a house.", "Are they the same kind of horrible?", "You are a saint. I would've kicked them out the first time they hurt my kid.", "I was really curious when I'd see this answer. It was indeed an unlawful eviction. Throwing their stuff on the lawn and shouting with kids present also makes this pretty bad legally.", "Lmfao, your urine comment is ridiculous. No one gets high and pees on a couch. Drunk maybe, but you'd have to be really really drunk. Notjing indicates that the inlaws have a substance use issue. It's kid pee, what a weird thing to make up.

Kids start school at 4 - by that age they shouldn't be drawing on walls, understand sone rooms are out of bounds and they can within reason regulate their own bladders.  Accidents are occasional but they only really happen if the child is unable to get to a toilet, is just too scared to ask or something frightens them - which is rare in a home environment. If accidents happen regularly outside these circumstances or potty training isn't fully set in they should be in nappies or leak proof pants.\nToys need to be tidied up but not a huge issue, but food on the floor- parents should be sweeping that up and making sure the kids continue to learn table manners.\nWhat ever stage the kids are at the parents need to get off their arses, clean and do parenting so the kids can learn correct behaviour and nip less welcome acts in the bud immediately. \nOp is nta because its her home and they aren't her kids.", "Not nearly. My brother pays rent and at least keeps to his room. SIL recently moved in 2 months ago but they are recently making plans to move.

What an AH.", "Like seriously, calling a 3 and 4 year old \"untrained dogs\", in front of them, is fine with people?  \nAccidents such as peeing on the couch at that age absolutely DO happen - heck, some kids even have the rare accident by the time they start primary school.  Drawing at the walls is more of a \"two-year old\" kind of thing, but it's not that far off at 3. Knocking over a plant, again, happens unless they're in a safe spot. Is it up to the parents to clean the mess up? Absolutely. Should they make their best effort to limit their children's (mis)behavior and prevent &/ clean up messes? Yes 100%. But this was downright cruel.   \n(That's not even considering the possibility of the kids being neurodivergent. Any chance the \"untrained dogs\" have ADHD for example? The first years are tough AF even under the perfect conditions and with the perfect professional help, which I guess the kids are not receiving).   \n\n\nOP evicting them was understandable, but the way they went about it (throwing out their stuff on the lawn, evicting them with zero notice, name-calling etc.) was awful (and possibly illegal). It honestly makes me question the rest of the story and how accurate it really was.", "Yeah no shit, but they are 3 and 4. Tough lesson kid, shouldn't mark on the walls or you'll be homeless?", "Ruining their house. Y'all are dramatic. A can of paint is 30 bucks, all in one day of painting. Lowe's has plants. The vase sucks, but it's a thing.", "You should look into kintsugi. The idea is to use epoxy and gold flake/leaf and not hide the scars left by the damage but make something new and beautiful from them. Ceramics usually make the best pieces because they're easy to get glued back together and are forgiving with pieces that don't quite line up. The gold also stands out more.\n\nHonestly kintsugi pieces are super pretty and cool and really easy to make it look better than new. Ever since I started doing it I look at broken vases as a blessing because the vases that *aren't* broken are now my most boring ones.", "I have a kid that would have totally looked me directly in the eyes after I'd told them off, and continued to draw lol.

Iirc OP states they stayed 3 weeks. She also explicitly stared they were moving in and there may be text messages confirming they moved in as well.", "Her space is bigger than a car, so sounds perfect. They were far too comfortable at your home. MIL is mom & grandma and has more responsibility than you & your husband. If BIL & family move with MIL it may be just the motivation they need to get their lives together. Either way it won't be your problem.", "Came to mention this.\n\nAnd OP, if Kintsjugi doesn\u2019t work, then making other things out if the vase is a good idea. Maybe make a mosaic frame around a pictures (or pictures) of you two?\n\nBut what you are describing reminds me of a lady I see on Insta on occasion. She takes a raw egg. Blows the insides out of the shell, leaving the shell intact. Then she draws designs in wax on the shell. The egg gets dipped in very vibrant dye. Then she draws another set of designs on the egg in wax and dips it again. She keeps repeating this or Jess process until it is \u201cdone.\u201d Then she melts all of the wax off, revealing a gorgeous design in the egg, But here comes the relevant part\u2026she smashes it. Well, smash might be too strong of a word but she does break it, she takes a piece or several pieces and puts them in lockers or other jewelry, leaving some of the wax created design intact. They are really quite pretty. Maybe you could find her for inspiration?", "That\u2019s not your problem. She can deal with it. You have done enough!", "My now 10 year old would have looked me in the eye and drawn more.
