Who made her queen of the queue. \n\nThere\u2019s a good chance both the old lady and mom were retired and on mat leave so neither likely on a tight schedule. Bold of them both to assume no one in line was on a short break and had to get back to school/work.", "Seriously, that shit is so infuriating. I\u2019ve got a great life and tbh I feel like it\u2019s because I *don\u2019t* have kids.", "Then OP should've just waited until the mom decided to try to cut, and say \"sorry, I'd like to keep my place in line, especially since I only have a couple of items\" instead of getting into actively engaging in a dispute with the old lady and then insulting the mother, who had really done nothing at all\n\nOld lady is absolutely an AH, but so is OP", "These assholes want to make sure you stay pregnant - they don\u2019t want to PAY anything to ensure a healthy pregnancy either, they just want to be the uterus police (and make sure that miscarriage wasn\u2019t YOUR fault, or that\u2019s prison time, you baby killer) - then fuck all the way off till the kid is old enough for a minimum wage job or enlistment.", "ahh, the good old days of the Catholic orphanage, where kids were trafficked and no one cared!", "You\u2019re the AH. You overstepped and freaked out over a \u201cpotential situation\u201d. You blamed a woman and a small child for your inability to control your temper in public. Maybe in the future if you don\u2019t think you can handle being outside, stay home.", "NTA\n\nI usually stay in line even if I have very few items while others have 1,000+ items in front of me and just hope someone let's me up but I don't want to be entitled so I don't say anything. Just because I have 1 bottle of water doesn't mean the one with many things hasn't been waiting in line longer and have places to be so I will not complain. BUT the lady with the baby just wanting to be upfront JUST BECAUSE she has a baby, that is asleep, in a stroller why do you need to go first? If she was still pregnant? Sure go ahead. Baby crying? Go first. But the baby is asleep in a stroller. Seems she's just using the baby as an item to get things she wants her way. \n\nThe old lady I dunno. But the whole trying to get you to have babies wtf lady? Is that all women are good for? Babies? She does know that humans are over populated and we'll sooner or later run out of food? Even if not running out of food like that's messed up. I don't want kids either. Everyone wanted me to have them when I was 5. Like NO. And said \"well you'll want them soon\" i don't mind kids much but biological kids? With my genes and mental illnesses? Sure they MIGHT look cute but I am NOT letting my hypothetical kids have my mental illnesses and I don't want my hypothetical grandkids have epilepsy either(it's genetic), mostly the girls. But I guess no one gives a s**t about the kids well being, mental health so guess I gotta have kids! If people want me kids so much THEY can have them.\n\n Older people can still have kids my grandmother had her last at 55yrs old. A couple went viral and the lady had a baby at 70 something. Grandma can have another baby. She can leave you alone. Have more babies herself if she likes them so much", "YTA initially I was for a E S H, but your attitude, your bad manners and the way you rant about the poor mother that did nothing wrong ( according to what you wrote), made me change my opinion.\nYou had any right to refuse to let someone else skip the line, that's not the thing, but you were far too aggressive, actually you made me think you were the one waiting to pick a fight.", "Yeah, I let people in front of me if they only have a couple of things, I don't check what gender they are or if they have children. \n\nI have a disability but it's 'invisible' and I struggle to wait in line.  Standing still hurts the most, but I still let people by with a small amount of items.", "Seriously, what's wrong with a quick \"hey sorry, I can't let you cut in front of me but I've just got the one item so I'll be quick!\" Nobody is legally obligated to be kind, but it makes life much more pleasant if you are.", "Must not be in my state because people don't give a flying shit if you only have 3 items. They'd rather stare for a second then turn around and act ignorant.", "I wonder if this is regional, any time I've let somebody do this they end up having all kinds of lottery ticket/complicated nicotine product the cashier can't find/behind the counter liquor requests that end up taking forever.", "The elder woman told the mom to jump the line. OP didn't give the mom a chance to answer. And nothing was said how many groceries the mom was buying. But it is common to allow anyone ahead of you when you have several items and they have a handful.", "Never heard of jumping the supermarket line because of a baby, or pregnancy.  I have let pregnant, or moms with kids ahead of me at the restroom line. Only if I am first in line and they are right behind me.", "OP isn't in the US, they're in Europe. Every major supermarket where I am has free delivery if you don't need your groceries same day.", "That's mostly an American problem. It's generally much cheaper in Europe. Where I live, the delivery fee is about the same as bus fare to and from the shop, so it's absolutely easier to order online.", "They are as a rule either 14-22 or refer to themselves as \u201celder millennials\u201d", "I would argue that we shouldn't just leave kids at home all the time even if that is an option. Kids need to spend time in public in order to become functional members of society. Is that sometimes inconvenient for others? Yes... but we were all kids once, and people put up with us even when our presence wasn't convenient or enjoyable for them.", "There used to be a guy at my local Lidl who was about twice as fast as the average Lidl checkout man. Even two of us packing together couldn\u2019t keep up with him. I like to think he\u2019s moved on to the world\u2019s busiest Lidl.", "I'm just picturing him being the celebrity speaker at the company convention and jogging out to eye of the tiger ready to pump up all his fellow Lidl team up on the enthusiasm for lightning fast swipe times.", "Being menopausal is no protection against the government once they decide that any woman at all does not have autonomy over her own body. \n\nHow far a leap is it from forced birth to forced organ harvesting?\n\nImagine this: You are a healthy menopausal or post menopausal woman. You go into the hospital for a routine medical procedure. When you wake up, you were told that while they were doing surgery they discovered that one of your kidneys was severely diseased and had to be removed. They show you records including photos and ultrasounds of the diseased kidney, but assure you that you will be fine and the kidney you have left will be more than enough to serve you for the rest of your life. You are upset but glad the kidney was found when it was, and happy that you will be okay.\n\nMeanwhile a woman of a certain income bracket is resting comfortably three floors up in the penthouse suite of the hospital after her successful kidney transplant surgery.\n\nYeah, sounds like a paranoid delusion. So did RvW overturning five years ago.", "This is why I love the trend towards self checkout! \n\nUntil someone lines up in self checkout with a whole cartload of groceries, lol. \n\nIf I do a full shopping trip, I usually do regular checkout but if I only have a handful of items I can self checkout and don\u2019t feel impatient standing behind two cartfuls of groceries.", "This response makes no sense in context to OPs reply.", "YTA - not for not wanting the mom to skip the line, but for escalating the situation. The old lady was just talking to the mom and telling her to do something. The mom didn\u2019t do anything. She didn\u2019t skip the line. The mature thing for you to have done was to ignore the comment unless it actually went any further. If the mom tried to skip the line then you could have told her \u201cno, you can\u2019t skip past me\u201d or whatever. There was absolutely no reason for you to insert yourself into a random conversation. And then your rant at the end of your post about all parents being entitled is also a dick move.", "I've just had my first 5 months ago and I've noticed that people are a lot friendlier when I've got the baby with me. To be honest a lot of people do like seeing babies in my experience. \nI've also got anxiety and it was so hard the first few times I left the house with him because he was a big crier. I didn't get any negative comments though. I think most people are mature enough to understand that babies exist and make noise.", "Meltdown? Probably not. Temper tantrum? No. It's a learning opportunity for both parent and child. These situations can't be avoided forever. Better to just learn to adapt.", "I did this when my baby was just a few months old. He woke up and started crying when I was partway done scanning items, and I figured I should just get out of there as fast as I could. The alternative would have been to pick him up and try to do the checkout one-handed, then face him getting even more upset when I put him down again and buckled him up for the walk home. I still think it was reasonable-ish, but even if it wasn't I was making a decision on very little sleep and while my body was still healing.", "On this note, can we also *not* normalise this \"just popped a kid out of her vajayjay\" misogynistic bs? Trivialising the almost 10 month process of pregnancy and the potentially life-altering/deadly act of childbirth is what contributes to the denigration of women.\n\n It makes it much easier to strip women of their bodily autonomy and force them back into the workplace too early if we refer to it as \"just\" having a child. Now, obviously this woman isn't entitled to a supermarket fast-pass or anything, but OP isn't entitled to spread everyday misogyny like they do in this post without being called out either."]}
