Most of the time I\u2019ve done that, people in line will see that I just have the returnable slip and tell me to go ahead of them.", "I would let people with a few items go in front of me for as long as it took to unload my full cart onto the belt then I\u2019d be done", "It\u2019s not a requirement, and only the person right behind you unless everyone else agrees. (You can\u2019t invite someone to cut in front of other people, only yourself.)", "Usually it's if you have a full cart/ big shop, and the person behind you has > 5 things, you let them go first. People don't generally let every single person behind them go ahead aswell (atleast in my experience).\n\nIt's not that it's your issue, it's just a nice thing to do when you realise you'll be holding that person back, when they could be done and out of the store in a couple minutes at most.", "Why is the parents' time more valuable than anyone else's? I say this as a parent.", "Throwing out that it's not an option everywhere or is VERY cost prohibitive. Grocery stores tend to charge more for items online, plus there's normally a $10 delivery fee plus tip for the driver.\n\nWe used delivery when we lived in town, but now that my neighbors are cows, and Amish we're lucky if we can get pizza delivered within 2 hours. I have to drive 40 minutes to get to Costco. It's a PITA, but worth it for the savings with 5 people in the house.", "As a parent, I\u2019ll happily wait my turn in line because that\u2019s our culture. I knew this going into parenting. I also do my best to teach my preschooler patience. I\u2019m also 8 months pregnant and don\u2019t assume anyone will do anything to help my comfort. I do whatever I can to help other families in public as long as it doesn\u2019t come at the expense of others (skipping with a line behind ME). It is what it is. \n\nHowever, I just came back from a trip to the DR where there is a huge emphasis on catering to parents of young kids, pregnant people, disabled, and elderly and it was amazing for us. I wish that culture was more places. I know that\u2019s not how it is here so I\u2019d never make presumptions that others should sacrifice their time or convenience for me. But it was lovely for the time we were there.", "No, but the mom did say people like OP make her feel uncomfortable existing which is a big jump based on the info provided.", "But I also read that the mother and old bat started talking about him", "Nothing wrong with your initial response of declining. Nothing wrong with your defence against an entitled old lady.\n\nI have a toddler and when I take her shopping, we wait in line like everyone else. Once I was offered to jump in front of a person because they had one item, but not for a second did I ever expect to jump to the front (that's not to say this mother did).\n\nIt was nice of the old lady to offer her to jump in front of her but no one else. She was clearly the asshole for expecting g others to let the mother go ahead.\n\nNTA", "The way OP describes it says that the old lady suggested the mom to do it, not hypothetically, actually do it.", ">the older lady started telling the mom to skip the queue and go to the front because she\u2019s with a child\n\nWhere are they implying this seems quite clear? I find it more logical to let OP go because she only had one item. Then this.", "Except she didn't express any desire to skip or ask to do so or lay into OP for what he said. At all. It was all between the old lady and OP (as OP confirms in the comments) and must have been embarrassing as all hell for the Mum.", "*Someone else* told her it was okay. She wasn't the one who initiated this.", "Parents always do this? Defintely not true, especially in your story since it was the elderly lady who offered, not the mom asking to skip", "No where in your story did the mum say or do anything entitled or suggest she wasn't considering others. The old lady did that. \n\nYou made that poor mum feel judged and unwelcome, for not shutting the old lady down fast enough. You sound very judgemental of all ppl with kids.", "Wait how is it \u201cparents always do this\u201d and that\u2019s why you freaked out but in another comment you admit to never speaking to the mom directly.", "Why's you even come here lmao, you and your friend who said \"her inability to use protection is not my problem\" should just circle jerk all day about how you put a woman with a child in her place \ud83d\udc80", "What world do you live in that \"parents always do this\"? Also, it's not like she was asking to cut in front of you, a total stranger suggested to her that she do, and it doesn't sound like she make any moves to do so. You're such an asshole.", "I don't agree with these people arguing with you. It sounds like the older lady was out of touch and the mom talking shit with you right there is very rude and passive aggressive. Also, the self righteous hubris it takes to just declare for everyone in line that she can just go ahead and skip to the front is pretty amazing. The *polite* thing to do for *them* in this situation would be to recognize that the gesture was not well received (and social rules would say that it would need to be a unanimous decision) and to let the issue go.", "You don\u2019t think telling an old lady to fuck off is rude? You have a lot to learn!", "So she wasn't feeling entitled, like the last line of your post implies?", "But what if she needs to buy something? What if she doesn't have a partner. I agree that she doesn't have the right to cut in line, but it's absurd to say that she's \"incompetent to go shopping\"", "Exactly. I was queuing with one item on a busy day and people in front of me who had loads of items told me to go ahead and skip in front of them.", "Re-reading the story, it seems you inserted yourself in a conversation between the elderly lady and the mother. I understand why you reacted, but personally I would have been quiet unless the elderly lady didn't shut up about it OR the mother tried to get in front of you.\n\nAs you tell the story the mother was standing around quietly not saying anything, I do not think there was a need to speak aggressively about her and her baby in the way that you did. I'm not saying the elderly lady was right either because she had no business saying that in the first place. Still ESH.", "The old lady suggested it. The mom could or could not have listened to her but OP preemptively jumped in.\n\nOP wasn't affected because nothing happened until they escalated themselves. If an old lady told me to cut in line I don't think I'd listen. People have free will after all.", "Because she'll have a whole line of people crying foul instead of you injecting yourself into their conversation and just appearing like a jerk to everyone when you start screaming swears.\n\nYou have no idea if she would have even taken the old lady's suggestion. I'm leaning on no. You based your actions on assumptions and, well, the old saying holds true here.", "I hope you have a good day, and someone do something nice to you today.", "Grow up", "\"Declining\" *what*, though? The mother *never actually asked* OP if she could skip in front of them; she just listened as the elderly lady told her she *should* skip to the front of the line. For all OP knows, the mother was just politely nodding and smiling and waiting for an opportunity to tell the elderly lady \"no, I'm alright waiting, thanks.\" OP instigated the argument by preemptively interrupting the conversation between the elderly lady and the mother.", "Yeah exactly", "The old lady was telling the Mum to skip. OP objected. The two of them had a fairly hideous argument about her life choices and what she should do which must have been so lovely for her. But of the three people in the story it's the young mother you feel is 'entitled'? ... Really?!", "I was definitely wondering if I missed something. It didn\u2019t seem like the mom was entitled at all. Unless of course that part was just left out but it seems like it was the elderly lady and the mom was just standing there. I would have been so embarrassed if I was the mother in that situation and now everyone is bashing her when in reality there is nothing saying she even uttered a word. I don\u2019t understand why people get so angry about being extra kind to pregnant women/women with children. Even though I do believe the person with the least stuff goes first (that\u2019s just common decency) but geesh it is a tough job being pregnant or having kids and while no one told anyone to do it or to get old or whatever the case can\u2019t we just be nice and understanding. Again not saying the world stops for babies/pregnancy but the harshness on Reddit always amazes me.", "And I didn't say anything to her", "Just because you don\u2019t encounter those situations doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t happen", "I never judged the mom", "I don\u2019t see how those two things contraindicate each other.", "lmao seriously this reads like a 17 year old who just decided they were \"childfree\" creating a /thathappened post", "Just because it doesn\u2019t happen to you doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen to others.", "Look she was telling me how I\u2019m a horrible person for not letting the mom skip the line and how I will regret not having kids and how I\u2019m making wrong choices in my life. She was insulting me left and right. I\u2019m not into letting people bully me just because", "I never said she was entitled I said parents in general. Don\u2019t twist my words and use them how you wish", "Then she can wait in line...?\n\nOP isn't saying she's not allowed to go shopping, peripd, just that she should have to wait in line like everyone else.", "She can always shop online. Look the baby is sleeping in a stroller, there\u2019s nothing to handle all she has to do is push a stroller forward every few minutes. I just wanted to tell that I did not see why she couldn\u2019t wait in line like everybody else it\u2019s not like she had a screaming baby in her hands", "I did not tell anything about the baby until the old lady started telling me how it\u2019s the rule we should let mothers skip the line no matter what", "Leaning on no is also an assumption and I\u2019m not stopping a mom with a stroller while she\u2019s walking just to tell her to go to the back of the line. I think it\u2019s easier to tell that I do not agree with something right away rather than wait until the last second.", "I\u2019m in my 20s I doubt I\u2019ll grow any more", "So?\n\n\nYou made this post just to rant about mom/kids. You should be mad at the old lady for meddling.", "But you had no issues dragging her into it. Using her has a prop isn't the kindness that you think that it is.", "You said she should leave the kid at home which is not always possible for people. That is judging. Doesn't give her the right to cut in line but doesn't make your response any better either", "The mom didn\u2019t try to do anything though. So how was it the parent always doing this?", "It didn't happen to you in this story, so it's irrelevant. You're using people who have nothing to do with the actual issue at hand to be an AH. I mean \"just because it doesn't happen to you...\" friend, it didn't happen to you either that day, lmfao.", "Right back atcha honey.", "Ok, so you went from a specific situation and then ended with generalities, weaving it in as if it was relevant \n\nI say ESH, don't argue with strangers about personal life choices. No one wins", "Except she never once asked to skip the line, nor did she try to do so. She was dragged into it by OP and the old lady. OP even says in comments several times that she never spoke to the mother at all, and the mother didn't ask for anything.", "Don't worry, I think we are comprehending now why random strangers think you're a jerk.", "She can always shop online??? Um no. For plenty of reasons that is not always sufficient. For comments like these \u2014 YTA. 100%. You don\u2019t need to give up your spot, but the way you handled this is unhinged.", "This ain't a debate parlor: I said what I said and I'm sticking with it. Dislike it all you want.", "Waiting the last second? More like waiting to see if there's even something to respond to. I've also had older people tell me I should do something because I had my kids with me. Doesn't mean I did what they told me to do. That's what make you the AH here.", "Maybe true.", "I never said I was mad at mom I only said I was tired of parents being entitled", "Well the old lady didn\u2019t have to drag an entire queue of people into this, it\u2019s not like I started it", "I said if she can\u2019t handle the child she should leave him at home not that she should leave him at home just because the child exists.

From your story, only you felt the need to have a meltdown. She didn't drag anyone into anything. The mom did nothing, and you inserted yourself into a conversation that didn't include you. You've said yourself that the mom didn't ask to skip or try to do so. You didn't even give her a chance to respond before dragging her into your bullshit.", "Yeah see this is why I'm going yta \n\nYou didn't have to let anyone skip but from this mom's point of view \n\nA nice old lady offers her to skip in line, then some random stranger starts ranting about how she's entitled and should leave the kid at home when she literally did nothing. If you had a problem with the old lady then rant about the old lady being entitled to offer favours on behalf of others, not the poor woman just caught between the two of you.", "But that\u2019s not this situation.

She didn\u2019t ask to skip the line, and you haven\u2019t said she even tried to. Just made some snarky remarks after you implied she shouldn\u2019t be in public with her kid.
