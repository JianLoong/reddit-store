Alternatively, A could loan her a coat or an umbrella for a few days if he's so concerned. Or L & A take the dogs on leash with them to the station before it rains and L walks them back alone. This is not in any way an emergency situation & it isn't your problem to resolve. They have plenty of options.", "NTA, how can a person afford to own two dogs, pay for a trip for a few days but cannot afford boarding? Boarding your dogs is part of the cost of owning dogs. The owner sounds irresponsible, I'd be very careful about this as this won't be the last time, make it very clear to your friend that your living space is shared, you need to be consulted beforehand as basic respect and that they cannot ask you for help looking after them. This won't be the last time and your roommate is lacking basic respect for you, first this? What's next?"]}
