It sounds like this man needs more help than just bandage changes. Social services should intervene.", "NTA.\n\n\nYou did it out of concern for the kid. This obviously started to negatively affect the kid's life one way or another. The father needs to get his feet issue checked before it gets even worse.", "info.

Or the girls mother? I don't know discharge that would smell like that. I mean I had an armpit wound that needed dressed. But I just don't know how the daughter is getting it on her person. The mother needs to take her daughter or figure out some way of getting a nurse in to change the dressings.", "INFO: If you\u2019re going to post something this side why even bother?", "As long as the mother is in the picture there isn't really anything that can be done. And smelling bad isn't really a safeguarding issue. The only play you should have really made was to talk to the mother but other than that. Not much you can do. Maybe talk to the school she goes to. The teachers must say something or have an opinion.", "Info: does she seem well taken care of, aside from smelling like this discharge? Him not taking good care of himself doesn\u2019t automatically translate into being a neglectful or abusive parent.", "YTA\n\nNot your monkey and not your circus. You claim that the daughter can't make friends because of the smell? Really? IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS UNLESS THE CHILD IS IN DANGER. You have some nerve calling in the cops and CPS for something as mundane as a bad smell? You have no business poking your nose into someone else's life.", "YTA.

This is a very bad health situation waiting to happen.", "That stench sounds like gangrene. He could die from that if he doesn't get medical treatment, possibly including amputations. Maybe a welfare check is needed, before that little girl finds her father dead?\n\nNot to diagnose over the internet, but this kind of thing can happen when someone has uncontrolled diabetes for a long time.\n\nAnyway, NTA!"]}
