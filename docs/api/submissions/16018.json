Social services evaluates what a family needs and takes steps to meet those needs. Parenting classes, financial assistance, home repair, nutrition education, the list goes on. \n\nThey don\u2019t come in and immediately remove children unless the child has physical signs of corporal punishment or torture, or the child self-reported sexual abuse.

This is negligence. Whether OP was a mandated reporter or not she needed to report this to get help to all three of them as a responsible community member. (Also, where tf are this child\u2019s teachers!? How have they not taken action?)\n\nPeople have this asinine idea that calling social services equates to trying to get a child taken away from parents. That has not been the goal of any of the 15 or so allegations I\u2019ve had to make in my career \u2013 nor has it been the outcome of any. Parenting is hard and people need social support. Sometimes agencies are the only way to get it to them, and that doesn\u2019t make the caller a bad person."]}
