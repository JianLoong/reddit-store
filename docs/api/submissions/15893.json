She named him after our late grandfather, who is my godfather. Let's call him Sam. \n\nWe love the kid very much, but my gf and me were sitting on that name as well for our first child. My sister knew this. She didn't talk to us beforehand, but just dropped the name on us when she just gave birth. On the phone. \n\nI had an emotional reaction. I felt like she didn't respect me enough to talk things through or at least give me fair warning in advance. Things kind of escalated from there. We got over it relatively quick but now my sister is angry because she blames me for not being there for her in a difficult time (the baby was premature). I really tried to be, but she kind of shut down every attempt at conversation. She said she has every right to pick that name, that she didn't steal anything from us, that choosing a name is 100% the choice of the parents... \n\nIt took months but after a lot of effort we got things back to normal. Flash forward to autumn 2022, me and my gf get pregnant.\n\nWe have been discussing the name for a very long time. We considered a lot of options, but our harts just kept on saying it has to be Sam. It's a name that holds so much emotion, we have built the idea of having children together around this name. Our kid has always been Sam in our heads. We knew that my sister was going to have a hard time with it but we made the call to name our kid Sam, because otherwise we would have regretted our choice forever. \n\nWe wanted my sister to be the godmother, so about a 2 months ago we popped her the question. Of course, we also told her the name we chose. We didn't want to put her in the same position that she put us. She said yes initially, but after we experienced silence from her. And we just knew they were angry and disappointed. We told them our door is always open for a conversation but she didn't see the use since 'our mind was made up'. So after a conversation with my parents, we gave her an 'out'. We told her she doesn't have to be godmother if she doesn't want to be. We want her, but only if she wants to. She came back on her decision. She doesn't want to be godmother. She rejected my unborn baby because of a name.\n\nIt's bad. Something has been broken. She can't talk to me, the little contact we have is through text. She feels ridiculized by our choice. I feel she puts rules and restrictions on me, that she herself does not need to follow. If she doesn't have to consult me in advance, then why should I ask for permission? I feel like everything she told me a year ago is bullshit now when she is on the other end of the story... We are nervous wrecks in a time we really just want to enjoy the pregnancy. My grandfather would be completely devastated if he knew this would drive us apart... He only had 2 grandkids. \n\nSo, obviously mistakes have been made. I'm still in love with the name we chose and wouldn't change it for the world.

His name is not a mistake. That name and relationship has been in your heart for so long - it\u2019s only right that your baby carries it. \n\nThere are so many people in this world that share the exact same name, especially if it\u2019s a pretty common name (ex. Sam). I think it\u2019s special and kind of cool that the cousins have the same name. It could become a sweet family story. \n\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem like your sister has such a positive view. \n\nI say this because not only did she know how you feel about your godfather & has been aware that you and your gf held that name close. \n\nThat to me sounds like she \u201cstole\u201d the name. Rather than fess up - she is putting it all on you, (maybe to distract from her own guilt ?). First she was mad about your reaction , then it\u2019s because you weren\u2019t as supportive as she wanted\u2026seems like she is picking at things to hold against you. \nI also find it weird and inconsiderate for giving you parameters on what to name YOUR child that she obviously didn\u2019t follow herself. THEN to decline being the godmother??  \n\nExcuse me if this is overstepping / reaching but has she always been this reactive? Bossy?  \n\nIf this is not typical behavior I would maybe look into it further. Could be signs of depression manifesting itself as anger towards you? It may sound wild but if this is out of the ordinary - there may be something else. \n\nIf this is typically how she is - how would you normally go about smoothing out intense moments with her?  Does speaking to your parents help? Like maybe they can speak to her? Or another family member that is close to both of you could maybe mediate? \n\nI hope you and your gf can still enjoy this pregnancy. It may seem impossible right now because you are both stressed but I want you to try your best to make it happy. Your sister may be trying to dampen this special time but don\u2019t let her. You and your gf are in love and are about to be parents!! Try your best to focus on the exciting parts because they are there \ud83e\udd70", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s 2 Sams which is not a big deal. Just sounds like family lacks communication.", "Warn you for what? You all weren\u2019t even pregnant at the time. What if you all never got pregnant?", "That's spot on. There is no communication. And that's exactly what we tried to change by including them early on.", "Warn me for the name choice. Warn me so I'm prepared before she gives birth. Warn me so I can adjust to the fact she used my godfathers name, the most important man in my life whom I miss every single day. Nothing more, just a little consideration.\n\nDoesn't even matter wether or not I get a kid next...", "I was first at ESH until I saw your reaction to other people's opinions.  You only came here for validation which means YTA.  You need to grow up and become more mature before the baby comes because being a parent can be an emotional rollercoaster you can't freak out on during minor hills and turns while you're riding it.", "YTA\n\nWhy would you give your kid the same name as their first cousin? I understand your disappointment when your sister used it first, especially if she knew you wanted it. Anger there at that moment was fully justified if she did that knowingly. But that\u2019s what happened and you\u2019ve had plenty of time to come up with a new name. You\u2019re just using your kid\u2019s name to pick a fight now.\n\nLuckily you still have time to change your mind. I sincerely hope you do. This is pretty ridiculous.", "ESH. Neither of you own the name, you can name them whatever you want. There can be 2, 3, 9 sams in the family", "NTA. Your sister knew you were going to use the name, chose it anyway, didn't tell you ahead of time, then after the baby comes she tells you she's using the name and asks if you're bummed about it. She KNEW how you'd react and did it deliberately, then held the reaction she knew you'd have against you. Good for you on using the name you wanted to. She really shouldn't be surprised or upset by it, especially since you at least had the courtesy to tell her ahead of time.", "Nta", "YTA\n\nYour sister had every right to name her child what she wanted- your child wasn\u2019t even conceived. First come, first served. Emotional response or not, as the mother of a premature baby, you\u2019re lucky she forgave you. I really hope you never have to go through something similar. \n\nHowever, you\u2019re clearly not over it. So not over it that despite there being an actual living existing Sam- your nephew- you are are choosing to give his cousin the same name. That\u2019s not nice uncle behaviour. This is not the same as your hypothetical child having their name \u2018stolen\u2019, you\u2019re doing it to your nephew. And you say refusing to be Godmother is taking it out on your child- you\u2019re deciding that your nephew has to be known as a nickname from now onwards. \n\nYou\u2019re not doing this to your sister, you\u2019re doing this to your nephew, who you\u2019ve already disregarded previously, and I fully understand why his mother is struggling with that.", "The old fashioned rule stated that the first son was named after the father of the father, and the second son after the father of the mother. Unless the maternal grandfather was deceased when son nr 1 was born while the paternal grandfather still lived, because the dead had priority. So my parents came from families of respectively 9 and 10. And each of my fathers brothers would call his first born son (or second born son) 'Sam' - to stay in OPs story. \n\nThe naming rules went on and on, and my father recounted how his father received a lot of backlash for not following the rules on nr 10. So my father decided to ditch the rules on son nr 3 - without backlash ;). \n\nOP: NTA for following this time-honored tradition \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d.", "My mother and her sisters are all Maria because my grandparents had a deal where all girls were named after my abuelita and all boys would be Jorge after my abuelito. They ended up having only girls, so to honor him, all the girls named a son after him. I and three of my cousins are Jorge. All of us go by our middle names (my first middle name in my case because I have 3 and it happens to be my Paternal grandfather's name along with two uncles on his side)", "You're a hypocrite for your reactions, not the name. Stay on track YTA", "Agree with this. \n\nI have a cousin name *Harold, a nephew name *Harold & my son's name *Harold too. When we're all together, they are Old Harold, Young Harold and Baby Harold lol", "Dude my family is full to the brim of Roberts and Johns. There's John Robert, Robert John, there's Bobby and Bobby-John, and John and John-John, and Uncle Bob and Uncle Bob (who is the uncle of Uncle Bob). It really doesn't make a difference.", "This!! Problem solved!!", "My family has 3 people named John, so they get to be Brother John (Dad's brother), John (aunt's husband), and Young John/Johnny (aunt's son). Easy enough to differentiate.", ">We were very happy for her but very sad about the name She texted me saying: \"you're probably pretty bummed out right now, aren't you?\"\n\nWait, so this didn't even come up until she brought it up, meaning she knew exactly what she was doing and how you'd probably feel about it?  That feels like a firm NTA then, even if things weren't handled perfectly on your end.", "I read your other comment and saw that you tried to be diplomatic and rerouted back to your sister's premie, but your sister was adamant on focusing on your feelings about the baby's name. And when you finally gave in and answered her (followed immediately by rerouting back to her baby and her needs again), she only wanted to focus on your (bad) answer and shut down.\n\n\nI'm going to be downvoted for this, but it sounds like you did your best, OP. AITA has many cases of, \"if you keep pushing for an answer, don't be surprised to hear something you don't like.\"  Well, your sister pushed and pushed and wouldn't let up. She knew you were upset about her using your grandfather's name. You could have lied, but then your sister would have been upset about you lying. She set you up then got upset when you gave her what she wanted.  I don't know if she did it intentionally or if it was her subconscious' way to redirect her stress and find someone else to lash out at. Either way, you can stop apologizing to her for that incident.\n\n\nRegarding this most recent incident, I admit, I had a bad feeling the moment you said you wanted your sister as your baby's godmother. But what's done is done. If you feel like it, let your sister know you'd like to chat with her when she's ready, but give your sister some space to cool off and process. In the meantime, maybe stop with the doom and gloom and just enjoy your pregnancy.", "I really really appreciate this comment. Thanks a lot. I feel understood by you. And that's rare, especially on Reddit.", "And it\u2019s also her grandfather. This whole thing sounds exhausting. ESH although you a bit more for getting upset about a hypothetical child versus her being upset about her actual child."]}
