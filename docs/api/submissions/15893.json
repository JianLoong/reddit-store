{"id": 15893, "submission_id": "131nvpz", "title": "AITA for naming my baby?", "selftext": "A year ago, my (34m) sister (33f) had her 3rd baby. She named him after our late grandfather, who is my godfather. Let's call him Sam. \n\nWe love the kid very much, but my gf and me were sitting on that name as well for our first child. My sister knew this. She didn't talk to us beforehand, but just dropped the name on us when she just gave birth. On the phone. \n\nI had an emotional reaction. I felt like she didn't respect me enough to talk things through or at least give me fair warning in advance. Things kind of escalated from there. We got over it relatively quick but now my sister is angry because she blames me for not being there for her in a difficult time (the baby was premature). I really tried to be, but she kind of shut down every attempt at conversation. She said she has every right to pick that name, that she didn't steal anything from us, that choosing a name is 100% the choice of the parents... \n\nIt took months but after a lot of effort we got things back to normal. Flash forward to autumn 2022, me and my gf get pregnant.\n\nWe have been discussing the name for a very long time. We considered a lot of options, but our harts just kept on saying it has to be Sam. It's a name that holds so much emotion, we have built the idea of having children together around this name. Our kid has always been Sam in our heads. We knew that my sister was going to have a hard time with it but we made the call to name our kid Sam, because otherwise we would have regretted our choice forever. \n\nWe wanted my sister to be the godmother, so about a 2 months ago we popped her the question. Of course, we also told her the name we chose. We didn't want to put her in the same position that she put us. She said yes initially, but after we experienced silence from her. And we just knew they were angry and disappointed. We told them our door is always open for a conversation but she didn't see the use since 'our mind was made up'. So after a conversation with my parents, we gave her an 'out'. We told her she doesn't have to be godmother if she doesn't want to be. We want her, but only if she wants to. She came back on her decision. She doesn't want to be godmother. She rejected my unborn baby because of a name.\n\nIt's bad. Something has been broken. She can't talk to me, the little contact we have is through text. She feels ridiculized by our choice. I feel she puts rules and restrictions on me, that she herself does not need to follow. If she doesn't have to consult me in advance, then why should I ask for permission? I feel like everything she told me a year ago is bullshit now when she is on the other end of the story... We are nervous wrecks in a time we really just want to enjoy the pregnancy. My grandfather would be completely devastated if he knew this would drive us apart... He only had 2 grandkids. \n\nSo, obviously mistakes have been made. I'm still in love with the name we chose and wouldn't change it for the world. But...\n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1682677969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131nvpz/aita_for_naming_my_baby/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a lot of unspoken inappropriate expectations and your sister is acting like she owns a name. \n\nThe way to play this would have been hearing your sister's baby name and saying, \"wow, that's great, it'll be fun having two Sams in the family\" and then proceeding.", "You both are kinda TA fir acting like you own this name.

I think if you've had your heart set on that name for a long time, and your sister knew that but then named her child that name without even talking to you about it first, she has no right to demand that you adhere to her own rules that she's set for you but doesn't follow. Sure you can say that naming a baby is a \"first come first serve\" thing, but in reality she knew how much you wanted to name your baby that. To name her baby that without checking you were OK with it but then being mad at you for following through with the name plans, that's just silly.\n\n\nYou could argue that for the sake of family it'd be worth naming the baby's middle name Sam and first name something else, but that depends on you and your girlfriend's feelings.

Sending love to you and your little family. \ud83d\udc96\n\nYou are NTA although I\u2019m thinking your sister may be. \n\nBefore I get into my thoughts I want to show my support and reaffirm your decision to name YOUR child after your godfather. His name is not a mistake. That name and relationship has been in your heart for so long - it\u2019s only right that your baby carries it. \n\nThere are so many people in this world that share the exact same name, especially if it\u2019s a pretty common name (ex. Sam). I think it\u2019s special and kind of cool that the cousins have the same name. It could become a sweet family story. \n\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem like your sister has such a positive view. \n\nI say this because not only did she know how you feel about your godfather & has been aware that you and your gf held that name close. \n\nThat to me sounds like she \u201cstole\u201d the name. Rather than fess up - she is putting it all on you, (maybe to distract from her own guilt ?). First she was mad about your reaction , then it\u2019s because you weren\u2019t as supportive as she wanted\u2026seems like she is picking at things to hold against you. \nI also find it weird and inconsiderate for giving you parameters on what to name YOUR child that she obviously didn\u2019t follow herself. THEN to decline being the godmother??  \n\nExcuse me if this is overstepping / reaching but has she always been this reactive? Bossy?  \n\nIf this is not typical behavior I would maybe look into it further. Could be signs of depression manifesting itself as anger towards you? It may sound wild but if this is out of the ordinary - there may be something else. \n\nIf this is typically how she is - how would you normally go about smoothing out intense moments with her?  Does speaking to your parents help? Like maybe they can speak to her? Or another family member that is close to both of you could maybe mediate? \n\nI hope you and your gf can still enjoy this pregnancy. It may seem impossible right now because you are both stressed but I want you to try your best to make it happy. Your sister may be trying to dampen this special time but don\u2019t let her. You and your gf are in love and are about to be parents!! Try your best to focus on the exciting parts because they are there \ud83e\udd70", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
