We worked out a plan where within the next year then he\u2019d pay me back slowly when he could and eventually I\u2019d get all my money back. This plan was thoroughly thought out, we looked at his salary and considered bills and it should have been doable in  approximately a year, give or take.\n\nHe followed the plan for the first two payments and then I slowly stopped getting money. He\u2019d start to pay me less, then not at all, all with some excuses. I dealt with it fine at first cause I understand things come up and obviously he wouldn\u2019t be able to follow our hypothetical payment plan to the T. But then his reasons for not being able to pay me became clear bullshit excuses, others even agreeing on that.\n\nOver the course of three years he\u2019s paid probably a tenth of what he owes me at most. I\u2019ve made up the difference of my loss by me working over these years but I would be significantly richer if he paid me like promised or even tried.\n\nMy brother isn\u2019t living a poor lifestyle either. He affords everything he needs and what he wants now. \n\nA couple weeks back my dog got severely ill. She was old but not old enough to be on death\u2019s door. I couldn\u2019t afford to pay to help my dog and to avoid having her in pain ultimately I had to put my dog down.\n\nAround the same time I had to put my dog down my brother sent out invites to his wedding which is coming up in a few weeks. I\u2019m not over my dog\u2019s death yet and frankly if my brother had been paying me anything at all I could have afforded to help my dog.\n\nI didn\u2019t respond to the invite yet and I\u2019ll miss the deadline soon and my family has asked why. I said that I don\u2019t know if I want to attend and said why. \n\nThey think I\u2019m an asshole for this and I\u2019m not denying I\u2019m definitely blinded by rash emotions right now so I dunno. \n\nAITA?

I feel terrible for OP, losing a dog can be SO hard, but he\u2019s definitely shifting blame, I think deep down he knows that he should have put money away and he didn\u2019t.

The vet had just told me what my dog needed", "I think the discussion with the brother needs to be separate from the dog for this reason; there's no absolute guarantee the treatment would have saved the dog's life and bringing that up to bolster the argument for getting paid back will likely derail the conversation into 'oh, your dog matters more than your own brother?'", "There's no such thing as 100% guarantees for medical procedures, whether for dogs or humans.", "Do you have documentation?

A typical vet visit is $50, but you wouldn't claim for those since the 'out of pocket' cost for any claim is $100.", "A lot of the pet insurance companies also require you to pay for services up front, then send them the bill and they reimburse a percentage of it, if it qualifies, which I think is why more people don't have pet insurance.", "It\u2019s the opposite in my region.
