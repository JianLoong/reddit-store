We come from nearly every corner of the globe, our ages range from 13 to 80+, and our life experiences shape the feedback that we give to OPs on their posts. There have been times when I came across a comment so well thought out and well written that it managed to completely change how I was viewing the overall situation. I\u2019ve read some comments on the sub that have helped me to grow as a human being, and I will forever be grateful for the users who took the time to make those contributions.\n\nFor this category, we want to know what comments you found the most persuasive. Did they change how you voted? Did they change how you viewed the conflict OP was experiencing? Did they change how you saw the world? If so, nominate them here!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nTo enter your nomination, make a top-level comment here with the link to the comment you are nominating. To vote on your favorite, upvote the top-level comment that contains the link. Contest mode will stay on for the entire 2 weeks to keep things as fair as possible, so make sure that you pay attention and read through the comments so you\u2019re not making a duplicate nomination.\n\nAt the end of 2 weeks the thread will be locked and contest mode will be turned off.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Keep things civil.
