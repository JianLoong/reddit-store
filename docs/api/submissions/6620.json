Whether or not it ultimately worked to persuade the mother, it did a great job of breaking down every step that was wrong. Even if the mother remains defensive, hopefully something of that sticks with her long term.", "Really?  That didn't persuade me of anything.  In fact, reading it I came away wondering if we read the same thing.", "I think they made an excellent point of hearing the OP while offering advice for a tough time. Excellent nomination", "It was very empathetic one way.  It wasn't really empathetic to OP, who is 16 years old.

Saying \"you can help, but you don't have to\" is not guilt tripping.\n\nGuilt tripping would be something like \"Your sister is struggling but you don't care enough to help\" or \"your parents are working so hard to support you and your sister, don't they deserve your support as well?\"\n\nThe fact is that helping others can be a deeply rewarding experience, but all the joy is sucked out if we feel forced into it.\n\nThe OP was feeling forced into helping and this was making them not want to help at all.

For some reason, probably because of who you are, she trusts you. She trusts you enough to come to you when she feels overwhelmed, she also trusts you enough to be her vulnerable, currently-damaged self in front of you. Honestly, that's bigger than you may realize. I've struggled with so many clients, your step-sister's age, to get them to a point where they can go to close family and friends for support. Many survivors cut themselves off, become withdrawn and deeply depressed, and it's a downward spiral from there.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Again, you aren't responsible for your step-sister's healing and recovery but you're obviously a nice enough person that she turns to you.

It asked\n\n>Is it possible to compromise in some way, for her benefit, the sake of family relationships, and to find a middle-ground where YOU feel comfortable and not over-burdened with her recovery?\n\nAnd the OP can reasonably answer \"No. A compromise isn't possible\"\n\nIt could have persuaded the OP to consider the possibility of still providing some support, but the OP might have just determined it was impossible especially since the OP's parents didn't seem willing to respect the OPs boundaries.", "There is also another vocal contingent on this sub that is aggressively self-sacrificing and deem any action other than bending over backwards for anyone and everyone to be assholishly selfish.

Yeah, re-reading the comment I think you have a point.^(1) In particular this:\n\n>You have the choice to push her away or play a small role in her healing process.\n\nShould have been phrased much more neutrally.\n\nI do think there should be room for greyness in the judgements on this site, and I do think it can be worthwhile to help OPs consider options other than \"cut them off, no compromise\" but you are right that the comment failed to fully respect the OPs right to refuse.\n\nI will say though that I think the commenter might have had purer intentions and just was indelicate in their phrasing. The guilt tripping may have been accidental rather than calculated.\n\n^(1: Most persuasive comment right here)", "I was cringing just reading it & felt so sorry for the OP. This girl is a stranger& can\u2019t be left alone but her parents can\u2019t be bothered to care for her so poor OP has to do what they refuse. It\u2019s awful.", "As someone who speaks emotional manipulation fluently, the whole comment made me really uncomfortable. It minimized the burden on OP, and didn\u2019t give any practical tips on how to deal with the behavior.\n\nThe commenter is experienced as a trauma therapist and I think was focused on the girl.", "What a mean bunch of nitpickers", "Same. \n\nAlso, yes the OP is 16 and not an adult, but when you are on the pathway to being an adult (eg when 16yo) it requires taking small steps towards whatever actions and behaviours an adult might do. In this example, it could be to sit with someone in a neutral space (not OPs\u2019s room) and just be with them. This is a kind thing to do to help his stepsister. It\u2019s a small action, and not overly a burden. The commenter even suggested being \u201calone together\u201d for christs sake! Watching YouTube or reading a book in the same room she is in. \n\nPeople saying this is a HUGE burden on the 16yo are ridiculous.", "This is a thing that kinda broke my mind. Realizing that the thousands on thousands of people on Reddit feel very little obligation toward the people around them, be it family, friends or work relationships. Listen to these people talk about family stuff- Yeah. Um. You help a person having a nervous breakdown because you do. Your step sister is sobbing and you\u2019re uncomfortable? If you can\u2019t even manage, \u201cHey- what\u2019s wrong?\u201d at *sixteen*, you *should* be uncomfortable. It means there\u2019s something *wrong* with you. Sorry folks. Bitter Grocery was Emotional Support Eldest Daughter. I don\u2019t know how to think any other way. Not sure I would if anyone could teach me. It\u2019s never a bad thing to assist a person in trouble. The lack of desire to do so is\u2026 jeez, something they should probably screen for now considering the state of the world. And I don\u2019t think this should have been on OP to *fix*, but his complete shut out of a person in obvious immediate distress is\u2026 distressing to me.", "Except that comment didn't say that at all? It said OP bore 0 responsibility multiple times but there was an opportunity to do something kind for someone else. That's not the same as \"if you don't do X you are assholishly selfish\".", "Correct!!! If that was my son I\u2019d be appalled. Your stepsister has been through something traumatic, she knocks on your door and you say \u201cI\u2019m busy\u201d. \n\nI get that he may need to study and have his own space or whatever, but honestly she wasn\u2019t asking for much. She has parents and a therapist, she wasn\u2019t asking much of him at all. \n\nHis response is pathetic as a 16yo imho and I\u2019d be talking to him about how he responds to others when they ask anything of him, it makes him uncomfortable, and \u2026 therefore he doesn\u2019t want to ever empathize or find a way to help or compromise or see a different perspective?? How is this learning life skills, negotiation, getting along with others, living in a society?! Wtf", "I agree.  \n\nAs a previously 16 yr old boy..\n\nI can absolutely understand the lack of desire to let your younger sister randomly come into your room and bug you. In fact, there were clear rules about when and how I could enter my brother's rooms.\n\nAnd I recognize that the people with the most fervor... Have had to deal with extremes of these situations that I havent, and that op probably hasn't. And in those situations, for safety, yes. You have no obligation.\n\nBut there's something between obligation and caretaker.  There's color in between black and white. And we like clean, clear YTA or NTA answers here.. because they're clean.\n\nBut dammit, that's not really how this shit works in the real world.  So, have some fucking empathy for those around you. And if it gets overwhelming (which it sounds like in the og thread) then get help.. as he was trying to do, if poorly because.. 16 yr old boy.", "\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 I was actually waiting for the roasting to begin. I\u2019ve got some strong opinions on responsibility and family- but I was raised by my old school Scottish grandmother and then parentified by my drunk mother and step dad after my grandmother passed away bc they couldn\u2019t deal with the two kids under three they had for the ten years that followed.", "Short-Ad-9388 had a powerful comment on action and meaning with such empathy in a difficult situation.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzo4ph/comment/j2crnid/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "Except that's not what was said at all.  That comment was loaded with guilt tripping and manipulation.\n\nThe problem is too many of you are telling this 16 year old he supposed to be his stepsister's emotional support animal and be there whenever she demands it. This wasn't a one time thing, this was him being constantly expected to be her emotional support animal for months, and it's disgusting. That is the job of a mental health professional, not a 16 year old high school kid.", "I totally agree. And I really doubt they are like that on real life. \nWe all must do stuff we don't want to do, support friends/family in bad situation when we rather be doing other stuff, say or act a certain way when we don't want to, or put up with certain people sporadically when we must to avoid a bigger conflict.\n\nIt's called life.", "I wouldn't say they are self-sacrificing, I would say they are other-sacrificing. I'm willing to bet they would have a very different opinion if they were the ones who were expected to never be able to have a moment to themselves, and have to open the door and let this girl in at literally any time she demands it. And that had apparently been going on for months. I wouldn't expect a fully grown adult to be able to cope with that, never mind a 16 year old high school kid.", "That\u2019s the thing about that post is OP\u2019s age. She herself is 16 a teenager presumably with her own issues she\u2019s not at the age or emotional maturity to be anyone\u2019s \u201csafe person\u201d \n\nThankfully the stepsister is therapy but putting that burden on a 16 year old is too much", "Except they weren't saying that? I would agree with you if the girl in the post didn't had a therapist and support. She does, but she doesn't want to be alone and OP could be empathic to people and do a kindness. \nHe doesn't live there. We are literally talking about a few hours every other weekend.", "I'm realizing more-and-more that current culture breeds personal comfort and anything that is uncomfortable is deemed toxic, unhealthy, abusive, manipulative etc and should be cut-out immediately or deemed \"not my responsibility\". \n\nBut love IS responsibility. To hold a relationship with someone is not to be responsable of the person per-say, but to be responsible to the relationship.  When we say we accept people and willing to hold any form of relationship, we are suppose to accept people when they need it the most - and it's not always pretty.\n\nWe are human. We make mistakes. And what if someone is toxic, abusive etc? You can make a choice in either being there for them and be firm, or not. But then don't come crying when you yourself are also \"toxic\" and no one is there for you to understand and help learn new ways. We have misconstrued what actually toxic, abuse etc means to describe when we are uncomfortable when facing other human beings with human emotions and experiences.\n\nI'm making broad statements here, but I also think it's not a coincidence that more and more research proves how younger generations are struggling to hold meaningful relationships.", "Yeah no.  That comment was so full of guilt-tripping that I consider it outright evil.\n\n> That's not the same as \"if you don't do X you are assholishly selfish\".\n\nThat's exactly what that post was, just in more weaselish language.", ">his complete shut out of a person in obvious immediate distress is\u2026 distressing to me.\n\nYeah, when I read the responses to that advice I thought I'd entered some sort of bizarro world. When a trauma occurs it doesn't just happen to that individual. To carrying degrees it affects everyone around them too. That's the long and short of it. I dunno what this particular trauma was, but I can't imagine, for instance, locking a SA survivor out of my room while they were breaking down in panic, even if a were a punk 16yo. Yeah, it's a big ask to be available, even as just a silent presence, but it's something that we do because it's the decent and humane thing to do.\n\nI feel like the reddit advice hiveminds have become desensitized to the concepts of familial and household obligations because we're constantly exposed to stories of it being weaponized by shitty, narcissistic parents.", "Since it seems like I see \u201cNC/LC\u201d on an almost daily basis now, I agree with a lot what you say. It\u2019s like people are looking for any excuse to cut people out of their lives. \n\nBut, I get why, and I think your second paragraph sheds light on this phenomenon: the truth is, we don\u2019t love as many people as we\u2019re supposed to. I don\u2019t love most of my family members. They haven\u2019t done anything overtly terrible to me that would justify a \u201clack of love\u201d in a social context that assumes we all love our family members just because they\u2019re family.  So when family obligations and events roll around I\u2019m left feeling inconvenienced and pressured, and I struggle to understand why I\u2019m supposed to buy a bus ticket and make the 4-hour trip to stay in a cramped house with people I don\u2019t feel much for. And why I should do that three or four times over just the Christmas holidays so that I can see all sides of my family and partner\u2019s family. \n\nThere\u2019s so much to do, we\u2019re all busy and so scattered, and there\u2019s so much to worry about, that I can understand the desire to narrow one\u2019s circle. I have maybe 8 people I really care about and another 25 I\u2019m expected to care about but I\u2019d probably go mad if I actually did. \n\nBut, to your last point, I do think we\u2019re losing something. Something that we gain from navigating a complex social/family network, from meeting our cousins\u2019 new partners, from maintaining and evolving relationships over decades, and from learning to maintain bonds despite adversity. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the answer is for the rest of us, but I dont think that guilting a 16yo kid into supporting his step-sister through episodes that seem ongoing over a long period of time at the expense of his own mental health and privacy is the right answer for him.", "I agree, this young person is not capable of handling their step sisters trauma. The thing that came to mind for me was that if she was an SA victim then she could act out some seriously questionable things as she tries to process and rationalise what happened to her.\n\nAs a biologically unrelated male he could have become the safe proxy for her attacker who she is trying to gain control over in her mind to make him be kind \u201cthis time\u201d instead of hurt her. This is a dangerous situation for the OP. She could be trying to drown the bad memories with safe ones where she is in control, but this is affecting him and making him feel unsafe.\n\nSomeone genuinely qualified to deal with psychological trauma would know this reason for her choosing him is a possibility and not encourage the OP to do something that makes them feel so uncomfortable. \nHe probably felt uncomfortable for a reason and that should not be ignored.", "I'm no stranger to emotional manipulation. My mom would tell me all the time if I didn't do what she wanted she would die early because of my ingratitude and my father would not take care of me and I'd be alone in the world, among other things. \n\nThis comment is very far from being manipulative. The OP is not the only person whose welfare we must consider, and this commenter made an effort to show some reasonable, concrete compromises they could do:\n\n>Is it possible to compromise in some way, for her benefit, the sake of family relationships, and to find a middle-ground where YOU feel comfortable and not over-burdened with her recovery?\n>\n>Perhaps if your parents go out somewhere and she's to be left alone, they talk to you first and you guys agree on the when and for how long (as if you were arranging to babysit younger siblings).\n\nSetting boundaries around how much time he's expected to support her is very much the opposite of turning him into an emotional support animal. \n\nRespectfully, much of the need for mental health professionals is caused by abusive family, but it is also caused by _neglectful_ family. Expecting mental health professionals to solve all trauma is also expecting too much of them! Nobody heals properly without a support network and it is _not_ manipulative to point out that truth.", "So fascinating that what you got and I got out of that comment. I read privilege bc it completely ignores all the self-taught in the black community who couldn\u2019t afford professionals. Growing up, I watch my black friends practice and support each other on an empty football field - sometimes there was a cardboard mat, other times there weren\u2019t, but they figured out how to learn safely and how to best support each other without getting hurt. Little Humans are amazing at learning physicality. And most of us learned quite a bit from being latchkey and without the privilege of a paid professional. In the black community, the grand-mom from the OP would have been their \u201cprofessional\u201d and they\u2019d be proud of said professional.", "Yeah I think it's actually fine for the sibling to choose to not support the stepsister, and the mom is being an AH by insisting on them unconditionally supporting the stepsister, but acting like SlvrMoon_owl's comment is pure evil is ridiculous. People just love projecting their own bullshit onto everything. I think people are conveniently forgetting that it's harder being the victim of a traumatic event than supporting said victim through a traumatic event.", "You have to wonder also just how many of these people would be pissed off if one of their friends refused to help them when asked...", "I think verb \"guilting\" is where the division is. I don't interpret the original comment as encouraging the OP to set himself on fire to keep the step-sister warm, and I'm really not sure why so many people seem to do so.", "Same here, I thought this was a really thoughtful solution in the face of such delicate circumstances.", "same here it's borderline nonsensical. almost everything in her list is a reach or a rephrase of something she already said"]}
