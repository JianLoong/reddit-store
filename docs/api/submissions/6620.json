We come from nearly every corner of the globe, our ages range from 13 to 80+, and our life experiences shape the feedback that we give to OPs on their posts. There have been times when I came across a comment so well thought out and well written that it managed to completely change how I was viewing the overall situation. I\u2019ve read some comments on the sub that have helped me to grow as a human being, and I will forever be grateful for the users who took the time to make those contributions.\n\nFor this category, we want to know what comments you found the most persuasive. Did they change how you voted? Did they change how you viewed the conflict OP was experiencing? Did they change how you saw the world? If so, nominate them here!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nTo enter your nomination, make a top-level comment here with the link to the comment you are nominating.

Whether or not it ultimately worked to persuade the mother, it did a great job of breaking down every step that was wrong. Even if the mother remains defensive, hopefully something of that sticks with her long term.", "Really?  That didn't persuade me of anything.  In fact, reading it I came away wondering if we read the same thing.", "I think they made an excellent point of hearing the OP while offering advice for a tough time. Excellent nomination", "It was very empathetic one way.  It wasn't really empathetic to OP, who is 16 years old.  It really did try to guilt trip him into just letting her use him for her own theraputic needs", "super empathetic to try and guilt trip a 16yo kid into being his stepsibling's emotional support animal. /s \ud83d\ude2c", "OP\u2019s edit of course is just \u201cI\u2019m leaving my dad\u2019s house and not coming back.\u201d So seems like it wasn\u2019t persuasive to OP, sadly.", "Man I was blown away when I read the responses to that comment.

It\u2019s sad, honestly.", "I think you are misreading the comment. Saying \"you can help, but you don't have to\" is not guilt tripping.\n\nGuilt tripping would be something like \"Your sister is struggling but you don't care enough to help\" or \"your parents are working so hard to support you and your sister, don't they deserve your support as well?\"\n\nThe fact is that helping others can be a deeply rewarding experience, but all the joy is sucked out if we feel forced into it.\n\nThe OP was feeling forced into helping and this was making them not want to help at all. The commenter was trying to validate that the OP shouldn't feel obliged to help, while still leaving the door open for the OP to help if they wanted to.", "Right.", "> You may not feel comfortable around your step-sister but to her, you represent safety and comfort. For some reason, probably because of who you are, she trusts you. She trusts you enough to come to you when she feels overwhelmed, she also trusts you enough to be her vulnerable, currently-damaged self in front of you. Honestly, that's bigger than you may realize. I've struggled with so many clients, your step-sister's age, to get them to a point where they can go to close family and friends for support. Many survivors cut themselves off, become withdrawn and deeply depressed, and it's a downward spiral from there.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Again, you aren't responsible for your step-sister's healing and recovery but you're obviously a nice enough person that she turns to you. You have the choice to push her away or play a small role in her healing process.\n\nsorry to disagree, but in my opinion these examples from the linked comment is a lot of loaded language. language that i wouldn't put on anybody, much less a teenager who's already explained how uncomfortable he feels being put in that position.", "I'm nominating [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tztp48/aita_for_telling_mil_if_she_cant_bond_with_my/i41zlr6?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) because of the discussion in the thread of whether it was normal child's play or not.", "\n[Automod of post for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tztp48/aita_for_telling_mil_if_she_cant_bond_with_my/i4197gm?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)", ">So seems like it wasn\u2019t persuasive to OP, sadly.\n\nThe point recognized that it was the OPs choice. It asked\n\n>Is it possible to compromise in some way, for her benefit, the sake of family relationships, and to find a middle-ground where YOU feel comfortable and not over-burdened with her recovery?\n\nAnd the OP can reasonably answer \"No. A compromise isn't possible\"\n\nIt could have persuaded the OP to consider the possibility of still providing some support, but the OP might have just determined it was impossible especially since the OP's parents didn't seem willing to respect the OPs boundaries.", "There is also another vocal contingent on this sub that is aggressively self-sacrificing and deem any action other than bending over backwards for anyone and everyone to be assholishly selfish. It's sad, honestly.\n\nA 16-year old should not have to be their stepsibling's therapist/emotional support/trauma dumpster.", "That is a fair argument. Yeah, re-reading the comment I think you have a point.^(1) In particular this:\n\n>You have the choice to push her away or play a small role in her healing process.\n\nShould have been phrased much more neutrally.\n\nI do think there should be room for greyness in the judgements on this site, and I do think it can be worthwhile to help OPs consider options other than \"cut them off, no compromise\" but you are right that the comment failed to fully respect the OPs right to refuse.\n\nI will say though that I think the commenter might have had purer intentions and just was indelicate in their phrasing. The guilt tripping may have been accidental rather than calculated.\n\n^(1: Most persuasive comment right here)", "I was cringing just reading it & felt so sorry for the OP. This girl is a stranger& can\u2019t be left alone but her parents can\u2019t be bothered to care for her so poor OP has to do what they refuse. It\u2019s awful.", "As someone who speaks emotional manipulation fluently, the whole comment made me really uncomfortable. It minimized the burden on OP, and didn\u2019t give any practical tips on how to deal with the behavior.\n\nThe commenter is experienced as a trauma therapist and I think was focused on the girl.", "What a mean bunch of nitpickers", "Same. \n\nAlso, yes the OP is 16 and not an adult, but when you are on the pathway to being an adult (eg when 16yo) it requires taking small steps towards whatever actions and behaviours an adult might do. In this example, it could be to sit with someone in a neutral space (not OPs\u2019s room) and just be with them. This is a kind thing to do to help his stepsister. It\u2019s a small action, and not overly a burden. The commenter even suggested being \u201calone together\u201d for christs sake! Watching YouTube or reading a book in the same room she is in. \n\nPeople saying this is a HUGE burden on the 16yo are ridiculous.", "This is a thing that kinda broke my mind. Realizing that the thousands on thousands of people on Reddit feel very little obligation toward the people around them, be it family, friends or work relationships. Listen to these people talk about family stuff- Yeah. Um. You help a person having a nervous breakdown because you do. Your step sister is sobbing and you\u2019re uncomfortable? If you can\u2019t even manage, \u201cHey- what\u2019s wrong?\u201d at *sixteen*, you *should* be uncomfortable. It means there\u2019s something *wrong* with you. Sorry folks. Bitter Grocery was Emotional Support Eldest Daughter. I don\u2019t know how to think any other way. Not sure I would if anyone could teach me. It\u2019s never a bad thing to assist a person in trouble. The lack of desire to do so is\u2026 jeez, something they should probably screen for now considering the state of the world. And I don\u2019t think this should have been on OP to *fix*, but his complete shut out of a person in obvious immediate distress is\u2026 distressing to me.", "Except that comment didn't say that at all? It said OP bore 0 responsibility multiple times but there was an opportunity to do something kind for someone else. That's not the same as \"if you don't do X you are assholishly selfish\".", "Correct!!! If that was my son I\u2019d be appalled. Your stepsister has been through something traumatic, she knocks on your door and you say \u201cI\u2019m busy\u201d. \n\nI get that he may need to study and have his own space or whatever, but honestly she wasn\u2019t asking for much. She has parents and a therapist, she wasn\u2019t asking much of him at all. \n\nHis response is pathetic as a 16yo imho and I\u2019d be talking to him about how he responds to others when they ask anything of him, it makes him uncomfortable, and \u2026 therefore he doesn\u2019t want to ever empathize or find a way to help or compromise or see a different perspective?? How is this learning life skills, negotiation, getting along with others, living in a society?! Wtf", "I agree.  \n\nAs a previously 16 yr old boy..\n\nI can absolutely understand the lack of desire to let your younger sister randomly come into your room and bug you. In fact, there were clear rules about when and how I could enter my brother's rooms.\n\nAnd I recognize that the people with the most fervor... Have had to deal with extremes of these situations that I havent, and that op probably hasn't. And in those situations, for safety, yes. You have no obligation.\n\nBut there's something between obligation and caretaker.  There's color in between black and white. And we like clean, clear YTA or NTA answers here.. because they're clean.\n\nBut dammit, that's not really how this shit works in the real world.  So, have some fucking empathy for those around you. And if it gets overwhelming (which it sounds like in the og thread) then get help.. as he was trying to do, if poorly because.. 16 yr old boy.", "\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 I was actually waiting for the roasting to begin. I\u2019ve got some strong opinions on responsibility and family- but I was raised by my old school Scottish grandmother and then parentified by my drunk mother and step dad after my grandmother passed away bc they couldn\u2019t deal with the two kids under three they had for the ten years that followed.", "Short-Ad-9388 had a powerful comment on action and meaning with such empathy in a difficult situation.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzo4ph/comment/j2crnid/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "Except that's not what was said at all. The problem is too many of you are telling this 16 year old he supposed to be his stepsister's emotional support animal and be there whenever she demands it. This wasn't a one time thing, this was him being constantly expected to be her emotional support animal for months, and it's disgusting. That is the job of a mental health professional, not a 16 year old high school kid."]}
