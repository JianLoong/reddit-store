I\u2019m fine with large dogs and dogs I trust, and wet grace a family dog, but I don\u2019t have to walk her so I don\u2019t need to meet other dogs, and she isn\u2019t allowed upstairs.\n\nI live in the uk, and row after school some days, and get the train home, which is what I did today. It\u2019s snowing/sleeting and -3 right now, and I\u2019m wearing sports gear (shorts and thick coat) so my legs were quite cold. I got to the station 15 minutes early and this is a small station with 1 line and 1 small shelter, so nowhere else to get out of the rain and no nearby shops. However, when I got there, there was a couple with a small happy Jack Russell who was trying to investigate everything while on a lead under the shelter. The all had coats and waterproof trousers, even the dog, and so I asked politely if they would mind moving out from the shelter so I could get warm because I have a phobia of dogs.\n\nThe man glared at me and said NO, we were here first fairly loudly, so I moved away because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable near the dog, but 3 of the 5 others under the shelter were glaring at them.\n\nWhen the train got there, I was really cold, so I made for the radiator seats (1 double and 1 4 seat per carriage are next to a radiator). I was sat in the double and they came in behind one of the ladies who had glared at them. They made a beeline for the 4 seat, but I stood up and said \u201cExcuse me, but can you move to a different carriage because I have a PHOBIA OF DOGS!\u201d The guy opened his mouth to respond but then the lady said \u201cAre you waiting for better weather\u201d.\n\nShe then sat down in the 4 seat and spread her bags around, so they left. The journey was fine, and I managed to calm down, but when we got off for the connection, they were both glaring at me, and the man said \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy!\u201d And now I feel bad bc I know they don\u2019t get a warm seat.

You don't ask someone to go out in the snow and sleet because YOU have a phobia. Your issues, your problem. You should be dressed for the weather - you could've changed into street clothes after your exercise. You also don't get to dictate where people sit on a public train.", "YTA\n\nThe dog wasn't behaving aggressively. You should have relocated yourself rather than asked people to relocate, either from beneath the shelter, or on the train, because of your phobia. The lady who spread her bags out all over three extra seats so no one else could sit down is also an AH.\n\nThe fact that they all had on appropriate clothes for the weather and you chose to wear summer shorts and a light shirt when it is snowing out is completely irrelevant. Next time, put on appropriate clothing before you leave the house.", "You don't ask other people to move.  You move yourself.\n\nSoft YTA", "YTA\n\nSo long as they weren\u2019t violating any rules by their dog\u2019s presence, your triggers and phobias are your responsibility to handle, and handling them doesn\u2019t involve asking people who are doing nothing wrong to leave the area.", "YTA.\n\nThe guy shouldn\u2019t have gotten loud with you, he is a bit of an AH for that.\n\nHowever OP, you suck for expecting strangers to accomodate you. If you have a phobia of dogs, why can\u2019t you move? Why couldn\u2019t you go to a different car on the train? Your phobia is not their problem. \n\nIf something makes you uncomfortable you remove yourself from the situation. You could\u2019ve moved to a different car.\n\nThe lady who took up 4 seats is also an AH because people who do that are just generally AHs", "YTA. \n\nYou are young, but should learn that others are not responsible for your feelings/fears. They had right to be there as well.", "YTA. I'm not sure who taught you that other people, including strangers, are responsible for accommodating your feelings and phobias, but they were wrong. You are responsible for them. I hope that you get some therapy for your phobia and learn how to manage your own feelings.", "YTA\n\nNothing you describe about this dog's behaviour or the way it was handled is inappropriate in any way. You will have to deal with the fact that some people have dogs and if need be you need to move. At the end of the day your phobia is your issue.\n\nUp until a few years ago I had a terrible phobia of thunderstorms. I would've loved to refuse to go outside during bad weather. No can do.", "\n>It\u2019s snowing/sleeting and -3 right now, and I\u2019m wearing sports gear (shorts and thick coat) so my legs were quite cold.\n\nYTA.

I very much doubt everyone else in the shelter glared at them as well.. \n\nYTA gotta deal with this. UK is extremely dog friendly. There's dogs everywhere.. the pub, the trains, the parks, everywhere. Will you make everyone move for you?", "Yeah, YTA. Not like in a big way, but if you can't even be in the same space as a small dog that is well-controlled, its a you problem. Assuming the dog is allowed on the public transit, then there's no reason that they should have to stand in the sleet so you don't have to. They also should have been able to sit in a different row from you to get warm in the seats.  It would have been kind and self-sacrificing if they had moved out to accomodate you, but you're the one asking for accomodation of your 'phobia.'\n\nConsider bringing a change of clothes and an umbrella/raincoat so you don't get caught in a similar situation in the future?", "YTA  if you go outside there will be dogs and even if you have a phobia the world should not have to accommodate for you. You can do formal therapy or informal with a friend's dog. But you should not have prevented someone from sitting in the radiator seats, you had the problem not them and it's public transportation", "YTA and a huge one. Your phobias are YOUR problems", "YTA - they reacted poorly, but you need to understand that the rest of the world doesn't have to change to make you feel \"comfortable\".  \n\nIt's completely unreasonable to ask anyone to wait out in the rain because you don't want to be around them.  It doesn't matter that they were all wearing raincoats.\n\nAnd your behavior on the train was completely unacceptable.  You don't get to demand that people sit somewhere else.  If it's that big of a problem, you need to remove yourself from the situation and not expect everyone else to accommodate you.", "YTA They were there first. You had a lot of nerve asking THEM to leave the shelter. If have you have a problem then YOU leave. As far as the train they, like you, have the right to sit where they like. Again if you have a problem with that then YOU leave. The world doesn't revolve around you. Get used to it.", "YTA - No one else is responsible for your fears/phobias/insecurities.  They have just as much aright to be where they were as you do.  The dog, in your own words \"small happy Jack Russell\", was not being aggressive.  Yet you wanted them to wait in the cold and rain/snow and sit in a different part of the train.  You could have easily gotten up and moved to someplace else without asking them to move.  I'd also recommend going through a therapy to get over your fear as you will encounter it all your life and can't expect others to change for your insecurities.", "YTA your triggers are yours, nobody else's. I hope you are getting help with that issue.", "you're entitled as fuck. You don't get special privileges because you're afraid of dogs, they were there first.\n\nYTA", "YTA - in public spaces, no one has to accommodate your insane fear of a tiny dog being slightly near you, nor should anyone have to sit in the rain because you\u2019re too scared to be slightly near a tiny dog on a leash. Jesus", "YTA. Phobias are very real. But they are your problem and not everyone else's (and I don't mean that in a mean way. I just think a lot of amateur mental health professionals have ingrained that the opposite is true, and that's just not how it works in the real world)", "You either need to accept that other people and dogs have the right to exist in the same spaces or bring appropriate weather clothing\n\nIf the dog had come over to you - then you would be in your rights to say excuse me please keep the dog away - but you cannot expect other people to suffer when you are the one with the issue as the dog is behaving and you are the one who has not worn appropriate clothing", "YTA.  Why in the world would they deserve to have to stand out in the rain when they\u2019re already in the shelter?  Why should they not be allowed to be warm when you are also warm?", "YTA. Ask your mum and dad to take you to the GP, who can refer you to a specialist to help you overcome your phobia. It's your responsibility to make sure you become the kind of person who can function in normal situations, like sharing a train with a well-behaved small dog.\n\nEDIT: Also, why are you claiming to be 15 in a previous post, and 13 in this one?", "Wear pants", "YTA, big time. Nobody should have to bow down to you over your fear, that\u2019s your problem. Preventing them from warmth was a dick move. Grow up.", "You need to get over your phobia. Yta", "YTA and also it doesn't sound like you have a phobia of dogs. You have an aversion. You have dogs you know and therefore are ok with. \n\nIf you had a phobia you'd be having a significantly more negative reaction to being near them.", "You already posted this", "YTA. You don\u2019t ask THEM to move. YOU move. You\u2019re responsible for your phobias. Sounds about right for a 13 year old though. You\u2019ll hopefully grow up soon.", "You were in the wrong for this but you\u2019re only 13 so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an arsehole if you learn from this now. Just wanted to suggest that on days you do sports, bring a warm pair of joggers to put on over the top of your shorts when you\u2019re done!", "You sound entitled. You seriously need to seek treatment for your phobia so you can stop bothering other people with it \ud83d\ude44\n\nYTA.", "YTA. It\u2019s not their responsibility to control your triggers. I was mauled by a big dog when I was 13. Absolutely shredded and almost killed. But I never put my fear of dogs on anyone else. I worked through it and now I own two huge dogs and three smaller ones. It\u2019s something you have to learn to get past.", "YTA-The dog wasn\u2019t aggressive. They might have reacted poorly, but they don\u2019t have to accommodate your fears. Are you going to so this if a classmate of yours have a service dog? Also, you should have dressed more appropriately for the weather.", "YTA. You need to grow up and stop expecting the world to revolve around you. The couple did nothing wrong and you acted like an entitled brat.", "the world doesn't revolve around you or your phobias, get help\n\nYTA", "ESH - YTA before the train arrived for trying to make them stand out in the rain, they're TA for trying to sit very close to you when they could either have gone into a different carriage or a different area of the same one.", "Question: do you honestly think it's fair or decent to ask strangers to inconvenience themselves due to YOUR irrational fears?", "YTA. Welcome to the real world where your triggers and phobias are your issues to deal with. There are no safe spaces in life.", "YTA\n\nYour phobia isn't theirs to worry about.  It isn't their responsibility to cater to your phobia.  YOU move.  YOU sit in a different carriage.  YOU deal with YOUR phobia.  You have no right to force others to deal with YOUR phobia.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s your job to accommodate your phobia. Not anybody else\u2019s. I hate rat dogs too, but I tolerate them if they are by me.", "YTA", "YTa this sun doesn\u2019t seem like a great place for 13 year olds tbh", "I don't understand how small dogs are scary but big dogs are ok. Seems like it would be the other way around. \n\nEither way, YTA \n\nIt's your problem, you should move", "Soft YTA \nIf you don\u2019t fear all dogs then I think you should get therapy to get over your fear of little dogs. \n\nYou need to be able to navigate the world and not have the world navigate around you.", "ESH-while I am empathetic to your phobia and your fears/concerns are valid, it is no one else's responsibility to tip-toe around your phobias or go out of their way to accommodate you. Yeah, it would be the kind thing to do, but you aren't entitled to special treatment.\n\nThem making a beeline for you in the car was dead wrong and rude of them. You asking them to stand in the rain because you wanted to be in the sheltered area but didn't want to be near their dog was a stretch. It doesn't hurt to ask, but you have no right to be angry that they didn't leave their warm dry spot that they obtained prior to your arrival to go stand in the rain just because you're scared of dogs.", "Gentle YTA, because phobias are real, but I'm not sure you get to make people stand out in the rain or sit in the cold because you have one.  Also, it's your responsibility to dress appropriately for the weather, not expect others to inconvenience themselves because you didn't wear warm clothing.", "YTA You\u2019re young, and I understand that phobias are challenging, but if you can\u2019t be near small dogs, you need to be the one to move. The dog wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, and the couple had just as much right to be in the shelter as you did. \n\nImagine that I had a phobia of backpacks and you were wearing a backpack when I walked up to the shelter. If I asked you to move and stand in the cold, sleeting weather to accommodate your phobia, would you happily do so?", "Pro tip: put on sweat pants OVER your shorts before leaving the gym, when weather calls for it.  At the ask someone politely if they would stand between you (at one end) and the dog at the other, because you are working on your dog phobia.    YTA", "YTA, people doesnt have to cater to your phobias, you need to learn to live with it", "Yta. Toughen up for Christ sakes. Tiny dog in a rain coat.  So scary \ud83d\ude44", "ESH. \n\nLike I also have phobias and understand how difficult that can be, and how people who don't have phobias don't necessarily understand what that's like, but also I know my phobias are not reasonable and I can't expect everyone to change their behaviour for me. \n\nAsking people to stand in the rain I think is a bit much, but they definitely could have talked to you with a lot more understanding. \n\nNot what you're asking, but have you considered therapy to help you manage better with dogs being near you?", "ESH but very lightly on your end. You\u2019re 13, so I wouldn\u2019t hold you to the same standard that I would a 23yo in this situation. It\u2019s sort of expected at your age to still be figuring out how to navigate situations like this by yourself, and that includes sometimes getting it wrong. As far as getting it wrong goes, I feel like this is fairly minor. Your request was a little unreasonable, but it still was *only* a request and it sounds like you asked politely and didn\u2019t try to make any trouble when they said no (you\u2019re not responsible for the ladies who were mad at the couple, they\u2019re adults, they make their own choices). I feel like this situation was more a case of naivety than entitlement. \n\nThe man was also a bit of an asshole in my opinion because his reaction was a little dramatic. It was a mildly rude request from a nervous child but he acted like you\u2019d ruined his *entire week* just by having the audacity to ask. \n\nIn the future, the right move would be to just move yourself to a different carriage rather than ask someone else to move to accommodate you.\nThis is probably also going to happen again eventually, so try to think ahead of some things you could do to cope.", "Yeah YTA, if there's a situation you move yourself from it, the others involved did nothing wrong, maybe a little rude but ultimately they had a right to be there as much as you do.", "YTA - and heres a different perspective if you disagree. lets say I have a phobia of jackets because I was suffocated by one as a child. I see you outside wearing a jacket and ask you to take it off because it triggers me then get other people to berate you because you would not take off you jacket. Start to make sense why I would be the AH in that situation?", "ESH- your phobia is real and people are scared of dogs for good reasons. \n\nThat said you are on public transit, you are going to be reasonably exposed to the public... Including, unfortunately the dogs allowed in public. You can ask but you're not entitled to have other member of the public leave the area you want to occupy. And glaring at people because you didn't dress for the weather is AH behavior. \n\nThey are AHs for exposing their dogs to a fearful person. Dogs arent mechanisms of terror... And putting dogs in direct vicinity of people freaking out is a bad idea for the dog and for the person. Trying to immediately sit their dogs right next to you was a horrible horrible idea... And complete AH behavior.", "YTA big time.", "Your phobia isnt their problem. This was a public space and you inserted yourself. YOU move to a different space. YOU make space away from the dog at the station.\n\nAnd\u2026\u2026They aren\u2019t the dumbasses wearing shorts when it is freezing, YOU are. Your being cold is immaterial.\n\nSee how everything was about accommodating YOU there at their expense? What you did is called being entitled. \n\nYTA", "YTA but also wow Im glad I wasnt on reddit at 13...", "YTA. It\u2019s not everyone else\u2019s problem.", "NTA. So you asked politely the first time and accepted their answer and moved yourself. You got to your seat first, then politely asked again. You probably would have moved again if they insisted on taking the seat. Why is no one permitted to politely ask, why are dogs permitted literally everywhere these days and why does everyone place dogs above people, even children? I love dogs, I've always had dogs and I have one now, but my first instinct is to make sure a child is safe and warm. Why be unnecessarily nasty to a kid?", "I disagree with the YTA in this case. People with animals are so entitled. People on trains should not have to deal with other people's pets. Bird, hamster, dog whatever. Trains and other forms of transportation are for people. Not animals.", "YTA, as is the lady on the train who monopolized an entire seat.  Your phobias are yours to manage or get treatment for, as is dressing appropriately for winter weather.", "NTA", "ESH. \n\nAs someone that\u2019s been attacked by a dog, I get it and have sympathy for you. \nThe dog owner under the shelter shouldn\u2019t have reacted the way he did. \n\nHowever, you are the AH here for asking passengers to go to another carriage, that is just  over the top behaviour. Don\u2019t try and avoid dogs all your life, you need to find a way to make yourself comfortable around them as they are everywhere. \n\nYou still have a lot to learn about how you go about handling situations, that\u2019ll happen as you grow up. This situation is an example of what you shouldn\u2019t do. Maybe try and seek therapy to help get over your fear.", "ESA - You can not expect other people to accommodate your phobias in public places. However, the man was unnecessary harsh and the comment when leaving the train was plain immature.", "Going against the grain - but as a dog owner I'm going to say NTA. \nNo, if you walked up to the shelter and there was a dog already there onus is not on the owner to move. But it sounded like they didn't have to dog on a tight lead and were letting it roam/sniff. If I am in public with my dogs and we're around other people/strangers expectation is I keep them at my feet and out of other people's space. I don't thing it would have been inappropriate to politely ask the dog owner to keep the dog closer to them/in better control. \nOnce inside the train - you had already made it clear you had a phobia of dogs and had already been seated when they entered the train. The non-AH move as a dog owner is to go \"that person has told me they have a phobia of dogs, let me make a reasonable accommodation and either switch carriages or at least not sit directly across from them.\" Standing in the rain is one thing, getting a heated seat in an enclosed space vs. a non-heated seat is another. They were out of the rain, I can only assume they found open seats on the train, I don't see the issue with just not sitting next to someone who has already verbalized their fear of dogs.", "NTA. You\u2019re a human child. You take priority over dogs. As I write this, my three dogs are at my feet.", "NTA- I can\u2019t believe the number of people on here who don\u2019t have empathy for a child that has a phobia based on a traumatic attack. She asked nicely outside and the adult was extremely rude to her. The guy could have easily been kind picked his dog up and moved to the other side of the shelter, accommodating both his needs and the child\u2019s needs.\n\nThen once on the train the guy with the dog moves towards her despite already knowing the issue. It would have been easy for him to get in the next car or at least not move towards her. Once again he thought of himself and didn\u2019t make even the tiniest effort to be kind or come to a compromise. The adult needs to do better.", "NTA\n\nYou're 13, you have a strong phobia of dogs, and yes you asked them to move bec of your phobia, and they said no, you accepted and said nothing.\n\nNow, you got to the comfortable, warm seat first, and you  told them to stay away bec sitting in such proximity with a dog would triggering and difficult, so you reciprocated and another passenger told them off, backing you up. \n\nThing is you're a kid, and no, a dog is not above a traumatized child. However, I think you're both even, they got first and got to keep the place, and then, you got the place first and kept it.\n\nHope you can get therapy and get over your phobia.\n\nNOTE: I don't have phobias, I love dogs.\n\nNTA", "NTA Those people with the dog are the assholes, you were entitled to get a warm seat just like they were entitled to hog the shelter. Fuck dogs and fuck those people", "NTA Not everyone is ok with dogs and they were rude af.", "NTA-but only because you\u2019re a child. You had no right to ask them to stand in the sleet because you\u2019re afraid of their dog, but you\u2019re a child, and don\u2019t know how wildly inappropriate that is, and they DEFINITELY shouldn\u2019t have gotten loud with you if you had asked nicely, just a \u201cno.\u201d Would\u2019ve done fine, dick. And they definitely shouldn\u2019t have tried to seat themselves near you on the train. The persistent bugging of you makes them the AH here. \n\nStrange child asks you a rude-ish question? Oh why not yell at them then sit close to them on the transpo?\nVery grown up", "Hm I think NAH, there\u2019s no harm in asking politely. I think the harm would have come if you argued. But when you got your answer, to handle your phobia you stood in the rain. I have a fear of all dogs but I\u2019m not brave enough to advocate for myself in spaces made for humans so I often just remove myself or inconvenience myself. It\u2019s my phobia. Sure it\u2019s because of an unleashed dog attack unprovoked but it\u2019s still personal trauma to deal with. If those adults had really decided to come near you after that they\u2019re probably some weirdos. Like grow up. They\u2019re acting like they\u2019re your age.", "Personally I never like making my issues stranger\u2019s problems but they seem a bit inconsiderate so I wouldn\u2019t feel bad but I wouldn\u2019t have asked in the first place I\u2019d have just moved away", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Which is not something I thought I\u2019d be saying to a kid, but\u2026 They didn\u2019t choose for you to be underdressed for the weather. They *were* in the shelter first and should not have needed to leave. They shouldn\u2019t have needed to make accommodations for you on the train. You recognize that you have a phobia, and by definition that means that the fear is irrational. You need to learn to suck it up, because the world isn\u2019t going to change for your irrational fear of small, well-behaved dogs.", "Soft YTA I was bitten by a dog as a toddler and some dogs were really scary to me for many years after, but I removed myself from the situation it wasn\u2019t the dog or their owners problem or fault. When I was younger my parents would often ask if the dog was friendly and I could ask if it was a boy or girl, what it\u2019s name was e.t.c and over the years I became more comfortable would let the dogs sniff me and sometimes pat them. Now I\u2019m super comfortable around dogs as long as their body language is friendly.", "YTA", "YTA you don\u2019t get to tell people what to do or where to be because you don\u2019t want to be in the same vicinity of a dog. BUY YOU CAN get the hell away from them.", "I\u2019m a rower, too, and in the winter and early Spring (and actually most of the rest of the time too) I have spare clothes in my bag so I\u2019m equipped for any weather I might encounter. That generally includes a poncho and rain pants, as needed. Where I live (southern US) it gets hot enough that I don\u2019t mind being wet in the summer, depending on what I\u2019m wearing.", "ESH. you\u2019re an asshole for not just moving but other dude\u2019s an asshole for not at least respecting people\u2019s phobias a little bit. bro just came out with I WAS HERE FIRST", "soft YTA in this situation because you\u2019re young. learn from this", "Yta deal w ur trauma dude", "This, right here.\n\nSince I was young I've had a huge phobia of clowns.  As phobias sometimes do, it's spread to encompass anything with a person's face covered - COVID has been a challenge for me with people's faces masked.  \n\nWhen I go to places like amusement parks or sports games, if the mascot is walking around, my friends know to help me watch for the mascot.  It's MY job to avoid the mascot - not the other way around.\n\nThere is a very minor exception.  At one time, I knew the person who played the mascot for a minor league teams.  This person KNEW my phobia (and it's a true panic attack-inducing phobia, not just \"this thing creeps me out\" thing) but always made it a point to come to my season ticket seat during a game.  In THAT case, that person was TA.", "Op didn\u2019t demand they asked politely. If a stranger politely asked me to do something to help them with a phobia I would try to be kind to them. The well being of strangers can be important and it can dictate how strangers act if the stranger is kind. You\u2019re essentially saying OP is an AH for asking for kindness..", "I agree the dog wasn't barking, growling or snapping at anyone or even straining the leash", "I completely agree with this. Hypothetically, would it be an asshole move to ask that they hold their small dog or keep it tighter to where they are seated? That seems like a reasonable compromise. \n\nI think it is inconsiderate in small spaces to let your dog just walk up to random strangers in such tight spaces. I have had bad experiences with dogs, and therefore I hate them, but I mostly hate owners who don't control their dogs.", "I found it insane that OP was out in -3\u00b0 weather in shorts", "I agree with all your points, you're spot on, so to me it makes this ESH. Except for the dog.", "The internet has.", "If you were in a situation where you explained your phobia of thunderstorms to someone and in that situation they had the ability to ease that phobia but chose to be rude to you wouldn\u2019t they be an AH?\n\nNo one is required to accommodate people\u2019s phobias but they can respond with kindness to those phobia, the adult in this situation didn\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t you want someone to respond with kindness to your phobia if you explained it to them?", "Or just wearing weather-appropriate clothes would be a start", "I get it, and do you think is fair to seat with your dog next to a child who already told you they had phobia of dogs in a small, enclosed space? \n\nThey missed on other available warm seats because they wanted to seat precisely with OP\n\nAsking is not a problem when the person accepts the response like OP did, but following a child with a dog phobia to seat with them is truly bonkers", "It's a train. There is no line but a beeline in one way or another. She doesn't own the seats around her (or even next to her if it is busy) so honestly the lady who took up 4 seats to prevent the man and his dog from sitting near the radiator is also an AH.", "Not right next to her, in a set of seats the next row down. In the warm part of the train.", "NTA\n\nJFC\n\nFinally someone that understands, besides she told them about her phobia, and yet they wanted to seat next to her? Why? There were other warm seats available, but because they wanted precisely the seat where OP was sitting, they lost the chance to seat at the others. And the seats would place the dog very, very close to her. \n\nI have no idea why folks want to take their dogs everywhere, all the time, church, all types of events, restaurants, etc I don't get it. And placing pets over children's is a big no for me and I love dogs. The trend of being nasty and hateful to kids is worsening, ugh", "I get the impression you\u2019re not British. Dogs/pets on leads are allowed on public transport here and it\u2019s very normal to see them on trains/buses etc. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect not to see them.", "Lmao no. If OP is old enough to ride the train alone, they can remove themselves from an unconfortable situation", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

OP\u2019s phobia is based on a traumatic event where they were attacked. If you were attacked by a clown then you might tell a clown to stay away from you and you wouldn\u2019t be an AH for doing so especially if you explained to the clown that you were afraid of clowns!", "I think it would be perfectly okay for OP to share that he is scared of dogs and could they please hold their dog or keep it close to them. That seems reasonable so everyone could share the space. I would hope most people would respond positively to such a reasonably worded request.", "It isn\u2019t an AH move for OP to suggest a compromise, but an adult with more life experience is more likely to think of this compromise than a kid unless that adult is an AH who gruffly responds to that kids request.", "-3c isn\u2019t so bad.  I live in the USA and there are high school boys in shorts all winter long.", "-3 isn't that bad if you're not soaking wet. Probably didn't expect the sleet.", "Exactly, the younger generations  think everyone has to accommodate  or include them or its wrong.", "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "That's not the way I read the story. OP says they sat in a double, and the dog owners tried to sit in the 4-seat but OP threw a tantrum because they were merely in the same car. Again, asking strangers to inconvenience themselves due to OP's own irrational fears", "I agree. I feel it does no harm to ask, but once they said no, she needed to respect that. They have just as much a right to be there as anyone else and her phobias are her responsibility, not any one else's. The lady encouraging her entitled behavior and taking up all of the seats was the main villain in this story", "My understanding is the bank of 4 was directly adjacent to the bank of 2 the OP was in.", "No, the lady was in the seat behind her and moved to where OP was sitting, taking over the other warm seats that were facing her, so is four seats, two and two facing each other, so the woman was able to sprawl herself on the remaining seats.", "... which is PRETTY MUCH WHAT I JUST SAID \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Oh it was celsius. I thought it was Ferhenheit", "I used to live in upstate New York. Nothing is more powerful than a gaggle of teenagers in negative weather talking about how cold they aren't", "A double seat on a train means two seats facing each other, and she was sitting on one of the four seats, the other woman sat on one of the four seats and sprawled herself on the rest of the seats. They made a beeline following OP to seat with her on those seats, missing out on other available warm seats that's why the woman told them to go to the next car to find available warm seats. \n\nWho tries to sit with a child in such enclosed space with a dog when they already told you they have a dog phobia?", "Agreed on main villain!", "If I am envisioning it right, it is the next row down:\n\n|S S|S    \n|S S|S\n\n--4---2\n\nEither way, it doesn't make the dog owner an AH to want to sit in warm seats on public transit.", "You responded \u201cthis right here\u201d to the post where the person said your phobia isn\u2019t important to strangers and that it cannot dictate how others act. I\u2019m trying to point out that your phobia can be important to strangers and they can act to help you if you explain it to them and they treat you with kindness.\n\nI do hope that strangers help ease your phobia if possible, and you would never be the AH for politely asking them to do so.", "Description is \"1 double and 1 4 seat per carriage\". Sounds to me like they are two separate things, but I guess I can't be sure without a diagram.\n\nAnd for your other question - it seems to me like the dog owners didn't care to cater to OP's demands. I'm assuming that whatever area this took place in allows dogs on trains, or else that would have been mentioned.  The dog owners were within their rights, and it was on OP to move if she didn't like it.\n\nWhere do we draw the line in asking others to inconvenience themselves for our whims? If OP says \"I don't feel comfortable around people wearing hats\" would the other passengers be obligated to remove them? If OP says \"I don't feel comfortable riding a train with black people\" should all POC be forced to ride a different train?", "Okay.  Cool.  Whatev.", "Maybe my response was too strong, didn\u2019t mean to insult. Probably time to take a Reddit break, have a good night."]}
