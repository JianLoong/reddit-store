She stumbled over to the cake table and knocked it over, sending cake and frosting flying everywhere. My guests were horrified, and I felt like crawling under a rock and hiding. My family was so quiet and I felt so awful at such a wonderful day.\n\nAfter that night, I knew that I couldn't invite her to my wedding. I didn't want to risk her ruining my special day.

If they're getting engaged, OP surely knows her fianc\u00e9's sister, so some background info would be appreciated. Also, what kind of a relationship does OP usually have with SIL?\n\nIt is worrisome that the SIL hasn't apologized, but, as you said, if she's never had any problems with alcohol before, there was probably something to trigger this event.  NTA for being worried, but I'd try to get to the bottom of what had happened first.", "Frankly it bothers me that your fianc\u00e9 is neutral.

An alcoholic.\n\nOn that note, I have a brilliant idea. Let your in-laws know that you accept that she was drunk and is really sorry for her behaviour. You will allow her in your wedding, IF she gets admitted to a rehab centre prior to the wedding and the rehab gives you an assurance that she's sober and capable of managing on her own in company.

BUT she's probably embarrassed to speak to OP.\n\nOP needs to communicate directly with SIL and say 'we need to talk'.

Why would you risk a repeat at your wedding?", "ESH. It\u2019s not just your wedding, it\u2019s your fianc\u00e9\u2019s too.", "NTA, Tell the family that if she comes you guys are only serving mocktails. Watch how quickly their allegiance with her crumbles.", "NTA. \n\nI don't blame you at all for not wanting SIL at your wedding and being upset about what she did at your party. BUT, you are marrying in to this family, hopefully forever, and if all otherwise get along (not SIL, but other members of the family) you may want to extend an olive branch or participate in a better way forward. I guess the question is- do you want a strained relationship with many in laws over this?\n\nMy guess is no, so my advice would be first make sure you and fiance are on the same page, and then tell your inlaws: SIL has not apologized for what she did at the party, so we do not \"need\" to forgive her since she hasn't even tried to make amends. For us to forgive and move on, she needs to apologize, not just for being a drunk mess who caused a scene, but for saying hurtful things about our decision to get married. And then she has to commit to not drinking at the wedding, and we need to hear from you- other inlaws- that you do understand that her actions were inappropriate and that you will keep an eye on her at the wedding. It worries us that your reaction to what she did is to excuse the behavior and put it on US to move on, not on SIL to make amends and ownership for what she did. \n\nIf you two can agree to say that and to those conditions, and your inlaws (SIL included) can agree to it, then it might be worth saving yourselves decades of headaches by letting her come. Tell the bartenders/planners SIL is your problem child and to keep an eye on her, and enlist a trusted friend/relative to keep an eye on her and get her out of there if she gets drunk. The likelihood is someone will be drunk at your wedding, and 99% of the time, that person doesn't cause a \"scene\" that ruins the wedding, they just give everyone something to laugh about and gossip about. It has zero impact on the couple or the wedding memories. So remember that if you put all this in place and she does act up, she can be escorted out quickly and will not ruin your wedding, unless you let it take over.", "NTA - \"just the alcohol talking\" there's a reason the saying in vino veritas, in aqua sanitas - in wine truth, in water health - exists, because it's accurate \ud83d\udc4c\n\nSIL should've stuck to water and maybe she would still be invited, but she didn't.

NTA\n\nI would keep her away from wedding as well...\n\nGood luck!", "I wouldn't uninvite her, but I would \"assign\" someone to her, like a confident family member or bridesmaid. As soon as she starts causing a scene, she is whisked off and deposited in her car, where her date or MIL or whomever can take her home/hotel.  \nYour engagement party fiasco was her only warning, and anything approaching that won't be tolerated. \nThis might be fun for the person assigned this role.", "NTA. So, I had too much to drink at my sister\u2019s wedding - so I was like this is too harsh. However, there was no scene like this! I left in the limo and fell asleep. That was it.", "NTA.\n\nDo you really want her to knock over the wedding cake/wedding cake table/buffet table?\n\nIf you are willing to let her come under the strict instructions not to drink or with a one or two glass limit(preferably so long as she's consumed a significant number of carbs before taking so much as a sip of alcohol) make sure you have security remove her if she gets drunk and/or goes anywhere near the the wedding cake/wedding cake table and/or seems anyway tipsy and/or does anything else to create a scene and/or says anything rude and/or so much as looks at you funny. And apply those rules to the other in-laws as well.", "NTA. I was your SIL, and I didn't learn until people stopped inviting me to things. \n\nI'm 2 years sober now and while I'm still an embarrassment, I am an embarrassment for entirely different reasons. \n\nMaybe this will be one of the things that helps her change.

Any time I hear somebody pull the old \"it was the alcohol talking/acting, not me,\" I start to see red.\n\nI'm definitely a drinker, along with many of my friends, and we ALL understand that drinking is not an excuse for crummy behavior. If I get drunk and make a mess / insult somebody / behave poorly, it's on me to make amends. The same is true of your SIL - I would bet my last penny that this isn't the first time she's gotten drunk and made a fool of herself. She knows what alcohol does to her, and she made the decision to drink anyway.\n\nThe fact that her family are all covering for her and trying to shift the guilt onto you means that she's done something like this before, and is used to a whole family of enablers telling her that it's not her fault. If this was a one-off thing, they'd all be mortified and begging your forgiveness, your SIL first and foremost.\n\nForgive your SIL if you want, but always remember that to forgive is not to forget. Regardless of what anybody says to the contrary, you are NOT obligated to invite her. Not to keep the peace, not to appease her family, not to smooth things over... that's not your job.
