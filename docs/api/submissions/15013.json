My fianc\u00e9 and I had spent months planning it, and we were excited to celebrate with our closest friends and family. But things took a turn for the worse when my sister-in-law showed up.\n\nAt first, she seemed perfectly pleasant. She congratulated us and even gave us a gift. But as the night wore on, she started drinking more and more. Eventually, she was slurring her words and stumbling around the room.\n\nI tried to ignore it and enjoy the party, but then she started making inappropriate comments. She told me odd remarks like, \u201cI was just okay for her brother\u201d or just under exciting comments about me. My fianc\u00e9 tried to intervene, but she just laughed it off and kept drinking.\n\nFinally, she made a scene that couldn't be ignored. She stumbled over to the cake table and knocked it over, sending cake and frosting flying everywhere. My guests were horrified, and I felt like crawling under a rock and hiding. My family was so quiet and I felt so awful at such a wonderful day.\n\nAfter that night, I knew that I couldn't invite her to my wedding. I didn't want to risk her ruining my special day. But now, my in-laws are furious with me. Her family is saying that I'm being unfair and that I need to forgive her. But I don't know if I can. They are saying she just drank too much and the alcohol was talking not her. \n\nAm I the asshole for not inviting my sister-in-law to my wedding after she made a scene at my engagement party?", "created_utc": 1681722851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12p96m5/aita_for_uninviting_sil_to_the_wedding_because/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you can not accept that responsibility, then you know not to drink at all.", "NTA - it's totally fair enough that you don't want her to do a repeat at your wedding.", "NTA. \nIt\u2019s clear that shes either incredibly reckless and lacks all self awareness or is bitter and holds some resentment against you or your relationship with her brother. Deciding to get sloppy drunk at an event for one of the biggest, most important nights of your brothers life says everything about how she would behave at the actual wedding. \u201cShe drank too much and the alcohol was talking not her.\u201d Why did she even allow herself to get drunk enough to the point of knocking an entire cake off of a table and making a huge mess? The wedding is supposed to be about you and your partner, not babysitting your partners sister so she doesn\u2019t destroy everything and embarrass you.", "NTA. it is your wedding and you are paying.  you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for people you do not like.", "NTA if she\u2019s acting like this at your engagement party she will most likely do the same at your wedding. It\u2019s not a risk worth taking.

However I feel like there is more to the story as you wrote. One drunk night and a few unpleasant comments to cut her completely. Why not give her the space for an apology or something first. Maybe put a condition tha she is not allowed to drink at your wedding or something like that.", "NTA\n\nDon't get drunk in people's engagement and wedding parties \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA if there\u2019s no sincere apology from SIL and it seems this is likely to be repeated at the wedding. Is this a common occurrence of SIL getting inappropriately drunk and making an ass out of herself? If so, definitely NTA for not inviting her. \nBut if she gives a real apology and is horrified by her actions, then I think you should let her come. \nSounds like she hasn\u2019t bothered to apologize, though, so looks like she\u2019s staying home!", "NTA. She *chose* to drink to the point of excess. Anything she does once she gets there is *entirely* her fault. She can't be trusted to apologise, she can't be trusted to take responsibility, but, most importantly, she can't be trusted not to do it again at your wedding.\n\nShe's rude, she clearly doesn't like you, and she's not in control of herself. If your future in-laws are the ones doing all the talking then you have *no idea* what she *actually* thinks of her behaviour. She can't be trusted, so she can't come.", "INFO: does your fianc\u00e9 want his sister there?\n\nI don't here a mention of him at all which makes spidey sense go off.", "That\u2019s awful. I\u2019m really sorry that she ruined your night that way. \n\nTBH, whether or not YTA isn\u2019t the real question here.

I hope your fianc\u00e9 is vocal to his family about supporting this decision - it would be very important to me, anyway. You can consider a re-invitation if SIL apologies to ya'll directly. They shouldn't expect you to forgive if they won't even expect her to say sorry. Or at least give a promise to not to drink during the wedding. No one needs a repeat of that bullshit.\n\nI truly feel for you though. Went through a similar situation with my wedding.", "Yes ywbta", "YTA\n\nSorry, but this is the grooms sister, he gets to decide if she comes or not and not you. Its both of your special day and he has to come to that decision after discussing it with you.\n\nShe should apologise and tell you both what happened and why. And how she will try to make sure she doesn't get into that state again.\n\nI would also say that alcohol does do strange things. but there are many reasons why she could have got so drunk including someone spiking her drink.", "I'm going YTA, sorry.\n\nThis isn't 100% your decision to make, you only have 50% say on this.\n\nAnd being as this is your fianc\u00e9's sister, it's a big ask to uninvite her.\n\nWe're talking about someone getting drunk and falling into a cake, this is stuff memories are made of, you should be thanking her.", "YTA, this is not up to you, it is a decision for your fianc\u00e9 to make.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I also have a lot of questions:\n\n- did your SIL apologise?\n- does she regularly get that drunk or was that a first?\n- did she have a reason for getting this drunk?\n- can you trust her not to do it again at your wedding?\n\nShe's your partner's sister and I understand his family being upset, but it all depends on why your SIL got so drunk and how likely it is that she'll get drunk at your wedding as well. If she has no history of alcohol abuse, I'd give her a chance to explain and apologies before uninviting her.", "\u039dTA if you had already discussed it with your fianc\u00e9 and you both decided to not invite her. It's your wedding as much as it is his, so him being aware and positive of this decision is what matters most, not what his family has to say about it.", "NTA: Maybe SIL doesn't want to come to the wedding. Maybe this family uproar is SIL's goal.", "So you said that you can't invite her to your wedding. Does your fiance have any imput on the guest list too? Or just you?", "NTA.  It\u2019s your wedding just like it was your engagement party, which she did indeed ruin.  You can forgive her without inviting her to the wedding.  Actions have consequences and getting drunk isn\u2019t an excuse.  She was still responsible for what she did.  It sounds like her family condones her behavior which will only lead to it continuing - possibly at your wedding.  The risk is too great for what will be one of the biggest days in your life.  Nothing wrong with not inviting her.", "NTA.  It sounds like your inlaws are probably enablers so they can't be trusted when they try to minimize the situation.", "I\u2019m a big believer in the saying \u201cA drunk persons word\u2019s and action\u2019s are a sober person\u2019s hope\u2019s and dream\u2019s\u201d. She clearly doesn\u2019t want you marrying her brother for whatever reason- I\u2019m guessing plain old jealousy because you make no mention of her having a husband/partner- and is acting out. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to explain to his family that he doesn\u2019t want her at the wedding. Personally I\u2019d allow her there to placate your husband\u2019s family and give her the platform to properly embarrass herself In front of a whole wedding so you need never see her again. NTA.", "NTA - Your sister-in-law let her true feelings known when drunk.  To act like that at an engagement party is disgusting.  \n\nHer family sticking up for is a red flag that they will cover for her no matter what she does.\n\nShe won't apologize because theose are her true feelings.  Don't cave to them and don't invite her to your wedding.", "NTA. Has she apologised? What does your fianc\u00e9 think? If he\u2019s on board with not inviting her then go ahead if he still wants her there this gets a bit tricky. That\u2019s a terrible thing for her to do, and the family are making excuses about alcohol yeah because weddings are known for for there not being any alcohol! I wouldn\u2019t want the worry and risk either.", "This, she hasn't apologized. The only other thought to add you this is, yes it's your wedding. However, if she a apologizes maybe you can consider under the rule/compromise that sil can't drink or just 1-2 glasses. Because in the end you will marry your fiance and his family and maybe he (at some point) might be upset and will create more/future issues...", "Fianc\u00e9 is pretty neutral but supports me full on. SIL has yet to apologize, her family says she\u2019s sorry but she hasn\u2019t said anything directly to me", "My suggestion would be no alcohol. SIL does not regulate her alcohol intake.", "Then you are perfectly right not to invite her. She ruined your engagement party, is unapologetic and your in-laws are enabling her. \n\nIf it was \"the alcohol talking\" at the party, why hasn't she apologised profusely when she sobered up?", "Nta don't let her come or if you do get someone shadowing her and as soon as she starts drinking escort her out.\n\nTell the in laws  the conditions in advance if you go for option 2"]}
