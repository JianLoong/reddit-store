But I beg you - when you discuss this with her, do not bring up the piano lessons and martial arts classes.

I get paid well and capable of living on my own however I chose to stay with them and help around the house. Plus I won't be alone and will always have company.

Give her an ultimatum, get a job and pay rent or get out with a hard deadline.  It really is that simple.  Quit coddling her.", "NTA. She at the very *least* should be paying her car insurance, phone bill, and vehicle maintenance. Then add an amount for rent. Being 24yo college graduate with your parents paying for everything is not okay.", "NTA. 24 is well past old enough to have financial obligations.", "NTA. I might just tell her that it begins at a certain date and give her a month or two to find a job and begin working. I ended up getting a degree from a school overseas and had to come back to the US before job hunting (back in the pre-Zoom days). My parents were excited to have me home for a time, but it was structured. I had to job hunt and after a certain set of months, I would have had to pay.  I got home, but I figured out my next step, made some initial money, and then some time later I moved out.", "\u201cWe taught our child everything comes to her on a silver platter, and now we can\u2019t figure out why she expects everything on a silver platter.\u201d\n\nYou created this situation, so YTA for that and waiting until now to address it, but not TA for trying to teach a much needed lesson.", "Ywbta if you don\u2019t start charging her rent. Your job was to raise a responsible adult who could survive out in the world on her own, not make her so comfortable she never wants to leave home.", "NTA.  But don't charge rent, kids need to feel that home is a place they can go.  BUT, stop paying her bills.  Give her a timeline during which you will phase out the payment of expenses.  Start with the cell phone, unless she puts in her name and pays for it.  Move to selling the extra car, unless she buys it from you - no installments.  Then remove her from insurance on remaining cars.", "If anything, YTA for letting her coast for this long.

I would give her notice that it is happening. Maybe start with transferring the bills. Let her know that starting x date rent will charged as well. If you want give her a month or 2 before that happens.", "NTA, I am also turning 24 this year and living with my parents still but I happen to work full time so I contribute money for car payments at least since I\u2019m not paying rent or anything else. Six months post grad and no job? Even working a customer service type of job is SOMETHING. $200 really is not a lot to ask for.", "NTA. $200 a month is totally reasonable. I wouldn\u2019t bring up the list of what you\u2019ve paid for in the past though. You\u2019re a parent, that all comes with the territory.", "One TA, not for charging her rent, but for raising a daughter, that doesn\u2019t understand that she needs to contribute and doesn\u2019t have any desire to pay her own way. This is 10 years too late she should\u2019ve been paying a little bit for her own cell phone or her own insurance on her gas or something. $200 a month is actually two little, let her know that she\u2019s got three months to get a job or she needs to get out.", "Time to stop coddling her this much - she's plenty old enough to contribute to the household. In fact, I'd say it would be irresponsible if you don't teach her this soon. Set certain expectations, including rent and expenses. Cooking and cleaning too, if she doesn't already. **NTA**", "NTA and $200.00 is more than fair. But I would tell her she needs to look for a real job, like now. Sounds like you've made her too comfortable and she needs a little shove out of the nest here. Btw, I have a 19-year old in college and who also has a job so I can definitely imagine being in your place.", "ESH - she's a slacker and you are an enabler.\n\nThat said, if you don't _need_ the money, I highly recommend opening a savings account and dumping it there.

I know you guys didn't do this maliciously but you have crippled her from being a self sustaining adult.", "Nta \n\nThis is your fault.", "NTA\n\nShe's way too old to be acting like this.  My only thought is that $200/month is too little to charge her for rent.  It's going to need to be quite a bit more to really get her motivated to make some changes.", "NTA. She's an adult, adults pay their own bills. I'd charge her more rent than that.", "NTA\n\nyou should have stopped paying all of that the second she graduated, maybe have given her a 2-3 month grace period but no more than that.", "NTA, it's long past time to start charging her rent.", "Absolutely NTA.  Our adult daughter (22) lives with us and pays $300/month rent, $200 certainly sounds reasonable.", "NTA, since she\u2019s an adult and $200 for rent is nothing compared to actual rent\u2026Maybe she might have a bit of entitlement since everything has been paid for her. I would have done anything to have a car, phone and college paid for right out of the gate.", "NTA but barely..you are at fault here for enabling this behavior for so long", "NTA. At 14 I got my own job to pay my phone bill (it was the early 2000s and super expensive). When I got my license the agreement was I paid my own insurance. When my uncle (who\u2019s like my dad) bought me a brand new car for high school graduation, he paid the difference between the full coverage and what I was paying and split maintenance with me. When I went to college I lived rent free but had to maintain part time employment. These are normal expenses ALL young people should be required to pay as early as possible. There is no reason your daughter shouldn\u2019t have a job at the very least and $200 is extremely cheap to contribute considering her expenses. Her laziness will absolutely spread to your other children if it goes on much longer.", "NTA. Charge rent & turn off the WiFi. Tell her if she doesn\u2019t get a job she is going to lose the car and phone. It\u2019s time for tough love, actually it\u2019s past time for tough love.", "NTA for expecting your 24-year-old to actually be an adult and pay her own bills.  It seems unbelievable that you are. I would be inclined to stay away from calling it rent, as home should always be home. However,  she should absolutely be made to pay for her own phone, car, etc. As soon as my son turned 18, I ensured he had credit (such as his phone) in his own name to ensure he understood and valued his credit rating. You are doing her no favors.  I would also expect her to contribute something (even if it's a token gesture, like $20 a week) toward food and bills.", "NTA\n\nIt's completely reasonable to want her to contribute or start doing her own thing. You guys probably waited to long to be honest. Do try to recognize what she is doing or contributing. Also consider if there is any issues going on like depression or something.\n\nMaybe consider easier her into it and assist her if she asks for help getting her shit together. If she her education isnt useful it's not going to be simple for her to just go out and get a job that would allow her to support herself. Retail and food industry jobs just don't pay living wages. They could support $200 a month but that's kinda or a dead end.", "NTA, but should\u2019ve started with baby steps earlier on. Don\u2019t bring up the past, either - those were part of raising her. Rent is not unreasonable. Neither is her pitching in financially in other areas of the household. She needs to learn how to be an adult.\n\nMy adult son lives with me. He pays half of all of the bills. There was a time that I needed him to pay half, but my situation is better now. His went the opposite direction. I understood when he was struggling and we worked it out. He\u2019s responsible for his stuff - cell phone, credit card, etc. I\u2019m responsible for mine. Together we split rent, groceries, utilities, insurance, pet expenses. Right now, we\u2019re sharing a car, so if I use it and use a lot of gas, I fill it up. He does the same. New tires? Split the expense. New battery? Split the expense. \n\nDo I NEED him to pay half, or else we would be evicted/utilities cut off/car repo\u2019d? No. Does he get an itemized invoice every month? Yes. Why? He\u2019s an adult. If he was living with a roommate or 2, he would have to do the same. Sometimes when we go out, he\u2019ll pay. Sometimes I pay. Just depends. When he lost his job, he was worried about if we would be able to pay rent. It sucks that he was worried, but it showed that he does have his priorities straight.\n\nHowever, along with treating him like an adult financially, this also means that I respect him as an adult. If he goes out, it\u2019s really none of my business where he goes/who he goes with/what he does. His bank account is none of my business. He doesn\u2019t have a curfew. He has a house key. His room/bathroom is his personal space, and not my place to infringe upon his personal space. We really only have 3 hard rules - whoever cooks/purchases/provides meals isn\u2019t responsible for clean up. We each clean up behind ourselves. If one of us is gone overnight/out of town, the other has full pet responsibilities. His job? His business. Not mine. If he calls out one day, he suffers the consequences - not me.

You know better than me what you need to do.\u201d", "You\u2019re NTA for wanting her to pay her own bills, but you guys have to realize that this needed to happen a while ago. Your daughter has become lazy and entitled, thinking that her parents will always pay for stuff because you guys have. Sit her down and explain that she needs to start taking responsibility for her own bills and if you feel gracious, you can give her a month or two to prepare. \n\nAnd most of all, learn from this and don\u2019t make the same mistake with the other two kids.", "Nta. You've been very generous. My parents started charging me rent as soon as I hit 18 even though I was still in high school.", "200 dollars a month is not motivational,  it has to be more - it has to cover her share of utilities, wifi, her food.  She should be paying minimum 500 for rent and utilities and she must pay for her car and phone in full.   She doesnt need to get a proper job if you are charging her peanuts. She needs to pay enough to be motivated to get a job, to care about her life and to start thinking of independence whilst realising if she left she'll pay 2-3 times that for everything by herself.", "Not unreasonable, but YWBTA if you drop this on her suddenly, that will only make yourselves enemies to her. Talk to her like she\u2019s a person and not a freeloader, teach her what she needs to know about scams and paying bills, be a second set of eyes on her resume for job applications. DO NOT drop a bunch of bills in her lap and tell her to figure it out. Yes, she\u2019s probably capable, but she\u2019s your kid and apparently you haven\u2019t told/taught her these life skills before now. They don\u2019t teach you everything in college, I\u2019m in my last year of undergrad and I still call my mom when I need help understanding credit card terms and car maintenance issues, things that might seem easy to you.", "NTA I lived at home til 23 and from the age of 18 I contributed towards bills. Which she should be she's a grown ass adult and it doesn't cost you nothing for her to stay and due to being over 18 legally you have no responsibility. So if she's going to be a lazy ass use that logic.", "NTA that's pretty reasonable that an adult has to pay rent and contribute. \n\nI wouldn't bring up all the things for her as a kid though. That's part of being a parent. But now she's an adult and gets to take on adult responsibilities. I also wouldn't make any threat you're not willing to carry out. Parents charging rent always has an implied well if you don't pay rent are you kicking out your kid? But you can do mitigating things like hey I'm not paying for your phone or car insurance or maintenance anymore. And you can always stay here, but you only get the wifi password if you pay the rent of $200 a month. \n\nGood luck", "NTA, 200 in rent plus paying for her own car and phone is reasonable.

He felt entitled and it ended poorly, he has put us in the NC zone.  $200 is NOTHING for what she is getting, I'd recommend more, have her SIGN and agreement, and give her RULES for staying IN YOUR HOUSE.  Curfew, Chores, Noise Restrictions, what she is expected to pay for, etc.  If she complains, simply say \"You are free to find someplace else to live.\"  One thing you could do, take the money she pays you and put it in a separate account.

My mom made me pay for my own car maintenance (oil changes and smaller $ things) unless it was major starting when I got a job at 16. She has been through college and should be able to handle this. Get a plan together for you all to look at on how you want to transition her into a self sufficient adult who would be able to live on her own. You won't be around forever and she definitely needs to know how to handle these things.\n\nSit her down and show her what her budget looks like. So add up all of her individual costs that you want her to take over so she can see the dollar amount you have been covering. Then show her the (projected) amount for the entire year, since some things vary, like oil changes if she follows manufacturer recommendations, etc.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.

You've been paying everything for her her whole life and getting her expensive things while not having to do anything for it.

That, or tell her she gets one year after graduation, then she needs to move out for good.\n\nIt's one thing to let a kid stay with you when you know they're trying to move out. I stayed with mine for a few months after I graduated, and my parents didn't charge me rent. But I was working an internship at the time while looking for a place and full time job. If she were in school or trying to find something but struggling, it would be different. But it's clear she's happy to live off your generosity until you change something.

You've paid for much more than many parents do.", "YTA, not for the rent question, but for raising a child to adulthood who doesn't know she has to pay her own way in life.", "NTA. I\u2019m a little perplexed at the complete 180 degree turn on financial support as opposed to easing her into being independent over time, but I agree it\u2019s definitely appropriate to ask a 24 year old to be self-sufficient. The \u201ctough love\u201d approach may also strain your relationship with her in the short term but will probably be good for her in the long run.", "NTA for charging rent for a 24 year old still living in your house.  \n\nBut trying to justify it by stating how you provided for her when she was a child is ludicrous. You\u2019re a parent, you brought a child into this world, and it\u2019s your responsibility to provide for them fully to a certain point. You don\u2019t deserve sympathy or a gold star.", "YTA\n\nBut not for the reason you might think.  You've coddled your child so much in her life that at 24 she can't be a contributing member of society.", "NTA but brace yourself. Sounds like it will be a shock that you expect anything from her.", "I started paying rent shortly after graduating (so I was 18) and it was something like $250 a month. Mind you this was 19 years ago too so no, you charging only $200 isn\u2019t too much. My dad also at one point raised it for no other reason than he could. I protested he couldn\u2019t but he did anyways. I might have hated it at the time but I knew he was right. And I value that he gave me those life lessons early on as it prepared me for the reality of the real world. I run into so my kids today that are just entitled brats", "NTA at all. You\u2019ve done more than enough for her, it\u2019s high time she started to stand on her own two feet.", "NTA.  Perhaps you could talk with her about seeking counseling, for starters. There could be a lot more going on here than a 24 yr old being lazy. I know that gaming can become an escape mechanism, a self-soother, so I'm focusing on that angle.  Most adults of that age want to live independently so it's probable something else is going on. Having ADHD myself, my first thought was that she could be experiencing ADHD burnout after so many years of instructional obligations.  There are many other possible causes for her behavior, I only want to offer my life experience as food for thought that there are other reasons why people don't meet expectations besides being spoiled or lazy. A good counselor could help her find some answers. If she is reluctant to go, please consider going just for yourself.  They can help you in how to handle the situation from your end, and it would be fabulous role-modeling for her.", "No, you\u2019re NTA for wanting to make your child contribute. How you go about this, though, could be tricky. The goal is to remain emotionally supportive through what can be a very overwhelming time, while also not subsidizing her sitting on the couch playing video games 24/7. \n\nSit down with her, figure out what her life goals are, and come up with a timeline for how to get there. Not unreasonable to charge her some rent money, portion of expenses, etc, but you COULD be TA if you sprung this on her without warning or all at once. Set deadlines and then stick to them. \n\nThen make it known that this is the plan for all the kids. It may slightly vary depending on their individual goals/needs, but same basic plan.", "NTA\n\nIn fact\n\n1) stop paying her phone\n2) stop paying her car\n3) change the WiFi code and don't give it to her.\n\nIf she can't have the things she wants,  she might realise she needs to work.", "NTA", "My parents gave me 3 months after I graduated to get a job and start paying rent or to get out. Rent was $400 a month to basically cover utilities and food. I used my moms old car as she just got a new one. So while they didn\u2019t charge me for the car, I had to pay the insurance to be able to drive it, wash it every week and pay my own gas. My parents paid for my phone so that they could get a hold of me and vice versa. Their roof, their rules. \nThey weren\u2019t against helping me out because we all obviously want the best for our kids. But they weren\u2019t just handing us life on a platter. It\u2019s hard to have respect for things you just get handed all the time. \n\nIt\u2019s time for a wake up call named life. Sit her down and tell her she has a timeline (has to be reasonable) to start paying so much for rent and which bills you will be paying and which ones she will pay and how much they are. \n\nNTA to charge your child reasonable rent/expenses.", "NTA but dont charge rent. Ask her to pay utilities, and her own expenses. If she wants to still live rent free, she needs to get a job.", "I don't understand how so many are saying OP is a bad parent. Tons of parents fully take care of their kids throughout their entire education lol. NTA.", "So, she's 24, graduated from college 6 months ago, lives at home, doesn't work, mainly plays video games, doesn't pay a single bill.  Gee, why would she want to get a job?\n\nShe absolutely should be paying her own phone bill and her car insurance as well as the maintenace on it - and that should happen right away.  I'd give her a little notice and tell her that she's also going to have to start paying rent in 2 months - it really doesn't matter how much - just that she's paying something.\n\nIf OP just lets her do nothing, guess what the younger kids are going to expect.  Also, what type of lesson in responsibility is OP teaching the daughter if she doesn't make the kid accountable and responsibile for herself?  6 months is more than enough time to relax and recharge her batteries.\n\nNTA but will be if you allow this to continue.", "you don't charge your kids, that you chose to have, to live at your home. in 10 years they won't talk to you out of resentment, which is most likely coming anyway.", "NTA. I (20f), was paying almost $950 in rent to my aunt (rent is also absolutely ridiculously high in my area but due to the fact I was the only one with job out 7 people living in a house) but I was also 16 and making minimum wage while also paying for the electric, cabel, wifi, groceries, and my own phone bill which i shared with two other people, i never really had money to spend on myself. $200 is nothing.", "Yes, I know.  I was just giving context that I felt we gave them the best that we could and now I think it's time they understand the real world responsibilities they will need to shoulder.", "My daughters tell me that non of their friend's parents make them pay rent.  Also, when I asked my own friends they said they never made their kids pay rent.  So I don't think this is at all uncommon. My kids have had part-time jobs throughout high school and college, they paid their own gas and their own entertainment costs, but while they were in school we made sure to pay for the important things.", "Honestly it sounds like it's the first time in her whole life she's been able to relax. I did that when I first got to college--bare minimum for six months because it was the first time in years I didn't feel pressured to do all the things and get good grades and get into college.", "I didn't fail to reach her responsibility.  She has learned financial literacy from us.  She always had part-time jobs during high school and had to pay her own gas and entertainment costs for going out with friends.  We made sure to pay for the big items so she didn't need to stress while in school, especially college.  It's that not everyone charges their kids rent.  My children even have a retirement account and pay their on money monthly, which is not what a lot of americans do and they don't have enough when they retire.  So my question was about rent, as no parent in my friend circle charges their children rent at all.", "This..I almost voted esh.", "Not entirely true.  We always told them about saving and even thought them about retirement accounts to which they contributed their own money. Also, we made then read financial literacy books, so I think they are better off in some respects than most kids.  Also, we made them pay their own gas and their own entertainment costs when they went out with friends.  We just felt it was important to pay for the big costs while they were in school so they could focus on their studies and not stress about the other costs.  The issue is now she is fully graduated and really needs to learn about all the other costs that go into being an adult. The issue is that I know of no one in my friend circle that makes their own adult children pay rent.  So I wasn't sure this is the right thing.  I already told her she will need to pay her own insurance and phone bill, but not entirely sure of rent.", "Right? My kids are 25 and 27. They've been living on their own and financially independent for about 6 yrs now.", "Kids need to feel that home is a place they can go, but they don\u2019t need to feel that home is a place they can live for however long they want without paying rent.", "This is a good idea! \n\nMy parents never charged my rent and I have lived there on an off for the past ten years, between roles and finding the right rental situation.\n\nBut I always had to work to pay for my social life and since being 18 or 19 covered my phone bill and other bill expenses. Luckily they still covered the car costs, but where I'm from we don't have need a car so it's like the second family one.", "Right!?! Damn, I would never leave either!\n\nOP taught her to be THIS way and expects her to suddenly act a DIFFERENT way.  If OP wants her to get a job and move out... having the conversation would be the first step. From the sounds of things... this hasn't happened.", "That's how much my parents charged me while I was getting my Bachelors while living work them. \n\nI think the parents should charge her more personally and stop paying for luxuries such as car insurance and phone bills", "Wow, I'm impressed. Love this", "I interpret them listing what they paid for as trying to show that they set their child up to be a successful adult financially, socially and emotionally\u2014for them to be a gamer. \n\nThey may be doing too much actually.", "She's 24..the time to be gentle was a few years ago", "dehumanizing is the word. what the kid needs is therapy.", "Please read my other replies, this isn't entirely true.", "It's difficult to write the entire scenario of my children's upbringing, but needless to say this wasn't a complete 180.  They have been raised with money sense their whole life.  They got part time jobs during high school and college as they needed to pay their own gas and their own fun time with friends. I have talked to them repeatedly about the fact that after college they will need to start shouldering more payment responsibility towards car insurance, maintenance and phone bill.  They also have retirement accounts that they pay into on their own.  So they aren't clueless.  It's that non of my friends or really any I personally knows charges their adult children rent or anything.", "It's one thing to not charge rent if they are working and facing fur their own place.\n\nIt's very different if their life plan is.  No rent, free food, free WiFi. Minimise other living costs", "Personally I wouldn\u2019t have my kids pay rent (not that it\u2019s wrong for others to), but I sure as heck am not going to keep paying for phones and entertainment if my kids aren\u2019t in school.", "Rent is one thing but her car should be fully on her, her phone bill, insurance, travels, fun money...you did your job and no charging rent is not a bad thing. NTA.", "My parent didn\u2019t charge me rent when I graduated. I live in one of the top three most expensive areas in the US. That said, the deal was that I could stay rent free as along as I worked a full-time job, contributed to the household (helping with \u201cchores\u201d, buying food, occasionally cooking etc), and cover my bills (cell, car, insurance). I also had to save a good deal of my money, so when it was time to flap my wings I would have something to work with. \n\nMy Mom set me up for success by giving me reasonable expectations and responsibilities, while giving me the privilege of saving a ton of money I would have otherwise spent on rent. It was incredibly kind of her to do, and had she asked me for $200 a month I would have happily paid it (because you can\u2019t even rent a closet for that here).", "I was on the fence about that too, but the question was about rent.\n\nPart of me feels sad for the kid , they have a lot of catching up to do thanks to bad parenting in this department.", "We actually did have a conversation with all of our children.  So this is not entirely true.  I probably need to edit my original post.  My kids have had jobs while in high school and college, part-time.  They paid for their own gas, clothes, and entertainment with friends.  We just made sure to cover all big item costs while they were studying so they could work minimal hours to still have some fun on the side.  They have retirement accounts they have had since 18 which they contribute to monthly, which is better than most Americans.  They read financial literacy books, the question is about rent.  Of course, she knew she would have to pay for her phone and car stuff.  I'm asking specifically about rent since most parents I know of personally do not charge their children rent.", "Why, thank you. Times are tough right now, for so many people. Yes, he\u2019s my son, but he\u2019s an adult, and I strive very hard to treat him like it while at the same time instilling responsibility. I probably should have added that he did move out for a few years, and needed a place to land. The mutual respect is what allows it to work.", "I\u2019m not so sure of that. At 65 with two daughters 9 grandchildren and 5 great grandchildren being gentle has worked for me.", "That would be the case if they had approached it before, but if they\u2019ve never even hinted at her starting to pay her own bills then gentle is the best way to maintain a good relationship with her. \n\nThey also might want to give her x amount of time to find a job with proof that she\u2019s actively searching for jobs in the field she went to school in before requiring her to pay rent since it seems like the $200 is more to push her to become responsible and grow up than to help with the bills as $200 likely doesn\u2019t cover very much.  \n\nNTA either way, it\u2019s pretty greedy on the daughter\u2019s part to graduate college fully paid for by her parents and not made a move to get a job, move out, become an adult. It\u2019s also likely that she was coddled if none of this ever came up until she was 24 years old.", ">I was on the fence about that too, but the question was about rent.\n\nExactly. If the question had been, \"Am I a good parent?\" then the answer would have been different.", "Imo that's the problem, they didn't approach it before and enabled and raised her to be this way, so that's partially on them.", "Agreed..it's like OP kind of made their bed", "Please tell me how OP has been a bad parent?"]}
