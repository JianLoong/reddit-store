You seriously put her health at risk and you don't seem to care. It wouldn't have hurt you one bit to let her have a soda, while you taking her juice was an actual threat to her well-being.

Would it have been a good idea? Absolutely. Do any of my partners friends who he's known for 10+ years have any idea how to treat a diabetic emergency? Absolutely not. Im just glad theyve mostly stopped asking me (actually out of concern) if hes \"allowed\" to eat cake or something. \ud83d\ude44\n\nIm genuinely glad that you have exclusively supportive folks surrounding you. Serioidly. Thats so much safer for you, and other T1 folks. But IME, its not at all the norm.\n\n>We're supposed to believe the roommate never told them anything about her illness even though she could easily have a medical episode in the night (very common time for hypos) where only OP would be able to help her.\n\nTheres a lot of space between disclosing \"I have diabetes\" and expecting someone who **isnt her friend** to manage her chronic condition.\n\n> We're also to believe she did not instruct OP to not touch her juice boxes because they had a medical purpose.\n\nShe probably did exactly that. And OP didnt believe her because OP doesnt understand diabetes (like the vast majority of people, who still think the only way to get diabetes is to be fat)  and because theyre juice boxes not \"medicine\".\n\n> Then we're meant to believe the roommate just doesn't have anything else to eat. Like, those juice boxes were it, all that was standing between her an a serious medical episode.\n\nIf she'd had 4-5 at home and forgot to stop on the way home due to, say, brain fog...I could see a kid downing 4-5 juice boxes over a few hours. There goes the emergency stash.\n\n>The rest of the story also makes NO sense. The roommate claims it's too late for OP to go quickly to the corner store even though the roommate at that point is still not only fully conscious but also coherent (when hypos get bad diabetic people begin to be incoherent and have trouble asking for help, most people would mistake them for drunks), which means it's still early stages. \n\nExcept that the **diabetic** said for OP not to go to the store despite that being an objectively poor choice - almost like the diabetic roomie is experiencing decline in cognitive function. Again, sliding scale between \"I dont feel great\" and unconsciousness.\n\n>But somehow the roommate has time to wait for her boyfriend to come in and take care of her, which must have taken a lot more time. \n\nDepends.\n\nThe year my partner was disgnosed he locked himself out of our home in his PJs, due to low sugar brain fog and other circumstances. He walked to 7-11, begged a phonecall from the cashier, and then waited for me to leave wirk and drive 10m, then buy him a pop.\n\nHe was still conscious and mostly coherent when I got there. He wasn't making a lot of sense, and the cashier thought he was drunk (which is kinda fair given the pjs, brain fog, lack of shoes, wallet, and increasing trouble communicating etc), but he was able to drink the pop and groggily tell me what had happened as the sugar hit.\n\n>The story doesn't make sense. It's fake. It's trolling.\n\nIt seems completely plausible to me. People with emergency lows in public are *often* mistaken for drunk if they dont have a knowledgeable person with them. This has literally happened at my work (TBF, we do deal with intoxicated people sometimes multiple times per day. Hear hoofbeats, horses, etc). We have a mandated number of first aiders present at all times, and Ive been the only one to figure it out the 3 times its happened. Thankfully, I was there, and have an emergency stash of candy/pop.\n\nIm honestly glad you dont know people who are poorly informed about your T1. But its really not as common as you think. Youve got a great support network.", "Your reasoning is sound, but for the life of me I can\u2019t understand why people would invent stories like this. I have read enough stories here to know that people invent all kinds of crap, usually the worse the better. WHY? I can\u2019t wrap my mind around why someone would post awful invented stories. What is the point?I understand this questioning is pointless, but I am increasingly getting frustrated and feeling that I don\u2019t want to engage any longer. What do idiots get outof posting fake stories?", "I've known college educated, sexually active people in their 30s that don't know how someone becomes pregnant. The idea of someone not knowing anything about diabetes isn't surprising at all.", "Yeah, because you\u2019re stupid. Where country do you reside in where diabetes isn\u2019t talking about?", "Be more considerate and educated next time.", "Before you downvote OP, consider that they are educating themselves and taking suggestions.\n\nMegging people who are willing to learn makes us dumber collectively.\n\nJMO.", "You're lucky (or very disciplined) to only have had episodes where you were conscious enough to treat yourself. And I agree that tablets are awful but I know I'm glad my dad carries them around for when he's in a situation where he cannot get himself a sugary drink or ask for one.", "> What do idiots get outof posting fake stories?\n\n\nThe same thing a toddler  gets when they get into something they know they're not supposed to be in- attention", "Not to mention..,you stole her juice, it\u2019s only fair to let her have a Pepsi in return, like JFC. Even without the diabetes! \n\nYou want to give someone else\u2019s stuff away, you better replace it with the same or the nearest equivalent asap. And the next day is not \u201casap\u201d.", "Seriously if I walked in on someone on the floor looking the way I do during hypoglycemia (dazed, blue, and shaking) I'd move heaven and hell to get them whatever they were mumbling about no matter how ridiculous it sounded. I don't care what it is, you can pay me back when I know you're not dying anymore.", "It\u2019s not really correct to call any form of diabetes \u201cdiet-related.\u201d People with T2 can decrease their risks by following certain dietary practices, but all forms of diabetes are rooted in genetic abnormalities and triggered by non-dietary factors.", "You said they were juiceboxes.", "My partner is a \"fragile\" T1, admitedly, he does manage very carefully, but he nearly exclusively uses either gummies, candy, or frozen juice concentrate. The exceptions are treated with pop. I don't think hes ever had glucose tablets other than to try them in the education class we took just after his diagnosis.\n\nIn 20 years, he's had a single incident where he wasn't consious to treat himself, and since I was the first aider in that instance, I know exactly how lucky that is. And I treated it with pancake syrup, followed by the gross glucose gel from the EMTs when they arrived.", "Ohh for sure, probably both some luck and some diligence. I'm sure this isn't the norm. I also got diabetes much later in life than most type 1s so I probably don't have as much history with it as most people my age. The flash glucose monitoring systems have been a huge game changer for catching lows early too. I'm using the libre right now. The sensors are expensive but if it's something your dad could comfortably afford I highly recommend it or any like it.", "How much juice is needed really depends on the situation. A stubborn low can take a truly shocking amount of sugar to bounce back sometimes.", "He uses the Freestyle libre 2 (that alarm system is fucking amazing). He would use the 3, but they expire a bit too fast. I think they last a month and the libre 2 a year which does not make it feasible for him to use (I obviously mean expiration with no use, I know they last two weeks when you use them).", "I would not ever want to see her again if I was the roommate. I'd way rather get a text from my idiot former roommate.", "True.   Also depends on the beverage.   It takes less juice for me than soda for some reason.", "I just got a script for the libre 2 and I'm excited to get it. I didn't even know they had a libre 3 already. A one month expiration feels super unrealistic. I hope they can extend that a bit in the future.", "I wouldn't want to either. I still can't believe you didn't even replace her stuff before she got home."]}
