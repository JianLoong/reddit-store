She keeps juice in the house because as a diabetic blood sugar can drop suddenly and it's a very real medical crisis. It was terribly selfish of you to take her juice without permission in the first place, and even more so when you withheld a replacement when she was having a diabetic episode. You seriously put her health at risk and you don't seem to care. It wouldn't have hurt you one bit to let her have a soda, while you taking her juice was an actual threat to her well-being.

Hell, my BIL ran to CVS for ketone strips once because I was running high for no reason and felt like garbage.", "But not more than shipping and handling", "Definitely makes sense but I\u2019m still going to do everything I possibly can to make the situation right.", "It. Does. Not. Matter. \n\nYou almost killed a woman because you gave away something that wasn't yours and then refused to give away something that was yours. \n\nI don't care if there were only two drops of juice in the container. She was having a diabetic crisis and you refused to help her.", "A half gallon is a LOT of juice and you let your niece drink a half gallon of juice? That\u2019s literally 2 QUARTS", "Yes, it\u2019s terrifying, and you wouldn\u2019t help because you didn\u2019t believe her when she said it was an emergency. Awful.", "That's why the corner store wasn't fast enough. Had her boyfriend not been available, her only choices were 1) Fight you for the pepsi 2) Call the ER.", "If I were living with a diabetic, I would take a few minutes to educate myself a wee bit. Are you 7 and have never heard about diabetic coma????", "You just thought she wanted your drinks for fun?", "That's literally unbelievable. Normal person aren't that ignorant.", "It doesn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t take people shit from people and think it\u2019s okay. The entitlement.", "Because she was probably able to deal with it on her own when her roommate didn\u2019t steal the juices she had supplied and then refused to part with her special Pepsis", "Any functioning adult knows diabetes is a serious illness. It never occurred to you to ask about her health? Oh wait...it's all about you and no one else matters", "YTA but you won\u2019t be the AH if u apologize by acknowledging it was very serious and you put her in danger", "It doesn't matter as it wasn't yours to give away in the first place.", "Why do you think your rm was on the floor? Even if she wasn't having some sort of medical issue, why did think it was ok to give her drinks away without her permission but she asked for ONE soda and you denied her? Was it even your last one? Would it have killed you to have just had 11 sodas instead of a 12 pack? Your logic is seriously flawed. It's so flawed that I'm questioning whether or not this  really happened. It seems so blatantly obvious that what you did was wrong.", "Then maybe you should mind your comments on your roommates lack of college education, because clearly you don't know the basics of even replacing something you took", "Some diabetes are not diet related.   Since you didn\u2019t know you should have taken her word for it that she needed a soda.", "It's great you have supportive relatives! My diabetic roommate is an older relative (I'm their caregiver), and I have to make sure they take their medication and I monitor their diet. I always bring snacks when we go out and keep juice around because it doesn't occur to them to do it. Their doctor has warned them (and me) a few times over the years that they need to take care of their diet and take their meds. I also modified my diet around theirs so we eat the same foods (they believe it's important to eat the same foods. They copy what I do, so I have to set a good example). \n\nI always keep a diabetic first aid kit in the car, full of juice and snacks (no more blood sugar test needles because they stopped using those). It's been useful a thousand times over. I typically replenish every 1 or 2 weeks because they don't plan ahead.", "Plenty of YouTubers out there. They\u2019ll tell you all about going high and low. Your behavior was pretty inexcusable. \n\nNow, see, if you made an actual care basket, demonstrating you actually learned something through this, that might go farther. Hell, plenty of YouTubers have done gift giving guides for diabetics. \n\nA basket of sugar, after that stunt, would be a little insulting\u2026.to me, anyway. But you definitely owe her replacement juice.", "No the whole thing was a half gallon there was like a glass and a half left and she didn\u2019t finish it.", "I am writing out a very long apology text as we speak.", "That\u2019s exactly what you should do. \ud83d\ude00", "Thank you! Definitely will look into that.", "And the juice has already been replaced", "Clearly not true because a regular size glass would probably been enough for the roommate.  Obviously she didn\u2019t have enough and she was asking you where it was.   You\u2019re a liar as well as an entitled selfish child.", "Do it in person fgs.    You owe her that.", "Oh dear lord. Be an adult and apologize in person. You almost killed her. A text is absolutely inappropriate. A chicken's way out. \n\nYou show up on her door step with a case of juice, a massive bouquet of flowers and receipt for the exceptionally large donation to the diabetes foundation.  Then you get on your knees and beg for forgiveness.  \n\nA text is never appropriate when you almost kill someone...especially over something as stupid as a soda.", "Thank you and maybe ask what her favorite snacks are for low, so you can pick a few things up.", "Everyone in my family gets diabetes at some point, so if I get it, I'm ready. I already have iron-deficiency anemia and I get blood sugar issues and fatigue because of it. I already have the diet down, apart from the occasional pasta breakfast (certain pasta has a lot of iron. And breakfast is the only meal here that's a do-it-yourself). \n\nEating mac and cheese at 8 am (secretly like a raccoon) is a small price to pay to be a good example.\n\nAnd showing them diabetes in the media helps. Turk from Scrubs and Glenn from Superstore both are diagnosed with diabetes at some point. Media representation helps validate the experience.", "That\u2019s quite literally the least you could have done.", "I will try but I don\u2019t think she rlly wants to see my face rn (which is fair)", "Good idea. I see her eating starburst a lot so I\u2019ll try and buy the biggest bag of those I can possibly find if she doesn\u2019t answer.", "Then write a letter on paper and attach it to the bag full of juice boxes and text her that you have left it on the front door IF she doesn\u2019t answer.", "Starbursts are pure sugar and really easy to carry with you to treat lows. The juice is important not only because it treats fast but one of the symptoms of severe low blood sugar is stomach pain. Yeah, you desperately need to eat but it feels like someone is trying to tear your stomach out of you. Juice is easy on the stomach and hits the blood stream quick. Once the sugar level comes up a bit then food is okay. Thank you for listening to the comments--you're getting roasted but I see you commenting which tells me you are trying to educate yourself."]}
