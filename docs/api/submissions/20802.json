It didn't take long for me to realize that our building's \"security\" is mostly a joke. I can't go into specifics about what has happened since I moved in without this post getting flagged for rule 4, but I will say that multiple people have died in this building.\n\nMy partner and I have already decided to move out of this city because I'm currently pregnant with our first child, and we want to live somewhere more family-friendly. We are currently eight days from moving day. In the meantime, we installed a Ring doorbell camera to the front door of our apartment to reduce the risk of being targeted for a break-in or push-in. We've had it up for a couple of months now and have had no issues, until now.\n\nYesterday, new tenants moved into the apartment directly across from ours. Within an hour or two of moving into their unit, they knocked on our front door and told us to take down our doorbell camera. They argued that because their front door is in frame, the camera is an invasion of their privacy. I immediately refused, and told them that given the high crime in this neighborhood and building, we would be leaving it up for our own safety. I told them about the different incidents that have happened just since I moved in, but they didn't care. I mentioned that one of the reasons we had it was so we could turn the footage over to the police if anything were to happen to our unit or within view of our camera, and they became even more insistent that we take it down. Again, I refused, and they said that they would follow up with the property manager.\n\nI talked about it with my partner and he is in agreement that we're not taking it down. But I also spoke to a friend of mine who lives in the building, and she pointed out that since we're moving out in a week, I should have just taken it down to avoid the argument. I'm going to have to take it down when we move, so what difference would a few days make? But because I refused to take it down and argued with them about it, I've now potentially left them with a negative impression of their neighbors, which isn't fair to the rest of the building since we're only going to be their neighbors for another week.\n\nI felt good about my decision to keep it up after talking about it with my partner, but after talking to my friend in the building, I'm having some doubts.

You have a valid concern for your well-being, especially since you're pregnant.\n\nYour new neighbors may feel uncomfortable with the camera capturing their front door, but they should also understand the context and the need for it in this particular neighborhood. You explained the situation to them and even mentioned the possibility of helping law enforcement if necessary. It's unfortunate that they didn't show much empathy or concern for your safety.\n\nYour friend's suggestion to take it down early to avoid drama is understandable, but it shouldn't be at the expense of compromising your family's safety, especially when you're only a few days away from moving out. You've already made the decision to move to a safer neighborhood, which shows that you're taking the necessary steps for your family's well-being.\n\nIn this situation, it's important to prioritize your safety and the safety of your family.

Are you they planning on illegal activities?", "NTA. You have it there for your safety. End of discussion. Don't take that camera down.
