When I first moved to this city, I couldn't afford to live in one of the \"safer\" neighborhoods, so I found an apartment building that seemingly offered a lot of security, but was in a more affordable neighborhood. It didn't take long for me to realize that our building's \"security\" is mostly a joke. I can't go into specifics about what has happened since I moved in without this post getting flagged for rule 4, but I will say that multiple people have died in this building.\n\nMy partner and I have already decided to move out of this city because I'm currently pregnant with our first child, and we want to live somewhere more family-friendly. We are currently eight days from moving day. In the meantime, we installed a Ring doorbell camera to the front door of our apartment to reduce the risk of being targeted for a break-in or push-in. We've had it up for a couple of months now and have had no issues, until now.\n\nYesterday, new tenants moved into the apartment directly across from ours. Within an hour or two of moving into their unit, they knocked on our front door and told us to take down our doorbell camera. They argued that because their front door is in frame, the camera is an invasion of their privacy. I immediately refused, and told them that given the high crime in this neighborhood and building, we would be leaving it up for our own safety. I told them about the different incidents that have happened just since I moved in, but they didn't care. I mentioned that one of the reasons we had it was so we could turn the footage over to the police if anything were to happen to our unit or within view of our camera, and they became even more insistent that we take it down. Again, I refused, and they said that they would follow up with the property manager.\n\nI talked about it with my partner and he is in agreement that we're not taking it down. But I also spoke to a friend of mine who lives in the building, and she pointed out that since we're moving out in a week, I should have just taken it down to avoid the argument. I'm going to have to take it down when we move, so what difference would a few days make? But because I refused to take it down and argued with them about it, I've now potentially left them with a negative impression of their neighbors, which isn't fair to the rest of the building since we're only going to be their neighbors for another week.\n\nI felt good about my decision to keep it up after talking about it with my partner, but after talking to my friend in the building, I'm having some doubts. Maybe I should just take it down early to avoid any unnecessary drama this close to the move? But I also have to think about my family's safety above everything else.\n\nSo AITA for refusing to take down my doorbell camera to make my new neighbors more comfortable?", "created_utc": 1687952259, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l75gz/aita_for_refusing_to_take_down_my_doorbell_camera/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you weren't moving you'd still be entitled to keep the camera.", "NTA (Not the Asshole)\n\nYour safety and the safety of your family should always come first. Given the high crime rate in your neighborhood and the incidents that have occurred in your building, it's completely reasonable to want to have a doorbell camera for added security. You have a valid concern for your well-being, especially since you're pregnant.\n\nYour new neighbors may feel uncomfortable with the camera capturing their front door, but they should also understand the context and the need for it in this particular neighborhood. You explained the situation to them and even mentioned the possibility of helping law enforcement if necessary. It's unfortunate that they didn't show much empathy or concern for your safety.\n\nYour friend's suggestion to take it down early to avoid drama is understandable, but it shouldn't be at the expense of compromising your family's safety, especially when you're only a few days away from moving out. You've already made the decision to move to a safer neighborhood, which shows that you're taking the necessary steps for your family's well-being.\n\nIn this situation, it's important to prioritize your safety and the safety of your family. You're not obligated to take down the camera just to appease your new neighbors, especially when you have legitimate reasons for keeping it up.", "NTA, your friend is an idiot.\nDo not take it down, they want it down for a reason.", "They are AH \u2018s . Leave it there until you move. When their door is open they have no expectation of privacy. When they are in the hallway they have no expectations of privacy. They are incorrect in my opinion.", "Nta - why are the new neighbours so concerned about if you can see their front door? That\u2019s more my concern. Are you they planning on illegal activities?", "NTA. You have it there for your safety. End of discussion. Don't take that camera down. For all you know, the new neighbors are the ones coordinating the break-ins and decided to move into the building to make it easier. I know that sounds like a bad movie plot, but stranger things have happened. Stay safe, and good luck with the move and new addition!!", "If they have nothing to hide, then it would be a non issue.\n\nSafety first!! NTA", "Fuck that.  Tell them you\u2019ll be taking it down in a week.", "Info: can you modify the camera\u2019s range (probably not the correct technical term). I ask because we got a doorbell with a camera when we moved (to the suburbs, ironically) and we had to adjust the settings a few times. It was picking up people walking down the street and it went off in the middle of the night once because of a raccoon (I legit almost died). Depending on the type of camera you have, you may be able to make it less sensitive.", "NTA. Leave a note telling them that you're moving out in a week and that the camera will go with you, just to avoid conflict in the next days.", "can you tell them you will take it downtime day you leave?", "NTAH, I'd have simply told them to go to hell! And anyone else that decided to stick their nose in it.", "You're NTA. Who cares what they think? You're moving in 8 days.", "INFO: OP, does your doorbell camera look out into a hallway of the apartment building? \n\nHave you ever gone to your building manager and asked if it was okay to put a doorbell camera up? \n\nYou are likely violating privacy laws and also the lease agreement you signed with your apartment. YTA. You\u2019re moving really soon, just take the thing down.", "NTA, what if they are not in fact your neighbours? You only have their word for it so far.", "Yup, I agree the new neighbour is doing something that could get them in trouble with cops. Why else would that get more insistent about OP removing the camera after they said about handing over the footage if something happens?", "Exactly where my mind went. Dealers.", "It\u2019s that the camera looks into the neighbor\u2019s home whenever the door is open.", "And my thought too was that, this is something you might come to expect when you move into an apartment building with the doors so close to each other. My instinct is that they are shady individuals, and they probably don't actually care what their neighbours think of them or vice versa. Keep the cameras up, a lot can happen in a week or less. Best to stay safe.", "Don't know if this applies where you are from: \"As the federal laws outline, you should have no legal issues in using a Ring doorbell, or another similar device, as long as it is recording a public area with no expectation of privacy.\"\n\nWatch out for privacy court cases. \n\nI fully understand your concern though. Rules are different for camera's only activated by moving. Or could you point it under an angle?", "It very well may be illegal. If OP is recording an apartment hallway, it typically is against privacy laws and is also against the apartment\u2019s lease agreement.", "Exactly this!", "Or sex trafficking or general vice crimes. Anything they don't want video evidence of. They're shady AF", "I thought did wasn't even legal. That you can't film others/other people's property", "And potentially dangerous AF too."]}
