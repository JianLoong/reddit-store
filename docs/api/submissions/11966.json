This would be a nice gift, except the package was addressed to my daughter and my mother. \n\nSome backstory, this is my mom\u2019s side of the family. My mother lives in California, we live in Texas and my extended family live in Iowa. I\u2019m 28 and this is my second child. \n\nAs a child, I would have said I was very close to my mom\u2019s side of the family, but growing up I\u2019ve slowly come to realize they don\u2019t actually give a shit about me. Up until last year, we all lived in Iowa within 30 minutes of each other. So if there was a holiday that they were hosting, they would invite my mom and expect her to invite me instead of reaching out to me themselves. I have lots of cousins from this Aunt and Uncle who are 10+ years older than me. My cousins will invite my mom to their kids activities and expect her to invite me (or not). I\u2019m always the last to know or be invited to anything. Not sure if this is because they still see me as the baby of the family (I\u2019m the youngest of all of the cousins, with a large age gap) or if they just truly don\u2019t want me around. They are nice to me when I do go to family events. \n\nGetting this package that has absolutely nothing to do with my mom (who again lives three states away from me) yet was addressed to her, just seems like the last straw to me. \n\nI have not done this yet, as I wanted to poll and see if this would be an asshole move, but I\u2019m very tempted to seal the package back up with an added letter detailing my feelings, and send it back to them. It\u2019s not something that they can return, since it\u2019s personalized, but I really don\u2019t want it as it\u2019s just going to be a reminder of how little they care about me. I\u2019m so confused why they seemingly refuse to acknowledge my existence. \n\nAm I overreacting?\n\nETA: For clarification, it came to my correct address in Texas, not sent to my mom. They just put her name on it for no reason. I and my mom have both reached out over the years to let them know that they can reach out to me directly for things. Even random questions they have about my family (my husband, myself and children) get asked to my mom instead of going through me. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a hard person to talk to, but maybe I just need to reach out to them again and be more direct with why they don\u2019t feel comfortable acknowledging me.", "created_utc": 1678460096, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nradp/aita_for_returning_a_personalized_baby_gift_to_my/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know that I am almost 30, and most of the family invites go to my mom/dad, who are supposed to invite me. I don't think it reflects how they feel about you in particular; they are just used to you being your mom's child. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is weird it was addressed to your mom/the baby. But I don't think it reaches to the level of returning it and having an argument. You can always mention it to your mom, and see if she has an idea why they posted it that way. It might get to them secondhand that it was a weird move, and they might correct their behavior. It might not. But I don't think this particular move is worth a fight.", "Feelings are feelings, so no judgment there. Acting on the feelings to punish someone, including your child  seems like YTA territory.

Both sides of my family pretty much invite my mom or dad to stuff and one parent relays the message. I've never felt slighted.

Really emphasize the I. then leave it alone.\n\nThat all aside.  I'm on your side.  My husband is having a very strained relationship with his mother lately.  He's broken down because she just doesn't tell him anything, and it leaves him feeling like no one likes him.  Most recently, a big group message went out to the entire extended family about the birth of his sisters child.  Husband found out while passing his dad on the way to the bathroom at work...the next day.  We are officially trying to distance ourselves and have jokingly said we'll be petty and move 3 provinces away and not tell her until we have left.  Also have joked saying we will let her know a week after we have a child.  Not before.  We aren't actually that petty but you get the picture. \n\nSo while this isn't the biggest deal as many might think, its the divorce over the dirty dishes.  You reach a breaking point over the disrespect and disregard for your very existence.  I wouldn't put up with it either.

Sending the non-returnable gift back would only make your family more hesitant to contact you personally and you'd lose the pillow case to remember your daughter's birth by.  At least in my culture it's quite normal to reach people through their parents, so there is a chance your family doesn't know they're doing something wrong.", "The invite thing isn\u2019t the issue, it was just to add context to the ever growing list of ways they will go out of their way to not acknowledge me directly. For example, they will ask my mother questions relating to me/my husband/children that my mom will then have to ask me because\u2026she\u2019s not me so doesn\u2019t know every detail of my life. If they would just reach out directly to me, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. It\u2019s not about wanting to be special, my mom and I have both asked that if they want me at events, they reach out to me directly as my mom has forgotten to tell me about things multiple times. Wouldn\u2019t be an issue if they reached out directly. The gift has nothing to do with my mom, my mom does not live with me and did not have this baby. If it were an \u201cI love my grandma\u201d shirt then sure, but it\u2019s not. It came to my house, addressed to my daughter and my mom, but not me. If we\u2019re addressing it to everyone involved, I\u2019d think my name would be on it too. You\u2019re right that they didn\u2019t have to send me a gift and at this point I wish they wouldn\u2019t have as it\u2019s only made me further feel like my family thinks I don\u2019t exist. If that makes me ungrateful then so be it.", "YTA\n\nThis is such a super normal thing in larger Midwest families. No one cares one bit about how an invite is made and it is absolutely is meaningless. People are being kind and extending invitations efficiently. This would be such a confusing and hostile move. Be grateful for what sounds like a nice gift. \n\nI'm 50. I still get cards sent to my mom's house addressed to me. Because people lose track of addresses or whatever. It's not a big deal. \n\nI highly doubt all the older cousins are receiving way more elaborate invitites to events. \n\nYou are making a giant mountain out of a molehill.", "NTA. This is weird af.", "Do they have your address? Is there a chance they might have send it to the address they know with the expectation that it finds the right person. Also its addressed to your daughter and not you, so if she wants to, she can return the gift but not you on her behalf unless you are overreacting.

She can send a thank you note.", "NAH. I get why you are irritated but they probably are not malicious. In my family, the cousins who are anywhere from like 25-45, are all spread out. So it is normal for people to reach out to aunts and uncles.

It was for her not me and she\u2019s offended", "This seems like a pretty big reaction to a very minor error. They bought and sent a thoughtful gift; they sent it to the correct address. It's weird that they addressed it to your mom, but it's hard to understand why you are taking that so personally? \n\nINFO Do you reach out to each of them to develop a closer relationship? Or is that burden only on them? If you make an effort to reach out to them individually and show interest in and engagement with each of their lives, then it is very fair that you are hurt by the lack of reciprocated care. Sending back the gift seems like an overreaction to me, but you may want to stop investing as much in these relationships. If you do not make the same effort with them that you are expecting from them, then you are fairly getting back what you put into these relationships, and your frustration with them is misplaced.", "YTA. It\u2019s a two way street. Where are all the invites you are putting to them individually? Your mom likely maintains the relationship with her extended family so invites go through her.\n\nYou want a friend? BE THE FRIEND! Same applies to these extended familial relationships.

I assume it\u2019s just more comfortable for them to talk to their siblings than to their nieces and nephews, which is pretty understandable.

I\u2019m talking about things that mom may not even attend, since they are for the kids. \n\nSince mom lives several states away, then why address the gift to her?", "YWBTA in my opinion it's not that serious. So what if you're not close. It makes sense especially since you're at least 10 years younger then them. You're probably right they still think of you just as your mom's child. But what does that have to do with the baby gift? You're acting like their gift is a lie or something, is just a baby gift not a testament or measure of love", "YWBTA. \n\nJust keep the pillowcase. Or throw it away if you\u2019re too annoyed about it. Don\u2019t waste your time shipping it back.  Not worth confronting over this. \n\nYeah, this sucks. No idea what their problem is. Please just ignore them. Weird stuff. I would go Low Contact / No Contact. \n\nStrange stuff.", "my family is very large and usually for invites the siblings mother and her siblings) tell each other the plans and my mother tells her kids.  This is not a big deal to me and I work at a baby store and we send gifts addressed to the newborn all the time .  I don\u2019t know why your moms name is on there but i wouldn\u2019t take offense- they sent your child a nice gift and i would keep it.", "So you were always invited to events where they were nice to you, and they send you personalized gifts. You just don\u2019t like the delivery method of either. YTA. I have a large family and have moved around a bit so I am treated similarly. I may visit someone who had held a gift for me from someone else because they weren\u2019t sure when I was visiting or what my last address was. I think it\u2019s sweet, and am grateful for the thought. I traveled to a family event I wasn\u2019t explicitly invited to but heard about and was able to make last minute, and it was awesome. Grow up.", "What a strange thing for them to do. I don't blame you at all for feeling upset and insulted - it was an upsetting and insulting thing for them to do. They know your name, they presumably know how to spell it, so why do they keep doing this? It's so bizarre, I wonder if there's some family secret they've been keeping from you that justifies them treating you like you aren't part of the family?\n\nSomeone else suggested writing a thank you to their mother, but you could also tell them that the package nearly wasn't opened, since it was addressed to the wrong person, and you very nearly sent it on to the addressed recipient, who lives a few states away. Make it very clear that you have noticed how they don't acknowledge your existence, and they're coming across as petty jerks.\n\nNTA, though don't actually return it, there are other more effective responses short of escalation.", "NTA. I\u2019d seal it and forward it to your mom, since the package IS addressed to her. Their refusal to clearly and directly communicate with you is strange. If truly cared about you, they\u2019d show you the same care and consideration they show the rest of your family. The present seems to be for the sake of appearances.", "NTA. I might just mail the package to my mom and send a quick text to the senders saying they accidentally sent something to your mom at your address. But, they don\u2019t have to worry because you forwarded it along so they didn\u2019t have to bother with fixing their mistake. No need to thank you for taking time out of your day as a busy and sleep deprived new mom to run to the post office. It\u2019s what family does for the people they care about.", "YTA", "They're not cold, even less offensive towards you, just seem oblivious of your existence as an adult independent from your mother. They're just stuck in stupid habits. \n\nSending back the gift with an angry or passive- agressive letter would be overreacting imo. Stuff the pillow case in the back of a closet, give it to a charity, or give it to your mother, with a joke about her family becoming senile and confusing you with her. Maybe it'll get back to them in a way they can understand.", "Listen, I have a terrible, passive-aggressive relationship with my MIL. However, everytime her extended family has an event, she (and sometimes one of her relatives) reaches out to me so I can tell my husband (her son) and our two adult kids. Why? I'm not sure. I can definitively see them doing that when my kids have their own families. \n\nMy kids have expressed many times how annoying this is, and have not acknowledged certain invitations as they were not invited personally. My husband is just grateful to get one less call and goes to everything. \n\nI get your frustration. But don't send the gift back, please.", "YWBTA, Honestly that's how it works in my family, we're a big family and if I'm throwing a party or anything at all I'll ask my mom to invite her family or i'll invite some cousins and ask them to also let their mom/ sister/ son or whoever know. If everyone in my family only came to things if they got a personal invite, half the people wouldn't come, we function by this \"spread the word\" dynamic and it's just what makes sense to us. I don't think it's any kind of  personal slight at all, particularly since you gave no other indication of being disrespected. I think it's just easier for them especially if they have a closer relationship to her than you. My dad's family is the same way, they'll send a package for \"joe\" but really it's presents for me/my siblings", "Possibly call them up and ask why your mother\u2019s package was sent to your house? When they say that it\u2019s for the you/baby, ask them to please address it properly and that it makes you feel uncomfortable when they contact your mother instead of you.", "Or mail it to mom and then when she receives it, just play dumb and say you didn't want to open someone else's mail.", "\\^\\^\n\nThis is good.", "This is what I was thinking too. Or I\u2019ll text my aunts and uncles and tell them to be sure to tell their kids, grandkids, etc. even though they addressed to OPs mom, they made the effort to send a personalized gift.", "I like the idea of addressing a thank you note to *their* mother, at their address, telling her to thank them for the lovely personalized gift. It gets your point across without you being an AH in any way.", "Just pretend you didn\u2019t open it.  It\u2019s a federal offense to open mail addressed to others.  Your mother is not around. And the little one does not yet know how to use her hands for anything practical. So I guess it will just have to wait :)", "I have experienced similar to you with my dad's family growing up and I think you should start addressing things directly as they happen. In this case, I would do what the other poster suggested and text or call to express confusion that you received a package at your address but it was addressed to your mom who doesn't live there. Let them give you their dumb reasoning and then tell them how you feel. That it makes you feel erased when they don't address things to you, it hurts your feelings, etc. They may be receptive to this and contrite when hearing directly from you that they're hurting you.", "Make sure to thank their mother for the thoughtful gift.", "You could also send it back as \" undeliverable person not at this address\".", "That info was posted after my comment.", "You've never heard of someone saying 'hey, Melissa has a soccer game on Saturday, when you talk to Kim let her know?'\n\nYou never heard of families saying we are watching the football game on Saturday and you guys are welcome to come by - tell Susan and Blake they are welcome to come too. \n\nAll those scenarios warranted one on one invitations directly to each invitee? \n\nYou never witnessed two older sisters in the family having a chat and asking how their new grandbaby is doing? Surely anyone asked that would answer and not say 'you need to call the new mom directly'.", "Passive aggressive behavior is a bedrock principle of a polite take down. They are being kind but rude.", "Whatever you say sweetheart.", "It doesn't make sense to address it to Mom. But not making sense doesn't equal some giant slight. Or a super meaningful attack. \n\nIt might be a simple mistake. People do make innocent mistakes."]}
