This would be a nice gift, except the package was addressed to my daughter and my mother. \n\nSome backstory, this is my mom\u2019s side of the family. My mother lives in California, we live in Texas and my extended family live in Iowa. I\u2019m 28 and this is my second child. \n\nAs a child, I would have said I was very close to my mom\u2019s side of the family, but growing up I\u2019ve slowly come to realize they don\u2019t actually give a shit about me. Up until last year, we all lived in Iowa within 30 minutes of each other. So if there was a holiday that they were hosting, they would invite my mom and expect her to invite me instead of reaching out to me themselves. I have lots of cousins from this Aunt and Uncle who are 10+ years older than me. My cousins will invite my mom to their kids activities and expect her to invite me (or not). I\u2019m always the last to know or be invited to anything. Not sure if this is because they still see me as the baby of the family (I\u2019m the youngest of all of the cousins, with a large age gap) or if they just truly don\u2019t want me around. They are nice to me when I do go to family events. \n\nGetting this package that has absolutely nothing to do with my mom (who again lives three states away from me) yet was addressed to her, just seems like the last straw to me. \n\nI have not done this yet, as I wanted to poll and see if this would be an asshole move, but I\u2019m very tempted to seal the package back up with an added letter detailing my feelings, and send it back to them. It\u2019s not something that they can return, since it\u2019s personalized, but I really don\u2019t want it as it\u2019s just going to be a reminder of how little they care about me. I\u2019m so confused why they seemingly refuse to acknowledge my existence. \n\nAm I overreacting?\n\nETA: For clarification, it came to my correct address in Texas, not sent to my mom. They just put her name on it for no reason. I and my mom have both reached out over the years to let them know that they can reach out to me directly for things. Even random questions they have about my family (my husband, myself and children) get asked to my mom instead of going through me. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a hard person to talk to, but maybe I just need to reach out to them again and be more direct with why they don\u2019t feel comfortable acknowledging me.", "created_utc": 1678460096, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nradp/aita_for_returning_a_personalized_baby_gift_to_my/", "score": 476, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know that I am almost 30, and most of the family invites go to my mom/dad, who are supposed to invite me. I don't think it reflects how they feel about you in particular; they are just used to you being your mom's child. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is weird it was addressed to your mom/the baby. But I don't think it reaches to the level of returning it and having an argument. You can always mention it to your mom, and see if she has an idea why they posted it that way. It might get to them secondhand that it was a weird move, and they might correct their behavior. It might not. But I don't think this particular move is worth a fight.", "Feelings are feelings, so no judgment there. Acting on the feelings to punish someone, including your child  seems like YTA territory.

Both sides of my family pretty much invite my mom or dad to stuff and one parent relays the message. I've never felt slighted.

Really emphasize the I. then leave it alone.\n\nThat all aside.  I'm on your side.  My husband is having a very strained relationship with his mother lately.  He's broken down because she just doesn't tell him anything, and it leaves him feeling like no one likes him.  Most recently, a big group message went out to the entire extended family about the birth of his sisters child.  Husband found out while passing his dad on the way to the bathroom at work...the next day.  We are officially trying to distance ourselves and have jokingly said we'll be petty and move 3 provinces away and not tell her until we have left.  Also have joked saying we will let her know a week after we have a child.  Not before.  We aren't actually that petty but you get the picture. \n\nSo while this isn't the biggest deal as many might think, its the divorce over the dirty dishes.  You reach a breaking point over the disrespect and disregard for your very existence.  I wouldn't put up with it either.

Sending the non-returnable gift back would only make your family more hesitant to contact you personally and you'd lose the pillow case to remember your daughter's birth by.  At least in my culture it's quite normal to reach people through their parents, so there is a chance your family doesn't know they're doing something wrong.", "The invite thing isn\u2019t the issue, it was just to add context to the ever growing list of ways they will go out of their way to not acknowledge me directly. For example, they will ask my mother questions relating to me/my husband/children that my mom will then have to ask me because\u2026she\u2019s not me so doesn\u2019t know every detail of my life. If they would just reach out directly to me, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. It\u2019s not about wanting to be special, my mom and I have both asked that if they want me at events, they reach out to me directly as my mom has forgotten to tell me about things multiple times. Wouldn\u2019t be an issue if they reached out directly. The gift has nothing to do with my mom, my mom does not live with me and did not have this baby. If it were an \u201cI love my grandma\u201d shirt then sure, but it\u2019s not. It came to my house, addressed to my daughter and my mom, but not me. If we\u2019re addressing it to everyone involved, I\u2019d think my name would be on it too. You\u2019re right that they didn\u2019t have to send me a gift and at this point I wish they wouldn\u2019t have as it\u2019s only made me further feel like my family thinks I don\u2019t exist. If that makes me ungrateful then so be it.", "YTA\n\nThis is such a super normal thing in larger Midwest families. No one cares one bit about how an invite is made and it is absolutely is meaningless. People are being kind and extending invitations efficiently. This would be such a confusing and hostile move. Be grateful for what sounds like a nice gift. \n\nI'm 50. I still get cards sent to my mom's house addressed to me. Because people lose track of addresses or whatever. It's not a big deal. \n\nI highly doubt all the older cousins are receiving way more elaborate invitites to events. \n\nYou are making a giant mountain out of a molehill.", "NTA. This is weird af.", "Do they have your address? Is there a chance they might have send it to the address they know with the expectation that it finds the right person. Also its addressed to your daughter and not you, so if she wants to, she can return the gift but not you on her behalf unless you are overreacting.

She can send a thank you note.", "NAH. I get why you are irritated but they probably are not malicious. In my family, the cousins who are anywhere from like 25-45, are all spread out. So it is normal for people to reach out to aunts and uncles.

It was for her not me and she\u2019s offended", "This seems like a pretty big reaction to a very minor error. They bought and sent a thoughtful gift; they sent it to the correct address. It's weird that they addressed it to your mom, but it's hard to understand why you are taking that so personally? \n\nINFO Do you reach out to each of them to develop a closer relationship? Or is that burden only on them? If you make an effort to reach out to them individually and show interest in and engagement with each of their lives, then it is very fair that you are hurt by the lack of reciprocated care. Sending back the gift seems like an overreaction to me, but you may want to stop investing as much in these relationships. If you do not make the same effort with them that you are expecting from them, then you are fairly getting back what you put into these relationships, and your frustration with them is misplaced.", "YTA. It\u2019s a two way street. Where are all the invites you are putting to them individually? Your mom likely maintains the relationship with her extended family so invites go through her.\n\nYou want a friend? BE THE FRIEND! Same applies to these extended familial relationships.

I assume it\u2019s just more comfortable for them to talk to their siblings than to their nieces and nephews, which is pretty understandable.

I ask because I\u2019m not particularly close with my cousins, if I were to invite them to something I\u2019d reach out to my aunt to pass along the invitation\u2026maybe, now that I think about it I\u2019d probably have my dad invite them, and he\u2019d reach out to my aunt and she to my cousins. Being related means literally nothing. It doesn\u2019t make you automatically close, could be they just don\u2019t feel comfortable reaching out to you as you\u2019re effectively a stranger they\u2019re obligated to care about. Doesn\u2019t mean they hate you, my one cousin has like 3 kids\u2026I think, I\u2019ve never sent them anything, she doesn\u2019t hate me, and I have kidney failure and am on dialysis and she\u2019s never reached out to me, I don\u2019t hate her. And we only live about two hours away, not bad blood, just indifferent, I guess. \n\nHonestly if she randomly made a big deal about me sending something in my aunt\u2019s name to give to her, all it would accomplish is to make sure I don\u2019t send them anything in the future to avoid drama.", "Is your neighbour my grandpa?? \n\nI walk into my grandpas house and its \u201cHi aunt\u2019s name, no, mom\u2019s name, no pet thats been dead for about 30 year\u2019s name, *Slew of random, made up explicits followed by a second of silence* no, Honeycomb0000\u201d", "Ha! Sounds like they\u2019re related! \n\nThe funniest thing is she almost got it right the first time. My mother & I had the same first name but we went by different nicknames.", "I come from a large family. Invites are phone tree style and your mom is the one responsible for giving you the details like hey Brittany\u2019s birthday is next month bbq at aunt Sandy\u2019s on the 11th to celebrate.", "I think when someone gifts your child something they worked hard to make and mail the proper response is \u201cThank you\u201d", "I think it depends how much you have discussed this issue with them. If you never brought it up then you'd be TA for doing it in this manner.", "I would say YWBTA. \n\nIm from Texas. To me this seems like something they are doing it as a habit and not maliciously. Like when you, or anyone, was little they would tell the parents and then everyone would be there. As you grow up and no longer need your parents to be invited to family events, things get lost and some people just think the parents will invite them. Add on old age and boom. Even more reason to forget or get mixed up.\n\nThis is a molehill and mountain situation.", "You feel how you feel so I\u2019m going to say NTA. However I can say if this happened to me there would be a 99.9% chance they couldn\u2019t remember my name (vs another cousin - it\u2019s a lot of us) . And for me personally, I would love it if my extended family filtered everything through my mom. LOL!\n\nETA: including your mom\u2019s name was their weird way of letting your mom know they sent a gift for her grandkid. For some generations, that\u2019s important.", "NTA it\u2019s technically illegal to open it. Write \u201cReturn To Sender\u201d in big red letters with a note that says \u201cThe person this is addressed to does NOT live. Please do NOT send Mail addressed to her here.\u201d or if you\u2019re feeling really petty send it to your mom and tell her you got a pkg for her sent to your address and send it to her.", "Write \"Not at this address\" on the envelope and drop it in the mail. Do the same anytime someone mails something to you addressed to your mom. If your mom is on your side on this issue, ask her to do likewise if they ask her questions about your family. Even if she knows the answer, she should always reply \"you'll need to ask (you)\".\n\nNTA. It might seem like an overreaction to this one gift, but that's not what you're reacting to - you're reacting to years of this dismissive and rude behavior.", "Call them and say \"hey, I got a package addressed to my mom.. do you want me to send it to her??\" And see what their explanation is \ud83d\ude02 NTA but sending it back is kinda excessive in my opinion.", "YTA, your choosing to take an apparently normal quirk in your family as a personal slight. That's wholly on you, they aren't excluding you they just didn't write the invites as you would prefer!", "YTA why be so petty? what does your Mom say?  It\u2019s not worth the fight. Never bend down to meet your foes.", "I\u2019d forward it to my mom if I was you and tell her here you got a gift make sure you send a thank you note.", "OP says both her and her mom have tried to talk to them but everything still continues.", "Yeah\u2026I don\u2019t get people who just love figuring out new ways to feel slighted.  I try to do the opposite and just kind of assume most people mean well.  Having someone be this bitter about how they were invited to Aunt Bertha\u2019s party or Christmas Eve or whatever\u2026it\u2019s exhausting.", "She probably wants questions involving her life (questions about her, her husband, & kids) to be asked directly to her as she would know the answers better than her mom who is constantly asked. Or maybe she wants them to respect her and her mom when they tell them they\u2019re uncomfortable with what that side of the family is doing.", "We kept the same structure of letting people know,  to the point that my parents tell the rest of the family even when my sister is hosting.  It's weird,  but it just works.", "My aunt took trip with me, just me, for around three or four days. She never called me by my name correctly on the first try ever, I was always the fourth or fifth. She even got her dogs name in there at least twice!\n\nI mean, it wasn\u2019t malicious, she does it all the time with everyone in my family. Her brain just can\u2019t grab the right name on the first try. It\u2019s always the third try or later. \n\nSo she\u2019ll go like, \u201cLauren, no Andy, no Jane,\u201d before finally saying my name, usually louder and with more emphasis because she finally got it.", "My mum does that to me all the time, I think she goes through all the families names before she gets the right one, mind you,  she does that to everyone in the family", "I honestly think it\u2019s cute when people do this. My grandma sometimes does it to me, and calls me by my mom\u2019s name. It\u2019s just because she\u2019s spent 48 years saying that name and only 28 with me.\n\nI personally do it, too. But mine is my ADHD and just my mouth working faster than my brain. I used to call my best friend my step sister\u2019s name and vice versa and they both thought it was funny.", "Was thinking this too. I definitely overreacted about a lot of things with all those pregnant/ postpartum hormones as well"]}
