When I (26F) was born, my grandma\u2019s disgust was so blantant that my parents went NC with my paternal grandparents. When I was nine, mom died in a car crash. After that, my dad went in contact with his parents again, and after a while he brought me with him to family dinners at my grandparents. My grandpa quite liked me, but my grandma mostly tolerated me, and her comments always made me feel like I wasn\u2019t seen as equal as my cousins bc I take after my mom. She said she didn\u2019t like my mom bc of her personality and opinions, but I think it had to do with my mom being Asian too.\n\nFor years I just went along for my dad\u2019s shake, bc it was like a couple times a year for me (dad visited them more often), but I stopped going when I was of age, bc I realised grandma wasn\u2019t going to change her opinion of me no matter what I did and I was tired of trying. My dad respected my wishes not to talk to them anymore, but he kept updating them on me and I\u2019m fine with this, bc grandpa kinda cares about it (especially since I did in college a degree similar to what he worked as) and grandma didn\u2019t care enough to hurt me over it.\n\nNow, grandma had terminal cancer, and she died a few weeks ago. Mid-November my dad told me she had a few days to live, and that she was remorseful about how poorly she had treated me and she wanted to talk to me before she died. I decided to visit her. She praised me on my achievements in college, and in my professional career. It was quite touching, not going to lie I got a bit emotional. Then she asked me if I could forgive her for how she had treated me all those years. And I went mad. \n\nI thought about mom and I got very upset and I told grandma it was too late, and that she should\u2019ve done better before when mom was alive. She started crying and I walked away. I didn\u2019t visit her again, but I went to her funeral \u2014 maybe that\u2019s cruel of me but I felt like I needed to make sure she was actually dead and put underground. In the funeral, my grandpa apologised for my grandma\u2019s behavior and for letting it hurt me. I told him I forgave him for his part in this ordeal. He promised he\u2019d do better now on and maybe I\u2019ll visit him over the holidays.\n\nIt\u2019s been weeks and I just can\u2019t keep thinking about that last time when I visited grandma, and how I got mad at her when she was such a frail old woman, and I feel guilty. She was very religious so maybe it felt like the difference between going to hell or heaven for her \u2014 I don\u2019t care much about it, bc I am not religious, so it was just a few words for me to say. I feel like an asshole for acting like that now that I can think more clearly about it, bc she did praise me and have nice words about me, but at that moment it felt the right thing to do.", "created_utc": 1702811576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kf6k3/aita_for_insulting_my_26f_grandmother_80sf_on_her/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Soft NTA because I see this as a way of getting closure but you need to also see it this way as well. Many people have regrets on their deathbed, perhaps she was only trying to clear her conscience before she met her maker. Fortunately for her, it\u2019s not her fault you didn\u2019t forgive her. But if you\u2019re at peace with what you\u2019ve said, let the resentment go or you may just have regrets of your own when it\u2019s your time. She\u2019s not around to hurt you anymore and this resentment isn\u2019t going to serve you any longer. Visit your grandpa for the holidays and maintain a relationship with him in his old age. Doing this should make it clear to you whether or not you\u2019ve got closure from your grandma. Losing your mom at such a young age is traumatic, even without a racist grandma. Please do what you can to heal.", "It's not a question of if you were an asshole, it's a question of how do you live with what happened. Different people will have different opinions on this based on their lives, their upbringing, their moral compass and all sorts of variables. \n\nWill everyone telling you that you weren't an asshole make you feel better? Will everyone telling you that you were an asshole make you feel worse? \n\nAt the end of the day, you're the one who has to live with it. You need to decide within yourself if you went too far or not, and if you did, how you intend to cope with it. Maybe with time you can forgive yourself, or maybe you'll need to take more active steps to make yourself feel like you have earned that forgiveness.\n\nOr maybe, on reflection, you'll decide you don't feel guilty and this was just a passing blip of conscientiousness. \n\nNone of us have the right to judge you, only you can do that.", "NOT THE ASSHOLE!\n\nYou were incredibly gracious and generous to talk with her at all. If she was a decent human being, and truly felt sorry, the  the apology would come with *no expectation* of forgiveness. How the hell is an apology genuine if you then ask to be forgiven!? your grandmother sounds like a horrible intolerant person who treated her family badly for bad reasons. Your point about her being religious and wanting to get into heaven lines up percectly with her stridently asking to be forgiven. the kind words she offered you were probably payment towards her debt in purgatory of whatever. Sounds like she was a coward too.", "NTA. I agree with you - it was too late. To behave like that towards you and your mom (and probably other people as well) shows that she is basically not a nice person. Any decent person would not act like that.", "NTA\n\nnever feel remorseful for telling the truth.\n\nWhat she did and said hurt your Mum and You. She asked a question could you forgive her and you gave her the honest answer.\n\nShe only repented on her deathbed before she supposedly went to meet her maker, she should have done this when your Mum was still around!\n\nEdit: Spelling and added a couple of words", "Commenting because I expect a similar thing to happen when an abusive grandmother is on her own deathbed. You\u2019re NTA. She needed to hear just how much pain she caused you and your mother. Also, a sorry just before you die isn\u2019t really an apology when a religious person is involved. If they were truly sorry for their actions they would\u2019ve apologized long ago. As it stands, this was just another thing in a very long line of manipulative bullshit from her for you, and you were right to do what you did. \n\nI heard this line somewhere and loved it: Sometimes things are too terrible to forgive. \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, try to let go of your anger and hurt over what this woman did to you. Good luck.", "NTA but you may still regret this, sincere apologies are a big deal. However you had a tough break with your paternal grandma and it doesn't sound like you've been well supported working it through. It's a sad story. Your anger took over & you didn't respond like you might have done if you had bigger reserves of calm. People like your grandma generally don't end up so closed off without experiencing some of that themselves. Is the stunted plant to blame for not being watered?\n\nYou went to the funeral to \"make sure she was dead\" so the anger persists. That's natural. Anger is like rot in structural wood though, it's really better to deal with it than try to live alongside it. Your grandma was very unkind to you because of blocks in her own life; she received bad inputs or at least never the right ones. Do you want to carry your grandma's fuck-ups into the future by holding anger over them?\n\nSurely better to forgive your grandma, like she asked. It will do you good you won't realise you needed. A lot of people live and die nasty & stupid. In the grand scheme of things its pitiable. It's also not wholly on them. Humans try to reach a good life like salmon smashing upstream; there's kinda no sense in blaming the ones that don't make it.", "Definitely NTA\n\nUnlike what Christianity says, you don't get absolution on your deathbed for the sins you commit against your loved ones.\n\nStay strong. You deserve better.", "NTA. You've probably needed to express your feelings to your grandma for a long time, and it's just unfortunate that the only chance you had to do that was on her deathbed. However if you never said it to her, all that anger you felt would still be there and would continue to be there. You needed closure and this was it.", "NTA\n\nYou articulated years of unresolved hurt because that's how you felt in the moment.\n\nThat's totally understandable.\n\nYou can't change what happened.\n\nAll you can do is change your feelings & perceptions on it if you choose/are able to.\n\nPlease get some therapy if you can to work through this & heal. You don't deserve to be or feel unhappy over this. It may also help you in your relationship with your grandpa.", "NTA - your Grandma made your mom\u2019s life and your life intolerable. Death bed apologies are just her trying to make sure she gets into heaven. Good for you telling her she\u2019s always been an AH. Actions have consequences. Put the hateful old witch out of your mind and have a great life with those that truly love you.", "How you treat people in life MATTERS... repenting on your deathbed with a sudden clarity of mind in your weakest state, is not the solution to the harms you give out, and can't erase the damage you do to the people you're about to leave behind... you don't owe her a shred of guilt.\n\nNTA", "NTA we\u2019ll never know if her apology was sincere considering she wants to do it at her last moments which often abusive relatives attempt simply because they want to go out with a clear conscience not often repentant. If she was doesn\u2019t mean she was entitled to forgiveness it\u2019s harsh but she should attempted to make amends a long time ago.", "You really shouldn't carry so much hate and anger around with you. You're going to have to learn to let it go. Was it nice to insult a dying old lady? No. Was it the right thing to do? Also no. You have grief that you are not dealing with. You should seek some help, so you can get peace in your life. Holding onto this is not good for you. NTA because you acted out of hurt, but seriously, seek some professional help so you can heal.", "the golden rule is a good rule.\n\nIf given the choice, be kind. \n\nAs is the one about if you don't have something nice to say.\n\nI am sorry about your many challenges.  You sound like an earnest person.\n\nTherapy might help.", "My personal belief is that it\u2019s never too late to accept an apology and allow someone to be a better person, though that doesn\u2019t mean they deserve to be a part of your life. \n\nIt sounds like you never confronted your grandma about her mistreatment of you and you took this opportunity to vent all that you had bottled up over the years. Unfortunately, you\u2019ve discovered that it didn\u2019t bring the peace of mind and satisfaction you had hoped, because of the circumstances. \n\nSlight YTA. But you aren\u2019t bound by it forever. Your grandma was a small woman who realized her error too late. In a few months, take your grandfather to visit her grave and leave a modest bouquet of flowers signifying forgiveness. Do this for yourself so you can stop stressing about whether you were an asshole our not.", "kick them while they are down is not a good thing, it wasn't about her being a villian but about you as a person, then visiting her funeral on top of that comes of as hypocrisy . Why visit a villians funeral,i don't see the point", "Soft YTA. The time to express all those feelings was years ago, when she was in good health and could take it. This woman was on her deathbed and showed true remorse. What did you accomplish by unloading on her? She's dead now, and you will have to live with the memory of what you said for the rest of your life.\n\nI'm not saying you're not justified in feeling the way you do. You had every reason to dislike the woman. But if you felt like it was going to be an ugly scene, you should have just declined to speak with her. She was suffering enough without being verbally attacked over things she did years ago and can't go back and change.\n\nI sympathize with the difficulty this situation presented for you. It's understandable you felt upset about the way your mother was treated, and maybe you felt like it would have been disloyal to your mother to accept your grandma's apology. There are many reasons why you did what you did. A lot of people would do the same thing, as you can see from all the comments on this post.\n\nAt this point, I think you should forgive yourself and just resolve to learn from that experience. You can't undo it. At least you know your grandma did feel remorse, and maybe you can find some peace in that.", "YTA . You were too much a coward to confront her in life . So you confronted her on her death bed . That\u2019s a very low act", "You already know the answer to this. You feel it.", "[deleted]", "NTA - Hindsight is 20/20 - you got closure, and lots of times people don\u2019t. Deathbed closure isn\u2019t really for you  - that\u2019s between her and her God. My advice is put the guilt down if you can - you\u2019d probably be able to continue to build a relationship with your grandfather who is really very lonely right now. That\u2019s pretty cool", "I would've done the same. You dont owe anyone amends. She had years to apologize. I hope she felr guilt at the end. NTA", "NTA\n\nI think the fact that you feel guilty about being harsh (but truthful) to someone who has never done anything positive for you, shows that you are a decent person.\n\nShe had more than two decades to feel guilty for how she treated your parents and you and she. did. not. She only decided to apologize when on her deathbed. Maybe it was genuine, maybe she just wanted extra points for her heaven reward program. If it was the former she would have understood and accepted your reaction. \n\nMaybe you needed to confront her at least once and unload everything for you to be ready to forgive. Which you can still do if you want to; it is still as meaningfull as if she were alive. It is about the person granting forgiveness not about the person receiving it.\n\nAll the best to you and I hope your relationship with your grandfather keeps improving.", "NTA - I understand why you feel guilty but give yourself a break. Apologies are what\u2019s owed\u2026.not forgiveness. And even when forgiveness is granted, it has to be on the timeline of the person who was wronged. Your grandma should have apologized to you, because it was owed. But she should have said that she hopes that you\u2019ll be able to forgive her in time, and she will understand if you aren\u2019t able to do so.", "NTA \n\nYou don't have to forgive anyone. You don't have to forgive someone just because they are dying. \n\nJust because someone is dying, they don't suddenly become a good person. Your grandmother mistreated your mother, and in turn, she mistreated you. I am so sorry because you didn't deserve that. Your father should have grown a spine and protected you. He is the person you need to talk to because he is a great disappointment. You deserve an apology.", "NTA.\n\nWas it harsh? Probably. You let your anger get a hold of you instead of remaining clear headed. Does that make you an asshole? I don't think so.\n\nShe was manipulating you in her last moments. Probably she expected that being on the verge of death would make you forgive her, and that is not a genuine gesture. You stuck to your guts, and that takes bravery. Now you're saying she didn't even apologise, so you owe her absolutely nothing.\n\nFor your future, I hope you can make peace with yourself over this situation, and can forgive yourself when you feel ready. Kindly, I think you should talk to a therapist over all the anger you hold against your grandmother, especially now that she's gone, if you hadn't done that already. It's understandable where it's coming from, but you can't let it rule and ruin your life. You deserve way better than this.

Reports back from those experiencing death are that it's a very intense time of significant change and experience. I think it's quite likely she felt remorse, with her deathbed perspective. But even without anybody asking, we should be able to forgive.", "You treat her as you find her. In the moment, trying to save her soul, at the very last minute... victim blame much?\n\nThe old bag could have apologised and left it at that... but instead she insisted the OP forgive her... there's no reason for OP to all of a sudden find a place in her heart for that. Bullshit.", "Remorse is not the same as apologizing. \n\nIt's your guilt that's haunting you. You can't take it back or change what you said, so you just need to move past it.", "Asking if you can forgive her is the equivalent of saying she was sorry. Someone who is not sorry does not ask for forgiveness. She was clearly trying to make amends with you.", "And you have all sorts of excuses you made up for why grandma was the way she was. OP has a right to be angry. OP will deal with those feelings when they are ready, and no one minute before. Grandma deserved the rage and it was good that OP was able to express their feelings instead of regretting leaving things unspoken. Those angry feelings will fade and OP will eventually feel better when things aren't so fresh and raw.", "You are assuming that she was trying to save her soul. We don\u2019t know that. Many non religious people try to make amends before they pass on. I love how you are calling a woman you never met names based on reading one side of the story on the internet. I have had many people deeply wrong me. I wouldn\u2019t treat them this way on their death bed because I wouldn\u2019t want to live with that negativity the rest of my life.", "I don't have excuses I have likely explanations. Kids are raised racist.\n\nI said OP's anger was understandable but that it will do her harm.\n\nGrandma is dead an OP is non-religious (so no after life I guess). The outburst achieved nothing, while being understandable. Regretting angry words left unsaid is better than regretting angry words said, I reckon. OP reports having spent weeks feeling guilty. Figures!\n\nAssholes cling to anger, ultimately. The grievance might be justified but the non-asshole move is to grow past it."]}
