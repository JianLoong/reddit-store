You\u2019re being hateful, openly, and sure you can - but it\u2019s AH\u2026I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s ok to play favourites as a parent. Let alone so openly.

(And living with parents is not the obligatory, it's just a popular choice. I simply answered your question as to why any of their sons may wanna live with them)\n\nIt honestly depends on the household and the country.

His kids grew up taking care of their grandfather. Grandpa thought it best that they actually move in, rather than live across town. And again, the grandchildren's lives revolved around school and managing their grandpa's small needs. \n\nGrandpa passed away and left his multimillion estate to the son who moved across country to be near him and the grandkids who hung out with him gladly and took care of him without expectation or complaint.\n\nThe rest of the family lost their minds when the will was read.

Anyway, I\u2019ve tried my entire life to be accepted and loved by my mom. I was used as an ATM financially and emotionally. I was very blinded by it all. COVID hit and she got it bad twice. I dropped my career, husband and kids to go be with her bc my brothers who live 5 Min  way either had the excuse of we have kids or we have work we can\u2019t. When she got better enough to talk she yelled at me that no one asked me to go. This happened 4 times. I\u2019m a dumb Ass as you can see. The 4th time I brought her with me bc she couldn\u2019t walk again covid stroke and brain hemorrhage. She insulted me every day then told my brothers I wasn\u2019t feeding her and kept her locked up. My brothers all said I was. A bad daughter and caretaker so I told them to take her then and told her to go with them since they  are perfect. Guess what? It was a NO from all of them. \n\nI flew her out last august First class to Italy - I went with her- again left my family for her bc she couldn\u2019t go alone.. Handed her my cc and all she managed to do the entire trip was call me a whore and tell me all I cared about was money. She kept making comments like \u201coh must be nice just to spend so much\u201d \u201coh you must be rich\u201d bla bla bla. But she was the one talking about it constantly. \n\nWe had a blow out fight when we got back and I haven\u2019t spoken to her since. I stopped giving her money too. I do pay for her cell phone but I stopped paying everything else. Why? Bc she takes advantage of me and encourages my brothers as well to use me as their ATM.

Not living with your parents comes with other benefits like freedom and free time.\n\nMy grandmother has six children and even more grandchildren.

My dad's parents never raised my dad (grandma was evil stepmom), but spoiled my dad's brothers rotten. Fast forward to now, my dad is the only son who still talks to them and sends money to them, my dad even paid off some of my uncle's gambling debt.\n\nBut we're supposed to take OP's words at face value here instead of bringing our own guesses into the situation; I don't think its wrong at all for OP to want to live with the son that she thinks will do things for her over the son that doesn't seem to offer anything to her."]}
