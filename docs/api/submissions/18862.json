You\u2019re being hateful, openly, and sure you can - but it\u2019s AH\u2026I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s ok to play favourites as a parent. Let alone so openly.

People are acting like the son is just getting a free house with no strings attached. It's an exchange - the son gets the house, the parent gets a caregiver. Of course it makes more sense to choose the son who has already shown a willingness to offer support and who he knows he can live peacefully alongside.\n\nIs it *perfectly* fair and equal? Maybe not. But honestly, I think anyone who has ever cared for an elderly parent long-term could tell you who is getting the better deal here. The amount of care required is likely to keep increasing over time, and if the person gets sick/injured at some point, it can become a huge time commitment and very emotionally draining.\n\nDoing all of that for a parent/in-law whose company you truly enjoy is a lot more rewarding than doing it because you're obligated to in exchange for housing - which just sounds miserable for both sides and would likely end with the older son stepping up anyway (except it won't be as convenient).\n\nTL;DR Regardless of what kind of parent OP was, throwing away a solid, realistic plan for receiving care in old age just to \"make up for the past\" isn't going to help anyone in the long run.
