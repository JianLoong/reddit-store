My elderly mother let my brother move in he could give to shits about her and his wife is awful. if anything, they make her miserable. I would do the same thing let the son that will take care of you move in don't feel guilty.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your home. If you are at a point in life where you need help, the son who is more help and more compatible is the better choice. \n\nI don\u2019t see this as favoritism. They are adults, neither has any right or claim to living in your house.", "Info:\n\n1. Why does your second son believe the older one is the favourite? Have you treated them fairly through life?\n\n2. Why do they both want to live with you when they're presumably capable adults, who have partners and family of their own?\n\n3. Will the son who moves in pay rent? If not, will you be balancing that by doing something equally generous for the other son?\n\nYou are entitled to live with people who will be the most pleasant housemates for you, but I have a feeling that the dynamic here is more complicated than just this one situation about living arrangements. Why does your younger son feel this way, and what had led up to that feeling?\n\nBecause if he's always felt second best, its no wonder he's resentful. Although barring the question around free rent, I can't imagine why he would want to live with you, if he feels that way.", "I can\u2019t believe all the y t a. Like who would want to share house with someone that will not be beneficial to you? Sons are both adults, there aren\u2019t anymore minors to be cuddled. They each choose their \u2018grave\u2019. \nNTA you didn\u2019t choose your favorite son, you choose the best situation for yourself. Someone that can chip in and help. My own brother lives in a similar situation as he helps my parents with heavy chores. It\u2019s beneficial to my parents and I am happy they can get help.", "NTA you had to choose one, correct? No room for both?  You picked the one who would make your life easier", "INFO: Is your older son going to pay rent? Would your younger son be willing to pay rent? Do you have room for both?", "NTA - I am assuming you are elderly?  If this is the case I will break from what others are saying with what I consider the obvious, you are up in years and would appreciate reliable people around during this time.    I cannot oppose this BUT I do oppose the status you gave your oldest with \"favorite\", not a good thing to do with children regardless of age.  If you left that ONE word out, I would bet you wouldnt have any negative comments from this page.  But unfortunately you did.", "They are both adults? Then they both know that past bad actions have future negative consequences.\n\nIts not favoritism when one of the adults is difficult to be around.\n\nSo, NAH. I can see you not wanting to be bothered. And I can see your other son thinking its perfectly fine to ask you if his family can move in too.", "NAH you have only room for one of you children, so you had to make a choice.", "NTA - this isn\u2019t favouritism you\u2019re choosing your older son because it\u2019s mutually beneficial for you both. No one is entitled to anything", "You are NTA for choosing the most compatible son(family) to live with but you are an ah for having a favourite child and making more effort to make memories with them than your other child", "NTA when deciding to live with people you should only live with people you actually get along with and want to spend time with.\n\nYou don\u2019t like on dil and their kids aren\u2019t interested in human interaction so why would you want to live with them?", "NTA, but just si it\u2019s slightly more fair for the younger sibling just have the elder sibling pay for something regularly, like utilities, or groceries. but it\u2019s your call still, they\u2019re both adults so you\u2019re not obligated to house both of them", "I'm torn here. If you've been favoring the older son their entire lives, it's no wonder the younger son turned out not to be as pleasant; he's simply living up to your expectations and a LOT of work needs to be done to remedy those toxic family dynamics.\n\nHOWEVER, it's also understandable not to want to live with people you don't get along with. \n\nMaybe offer family counseling and see where things go from there?", "NTA if your shitty people aren\u2019t going to want you around. Since one son is nice, the rest seem to be an asshole despite their upbringing.", "Ur house ur rules", "NTA- is there enough room for other son and his family to live there too?\n\nIf not just explain it to him how you have to us, it benefits you more and makes your life happier having the other son around whereas his presence would not bring the same benefits.\n\nMay be abit brutal but honesty is the best policy.\n\nTell him its not about favourites more about who respects you the most.", "What is with this stuck up comment section? NTA\n\nIts your house, you decide who lives with you. You don't NEED to let someone live with you.", "Yta - there is never a good reason to make favoritism so clear. Also obviously his family dislikes you\u2026 that\u2019s their dad and husband and you treat him like that?", "YTA. Maybe the fact that you call him your favourite son is causing the second one to feel a certain way?", "Im sorry but anytime a parent chooses one child over another they are an AH>", "YTA. \n\nReading the comments, you're in a position to let one, but not both, of your sons and their family come live with you. \n\nIt's obvious you do have a favorite, and favorite grandkids, and you're providing that help to your favorite child. \n\nWhile that's perfectly rational, that in and of itself makes you the AH. \n\nIf the son who was going to live with you was paying rent though, I would say NTA. But it's clear you're providing MASSIVE assistance to one of your children and not the other on the basis of which one you like more.", "YTA. You've probably treated them this way their entire life and at this point it's years of resentment built up. If you truly don't want to pick favorites, you either shouldn't have invited any of them, or get a space for both of them. Or even just let the two of them decide. Do you even love your younger son or do you wish your oldest was your only child?", "YTA for letting your favorite son and your favorite family live with you. All the reasons you listed are preferential.", "YTA. Even more so for all the comments in which you try to defend and make excuses for favoring your golden child. Get over yourself.", "AITA for \"only letting my favorite son live with me\"?\n\nYes\n\nYTA\n\nNo matter what reasons you put forward, you are still favoring one child over the other.", "NTA as it is your house. But think about what this will do to your relationship with your younger son. He will resent you and most likely go low contact or no contact with you. Be sure that you are prepared for the consequences. \nYou show blatant favoritism and it will have consequences", "YTA. First of all you have a favourite child. You obviously love you son and his family for what they do for you and that\u2019s extremely self centred. \n\nMaybe your other son and his family would help you more and want to be around you more if you didn\u2019t play favourites.", "YTA and I understand why your grandsons prefer their phones to you.", "> However my other son is not as thoughtful as my oldest, his sons prefer their phones to us and I simply dislike his wife\n\nYTA. You didn't even list any reasons why you shouldn't let your other son stay with you, just a general \"I don't like him that much\". Also, from you other sons remark it sounds like there's room for both but you only want one to stay with you.", "YTA", "YTA and you will never have a better relationship with your other son and his family if you push them away like this", "If you openly describe one as your favourite son then your an arsehole", "you are ytah", "YTA-this will likely burn a bridge with the unfavored son.", "YTA", "YTA", "You already know you are an asshole. You know you prefer one over the other, you juat want validation for the reasons. Well, with kids, you don't get validation because they are afrerall your kids, and you are supposed to love them no matter what.
