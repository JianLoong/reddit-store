For one you should tell her that you don't feel comfortable with a 6-year-old on your Nintendo switch. You could have an inappropriate game or they could order stuff by accident. Second if they weren't drinking and needed the six-year-old to be occupied so they can talk or whatever and the kid was already playing it you could have let them play it a little longer. 6-year-olds can throw the biggest fit. But at the same time if I was using somebody's anything for my kid to play with and they asked me to get off of it I would explain to my child that they have to utilize this for a little while so we're going to have to do something else. If my kid whined I would tell them that it is not theirs it was nice of them to let you play it while they weren't on it but you have no right to whine about not playing with something that isn't yours that you didn't buy. Literally I've told my kid this. My kid when she was younger could be a handful too. In all honesty since they are drinking they need to get a babysitter. It's one thing if you are having a glass of wine. No problem. Or even one drink. I know this has nothing to do with who is an a hole or not or anything to do with your actions on this. They should have the kid distracted with this when they're drinking. Many bad things can happen. And Nintendo switch is definitely not a babysitter.
