A glass of wine is one thing. But having \"a few\" drinks usually means at least getting tipsy, and the need to distract the kid tells me there's no one else there. Maybe I'll get downvoted for this, but to me that's seriously fucking irresponsible and I'd be worried about the kid's welfare. Find a babysitter or have someone home that's sober if you're gonna be drinking, JFC.", "Also, any misuse of the terms and conditions by other people on your account can get you banned.  You can lose access to your library.", "I wonder if the neighbor thinks the account belongs to the parent and that's why they asked the OP to jump off so her child could play.", "A 6 year old shouldn't be on any switch but their own anyways. I know switches are marketed as \"family consoles\" but you can get M and T rated games. Since OP is a adult I would assume they're more likely to have GTA V and not sole random baby game", "And if OP\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t allow him to log off his account he has every right to force her out because it\u2019s his account and she is using it by his permission", "I'm suspecting that op's mom used \"get drunk\" as an euphemism to \"do the dance with no pants\" that's why the need the kid to be entertained so hard", "I was waiting to see someone else point that out.", ">Why is nobody talking about how your mom and her friend left a six year old to be babysat by a gaming console while they drank??\n\nExactly, that's the part that jumped out at me.

Up to 350$. Idk about OP but I usually have a solid 25+ dollars in my account + my card auto filled. While I doubt the kid could've really racked up the bill (Nintendo sends you a email with a digital receipt) it would have been annoying to lose a couple bucks", "Depends on the adult tbf. The most adult game I have is Celeste and I'm 26, other than that I play mostly Pokemon and Mario games.", "In this economy that kid should have a job by now and be able to afford their own account.

And you get access to the Gameboy, NES and SNES game libraries they have. Totally worth it.", "We have the expansion pack which is also worth it for the N64, Sega Genesis, Mario Kart tracks, and the Animal Crossing DLC.", "Yeah, I bought the DLC separately for Animal Crossing, so it hasn't been \"worth it\" for me yet to upgrade.
