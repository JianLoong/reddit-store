Then she sent me a text saying that her and her friend are having a few drinks and her friends 6 year old child wanted to play. I said to her that my partner and I have been looking forward to playing with my switch all day so if she could hop off while we were playing. \n\nShe then immediately started an argument, making me feel bad for kicking the kid off of the switch. They wanted to distract him while they had their fun drinking. I explained to my mum that there was plenty of other ways to distract the child like putting on a movie. My partner and I really wanted to play and the child kept kicking us off the switch account. \n\nI then jumped into my account and logged my account off their switch so that I could play my games in peace. Since I logged them out ,there was nothing they could play as to log back into my switch they would have to have my phone for 2 factor identification. \n\nThis started world war 3, with my mums neighbour even getting involved by sending a message asking me to hop off so that her kid could be distracted while they have their fun.
