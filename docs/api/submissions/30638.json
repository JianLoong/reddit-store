If your fianc\u00e9e is not defending you or at least trying to mediate the situation with her mother, it's a red flag for future conflicts. Marriage is a partnership that often requires setting boundaries with family members. If these boundaries can't be established or respected now, it's concerning for your future together.\n\n  \nYour financial arrangement with your fianc\u00e9e seems fair, and you're not obligated to send money to her family, especially if it's not something you've agreed upon together. It's important to have these financial discussions and agreements before entering into marriage.\n\n  \nThe fact that your fianc\u00e9e's mother cursed you out is disrespectful, and your request for an apology is reasonable. It's concerning that your fianc\u00e9e hasn't completely supported you in this.

You offered a solution where your fiance spends her money on her family, and it wasn't good enough for them.\n\nYour future inlaws seem to see you as a big juicy piece of meat they can all chew on.

Like...that's insane. Money is money, what does it matter who sends it?\n\nIt sounds like your fiancee has been talking too much with her mom about your household's finances and I've always felt that's something people shouldn't do. Your household finances, salaries, money surpluses, bonuses, whatever - that's your private info that shouldn't be freely discussed.

That is the only way that I can see that would make this even a little bit acceptable. Otherwise your MIL is nuts and I would run far far away from the family that thinks they \\*deserve\\* to be given money just because. And that fact that your fianc\u00e9e is leaning into this and not telling her mother to kindly go shove it is concerning for your future marriage. You need to talk to her about her mothers behavior and determine where she stands.

LOL", "She\u2019ll never die\nI swear to God, I keep seeing the best kind of people die, but my mother, she\u2019s gonna outlast everyone because she\u2019s the devil \nNTA. \nAlso, I am making the assumption that as your family is in another country that you are an immigrant? \nIt\u2019s incredibly normal to send money home to families in other countries that are disadvantaged I have had many many employees who do the same thing. Is this MIL living under the same circumstances? I mean just because there\u2019s two sets of in-laws doesn\u2019t mean they get the same treatment. I think her entitlement is gross.", "100%", "Fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mother knows that her family isn\u2019t getting any transfers from OP, because her family told her. That\u2019s what she\u2019s pushing for, for OP to take on that responsibility and put his name on it; her daughter sending money (paid for by OP\u2019s income) isn\u2019t enough for her. Fianc\u00e9e still needs to grow a spine, but she isn\u2019t necessarily telling her mother everything. Him sending money to his own family may simply be inferred, since it\u2019s expected culturally.", "Very sus indeed!", "Fiance's lack of push back against her mother makes me think otherwise.", "Great analogy\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Yes. Those are also valid questions.\n\nAlthough it's not like the fact that he sends money to family should be top secret information. She might have just mentioned it.", "It's her mother, not a household pet!", "She asked him to step up and he did. Now she's pissed?! Prenup wouldn't be bad either at this point.", "Came here to say this!", ">There's no way she doesn't regularly do crazy crap.\n\nCould not agree more", "Lololol", "You're not wrong.", "She should probably act like it then.", "I have no idea what that even means."]}
