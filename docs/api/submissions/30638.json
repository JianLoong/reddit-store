If your fianc\u00e9e is not defending you or at least trying to mediate the situation with her mother, it's a red flag for future conflicts. Marriage is a partnership that often requires setting boundaries with family members. If these boundaries can't be established or respected now, it's concerning for your future together.\n\n  \nYour financial arrangement with your fianc\u00e9e seems fair, and you're not obligated to send money to her family, especially if it's not something you've agreed upon together. It's important to have these financial discussions and agreements before entering into marriage.\n\n  \nThe fact that your fianc\u00e9e's mother cursed you out is disrespectful, and your request for an apology is reasonable. It's concerning that your fianc\u00e9e hasn't completely supported you in this.

You offered a solution where your fiance spends her money on her family, and it wasn't good enough for them.\n\nYour future inlaws seem to see you as a big juicy piece of meat they can all chew on.

Like...that's insane. Money is money, what does it matter who sends it?\n\nIt sounds like your fiancee has been talking too much with her mom about your household's finances and I've always felt that's something people shouldn't do. Your household finances, salaries, money surpluses, bonuses, whatever - that's your private info that shouldn't be freely discussed.

That is the only way that I can see that would make this even a little bit acceptable. Otherwise your MIL is nuts and I would run far far away from the family that thinks they \\*deserve\\* to be given money just because. And that fact that your fianc\u00e9e is leaning into this and not telling her mother to kindly go shove it is concerning for your future marriage. You need to talk to her about her mothers behavior and determine where she stands.

That belongs to you, not some old entitled hag.", "How does MIL know that you send money to your family?", "I love this.\n\nThis woman cursed you and insulted you in front of others.. for not giving her family money.  What greed!!\n\nI'm guessing her daughter didn't tell her mom to stop or defend you.\n\nSo you paused the engagement.\n\nThis is amazing. Congrats for standing up for yourself.\n\nNo one here can tell u what to do.  You need to figure out if your girl is worth sticking around.  She will need to prove to you that she will have your back and stand up to her mother... Even cut her own mother off if she has to.\n\nI would have loved to see her and her mother's face when you said the engagement was on hold.  I'm picturing the mother just realized she over extended and should have waited till you were trapped in marriage before demanding money.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is some MIL from hell stuff right here. Maybe you send money to your family because they are... you know. YOUR FAMILY. Calling you out in front of everyone was the beginning of decent and HIGHLY disrespectful.", "Anyone else think this could be from 90 day fianc\u00e9? \n\nAnyways, NTA.

I could maybe see this being a legit argument of MIL or wife\u2019s part after years of marriage, but before the wedding even occurs???\n\nThat\u2019s the whole point of marriage. What makes it more than \u201cjust a piece of paper\u201d. Shared finances. Shared familys. Being Next of Kin and automatic legal heir. \n\nIt\u2019s an important dividing line, and FUTUREMIL through a fit before marriage is just as bad IMHO as you neglecting your wife\u2019s family after marriage. \n\nBut that\u2019s the point.

Boundaries are super important and it seems like you have made a great boundary. The rest of your life will be like this if you marry this women. Sadly she has not broken free of her moms tight grasp and will continue to be swayed by here especially if she dosent see the problem with her mother bullying you. Not a great environment for marriage and or children if you so choose", "Please listen to your Dad or you will be marrying your fiance and her mom.  If she can't set boundaries then this is what your life will be", "Your Dad is right. Your fianc\u00e9 is being bullied by her mother. YOU can\u2019t fix that.

LOL", "Just FYI you do not actually need to be baptized Orthodox for your kid to be baptized Orthodox. Either she didn't know or she was just trying to get you baptized because she thinks you would avoid hell that way. Maybe she asked a priest and he didn't know or thought he could score a BOGO. Regardless, absolutely not necessary.", "Exactly!\n\nThis \"woman\" is really a little girl.\n\nShe's already married to her mommy.", "My MIL lives on the opposite end of the country, I only met her once before the wedding weekend.

MiL passed away about 10 years ago. I think we had a fairly good relationship afterwards. She certainly was less pushy. But I think that might have been transferred to the other son in laws.

MIL will be running that show and ex wife and MIL living off your child support OP.   \n\nMarrying into this family would be the worst mistake imaginable.", "To be honest, DIL may have just innocently answered a question her mom asked. I know it sounds wild, but domineering, codependent or narcissistic mothers are a pretty wild beast. If you\u2019re raised as their daughter, you don\u2019t really have the option of seeing your mom clearly until you\u2019ve moved away- it\u2019s a survival strategy that you learn as a toddler. You\u2019re not allowed to see things clearly- your dad will probably insist on it because he wants her to shut the fuck up on occasion and has learned to tuck his tail between his legs and hide. You will be abused if you push back or try to be a separate person. Then they strategically ratchet up their craziness when they feel you\u2019re pretending to be a real person- they hate that shit. This girl may have never known that her mom thinks that fianc\u00e9es should send money to both families because she likely never thought about it until she felt slighted/ like she lost some battle for supremacy that the daughter didn\u2019t even know could possibly exist. Moms like this either raise clones or sweet, naive daughters who never accept the lessons in bullying from mom, but do learn that they\u2019re not worthy of any trouble- asking mom a question because you genuinely don\u2019t understand creates familial hell. She may have just been talking about what a good guy her boyfriend/ fianc\u00e9 (depending on when she let this detail slip) is and listing some of the things he does that are caring/responsible. I can\u2019t imagine telling my mom that and thinking that she would decide to spin it as a new grift for her family (and that would never happen. My mother would never ask anyone for money- she\u2019s far too proud about things like that, which seems bad in itself, but this chick\u2019s mom is just embarrassing, money-grubbing and grifty).", "This made me laugh out loud."]}
