If you have limited space and the guest bedroom gets turned into a nursery, get rid of the guest bedroom furniture altogether to make room for the baby's crib.\n\nOr invite your mother to stay for a nice long visit when the baby is born.  If your Mom wants to stay for a month to help you transition to motherhood, that's something good for you.  \n\nIf you think money is going Ng to be an issue, look into pre-paying for some necessary expenses.  For instance, can you set aside or pre-pay doctor's bills?  Or go ahead and buy necessary baby items now?  Your husband can't spend money on his mother that is already spent, and he can't complain if it's spent on a legitimate expense.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is not the time to play hostess and acting like she owes the MIL her time and energy after going through the marathon of childbirth is so dismissive.
