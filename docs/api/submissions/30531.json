She can help you like you want, and it would postpone your MIL from visiting.\n\nA woman's mother always comes first before her MIL.\n\nIf it does not work out that way and your MIL comes, be sure to set a return date BEFORE you let her come (and get your husband on board).\n\nNTA.", "NTA-you\u2019re the mother giving birth. You get to decide who and when to have someone around. Your husband responsibility in this is to tell his mother \u201cno\u201d and make sure she understands it. That is his only job at the moment.", "NTA \n\nI don't think she is looking to help, I think she's looking for a couch.", "NTA.  I suspect your fears are spot on. You'll never get rid of her. Tell your husband that if your child told you not to come you'd respect their choice, understand childbirth is a tough time and that bonding with the child is not something to be done with a stranger in the house. And ask him why his mother's feelings are more important than yours?\n\nBTW,  when my SIL had a baby, my mom went to help. Not with the baby, but with the house. She understood the mom didn't need help with the baby, but help with household would be welcome since my brother was working overtime. Since YOUR MIL doesn't see that, it's even more reason for her not to come.", "NTA.\n\nI think the only response to your husband is, \u201cI don\u2019t know, how would you feel if your partner cared more about their estranged mom than the person who spent 9 months growing your baby before dealing with the great pleasures of a ripped, bleeding vagina, leaking breasts, and almost no sleep?\u201d Show him pictures if necessary.", "NTA \n\nShe left her kids and moved to another country and only communicated via facebook. What kinda of mom traits does she think she will pass onto you? What you could suggest is that the first 6 months its a bad idea as you need time to bond with the baby and you wouldn't feel comfortable doing that with a woman your barely know in your house. Then suggest after the 6 months she can come and visit for a week but make sure she has a return flight home.", "NTA.\n\nPut your foot down and let him know that he didnt just carry a baby and then give birth, so he doesnt get the final say on whether or not his mother comes to visit, you do.\n\nwho your husband some birthing and postpartum videos and info.\n\nremind him that your giving birth to a watermelon, and are pushing that baby out of an opening the same size as a ben and jerry ice cream lid.\n\nyou tell your husband that you will not be entertaining her and do not consent to family money being spent on her food and travel. she can either pay for it herself and stay in a hotel or she doesnt come.\n\nyou put your foot down and let him know that if he goes against you,, then mil either needs to stay in a hotel or not come. Other wise you'll stay with family after the baby is born. if you have some close  by.\n\nremind him that your having major surgery, giving birth is hugely important, and that you need to be resting. not taking care of a leeching woman who doesnt care about anyone but what she can benefit from.", "NTA.\n\nSkirt it and say, \"Thanks! Once we are home and settled in a bit, we'll let you know when we're ready for visitors!\"\n\nSet the tone that she has to wait to be invited, and that childcare isn't going to be a need you have of her.", "I am 150% of the opinion that the woman who is about to squeeze a whole human out of her hoohah gets final say on who gets to be around during recovery, NTA.", "NTA\n\nTell your husband he is not a child anymore.  He is a husband and father and needs to protect you, not offer you (and your happiness) up to his mother.  You will not have his mother in your house when you are recovering from a very dramatic medical event, are at your most vulnerable and trying to find your way as a new mother.  \n\nHis mother can wait until she is invited, which will only be when you feel strong and confident, and he is home to do the work of entertaining her.", "NTA:  Accepting a whole person in **your** daily life needs to be discussed and agreed upon.  Considering the impact giving birth to a child has on your physical and mental health, your concerns are primary. I would try to pivot to a MUCH later time for her to visit the baby *after* everything has settled down (6 months to a year).", "NTA - in response to your husband's question about how you would feel, tell him you'd respect the wishes of the person giving birth.", "NTA.  \n\nBUT - don\u2019t tell her not to come, just INFORM her when YOU reply that your husband said she wanted to come and help, and that you could use some help for the week after your mom visits, and of course since you\u2019re living on one pay check during your maternity leave she would have to pay her own ticket\u2026 but you\u2019d be happy to have her for A WEEK, 7 days.  She should backpedal quickly!", "NTA. You\u2019re going to go through a very traumatic (yet beautiful) experience. This is already scary, exciting, painful, yet rewarding. You\u2019re going through A LOT. A while child rearing can be a very rewarding experience, its rewards stem from the difficulty of it all. The LAST thing you need is a dependent adult who brings stress, financial loss, and just a general intrusion on your life. Your husband should be backing you, especially if she basically left and only communicates with him through messenger. She is being selfish and your husband is unsupportive. Maybe have a sit down conversation with him and show him this sub? I hope this works out for you.", "Husband refuses to take any paternity leave, so... who is going to be entertaining his mother?  I mean surely if is offensive to say no, saying yes and then dumping her on someone else is, what?", "Instead of telling her she can\u2019t come just tell her you can\u2019t afford plane tickets for her due to baby expenses and being down to one income.", "NTA- first of all her child is not the one that's going to be in recovery and trying to take care of a newborn for the first time, 2. If you guys are already worried about income why would he even entertain the idea of bring her to YOUR home and having to feed another person let alone probably pay for her trip.", "NTA\n\nA couple of ideas:\n\nStart decorating and setting up your nursery now.  If you have limited space and the guest bedroom gets turned into a nursery, get rid of the guest bedroom furniture altogether to make room for the baby's crib.\n\nOr invite your mother to stay for a nice long visit when the baby is born.  If your Mom wants to stay for a month to help you transition to motherhood, that's something good for you.  \n\nIf you think money is going Ng to be an issue, look into pre-paying for some necessary expenses.  For instance, can you set aside or pre-pay doctor's bills?  Or go ahead and buy necessary baby items now?  Your husband can't spend money on his mother that is already spent, and he can't complain if it's spent on a legitimate expense.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
