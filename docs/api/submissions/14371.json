He as always been a bit more clingy than I am. (I have autism and I really only like being touched when I initiate it) He, on the other hand, always wants to have contact, whether that\u2019s physical, or verbal, or just constantly texting. I\u2019ve tried to limit this and I\u2019ve spoken up about it not being my favorite thing before, he will correct himself in the moment but it will never really lead to long term change. That being said, he really enjoys spending entire days together.\n\nNow on to the story. We get to the coffee shop, get our orders, and find a table. I got some new drink but I can\u2019t really remember the name, all I know is that it was milk based (important to the story). As we continue to chat I noticed that my tummy was feeling a little rumbly. I did not know this at the time, but I had recently developed an intense form of lactose intolerance. \n\nJust as I\u2019m about to get up to run to the bathroom. It happens\u2026 I shit my pants. I sprint to the bathroom like a gazelle fruitlessly running from a cheetah. And oh boy, that was an intense bathroom trip to say the least. \n\nI get cleaned up and luckily didn\u2019t ruin my pants but at this point I\u2019m feeling disgusting, embarrassed, and I just wanted to go home. I tell my boyfriend that I needed to leave, now.  He insisted that I stay and spend time with him and kept asking me what happened. I discretely let him know and he seemed completely unfazed, just asked if I was good now and I said sure but I needed to go. \n\nHere\u2019s where I think I may be the asshole. I told him that he could either come with me and I could drop him off at his dorm or he could find his own way home. He asked me again why I couldn\u2019t just stay and I ended up leaving without saying anything. \n\nInitially, he blew up my phone but now I\u2019ve been on ice for a week. I don\u2019t want to have to break up over this but idk maybe I am the asshole\u2026 let me know.", "created_utc": 1681042691, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ghu42/aita_for_abandoning_my_boyfriend_at_a_coffee_shop/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

F that. The feeling you were having, and he couldn\u2019t understand that even after sharing what had just happened? He\u2019s the AH", "NTA. You made your EXTREMELY REASONABLE needs known, and he neglected them in the name of... a good time? \n\nHis actions were selfish and hurtful, and that's not even getting into how messed up it is that he doesn't care about your general physical boundaries.", "I have no idea where this conflict came from, NTA you were upfront, he seemed okay then all of a sudden flipped. I\u2019d also want to go home if I had an unfortunate accident like you did, even if I was pretty clean by the end I\u2019d still want to go home and have a proper shower. I think any sane person would. You said you could drop him off too which was kind\u2026would he react the same way if you were sick in another way? Like headache or sickness or something? \n\nIm autistic too and I\u2019m very confused by his behaviour.", "Definitely NTA. Anyone (autistic or not) would be mortified by the gastric experience you had. Instead he seems emotionally tone deaf.", "Uhhhhh no NTA I can\u2019t imagine anyone being okay with sitting down to a meal after that, not knowing if it was gastro or what, not knowing if it\u2019s going to happen again, still feeling gross. To attempt insisting on continuing a date at that point is, at best, wildly inconsiderate and rude. It sounds like you had some basic incompatibility anyway, so while it\u2019s gonna feel really crappy\u2026 let the trash take itself out this time.", "Absolutely NTA. You weren\u2019t okay and all he cared about was getting attention. These are some serious red flags.", "NTA, you made your needs clear, and your reasons. It\u2019s very odd that he would want you to be uncomfortable.", "INFO: did he for sure understand that you shit your pants or did he think it was a near miss?", "NTA, who would want to sit in a restaurant out in public after pooping on themselves. That\u2019s just gross!", "NTA but this is definitely breakup-worthy *on your side* because he has shown you how little he cares about you. You deserve better.", "NTA.\n\nIt's outrageous that you have a social emergency and this narcissist is insensitive and demanding instead of understanding.\n\nKnow this: any decent person wouldn't even have had to hear you explain what happened. He would have said, Oh wow, that's too bad. Let's get you home.\n\nI hope the accident with the milk is just the result of a bug rather than the onset of an intolerance. Good luck.", "Nta you have better social skills than him. You politely gave him choices for how to work with your unfortunate situation and he was selfish and had 0 empathy.", "NTA He's young so I'll forgive him for being clingy but sometimes crap happens (not intentional) and you have to end a date early.  He needs to understand and respect your boundaries.\n\nAlso, kudos to you for ordering milk at a coffee shop!", "YTA thy shittage of pants doesn't revoke his rights to a driving.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that he wanted you to continue to hang out in a coffee shop after that\u2026 wow. Most people would want to go home after that. You really had no way to know in the moment if your digestive system would take another turn. You didn\u2019t even know that it was from lactose so for all that was known in the moment you could have been coming down with some illness. He was being incredibly selfish! He played chicken and lost. He expected that if he refused to leave then you\u2019d have to stay. I wouldn\u2019t even feel bad for him not having a ride. That was his choice, and it\u2019s not like he cared that you needed to go home immediately.", "NTA you pooped your pants, that is a good enough reason to leave any place.", "That\u2019s just gross!", "I explicitly explained that I shit my pants.

If I were you I\u2019d take some time to really imagine the rest of your life dealing with kind of behaviour. You can\u2019t change people, so this will be your future with this person. I\u2019m sure they have some really positive traits, but this is a lot to deal with forever.", "NTA in the slightest. Definitely reevaluate the relationship. I\u2019m sorry.", "He left without saying anything after refusing to answer a  good faithed question.", "I'm so sorry but how many times should someone have to explain \"I just shit my pants so I need to go home\" before just... going home? This is not a situation where negotiating to stay is an option lmao", "More than once for maximum understandability.", "Please never go on dates with people. If I'm sick I'm leaving. If you want a ride, you are leaving with me. I'm not going to wait around arguing until I shit my pants again. That is so absurd, I almost don't even know how to respond.
