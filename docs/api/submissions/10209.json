Somehow, I feel as though you\u2019re not telling people what the service animal is because you know that it would be cruel to keep it confined in your room.\n\nYour roommates didn\u2019t sign up to have their allergies triggered and their comfort taken away. You can wait the couple of months to get the ESA until you aren\u2019t actively breaking a lease and compromising your roommates health. \n\nAnd about them taking Benadryl to stop their allergies, it\u2019s wonderful if that works.

Bigger complex tend to be a lot more strict or less lenient. \n\nShowing up with an animal with little to no warning to the roommates/landlord, ESA or not, is a bit rude.

I have allergy medicine I take for when I go out and work but I'd be upset at having to take it everyday because of a lifestyle change I wasn't made aware of. Duct taping the vent is a HUGE safety risk as well. \n\n\nAnd just so you know, a certified letter being 'accepted' or signed does not mean they accept the contents of the letter.

If not, every time you have to use it, you will be encountering them.\n\nThird.  Your landlord.  Even if legally he has to allow it, expect that he will be causing you problems.  For example, charging you pet rent, charging cleaning fees, not responding to service calls promptly--all that kind of stuff.

Sometimes what is allowed legally can still make you an inconsiderate or selfish person. \n\nIt is great that an ESA is working for you. But, you signed up to live in a place with no pets, and it doesn't matter how valid your need is, having a pet does impact that other people who live there (unless it was like a goldfish).\n\nYour roommates do not want to live with a pet and they did the right thing by signing up to live in a place that was pet free. You also signed up to live in a pet free home, now you would like a pet, and so the morally right thing to do would be to find a new accommodation where the people you live with welcome your ESA.\n\nAlso the way you write this post makes you the AH. \n\n1. Your landlord \"accepted\" the letter, but is waiting on their lawyer for advice so what you mean is they literally got and opened the letter, not that they went \"cool, bring in your pet.\"\n2.

You don't say what kind of animal it is, but in the comments say it is a cat and at least one of your roommates is allergic, but of course THEY can just take allergy medicine.

You clearly don't care about the animal if you think it is fine to keep it confined to your room and remove any ventilation. \n5. Your comments demonstrate you are either a troll (I hope) or someone who has very limited interaction with humans.

YTA for that alone. Cats absolutely need space to roam and explore. Keeping a cat inside is fine but it needs space to *be a cat* or it will develop its own health issues. Also, if the litter tray is being kept in your room then your room (and you) will stink. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, YTA for cat cruelty to start\u2026 but then there\u2019s the added issue of you keeping a cat in the house when you have a housemate with allergies. So you have put your health above hers and are demanding she medicates (if medication even works for her). Are you going to pay for this medication you are forcing her to take? You\u2019re being rude and dismissive to her. You could have got a goldfish or a naked mole rat that creates zero dander and needs (almost) zero space.

I am allergic to cats and dogs. I have done allergy panel testing to confirm. I love animals though and like to pet cats, dogs, and other animals weekly by choice. BUT I don't want to live with animals in my house unless I have some control over the whole living situation (like if I owned the house I could take out the carpets and buy air fresheners for every room). The microscopic, uncontrollable dander is in the air, in the carpet, on your clothes, everywhere. If y'all share a vacuum and empty it into the commmunal trash then those dust particles are prob kicked up in the kitchen.\n\nI had a family dog when I was younger and I loved her but she was not supposed to go in my room. I had to take allergy meds daily. I still had bad allergies throughout childhood and after moving home again when there is no dog my allergies have definitely cleared up.", "I don\u2019t view it as any different to renting a non smoking place and then one of the roommates getting a medical marijuana licence and being given the okay from the landlord to smoke it in the house.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the agreement that they all signed for initially.

I said that \"certification\" for ESA's are about as \"official\" as a gold star sticker. Literally anyone can get it for almost any animal.

You can go online to different companies that do ESA letters, and they have their own mental health professionals who will do it. So, they don't \\*actually\\* know anything about you, nor will they be a part of your treatment in the future.

Just because it's fine to take them on a daily basis doesn't make it a good idea, and a lot of people have poor reactions to allergy meds.
