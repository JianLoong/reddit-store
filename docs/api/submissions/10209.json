Somehow, I feel as though you\u2019re not telling people what the service animal is because you know that it would be cruel to keep it confined in your room.\n\nYour roommates didn\u2019t sign up to have their allergies triggered and their comfort taken away. You can wait the couple of months to get the ESA until you aren\u2019t actively breaking a lease and compromising your roommates health. \n\nAnd about them taking Benadryl to stop their allergies, it\u2019s wonderful if that works.

Bigger complex tend to be a lot more strict or less lenient. \n\nShowing up with an animal with little to no warning to the roommates/landlord, ESA or not, is a bit rude.

I have allergy medicine I take for when I go out and work but I'd be upset at having to take it everyday because of a lifestyle change I wasn't made aware of. Duct taping the vent is a HUGE safety risk as well. \n\n\nAnd just so you know, a certified letter being 'accepted' or signed does not mean they accept the contents of the letter.

There is a big difference.", "First, taping the vent is a safety hazard, and if someone in the house does have a cat allergy then this will do very little to help.

Sometimes what is allowed legally can still make you an inconsiderate or selfish person. \n\nIt is great that an ESA is working for you. But, you signed up to live in a place with no pets, and it doesn't matter how valid your need is, having a pet does impact that other people who live there (unless it was like a goldfish).\n\nYour roommates do not want to live with a pet and they did the right thing by signing up to live in a place that was pet free.

So you have put your health above hers and are demanding she medicates (if medication even works for her). Are you going to pay for this medication you are forcing her to take?

I hate that people abused the system so much that ESAs are losing rights like air travel, but I absolutely don't blame airlines for cracking down and ultimately banning them.  \n\n\nI also hate people who think slapping a vest on a pet or getting an ESA letter online means you can take your pet to brunch or the supermarket - ESAs do NOT have the ability to accompany their owner anywhere a pet can't go.", "It\u2019s bizarre that not only do you keep commenting about a subject you clearly don\u2019t understand, but while also being remarkably abrasive.", "Kind of rude of you to say \u201cif you need a service dog, you probably aren\u2019t capable of training them yourself\u201d.

It\u2019s actually REQUIRED that when you get a service dog that you\u2019re apart of the training and it\u2019s in the contract that you sign that you will attend most, if not all training sessions. \n\nAdditionally, they do have handler training programs for people who want to train their own service dogs that are A LOT cheaper for people. You do realize that service dogs can have numerous jobs right? I suggest you research the kinds of jobs service dogs can do. \n\nYour statement was beyond rude and extremely narrow.", "oh no that's so wrong.

It\u2019s far more than just reducing stress and anxiety. My mental health is working against me staying alive daily. Having an animal means that I have to stay alive to take care of that animal. That even if I don\u2019t want to take care of myself, I have a responsibility that keeps me going. You aren\u2019t equipped to decide whether or not there is a legitimate necessity for an ESA and clearly don\u2019t understand the extent of what the certification is for.

ESAs are an accommodation for disability, so if you are not formally diagnosed and labeled disabled - you don't get one.   \n\n\nAlso what do you mean \"force their animal into any situation\"? ESAs don't have public access rights like SDs do - you can't take them anywhere you couldn't take a pet dog.

I have a relative with said issues who is seeking mental healthcare from professionals and her dog is NOT a pet, it's an ESA as its care and well-being affect her own mental health and she has gone through all kinds of health assessments.

The younger is still in training and I've mostly been focused on him helping with my panic attacks and asthma, which he climbs in my arms and screams so that I have his comfort but he also alerts my partner something is wrong. \n\nNeither has ever damaged a house/apartment. And by law in many places if a landlord does an inspection and finds damage from the ESA it can be refused after that. I know California passed that about a year ago and other places were talking about it. I didn't worry because mine have never caused issues. If cats are fixed and have scratching posts and clean litter boxes they are fine 99% of the time so far as damage.", "Potentially. It depends on what services you need performed. Dogs can perform more types of tasks but miniature horses are good for balance and mobility, and tend to live longer than dogs do. So it would depend on what the specifics of your disability is and what you need.", "I don't believe there are any airlines in the US/Canada (where I'm from) that allow ESAs to fly anymore. Too many people abused the system.  Southwest allowed them for a while after most domestic carriers stopped allowing them, but eventually they discontinued it as well.  \n\n\nWhen I had a \"real\" (ie desperately needed for a genuine disability and properly documented by my mental health team) ESA we would see the most horrific pet behaviors from \"ESAs\" at the airport (and even some pets wearing a service dog vest that clearly had zero training). I worked really hard to obedience train my pup to be perfectly behaved on flights, and flight attendants would always compliment us by telling us they didn't even notice there was a dog on the flight. But the airlines made the right call. Now the \"ESA\" websites have started selling SERVICE DOG \"registrations\" (no such thing, there is no required or recognized documentation for service dogs in the US)... which is disgusting, as SDs require EXTENSIVE training, not just a piece of paper you pay for.  \n\n\n(Sorry for the rant, clearly it's something I'm passionate about)", "Adding on to this, service dogs are 20K+ and even then they still require you to be apart of the training. They will not give you the dog without you, as the handler, being present. \n\nI also thought the \u201cyou aren\u2019t capable\u201d comment was beyond rude and really irritated me. It is 100% possible to train your own service dog with the right resources.", "I knew there was some training involved, as, yes, there's no way just to buy one who already knows what you need it to. Yeah, service dogs are expensive as hell lol. I've been looking at one for a while for my son.", "How is saying that, if you need a service dog due to mental or physical disability, then you'll probably find the physically-demanding job of training them extraordinarily difficult rude? Like, what? And being there at the sessions doesn't equal YOU training then. That's you learning how and what they were trained for.", "Actually that is incorrect as having a disability does not make you qualified to train a service dog. In the industry, it is actively discouraged. My daughter has epilepsy due to a cardiac arrest at birth and that makes it impossible for her to train a service dog. I steeped myself in that industry for 18 years and I'm sorry, it is not \"incredibly\" common, rather it is rare as training service dogs takes training on its own and someone with disabilities doing the training is problematic. In addition, The FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT specifically states the dog must perform a services, ie a service dog. You are likely referring (in your other comment) to the CALIFORNIA fair housing act which does include ESA's. Protections for ESA's vary by state but federal only protects service dogs.", "The certificates online are fake, and not legal. Landlords don\u2019t have to accept them.  They do have to accept medical notes from IRL medical teams.", "Correct. \n\nNo requirement for formal training, no recognized criteria to demonstrate that an animal has been (adequately) trained, no official registry, no certification. The only requirement is that they be trained to perform a specific task or service for an individual with a disability. \n\nIt effectively comes down to an owner's word and is difficult to enforce. An owner's inability to maintain control over a dog in public tends to be what prompts most immediate consequences.", "This is correct. There is no (required) certification for service animals. Service animals can only be dogs (or apparently miniature horses but I think that is very unusual). If you say your dog is a service animal and are able/willing to answer these two questions, people are required to just take your word for it.\n\n1. Is the dog a service animal required because of a disability?\n2. What work or task has the dog been trained to  perform?\n\nIt's a system that is absolutely prone to being abused, however (thankfully) in reality abuse seems pretty uncommon.", "I didn't say that going that route was illegitimate? I said the whole ESA thing is a joke. There is no difference between an ESA and a pet. If other people can live places with their non-ESA pets, then why do you thinking you'll have trouble finding housing?

That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not being exploited.", "I\u2019m glad your relative has support. That said, \u201cit\u2019s care and well-being affect her own mental health\u201d seems true of almost everyone.", "Just because some people, like your cousin and OP, have a medically recognized benefit from their animals does not mean that ESAs aren\u2019t largely a scam and a problem for people with service animals and the public who has to deal with untrained animals in public spaces.", "This. Thank you.", "Rant away, I totally get it. I have an ESA dog that\u2019s legit the only reason I\u2019m alive right now. She\u2019s saved me in more ways than one. It drives me nuts how people abuse the title of ESAs and subsequently service dogs for shits and giggles and make it so much harder for people that legit need it. It sucks.", "It\u2019s rude because you\u2019re basically calling people who need these dogs, incapable. You\u2019re putting people with disabilities into some type of narrow box. Sure there are some people who may need some help with training but most people would be totally fine training their own service dogs. \n\nAlso, I never said that just being present means you\u2019re training the dog on ur own. Just stating that it is a requirement and you don\u2019t just get the dog shipped to you all ready to go. \n\nI knew a family who trained a service dog for their nonverbal autistic son. They helped him but for the most part he did a lot of it himself. Even when you\u2019re training a normal puppy on your own, youre going to use trainers and/or online resources but all they\u2019re doing is showing you what to do and how to do it. People with disabilities are more than capable of doing this on their own. \n\nIt\u2019s wrong of you to say that it\u2019s too demanding for someone with a mental or physical disability to be able to train a dog on their own. Additionally, I don\u2019t know many people who can easily shell out 20k+ for a service dog. Sure there\u2019s programs and donations that can help but a lot of people would still have to shell out thousands for the dog. \n\nSomeone with a disability may need a little help with training a dog but not because their disabled. A lot of people need help with training house pets. The issue isn\u2019t that you\u2019re saying people need help with training a dog. The issue is you specifically saying that people with disabilities are incapable of doing so. Very small and narrow minded of you.", "Because it's not true? Service dogs are used for a wide variety of disabilities and many of them do not impact a person's ability to train their own SD. Someone above called out diabetes in particular, which is a great example. And even if it's hard for them or might take a long time, they have the legal right to do so, and for many it's the only option since professional trained SDs are incredibly expense.", "The FHA does, in fact cover ESAs you just need a written recommendation from your licensed healthcare professional. FHA protections are limited to housing and certain forms of transportation.  SERVICE AMIMALS are protected under the ADA and are limited to dogs and miniature ponies who are trained to perform specific tasks, and covers more than housing and transportation.", "Hahaha. That\u2019s hilarious. And ignorant. There are diabetic service dogs and seizure service dogs for people who can live full lives but still need the animal to alert them in medical emergencies.", "In the industry, it is discouraged?  Well, duh, of course trainers of service dogs prefer people pay them lots of money rather than train their own service dog?", "Mm, going to disagree. It really depends on the type of service the dog (or miniature horse) is trained to provide. Many people who use then for panic attacks and such do the training themselves because the cost is so high.", "You are wrong on all fronts. The ADA specifically states that owner training is allowed (see [Q5](https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-faqs/)). Since you apparently worked in SD training, of course you would think that most are professional trained, because that's what you saw every day. I could not find any hard statistics about what percentage of SDs are owner-trained, but I owner-trained my SD and know from interacting in handler spaces that this is common, especially since disabled people often don't have the money to purchase a pre-trained SD. The FHA also specifically does cover [both ESAs and SDs](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/assistance_animals#_What_Is_an). This is why I don't trust the SD industry... So many \"professionals\" out there who don't know the first thing about the laws.\n\nAlso please check your ableist assumptions that people with disabilities cannot train dogs. Maybe your daughter couldn't, but many can. My SD is for PTSD and OCD -- what about that makes it impossible for me to train a dog? Plus I have prior experience training animals.", "Yes. Hence why I said they're a \"scam\"", "For someone with \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d in their username, you seem to care a lot. As an example, I needed a letter to have my cat live at school with me, in a solo room, so no forcing my cat on anyone like you\u2019re saying. We can disagree on the rest.", "Yeah, anyone who actually cares about their pet can claim this, for sure. I'm not knocking the concept of ESAs, I think they can be incredibly helpful, but anyone who has a pet who isn't affected by its care and wellbeing is a questionable pet owner.", "Glad you have your pup. Mine is also the reason I'm still here. I got him after being released from a 2 month inpatient stay and he's one of the best decisions I've ever made for my mental health. I stay because I could never leave him.", "I am so curious what about diabetes make someone unable to train a service dog to detect and alert for low blood sugar. And there are so many more example. So absurdly ableist.", "Thiiiiis. I've seen so many \"reputable\" organizations spread false info like this, or that dogs need to be certified through their program to be legal. Of course they'll tell you that, they make their money off of people's ignorance.", "Oh, I mean ESAs properly prescribed aren\u2019t scams. Just the online.  And, OP is carefully avoiding saying she used the scam sites.  When she finally answered me she said \u201cdiagnosis\u201d and \u201cdoctor\u201d without actually answering the questions.  So, it sure sounds like she did. \n\nI hope her roommates figure this out!", "Whats there to train them in? Cats don't give hugs or hold your hand. Their just there to make you feel better and loved.
