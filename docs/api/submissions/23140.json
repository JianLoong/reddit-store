So maybe he should also be using the hairdryer on his privates.", "Her actions of taking a perfectly normal shower.  \nIf OP's partner can't be pissed to run a blow dryer for a few seconds he can get up earlier and take the first shower.", "Yea but the point is to clean ur mess", "LOL 100%!!!!!", "And her actions fog the mirror.  His act of shaving doesn\u2019t impact the shower. I\u2019m just saying that he is no more obligated to de-fog the mirror than she is. If anything, she is the one who\u2019s more obligated.", "A dude literally got shit on massively for using \u201cfemales\u201d when English wasn\u2019t his primary language because he was \u201cmisogynist\u201d but I bet you\u2019re going to argue your use of \u201cmales\u201d isn\u2019t misandry.", "Could the same be said for men? \n\nShould they be expected to act by the rules you've set because just read this and tell me how it sounds \n\n\"Men should never have to do anything that inconveniences them and certainly not for females. Remember \"if you can't handle him at his worst...\"\"\n\nSounds misogynistic dosnet it So what you have stated is misandristic so it's double standard for you to think she or he should act this way, they are equals and are supposed to help on another not think \"I shouldn't help him because he's a man and I'm a women\" and how would it inconvenience her to blow dry the mirror I'm not saying he couldn't do it either but it's a small ask just saying", "Steam isnt a \"mess\" it evaorates within like 15mins.", "I wouldn't call natural steam a mess. It's not that hard for him to wipe the mirror. If it's that much of an issue he can buy a cheap shaving mirror that has suction cups.", "Neither of them is obligated to defog the mirror, so if he wants a defogged mirror, he'd better get to defogging it.", "I'd disagree. She's actually normal by using the shower. He wants to use the mirror straight after instead of waiting for it to defoe or wiping it.  He needs to use the hair dryer.", "He can also get up before her and do what he wants to do if he\u2019s going to complain and act selfish. It\u2019s a fogged up mirror. It doesn\u2019t take that long to unfog once the door is open. Op, NTA."]}
