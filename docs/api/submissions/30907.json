And even if you have a written surrogacy agreement that\u2019s not legally enforceable in the UK. \n\nYour sisters behavior sounds like it\u2019s escalating. Your husband seems to be supporting your sister more than he does you, his wife. It\u2019s one thing for her to treat you like an incubator, why is your husband going along with it? There are red flags all over the place.\n\nYou\u2019re pregnant and vulnerable and in a very precarious situation. Your sisters behavior is either super manipulative or just plain emotionally unstable, but either way you cannot trust her to have your best interests at heart right now. What happens if you have this baby and either your sister or her ex change their minds about who gets the baby?\n\nDo you trust your husband with your sister? Do you trust your sister around your husband? Do you trust your husband to choose you and your well-being over your sister?", "Was this weird double standards before or after you became her surrogate?", "That might explain her actions then - she has no full ties to the baby because it's also yours like your kids are. So maybe she's viewing your kids as the colloquial \"our\" kids. Personally, I think it's a bad idea to do natural surrogacy for a family member - don't care how much they want a genetic kid, it's still a slippery slope. \n\nTell her her child isn't here yet, and until then, she is NOT to parent YOUR kids. Period.", "I don\u2019t think you understand what\u2019s so gross about age gaps", "Yeah.  When I was nearing 30 I stopped looking at college students like that.  A thirty year old should not be dating teens.", "In the UK surrogacy agreements are not legally binding or legally enforceable. The birth mother (and her spouse if she has one) are automatically legally considered the parent/parents in the UK and the intended parents have to apply to transfer parental rights. There have been cases where people have changed their minds and then the court decides. \n\nThis seems like it\u2019s going to be a mess", "I watch to much lifetime lol", "I dunno about hate, but a ridiculous amount of jealousy, yes.  She sounds super butt hurt, and seemingly trying to form a wedge between OP and her husband with her floppy behavior.  Definitely not to be trusted.", "Like an incubator"]}
