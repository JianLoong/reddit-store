Does she have a partner/coparent for the child you are carrying for her?", "\" won\u2019t speak to me until I apologise.\"\n\nThank God for you.  You get a break from her criticism.  NTA\n\nDon't apologize.  And don't let her overrule you again when you are parenting your kids.  Tell her to keep her opinions to herself.  You are the parent to the 7 and 5, not her.  I'd never argue with my sister about her kids in front of her kids.  That's rude AF.", "NTA at all. This is one of the worst things about being a parent, all of the unsolicited advice. Yeah, people are great at being a perfect parent when they have no freakin' kids.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds like a deeply unpleasant person. Is she always like this? If not, it may very well be what your husband said.\n\n*Could* be fear about her own coming motherhood manifesting as aggressiveness. Or she might just be a kinda narcissistic critic ass. And of course, there are all the hormonal and other changes involved in pregnancy.", "NTA.\n\nYou're doing your sister a favor by acting as a surrogate and she has the gall to tell you how to parent your kids? Sounds to me like she may be a bit too agreeable towards your husband as well. She over-stepped and now she's facing the consequences of her actions.", "NTA\n\nShe is overstepping and sticking her nose in too much. \n\nAlso you are going her an incredible favour. So really she should be being nice as pie to you.", "NTA\nWorst thing when family, or anybody in general, try to micromanage (cause this is micromanaging, not real concern) your parenting style.\nEnjoy your relaxing Xmas with your family. I am sure as soon your sister will have her kid she ll be to busy to micromanage you.", "NTA at all, I would even add that it feels like maybe she\u2019s building resentment toward you because you can carry her child and she can\u2019t? (I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the case, I\u2019m just assuming and could be entirely wrong), but with that resentment she sees you getting to be a mom and also being able to carry her kid while she\u2019s just an onlooker", "\u201cShe started crying and won\u2019t speak to me until I apologize\u201d.  What will she do when the baby arrives?  Did you guys talk through the realities of surrogacy?  I hope you all get some counseling.", "Husband can apologize - she only listens to him anyway /s\n\nI would send this link so she can see the pattern of her ongoing behavior.

And when your husband says it's on you, remind him that it's not your behaviour that's creating the problem.", "NTA, she is being obnoxious. Bet it has more to do with the older sister dynamic than what your husband thinks it is.", "NTA. You are facing unfair and contradictory criticism, and you drew some boundaries.

It's troubling that your husband doesn't have your back here, too.", "So let me get this straight, she abusing your parenting, WHILE YOURE PREGNANT WITH HER CHILD??? THE PREGNANT WOMAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE GIVEN LENIENCY not the donor. What is wrong with your husband? Why are you being a pushover for her? Why did you become her surrogate?

Does she have a husband in the picture?   Be more assertive.  Next time something happens, just say, Sis, I am perfectly capable of taking care of my children.  Sis, I said no.

I think your husband is right that she's just freaking out a little, especially if this is new behavior for her, but he's wrong that you need to apologize.

You sure nothing is going on between them? NTA", "I had the same thoughts, that maybe your sister and husband aren't being honest about something.

The hell with her.", "Oh shit, this is a really good point.", "Not only that, but I'm starting to wonder why op's husband seems to be perfect in sisters eyes.. it's kinda worrisome. Like she basically wants to kick op out and play happy families with her family. All the negative comments about op like she can do it better. If it wasn't for the fact that op is already pregnant I'd tell her to reconsider it. And distance herself from her sister. To me personally... It's like she's just trying to take over ops family. She wants to be the mommy.
