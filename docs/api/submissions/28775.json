Yes, you technically own it, but at what cost are you willing to keep it just because you like it and the possibility that she will sell it? What if she is telling the truth?\n\n**Scenario #1:**\n\nYou keep the ring. Aunt holds a potentially lifelong grudge against you, family remains divided, and you retain the possession of a ring you like that belonged to your grandmother. You didn't say you're keeping it because it meant a lot to your Grandmother, you said, \"frankly, I like it.\"\n\n\n**Scenario #2:**\n\nYou give up the ring that is rightfully yours. Your aunt is content and family united. You lose out on a ring you like. Worst case your Aunt sells it, in which case you will be proven right. It'd not be impossible to recover. You could even say, \"hey look I'm trusting you not to sell this, but if you ever do let me know first.\"\n\nI know what I would do, but to each their own.", "NTA.  The gran made the decision  when she was alive. Tell her no.", "Your grandmother gave you that ring. Don't let anyone have it.", "Keep the ring! NTA", "NTA. It was gifted to you before she passed. There\u2019s not basis for aunt to claim it. And why should her desire to have it trump yours or your mom\u2019s?", "Bingo.", "Also, OP should get a safety box at a bank to keep it safe and get it appraised and insured to make sure ownership stays with OP so if it does go missing police can be involved. \n\nNTA", "In fairness, I would feel like I have a stronger claim on anything sentimental to me of my mother's possessions than my nieces or nephews even if it was in their possession. I wouldn't demand it or anything.\n\nWhen my grandmother passed there was a specific set of figurines that I really wanted to keep. I expressed to several family members of it. I found out that my uncle kept them first chance he got, and I never made a fuss about it because it was *his* mom.\n\nI'm not saying what OP's aunt is doing is right, but I certainly would understand. OP's aunt is saying it has strong sentimental value. OP is saying she just likes it, and that she doesn't believe aunt. I don't feel like liking something is enough for me to keep it from my aunt even if it technically belongs to me.", "This right here. If grandma wanted your aunt to have it she would have given it to her. She didn't she gave it to you. Don't be bullied into giving it up. NTA", "I'm almost certain they were meant as a gift. She intended to split her personal jewellery evenly between everyone but that went out the window when she decided that one of my cousins was stealing from her. When she gave the boxes and the ring to me she said that, when she died, it would be unfair for my mother and I to end up with only about a third of her total jewellery: one third being my aunt's 'half' and the other third being what my cousin stole.", "The ring isn't mentioned in the will. Everything in it is generalised (e.g 'My personal effects') aside from some specific sentimental items that everyone agreed ahead of time would go to my uncle.", "NTA but put the ring in a safe place before it \"goes missing\" just like the items your cousin stole."]}
