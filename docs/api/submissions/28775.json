My grandmother believed one of my cousins was stealing jewellery from her (this was an ongoing saga, I think she was right but my parents and my uncle aren't very bothered now that she's dead). In light of this, she was worried about too much of her jewellery going to my aunt/cousins or being sold so gave me two boxes including the ring and made me promise not to tell anyone because she knew exactly what would happen.\n\nMy mother told my aunt that I have the ring and I\u2019m sure you can imagine how my aunt reacted. She says she wants it because it\u2019s something very heavily associated with her mother and if it were any other piece I\u2019d probably let her have it, but frankly I like it and I don\u2019t really believe her anyway. I know it makes me sound like a real snob but my aunt married very badly and refused to work, so her family relied heavily on my grandparents for money. The ring is worth about five figures and I know my aunt; I 100% believe she could and would sell it if she got it.\n\nThe family\u2019s now split on what I should do.

Your grandmother specifically gave you the ring---not your aunt. If the ring is all that valuable to her then she should offer to compensate you for letting her have it.

I'm not discussing it further, feel free to take it up with a dead woman.", "NTA, your grandmother gave YOU the ring over a year ago. Your aunt has no rights to the ring your gran gave you over a year just cause she wants it.
