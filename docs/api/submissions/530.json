It\u2019s nothing glamorous or super high paying but it\u2019s a step in that direction. Salary wise I make what both my parents make combined annually. And part of my benefits package is a company paid life insurance policy that pays out a years salary to my beneficiary of my choosing.\n\nI\u2019m single with no kids and I live with my parents. I have an older brother who is a mess and a nephew from said brother who is 8.\n\nMy brother is horrible with money, can\u2019t keep a job to save his life and is behind on child support payments. He also doesn\u2019t have primary custody of my nephew.\n\nMy nephews mom has three other kids with all different dads, lives off welfare and multiple child support payments.\n\nBecause of this putting my nephew down as a beneficiary doesn\u2019t seem like a good option until he\u2019s at least 18.\n\nIn my moms eyes my brother can do no wrong. She will bend over backwards to give him money if he needs it. He didn\u2019t have the same opportunities to go to college as me so it\u2019s not fair to expect so much of him. We were raised by the same parents in the same house with the same budget he just chose to drop out of community college to get married at 20. On top of this my mom had a lot of family in Mexico and she sends more than half of her paycheck to keep all of her siblings and nephews over there housed, fed\u2026 etc. when they are all older, have their own homes and kids that help them out as well. She\u2019s just bad with money and never even checks her bank account as long as the card gets approved it\u2019s all good in her eyes. It\u2019s for this reason that my mom and dad separated their finances.\n\nMy dad is the one that pays the bills, keeps everyone on track. He is strict and tough but he will never leave my brother or nephew on the streets. We have the same priorities as in keeping our household afloat and only helping others when it\u2019s okay and they absolutely need it.\n\nSo yesterday I asked my dad for his info to put him down as my sole beneficiary. I explained to him why I was doing this and what I would like him to do with the cash should anything happen to me. It\u2019ll be a safety net for the family. Not to be used to pay child support or any divorces or custody battles my brother may have in the future that\u2019s his responsibility. No sending money to relatives in other countries. I\u2019ve only met them once in my whole life and they can take care of themselves. And if there is enough down the line, to help pay for my nephews college if he chooses to go when the time comes.\n\nMy dad agreed. My mom on the other hand did not. She overheard the whole thing and is now mad I wouldn\u2019t put her down as a beneficiary. Like passive aggressively.\n\nSo Reddit am I the asshole for not putting my mom down as a life insurance beneficiary?", "created_utc": 1667067799, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygqvu3/aita_for_not_putting_my_mom_down_as_a_beneficiary/", "score": 930, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a taxable benefit, I get to see on my paystub that the cost of that benefit is about 87 cents per pay period. Over my 24 pay periods a year that's a tad more than $20/year.\n\nI don't say this to lessen the value of what you do, or how much this kind of payout might mean to someone, but rather to compare that to the cost of what you are suggesting. As an attorney you surely understand how quickly billable hours can add up. [This source](https://www.lsslawyers.com/articles/the-power-of-the-irrevocable-life-insurance-trust/) puts the cost of establishing an ILIT at $1,750 and $300 per year to maintain it. Other sources online give similar figures. When it comes to your clients, is this really what you're trying to sell them on to manage a 1x salary life insurance policy? Do you consider that a responsible use of their money?", "An ILIT, if it has no income, does not file returns and costs essentially $0 during the grantor\u2019s life. $1750 is high for a basic trust; almost double what I charge. But specific to your question, yes - if the benefit is $30,000+, it is absolutely worth structuring properly. \n\nFYI: as a professional, I do not \u201csell\u201d ANYTHING to my clients. I provide the work and advice that they need, which often includes telling them they do not need a lot of things they come in thinking are necessary. A good lawyer does what is best for his clients, not his wallet.", "A $800 charge for a life insurance structuring which will almost certainly never be paid is not in the best interest of OP.", "I charge way more than that for ILITs, but I fail to see the utility vs. a will with a testamentary trust here. Perhaps your jurisdiction has some quirks the ones I'm licensed in don't. Dunno. Either way I 100% agree with talking to a lawyer, a trust of some sort works way better here.", "You are absolutely correct.  A test trust would work great and is normally what I would do, although I\u2019ve had some issues lately where the ins company does not want to accept a beneficiary that does not exist yet (at least in my state, a test trust does not exist until the will takes effect at death). I just threw out the ILIT here because I did not want to get into wills with the Google scholars - just trying to give a little helpful guidance to OP \ud83d\ude1c", "Internet \"lawyers\" are fun. ;)"]}
