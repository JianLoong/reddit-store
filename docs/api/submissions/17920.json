Early on during our dating period, she made it clear that her daughter has a father and she\u2019s not looking for another father for her. The ground rules were set by her which and that I will be an adult figure but not a parental one. I will have no say in how she is to be brought up and I can\u2019t punish her in anyway.

The girl constantly gets into trouble and has been kicked out of several schools (she lived with her father at the time). She had to move in with us so she could attend a new high school in order to graduate. She\u2019s been suspended several times at this HS but it looks like she\u2019ll graduate on time. While living with us, she\u2019s gotten into 2 car accidents (once when she was drunk) and we had to remortgaged our house to pay her attorney fees and legal bills. The judge dressed us down in court for not being better parents. I\u2019m not a legal expert at all but from movies and shows, I know that judges can jail you for arguing so I bit my tongue and took it. It was humiliating.\n\nThe girl is a couple of months away from being an adult and this weekend, I was out with the guys and she came up in conversation. I complained about how much money I\u2019ve spent bailing her out of trouble and that I can\u2019t wait until she turns 18 so she can face her own consequences.

I still don\u2019t think I said anything wrong but I\u2019m staying at a motel tonight.\n\nI want to be clear we\u2019re not kicking her out and considering she doesn\u2019t work, she\u2019ll be living with us for awhile.

No one is forcing anything on you.  You married the mom. You took custody of that kid.  Get couples therapy and think about how you and your wife can be a team, and not roommates with her daughter.", "Overall I say NTA, but it\u2019s hard to make a real judgement because there could obviously be a lot more to this story. From what you\u2019ve described though, it sounds like you\u2019ve been a saint and given a lot more than you were obligated to. Your wife is the real AH here. She says on the one hand you aren\u2019t allowed any input parenting her daughter, yet you should still be forced to swoop in and fix/pay for all these problems? Your \u201cfriends\u201d are also AH for tattling on you like that. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for feeling the way you do, however I don\u2019t see how her turning 18 will magically change things. Yes, your wife and you won\u2019t be liable for her legally, but I find it doubtful your wife will accept just letting her rot in jail if she messes up again. You\u2019ll still end up being roped in to help pick up the pieces unless you want to destroy your marriage. I guess you need to decide if you\u2019re ok living like that indefinitely until the girl gets her shit together. I think your wife also needs to decide if she\u2019s willing to keep on enabling her at the expense of your marriage.

You had a conversation we shared your honest opinion with an appropriate audience (friends), and that information was shared inappropriately. I strongly believe that the victim of gossip is not the AH.\n\nAnother note: is your name on the title of the house, or the lease?

Your wife, on the other hand...", "NTA - it is hardly surprising that you feel this way and given that your wife made it clear you were not in anyway in control of this situation because you have no say over her daughter you must feel pretty trapped. If your wife is ticked off at you for admitting how you felt maybe she ought to consider her role in backing you into this corner where you are admonished by judges for a \"child\" you have had no part in raising. In my view you didn't HAVE to even BE in court that day, she is her mother and father's responsibility, not yours at their say so, but presumably you went along as moral support anyway and were humiliated for it.", "I had a boyfriend who told me that my adult children couldn\u2019t live with us.

Is it?", "NTA but you might want to reconsider your marriage. This isn\u2019t even regarding how good a relationship you have with your wife. Kids don\u2019t stop once they hit 18.

What happens when she can\u2019t get her life together because (as it sounds based on her mother and father) she didn\u2019t develop a sound foundation to build a life as an adult? Your wife is going to turn to you everytime.", "NTA You have had no say in how she is/ was raised but when she got in trouble YOU had to refinance your house to help her? Your wife and her ex are the assholes and I feel bad that you\u2019ve dealt with it for so long but if you think she\u2019ll stop being your responsibility after she turns 18, you are mistaken unless you leave your wife.", "NTA. If you were explicitly told you are not a parent, why are you paying to bail her out. Time to cut her and her mom loose.", "Are you responsible for her or not? Because you say that you're not allowed any say in how she's raised, but that you're financially responsible for her mistakes. You're either her guardian or not.\n\nYou're an asshole, but only to yourself. Your wife and her daughter are leeching from you. \n\nYou're NTA.", "I\u2019d kick her and the mom out.", "Your first mistake was muff-diving right into that undermining, emasculating red flag of an agreement, but NTA. That, and the way your wife reacted to finding out tells me the apple doesn't fall far from the snake. Thought crime is a sign that you're living in a dystopia.\n\nYou wouldn't even be it if you bought her a birthday cake with all the NTA replies from this post.", "Why the hell are YOUR finances being affected (mortgage etc..) for a kid you aren\u2019t allowed to parent? As mom says, the kid has two parents, so their savings should be tapped into to pay for her legal fees. NTA but you\u2019re being a doormat.", "Why the heck did you marry after one year?", "If the decision for you to have no parental input was made early on in the relationship then why are you expected to bail her out? You should have left mom and dad to figure it out, financially or otherwise. \n\nNTA- her behavioral problems are for her parents to deal with. I would just stay out of it and give my opinion only when asked. Have that conversation and set those boundaries with your wife.", "Why are you bailing her out? If you're not a parental figure you shouldn't take on parental responsibilities. NTA but also you should stand your ground and stop helping", "NTA. Your wife has failed her kid and so has the kid's dad.\nWhy should you be at a hotel when you have followed your wife's rules about the kid. I never would have stood up in court as a parent to the kid let alone take on financial responsibility to get her our of trouble. You followed your wife's rules and now she is pissed at you? No way would I let her get by with her bs. Good luck with both of them cause you will need it.", "The truth is that you weren\u2019t legally liable for her\u2026unless she was driving a car in your name. You need to hold your wife to the previous agreement  NOW, not when her daughter turns 18.  \n\nNTA", "YTA and her \u201cmom\u201d is an even bigger one. No wonder this poor girl is acting out, she\u2019s had to deal with adult children her whole life. How can you expect her to respect you when you\u2019ve had no consideration for her. Ignorant to marry someone with kids expecting zero responsibility", "NTA. Honestly, kicking her out may be the best thing for her. She\u2019ll be forced to face the consequences of her actions.\n\nAlso, why did you have to remortgage to pay her bills? If you can\u2019t have a say in how she\u2019s raised you shouldn\u2019t have to financially support her.", "Nta\n\nLol idk if this is harsh. But I would have divorced the mother first time I was expected to pay for HER daughter\u2019s court bills after being told I wasn\u2019t to be a parental figure.\n\nBut, kids are a deal breaker for me period. Never would have even got past the first date if I found out she had a kid.", "Why are you even doing all of this? Just get a divorce. Do you really think your wife is going to be okay with not bailing her out the minute she turns 18? You already said there's no plans for her to work, so who's going to be paying for her? You need to take a more active role in your own life and stop just letting all of this happened to you.", "This! If you aren\u2019t anything to her, then you shouldn\u2019t be putting any money toward her at all. \n\nNTA.", "Yep, she'll be a full blown addict raging through their home anytime she needs money or someone to blame.", "Yeah but at 18 she's a legal adult and he can wash his hands of her. His 'daughter' will have to clean up her own messes. He's not legally bound to pay for anything related to the law or damages she may do.", ">If you're not a parental figure why are you paying for these things at all? You're a saint for putting up with this.  \n>  \n>Nta. Mom wants to have her cake and eat it too.\n\nThis.  NTA, man.", "Actually, mom wants to be a terrible mother and wanted to ruin any possible relationship her daughter and her husband could have had. She is the problem, not the daughter.", "This was literally my first thought as well. I would be hella wary of dating or marrying someone with a kid who said that I would \"just be an adult figure,\" in the kids life if marriage was on the table. This woman sounds like she has no fckng clue what she is doing while also being a control freak and not respecting your contribution in the slightest.\n\nHopefully things improve once the daughter is out of the house. Honestly, I would probably file for divorce.", "Did you mean that she wants to have her cake, but then eat it too?", "Exactly! You can\u2019t parent her at all but still have to foot the bill and bail her out? NTA! Your wife and her ex created your monster step daughter and you should not have to deal with the consequences when you are in no way allowed to prevent the problems from happening. Your wife has no right to be mad when she made the rules.", "The important part is being linked to the legal fees involved... they already refinanced the house,  which means even if they get divorced the equity is probably fucked. What's op going to have to sell next time she does something terrible?", "I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s fair. Unless there were a ton of warning signs that he\u2019s not mentioning, how was he supposed to know when the girl was 14 that she would end up being so terribly behaved?", "Good point!", "This. \n\nIt sounds like there is more than one person in your life you can\u2019t trust at this point. You are running the risk of falling even deeper down this rabbit hole, and if you don\u2019t know who is really on your side if things go south\u2026 man. I feel for you. Try to figure out who betrayed your trust when you were venting, because that person needs to *go*.\n\nNTA", "Yeah, it sounds like the mom is enabling the daughter.", "Obviously, he made it clear that she won\u2019t listen !", "I wouldn't wait till 18", "I highly disagree. People are allowed to vent to their friends. This is a situation worth venting about. I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth seeking therapy over because it\u2019s a complete shit show. I don\u2019t see how anyone could cope with this living arrangement without blowing off some steam.", "Why , why do think OP should not share his stress and frustration with his friends ?", "What? He doesn't have custody and the mom told him he's not a parent.", ">You are thinking like a child. \n\nAnd you read like one. How did you shit out this comment while ignoring all the relevant context?", "Well, I don\u2019t think he has custody over her at all. I also don\u2019t think he needs to \u201ctake responsibility\u201c because it sounds like he\u2019s been doing that the whole time. I mean, he\u2019s talking about having to remortgage the house to pay for her legal fees- he didn\u2019t HAVE to do that. Neither did mom, honestly. He seems pretty damn generous in this case, actually. The daughter is the one who needs to learn some responsibility. He literally IS an innocent pawn- her married his wife with the expectation SHE GAVE to him that he wouldn\u2019t have to do dad stuff, but here he is doing dad stuff!", "Yeah you\u2019re right, sounds like the daughter will be on a real path to success \ud83d\ude06", "Yeah I'm sure they would be better off with those legal fees OP paid for lol", "No but his wife is still there and clearly doesn\u2019t like that stance.  It\u2019s not going to be as clear cut as \u201c18 and cutting the cord\u201d", "He wasn\u2019t legally bound to pay for any of it to begin with. It\u2019s not his kid. His wife conned him into being a piggy bank for her shitty kid. That isn\u2019t gonna stop any time soo.", "For sure", "Sounds like they are both a problem. The mom is just the root of the problem while the daughter is a symptom.", "What was the point of this comment", "Because you should date someone for more than a year before getting married. Especially when a kid is involved.", "Getting into the relationship, you are spot on about that but the fact (1) he feels incapable of leaving and (2) is resigned to submitting to the will of others, works pretty well for a definition of prison.", "I'm putting money on either mommy's girl can do no wrong, or she was hiding her daughters behavior problems until he was in too deep.", "Is \"Marry me and pay for this gremlin's rearing and legal fees while holding zero authority\" not enough for ya?", "He made absolutely nothing clear.", "And before a kid gets to that point, there are signs, there are smaller things, and there is a reason. Most of the time that reason is the parents. Her family exploits when she is in one of the tuffest periods of our life. Her whole world is turned upside down. She probably had to put up with hours of fighting prior to separation. Then mum meets a guy, and in one year marries him. Of course when the relationship started the mum didn't want him to try and replace her father. That is good but he is still a male adult figure and still has responsibilities in teaching her and caring for her. Then time goes on, situation changes, trying yo say but years ago you said.. is a cop out because you've been a shitty role model. \n\nI love all the comments that don't once ask why she is acting out.", "He\u2019s not taking responsibility for her - he\u2019s just throwing money at the problem. If he were really taking responsibility he\u2019d have a part in raising her and creating consequences.", "His wife is gonna keep supporting the daughter using OP's money until OP is willing to bail.  NTA but I seriously doubt this is gonna improve at all when she turns 18, or at all anytime soon.  You should be protecting yourself OP - if mom is going to get daughter drive your cars, etc., she could bankrupt you and ruin your life.  Look at this motel stay as an opportunity to reevaluate your situation and find a new place where daughter won't be and won't be welcome.", "I was really baked :. not a good one", "It sounds like she lived with dad for at least a while before moving in with Op and mom? \n\nIt\u2019s possible she chose dad because he was the more lax parent and dad screwed her up and mom is just dealing with the consequences?\n\nHeck, it\u2019s sounds like dad just said \u201cf it, I\u2019m done\u201d and left mom to deal with it.\n\nMom isn\u2019t great, but dad had the majority custody-or the kid at least loved with dad. Dad probably bears the most responsibility for all of this. \n\nIt suck for OP though bI wouldn\u2019t have remortgaged my house for someone\u2019s DUI attorney.", "He\u2019s not \u201cthrowing money at the problem\u201d- legal fees need to get paid lol. He\u2019s not trying to solve the problem by paying for lawyers either. Regardless, her mother specifically said she didn\u2019t want him to help with raising her. She\u2019s not his job, not his child, not his responsibility. What he\u2019s doing is more than what he should be.", "Bro said \"wait...there's cake?\"", "I wouldn\u2019t pay legal fees for a stepchild I wasn\u2019t even allowed to parent. Seems like a fair trade - OP mortgages the house to get the kid out of trouble but in return both the daughter and her mom need to suffer some consequences. Perhaps if someone had stepped up along the line these problems wouldn\u2019t continue to occur.", "I do agree he\u2019s doing more then he should."]}
