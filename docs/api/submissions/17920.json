{"id": 17920, "submission_id": "13owmgj", "title": "AITA for counting down the days until my \u201cdaughter\u201dturns 18 so I can stop being legally responsible for her?", "selftext": "I married my wife about 2 years ago and she has a daughter from a previous relationship. Early on during our dating period, she made it clear that her daughter has a father and she\u2019s not looking for another father for her. The ground rules were set by her which and that I will be an adult figure but not a parental one. I will have no say in how she is to be brought up and I can\u2019t punish her in anyway. Considering she was 14 when her mom and I met and 15 when we married, I agreed to her rules. My thinking is that she\u2019s already too old for me to make any difference in her life so why make it an issue.\n\nFast forward a couple of years and my life has been a nightmare. The girl constantly gets into trouble and has been kicked out of several schools (she lived with her father at the time). She had to move in with us so she could attend a new high school in order to graduate. She\u2019s been suspended several times at this HS but it looks like she\u2019ll graduate on time. While living with us, she\u2019s gotten into 2 car accidents (once when she was drunk) and we had to remortgaged our house to pay her attorney fees and legal bills. The judge dressed us down in court for not being better parents. I\u2019m not a legal expert at all but from movies and shows, I know that judges can jail you for arguing so I bit my tongue and took it. It was humiliating.\n\nThe girl is a couple of months away from being an adult and this weekend, I was out with the guys and she came up in conversation. I complained about how much money I\u2019ve spent bailing her out of trouble and that I can\u2019t wait until she turns 18 so she can face her own consequences. Word got back to my wife and she blew her top. I still don\u2019t think I said anything wrong but I\u2019m staying at a motel tonight.\n\nI want to be clear we\u2019re not kicking her out and considering she doesn\u2019t work, she\u2019ll be living with us for awhile. I\u2019m just waiting for the day she\u2019s an adult so I won\u2019t be yelled at by anymore judges.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post. I wrote it while I was very angry so I left out some details. I read through all of the responses and will answer some common questions.\n\n1. I built the house myself before I met my wife so it\u2019s solely mine. I call it \u201cours\u201d not because she\u2019s on the papers but because she\u2019s been living here and we\u2019re married. My wife doesn\u2019t really ask me to help out but I make more than her and her ex combined. She struggles to pay for her daughter and could never afford an attorney. I know my wife would be heart broken if her only child was jailed so I decided to pay for the attorney to keep my wife sane.\n\n2. The bio dad lives several states away and have gone low contact with his daughter. I\u2019m not exactly sure why because I was never told the reason. I didn\u2019t have to go to court but my wife had to go so I took the day off to go and support her. When the judge ordered the parents to come to stand before him, my wife could barely walk so I held her arm and helped her to the bench which was why I was standing there. I\u2019ve never been had any dealings with the court outside of speeding tickets and I took care of those with the clerks. Standing in front of a judge who can jail me made me terrified and having him yelled at me was the most humiliating thing I\u2019ve even gone through which is the main reason why I\u2019m so excited for the girl to turn 18 so I will no longer be called in front of a judge.\n\n3. The 1st car she wrecked was her mother\u2019s old car that was gifted to her when I bought my wife a new car. The 2nd car she wrecked was my old car I gave to her when I bought myself a new car. There\u2019s been no talks of getting her another car because her license has been suspended.", "created_utc": 1684775086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13owmgj/aita_for_counting_down_the_days_until_my/", "score": 6142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, your wife and you won\u2019t be liable for her legally, but I find it doubtful your wife will accept just letting her rot in jail if she messes up again. You\u2019ll still end up being roped in to help pick up the pieces unless you want to destroy your marriage.

Made for a fun house!", "NTA - but speaking as a 16 year old girl when my mom remarried, I may have hated him then - but he taught me so much in those two years and I consider him my dad. I don\u2019t think it was even close to heading down this girls\u2019 path, but I was still a jerk and I know I changed a lot because of him. I\u2019m sad on her behalf that you were excluded from that aspect of her life. You might have made a good deal of difference like mine did for me- 19 years later I love my Dad.", "You really think you\u2019re off the hook at 18??? You were never really on the hook since you aren\u2019t her legal guardian. You choose to be on that hook to help your wife. It was never your responsibility to bail her out or help her financially. And you really think your wife will stop supporting and enabling her daughter when she turn 18? Your wife will never stop, and she will expect you to help her as well. NTA for saying it.", "NTA- at least you tried, it's the parents of delinquent kids that aren't trying that deserve that kind of treatment.", "NTA, but how are you going to feel about your money being used to help someone who will likey kill or gravely injured someone in the future?\n\n From what it sounds like, she has been very lucky, many people could be dead by now, and she could be in jail without a chance easily already with slightly worse luck.", "Nta", "youve been so patient with her when it isnt even your responsibility as your wife made it clear you werent the father figure. Your daughter needs to be disciplined however even though you are in the right it might be best for her mum to speak to her rather than you. Bless you for putting up with it tho hope it gets easier", "Actually you kind of are. Have you paid any attention to how she\u2019s treated by her father or mother? She\u2019s acting out for attention I\u2019ve been in that position. Not as a parental figure but as a decent human being. She probably wants respect. Try sitting down and talking to her about why she\u2019s doing these things and if there\u2019s something you can do to try to help improve her attitude. If she shuts down and refuses from there then yes that\u2019s on her for saying no to help. But the least you can do as her legal step father is try to see things from her point of view. Split households are filled with stress and anxiety for the children involved even when it seems like there shouldn\u2019t be. There\u2019s always more to the picture. How are you going to feel if all she needed was actual support and respect and you could have given that to her and built your own relationship with her? I just think you need to sit down like an adult and have a conversation with her one on one and see if she\u2019s in genuine need of mental support and stability. Financial support doesn\u2019t mean shit. And btw. If your wife truly loves her daughter you\u2019ll lose your wife if you try to outright kick out her daughter.", "They have been married for just 2 years. I have a feeling that house is his. Because what kind of equity would you build in 2 years with how real estate is right now. I am really curious to know if he owned the house before marriage.", "Real life gets messy. The girl\u2019s parents divorced when she was 14, and based on how uninvolved the real dad sounds, I bet life wasn\u2019t roses for her before that. Then her mom meets and marries a new guy a year later, while the daughter is off living with the dad. \n\nThis whole situation is layers of messed up, everyone here needs counseling.", "You're a single mom aren't you?

This isn't the only reason, but being expected to be a 'nacho' parent is just one reason I don't bother trying to integrate into an existing family unit.", "Talking to her and treating her with respect isn\u2019t acting like a parent it\u2019s acting like a concerned human being. It\u2019s treating her like a human being instead of something that can be thrown out.", "Ez karma. Literally it", "This is what came to my mind also. I wonder if the mom love bombed OP and got him to marry her fast. It does feel like a very fast marriage. But I can\u2019t imagine OPs wife being that great of a person if her daughter is like this and she also put OP in such a terrible predicament also while saying he has no rights to discipline her. I think the daughter is deeply damaged by both her bio parents and even after she turns 18 OP is going to be expected to pay for the problems. I don\u2019t think OP should stay in this kind of a situation, and hope he gets out. But that\u2019s of course OPs decision. NTA", "Because her acting out isn't the question we are judging.\n\nAnd the reason is irrelevant. The question is about when OP said.", "Suckahhhh. Poor OP. He shoulda bailed much sooner. \n\nAnd no one shoulda given the girl a second car to wreck!", "u/scareddepartment289 is a bot", "OP seems to be parenting both his wife and stepdaughter, neither in healthy ways", "Yes but the reason she is acting out could change how he replied. If his attitude and actions had something to do with why she is acting out, then he is an AH for saying what he said and an AH for his actions. If he has always done his best and been a good role model and is just an innocent victim (I doubt it) then he is NTA. People just jump to conclusions without having all the relevant information. For all we know, OP ignored her, didn't listen to her, was verbally abusive towards her. We don't know and won't because no way he would ever tell us. He will always say he is just an innocent victim, it doesn't mean it is true. \n\nBasically kids acting out so much is down to the kid not feeling happy. Most of the time, if it's not tgat they live in a really rough neighbourhood and she has gangs influencing her (I really do not think do), then parenting, or tge adults in her life are to blame. There are 3 adults here. Dad, mum and OP. To think OP is just an innocent victim is na\u00efve. They all will have played a role.", "This always confuses me, and I guess I'm out of the loop. What's the purpose of these bots?", "Not just that, but healthy minded and relatively contented teens don't do this stuff, shes obviouslygoing tf through it mentally. Why's she acting this way? Her mom needs to actually parent her and take care of her. Not OP.", "No projection here.", "I get triggered when people say stupid things and judge people they know nothing about. There is litterally no information to suggest at any point the mother is the issue. People just demonising her is ludicrous. Seriously what in this post says the mother is a fault?", "As a parent it makes me laugh a bit when ppl write on Reddit \u201cyeah when the kid is 18 you can wash you hands off\u201d. Yes maybe he can, the mother won\u2019t. If he wants to get rid of the step daughter he needs to divorce the wife, that\u2019s the only way", "NTA. I don\u2019t know how to tell you this but it\u2019s not going to end when she turns 18. You say you don\u2019t plan on putting her out, so is the plan to wait for her to do something super stupid and hope she goes to prison? Because that\u2019s what looms on her horizon. You know your wife is going to look at you to rescue her \u201cbaby\u201d AGAIN. What\u2019s the plan when that happens? You should start working on that now.", "...um, yeah, if for no other reason than calling her \"the girl,\" YTA.  You clearly didn't adopt her, so \\*you\\* aren't facing any legal consequences from her actions, your wife is.  Don't put in your money if you don't want to, but the contempt you have for this child is palpable; I'm not shocked she kicks up rough.", "An 18 year old is no longer running on hormones. This behavior can not be justified", "Step parenting isn't just being a piggy bank. I'm guessing that's what you are, based on your comment.", ">Yeah but at 18 she's a legal adult and he can wash his hands of her\n\nUm, at no point was he legally responsible for her. He *chose* to allow get married to someone that brought her into his life, and there is no indicated that the mother has any intention to cut her off, so I don't know what you or he thinks is going to suddenly change", "NTA but op is a sucker for signing up for this", "How can they have shared assets when they have been married for just 2 years and together for 3?", "According to his edit, you were right on the money: he owned the house prior to the marriage and refinanced it to pull equity out for attorney fees to keep the stepdaughter out of jail. Whooboy, he's in for a rough ride over the next few \"fledging\" years.", "This is why stepparents should get more recognition and understanding than they typically do. Treat and love the kid like your own, but none of the say.", "So I originally made my comment before OP made his edit stating the house was actually his alone. \n\nBut their shared asset I presumed was the house (because OP said \u201cour house\u201d). It doesn\u2019t take 2-3 years to buy a house, and in many places any property bought during the time of the marriage is a marital asset, regardless of who pays.", "He's not obligated to do that and his wife's rule is not to parent or punish her.\n\nHe can offer to help her but it sounds like he doesn't want to and that is completely valid, she's not his problem", "u/loudsignificance658 is a bot", "u/LoudSignificance658 is a bot.", "I\u2019m not saying OP should do this, but take kids out of the equation and I think I\u2019d rather be single, if I was financially independent.

Let him have her.", "Then you just don\u2019t understand women like this. They want their cake and eat it too. They\u2019ll push responsibility off on you but then freak the fuck out if you hold them or their spawn responsible. They want your money not your input.", "Yes, there is. And he can when he needs to. But usually it's more effective all around if I do it. I wouldn't ever tell someone who was part of the family *not* to be a parent to my kids; I sometimes need them to be! Last year, I spent four days in the hospital. My husband looked after the kids without me, and did just fine. If I couldn't trust him to do that when he had to, with everything that might be involved, I would never have married him.", "Who hurt you?", "Ironically OP is the one bailing her out. He's the one that mortgaged his own house that he solely owns and he bought the 2 cars she wrecked and got a DUI with. Maybe it was at the behest of his wife, but he's still the one doing it.", "A night in jail might honestly be a nice reprieve from all of this lol", "OP updated. They didn't use joint money. That was all his money. She got a DUI in his old car that he gave her after she wrecked her mom's old car. The house they mortgaged was solely OP's and part of premarital assets. Dude is as much of an enabler as the mom is at this point.", "One of his friends probably just talked to his wife and she was talking to his wife. I mean it is nothing to be concerned and he maybe did not make a secret out of it.", "I agree!  I wouldn't marry a single parent, mom or dad, because you are not just marrying the person. You are also becoming entangled with the children's lives and in turn with the non-custodial parents' life. That's too many responsibilities and relationships to maintain for me!", "If he and his wife have joint finances, he very well could be paying for his step-daughter's future messes after she turns 18. Just because she'll be a legal adult doesn't mean her mom won't continue to bail her out. They need to separate finances *now* or start saving for the divorce.", "He\u2019s never been legally responsible for her unless he adopted her. Marrying her mother does not make him the child\u2019s father. In any sense.", ">Yeah but at 18 she's a legal adult and he can wash his hands of her.\n\nNot really if mommy decides to still pay for all her legal troubles, given that she already re-mortgaged the house...", "Which was nice and appropriate. But still, where\u2019s the bio father? If OP\u2019s going to be her father he has to make clear that baby daddy ain\u2019t contributing and accept the full responsibility which is NOT going to be only until she turns 18.", "Gold diggers!", "What? You don\u2019t like the truth? Are you trying to imply that there aren\u2019t horrible women who take advantage of people?", "Straw man argument, sure there's individual women who are garbage (that's not something restricted to a specific gender) but you made a generalisation which, as phrased, includes all women. \n\nSo yeah, you clearly have personal history that you're not handling in a healthy way."]}
