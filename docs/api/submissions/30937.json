In total, with just immediate family on both sides, I have 24 people (including my son) to get gifts for. I have tried to suggest doing a white elephant or secret Santa to cut down the list + cost, however one side of my family said no and the other agreed but ended up buying everyone gifts anyway.

Best of luck.", "NTA. A way to tell them to stick it nicely would be \"Sorry, but I find myself severely limited this year in being able to participate. So not only will I not be giving anyone but (son) a gift this year, I will not be accepting gifts for myself. None taken, none given. If you find that it bothers you that I'm removing myself from the gift aspect this year, maybe ask yourself why. If you choose to punish (my son) by not giving him gifts to spite me, you go right ahead. That will tell both of us where we stand. Because right now? I'm on the edge and none of you are on the stable side offering to pull me somewhere safe. You're all just expecting me to fly. I can't. So since the actual meaning of the holidays are lost on you, which is family and togetherness, I think it's best that I be with the family that matters to me most. And that's the one that isn't expecting me to put myself in debt for a frigging bauble.\"", "NTA - You are not obliged to give anyone a gift and the standards your family are setting are frankly insane. Minimum 25 dollars with over 20 people who you need to buy gifts for is a huge investment, that's over 600 dollars from your budget and that's not even factoring in the time spent. I don't know anyone who does gifts like that for the entire extended family, because it's just far too expensive. \n\nIt's very reasonable to say that your budget can't cover that extravagant a Christmas. You could give small handmade gifts to some people if you really wanted, or just do as you said and not do gifts this year. The only option available that would make you an asshole would be spending money you can't afford on gifts for people who are being really unsupportive to you", "NTA. You say can\u2019t afford it.  Don\u2019t put yourself in debt for Christmas. If family lives close you can think of nice things to do for them perhaps, or things to make for them.   Not sure if you have the time for that though.", "How dare these people expect you to go into debt to satisfy some imaginary dollar minimum for gifts?! When times are tough, you find out who your friends are, and people show you who they really are. You've now learned alot about your family - and some of them are damn mercernaries, including dear old grandma.

What pisses me off is that people think Christmas is about presents. It\u2019s about family. And for your family to be upset is just shameful.

That is Christmas! So sorry to hear half your family are Scrooges.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t give this a second thought and maybe take a break from your \u201cfamily.\u201d As others have mentioned, please look into local programs and you are an amazing mom if no one has told you.

Nana don't need a gift, she's already ungrateful.", "NTA. People like this -- who insist on gifts for every single adult in an extended family -- are ridiculous. In my family, we just do gifts for the kids and haven't done adult gifts in YEARS -- not for financial hardship reasons, but just because it seems like a waste of time and effort when all we really want is to eat, drink and spend time together. Once we stopped stressing over presents and who wants what and how much to spend and \"will they like it??\", the holiday became SO much more enjoyable and relaxing. It can be easy to mistake \"this is how we've always done it\" for \"this is the only way to do it.\" I'm sorry that your family is putting you in this position and making you feel guilty about it, and that they won't compromise for a single year. It's also insane to set a price MINIMUM, not a maximum. I mean honestly, that's nuts, who does that? Personally, if my family demanded gifts like that and devalued my presence and circumstances in that way, I probably just wouldn't go. Stand your ground on this one, don't cave and then have to start the year struggling even harder financially. It's not worth it. Think long-term stability, not short-term placating of people who already seem to have more than their share.  \n\n\nAnd I'm sorry you're caught in the catch-22 of making \"too much\" to need help just because you're working even harder than before.

You're just holding your head above water. \nHonestly Christmas isn't about gifts anyway, it's about spending time with people you love. \n\nWe have bad Santa in our family with a spending limit and it's a hoot. \n\nMy partner's family don't and it's tedious and expensive. \n\nBake a load of cookies if you have time these are an Australian staple. \n\nGood luck.

You're doing the right thing and if someone is not understanding they're TA. It's horrible that Christmas has turned into a time when people end up stressed and under pressure to purchase gifts.

The money my mother was giving me was coming out of savings she had to pay for my brothers headstone. Both of my parents were on disability due to ill health. I was living hand to mouth to feed my child and keep her warm and well cared for. When the friends returned from their holiday, I met up with one. All stories and \"you should have come\", when I told her I was literally borrowing money to keep a roof over my head and I couldn't possibly have gotten the money for a holiday from anywhere, her solution was that I should have borrowed to go on holidays because that's what she did. She borrowed from her father, who owned many businesses and wouldn't miss a few thousand from his bank account. I could not get her to understand that I was borrowing for an essential bill,  that had to be paid or myself and my child were homeless,  from a limited resource that was also something my mother had scrimped and saved for. And that her father paying out for her holiday was a luxury and a privilege, that our circumstances were not the same. She never got it because when some people say they can't afford something they really mean they don't have money this second  but they know where to get some and other people mean they aren't eating tonight because there literally isn't any money. Why don't you send out a request for everybody to get together to pay a bill for you and let them know of they pay that bill you will be able to afford a bar of chocolate for everybody because the bills just keep coming and you are trying your best to make sure you can keep looking after your child.

I\u2019ve vocalized this all to her and she told me to focus on my son and if they don\u2019t like it then oh well.", "Also don\u2019t discount good quality toys from thrift shops for your son. I buy them for my young grandchildren for when they come to visit along with puzzles and games for the older one", "You wrote this so beautifully! Great idea about the park!!", "Years ago in my super broke days I started making salted caramel sauce. It\u2019s cheap to make. These days it costs about $30 for 50 4-oz jars. Back then it cost half that. The jars do cost more but the first year I did it I used recycled baby food jars and other odds and ends. My family loves this so much every year starting about thanksgiving I get the jars back so they can be refilled. I can afford more now, but this is what they want. \n\nOP\u2019s family are materialistic. Good gifts don\u2019t have to cost a fortune. And the audacity of calling a single mother working three jobs lazy. I don\u2019t have words to describe how messed up that is.", "Same at my house and I live in the USA. Only the kids get gifts. The adults make the food, do the cleanup and bring desserts and sometimes funny ornaments but that's it. I'm not a big fan of Christmas for reasons I won't get into here but I enjoy the kids' excited faces, the lights, the decorations and the snow outside!", "I'm in the US and nobody in my family buys for adults.  The Christmas gathering is the gift.  I don't get all these materialistic people wanting \"things\" all the time.", "I don't think this is a US thing at all - in my family, other than immediate family, holiday gifts have always only been about the kids.", "This is what the hubs and I do. \n\nIt's standard in his culture to get gifts for everyone. One year, we decided we didn't want to and told everyone we were getting gifts for kids only and to please not get us gifts. We have no kids. \n\nThat turned into all the rest of the adults following our example. Gifts for kids only.", "I have felt that since I\u2019ve had kids. I\u2019m from the US but as soon as I had kids, it was all about the kids. I don\u2019t feel the need to buy everyone else presents and vice versa, focus on my kids. I tried this when they were born. Now they are 18/21 and one set of the grandparents brought it up last year like it was a new idea (their idea!) lol. \n\nWhat I did every year was create a digital scrapbook of the kids year in photos with captions of what they did (first day of school, sports they played, etc) and gave it to each set of grandparent and great grandparent. That was their present.", "American here, I was shocked by this whole question. My family doesn\u2019t do gifts for every adult in the family, just the kids. I mean my spouse and I will exchange gifts, but my siblings and I don\u2019t. We send gifts for the nieces and nephews only. Her adult relatives should be helping her with groceries, not sticking their hands out for gifts. Abominable.", "I don't think this is a common American thing outside of some subcultures. Gifts for the minor children, maybe a small thing between the adults but often not even that. Pick a name out of hat gift round robin. Expecting a young mom to buy 24 family members gifts, absolutely not a US thing. NTA", "I have been there.\n\nSend out a message to every single person. Tell them you will only be buying for your son and your mom going forward. Tell them, \u201cplease take whatever money you would have spent on me and use it to buy something nice for yourself.\u201d", "Only purchase for your son. That lamp sounds like it will bring him a lot of joy. That alone is worth it. Your Nana sounds like quite a piece of work.", "As an autistic adult, a lamp like that that could help with meltdowns/being overstimulated as a kid would have been amazing! Do what you can to make sure your son is taken care of. Who cares if you spend your money on expensive gifts for your son. He\u2019s your fucking son. Your family sound super entitled", "To continue on this, anytime I have taken him to his developmental pediatrician, they have this bubble lamp in the lobby and he is OBSESSED. Every time we walk in, he gets very excited and stares at it smiling until we are called back. Knowing that something so simple can bring him so much joy makes it worth it to save up every penny to get him that. Not because it\u2019s expensive for me, but because it\u2019s something I know he will truly love.", "Ffs that's almost a necessity for your son. You\nR nana is an a$$. Make something crafty if you have the time or get them a card -maybe a funny one - so they don't feel left out. Depending how many kids there bare in your family put a bit of money in the kids cards", "I can't believe the pressure you are under to provide Christmas presents for others. You are working three jobs to provide for your son. Realistically, he is your priority. You owe no further explanation to anyone. It time to start new Christmas traditions if your extended family won't re consider their expectations.", "You are a survivor and a rock star, too!", "They also think someone who is working three jobs is lazy. How they came to that conclusion is beyond outrageous", "Seriously! And to have a gift dollar minimum? Dictating what you have to spend!! \n\nI've been so poor in the early years that I cut up old Christmas cards to use as gift tags because pretty gift tags were too expensive. You simply cut out something pretty on the card, not using the part that someone wrote on the other side. I would cut something using \"fancy\" cuts, like scalloped edges. Still something I love to do to this day!", "My brother used to have my nehpews draw us a picture and they would frame it as a present. Meant to much to me than something bought. Frames are reasonably priced or you could thrift some", "Salt dough handprints/footprints & painted like snowmen , reindeer, etc! We made these as gifts for some family last year (my son's first Christmas).", "Lol", "50 hours a week is overworking already. Please don't even bother to bake cookies for your family as suggested here. They don't deserve it.\n\nChristmas is a make up thing. No one is an AH for not having Christmas.", "My three autistic braincells felt dopamine for the first time in six years just now", "Exactly. Kids love thr lights, fireworks (over here, fireworks start around 8pm on the 24th and don't seem to stop until closer 1am on the 25th. It looks great, it's fun, and the last few years it's not as loud as other years, so that's cool too. \n\nI truly can't imagine telling my gran that I just can't buy gifts for everyone and her telling me to \"just make it happen\". She would have probably have tried to give me money to make ends meet, not caring about Christmas one bit.", "They might not all be materialistic. Once a family gets into this pattern of giving everyone gifts, it's really hard to stop.", "Honestly in my family, the adults are relieved not to get a bunch of stuff they don\u2019t want and not to have to figure out gifts for the other adults (who can largely buy things for themselves if they want them). It\u2019s hard enough buying for the teenagers!", "It's definitely a tradition in some US families, but I don't know how widespread it is.", "Oh, my! How creative and sweet!", "That\u2019s what I used to do as well, make a scrapbook or find cheap photo deals and make a calendar for family, also made quite a few collages for my dad. They always loved it, had lots of pictures of the grand and great grandkids. \n\nThey knew I was a single mom and wanted me to focus on my kids, and that\u2019s what they did as well. My dad always being the sweetest would by me something anyway, usually something small but meaningful lol", "If you\u2019re working 3 jobs, getting a really impactful gift for your son should be the priority. I would go as far as saying no gifts for any adults. You\u2019re working 3 jobs to stay afloat, I think this year they will have to get over it. Why would anyone who loves you or your son want you to struggle just to get some stuff that they won\u2019t remember in 3 months?", "Awwww. Well, you made such a beautiful comment and I forgot to thank you for the support. :-)", "I can't imagine that, either. Maybe there's some early stage dementia because she sounds so mean to her own grandchild and great grandson. Ooof.", "There\u2019s not really any need but your welcome? Sorry idk how you have to say thank you instead of literally anyone else, sorry I\u2019m brain dead and my three brain cells look like if you took a screenshot of a smear frame from that episode of Bluey where they go to the movies and bingo stands under a hand dryer", ":-D", "Gotta love bluey", "Lol", "I mean you do kinda have to, if you haven\u2019t watched it watch it right now"]}
