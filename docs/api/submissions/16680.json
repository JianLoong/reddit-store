{"id": 16680, "submission_id": "13bf9bl", "title": "AITA for not driving 4+ hours to see my sisters kids?", "selftext": "My sister has been having a hard time with her kids lately. She's been stressed and she's frustrated that no relatives are spending time with her kids more (or babysitting them) for her. \n\nHere's the thing: I do spend time with her kids. I see them probably about once a month or once every couple of months. I live 2+ hours away and visiting costs a lot on gas and time, and I'm incredibly busy as a senior in college with a part time job. I spent almost every weekend with her firstborn, but I haven't had near the free time recently. And honestly, I don't even want to. My family (mostly mom and dad but sister too) has a history of being toxic and stressful, so visits end in tears more often than not. I visit for holidays and other occasions but lately I've been avoiding the whole ordeal more for my own mental health.\n\nI love my neices, dont get me wrong. I adore them. But I hate that she's acting like I have some kind of obligation to spend MORE time with them when I feel like I spend a normal amount considering how far away I live and how hard it is to travel in and out of Seattle where she lives. I don't have cash to burn on gas every other weekend, or the energy to spare babysitting her 2 yr old and 4 month old.\n\nSo I guess, basically, am I the a hole for not spending more time with her kids in spite of how much it stresses me out?\n\nUpdate: I took some of your guys' advice and set a boundary. I told we might be able to aim for once a month visit-wise but I don't think its fair that she expects so much from me/is implying I'm a bad relative for not going out of my way. I'll let you know what she says tomorrow.\n\nUpdate 2: A rare happy ending for this sub! My sister and I had a long talk and she realized how she was coming across/how demanding it was. Shes been stressed and was in a vulnerable place when she said everything before. We got to the heart of it and we agreed on doing video calls more often, since driving down is so difficult. At the end she actually DID just want to see me more/have me more involved with the kiddos, she just ended up venting some frustration my way.

It's not your kid, why should you have to babysit at all?! It's pretty clear that is literally all she wants you to visit for. \n\nPersonally, I'd visit even less after the complaining. If someone complains about a favour I am doing them then they can f*ck off and I won't do it at all. But then I'm petty like that.", "NTA. Its your wish to help or not to help. \nShe just needs your help and time, not the relationship /bonding with children. But doesn't your sister have a husband's side family to help out?", "NTA- I\u2019m in college too and there\u2019s NO WAY I\u2019d be making that drive every weekend to watch someone else\u2019s kids. Heck I love my sister to bits and pieces but I could never. You have too much on your plate right now to be spending 4+ hours driving all together and watching kids when you\u2019re literally in college.", "NTA. Please, for your own sanity, continue setting healthy boundaries.", "NTA, she is just trying to guilt people into being free babysitters.", "NTA\n\n   You're a young person who has her own life.", "[removed]", "NTA. They're her kids, not yours. You're under no obligation to visit on a particularly frequent basis, especially as it's so inconvenient to do so. I think it's important that you set boundaries. It doesn't mean you don't love them, it just means you have your own life.", "NTA It sounds like your sister wants more support as a mom of an infant and a toddler. You are not obligated to be that support. You are not **able** to give that support. Based on that timetable, I'm guessing you might attend WWU. My sibling did as well, and we only visited occasionally because I lived just outside Seattle. Visiting once a month would have been a large commitment! For babysitting? Not unless it was an emergency! \n\nDon't let her guilt you into making more trips. Especially if those trips are bad for you.", ">I'm incredibly busy as a senior in college with a part time job.\n\nHow do you have any free weekends? NTA.", "NTA\n\nIf you do want to help though, don\u2019t underestimate how much help you distracting them on FaceTime for 15 minutes could be. Something to consider if it\u2019s just the time and travel costs stopping you, but you\u2019re absolutely not obliged.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Way more time. Really, cut it down. You need time for yourself. She needs a payed baby sitter.", "NTA.  For your own mental health, just don't answer the phone.  Text her back if she leaves a message with -- \"Sorry, so swamped.  I'll catch up with you this weekend in a bit.\"  But don't answer the phone until you are at a point where you can afford to drive out and when you actually have the time to do it.  Don't blow your future because your sister has kids.  She's stressed, but, unless it's an emergency, take care of yourself.", "It\u2019s nice that you were able to spend a lot of time with the kids before. Frankly, she should understand that a college senior has a lot of other obligations (let alone other things they\u2019d rather be doing). If she doesn\u2019t get that, it\u2019s not your job to keep explaining it. \n\nParenting a 2 yr old and 4 month old is hard- it\u2019s no wonder why there aren\u2019t a lot of babysitters to help out.", "NTA but maybe look at video calling once a week. My brother used to call for his boys as I lived on the other side of the country\n Calls were normally only about 5 mins long where the kids would tell me about their new favourite toy, then say bye and hang up on me. Was always pretty funny! My sister made finger socks puppets and would make up plays on the video calls. The boys loved it and we created a special bond even being a 5 hour flight away. Maybe this will placate your sister without you having to drive.", ">If someone complains about a favour I am doing them then they can f*ck off and I won't do it at all. But then I'm petty like that.\n\nI don't think that's petty. It's normal", "Nope. The grandparents on her husbands side dont visit, and she says that myself and my sister need to \"step it up\" because they \"dont have any other relatives involved\" and that \"family is important\". \n\nShe thinks the only people who care or visit are our parents, but as both of them only live an hour away from her and both aren't even full time workers/are halfway retired, they have a lot of spare time. Her kids' other aunts/uncles aren't involved even a little, which I think she is resenting us for now, for whatever reason.\n\nSpecifically, she says our mom does the most, but our mom only has to work one day a month, and it's a job that's mostly a hobby for her.", "My general rule is: unless it\u2019s an important event (birthday, father\u2019s/mother\u2019s day, Easter, etc) or a life or death emergency, I\u2019ll see them in the breaks between semesters.", "She doesn't, that's why she's so frustrated. The \"only\" people she thinks are involved with her kids are our parents. My mom only has to go to work once a month, and my dad gets off of work at noon. Neither of them are full time anything, they are almost fully retired.", "That sounds like a solid compromise, ill see what she thinks.", "Well she needs to move closer to family if she needs help that much. I live nowhere near family with kids and I\u2019m doing fine.", "NTA and great update.", "NTA and even after the update. Visits go both ways. If she wants to see you more, she does have to drive to you, too!\n\nIf she wants you to babysit, she should help out with the costs of driving or being the kiddos to your place (if this would be option). I am glad that she was able to see how demanding she is but in the end those are her kids and she has to make amends of she wants you to be more involved.", "happy endings are good.", "NTA", "Some parents have a hard time understanding that just because their kids are the most important thing in the world *to them*, that they aren't to everyone else in the family.  Often leads to unrealistic expectations and then resentment when those expectations aren't met."]}
