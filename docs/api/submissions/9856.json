We got it sold out!! \n\nWe all met up with him for lunch beforehand and gave him his little gifts, he said he appreciates it but it\u2019ll take awhile to trust us again, which is very valid considering how we\u2019ve been treating him. \n\nHe also introduced us to his boyfriend! They\u2019re adorable together. Mom and dad thanked him for being someone Row could turn to when he needed someone.  \nThey did great, they even got a standing ovation at the end. \n\nRow did injure his ankle slightly in the beginning of act one during his first solo but played it off amazingly. I\u2019m proud of him, and it was amazing to formally meet his boyfriend. \n\nMom and dad sat him down in front of all of us and apologized for how they treated him and promised they\u2019d do better. \n\nAfter the show he came up and hugged me while crying to thank me. I told him it was all you guys. Thank you guys again.", "created_utc": 1676298504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1119pax/update_aita_for_telling_my_adopted_brother_hes/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Thank you for the update.

I'm glad you all went to support him and things are getting better!", "I just read your original post, and I am so happy to see that you saw the error of your ways, rallied with your family, and showed up.\n\nYou all still have work to do to mend the trust that was broken, but this was a great first step!", "Respect :)", "i suspect this new dynamic wont last very long... hopefully row is prepared for that", "I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying... Good job OP", "Hi! I\u2019m Row. It still hurts a little but nothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before! I landed a little hard on my act 1 solo and twisted it. I made it through act 2 though. The director said I played it off really well so that\u2019s all that matters \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af My boyfriend has been making sure I\u2019m icing it and it\u2019s elevated."]}
