We got it sold out!! \n\nWe all met up with him for lunch beforehand and gave him his little gifts, he said he appreciates it but it\u2019ll take awhile to trust us again, which is very valid considering how we\u2019ve been treating him. \n\nHe also introduced us to his boyfriend! They\u2019re adorable together. Mom and dad thanked him for being someone Row could turn to when he needed someone.  \nThey did great, they even got a standing ovation at the end. \n\nRow did injure his ankle slightly in the beginning of act one during his first solo but played it off amazingly. I\u2019m proud of him, and it was amazing to formally meet his boyfriend. \n\nMom and dad sat him down in front of all of us and apologized for how they treated him and promised they\u2019d do better. \n\nAfter the show he came up and hugged me while crying to thank me. I told him it was all you guys. Thank you guys again.", "created_utc": 1676298504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1119pax/update_aita_for_telling_my_adopted_brother_hes/", "score": 327, "replies": ["Thank you for the update. Idk about anyone else but it makes my heart so happy when people are able to accept their AH part in the situation and try to rectify it.", "Yay! I\u2019m happy for you all, that\u2019s really nice of you guys. I hope you guys can continue to mend your relationship. Is his foot doing okay?", "I love these kinds of updates!!!  And the original Y-T-A just got turned into an NTA  amazing sis.", "A great update for once! I'm glad you all went to support him and things are getting better!", "I just read your original post, and I am so happy to see that you saw the error of your ways, rallied with your family, and showed up.\n\nYou all still have work to do to mend the trust that was broken, but this was a great first step!", "Respect :)", "i suspect this new dynamic wont last very long... hopefully row is prepared for that", "I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying... Good job OP", "Hi! I\u2019m Row. It still hurts a little but nothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before! I landed a little hard on my act 1 solo and twisted it. I made it through act 2 though. The director said I played it off really well so that\u2019s all that matters \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af My boyfriend has been making sure I\u2019m icing it and it\u2019s elevated.", "Somebody accepting their judgment and putting a bunch of effort into repairing the damage almost never happens. It's good to see.", "These are the best kind of updates! Makes me believe that there really are some good people in this world :)", "Still don\u2019t know why your parents decided to adopt a boy then treated him differently. Why must it take a reddit post before you all wake up?", "Talking to other kids who went through the system that I go to school with, it happens more often than people think. Some people adopt for the wrong reasons, some feel uncomfortable as the kid gets older. \n\nOne dude said his adoptive parents looked at him more as a charity case than their child. I do plan to ask them when we get some time alone though.", "I\u2019m not sure but I\u2019m willing to give them a chance. The relationship with them is just as much in my hands as it is theirs. All I know right now is I appreciate their efforts and them accepting Ash and My relationship.", "Did you read the original post and see where the sibling commented their appreciation for everyone sticking up for them and how happy they were that their family was coming out to support them \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d *waterworks initiated* \n\nSometimes all people need is an outside perspective to make positive strides in their relationships \ud83e\udd72"]}
