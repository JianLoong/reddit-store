We got it sold out!! \n\nWe all met up with him for lunch beforehand and gave him his little gifts, he said he appreciates it but it\u2019ll take awhile to trust us again, which is very valid considering how we\u2019ve been treating him. \n\nHe also introduced us to his boyfriend! They\u2019re adorable together. Mom and dad thanked him for being someone Row could turn to when he needed someone.  \nThey did great, they even got a standing ovation at the end. \n\nRow did injure his ankle slightly in the beginning of act one during his first solo but played it off amazingly. I\u2019m proud of him, and it was amazing to formally meet his boyfriend. \n\nMom and dad sat him down in front of all of us and apologized for how they treated him and promised they\u2019d do better. \n\nAfter the show he came up and hugged me while crying to thank me. I told him it was all you guys. Thank you guys again.", "created_utc": 1676298504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1119pax/update_aita_for_telling_my_adopted_brother_hes/", "score": 1186, "replies": ["Thank you for the update. Idk about anyone else but it makes my heart so happy when people are able to accept their AH part in the situation and try to rectify it.", "Yay! I\u2019m happy for you all, that\u2019s really nice of you guys. I hope you guys can continue to mend your relationship. Is his foot doing okay?", "I love these kinds of updates!!!  And the original Y-T-A just got turned into an NTA  amazing sis.", "A great update for once! I'm glad you all went to support him and things are getting better!", "I just read your original post, and I am so happy to see that you saw the error of your ways, rallied with your family, and showed up.\n\nYou all still have work to do to mend the trust that was broken, but this was a great first step!", "Respect :)", "i suspect this new dynamic wont last very long... hopefully row is prepared for that", "I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying... Good job OP", "Hi! I\u2019m Row. It still hurts a little but nothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before! I landed a little hard on my act 1 solo and twisted it. I made it through act 2 though. The director said I played it off really well so that\u2019s all that matters \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af My boyfriend has been making sure I\u2019m icing it and it\u2019s elevated.", "Somebody accepting their judgment and putting a bunch of effort into repairing the damage almost never happens. It's good to see.", "These are the best kind of updates! Makes me believe that there really are some good people in this world :)", "Still don\u2019t know why your parents decided to adopt a boy then treated him differently. Why must it take a reddit post before you all wake up?", "Talking to other kids who went through the system that I go to school with, it happens more often than people think. Some people adopt for the wrong reasons, some feel uncomfortable as the kid gets older. \n\nOne dude said his adoptive parents looked at him more as a charity case than their child. I do plan to ask them when we get some time alone though.", "I\u2019m not sure but I\u2019m willing to give them a chance. The relationship with them is just as much in my hands as it is theirs. All I know right now is I appreciate their efforts and them accepting Ash and My relationship.", "Did you read the original post and see where the sibling commented their appreciation for everyone sticking up for them and how happy they were that their family was coming out to support them \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d *waterworks initiated* \n\nSometimes all people need is an outside perspective to make positive strides in their relationships \ud83e\udd72", "This is amazing! And I'll be looking out for Rowan in upcoming Ballet competitions. Male lead is SUCH a big deal for ballet, you can only know just how much if you're a dancer in that world really. He must be so very talented! I hope to see him tour in a major company (or whatever his goal is) one day!\nGo Rowan! Smash your goals & don't let anything hold you back! Dance on!", "Good update here!", "[removed]", "My dance/theater teachers always told us if we fall or make a mistake, keep going like nothing happened and most people won't even realize it did. I'm guessing that's exactly what you did and most people will only have seen an awesome performance. Great job!\n\nI hope your family always remembers the lesson they've learned and continues to show you the respect and love you deserve. Best of luck to you in the future! \ud83d\udc9c", "Ngl they did a really good step in the right direction, all of them, I hope it\u2019s just gonna be step forwards now for you and for them too, I\u2019m gonna be pissed if one of them go backwards, but right now they did a really good job and I hope they understand in which direction they need to go to make things better with you !", "Yes I did. That is why I posted a comment... \ud83d\ude01", "I remember this post. This is wonderful to read \ud83d\udc9b", "Done", "What a beautiful update! So glad you are coming around as a family", "This so nice. But I hope you all really stick it out for the long haul. The fact that you were so oblivious before, hadn\u2019t even thought of the obvious and then you made\none big gesture  makes me concerned this may be a one time thing. It makes you feel better and you\u2019ll all go back to the way you were. \nPlease continue to think about how things got this way and how you can really make space for him as a brother in the family. \nAnd if not - let him go and get care and comfort elsewhere.", "I'm glad you turned it around OP, it's hard to see where he would be coming from seeing as your parents likely went to all of your events or tried. I'm glad he felt safe to introduce you all to his bf and things are on the mend and I truly hope everyone took this as a teachable moment and will do better in the future.", "I'm so glad that this turned out happily! Best wishes to you and your family!", "Good on you, Row and OP.", "Keep it up! Like your brother said, it will take a while, and this one green gesture just beginning. Because she inches of making this a day today/regular interaction.", "Thank you. I love him and I want to be there for him.", "Ummm, I\u2019m sobbing like a baby!  I might as well have just watched a commercial for the ASPCA!!!!", "I'm not crying my eyes are just leaking water!", "I hope you stick it out. The fact that you were so oblivious before and hadn\u2019t even thought of the obvious and then you made\none big gesture  tells me this may be a one time thing to make you feel better and you\u2019ll all go back to the way you were. \nPlease continue to think about how things got this way and how you can really make space for him as a brother in the family. \nAnd if not - let go and get care and comfort elsewhere.", "I think that\u2019s exactly what he did. I only noticed because he was limping after the show and Ash told me what happened", "It's honestly one of my favorite things about live theater. I once saw a performance of 1776 where one of the actors mistakenly delivered a line from near the end of the play. Without missing a beat, another actor shouted, \"Sir, you are *out of order*! If you wouldn't mind joining the rest of us on page 5?\" And it worked! The actor quickly realized what it meant and delivered the correct line, and everything moved on without the audience suspecting a thing.", "Yep, that\u2019s what has me in ugly cry mode!", "Super religious, bias issues about him going into ballet, probably trying to avoid dealing with the possibility (reality) that he\u2019s gay or bisexual, etc.  But it seems they at least acknowledge how wrong they were and are making a start towards actively trying to be better.  And that is a good start at least.  I just hope they keep it up!", "Bot. Comment stolen from u/adrecent7210. Downvote and report!", "No I\u2019m crying. But yes, I am bisexual. The way our parents have talked in the past about the lgbtq+ community made it feel like I couldn\u2019t really talk to them. \n\nThey sent us all (siblings) to the same arts boarding school for highschool, that\u2019s where I met Ash. He was my roommate and in the same dance program. That\u2019s also when we started dating XD we just celebrated 3 years together. He was the hardest secret I\u2019ve ever had to keep. \n\nThen when we got accepted to the same college we requested to be roommates again and that got approved.", "I\u2019m so glad you have had the chance to introduce him to family!  I can imagine you had all the anxiety of being adopted combined with all the anxiety of being bisexual (and bisexual individuals are often pressured to just conform to the cisgender identity and sexual preference since they \u201ccan.\u201d)\n\nI\u2019m so glad your family was able to show you that they care, and your reddit friends are here for you too!", "I love that you were able to reflect and empathize. These are life lessons you are learning at a young age.", "This update is so wholesoem", "Awwwwww you've got me ugly crying now!! \n\nYou took all the comments, tough as some of those were to hear, and you took them on board. You reflected on them, and your family dynamic, and then turned into a literal Superhero. You took a shitty situation and you turned it around beautifully. You should be soooooooo proud of yourself. Hell, I don't even know you and I am proud of you! \n\nYou are an awesome sister and I think you can look forward to a wonderful relationship with your brother going forward. And you have paved the way for your whole family to heal and have wonderful relationships going forward. \n\nThanks so much for the update. You warmed my heart and made me happy! X", "I'm really blown away how cut onions come across the internet waves.  lol.", "That is absolutely HILARIOUS. I love it. Nice quick thinking on that actor's part! Love theater is the best.", "Oh thats awesome! Well done family!", "This post seems very fake", "Thank you so much!  Ngl I did cry a little when the cast list came out XD I definitely want to tour eventually.  As dumb as this sounds during the foster care/adoption process dance was the one reason I didn\u2019t do anything bad. It was my one sense of stability all that time if that makes any sense.", "Thank you sm! I love him and don\u2019t want to lose him. Those comments reallyyy opened my eyes. He\u2019s still a little standoffish understandably, but I hope he realizes this isn\u2019t going to be a temporary thing. We\u2019ve been talking a lot since the show and it\u2019s going so well. \n\nI\u2019m really proud of Row and Ash both. Ash (Rowan\u2019s boyfriend) was one of Ash\u2019s supporting characters (not sure if I worded that correctly but his role was one of princes companions) They both did so well! I reallyyyy appreciate everyone\u2019s advice.  \n\nWe\u2019re all taking the boys out for dinner tomorrow, along with Ash\u2019s parents and hanging out. It\u2019ll be our first time meeting them knowing Ash and Rowan are in a relationship. I am a little worried about how our parents will react just because this has been a long term relationship and Ash\u2019s parents have known first. But my other brothers and I all agree their relationship with Rowan doesn\u2019t have to define our relationship with him and he\u2019s our brother no matter what.", "Yeah! I\u2019m still a little cautious but they\u2019re not forcing anything. I did tell them in the beginning I have as much power in this relationship as they do, so I can decide if I don\u2019t feel comfortable with it and they need to respect my feelings too.  They seemed to understand that.", "That\u2019s amazing oh my god XD"]}
