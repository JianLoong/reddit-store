She has two kids from a previous relationship, Calvin (12M) and Carly (15F), and I also had two kids, Cole (13M) and Callum (17M). Both of our previous partners died when our kids were really young.\n\nCassie and Carly have a very different relationship than the rest of us. Carly still calls my wife \u2018Mama\u2019 or \u2018Mommy\u2019 even though Calvin just calls him mom. They still cuddle together and sometimes I get home to Carly and her sleeping in our bed. Cassie still packs her lunch every morning and personally emails her teachers if Cassie has a bad grade, neither of which she does with any of the boys. She definitely favors Carly over the boys but has assured me that it was just different since they were both girls.\n\nThis morning Carly woke me and my wife up at 4am saying she had a nightmare. The last time I was woken up by a nightmare was when Cole was 9 and Callum was 8. I was tryna sleep after a 12 hour shift and was a bit agitated, however I waited until Carly and Callum headed to school to speak with my wife. I told her that I understand that the kid needs comfort but she\u2019s also 15. In a few years she has to go off to college and won\u2019t have her mother to placate her whenever she needs it. She called me a douchebag for trying to deny her daughter comfort but I told her that Carly can\u2019t be a well adjusted adult if she relies on her mom constantly. She stormed off to her mother\u2019s house after our fight and left me alone to get our two moody middle schoolers up by myself.

So what that she calls her mummy?  she's the only girl, with three brothers/stepbrothers, she sought comfort from another woman and again, this has happened *ONCE* in five years????\n\nI'm getting a \" you tell your sons that boys don't cry\" vibe from you.  how dare a human being seek comfort when upset because it was momentarily inconvenient for *you.*\n\nGrow up.", "YTA Their relationship is just fine, and guess what? Adults sometimes need to lean on other people, too. Your complaints about her calling her mother \u2018mama\u2019 or \u2018mommy\u2019 are really weird, too.

She's a child. She needed her mother's comfort. It's good that they have a strong relationship. Most teen daughters and mothers clash. My mother and I constantly fought. Her daughter isn't waking you up on the daily or even the weekly. Mind your kids, and she'll mind hers.", "YTA. Why are you so salty that a mother and daughter have a good relationship? Jealous that her children feel comfortable enough with her to come to her for comfort? How many times do your children get nightmares but not feel close enough to you to ask for your comfort?\n\nYou disguise **your** problem behind the worry about Carly not being able to rely on her mother when she goes off to college, but when she goes to college that \"issue\" will solve itself.

Everyone needs a hug sometimes.", "I think everyone voting Y T A is focusing a little too hard on what Carly calls her mother and isn\u2019t looking at the big picture here. Because you\u2019re right. Carly is in for a rude awakening when she gets to college and doesn\u2019t have a lick of independence. It\u2019s NTA for me. Carly should be learning how to make her own meals, communicate with her own teachers, and learn how to self-soothe in times that she gets nightmares.

HELL even my mid 60s mother confides in her almost 80 yr old mother! Theres absolutely zilch wrong with this situation.", "I think you're jelaous of their relationship. At that age I remember going to my parents after a nightmare and I still do and I think that's ok.", "YTA. You\u2019re wife likely worked quite hard, and quite intentionally to create the type of relationship with her daughter to where even into her teenage years where most kids are anxious and reclusive with their parents, she feels safe coming to her mother with something probably vulnerable in the middle of the night- because she KNOWS she can count on her and that mom will always be there when she needs her. \n\nThat\u2019s the kind of thing that your wife will get SO much mileage out of when her kid is in her early adult years.  When it\u2019s the middle of the night and she went to a party she shouldn\u2019t have and now some guy is pressuring her to do something she doesn\u2019t want to - she\u2019s not going to think \u201cMom is gonna kill me\u201d she\u2019s gonna think \u201cI need to call my mom.\u201d \n\nI wish I\u2019d had a mom I could approach about that kind of stuff.  In reality if I\u2019d  known I could always rely on my parents- I\u2019d probably be a more secure adult. \n\nThese are the last few years your wife has to demonstrate that no matter what, she\u2019ll always be there for her. Let her do it. Support her, and demonstrate to her kids and your own that you ALSO will always be there when your kids are scared. \n\nI get being grumpy and sleep deprived. Being woken up when your exhausted is a quick adrenaline trip and it can be totally frustrating. But it\u2019s not because you\u2019re wife is a bad mom. You can express to her that you\u2019re tired and ask for grace with being grumpy because you didn\u2019t get enough sleep- but it\u2019s not cool to attack her for being a loving mother over it.  \n\nIf anything, take some inspiration from your wife and figure out how to create that bond with your kids so they also know that they can ALWAYS come to you.", "NAH. You have some valid concerns about Carly. She's 15, and some of the things your wife does for her (making lunch and talking to teachers about grades) Carly should be doing for herself. However, at the same time, you and your wife need to reassure Carly that you will be there for her, no matter when she needs help (even  nightmares in the middle of the night. I would also suggest family therapy. All 4 kids lost parents at young ages. There could be plenty of trauma that they are holding inside.", "What\u2019s wrong with mummy/mommy, I call my mom, mummy  I am 49 and my kids call me mummy , my youngest is 21", "Yep, YTA", "YTA. This kid likely has trauma from loosing a parent young. It\u2019s probably why she\u2019s clingy to her mom. No matter the ages of my kids, I\u2019m going to comfort them. Now if this was a regular occurrence I would certianly encourage therapy along with comfort from her mother.", "I don't get all the Y T A. I think NTA for many reasons. Maybe E S H because of this situation specifically....but it seems to be adding up.\n\n\n There's your relationship with your wife, of course, but there's also Carly needing to develop skills as an adult, and the feelings of the other boys. \n\n\nYou acknowledged that Carly needs comfort, but also that she needs to develop skills. Cassie needs to balance it.\n\n\nComing home to Carly sleeping in your bed? It'd be completely inappropriate for you to then climb into your own bed. Cassie can go into Carly's room. \n\n\n\"It's different because they are girls\". I'm sure the boys are hearing this too, and knowing they aren't getting the same support as Carly because \"she's a girl\". \n\n\nAs you said, Carly is 15. One instance of a nightmare, it's okay that she woke her mom up, but you are definitely right that she needs to develop other coping skills. Maybe through therapy. Does she want to go off to college?  Does she have the skills to do so independently? Being a supportive Mom isn't just hugs and cuddles, it's being able to teach independence and life skills. Mom can't call up college professors about grades, legally they can't give information, and it will reflect poorly on the student.", "Are you sure that she's overly dependent on her mom and it's not just a typical close mother-daughter relationship?\n\n It's hard to compare between a teenage girl and a teenage boy because their Need For Mom is often wildly different so I'd suggest getting that comparison mentality out of your head.", "Seeking comfort rather than sucking it up and suppressing negative emotions can be part of being a well adjusted adult.\n\nIf this doesn't become a routine, be glad that your teenage daughter still has such a close, trusting relationship with her mom.

These children lost parents at young ages and the boys seem to have been told to suck it up buttercup. Op you should have waited until you were not irritated to speak with your wife, plus it sounds like you let things build up until it all came tumbling out.  That is not a good way to communicate.  Your wife chose to go home to mom instead of dealing with the issues.  And your children are the ones to suffer.  They get irritated dad.\nBoys have emotional needs too.  Having a parent die at a young age can be devastating. They also need to know you or your wife are willing to provide a safe, nonjudgmental environment if they need to vent or breakdown.  Not to mention being in middle school is a special kind of hell in and of itself.  You couldn\u2019t pay me to go back to that age!\nPlease, please, get some therapy for everyone.", "All these  Y T A are delusion. At that her age it's so unhealthy for your step daugther to do that.

It\u2019s also very unfair to the three other kids that Carly gets immensely favored.", "Nta. Who is writing these comments? Clearly only people who can't function without sucking on their parents for the rest for their life. The independent people understand a teenager needs to sleep through the night on their own. Relying on your partner for a nightmare is one thing. Parents too, but after a certain age it instills permanent reliance and childlike tendencies if not nipped in the bud. So yes, she needs to stop coming into her mom and stepdad room at 4 am saying she has a nightmare like fucking 7 year old.

Carly needed comfort and as a parent it\u2019s your job to help them through these things. Wanting comfort after a nightmare isn\u2019t just a kid thing, it\u2019s very valid for Carly to want to seek some emotional support.\n\nHowever your wife is the AH for blatantly favouring Carly.

Are the boys aware of how much their mom favours Carly?\n\nIf so, you both need to talk.

These are things I\u2019ve worked hard to overcome, but they\u2019re always in the back of my mind. \n\nOur kids need to be able to take care of themselves, but we do them a disservice when we discourage them from relying on us at all. We all need help and comfort sometimes and the world would be a better place if we were more willing to ask for those things. \n\nThe only thing you mentioned that might need a second look is her relationship with the other kids.

And both of us work full time so yes, sometimes he is woken up and tired at work but he says that I\u2019m even more tired so it doesn\u2019t matter because he\u2019d rather support me than have me suffer alone.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not immature to seek comfort if upset and frankly too many teenagers hide their emotions and need for comfort from their parents because they are trying to be grown up, despite still sometimes badly needing a hug or a chat or to know they are still cared for even though they are growing. \n\n\nYour wife and daughter have a close bond. Carly communicates her feelings, emotions and issues to her mum. That\u2019s golden and will help if anything terrible happens in the future.

I\u2019m sorry you got woken up but that\u2019s not a reason for your wife to reject Carly if she comes to her upset. If you would prefer that Carly not sleep in your martial bed or that your bedroom be a place for just the two of you then talk to your wife over that, they can nap in another spot or have rules for coming into your room, that\u2019s reasonable, Carly can come get your wife and then your wife go back to her room to help her settle if she has nightmares and you can go back to sleep but don\u2019t ask her to straight out ignore Carly in the middle of the night if she is distressed.\n\n\nApologise to your wife.

She\u2019s taller than I am and cuddled in my lap and cried her eyes out. Parents give comfort when needed.", "Probably going to get down voted, but here goes.\n\nESH, except for the kids.\n\nFirst, it's perfectly fine for a child of any age to seek comfort from a parent. Since it seems you didn't actually talk to your stepdaughter about her nightmare, you have no idea what it was about. It could have very well been about the loss of her father, or perhaps losing another loved one. Maybe if you were a little more invested in your stepdaughter life/problems, you would understand. This also makes me wonder if your boys have the same issues, they just feel they can't come to you. That they're \"too old\" seek comfort from Dad. Pity.\n\nThe only reason your wife is TA here, too, is because she's not as involved in any of the boys' life, like she is her daughters. If she makes a lunch, and emails teachers about her daughter's grades, she should be doing the same for the boys. \n\nOr, just hear me out, you should both be more involved in the lives of your children to help support them as much as you can and guide them all into adulthood. This all should have been a discussion before you got married.", "YTA. I haven\u2019t read anything that seems a problem apart from your attitude towards it.

Instead of asking her to grow up, you should", "YTA. \n\nWell first up, a 15 year old is not a grown adult and even adults sometimes need comforting shoulders or a sounding board. If her best friend dies, would you get so pissy about Carly crying on her mother's shoulder? You seem like a real piece of work that does not really care about anything but your perception of the world. This is way it is with the rest of the kids, so this is how all kids should be type of guy. Well guess what a-hole, it is not. People are individuals and as individuals they have different needs and they mature at different rates.    \n\n\nDo you think that someone like Paul Simon had the same needs growing up as someone like Tom Brady? No they did not and you could not have molded either one into the others form without sever damage. Stop trying to mold her into the the same mold as the other kids. It will not work and all you will accomplish is making her miserable and you risking a divorce with your wife.   \n\n\nAs far as the name she calls her mother, it does not matter, Mother, Mommy, Mom, Mama, First name, nickname, it really does not matter.

By then she's had time to calm down, she's got something nice in her head again, and following her routine has made her sleepy again.\n\nAn important part of helping kids become independent is teaching them HOW and supporting them while they explore. Walk her through it for a while, then let her still come to you guys if her new routine isn't enough so you guys can come up with something else.\n\nNO TWO PEOPLE ARE THE SAME.

Personal opinion: it sounds like your wife and her daughter developed a codependent relationship to deal with the loss of Carly's bio dad. It may be comforting to Carly but your wife may also subconsciously be using this infantilizing behavior as a coping mechanism. If I'm wrong, great.

She definitely favors Carly over the boys but has assured me that it was just different since they were both girls.\n\nThis morning Carly woke me and my wife up at 4am saying she had a nightmare. The last time I was woken up by a nightmare was when Cole was 9 and Callum was 8. I was tryna sleep after a 12 hour shift and was a bit agitated, however I waited until Carly and Callum headed to school to speak with my wife. I told her that I understand that the kid needs comfort but she\u2019s also 15. In a few years she has to go off to college and won\u2019t have her mother to placate her whenever she needs it. She called me a douchebag for trying to deny her daughter comfort but I told her that Carly can\u2019t be a well adjusted adult if she relies on her mom constantly.

Maybe if you bring it up with them again try to explain that you're not just judging them, not just saying they're being weird or something, you're just saying you find it unreasonable to be woken up because a teenager had a bad dream.

So what she will be out of the house in a few years? All the more reason to give her the comfort she seeks NOW while she still can.

I\u2019ve seen a few of your comments under here and you are assuming that the wife is doing these things simply to spite the boys or because she doesn\u2019t care about them, you know absolutely nothing besides what is written here and a lot is left out very clearly. Why are you so determined to make the mom out to be this horribly neglectful person towards the boys?", "but she is a child she is not 18", "She was right that it's her child, she's not right about jumping to queue.", "I\u2019m English and I felt the same. When I heard it, to me it just came across as \u201cposh tw*t\u201d but if that\u2019s what he called her then whatever floats their boat .", "Urgh!  I was silly enough to ask my parents what it all meant and that's how I first heard about the birds and the bees.  I didn't understand a thing, but the part about the tampon pops up in my mind whenever I see Charles and then I ignore what he is saying to think \"eew.\"", "See it wouldn\u2019t even be that bad if it was just the first part, but then he had to come back with IN AND OUT, GET IT?! like a teenager who thinks they\u2019ve made their innuendo too subtle", "I would not presume that. I have raised children, mine and others, who needed more parental involvement with school for various reasons. Some temporarily, others long term. None of those reasons had anything to do with gender. I\u2019ve also had some want to take a lunch while others wanted school lunch. Also, not gender related. If he was truly concerned about all of this, why has it not been discussed before?", "We can't assume that it is indicative of a problem because we haven't got all ir even enough of the information", "Of course it's because she's a girl.  The wife admitted as much.", "I'm not assuming anything. OP said she does this for her daughter, but not her son. These are the facts we have to go on. If OP provides more facts, I will reassess my opinion. \n\nI don't think she's doing it to spite the boys, I'm honestly not sure where you're getting that from.", "Yes, I agree with that, and said as much in my earlier comment.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm wrong to say that saying \"well, she's still her mother's child\" is not a valid reason to call her a child.\n\nThe fact that she's a child is a valid reason to call her a child, but literally everybody on the planet is their mothers child. But that doesn't make them a child.", "That. I was just implying that sometimes parents assume to be more entitled respect others on some matters involving their children. (I don't know if you understand, English is not my first language)", "That was my thoughts as well, definitely more a posh thing no one from working class background would be calling their parents mummy and daddy at that age.", "Im not saying the mother is sexist for helping her daughter and not her son (though it is worth asking), I'm saying the fact that people are trying to dig for a reason that makes the fact that she helps her daughter and not the son okay is sexist, when in my experience this would not be the case if it were a man helping his son and not his daughter.", "Based on the amount of info provided, I'm fine thinking it's indicative of a problem. If/when OP provides more info, I will then reassess.", "I know what you said. You responded to my comment saying everyone would jump to that conclusion if genders were reversed. I explained to you why I would not.", "Well, you may not, but the Aita commenting audience overwhelmingly would, IMO.\n\nI also am taking this with a grain of salt, cause nobody would really admit to being sexist like that. Doesn't mean it wouldn't happen, though."]}
