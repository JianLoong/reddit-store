The time to reach out and be good parents to you has come and gone. You needed them to be attentive parents when you were a child and they couldn't be bothered, they can't just show up when you are an adult and expect to have an amazing relationship. They never put in the effort to build one.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to have a frank conversation with your parents. You appreciate the opportunities they afforded you, which have allowed you a chance to be where you are today, but they really dropped the ball on being present in your lives. You understand that they've had a scare and are reevaluating things, and you are open to spending more time with them, but they have to work around your schedules. You have your own families and commitments now and relationships with your in-laws. You aren't going to drop everything to give your parents a chance to make up for lost time. One thing that you absolutely will not tolerate from them is attempts at emotional manipulation. No one forced them to give you money or pay for things and you will not tolerate them saying that you owe them. You are their child, not an investment. If they try the manipulation (but we paid for, but your mom almost died, but you see x more) they will get a time out. The first time out is a week no contact. The next is two weeks. Then three weeks. If they have gone months or years without slipping you can decide if you want to set the clock back at zero, but I wouldn't share that with them. And then I'd suggest doing a couple of sessions of family therapy with them whether in person or on zoom. They need to hear how being absent hurt you and get from an impartial party that they need to earn a spot in your life after they list it by their behavior. Good luck.", "NTA, you don't owe your parents for raising you. That was their whole job when they had you. They should have been accommodating when you told them about the plans you had already made, instead of making demands that don't work for your schedule. You did attempt to reach back to your mom when you told her what would work for your schedule and a visit. It's on her that she threw that back at you, saying it wasn't good enough.", "NTA. Your parents aren't reaching out. They're making demands on their schedule like they have done their entire lives. If you want a relationship, then let them know that if they want a relationship, then they have to make an effort and plan things with you instead of insisting on what works for them. Any future relationship should be more on your terms until you feel comfortable and a more solid bond is formed.", "NTA\n\nMight want to revisit the idea of going NC.", "NTA. Just because they had a health scare they can't come sailing in from the left and demand that you give up all your plans and spend 10 days with them. As for them having spent a lot of money on you when you were kids, well boo-hoo!, that is the bare minimum. You are supposed to cover the cost of raising the children that you yourself chose to have. In your case they seem to have gotten away with considerably less than the minimum, since parents are also supposed to cover their own children's emotional needs while they are growing up, and your parents would seem to be severely lacking in that department.", "NTA \n\nAhh, the ol\u2019 \u201cso you won\u2019t die alone\u201d reasoning for having kids. \n\nThey never seem to understand that you also need to be good parents, or it doesn\u2019t matter if they have kids or not- they\u2019re going to die alone.", "NTA\n\nFelt a bit like I was reading the script of a lost episode of Absolutely Fabulous, tbh.  I hope you, your siblings, and your families have a really nice holiday season.", "They don't get to make demands after all this time.  If they want to reconnect they can do it in a respectful way, not the self centered way they're trying.  NTA.", "You get back what you put in when it comes to life, and the same goes for parenting and the relationships with your children. Sounds like your 'parents' are having trouble facing reality. I wouldn't bother explaining to your parents everything that's happened over the years, just state where the relationship is at and you don't feel comfortable pretending everything is normal and rosy, because it never was. End of discussion.", "NTA. A brush with death has obviously forced them to re-evaluate their priorities and maybe given them regrets that they want to address, but ten days over Xmas? Jesus wept.", "NTA- you don\u2019t owe your parents crap! They decided to have you and your siblings. They did the bare minimum and weren\u2019t there for you guys.", "NTA- when they were sick they realised their little unit of two can\u2019t look after the other. So they have decided you all need to step up. \n\nYou did the right thing. Tell them you\u2019ll help pay for additional support, but like there behaviour for the last x many years, your holidays are more important.", "NTA. This is the situation that their actions have created.", "\u201cMom, I really appreciate that you are trying to build a relationship with us. But with every new relationship , this one too should be taken in gradual steps as we get to know each other better. To spend 10 days day and night together when a relationship is this new seems like a recipe for disaster. Let\u2019s take it slow and see where it leads.\u201d", "NTA. Cat\u2019s in the Cradle by Harry Chapin is one song your mom needs to hear. \n She has finally realized how little she knows her children and their families. Some parents equate money invested with good parenting. \nThey sound like those type of parents. \nKeep your commitments and plans already scheduled.", "NTA your parents have zero interest in your families for your whole life and mom has a heart attack and now DEMANDS you spend not just Christmas with them but 10 days. Oh hell no! Don\u2019t change your plans on her demands.", "NTA you get what you worked for. No parent is entitled to your attention. You have your own family now and they should always be your focus.", "NTA they are thinking ahead to palliative care, selfishly of course. Don\u2019t alter your plans. Meet up with then if you have literally nothing else to do.", "NTA, they can come back \"around\", but that doesn't mean you have to accept it. They taught you that you weren't important to them. It's time for them to reap what they sow. Might I suggest NC if it escalates.", "Not gonna make a judgment, but they might be this desperate because they got a timelimit or the like and want to tell you in person", "NTA.\n\nI think most parents will never understand the concept of BEING a parent. That goes for any elder aunt or uncle too. It's not the childs responsibility to maintain a relationship between them and the parent. Parents act like douches and then 20 years later, wonder why their kids don't reach out anymore.", "NTA - they have been pretty neglectful emotionally, and it\u2019s not up to them to suddenly change everything.\n\nHowever I would say, if you can get them to be more realistic and respectful of your time - it\u2019s worth trying to mend that bridge as much as you can", "NTA. I\u2019d get a restraining order against them.", "[removed]", "YWBTA (if you cut your parents off and don't see them at all)\n\nSeems I will be in the minority here given some of the comments already, wherein people are so quick to jump towards telling you to completely cut your parents out of your life and go no contact with them, which is utterly insane in my opinion.\n\nI'm sorry that you feel that your parents weren't attentive enough when you and your brothers were younger, but, they are ostensibly making an effort now to try and reconnect with you guys.  You should at least give them that chance.  You certainly don't need to cancel your trip that you've already got planned to go and stay with your in-laws, but you and your brothers/your families should try to make arrangements to go and spend some time with your parents when it's suitable to do so.\n\nAgain, I may be in the minority here with this viewpoint, but one day - and possibly much sooner than you think - they will be dead and gone, and when that happens, there's no more opportunities to try and make things right.
