The time to reach out and be good parents to you has come and gone. You needed them to be attentive parents when you were a child and they couldn't be bothered, they can't just show up when you are an adult and expect to have an amazing relationship. They never put in the effort to build one.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to have a frank conversation with your parents. You appreciate the opportunities they afforded you, which have allowed you a chance to be where you are today, but they really dropped the ball on being present in your lives. You understand that they've had a scare and are reevaluating things, and you are open to spending more time with them, but they have to work around your schedules. You have your own families and commitments now and relationships with your in-laws. You aren't going to drop everything to give your parents a chance to make up for lost time. One thing that you absolutely will not tolerate from them is attempts at emotional manipulation. No one forced them to give you money or pay for things and you will not tolerate them saying that you owe them. You are their child, not an investment. If they try the manipulation (but we paid for, but your mom almost died, but you see x more) they will get a time out. The first time out is a week no contact. The next is two weeks. Then three weeks. If they have gone months or years without slipping you can decide if you want to set the clock back at zero, but I wouldn't share that with them. And then I'd suggest doing a couple of sessions of family therapy with them whether in person or on zoom. They need to hear how being absent hurt you and get from an impartial party that they need to earn a spot in your life after they list it by their behavior. Good luck.", "NTA, you don't owe your parents for raising you. That was their whole job when they had you. They should have been accommodating when you told them about the plans you had already made, instead of making demands that don't work for your schedule. You did attempt to reach back to your mom when you told her what would work for your schedule and a visit. It's on her that she threw that back at you, saying it wasn't good enough.", "NTA. Your parents aren't reaching out. They're making demands on their schedule like they have done their entire lives. If you want a relationship, then let them know that if they want a relationship, then they have to make an effort and plan things with you instead of insisting on what works for them. Any future relationship should be more on your terms until you feel comfortable and a more solid bond is formed.", "NTA\n\nMight want to revisit the idea of going NC.", "NTA. Just because they had a health scare they can't come sailing in from the left and demand that you give up all your plans and spend 10 days with them. As for them having spent a lot of money on you when you were kids, well boo-hoo!, that is the bare minimum. You are supposed to cover the cost of raising the children that you yourself chose to have. In your case they seem to have gotten away with considerably less than the minimum, since parents are also supposed to cover their own children's emotional needs while they are growing up, and your parents would seem to be severely lacking in that department.", "NTA \n\nAhh, the ol\u2019 \u201cso you won\u2019t die alone\u201d reasoning for having kids. \n\nThey never seem to understand that you also need to be good parents, or it doesn\u2019t matter if they have kids or not- they\u2019re going to die alone.", "NTA\n\nFelt a bit like I was reading the script of a lost episode of Absolutely Fabulous, tbh.

That goes for any elder aunt or uncle too. It's not the childs responsibility to maintain a relationship between them and the parent. Parents act like douches and then 20 years later, wonder why their kids don't reach out anymore.", "NTA - they have been pretty neglectful emotionally, and it\u2019s not up to them to suddenly change everything.\n\nHowever I would say, if you can get them to be more realistic and respectful of your time - it\u2019s worth trying to mend that bridge as much as you can", "NTA.

You should at least give them that chance.  You certainly don't need to cancel your trip that you've already got planned to go and stay with your in-laws, but you and your brothers/your families should try to make arrangements to go and spend some time with your parents when it's suitable to do so.\n\nAgain, I may be in the minority here with this viewpoint, but one day - and possibly much sooner than you think - they will be dead and gone, and when that happens, there's no more opportunities to try and make things right.

If they wanna complain about it, yeah, name the price. \n\nIt was harsh but they deserved nothing less.", "NTA \nYou do not owe your parents your time as they didnt give you any of theirs, they never made the effort to invite you for Christmas before so they have no right to demand it now\n\nI will say that they seem to be making an effort now, i agree with your decision to not cancel your plans but would you consider making plans to spend time with them afterwards?", "NTA. Your parents don't get to demand your time and appearances at their home on a whim, just because they've decided they actually want to interact with their family over the holidays for once.   \nEspecially not when you already have plans.   \nDouble especially not when they resort to guilt trips to try and manipulate you.", "You handled your mother fine. Your attitude with your wife, though\u2026\n\nYour last sentence sounds like a very all or nothing reaction. I\u2019m not sure what she meant exactly about \u201creaching back\u201d, but there is a lot of middle ground between \u201cHow much will it cost for you to leave me alone!\u201d and \u201cFine! I\u2019ll cancel on *your* parents, then!\u201d \n\nNTA", "NTA I went through the same thing with my Dad after he found out he had cancer, he went from rarely reaching out to wanting hour long phone calls every other day. Yes he provided for me and even got me a car but up until I was in my late twenties I didn't even think he liked me. It was jarring but extending him forgiveness when I was ready did bring me some peace. That's my story though, and this it yours. I don't think you are obligated to forgive a life time of emotional neglect.", "NTA\n\nThey had a huge wake up call.\n\nYou need time to adjust, hitting the snooze button.\n\nAfter my father died 6 years ago, my mom suddenly decided to make everything about family, mine.\n\nLots of issues in the past. Too much to detail. She had ruined all relationships with her family, my dad's family for years, it was painful for me to have no relationships with grandparents, aunts, uncles, & cousins. \n\nSuddenly everything I did, she felt slighted not being included. My best friends & their families were my family, suddenly she demanded to be included in everything, even though she called them \"my made up family\" that I threw in her face. It became so stressful.\n\nI'm all she has. My kids, (grown adults now) have a hard time dealing with her.\n\nI'm sad to say, I keep her at arms length for my own sanity. I'll do what I need to do.  Which is a lot.  But it's hard. I love her. But it's hard. \n\nWhatever you do, do it with boundaries.\n\n\nI get it, she lost her husband.", "Regret is hard to live with!!!  That goes for everyone,parents,grown children, grandparents, just everyone you see on the streets.  You can say your parents deserve what they get and they actually may but will you and your siblings regret your decision towards them later on down the road?  After the scare with your mom your parents regret their actions towards you kids and want to start making things right they just not going about it the best way.  Your whole family has a chance to heal a little because of your mom\u2019s heart attack but all of you need to try to take that chance together by controlling your bitterness at the past and look at this opportunity.", "NTA.\n\nEven offering to come afterwards is extending an olive branch.\n\nPeople treat you like crap until they face their mortality. Then they expect you to forgive everything, drop everything, and it's supposed to be all goodie. Life doesn't work that way.\n\nYou told them you would see them, but on your terms as you already have plans. That's quite fair.", "NTA. There was a song a long time ago called \"Cats In the Cradle\". Your parents should have listened to that song. They were the adults in the room for a very long time and chose to not spend time with their children and their families. Your parents are lucky you're willing to see them at all.", "NTA. You can tell them the same thing we told our grandma after grandpa died: I'm glad that your priorities have changed and now you want us in your life, but we cannot do it on your schedule.", "NTA - they probably want home care and someone to cater to them.  Maybe they had a financial set back,  write them a check and be done with them.", "NTA. Just because they\u2019re finally coming around doesn\u2019t mean you have to run and answer the door for them. If that time has come and gone for you that is absolutely ok. It\u2019s not your fault that they never showed you love and care that a parent should show. You didn\u2019t choose for them to be absent they did.", "NTA, it's sad that they needed such a rude awakening to realize that they were lousy parents but that's their cross to bear and it's up to them to make amends, not you, they should have accepted that you already have plans and that either they join you or wait.", "NTA. Thing is, they still don't care about you, they're just using you to make themselves feel better because your mom had to face her own mortality. They're now trying to play happy families because she wants to feel better about herself, but they still aren't demonstrating any care for your feelings", "NTA they can\u2019t just force themselves back into your life because they had a health scare", "Two weeks before Christmas they want all of you to drop what you're doing and spend 10 days with them on their turf and refused an invitation to join your scheduled plans?!! They are ridiculous. You are not the A. Your wife is wrong but she probably thinks your parents aren't so different than hers.", "Thats what you should have told her- okay we can go and cancel our trip- lets see how that would have worked.....", "In German we call what your parents did \u201cWohlstandsverwahrlosung\u201d - wealthy neglect. They provided for all your material needs, but neglected you emotionally, which is terrible and perfidious. I\u2019m so glad you still built a family and managed to forge those familial bonds. Your parents are reaping what they sowed. Pretty audacious of them to just demand your time and effort after not giving two sh*ts for so long. NTA and I really wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to spend more time with them. THEY can make the effort!", "NTA. Your parents did not make having a relationship with you a priority for most of your life and now expect you to drop everything to have a relationship with them. The comments they made about money were inconsiderate and inappropriate. You are still willing to work on things, but on your terms. I honestly think that is fair considering their lackluster parenting. They did what looks good on paper, but didn't put the feeling into it.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is wrong. They aren't coming around because they've realised they did something wrong. They're holding everything over your heads to try to bully you into doing what they want. They don't feel bad for how they emotionally neglected you. It just suits them to make demands of you now.\n\nThat is not the same thing as realising the depths of their own callousness and wanting to make amends. And even if that were the reason for their change of heart, you still wouldn't owe them anything. It is never the children's responsibility to make up for their parents failings. Never.", "NTA. It\u2019s too bad it took something serious like a medical emergency to bring some sense to your folks. You owe them nothing.", "NTA.  They are reaching out and wanting a relationship but they want it entirely on their own terms.  They're are still just as self-centered as they've always been.  If they truly want to spend time with you then they'll make it happen on YOUR timeframe and not theirs.  No way would I give in to their demands.  Your education doesn't give them a lifetime pass to dictate how you spend your holidays, etc.", "NTA, you don't have to accept it if they do come back \"around.\" You were taught that you held no significance to them. Now is the moment for them to get what they sowed. Should it get worse, would I recommend NC?", "But op can still allow the parents to invest time and effort into them when it's convenient for him and his wife? They don't owe their parents anything but if they for example come by and cook for them or something else that's not a hassle at all they could as well allow the parents to work for it.\n\nChange holiday = major hassle. Free food and hospitality = net positive. If it's not a net positive the parents can put in more effort. They either want it badly enough or they don't.\n\nThey're clearly self-absorbed though and it needs to be clear that that doesn't work anymore", "This should be top comment. I hope u/Short-Necessary-2855 sees this. NTA, OP.", "Harry Chapin's \"Cat's in the Cradle\" seems to fit this post pretty well", "i like this answer", "I somewhat agree but find the time out stuff a bit immature. Having healthy boundaries doesn\u2019t have to involve drama.", "I kind of agree but will note that there is a huge range of \u2018raising\u2019. You don\u2019t owe parents for fulfilling their basic responsibilities but if they went above and beyond that (as many parents do) then you should absolutely be appreciative. You are owed the basics, but the frills are a big gift.", "This is it. They want a relationship at their convenience.  Yes, they spent money on you and your brother when you were growing up. That's what you do when you decide to have children. Go enjoy your holiday plans with your family.", "That is one of the saddest songs I\u2019ve ever heard.", "They already agreed to see them though just after the holidays?\n\nMaybe read and then judge?", "One of the things that I picked up on was that the parents wanted OP and his siblings to come *to them*. They would still have to potentially wrangle kids and do all the stuff you do when you take your kids to someone else\u2019s house. It\u2019s *still* OP putting in the work.", "The time out method is a common therapy tool for dealing with someone whom you are unwilling or unable to cut out of your life but who is having trouble respecting boundaries. Sometimes it's suggested as a standard we take a week time out (or a day or a month, the time depends on the circumstances) sometimes it's utilized with increasing increments similar to repeat offenders in many criminal justice systems. As long as the boundaries and the consequences for violating the boundaries (the time out) are clearly expressed before hand this is literally the most mature way you can handle this kind of conflict. If you just dropped off the face of the earth with no warning and no explanation in the style of I'm mad and giving you the silent treatment ala kids that would be immature. This is different.", "Nobody owes their patents for raising them. They don't owe their parents anything for what they chose to give their children. If they wanted to be paid back they could have made a contract stating so, contract for tuition, contract for wedding money, contact for a car, contract for etc. They can't demand money or time to repay gifts freely given in the past.", "I didn\u2019t say you have to cut them a check, I said that parents going above and beyond for their kids is worthy of appreciation."]}
