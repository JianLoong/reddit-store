And it\u2019s not \u201cjust a necklace\u201d and they know that. What do they think happened? That the necklace magically jumped in the air and broke itself? Why where the twins in your room anyway?", "Absolutely NTA. It is 100000% valid to be upset that the final gift left to you by your father before he passed was broken. Obviously the kids broke it, but they\u2019re also only 5, so it\u2019s entirely on the parents for not ensuring their children weren\u2019t messing with your stuff.

They will ask again so be prepared to answer in a calm manner and in detail to the events you witnessed. It will be a challenge and you should not have to take on this responsibility.

Because if you weren't there, the twins would be destroying your stuff and their parents won't stop them!", "Thank you, the necklace definitely means a lot it has been so difficult not having my dad around the last 2 months \n\nI think the reason my mom and stepdad think I lied is that they automatically always take the twins' word no matter what", "I might be able to but it'll be difficult because unless my mom let them have custody she automatically has rights because she's my mom and is seen as a fit person to live within the court's eyes", "Thank you, I might ask my grandma to keep some of my stuff with her because I doubt they'll let me have a door with a lock on it", "I mean that's possible the main reason I think it's the twins is because they were in my room and arguing about something before I came in I forgot to add this but they were also standing near my nightstand where I put my necklace while I took my shower", "NTA.  Given the lack of parental discipline, that you are not the golden child and the twins are, the items associated with your father are precious, and the inability to replace, you need to consider securing that of value to you.  Either on-site with a safe or in a dedicated, well-labeled safe at your paternal grandmas (so there is no confusion on ownership in case grandma passed away).", "Definitely speak to your grandmother about leaving sentimental items at her place. \n\nAt 16, you have a say in your living arrangements. In the meantime, try to establish boundaries with your mother that include the twins not coming in your room.  \nFind an adult - maybe a counselor- that you can speak to about all this.  You\u2019ve experienced a profound loss.  Hugs! \n\nNTA!", "NTA at all. Your mom and stepdad are at fault here for teaching their 5 year olds it's ok to break other people's things and lie. Your sisters should absolutely have been made to apologize but at this point, the people you should be mad at are their parents, not them. And I know it doesn't make the situation any better, but your sisters have likely noticed you always wear the necklace and are curious about YOU and that's why they gravitated towards the necklace. They want the thing you are closest with to be close to you or to be like you. It would be more flattering if they hadn't accessed it without permission and broke it. Hope you can get it fixed.", "NTA.This is disturbing on more than one level.", "NTA. I'm sorry your father passed away, and I'm sorry you have such an awful mother and step-father. \n\nWould living with your grandmother be a possibility?", "No no no ABSOLUTELY NOT. You\u2019re not TA! Your dad who passed only a couple months ago bought you that for your birthday. That\u2019s not just \u201csome necklace \u201c and for them to say that to you while you\u2019re grieving is sooooo upsetting to me. How dare they. That is a very important necklace and they should absolutely apologize and pay to fix it.", "Which is why they lie because they know they aren't going to be doubted. So it doesn't matter if they're caught red-handed they can just say nuhuh and get away with it.\n\nYou might want to consider if there is a another family member you could live with. Sadly.", "You\u2019re 16. Most courts would take your views into consideration.", "No locked door?\n\nTry to get out of there.  Look into moving in with your grandparents.", "NTA\n\nThey broke the necklace, I have no doubt about that.\n\nIt speaks volumes that you weren't living with your mom after the divorce... or even 50:50.  You were never your mom's priority.  Neither your mom or your step dad are happy you are living there.\n\nI would do what you can to live with other family members ie start by speaking to your grandmother.  At 16 you probably have more legal rights to decide where to live.\n\nOut of curiosity... because of your dad's death.. you should be receiving survivor benefits from the government on behalf of your dad till you are 18.  Who's getting that? Is it your mother on your behalf but no one has told you that?  I bet the reason you are allowed to live at your mothers is that she is getting money for that that's supposed to be going to you (or to fund your costs) but you likely aren't seeing a cent.\n\nSpeak to the counsellor at school and your grandparents/other family members about what you can do to legally emancipate yourself from your mother and choose where you live if she won't let you live elsewhere.\n\nYou have a very good argument for not living with her seeing as you didn't live with her before your dad passed and likely have a closer relationship to other relatives.", "NTA, please find a safe place to keep any and everything that you still have of your dad's, maybe grandma's house?  It will not be long until they destroy everything that means anything to you.", "Sorry for your loss and that you have to deal with inconsiderate people. I hope your necklace can be repaired.

Ask you mom and step dad to put a hook and eye latch on the outside of your door (high up on door) so you can lock it when your not in there, the kids can\u2019t reach the lock but parents can get into your room if they have to.  Keep the things you don\u2019t want ruined up high or hidden in a draw where the kids don\u2019t get at it. You\u2019re 16 and have start thinking adultly now.  Foresight.

Or don't you have any grandparents you can live with? You're 16, you're free to choose who you want to live with.\n\nSorry for your loss. Hope the necklace can be repaired, since your relationship with your mother and stepdad can't be.", "NTA\n\nAnd WTF is wrong with your mother?\n\nKeep everything valuable and sentimental at a trusted relatives house (maybe grandmas) and spend as much time there as possible. Maybe even see if you can move in.", "Can you possibly go live with your father's mother or some other relatives?  You're in a no-in situation with your mum and this awful stepdad.  Of course they know it was their precious daughters who broke the necklace.  You are being disrespected.  Still you are 16 so you've only got a few more years before you can be independent of these people. \n\nOne thing you definitely need to sort out is whether or not your father mentioned you specifically in any will he left behind. It is quite possible you have been left a part of his estate. If you don't know about it, it's time you find out. Talk to his mother. Tell her what's going on if she's still around (I hope she is!). Otherwise consult a lawyer and if you can't afford one, which is likely because you're 16, try and see a local citizens advice bureau or other organisation that might be able to look into this for you.\n\nI wish you luck.", "If they broke one thing, they will break others. Anything you don't want broken, give to your grandma for safe keeping. And let her know about the situation. Do the same for important papers and documents.\n\nIf you tell your mom about it (hopefully afterwards), might want to have grandma on hand for that too.", "Wow. So you're a teen, just lost your dad, and instead of giving you all the love and support you need, they're rubbing on your face their favoritism toward the other daughters.\nNot to mention they're 5, what else the parents were expecting them to say? \"Yes, our fault, ground us\" ???\n\nNTA and agree with the others, you or at least your belongings need and deserve a better place and honestly you already sound conditioned to their behavior being kind of normal/expectable and this is urgh itself", "NTA\nI have a five year old and he\u2019s old enough to know not to break things and not to lie.

Can you live with your grandma?", "NTA at 16 can you move in with grandma?", "They need to keep the twins out of your room.get a lock. NTA", "Can you fix it? NTA Ask your grandma to help you.", "So do your parents think in between to be malicious what is their idea of what happened it didn\u2019t break spontaneously. And do the twins deny that They were in your room and arguing about it? I think you should talk to the twins with some questioning im sure you can easily get them to admit the truth,  they are five.", "Thay are 5 years old. They will do anything to avoid being punished. The parents should be aware of this,  and the OP should definitely lock up things that are valuable.", "So the twins were in your room, alone with the necklace. And the last time you saw it was before they were alone with it? \n\nSeems pretty cut and dry. And your mom and step dad don't think 5 years will lie to avoid getting in trouble? \n\nIf is not such a big deal, then they can have the girls apolagize, and get the necklace fixed. Until then, why should you bother talking to them?\n\nNTA.", "I would ask your mum and stepdad:\nWell there are only four other people in this house. I assumed that the twins broke my recently deceased father\u2019s last special gift to me, because they were in my room without permission and arguing when I found the broken necklace on the ground. The only way I could be wrong is if in the few minutes I was in the shower one of you two broke it and would rather have me think that the twins did it.\nSo if you\u2019re saying that the twins are innocent, which one of you two broke it and are refusing to fess up?\n\n\u2026or did the twins do this and a simple \u2018that was wrong, you need to say sorry and never go into OP\u2019s room without permission otherwise you could break other valuable things that mean a lot to her\u2019\nand you would have been upset, but moved on?\nInstead they are teaching the twins to be brats who can lie to get their way and it\u2019ll work!\n\nI\u2019m so sorry about your dad and I hope your mum can get her head out of your stepdad\u2019s ass and you guys work it out, but if not and you have the opportunity to live elsewhere, do it and don\u2019t feel guilty or at fault in any way - the people who should take care of you should do exactly that, and if not, they failed coz they were shitty, selfish parents/people and their own deficiencies, not your own (I know you know that, but sometimes it\u2019s hard for our subconscious to let us fully believe that).", "Nta, that\u2019s heartbreaking op!
