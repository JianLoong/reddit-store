How about he \"volunteers\" you a break once a week?) and now he's just projecting onto you cos deep down he knows he's an ass.\n\nIt's a safety hazard for your husband and his whole family to watch the kids for a few hours, but you doing it alone for days on end is completely safe?

Mother's Day was about me, and generally about being a person, a mother. Surely, someone else could \"celebrate\" and change a nappy for me?\n\nThe notion that someone goes, \"yeah, it is Mother's Day, let's change more nappies/manage more behaviours etc etc\" is just daft. It's like having an RDO and saying, \"yeah, let's go to work.\"\n\nMother's Day now that the kids have moved out are much better.\n\nYour post makes it sound like he (your partner) doesn't know how to manage your kids. ASD can be hard work, but he needs to stop being scared if that is the case.\n\nSo yes, remember Mother's Day is different for everyone. Some may want to spend more time with their kids, some may want time-out and focus on themselves, some are happy to share the limelight.

Here is the thing I absolutely do not want to go and have asked my husband if I can skip and he bring the kids.\n\nMy reasoning makes sense to me, but my husband says I am being selfish and it\u2019s his mom\u2019s mother\u2019s day too and I need to come. Now for my reasons. \n\n1. I\u2019m a SAHM and take care of my kids mostly alone almost all the time. They are 2 and 4, both have ASD. My oldest goes to a special needs preschool for 2.5 hours a day, but other than that and taking them to appointments I\u2019m alone with the kids from 7-7 for 5 days a week. My husband helps on the weekends, but he volunteers and some Saturdays is gone half the day.\n\n2. I told my husband in advance whatever we do for mother\u2019s day I really don\u2019t want to chase the kids around. I really just wanted to order something in and relax for once.\n\n3. My husband initially said his siblings will help (they never do and I don\u2019t expect them too), so I wont have to chase the kids. That was when I suggested him taking them alone, so I can go get a massage or something. He then back tracked and said he can\u2019t bring them alone to a lake for safety reasons. He also said how sad it is I would chose to not be with my children on mother\u2019s day.\n\nThis whole series of events just feels manipulative to me. AITA here? I need some outside opinions, so I can decide if I should stand my ground or just give in.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I told my husband I want nothing to do with his family or mine\u2026 it\u2019s my day & nobody else\u2019s! I\u2019ll call both our moms and my sister & that\u2019s it.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t always like this. Every year, we used to get together for this huge Mother\u2019s Day BBQ & most often my husband would host it. When that was the case, I\u2019d agree to the BBQ but would take Saturday as my own Mother\u2019s Day\u2026 basically swap the days to make everybody happy.\n\nThen COVID hit, and we had to spend our first Mother\u2019s Day as separate families. After restrictions lifted, I told him he needed to suck it up & tell his fam that I just want to CHILL on what\u2019s supposed to be a relaxing day for me, and honestly, everyone on both sides supported that decision 10000%. Here, his sister (same age) had told my MIL the same thing! Now we all do individual things that day.", "That guy is an ah and an all around jerk. \n\nHes not interested in giving her a break at all. \n\nIf he was, he wouldnt be so insitent and demand that she come. He would have no problem taking the kids by himself so that his wife could have a break, or letting her go to the salon. \n\nHe wantsbher to go so that can drink and relax while his mom gets to see the kids but the wife has to run after them. \n\nHe told her that its his moms mothers day too. Its not, grandma's are not the priority any longer on mothers day. \n\nYour really reaching reaching trying to give this guy the benefit benefit of dodoubt. He doesnt care about his wife at all. \n\nShe's basically a single mothrr and hes just the fun dad who swoops in to play when he wants to. \n\nThe dads not interested in doing anything for his wife on mother's day, he couldn't care less. He thinks she should she should with the kids so he doesnt have to and a picnic celebrating someone else should be enough. \n\nDude a major ah."]}
