From what you've said it sounds like your husband avoids his responsibility to his own kids at every chance he gets (volunteering? How about he \"volunteers\" you a break once a week?) and now he's just projecting onto you cos deep down he knows he's an ass.\n\nIt's a safety hazard for your husband and his whole family to watch the kids for a few hours, but you doing it alone for days on end is completely safe? What a bloody muppet, tell him to eat sand.", "Nta. Book a spa trip for yourself for Father's day weekend. After all, what kind of a father wouldn't want to spend Father's day with his kids?", "You're a Mother. Why can't you celebrate Mother's day by having some \"me\" time?\n\nOn another note... why are some grandmothers so hellbent in overriding the next generation mothers, especially DILs? Why must the kids celebrate grandma on Mother's day and do nothing for Mom?\n\nOP, you're not choosing to \"not be with your children\". You requested some time off, some respite, but your husband wants to make this Mother's day about *his* mother and not you. And I have a feeling it's not the first time that this happens.\n\nNTA", "When the next generation have children, it's THEIR turn for mother's day, and Grandmas need to step back. \n\nI always ask my husband this when he tries to do a \"lets celebrate Mother's Day with MIL\" thing: *How often did you celebrate Mother's Day with your grandma, and not your mom, when you were growing up?*\n\nCrickets.", "NTA. YOU have young children and it is YOUR day too! Stay home alone and DO NOT GIVE IN. When my kids were young I also had to beg my now EX-husband to do something with them for even two hours. EX being the operative prefix.   \nYou deserve a break, and if not on Mother's Day, when?", "NTA. You are a mother also and deserve a special day, not just to be a guest to your MIL. But I\u2019m getting a different read: I think your husband just doesn\u2019t want to take care of the kids. He\u2019s so used to foisting them off on you that he doesn\u2019t know what to do with them without you (or just doesn\u2019t want to because watching them would cut into his beer drinking time with him and the boys).\n\nAlso, you are an adult. You don\u2019t *need* your husband\u2019s permission to stay at home. You can simply choose to and tell him what you are doing. After all, it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day, and you are a mother.", "NTA. It's always okay to avoid one's MIL.\n\nYour husband's behavior is very disappointing if he won't even look after the kids for one day. (On Mother's Day, of all days. The day on which you should be getting a break.)", "NTA \n\nIt's your mother's day too. Your feelings should also be considered. Your husband claiming it's unsafe for him to go by himself sounds like a cop out.

But hubby and kids will be there while I recharge.\u201d If she\u2019s a reasonable person, she\u2019d understand and perhaps get other family members to help your husband out. She\u2019s expecting to spend the day with her grandkids so, hubby won\u2019t leave then with you and go by himself. He\u2019d be a super jerk and his family would wonder where the heck the kids are.

It should be your choice, and your choice is for him to take the kids for the day and you be left alone.", "NTA\n\nNotice how he didn't volunteer to be responsible for his own children but volunteered aunts and uncles.  Nope.   And you need to sit down with him and talk about getting time for your own self care.  If he has time to volunteer the weekend then there is time for you to get out of the house", "NTA for not wanting to go, but if I were you I would agree on the condition that it\u2019s still your day off. He can be in charge of packing the kids up, looking after them at the park, and going home. If he complains make a joke in front of everyone that it\u2019s your day and he agreed that he was man enough to handle it. You\u2019ll make him see what you deal with every day and if he doesn\u2019t pull it together he\u2019ll look weak in front of his whole family. And then book a massage on Father\u2019s Day.\n\nBut that\u2019s mostly a joke and wouldn\u2019t contribute to a healthy marriage.

If I come to the picnic, then I\u2019ll feel responsible. It\u2019s really hard to have two toddlers (let alone neuro diverse ones) at a lakeside picnic, and I know you said your siblings would help, but next breath you said you can\u2019t take them alone I presume because those same siblings\u2026. Won\u2019t help. Work with me here\u2026 I want to spend some time with the kids, but I also want to be utterly alone, not hearing anyone or anything, for some of the day too.\u201d", "NTA: He doesn't want to take them alone because he knows he'll be the one chasing after them.\n\nTell your MIL for Mother's Day you're getting a day of rest. She should understand. Hope you get to enjoy your day.", "I think you have answered your own question with point 3.\n\nMother's Day means different things for different people.\n\nSomeone else posted \"a very wise older woman told me once that 'you start wanting to spend   \nMother's Day with your children around the same time they become independent of you\".\n\nI think this is so true (Disclaimer: personal opinion) - I didn't want to spend more time with kids that I was already spending 90% of my time with, and then had to then change the nappy of. Mother's Day was about me, and generally about being a person, a mother. Surely, someone else could \"celebrate\" and change a nappy for me?\n\nThe notion that someone goes, \"yeah, it is Mother's Day, let's change more nappies/manage more behaviours etc etc\" is just daft. It's like having an RDO and saying, \"yeah, let's go to work.\"\n\nMother's Day now that the kids have moved out are much better.\n\nYour post makes it sound like he (your partner) doesn't know how to manage your kids. ASD can be hard work, but he needs to stop being scared if that is the case.\n\nSo yes, remember Mother's Day is different for everyone. Some may want to spend more time with their kids, some may want time-out and focus on themselves, some are happy to share the limelight. Work out works for you, and what you need.\n\nAnyway - good luck. And Happy Mother's Day - whatever you decide to do.", ">My husband helps on the weekends, but he volunteers and some Saturdays is gone half the day.\n\nNo. You have two kids with ASD. He needs to be home. You should skip the picnic. He can go and take your kids. He just doesn't want to. I like picnics. Wouldn't want to do one by a lake with very small children. NTA.", "[deleted]", "NTA, but you can maybe compromise.  \n\n\nIt's totally understandable that a mother like you might need a day off, a day to relax and maybe be pampered.\n\nIt's also understandable that your MIL wants to get everyone together for a nice day.\n\nHowever, since that \"nice day\" will actually be a lot of work for you, perhaps you and your family can just stop by for a short time, like 1-2 hours ONLY. And then the rest of the day, you get to relax. It doesn't have to be one thing or the other.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
