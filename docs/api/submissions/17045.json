Mother's Day was about me, and generally about being a person, a mother. Surely, someone else could \"celebrate\" and change a nappy for me?\n\nThe notion that someone goes, \"yeah, it is Mother's Day, let's change more nappies/manage more behaviours etc etc\" is just daft. It's like having an RDO and saying, \"yeah, let's go to work.\"\n\nMother's Day now that the kids have moved out are much better.\n\nYour post makes it sound like he (your partner) doesn't know how to manage your kids. ASD can be hard work, but he needs to stop being scared if that is the case.\n\nSo yes, remember Mother's Day is different for everyone. Some may want to spend more time with their kids, some may want time-out and focus on themselves, some are happy to share the limelight. Work out works for you, and what you need.\n\nAnyway - good luck.
