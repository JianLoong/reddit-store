J didn't specify that you had to buy 2 gifts.\n2. Buying a gift for a kid who isn't having a party is really dumb\n3.

Additionally, these are not your children; if the parents want to do this weird tradition, THEY can buy gifts for both kids but you, an unrelated party, have no obligation to buy something for a child at random.

Fourteen is old enough to understand that you don't get a gift on another child's birthday.  Your friend is strange for insisting on this.  Plus, if you're a new friend, it's a bit much for them not to be grateful you got any gift at all.  You barely know this child.", "NTA. J has a ridiculous sense of fairness. I can't believe they indulge a 14 year old that way. These kids are going to go out into the real world, sooner than later, and realize that nobody celebrates two birthdays for themselves at once. Both kids are going to grow up with resentment that they never had a special day just for themselves. Look on the bright side. You saved yourself the cost of two gifts per year with this rather twisted person.", "NTA.\n\nI agree with you.  It's easy enough to teach kids that it's another kid's birthday and they have to wait for their own to get a present.", "NTA, and J is not doing her kids any favors with this silly birthday present tradition.  You are not wrong and J is raising two entitled brats.  You would do well to absent yourself from this relationship.", "I.did this with my Kids until they where around 7.

Presents are for the kid who\u2019s having the birthday. Not for the other kid. The other kid needs to learn that they\u2019ll get theirs when it\u2019s their birthday.

Why would you take a gift to the other one as well?", "NTA and those poor kids for being raised to expect that someone can\u2019t have a special day on their own without the other getting something.

And by young, I mean 6 or younger, the idea sorta being that young kids don't always understand that today is about person A and not them- particularly when that person is their sibling.\n\nBut by small present, I mean small- it was generally $5 or less. And given to the sibling early in the party- not at sibling's present opening time. Cuz ultimate the party was still about sibling's birthday.\n\nA 14 year old shouldn't need that kind of treatment. Heck, at 8 yr old shouldn't need it. That's mom and dad just sorta failing. But if they want to do this- they can.

The expectation or demand is next level.", "Nope, I have a 6 and 3 yo.  They get presents on their birthdays, and they know it\u2019s for them, and not the other. They also know, if it\u2019s the person\u2019s birthday, the birthday person gets blow the candles, gets the presents AND get the first slice of cake.\n\nIt blows my mind that people need to get a present just because it\u2019s a sibling\u2019s birthday (obviously if they share a birthday it\u2019s a different story)."]}
