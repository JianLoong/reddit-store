My parents used to bring an \u201cunbirthday present\u201d for siblings of grandchildren, but that was when they were younger and nobody asked in the first place. A 14 year old can freaking grasp that not every day is their special day.", "NTA - that's bizarre, entitled, and grasping as hell.", "NTA.\n\n Because:\n1. J didn't specify that you had to buy 2 gifts.\n2. Buying a gift for a kid who isn't having a party is really dumb\n3. J is acting really entitled to what you spend your money on. \n\nAnd I think the teenager has the mental capacity to understand that it's not their day therefore there won't be and presents for them.", "NTA It was K's birthday and you bought a gift for K. You are not obligated to buy for every child in the household so they don't feel left out.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think expecting a gift for every child is reasonable at all", "NTA. What the holy hell is wrong with those people? Please donate K\u2019s gift to a shelter or library.", "NTA. Maybe if these kids were 3 and 5, okay. But 8 and 14? Come on.", "NTA at all. It was generous to get a new friends child a gift in the first place.", "NTA for doing the very normal thing. I\u2019m curious how far this making sure no one feels left out goes. Sounds like a terrible precedent. She\u2019s setting them up for massive disappointment.", "NTA.  This isn't a 'kids birthday' problem, it's a 'J has rules that you have to *just know* via telepathy and will respond with a complete lack of self control if you break them' problem, so honestly, I think J might be quite a tiring person.", "Is there a 10 foot pole around here somewhere?\n\nNTA", "NTA. That\u2019s a crazy assed rule. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing\u2026if J wants to do this with their kids, that\u2019s on J. So j should have a stash of gifts to give T if that\u2019s the plan\u2026not expect others to do that. And certainly not call you a selfish AH for not doing it. That\u2019s a super extreme and nasty reaction. \n\nI would *slightly* understand this more if T was 1-2. Not really understand it, understand it\u2026. because it\u2019s crazy, but it would slightly be less unbelievable. But T is 14? That\u2019s nucking futz\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nA lot of parents might get the other kid a (typically small) present just to make them not feel left out, but I have never heard of a case where they expect anyone else to do so. That is frankly a ridiculous request for them to make of you.", "NTA. So, the kid\u2019s birthdays aren\u2019t days to celebrate their individuality. I think that\u2019s sad.", "Nta.  What in the actual fuk \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. \n\nIf T was a toddler or a kid that wouldn\u2019t understand that birthday gifts are only for the person celebrating the birthday then a tiny gift to keep them satisfied would make sense but not expected.

NTA OP.", "NTA-   \n\n\nThis can't be real can it?", "That\u2019s just rude, entitled and ridiculous. NTA times a million. You know what you should do? Send your \u201cfriend\u201d this thread and tell her \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t get your teenager anything but to make up for it, here\u2019s a present for you!

And if she expected it, she should have said so before the party. \n\nMy parents did this sort of as my birthday and my sister's were close together (mine first). We'd each get one present on the other's birthday ands the birthday girl got all the rest. Usually, it was something we were going to play together or something we'd fight over if one had and the other didn't. (So like we'd each get a Barbie but not the same, or both get a Play-do set of our own. ). But never was is expected or required from other people to do the same, even our grandparents.", "NTA What a weird way to grab more gifts of the guests...  To also ask you to get money, wow. A birthday is something just for the birthday person, that they also need to share that with their sibling. Does they also have two cakes?

Good for you you didnt cave into catering to some entitled people.", "NTA\n\n\nIf J's intent on raising entitled, spoilt brats, J should at least be the one to foot the bill", "NTA; getting a child who is old enough to understand the concept of birthdays and dates a present on their siblings birthday is honestly just entitled. Additionally, these are not your children; if the parents want to do this weird tradition, THEY can buy gifts for both kids but you, an unrelated party, have no obligation to buy something for a child at random. I feel like this is only going to set the parents up for failure when their children are both spoiled and can\u2019t take no for an answer as teenagers.", "NTA return K's gift and forget J exists, she's clearly acting entitled and spoiling her children", "NTA - Not sure how to even respond to this! We taught our kids that their birthday was coming soon and that they would get presents of their own! If our other child got something on their siblings birthday it is because the person would not be able to make the other party, and we always put the present aside for them to open on their birthday! (Unless the person who gifted it wanted them to open it right then)", "NTA the is so wrong on so many levels.  Poor kids can't have at least one special day for themselves.", "NTA.  Fourteen is old enough to understand that you don't get a gift on another child's birthday.  Your friend is strange for insisting on this.  Plus, if you're a new friend, it's a bit much for them not to be grateful you got any gift at all.  You barely know this child.", "NTA. J has a ridiculous sense of fairness. I can't believe they indulge a 14 year old that way. These kids are going to go out into the real world, sooner than later, and realize that nobody celebrates two birthdays for themselves at once. Both kids are going to grow up with resentment that they never had a special day just for themselves. Look on the bright side. You saved yourself the cost of two gifts per year with this rather twisted person.", "NTA.\n\nI agree with you.  It's easy enough to teach kids that it's another kid's birthday and they have to wait for their own to get a present.", "NTA, and J is not doing her kids any favors with this silly birthday present tradition.  You are not wrong and J is raising two entitled brats.  You would do well to absent yourself from this relationship.", "I.did this with my Kids until they where around 7. Then I talked to the Kids and we stopped ...I never expected anyone Else to do it. Thats Just wreid", "NTA  ... What a way to contribute to a sense of entitlement in your children.... just wow....", "NTA and I wouldn't be friends with J anymore. That's inappropriate and boundary crushing.", "NTA. Presents are for the kid who\u2019s having the birthday. Not for the other kid. The other kid needs to learn that they\u2019ll get theirs when it\u2019s their birthday. And the family asking you for cash? That\u2019s pretty outrageous.", " NTA \n\nA 14 year old can realize it\u2019s not her birthday and should be cognizant enough to realize that you don\u2019t get presents on others birthdays. \n\nDoes she bring presents to others parties for her kids to open there too?", ">Maybe if these kids were 3 and 5, okay.\n\nEven if the kids were 3 and 5, demanding a present for the kid whose birthday it's not, and insisting a guest goes to the cash machine to withdraw money to make up for the lack of gift would still not be okay.", "That's how you wind up with spoiled kids."]}
