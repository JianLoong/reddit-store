(It especially sucks when you're expected to be mature enough to not care about this at age six, but then when the younger sibling is six they still need a present because \"they're little and don't understand\") The younger sibling will still get cake and ice cream without a present. They'll be fine.", "Yo that word is trippy. I hadn\u2019t heard it before but I like it", "NTA- J is a moron, and is going to end up with spoiled kids. If it's not your birthday you don't get a present. That's it.\n\nSidenote: My MIL used to bring a present for both kids on my sons birthday, but when it was my stepsons birthday there was only one present (and it was for him). I had to tell her to stop, and that we would no longer accept presents for my SS on my sons birthday.", "Um, no, NTA. \n\nYour friend is weird & he\u2019s teaching his kids to be selfish, entitled brats. They\u2019re his kids, so whatever, but he\u2019s not doing them any favors, I mean it\u2019s not like they\u2019re 4 & 5, they\u2019re both old enough to understand the concept of a birthday. (I\u2019m guessing he has some unresolved trauma around birthdays)\n\nAnd as for asking you to go get cash?  WTF?  No, that\u2019s weird, he\u2019s weird.", "NTA\n\nSure, there are some parents who get all the kids a gift on one kid's birthday.  I do not ascribe to that style, but you do you, boo.\n\nBut I have never heard of ANYONE demanding that everyone else also give all their kids a gift.\n\nLike, what - when the 14 year old's friend gets her a charm bracelet, do they call that child up and demand money for their youngest???\n\nWild, man.", "NTA my grandmother always did that when sis and I were kids and we were pretty sure it was because she couldn't remember whose birthday it actually was.  \n\nYou were nice enough to buy her child a birthday gift.  the correct response from her should have been \"thank you how kind of you to think of K\"", "I have 2 kids, when it's one of their birthdays I buy the other 1 gift. Usually it's something they were going to play together like a nerf each or something. But I would never insist other people bring them both each a gift, that is crazy and I wouldn't even think of that let alone actually go thru with asking people. NTA", "NTA.  \n\n\nOh my goodness, parents like this piss me all the way off. Kids are ALWAYS going to have different experiences, different opportunities, and different times when one gets a treat and their sibling doesn't. Is the mom going to insist that the oldest take the younger one to Prom with them? When the older one gets married are all the guests supposed to bring presents for the younger one too? It's ridiculous and stupid, and it's the reason why we end up with spoiled brats who think they get to blow out the candles at every birthday party.", "NTA. And that's wierd to expect guests to adhere to that. My parents only did that when we were VERY little, like 2-4 yrs old, but they didn't expect the rest of the family to follow suit and definitely wouldn't have sent them away to take out cash... ew.", "This cannot be real.", "NTA. Stay away from those weirdos", "my sister and i did get a very small present from our parents at each others bdays when we were smaller, but its absolutely ridiculous to expect that from a guest. NTA", "NTA. When my sister and I were really really little, we each got a present on the other\u2019s birthday, but the present was from our mom, not from anyone who came to our birthday parties. It\u2019s weird that she expected you to just know to bring a gift for the other child, even weirder that this child is 14 and still expects that.", "NTA- count your blessings that you don\u2019t have to deal with them as friends anymore. This is why so many kids feel entitled.", "NTA. Ridiculous position for them to take", "What in the world??! For one, how was OP supposed to know? Two it's like of them to even get K a present. Three that's a bad parenting move.", "Poor kids.\n\nTake your money, your gifts, and leave them.\n\nIF they actually expected you to bring a gift for the non-birthday kid, they should have spelled it out.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThey shouldn't expect a gift on another kid's birthday. That just sets them up for being ill-equipped to go to other kids' birthday parties.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI have encountered a similar practice where the youngest kids got presents on the oldest ones birthdays but the oldest ones didn't when it was the youngest ones birthday. Made the older kids feel like they weren't as loved. \n\nI understand that it's difficult seeing the younger kids struggle with their jealousy, but helping them with that is part of parenting. Making sure they never feel jealous is lousy parenting because it's setting them up to not knowing how to deal with it later in life.", "I think you dodged  bullett.  Run as fast as you can!", "NTA, that shit F'd up.", "I\u2019m confused on the people in the comments saying that it would be acceptable if the kid was younger. No. If you raise a child from birth to expect to always be gifted stuff when someone else is gifted that isn\u2019t something that they are just going to magically grow out of. You are setting an expectation that they will try to hold everyone else to for the rest of their life. If you don\u2019t want your 14 year old to throw a tantrum over not getting gifts on someone else\u2019s birthday, then you don\u2019t give them gifts on other people\u2019s birthday when they\u2019re three and five either. You just NEVER give them gifts on other peoples birthdays and that\u2019s how you teach your children that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around them. Also, the fact that they are feeding into her manipulative tactics, which are using her tears and anger as a way to manipulate and coerce people into buying her things is disgusting. these are the same parents who wonder why their kids are never invited to other kids birthday parties. Things like this need to be taught from birth. NTA btw.", "NTA\n\n??? I've never heard of of getting presents for both kids (HARD eye roll). They are setting themselves up for a lifetime of awful behavior. \n\nYou know what, kids have fun at parties! Not everyone has to get presents for it to be fun. Why teach such entitlement? What about when they go to a friend's birthday party? Are they going to expect a present? Ridiculous.\n\nIf I wanted my other child to get a cash present from you, I would have given *you* the cash to give to them, not demand that you go out and spend more money. How rude! You *already* went out of your way to purchase and wrap a gift. That was more than enough.\n\nYou are NOT WRONG. Their demand was ridiculous. They are not preparing their children for the real world.", "NTA. I do that with my nieces because they are my nieces. It\u2019s ridiculous to just expect it though and completely entitled", "NTA.\n\nIf a parent chooses a non-traditional way of handling birthdays (such as deciding that all siblings get gifts on everyone's birthday), then it is on THEM to notify other people \\*in advance of any birthday party\\*. It is not on guests to show up with bonus gifts because maybe, perchance this family expects something rather out of the ordinary.\n\nIt's also on these same parents to accept that deciding that their family requires bonus gifts will lead at least some potential guests to opt out of attending birthday parties, and gracefully accept that this is on them (the parents) and not a character flaw of the non-attendees.\n\nBecause J can't manage the second paragraph, J comes across as greedy.", "NTA is this real?  Someone actually demanded you leave to go get cash as a gift for their other child?", "That\u2019s a ridiculous rule that sounds more like a con. If it is legit, they should have told you first rather than trying to extort you on the day. NTA and these are not friends imo", "NTA. They are six years apart, kid was six maybe almost seven when his brother had his first birthday that's old enough to understand that only the birthday kid gets presents, parents were just too lazy to explain.", "They are setting their kids up for a horrible reality check. Gonna be some adults throwing childlike tantrums for not getting what they want or feeling left out", "I will never understand why people like getting gifts. The fun is in picking out a gift and making your friend/family happy. If I wanted something I\u2019ll just go to the store and get exactly what I want", "NTA. Time to ditch this person.", "You dodged a bullet.", "NTA - This is not a normal expectation. They should have been clear about this house rule in advance. They were not. This whole expectation they're setting is probably going to create problems later in life for those kids, but that is not your problem.", "A birthday is meant to be a special day for the person who was born on that day, not everyone in the room. \n\nYou said she's a new friend, take this as a huge hint not to continue the friendship.", "NTA\n\nIf the parents want to buy non birthday child one gift to not be left out,  that's on them,  but to expect every guest to buy for both children is ridiculous,  and since this is a freakish rule,  why no heads up before arriving?", "NTA.  That's quite presumptuous of your new \"friend.\"", "We did this when my kids were small\u2026like 3 and 5. But we didn\u2019t expect others to do it. We would just get the non-birthday kid something small to open so they wouldn\u2019t get bored. You are definitely NTA", "NTA\n\nand her kids are going to despise her later in life for this. She is creating a precedence where her kids can never be the focus on the moment. They will forever have to share their moments with their sibling and will feel like they can never have their own achievements.", "NTA!! I always get my kids a little something on each others birthdays because I choose to as a parent. I do not expect this from others and would be mortified to even think about doing so!", "NTA This is bizarre. I have 2 kids who are 4 years apart. I have NEVER given one a gift on the other's birthday. They would never expect it and aren't remotely unhappy when the other is celebrated. To expect you to cave to their cuckoo arrangement is beyond weird. If it was so important, the \"friend\" should've coughed up the cash and said it was from you even if it wasn't (and not expect you to repay them) because NO ONE does this but this wacky familiy.", "*They said that the kids always both get gifts on each others birthdays to make sure they don't feel left out.*\n\nUm T is 14, old enough to know that you don't get birthday presents when it's not your birthday. How is this going to work out when they get married and have families of their own?\n\nThey are setting their kids up for a world of hurt because most people aren't going to do this as they get older.", "Its wrong for the parents to put those expectations on others. Regardless of anything else, NTA", "My grandad always gives both me and my sibling a gift on both our birthdays although he\u2019s the only one who does it in my family and he decided to do it himself so it\u2019s just a sweet gesture.

Is T going to tell his wife \"oh, it's k's birthday where's MY gift?\" \nStupid", "Damn, the kids in my family would have made out...there are 7 of us!!! Can you imagine inviting someone to a birthday party and saying... oh by the way, you are of course bringing 7 presents aren't you?", "Wait, the kid is FOURTEEN?? I thought they were FOUR", "Unfortunately it isn't goofy. I've seen this many times where the parents absolutely INSIST that the non-birthday child/children be included in the presents. Admittedly the oldest I've seen is 11 or 12 but I have no problem believing that a 14 year old who was brought up to expect presents on their siblings' birthday wouldn't throw a fit (or similar). You can't just turn off that switch. You can't tell kids the world revolves around them and then expect them to automatically adjust when they are out on their own.", "\n\nDude sounds like a chore to me - it is a chore.", "I'm not so sure about the NC as both are being raised equally entitled. So I guess both live in the basement?", "they said both as in both kids get presents on both of their birthdays"]}
