Neither of us is great at keeping house so it is never company ready.  This year we were considering having our families over for Thanksgiving but hadn't decided for sure. Then he told me that his biological mom and sister who he found just over a year ago and I have never met in person are coming... OK so I guess we are hosting Thanksgiving (they later canceled unfortunately.) I told him we had a lot of work to do to get the house ready and he agreed.  So about 2 weeks ago I was getting more stressed.  I was trying to get some things done between 12 hour work shifts and knew I had planned a long stretch of days off to get things done.  But my husband really hasn't done anything.  I brought it up and he told me to make him a list.  So I did.  He has done one task on the list and several things that don't need done before Thanksgiving.  That is a typical thing for him. He will do this other thing like several loads of laundry that he can play video games between loads so that I can't complain about him not doing what I asked.  So now I have planned the meal, shopped for the meal, will be preparing the meal and have done 85% of the cleaning.  I reached my breaking point and told him this is the last time I am doing this if he can't do his part to get or keep our house ready for visitors. AITA?\n\nUpdate: I spoke to him again before I left for work tonight and point blank asked why he hasn't been helping more. He said that every holiday it is the same mad dash to clean and if we both kept up on it better or wouldn't be like that.  I said \"so you have been being passive-aggressive\" and he said \"yes I've been being an asshole\" I told him I agree we both need to do better but that doesn't fix the situation for Thursday. I told him to finish x,y and z tasks and we can figure out a better system moving forward. He agreed he should have talked to me about his frustration instead of being an ass.", "created_utc": 1700590705, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180nica/aita_for_telling_my_husband_we_wont_host_another/", "score": 1018, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Leave it for him to do. I'd also reassess if this is the life you want with a partner who doesn't respect you, is happy to let you drown in stress for his event, and who will never be a supportive equitable partner. God help you if you want children because he'll be a shit dad who 'babysits' as a favor to you when you take your 2 minute pees.\n\nYou need to think long and hard about what he contributes. Can you genuinely rely on him in case of an emergency. If shit hit the fan would be a caretaker or would he be one of the countless men who ditch their partners when she gets sick/I'll because he is so unused to actually having to do chores.\n\nYou need to honest reflect on would you ever treat him this way. Because all those reasons you wouldn't ever do this to him...does not apply to him. You probably wouldn't do this to him because you love him, value him, want to be support for one another...while he sees you as his work mule that he needs to devise a ready made excuse like he was doing laundry. He's essentially an overgrown toddler who claims he was wiping the table when expected to pitch in.\n\nFor the straight woman readers: \n\n1. Never get into a relationship with a male gamer. Gaming community is full of sexism and misogyny it does not bode well for an equitable mindset in a partner. There's a reason most unhappy women are with gamer bfs/husbands.\n\n2. Never assist a man with his family events because that's how you end up doing all/most of the work. He can make a list and do what is necessary do not even help him figure out what to do. No emotional labor for him. Stay out of it and make sure everyone attending knows it was all his doing.\n\nThe male commenters will chime in saying it's too harsh but remember men advocate for men. They're not giving advice for women to have happy healthy relationships. The same men telling a woman to give the benefit of the doubt, stop being so harsh, no one is perfect....when things go south those men will be telling her she should have chosen better.", "NTA - once my partner decided we were hosting something and invited people without consulting me, and wasn't showing any interest in helping out with the preps. So, I got all the prep done, night before said gathering, got called into work to cover for something or the other, told him everything upto that moment was on schedule, all he had to do was cook, clean, play host etc, and that I'd call when I was almost done or when someone else came in to cover for me. \nGot home 24hrs later \"when a replacement cover came in\" to find the kitchen in absolute chaos, his sisters and mother in the kitchen with him asking why he volunteered to host when he knew that in my line of work I was constantly on call and doing long shifts so there was no telling if a day off would actually be a day off and he knew darn well that he wouldn't be able to hold the fort if I was called I to work for an emergency. Needless to say, whenever he even starts to try to volunteer to host anything now, his sisters and mother immediately shut him down.", "NTA.\n\nIn my house, I'm the one that wants to host. Bf doesn't really care either way if we even celebrate. So because I want a big event with like 10 people, the cleaning and prep is up to me. I make my game plan, and things work out. \n\nI have made changes, though. To make life easier, we do fancy paper plates, so clean up is easy. We don't haul everything to our basement where we have room for a formal table, we make a buffet style line in the kitchen and people chill in the living room. It is not supposed to be a huge stressful thing, and if it's not something you enjoy, get good at buying delicious pies and join someone else's meal.\n\nAlso, I use video games as motivation to clean, so it's not fair to knock it. But unlike what you've described, I follow through. So play a round or two of my game, go do a load of dishes. Finish a dungeon, go clean the counter. Want to watch the next episode of my TV show I'm binging, go sweep the floor. I use it as a reward system, cause I can't do everything at once. But key factor is follow through. Don't start that next quest until you've gotten up and completed something on the list. \n\nGood luck with the discussion you're going to need to have. Hope things work out for you :)", "NTA but I might be an AH for telling you that my husband took the whole week off and has been doing yardwork, vacuuming ceilings, baseboards, and floors, mopping, and gave the dog a bath to get ready for Thanksgiving visitors.

It sounds like you are doing way more than half, and that is not fair. However, you have to stop doing more than your share, which is making you angry and resentful and is allowing him to act like a child. So how about, instead of you making the \"no guests\" rule and his getting pissed about that (even though you're being reasonable), you two sit down and make a commitment: We will have guests if and only if X, Y and Z happen. And they can't happen unless you work as a team, because they aren't all on your list.\n\nI will add one suggestion that really, really helped me and my wife: managing is a chore. If there's a person who figures out what needs doing, makes the list, and (heaven help us) nudge the other to do their part, THAT'S A JOB and something else should come off the manager's list to make sure they're in balance. I swear this has saved my marriage, and full disclosure: I'm usually your hubs in this scenario. My wife isn't resentful about having to manage things anymore, because she is no longer doing half the list PLUS the managing.\n\nAlso, managing tends to mean some nagging, and that is never fun for the nagger or naggee, so a couple of suggestions:\n\n1. When you make the list, also put \"done by\" dates so he still has some leeway about what he does when, but if, say, November 15 arrives and he hasn't done the things that are due by then, you can say \"November 15: the day for me to be done with the laundry and you to have fixed the downstairs toilet!\" as a gentle check-in.\n2. If you're feeling the need to remind him, instead ask him to problem-solve with you. \"The time is getting short. I don't want to nag you and I know you don't want to be nagged. Can you tell me what your plan is between now and the 23rd so that I can relax?\"\n\n(And if he starts making a habit of staying on top of things, then when you anxiously nag him some time, he can say, \"I got everything done in time last holiday, right? So please chill! I am working my way through my list!\" Again, I've been your hubs in this situation, and being able to say that made both me and my wife very happy.)\n\nGood luck!", "NTA.
