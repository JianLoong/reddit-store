Neither of us is great at keeping house so it is never company ready.  This year we were considering having our families over for Thanksgiving but hadn't decided for sure. Then he told me that his biological mom and sister who he found just over a year ago and I have never met in person are coming... OK so I guess we are hosting Thanksgiving (they later canceled unfortunately.) I told him we had a lot of work to do to get the house ready and he agreed.  So about 2 weeks ago I was getting more stressed.  I was trying to get some things done between 12 hour work shifts and knew I had planned a long stretch of days off to get things done.  But my husband really hasn't done anything.  I brought it up and he told me to make him a list.  So I did.  He has done one task on the list and several things that don't need done before Thanksgiving.  That is a typical thing for him. He will do this other thing like several loads of laundry that he can play video games between loads so that I can't complain about him not doing what I asked.  So now I have planned the meal, shopped for the meal, will be preparing the meal and have done 85% of the cleaning.

Maybe apply some critical thinking before posting :)", "Agreed, making the list can even be one of the \u201cchores\u201d, so just factor that in, I make lists for myself anyway", "I don't know why you are getting downvoted on this. We always use lists for bigger events like hosting a party. Not just because different things are important to different family members, but also to not forget stuff when things get hectic and to plan our time accordingly (on our list we also add cakes that can be prepared a day in advance for example).\n\nBut: everyone adds to the list and everyone works on the list", "Yes lists are great! I'm glad you highlighted the work as an example of lists helping, but if you had the ability to read you might notice that story is not between employee and manager, it is actually between a husband and wife so that is a very different dynamic :) Expecting your spouse to act like your mommy and boss is not! OP's husband is an adult, he can figure out what needs to be done in his own home for his own guests by himself without asking her to do extra labor to manage him. Let's apply a some critical thinking before posting next time, okay?", "Your boss is being paid specifically to manage your work and direct your priorities.", "Good for you. Stand your ground, and do not fall for this again.", "Right, maybe when you have the mental space to handle  it you start mixing up your chores in a way that bugs him. Like instead of doing his laundry tell him you wiped down the countertops and he can't get mad because you are helping. Bonus points if it is food related - like if he asks what's for dinner just reply 'i put gas in the car and made the bed.'", "Leave the house a mess, cook a basic, passable dinner. Don't do anything that was on his list. When you're hosting, tell them that you're sorry the place is a mess, but hubby promised to help, but didn't do the things on the list and you didn't have time after your shifts. Make him feel ashamed.", "Even if he invites people without consulting you? Like he did this time?", "Ooh I love this that\u2019s a much better idea!", "It was originally going to be the recently found bio mom and sister, his parents who raised him, and my parents.  Bio family canceled so now just the rest of the families.", "If he can't cook, then the whole thing was a waste.  I'm not saying she's done anything wrong, but perhaps if he knows how to cook, that's something he'll do instead since she's done enough already.", "This is the way.  Sometimes you just have to do it.  I have a wife (mostly lucky me) but I was doing ALL the dinners during COVID and it was frustrating we didn't go back to 30/70 (I was 70) after so I just said I'll do abcd days, you do efg.  Then didn't do efg.  It was rough for a while, canned beans for months.  But now she's in the swing of things and I'm so much less resentful.  My kids still complain about the instant pot meals but I'm happy enough and I'm like \"it's mama's night!\" when they complain.", "I gotcha I think, so the issue with the gaming is that he's using the length of time it takes to do laundry to avoid doing the other stuff when in reality laundry is a relatively passive task except for folding at the end. Does that sound right? \n\nThe one thing that I would have said it makes sense to kind of put off till the last minute would have been the Kitchen since that's continually in use and getting dirty through daily cooking/eating but that was on your list haha. \n\nYeah I don't think you're wrong at all. I'm a single guy but I host some large family events at my house and I understand the amount of work it takes to get a house ready, even when it's just my house with just my mess. It's a lot. If you have your partner signing you both up to host, and then doesn't want to contribute themselves that's not cool. \n\nMaybe try explaining your perspective from an angle like this, \"[name], look, I don't mind hosting events with your family, it's always a good time when they come over. (Sets the tone that it's not his family you have an issue with) However, I really need you to be a more active participant in getting things done to prep for it. Right now I feel like you're signing me up as a single volunteer to get all this stuff done. How would you feel if I signed you up at [church/place you enjoy going to/ work place] to do 3 hours a day of work without consulting with you or helping you in any way?\n\nIf he reacts completely negatively to that, I'd just be like yeah fuck it then, I'm not doing any work to host events for your family.", ">you might not be trying but you sure are succeeding at sounding intentionally obtuse. \n\nI try to get extremely clear information before passing judgement on stuff. What one person may think is very obvious, may not be obvious to everyone. \n\n>doing his own laundry is not on the list of thanksgiving prep.\n\nWell it certainly shouldn't be that's just basic living, but the laundry thing was just listed as an aside of another annoying habit he had without it being clear if it was related to the Thanksgiving prep list. It also didn't say anything about it just being his laundry. \n\n>the list i\u2019m sure included tasks that are more living space/kitchen centered.\n\nI would assume so as well \n\n>The request for her to spell it out when he has taken part in hosting with OP before is flaming hot weaponized incompetence.\n\nAll I was asking was if things were spelled out as to what needs to get done before/after and since the thing about laundry was mentioned as an aside of \"other things he does that's annoying\" if she's asking him to do other things as well as laundry at the same time. I'm not asking her to spell it out for him, I'm asking for her to spell it out for me because I don't live with them and I have one small fragment of story to go off of here.\n\n>he wanted guests over, he did nothing to prep.\n\nHe didn't do *nothing* he just didn't do nearly enough from OP's perspective (and likely in reality).", "Ah, I thought it was just the bio fam"]}
