My wife passed away 6 years ago in an accident.\n\nI've gone (and still go) to therapy to deal with this and believe I've done the best for my child and been the best I can be. But one thing I haven't been able to move on from is my love for my wife and dating/being in a relationship with someone else. \n\nThis is something my sister unfortunately is unable to get. She has a husband and 3 kids and has a 'perfect family life' in her words. Since 6 months after my wife passed, she's been dropping hints about getting me on dates, setting me up with women she knows , and it's just got more and more persistent over time. It's my fault for not shutting it down earlier. \n\nMy daughter is very close with her cousins and hangs out at their home a lot. Last week she came home and asked why I 'don't want to give her a new mother so we can be normal '. I asked where she got that idea from and she said my sister told her that I was selfish and only concerned about myself and not her. I lost it and called her right then, telling her to stay out of this and that enough is enough. She called me an asshole and gaslit me, saying I care only about myself and not for giving my daughter a 'normal' upbringing. I was so disgusted and haven't spoken to her since.\n\nNow I feel I might be an AH for being selfish? Also I need to get along with my sister for my daughter's sake.

Um definitely NTA. Maybe the biggest NTA I\u2019ve seen on here in a long time. You should *never* date someone if you aren\u2019t ready and can you imagine how shitty it would be for the woman you did date before you were ready to find out you were just dating her to fulfill your sister\u2019s weird version of a \u201cperfect family\u201d? \n\nPlease don\u2019t do that to yourself, your daughter, or this hypothetical woman. \n\nI hate to extrapolate but my guess is that if sister is always going on about how perfect her family is she doth protest too much. As in, most people with very good families don\u2019t need to tell everyone how perfect everything is, and they aren\u2019t trying to \u201cfix\u201d other families. \n\nI get you need to stay close to your sister for your daughter\u2019s sake but you also need to put in SOLID boundaries with your sister for your daughter\u2019s sake. Like making sure she knows that if she says that shit to your daughter again there will be a significant break from your daughter spending time with her. And stick to that. She needs to know you\u2019re serious and she can\u2019t bully you", "NTA. What is your sister smoking, for thinking and expressing and insisting that there's only one way to have a \"normal\" family. It's bullshit. There are single dad's and mom's, kids with 2 moms or two dads, kids with bio parents and stepparents, etc -- the variations go on and on. It's shameful that she's trying to male your daughter think her life isn't normal, and that it's weird that you're not dating. Especially when she has her aunt and cousins in her life, and her aunt could have been her go-to mom/women figure as long as she's needed. You definitely shouldn't date until you feel ready and on your timeframe. It wouldn't be fair to a woman to hustle her along in a relationship when you aren't ready, and try to slot her into a \"mom\" role, and women that *are* willing to do that aren't guaranteed to be a good mom to your daughter.", "NTA. Your sister was absolutely out of line to talk to your child like that, that is a disgusting thing to say to someone who has lost their mother. It doesn't matter if you aren't in the dating scene, there are MANY amazing single parents and I'm sure you're doing a great job. Your sister needs to learn some boundaries. Wish you and your daughter the best <3", "OMG NTA!\n\nI can't believe your sister is so meddling and manipulative. \n\nSet a firm boundary with her and hold fast to it. \n\nAs an aside, I really can't stand it when people go on dates they really don't want to go on because they were pushed. It isn't fair to the other person.\n\nI'm so sorry for the loss of your spouse, and only you know if and when your heart is healed enough to open it again. Best wishes to you.", "NTA.\n\nI'm still grieving for my wife who passed 2 and a half years ago.  I have no children but when someone, usually family, say's I should \"get over it\"... it makes me really angry!  I'll get over my grief and loss when I am good and ready... I'm not on someone else's timeline.\n\nThat your sister would manipulate your child as leverage against you is vile beyond words.  Sorry for your loss.  It's sad you are here.", "You\u2019re not selfish, you\u2019re healing. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Perhaps your sister has good intentions and wants to see you and your daughter taken care of. However you are perfectly capable of taking care of your daughter yourself and don\u2019t need a woman to do that work. \n\nAlso if your sister is that concerned, she can step into a bit of a mommy role when a woman\u2019s touch is needed (e.g., teaching about makeup, feminine products, hair dying, etc)", "Big NTA. Damn, the nerve of your sister. And to go as far as tell an 8 year old that her family isn't normal. A friend's father died when he was 10, and his sister was 8-9. Their mother never remarried, it happens sometimes, and it's OK. I would go low/no contact with her because she is clearly toxic. And definitely not let your daughter have any contact with her. \n\nJust wow.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is awful.  Truly awful.  It doesn't matter if you never decide to date again.\n\nIt is none of your sister's business and that she tried to use your child to get her way is despicable.\n\nTell her one last time to mind her own business and if she persists, it's time to cut contact.\n\nAnytime I see a post title that is about \"telling my wife or my sister to mind her own business\" the answer is always going to be NTA.\n\nBut I also know doing so is probably futile.  It's ingrained in their DNA.", "NTA. She can\u2019t seem to leave well-enough alone, and is constantly pushing buttons where she knows it hurts you most. Your sister should let you grieve, no matter how long it takes.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m so sorry. \n\nHonestly, if you try to force some random replacement mother on your daughter, she may resent you for it in the future", "Nta", "NTA, you are under no obligation to remarry just cause your sister thinks you should. My guess is she thinks that you as a man can't raise a daughter on your own so a woman needs to step in and take care of that for you. If you don't feel like dating now or never that's your decision. I'd keep my daughter from her aunt's house for a while cause she is going to cause problems.", "NTA. What is \"normal\" anyway? Your daughter has a home with a parent who loves her; that should suffice. Would your sister prefer that you date simply with the intent in mind of gaining a mother figure for your daughter, rather than you gaining a life partner? Just because she's married, doesn't make it \"normal\".\n\nJust because you are a widower, does not make you any less of a parent than the rest of us or your family unit abnormal. Your sister needs to MYOB. While it's nice that your daughter is close to her cousins, its time to foster relationships and activities outside the family. Your sister is not a good person for her to be around. Honestly, I start cutting down contact with her and her family.", "NTA", "NTA.  Normal is a setting on the dryer (or at least it used to be!)  Your normal right now is you and your daughter.  When and if you both want that to change, it will.  Until then your sister needs to butt out!", "NTA. The love of your life passed away this year. Your sister could be a bit more understanding but I think maybe it would help if you sat down and talked to her about it.\n\n Life\u2019s not as simple as making everything \u201cperfect\u201d by replacing people who have passed. She\u2019s being way too dismissive of your grieving process. I hope things get better for you and your daughter, but don\u2019t feel selfish for caring about your wife.", ">I asked where she got that idea from and she said my sister told her that I was selfish and only concerned about myself and not her\n\nINFO: your sister said this to an 8 year old? *really*? An 8 year old. You are asking us to believe your 8 year old told you \"aunt said you were selfish and only concerned about yourself\"?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not sure there is such a thing as a \"normal\" upbringing. If there is, unfortunately, daughter lost that opportunity already when her Mother died, which cannot be easy. It sounds like you are doing the best you can in the situation. Also, I'm sorry, but it wouldn't be fair to the women you would date if your approach was recruiting a substitute Mom. Maybe you'll find love in the future, but it needs to happen in your own time.", "NTA but your sister is for saying such things to you and your daughter. You have the right to NOT want another partner for now OR ever. Your choice.", "NTA- you might wanna try to tell or explain to your daughter your sister her aunt is wrong. Tell her you still love her mom. She has been using your kids against you and that is so wrong on many levels. Might wanna have less contact with her...she planted a lot of bad seed on your daughter's head.", "OP, you\u2019re NTA. You get to choose when you move on.\n\nYour sister, though, is an AH of the highest order. What nerve she has to brainwash your daughter to think you\u2019re denying her of a new mother, and then accusing you of being selfish.", "NTA: Normal doesn't have to be mom/dad/2.5 kids white picket fence.  Normal is a healthy version of what you have. The therapy is good, please keep doing that.  Whether or not you date again is up to you.  Whether or not you talk to your sister again is up to you.  \n\nAnd your daughter is old enough (please tell me she has gotten therapy as well?) to express her feelings about things.  Talk with her - in age appropriate terms - and see how she actually feels about things not what your sister has told her to say.", "NTA, sis is. \n\nBut, your daughter likely has zero memory of her mother. Have you shown her pics, movies, memorabilia about her? Just to let her know that she was the love of your life, and you aren't ready to move on? That it would be unfair to the new woman, for you to give her less than all of your heart? Shit like that.", "NTA --- Tell your sister instead of introducing these women to you introduce them to her husband so he can find an even better wife and mother for his kids and see if she likes the disrespect.", "She did. I've paraphrased it for the post of course.", "So can you tell us exactly what 8 year old said that could be paraphrased down to \"you are selfish and only concerned about yourself.\" ? Specifics matter if you want judgment here. (If it's not clear - I think this is a bait post)", "It was part of a larger conversation they were having about families and me. I wasn't there for the conversation.  And honestly I don't care if you think this is a bait post or not. Have a good day.", "Dude, don\u2019t worry; I believe you.  8 year olds definitely can be articulate and even if they aren\u2019t they know how to rely a direct quote, especially since it\u2019s probably not the first time your sister has said that.  That commenter is tripping as hard as your sister.", "That's not what I asked you to explain, but ok cool. There's a ton of bait posts here, so when an OP *can't tell us what his 8 year old specifically said to him*, it sets off alarms. But if you can't tell us what she said to you, then I guess you can't", "Honestly I\u2019m confused why you really feel an 8 year old couldn\u2019t say this. Are you around many children that age? An 8 year old would absolutely say that if they were told it", "OP said he paraphrased what she said to him. I asked him what she specifically said and he didn't answer. That's my issue. If my 8 year old told me something like this, I'd absolutely remember what she said verbatim, as it would be gutting. That's all"]}
