Um definitely NTA. Maybe the biggest NTA I\u2019ve seen on here in a long time. You should *never* date someone if you aren\u2019t ready and can you imagine how shitty it would be for the woman you did date before you were ready to find out you were just dating her to fulfill your sister\u2019s weird version of a \u201cperfect family\u201d? \n\nPlease don\u2019t do that to yourself, your daughter, or this hypothetical woman. \n\nI hate to extrapolate but my guess is that if sister is always going on about how perfect her family is she doth protest too much. As in, most people with very good families don\u2019t need to tell everyone how perfect everything is, and they aren\u2019t trying to \u201cfix\u201d other families. \n\nI get you need to stay close to your sister for your daughter\u2019s sake but you also need to put in SOLID boundaries with your sister for your daughter\u2019s sake. Like making sure she knows that if she says that shit to your daughter again there will be a significant break from your daughter spending time with her. And stick to that. She needs to know you\u2019re serious and she can\u2019t bully you", "NTA. What is your sister smoking, for thinking and expressing and insisting that there's only one way to have a \"normal\" family. It's bullshit. There are single dad's and mom's, kids with 2 moms or two dads, kids with bio parents and stepparents, etc -- the variations go on and on. It's shameful that she's trying to make your daughter think her life isn't normal, and that it's weird that you're not dating. Especially when she has her aunt and cousins in her life, and her aunt could have been her go-to mom/women figure as long as she's needed. You definitely shouldn't date until you feel ready and on your timeframe. It wouldn't be fair to a woman to hustle her along in a relationship when you aren't ready, and try to slot her into a \"mom\" role, and women that *are* willing to do that aren't guaranteed to be a good mom to your daughter.", "NTA. Your sister was absolutely out of line to talk to your child like that, that is a disgusting thing to say to someone who has lost their mother. It doesn't matter if you aren't in the dating scene, there are MANY amazing single parents and I'm sure you're doing a great job. Your sister needs to learn some boundaries. Wish you and your daughter the best <3", "OMG NTA!\n\nI can't believe your sister is so meddling and manipulative. \n\nSet a firm boundary with her and hold fast to it. \n\nAs an aside, I really can't stand it when people go on dates they really don't want to go on because they were pushed.

Best wishes to you.", "NTA.\n\nI'm still grieving for my wife who passed 2 and a half years ago.  I have no children but when someone, usually family, say's I should \"get over it\"... it makes me really angry!  I'll get over my grief and loss when I am good and ready... I'm not on someone else's timeline.\n\nThat your sister would manipulate your child as leverage against you is vile beyond words.  Sorry for your loss.  It's sad you are here.", "You\u2019re not selfish, you\u2019re healing. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Perhaps your sister has good intentions and wants to see you and your daughter taken care of.

Damn, the nerve of your sister. And to go as far as tell an 8 year old that her family isn't normal. A friend's father died when he was 10, and his sister was 8-9.

It doesn't matter if you never decide to date again.\n\nIt is none of your sister's business and that she tried to use your child to get her way is despicable.\n\nTell her one last time to mind her own business and if she persists, it's time to cut contact.\n\nAnytime I see a post title that is about \"telling my wife or my sister to mind her own business\" the answer is always going to be NTA.\n\nBut I also know doing so is probably futile.  It's ingrained in their DNA.", "NTA. She can\u2019t seem to leave well-enough alone, and is constantly pushing buttons where she knows it hurts you most. Your sister should let you grieve, no matter how long it takes.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m so sorry. \n\nHonestly, if you try to force some random replacement mother on your daughter, she may resent you for it in the future", "Nta", "NTA, you are under no obligation to remarry just cause your sister thinks you should. My guess is she thinks that you as a man can't raise a daughter on your own so a woman needs to step in and take care of that for you. If you don't feel like dating now or never that's your decision. I'd keep my daughter from her aunt's house for a while cause she is going to cause problems.", "NTA. What is \"normal\" anyway? Your daughter has a home with a parent who loves her; that should suffice. Would your sister prefer that you date simply with the intent in mind of gaining a mother figure for your daughter, rather than you gaining a life partner? Just because she's married, doesn't make it \"normal\".\n\nJust because you are a widower, does not make you any less of a parent than the rest of us or your family unit abnormal. Your sister needs to MYOB. While it's nice that your daughter is close to her cousins, its time to foster relationships and activities outside the family. Your sister is not a good person for her to be around. Honestly, I start cutting down contact with her and her family.", "NTA", "NTA.  Normal is a setting on the dryer (or at least it used to be!)  Your normal right now is you and your daughter.  When and if you both want that to change, it will.  Until then your sister needs to butt out!", "NTA. The love of your life passed away this year. Your sister could be a bit more understanding but I think maybe it would help if you sat down and talked to her about it.\n\n Life\u2019s not as simple as making everything \u201cperfect\u201d by replacing people who have passed.

At your age it\u2019s not the norm for you to still be grieving and not dating. I think your wife would be sad to know you\u2019re still in therapy and haven\u2019t moved on.", "NTA. Holy crap, your sister is VILE!", "OP says he needs to keep sis in his life for his daughter\u2019s sake, but is it really in the daughter\u2019s best interests keeping her around? If sis is influencing the kid against her dad, and sowing these untruths in her mind... OP is potentially setting himself up for the daughter to be alienated and resentful towards him, because sis can\u2019t mind her business.", "Given how many posts we see here from kids whose surviving parent wanted to make sure they had a new mom/dad, there are a LOT of ways that scenario can turn out badly.\n\nOP, has your daughter also been going to therapy? It might be good for her to have an outside perspective, and be able to voice her needs to someone who isn't involved in the situation, since your sister is clearly trying to weaponize your child to make you fall into line with her own desires.", "\" Get over it\" Said by people who have probably never lost a spouse. Sorry for your loss. Sister is definitely practicing parental alienation. OP should only allow supervised visits.", "I\u2019m wondering if the constant badgering has the opposite effect as well. That if sis is at this \u201cwhen are you going to start dating\u201d spiel every time OP sees her, that it\u2019s colouring OP\u2019s feelings towards dating again. Like, he\u2019ll never organically reach that point if he actively being bullied about it on a regular basis.  \n\nHe may never want to, and that\u2019s totally fine. But having someone constantly going \u201cYou ready yet? How about now?...Now?!\u201d has got to create a negative association and make the grieving process even harder.", "It's not your business.", "OP, talk to your daughter in simple terms to explain why sister is wrong, should have kept her mouth shut, and is now in time out for two months.  Then get your daughter into counseling so she has an unbiased professional to talk to.", "I know your daughter is only 8, but I really think you should talk to her in an age appropriate way about what your sister said to her and about how your guys' loss is still hurting you. You still love your wife/her mother, and you always will. It'll not only help her understand the current situation more somewhat, but It'll hopefully let her know as she grows, and if you do start dating, that you're not trying to erase/replace her mother. Its not an easy situation to be in and its disgusting how your sister is so quick to replace your wife. Absolutely NTA. You're in therapy. Take your time, even if it takes another 10 years.", "Any option you give your daughter a normal aunt?\n\nNTA. And you sound like an awesome parent.", "What is selfish is marrying to give your child a mother, as you recognise.\n\nYour sister has no business making these comments. NTA", "NTA, your sister is messed up, I agree with the comments saying to reduce or cut contact. For your daughter having a good relationship with her cousin is awesome but it's not worth the mental health of her father or her feeling ostracized because she doesn't have a mom. Cousins are great but only if their parents are cool as well or if they aren't attached to their parents.\nAlso either your sister is very and unhealthy bigoted towards single parents or she's unhappy in her marriage and neither option is something you want your daughter around.", "Nta\n\nYou're doing nothing wrong.  Your happiness matters, and your daughter will agree when she's older.  \n\nI've been in your shoes.  I had my daughter in '02 and lost the love of my life a few months later.  Didn't date again for about 12 years and only did because family made me feel like I was doing something wrong.  I ended up unhappy and he ended up broken hearted.  I went back to not dating.  It hasn't affected my daughter.  She had a great childhood, was happy and loved, and isn't upset she didn't have a father figure in the house.  She knows I'm happy with my life.  My mom keeps insisting I need to find someone and get married or I'll be lonely and sad.  I tell her I'm anything but.  Maybe that will change one day, maybe not.  \n\nLive your life and don't worry about your sister.  Be happy with your beautiful little girl and enjoy every moment.", "Nope. NTA.

It takes time to grieve and six months really isn\u2019t that long.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want a relationship, you shouldn\u2019t look for one. I don\u2019t understand why your sister can\u2019t see how much worse it would be for you to start a relationship and have it blow up because you\u2019re not ready.", "NTA", "My dad never remarried or dated after mom died. I was 15 and the youngest brother was 6. Not one date. \n\nIt was the best decision he could have made for our household. \n\nHow can you be selfish if you\u2019d daughter is your whole world.

Are there cousins there that your daughter can hang out with?\n\nYour sister is quite toxic to your daughter with what she is saying to her.  Your daughter may not be old enough to really remember her mother but that's beside the point.  She still has memories but they won't be as clear as if she was older.\n\nDo you think your sister would be saying the same thing to your daughter if she was 5 when your wife died and 10/11 now?\n\nIf you do need to keep relations cordial with your sister, I would probably make sure that you supervise when your daughter is at their place.  So instead of dropping her off at the house, or having your sister pick her up.  I'd actually go there.  Build a relationship with her husband if you need and haven't got that closeness.  He may keep your sister in line somewhat (he shouldn't have to but she may chew his ear off about the situation and he'll tell her what he really thinks).\n\nAt least supervise while your daughter is this young.  As she gets older, then this will be less of an issue.  She'll probably have friends who may struggle with stepparents  and she may see the parallels that you've avoided.  It's a completely different situation but both involve other people being present that fulfil a role as the other parents they don't live with.\n\nDo you think your daughter might benefit from some therapy.  Even family therapy with both of you.  This is more because of what your sister is saying to her that may have been going on for a lot longer than you realise.", "NTA - You are doing what's right for you and your child. Good Grief, it isn't your sister's business.", "NTA, you read too many posts on here from children upset because their parent married right away to replace the missing parent.  You should not marry just to make your family \"normal.\"  Look at the world today. There are all kinds of normal.  Love your child she is what matters, not the s**t your sister puts in her head.   Honestly, if I were to lose my husband, I'd never marry again, but I'd be the best parent I could be.  Sounds like you are doing that.", "NTA. This theoretical new woman could be abusive to your daughter for all anyone knows. You do what's right in your mind. Don't succumb to peer pressure.", "NTA Your sister trying to dictate that you take a new bedmate is really kind of invasive. Her doing parental alienation of her own brother is kind of low key incestuous. Isn't that what former spouses and lovers do? You might want to tell her these things and also prevent your daughter from ever seeing her again. Hang outs happen at your house or not at all.", "Your sister has reached the stage where she's hurting your daughter in order to make her own bullying more successful. Do you want your daughter to be subjected to that? By anybody?", "NTA.  Tell your sis if you even suspect that she says something similar to your daughter, you'll be rethinking whether she's a good influence for your daughter.  Tell her you will date whenever you're ready and that may be never.  Single parents exist and can be all that a child needs.  Not everyone has the same idea of what a perfect family is.
