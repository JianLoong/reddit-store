Since our birthdays were right next to each other, we thought it would be a good idea to celebrate together. I initially had agreed because it seemed like a good idea. Our birthday is two months from now. However, last night, my parents told me they\u2019d appreciate if I spent my birthday with them this year since I haven\u2019t been able to since I started working at 20. I felt bad and agreed. I immediately told my friend this and communicated how I wanted to make it up to her. She immediately shut off and acted silent and distant. She said it was okay but she left me on read when I tried to ask if everything was ok. I don\u2019t understand? Would she rather I lied to her? Or tell her last minute? Did she expect that I\u2019d say no to my parents and go with her instead?\n\nEdit: A lot of people have been saying I should add more context so here it is (sorry this is my first time posting!) \n\nMy friend planned a two day weekend trip for her birthday and since our birthdays were next to each other, she figured we\u2019d celebrate it together. I agreed and we looked into some things we could do. Everything is still at the planning stage at this point. I also need to clarify that the trip isn\u2019t ONLY the two of us, of course. We have other girls coming who are mostly her friends since this was originally her idea (I don\u2019t mind either, I don\u2019t have much friends and her friends are super civil with me). However, when my parents called recently and asked if it\u2019s okay for me to celebrate with them for the first time in five years, I couldn\u2019t say no. I\u2019ve been working non-stop since I migrated and now that I had the money to fly back to my home country, being on the vacation with my friend just felt wrong. I also owe a lot to my parents since they\u2019ve worked day and night to be able to bring me to where I am now. I also do work 7 times a week because I have 3 different jobs I attend to. \n\nOf course I told my friend this, but she acted cold and distant. It\u2019s been five days and I\u2019ve been trying to contact her but she\u2019s left me on read and blocked me on some of our socials. It really hurts me that she couldn\u2019t see my side even if I was really understanding of hers. I know it was hurtful for me to cancel but I didn\u2019t entirely ghost her. In fact, I told her that we can celebrate another way in another time where it could be just the two of us since I felt so bad. I\u2019ve already said sorry but I was also hoping she\u2019d also understand my part. When you\u2019ve been financially struggling all your life and when you\u2019re finally able to afford to give back to your parents, this really was an opportunity I couldn\u2019t pass out on.\n\nUpdate: Been reading all your replies and it really has given me a wider and broad POV with this whole situation! I do see the error of my mistakes in this and have been taking accountability. I really did try to communicate right away on what i can do to make it up to her (and if we can find a compromise) however, it seems like she really isn\u2019t willing. I can\u2019t really force her to forgive me but I\u2019m glad I got to share this entire situation with this community \u25e1\u0308", "created_utc": 1683544295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bluyl/aita_for_telling_my_friend_i_had_unexpected_plans/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019ve been honest and told her ASAP, so she can make other plans. She\u2019s hurt, which is understandable. Give her time.", "NTA, but your birthdays are next to each other, not the same day; why can't you change to celebrating on her bday?", "NTA. It\u2019s rude to cancel plans but from the sounds of things you didn\u2019t have set plans you had ideas you never booked anything or paid for anything and she\u2019s not out anything with you pulling out. Canceling for other friends or a partner would have made this a Y T A situation but family is different you want to spend time with your family while you have them.", "Considering she has other people going and you hadn't actually made concrete travel or accommodation plans I can't see how you will really change her weekend. Unless she needed your money to pay her way? Sounds like this was the last straw and she doesn't want to be friends any more, which is great to learn now, so you don't waste any more time with her and you can not feel bad about that valuable time with your parents. She feels bitter for some reason and instead of actually being your friend and talking about it, or understanding your family is important to you with what little time you have free, she would rather cut you off. You're better off.\n\nnta", "It sucks but 2 months notice is enough time for her to schedule something else. \n\nNtA", "It's quite rude to cancel plans because something else you'd rather do comes up. Even with \"sufficient\" advance notice, you give the first person the distinct feeling that they're second-best. Plans can only legitimately be canceled (unilaterally) for emergency, non-negotiable, unpleasant circumstances, like a funeral or a work function. \n\nInstead, you *contact* the person with whom you've made the original plans and *agree* to a change (\"Hi, best friend. Is it OK if we reschedule our coffee date? I've just won an all-expense paid round-the-world cruise!\"). But this should be put as a *question*, not as a done deal. \n\nSo YTA for agreeing to your parents' trip and canceling the one you had planned with your friend. Even if neither of you had spent any money on it yet, it leaves her with nothing to do on her birthday, when you and she had a nice weekend holiday planned.", "NTA these things happen, but give her a minute, she doesn't have to be a jerk about it any more than she has to be happy about it. I will say this, regardless of intentions if/when things do get patched up I wouldn't expect to make advanced plans with this person again, trust for that sort of thing is gone.", "Edit YTA op wtf why did you leave out that was a trip and not a party. Leaving out the details makes you an asshole. \n\nOriginal comment because idk how to do the crossy out line lmao 2 months is so much notice.", "YTA.  Why can't you do both, even if you don't do one or either of the get-togethers on the day-of? It's two months away, which should leave plenty of time to plan. I feel like you are leaving out something, like maybe you don't actually want to do a shared celebration.  It's probably also occurred to your friend that's it's possible to do both if you genuinely wanted to.", "Canceling on a friend 2 months in advance, makes you NTA.  Your friend should be a bit more understanding.  But what I don't understand is why don't you just choose another weekend?  Why does it have to be the bday weekend, can't you just rs for another one?", "NTA. It was plenty of notice and nothing was paid for yet. And in my book, family always trumps friends, especially if you haven't seen them in a long time.", "YTA. Yes she expected you to tell your parents you had plans. Because you had plans. Nobody died. Nobody was sick. You just blew her off for a better offer.", "Slight YTA, with tones of N A H.\n\nYou agreed to the trip, then flaked. Your reasons are your reasons, but that is what happened.\n\nYou want to see your family, and have every right! But you have to acknowledge how changing the plan that was already difficult to find time for would effect her in the plans you were making **together.**\n\nYou over committing yourself over the same timeframe is what\u2019s at issue, and what makes you the AH. It comes across as rude and dismissive of the time other try to allocate to spend with you.\n\nThis is an intent vs impact situation. Your intent was to please everybody by shifting the time, but the impact is you change plans that were already difficult to establish to better fit your schedule. Again, I get your reasoning, but the impact is that it inconveniences the other people around you.", "YTA. You never cancel plans with someone because something better came along. It just makes them feel poopy. You should have told your parents you had plans on that day and time and asked them if they could meet at a different time or day.", "What exactly were the plans? Where were you in the planning stage? I feel like there is some relevant information missing. I also don\u2019t see why it has to be one or the other.

But overall NTA", "Nta for cancelling you did so well in advance and it\u2019s a family request so to some those trump other requests. I would say to cut your friend some slack. It\u2019s okay that your friend is disappointed that y\u2019all\u2019s plans changed. Especially since you mentioned she doesn\u2019t have many other friends out side of you. Give your friend time to feel a bit better before questioning your friendship", "NTA. family comes first. Your friend may be sad which is a given, but you at least let them know ASAP instead of last minute.\n\nAlso it wouldnt hurt to celebrate both of your birthdays together a month later/after the two months, that way you both can still get to go on a trip together and celebrate. You still have the rest of the year to celebrate being your new ages as well!", "YTA. It wasn't unexpected.", "YTA - 24 hours in a day\u2026 couldn\u2019t you celebrate with your parents at another time? Go have some nice breakfast? Go out for lunch? I understand that you want to celebrate with them but you\u2019re an adult and you have responsibilities. You can promise to celebrate with them next year", "Op, your an AH for making it sound like a small birthday dinner or something. You cancelled your trip with your friend to go on a different bigger trip. Of course she\u2019s upset. I still understand why you\u2019d choose to go see your parents instead but it\u2019s not like it was just \u201cplans\u201d with your friend. NAH for the overall situation though.", "Yta", "YTA, so a better offer came up and you cancel the trip with your friend? Yeah you do suck for that. But what I don\u2019t understand is that you didn\u2019t even try to make it work. You are visiting your parents for a couple of weeks. So why didn\u2019t you just go on the trip and then spend the remaining weeks with your parents? It feels as though you got your better offer, and took it, rather than working on a compromise. I think that\u2019s why she feels so slighted, because there was no attempt from you, just a straight cancellation on a trip she was planning for both of you.", "YTA. Everyone I know rarely celebrates a birthday on the actual date. It\u2019s almost always a convenient day before or after. Family should be particularly understanding of this. Are you saying it\u2019s been five years since you celebrated with your parents *on your actual birthday*, but you have celebrated on a close day and your parents really want your actual birthday with you this time? I\u2019m guessing not. Can you plan two trips? If not, I think you should favor the previously planned trip.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s very different to planning a trip with you for the purposes of sharing birthday plans. The first scenario you dipping doesn\u2019t do much of anything because she already has her original plans to fall back on. The second scenario makes you a bigger AH\n\nbut I think she can also give you some grace and understanding. Family is just as important as friends.
