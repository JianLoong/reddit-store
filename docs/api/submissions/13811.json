After work or on our days off. At some point I had to stop taking them. If I didn\u2019t answer, I usually got a follow up text that said \u201cyou suck\u201d or something along those lines.

I had to get the college councellor involved, it was a mess. I should have gone to the police, but hindsight is 20/20, that's how it went. He clearly had some major mental health issue and I was a na\u00efve 21yo who \"felt bad\" for him. When he finally moved away to study abroad, it didn't get any better because apparently I was still traumatized by it. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't focus, I had anxiety and even panic attacks.

It was a difficult lesson for me to learn as well in my own life. But it was an extremely valuable one, to both me and the friend that I ended up having to do this with. They and I now talk about our lives in much more fulfilling ways, and they've learned to ask me if I have the spoons to hear them vent - which now that it isn't a constant trauma dump all the time, I find I have much more emotional bandwidth to give. My establishing my boundaries also ended up helping them take a look at their own behavior and speak to their care team about different medications and increased therapy visits that made a huge difference in their life. \n\nBut it was very hard at first, especially since I knew it was going to upset them. It was a rough week for us both. But it very much paid off and I got to build a much deeper friendship with them and watch them get better and better with the added professional care.

People like this can absolutely drain you and it's so not good for you.\n\nMy coworker would start talking within a minute of me arriving at our desk area.

I could never get a word in edgewise, sometimes she'd block my desk so I couldn't even set my purse and water jug down, couldn't take my coat off. And it was every. fucking. morning.\n\nIt didn't matter that I'm not a morning person - \"Well, I am!! So you need to wake up!\". It didn't matter that I'm a quiet introvert and some days I was just more quiet than others - \"I'm your friend, you don't need to be shy with me!!\". It didn't matter that some days I had other stuff on my mind and I didn't want to engage in idle chatter - \"Are you mad at me? What did I do? You've got to tell me what I did because we have to work through this!!\". I would go home at the end of the day and have to sit quietly for 10-15 minutes to just process and recover. It was awful. \n\nSkipping over some other things, but she and I eventually had a meeting with our office manager. At that meeting, among other things being sorted out, I told her that I was not her friend, I did not want to discuss her husband, her kids, the things she reads on social media... I will discuss work stuff and that's it. Our manager (who knew the whole story) backed me up 100% and told her that she needed to respect her coworkers better and that not everyone wants to be her friend or handles situations like she does. It was a bit awkward after that, but it was also much better for my sanity.
