We will be in the middle of an at-home date night and then he vanishes to poop and I'm sitting there twiddling my thumbs. When we argue about it, he sometimes claims he has to sit there that long to \"get it all out\" and then when I tell him he needs to go to a doctor, he says well a lot of it is just playing on his phone (duh.) One time we were on vacation and the wifi didn't work in the bathroom, and his poops were only 10-20 minutes which by contrast was AMAZING. He refuses to try anything to limit his bathroom time - fiber, probiotics, seeing a doctor, changing his diet, setting a timer, etc.\n\nAnyway. This leads us to today. I'm currently pregnant and also have a badly sprained ankle so I'm hobbling around on either crutches or a rolling office chair.

Day 2 he had to work but I managed with the help of a friend coming over. He went out after work instead of coming straight home so I had to crawl down the stairs and across the room to let the dogs out which was difficult and painful. I let that go. This morning I wanted to let him sleep in because when he went to bed he mentioned he felt sleep deprived. Finally I hear him get up and I'm relieved because I need food, water, and the dogs need to go out. But guess what happens?!!?!?!? Yep, he heads to the bathroom. I text him that I need food and water and he says \"be there in a few\" but did not come down for an hour. By this point I had to give up on waiting for him because due to pregnancy, I was getting so hungry I was nauseous and I really could not wait. I had to drag my rolling chair down the stairs with me to the kitchen so I could take care of the dogs and myself.\n\nI'm so disappointed and feel so let down because no matter how many times I tell him his insistence on spending so much time in the bathroom is really inconvenient and frustrating, he does not care. I feel like I can't rely on him to take care of me, and I'm very concerned about when the baby comes - is he going to keep leaving me alone to care for the baby so he can play games in the bathroom?\n\nI don't know exactly what putting my foot down looks like, but I currently do not feel like talking to him and I honestly want to set some kind of boundary about his bathroom habits. I just can't take it anymore. WIBTA for giving him an ultimatum?

Definitely talk to him, but before you do, Google \u201cwhy do men take so long to poop?\u201d\n\nI mention this because I did that search because I thought my boyfriend was taking a long time (generally 10-20 mins) and was concerned for his health. Fun fact: sitting in the toilet for more than FIVE MINUTES can increase your risk of hemorrhoids so I was concerned lol. The results I found (which we\u2019re definitely written by a man, btw) were something about needing time to recharge because the oxytocin of being with your partner messes up testosterone or something like that. I\u2019m getting the details wrong for sure, so search for yourself, but it boils down to wanting time alone time. I think the biological explanation is a little much- obviously everyone wants and deserves alone time regardless of gender/sex/hormones.\n\nIt\u2019s totally reasonable to need some time alone. But it\u2019s not possible, practical, or fair to everyone else to take that time alone completely unscheduled and to use pooping as an excuse so others can\u2019t criticize or comment on it. You will BOTH need time alone to recharge once the baby comes. The only way for that to happen is by working together to plan it ahead of time. He needs to leave his phone out of the bathroom and instead schedule time regularly for him to be alone when you don\u2019t need him.\n\nSo yeah definitely talk to him.

And, frankly, if he\u2019s having to do it this often, then I\u2019d start wondering why. Is it possible that maybe he feels overwhelmed by spending all of his free time with you? As in, are there healthy boundaries established even within the relationship, so that each partner still has the ability to be their own person? \n\nYou cannot just get mad at him for doing stuff like this, but then not work to actively solve the overarching problem. This discussion about boundaries, and expectations, needs to happen quickly, as in before the baby comes. Because, once it is here, stuff will get even more stressful.

These are not the actions of a loving and caring partner OP. This man forced you to crawl down the stairs while injured and pregnant for gods sake!
