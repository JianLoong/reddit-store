And this happens 1-3 times EVERY SINGLE DAY. We are constantly late to everything because he procrastinates getting ready and then will not skip his long, luxurious pooping time. We will be in the middle of an at-home date night and then he vanishes to poop and I'm sitting there twiddling my thumbs. When we argue about it, he sometimes claims he has to sit there that long to \"get it all out\" and then when I tell him he needs to go to a doctor, he says well a lot of it is just playing on his phone (duh.) One time we were on vacation and the wifi didn't work in the bathroom, and his poops were only 10-20 minutes which by contrast was AMAZING. He refuses to try anything to limit his bathroom time - fiber, probiotics, seeing a doctor, changing his diet, setting a timer, etc.\n\nAnyway. This leads us to today. I'm currently pregnant and also have a badly sprained ankle so I'm hobbling around on either crutches or a rolling office chair. And our house has multi-stories so I'm mostly confined to the main level with the living room, bedroom, and bathroom. He did a great job of taking care of me on Day 1, I'll admit. Day 2 he had to work but I managed with the help of a friend coming over. He went out after work instead of coming straight home so I had to crawl down the stairs and across the room to let the dogs out which was difficult and painful. I let that go. This morning I wanted to let him sleep in because when he went to bed he mentioned he felt sleep deprived. Finally I hear him get up and I'm relieved because I need food, water, and the dogs need to go out. But guess what happens?!!?!?!? Yep, he heads to the bathroom. I text him that I need food and water and he says \"be there in a few\" but did not come down for an hour. By this point I had to give up on waiting for him because due to pregnancy, I was getting so hungry I was nauseous and I really could not wait. I had to drag my rolling chair down the stairs with me to the kitchen so I could take care of the dogs and myself.\n\nI'm so disappointed and feel so let down because no matter how many times I tell him his insistence on spending so much time in the bathroom is really inconvenient and frustrating, he does not care. I feel like I can't rely on him to take care of me, and I'm very concerned about when the baby comes - is he going to keep leaving me alone to care for the baby so he can play games in the bathroom?\n\nI don't know exactly what putting my foot down looks like, but I currently do not feel like talking to him and I honestly want to set some kind of boundary about his bathroom habits. I just can't take it anymore. WIBTA for giving him an ultimatum? FTR he does not have Chrohn's, Colitis, or anything like that.", "created_utc": 1683313381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138y2qa/wibta_for_putting_my_foot_down_about_my_husbands/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s using the bathroom as an excuse to be alone and get out of contributing towards the needs of the household. The fact he\u2019s doing it while you\u2019re injured, pregnant, and clearly struggling is absolutely sickening. He can\u2019t even show you the bare minimum amount of support when you need him most?\n\nYou need to tell him straight up that he is being lazy and uncooperative and needs to get his act together now. Not when the baby comes. **NOW**.\n\nHis actions are not the ones of a responsible adult and soon to be father. His are the actions of a moody teenager who leaves all of the chores to mom to handle while he goes upstairs to play games. It\u2019s not fair. He\u2019s a grown man and needs to act like one.", "NTA this reminds me of weaponized incompetence. He\u2019s buying his free time on the toilet rather than helping around the house or spending time with you or the other commitments you\u2019ve had to miss because of him. Also, is he bringing his phone in there? Sounds like he\u2019s taking about 2 hours per day to do absolutely nothing but play on his phone and be away from you. There\u2019s a deeper issue here.", "Idk about an ultimatum but could you compromise and ask him to stop taking his phone into the bathroom? Keep the focus on the task at hand? He can be on his phone in the living room while remaining available to help you when needed.", "NTA but this isn't about the bathroom, this is about you not having an active partner and facing that reality right before having a child with him", "Turn off the WiFi every time he goes to poop! NTA he\u2019s just avoiding life, and you.", "NTA. \n\nHe needs to see a doctor, just not the digestive tract type. He needs to see a therapist to get through his phone addition.

You should definitely put your foot down, now, before the baby comes. And before you injure yourself. What he's doing to you is dangerous!\n\nI think you should offer him three options: (1) Change now --today; (2) Marital counseling, or (3) You go home for the needed care and support until he can find a way to accept his responsibilities. If home isn't a possibility for you, there might be other possibilities, such as home nursing or even a hotel.", "NTA.  He's shirking responsibility to scroll the internet.", "NTA, and this will absolutely happen with the baby, but if you issue an ultimatum be ready to follow through. Ultimatums have to be real to be respectful or effective.", "NTA. \n\nLook, I get it. In an age where people are glued to their phones it\u2019s easy to get distracted in the bathroom while scrolling, it happens to most. But to *this* extent, especially when you\u2019re pregnant and it\u2019s so difficult for you to manage everything yourself, is just plain inconsiderate. \n\nThis isn\u2019t me offering a diagnosis for an easy out or anything \u2014 but Google \u201ctime blindness\u201d. It\u2019s a real thing and is a symptom of ADHD. Not that it absolves him of anything at all, but maybe it could be something to look into. \n\nOther than that, I think you\u2019ve offered every solution. He needs some kind of ultimatum, but *after* you\u2019ve explained to him everything  you\u2019ve told us. It\u2019s up to him what he does after that.", "This will only get worse when you add a child to the mix. NTA.

So, 2 adults, 1 bathroom. I swear, every time he went into the bathroom, he read \"War and Peace\" or \"The Lord of the Rings\"! It was a NIGHTMARE! When I told him to hurry up, he told me I could pee in the back yard!!! (Yes, he is my ex-husband)\n\nIt seriously sounds like this is not a medical issue, as demonstrated by his ability to go in 10 minutes when there is no internet. This is a control/avoidance behavior. He can avoid his responsibilities when he is in the bathroom, and he controls your access to the bathroom. \n\nThe boundary you can set: He cannot take his phone/tablet/book/magazine into the bathroom.", "Clearly NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know what the solution is. The 10 min when there was no WiFi situation shows this is a choice he is making. Perhaps show him this post as it is going to be universally NTA responses.", "NTA. I would be setting a no phone in the bathroom rule once the baby comes.", "NTA. \n\nIt's more than red flags at this point. His actions are incredibly inconsiderate. Do you want your child growing up with this man as their role model? \n\n\nYou deserve a partner who is present in your relationship. It sounds like you have already discussed this with your husband, and there's been no change. \n\n\nTis better to be alone than in bad company.", "NTA. Classic case of phone snubbing.\n\nHave you tried timing his toilet breaks? Like for example start a stopwatch everytime he goes to the toilet, and at the end of the day show him he spent 3 hours on the loo? Maybe he knows he spends a lot of time shitting, but might not realize how much. If you time it with a chronometer it's an irrefutable objective measurement and he can't run away from the truth.", "Can you turn the wifi off so he can't use it for too long?\n\nOr if you ask him to do something and he goes to the bathroom, after some time start texting and calling him non stop. \"I need your help and you've been in there 30 mins already, stop playing games and help your pregnant injured wife.\"\n\nOr book him a doctors appointment and tell him you did it because you're really concerned about his health?\n\nYou both need to sit down and sort this out. Make sure he knows exactly how his bathroom time is affecting you, especially while injured, and make sure he knows how it makes you feel, like your concerns when the baby comes.\n\nI want to say a little but Y.T.A because from what it sounds like here you've been enabling him by giving up and doing things yourself, but mostly NTA because no adult should need to spend that long in the bathroom unless they're really sick. He's admitted to mostly playing games, he needs to sort his priorities.", "Nta. Sitting on the toilet that much can lead to hemmeroids. If he needs that long on the toilet, something is def wrong.

Either you're exaggerating or you're married to a teenager. Me personally, my legs would go numb.\n\nOn the other hand, ultimatums are never going to work in anyone's favor and it's a pretty big stretch to say you feel like you can't rely on him. Taking care of a newborn is intimidating and the feeling to have your partner present is certainly warranted. Although he needs to grow up, you need to convey your concerns in an approach that promotes teamwork.

It's one thing to spend time now and again on your phone around your partner - but we noticed we were doing less talking and hanging out and more on our phones.  Phone addiction is a real thing.  \n\n\nSo, together, we bought a bunch silver, blue, and white Sculpy (that clay you can bake in the oven) and we made ourselves a little pretty \"phone box.\"  It was fun to create something together and now, for the most part, we keep our phones on loud but we mostly leave the phones in the box.  If we hear a notification, we go check it.  But for the most part, we don't touch them a ton while we're home.    \n\n\nIt has been AWESOME!  \n\n\nThat being said, I think you need to talk to your husband and tell him \"babe, I MISS you.  I get angry when you are spending upwards of 3 hours a day in the bathroom while I'm left to tend to the house, our unborn child, make sure you are fed and your clothes are clean... I feel like I'm doing everything.  And I also feel like if I were to disappear to the bathroom for three hours a day you'd be pretty upset with me.  One thing I've noticed is we both have gotten pretty reliant on our phones - would you be willing to try this experiment with me for a month where we keep our phones in the phone bowl during the day except when it's \"relax time\"?  I'm also super concerned about your intestinal health so I've already made a doctor's appointment for you to go get a colonscopy to check you out.\"    \n\n\nOk, maybe leave the colonscopy part out... but the rest of my suggestion stands.
