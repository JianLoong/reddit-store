This story centres around Jack.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of 19 until 23, Jack was in an on/off relationship with Grace. To put it mildly, Grace is a horrible person. Emotionally abusive, gaslighting, cheating, all them wonderful things and more. Unfortunately, Jack was wrapped around her finger, she would be her usual shitty self, Jack would leave her for a while, she\u2019d love bomb him and he\u2019d come back. Eventually, he came around after our mom passed and she was gleeful about it since the two didn\u2019t get along. It took some time and ignoring repeated contact but he moved on, to our delight. \r\n\r\nJack began dating Emily a little over three years ago, and she's honestly a beautiful person. I don\u2019t mean that as a physical descriptor, she\u2019s the most loving person you could meet.\r A year into their relationship, Emily was pregnant. Nine months later, their son Harry was born. He has since proposed to Emily, who accepted. He had it all.\r\n\r\nBut then ex contacts Jack, and drops a bombshell \u2013 she has it on good authority that Jack is not Harry\u2019s father. When Jack tells us we all laugh it off, telling him she just can\u2019t stand him being happy. This seemed to knock some sense into him, but only a week later he does a 180 and tells us he\u2019s going to tell Emily he wants a DNA test on Harry.\r\n\r\r\n\rBy Jack\u2019s own admission, Emily did not freak out, allowed Jack to make his case, and calmly told him that she would not stand in the way of a DNA test, but told him that if he goes through with it, when it comes back positive she will be handing back the engagement ring. I don't know if Jack thought she was bluffing or if he was swayed by the words of his ex, but he brought home a DNA testing kit and shock horror, it\u2019s a match. True to her word, Emily gives him back the ring, says they will sort custody amicably, and asks that he leave.\r\n\r\nJack was due to come to Christmas with Emily and Harry, turned up by himself, broke down in our dad\u2019s living room and told us what he\u2019d done. My dad put his hand on his shoulder, looked him in the eyes and said \u201cson, you\u2019re a fucking idiot\u201d and went back to the kitchen. Nobody spoke, until Jack asked if anyone had anything to say, and I just unloaded on him, told him he\u2019d fucked up the best thing he'd ever have all because of the word of an evil piece of shit, put a huge roadblock in front of us all seeing his son, and to top it all off ruined Christmas. Amanda and her boyfriend echoed this sentiment, though our other brother Tommy did come to his defence a bit. Because of all this, dinner was eaten in silence, no drinking games played or movies watched.\r\n\r\nIn the two days since, Jack has barely left his old bedroom, hasn\u2019t really spoken to anyone and the atmosphere at my dad\u2019s is grim. \rI feel bad for unloading on him knowing his history with his ex.

Hopefully that\u2019s enough to finally cut the cord with his ex for good.\n\nNo one is your family is TA for telling him like it is.

He needs to address the damage his ex did to him.  However, the family can reach out to Emily, offer to be there for your nephew in a way she is comfortable with.", "NTA.

He obviously already has a low opinion of himself and has for a while, otherwise he wouldn't have hooked up with Cruella in the first place and stayed so long. He just reinforced his own low self-opinion with this latest stunt. He needs some heavy-duty therapy for many reasons, and maybe he can slowly work his way back into Emily's good graces over time by demonstrating he's changed, not just saying the words. You and the rest of the family's support and love for Emily will go a long way towards having a relationship with the baby. Your support and love for Jack (along with your honesty) will help him, too. Good luck to all of you, what a bomb to have dropped on you all at Christmas.", "NTA. As harsh as all this may have sounded to him, he needed it. He needs a harsh awakening to get out of this toxic situation and turn his life around.

I don't know if Emily will ever give you another chance, but I DO know that you won't get another chance with her or with anyone else unless/until you are truly healed from the damage Grace caused you which appears to be a lot deeper than anyone realized, probably because it happened when you were still new to relationships and what you had with her is really all you knew of them. First you need to change your phone number - we need to remove every avenue Grace has to contact you in any way. You also need to strongly consider counseling because, again, you were in a toxic, honestly abusive, relationship at a young age and that causes damage that honestly needs a professional to truly heal. You're going to get through this, and you have my full support and the support of Dad and the other siblings. You also have Harry - you want to get into the best possible headspace to be the best father you can be to him.

Truth hurts but sometimes has to be done. he can hope that maybe Emily will forgive him and take him back 1 day or he has learned a valuable lesson for any future relationship.

I would not, probably, but then I am not such a lovely person as Emily.", "Give your brother gift certificates for therapy.", "NTA- but that relationship really made a damage on him. Instead of laughing at him or calling him names maybe you and your family should do something more productive to help him heal from that.", "NTA.

And i ask myself what happened in the few days that he made the 180 turn. How much contact did he had with his ex? \n\nInstead hiding in his room and piting himself, he should work on himself in therapy and find a way to be a great father to his child.", "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. \nYou are NTA", "NTA your brother ruined his own life, your told him the truth and he needs to deal with that.

He solicited your opinion, you gave him your honest opinion as requested The reason I wanted to call you an ass hole is because you don\u2019t kick people when they are down, especially family. But being family if your honest opinion is asked for, you should give it. You could\u2019ve been nicer but you were angry. \nNTA", "Soft YTA\n\nBy your own admission, your brother was in an abusive relationship. Breaking the psychological damage and co-defendant ties formed by emotional abuse, is not as easy as people may think. \n\nIn society, abuse (both physical and emotional) suffered by men is not taken as seriously as that which is suffered by women so I think maybe you and your family downplay and don\u2019t fully acknowledge how much damage your brother suffered at the hands of his ex. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like your brother was trying to make excuses for what he did or that he was looking for you guys to validate him - I think he just wanted comforting and encouragement from his family and instead of doing that, you guys just hurt him further. He already knew he was wrong and just needed some support. \n\nI wonder if you would have been has harsh if this was a female sibling of yours, who had gotten out of an abusive relationship but was still dealing with the traumatic effects of it and sabotaged a new relationship as a result? Would you have yelled at her as harshly? Would you have continued to make her feel like shit? \n\nYour brother messed up, but I think he knows that. He wasn\u2019t running away from that.

There was a few days between Emily asking Jack to leave and him turning up at Christmas. I haven't asked him where he was during that period, I sure hope he was at a friends.

And the cycle would repeat itself. \n\nWhen I say we sat back in watched it happen, I mean nothing we said or done got through to him. We had to watch him go through that abuse, and we could not get through to him.", "Damn straight, she handled it with far more grace than class than I ever would if a partner dared ask me such a rude question, just because his shitty ex goaded him. Jack deserves everything he got, which is nothing.", "I don't know if this will be a concern down the road, but is the ex the type to try and approach a child and tell THEM that \"Mommy isn't really your Mommy\" or \"Daddy isn't really your Daddy?\" This ex sounds unhinged, and I wonder if a restraining order would be a good idea for Jack. Because the way she works, I could see her upsetting a child for kicks."]}
