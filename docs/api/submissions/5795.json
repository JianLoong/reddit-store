This story centres around Jack.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of 19 until 23, Jack was in an on/off relationship with Grace. To put it mildly, Grace is a horrible person. Emotionally abusive, gaslighting, cheating, all them wonderful things and more. Unfortunately, Jack was wrapped around her finger, she would be her usual shitty self, Jack would leave her for a while, she\u2019d love bomb him and he\u2019d come back. Eventually, he came around after our mom passed and she was gleeful about it since the two didn\u2019t get along. It took some time and ignoring repeated contact but he moved on, to our delight. \r\n\r\nJack began dating Emily a little over three years ago, and she's honestly a beautiful person. I don\u2019t mean that as a physical descriptor, she\u2019s the most loving person you could meet.\r A year into their relationship, Emily was pregnant. Nine months later, their son Harry was born. He has since proposed to Emily, who accepted. He had it all.\r\n\r\nBut then ex contacts Jack, and drops a bombshell \u2013 she has it on good authority that Jack is not Harry\u2019s father. When Jack tells us we all laugh it off, telling him she just can\u2019t stand him being happy. This seemed to knock some sense into him, but only a week later he does a 180 and tells us he\u2019s going to tell Emily he wants a DNA test on Harry.\r\n\r\r\n\rBy Jack\u2019s own admission, Emily did not freak out, allowed Jack to make his case, and calmly told him that she would not stand in the way of a DNA test, but told him that if he goes through with it, when it comes back positive she will be handing back the engagement ring. I don't know if Jack thought she was bluffing or if he was swayed by the words of his ex, but he brought home a DNA testing kit and shock horror, it\u2019s a match. True to her word, Emily gives him back the ring, says they will sort custody amicably, and asks that he leave.\r\n\r\nJack was due to come to Christmas with Emily and Harry, turned up by himself, broke down in our dad\u2019s living room and told us what he\u2019d done. My dad put his hand on his shoulder, looked him in the eyes and said \u201cson, you\u2019re a fucking idiot\u201d and went back to the kitchen. Nobody spoke, until Jack asked if anyone had anything to say, and I just unloaded on him, told him he\u2019d fucked up the best thing he'd ever have all because of the word of an evil piece of shit, put a huge roadblock in front of us all seeing his son, and to top it all off ruined Christmas. Amanda and her boyfriend echoed this sentiment, though our other brother Tommy did come to his defence a bit. Because of all this, dinner was eaten in silence, no drinking games played or movies watched.\r\n\r\nIn the two days since, Jack has barely left his old bedroom, hasn\u2019t really spoken to anyone and the atmosphere at my dad\u2019s is grim. \rI feel bad for unloading on him knowing his history with his ex. AITA?\n\nEdit\n\nI had to cut a lot of what I'd like to have said due to word count, so to clear a few things up:\n\nThere's been a few comments justifying the request for a DNA test. Harry was conceived during covid in 2020, at the time both Jack and Emily were working from home, not socialising and doing literally everything together. It was literally impossible for anyone else to have impregnated her. I am aware his request is rooted in the abuse he suffered at the hands of his ex.\n\nOn the subject of abuse - a few comments have suggested we sat back and allowed Jack to be abused. I don't think anything in my original post indicated that, but to be clear, Jack being manipulated by her took a toll on us all, we didn't just let it happen. We would try to help him see her for what she is, and on the rare occasion we would get him to see sense, she would reel him back in. Unfortunately, convincing someone they are a victim of abuse, especially a man, can be an exercise in futility.\n\nRegarding therapy - when he had (seemingly) moved on from his ex once and for all, he done so with such conviction, laughing at her pathetic attempts to lovebomb him all over again, that at that point it didn't occur to us, naevity on our parts. Given what's now happened, as per suggestions we all agree this would be the best thing for him now.", "created_utc": 1672170209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwo4vp/aita_for_telling_my_brother_i_have_no_sympathy/", "score": 998, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Breaking the psychological damage and co-defendant ties formed by emotional abuse, is not as easy as people may think. \n\nIn society, abuse (both physical and emotional) suffered by men is not taken as seriously as that which is suffered by women so I think maybe you and your family downplay and don\u2019t fully acknowledge how much damage your brother suffered at the hands of his ex. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like your brother was trying to make excuses for what he did or that he was looking for you guys to validate him - I think he just wanted comforting and encouragement from his family and instead of doing that, you guys just hurt him further. He already knew he was wrong and just needed some support. \n\nI wonder if you would have been has harsh if this was a female sibling of yours, who had gotten out of an abusive relationship but was still dealing with the traumatic effects of it and sabotaged a new relationship as a result? Would you have yelled at her as harshly? Would you have continued to make her feel like shit? \n\nYour brother messed up, but I think he knows that. He wasn\u2019t running away from that.

It sounds like Jack formed a trauma bond with Grace due to the toxic and frankly abusive relationship. He needs therapy. He fucked up by trying to move on without healing, that's for sure. The whole 'sabotaging the new relationship ' move is a classic narcissistic abuser power move to leave him vulnerable and try to bring him back. You were right in what you said, but Jack's going to need therapy and support to heal and stay away from Grace. Only when he's done that would he be in a position to re-enter a relationship with Emily. What a painful and cruel situation for all involved.

ESH As a woman we never have to wonder if we are growing attached to a child that may one day be ripped away from us with the words \"he/she isn't even your kid.\" I would never begrudge my husband a DNA test. If I didn't know 100% sure I was the mother to my kids, I'd want to know before putting so much in to my kids emotionally for fear of one day having them ripped from me once I'm already deeply involved in their lives. So I think it was an asshole move for his fianc\u00e9 to leave him for wanting a DNA test. And he was supposed to believe the kid was his just because she said it was? There are too many men who raise kids who aren't theirs for years just to have the mother get pissed one day, tell him the child is not his, leave with the kid, he fights for custody/visitation, DNA comes back he is not the father, and he never sees this child he loves like his own. That is a pain I can only imagine. Just imagining finding out my kids aren't mine and ill never see them again breaks my heart. That is not a pain I'd want to inflict on anyone or that I'd want anyone to inflict on someone I care about. Clearly she didn't, but there was no way to know that for certain without a DNA test. The abusive ex was an asshole because she did this with the obvious agenda of ending your brother's happy relationship. Then, Jack brings his feelings to his family and gets y'all's response. This may be an unpopular opinion, but everyone except Jack is an asshole in this story. My heart goes out to him.", "My guess is Emily left cause she realized Jack still isnt over or is just really easily manipulated by his ex and doesnt want to deal with her if she stayed with Jack.", "Lol at leaving somebody because they verify the DNA of their child.

And while I'm not saying you're doing this, going off on him just for going off on him isn't helpful or necessarily fair... that would be like blaming women for staying in abusive relationships with men who abuse them. It is complicated. He needs therapy NOW, to heal himself and break some deeply ingrained cycles. Good that you're considering it, and I hope that this situation will give him the push go through with it.\n\nIf and when he's done the hard work--and make no mistake, it is hard work--of healing himself, then he can think through his future relationship with Emily. \n\nI hope all of you can find healing, and that the new baby can have a healthy upbringing surrounded by loving family.", "NTA\n\nYour brother ignored all the warnings.", "NTA.

Obviously when she went to check his phones photo folders to look at her pregnancy pictures she knew he had an album for, she saw nudes of her old friends. Obviously she decides she\u2019s done for good but still wants her daughter to have a relationship with him. About 2 or 3 months go by and he finally figured out that she\u2019d meant it and says \u201cif I can\u2019t have you then I don\u2019t want her\u201d. And promptly exits their lives. At that point she was getting to know a guy and they started dating shortly after. He was the BEST father to that baby and they family would find things like wedding magazines hidden under her bed and pages of engagement rings pulled up on her browser. Just at 4 years into the relationship and ex contacts her again saying it was a mistake to be out of his kids life like that so he starts doing the 5 hour drive to come see the kid. Something that was obvious to the family then and is obvious to her in hindsight was that he didn\u2019t actually care about seeing his kid. His mom wanted to see her granddaughter and that gave him an idea and an opening. She ends up ending things with her boyfriend. Immediately gets pregnant again by the ex. She swears it was an accident but I overheard a conversation of hers and the fathers that says otherwise. But her 3rd is only 11 months younger than the 2nd kid. She finally ends up breaking up with the guy (abusive. Emotionally,physically,and sexually. Thankfully he was never like that with the girls. But he would do dumb things like drive around dealing coke with them in the car). But not long after she gets with a single dad to a girl the same age as her younger two. He also turns out to be physically abusive and just an all around lying sleazeball. He left her after 2 years for some reason that I can\u2019t remember but he made some very demeaning remarks about her that she hopefully doesn\u2019t let him come back from. They all related to how fat he found her and ugly and some worse things in relation to those comments. It was recent enough that according to my grandmother she\u2019s partially thinking about taking him back. But if you ask that cousin she\u2019ll always say that leaving that guy was the worst mistake of her life and it\u2019s honestly made her kind of bitter toward the world. She\u2019s not quite the same person. Much more angry than she used to be. \nTLDR: he will always regret this even if he does have better luck than my cousin did after \u201cthe one that got away\u201d.
