Sounds like everyone but the cousin is on board for the theme, so if she is going to cause drama over not liking it removing her from the bridal party is a logical and reasonable course of action.

NTA, though.", "NTA. Also - way to go, standing up for your sister like that. And it's awesome the way your sister bought in so completely and found a way to have fun with you.

She was supposed to just watch or share the positive emotions from that moment, it could have been beautiful for everyone, but she decided to ruin it by disrespecting your sister. \n\nYou actually did the right thing.

Your wedding , your rules.", "NTA- your sister is a treasure", "NTA!  More likely Jen was being petty and jealous since you had such a wonderful reaction to your sisters outfit and the effort she put in.  Maybe make your cousin the villain since she showed she had a black poisonous heart?   \n\nBtw:  I love Sailor Moon!  Mercury and Saturn are my faves.  I just want to give your sister a hug!  May", "Sounds like your cousin is jealous of your sister for making you genuinely happy. Your sister is doing everything right. That's what MOH's are supposed to do, step up and take the reigns so the bride enjoys the wedding and isn't stressed. Your cousin is making you stressed and if your cousin and aunt have an issue with how you want your wedding to go they both don't have to come", "NTA and I agree with mostly everyone else: this isn\u2019t over the anime itself, this is about Jen not respecting how much effort Kylie has put into honouring your wedding and making your dreams come true. Kylie is such a VIP and doesn\u2019t deserve to be made to feel like this by Jen after going all-in over something that was never her interest. It\u2019s also awesome that Dan saw and thought of a neat way to include an anime touch on the groom\u2019s side. Ties everything together without being over the top. Jen just doesn\u2019t understand that weddings are supposed to be fun and that growing up doesn\u2019t have to mean letting go of the things that make us happy. \n\n(Also, I love your wedding theme including anime touches. Super cool.)", "nta, can i go in her place? :D", "NTA 100%\n\nNot much more to add except that as a Sailor Moon fan, I loved hearing about your wedding!  Wish I could see it!", "Agree, NTA. To be clear, I know nothing about anime and I\u2019d probably feel uncomfortable with this whole thing, but I was also uncomfortable when I had to buy a designer bridesmaid dress for like $500 (to this day the most expensive thing I own, 10 years later), but I did it anyway because a) we could all afford it, it wasn\u2019t a big deal and b) it wasn\u2019t about me! My friend had a vision for a wedding, she loves me enough to have me in her wedding, and why make a big deal about something that\u2019s not hurting anyone??", "Lol so did i", "I really want to see the sisters dress too. It really all does sound fun and like the little sister tried her hardest for her sister.", "NTA this isn\u2019t about the anime, it\u2019s about Jen\u2019s disgusting behavior towards Kylie. she deserves to be removed from the wedding for the way she behaved, so jealous.", "What does MOH and FMA stand for?", "NTA, but you\u2019re framing the incident oddly. Understanding this will help the others involved and the rest of your family understand the point. You're not upset about anime or cartoons, you are upset about the disrespect and rudeness your cousin is directing at your little sister. She repeatedly and harshly insulted your sister and that is the reason for the consequences. Make sure to continue to express that the cartoon and the details are ultimately irrelevant to the point that your sister put work into a thoughtful gesture, and deserves respect. If you want to be the bigger person and make peace, maybe offer to let her back in if she apologizes to your sister and changes her attitude. But obviously only if you are going to be comfortable with it.", "NTA.\n\nIf your aunts bring this up again, cut them off. \u201cJenn made fun of my *wedding theme* and made my sister cry she was being so obnoxious about it. If she can\u2019t act right at a dress try-on, I doubt she can behave at an actual wedding.\u201d", "NTA\n\nEver notice how when someone's jealous about something they come up with the most asinine arguments that really just overtly demonstrate them grasping at straws? Your cousin said a whole lot of obvious horse shit, and demonstrated her absolute lack of humility, grace and most of all maturity, in spite of being nearly 30. It's mighty bold she'd invoke Kylie's maturity at nearly 20 when your cousin was throwing an actual public tantrum.\n\nAlso, this wasn't \"over a cartoon\" it was over how it meant to have someone go above and beyond for you in spite of not even liking that \"cartoon\" and then having that effort dumped on because of some petty childish jealousy.", "NTA. Jen should have kept quiet though if she had nothing nice to say. Bullying someone ten years younger. You didn't get upset over cartoon's but because she was being a major asshole to your younger sister. I think it's pretty cringe having an anime theme wedding. I'm getting second hand embarrassment from reading this. I would never tell off or belittle someone for it.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nNo. This isn't \"about cartoons\". It's about the downright hostility and disrespect.  Your aunt's are just enabling her. I'd tell them that they're welcome to throw their own wedding and simply not attend. \n\nJen is jealous that you're getting married and the theme isn't something she likes, so she's beginning to lash out.\n\nSounds like she's an undercover narcissist and the mask is starting to slip since this isn't the \"wedding she envisioned\" \ud83d\ude44.\n\nShe isn't mad at Kylie. She's mad it isn't *her* wedding.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all I am a HUGE Sailor Moon nerd (and also big on FMA) and this sounds like such a cool theme to go with and that's so awesome that your sister has gone all out for it to make it extra special for you!!\n\nYour cousin is being so nasty over something that should not be an issue at all. Idk if she wanted to be MOH and felt slighted or something or what, but she was way out of line to talk like that to your sister and then to go crying to her mum about the consequences of her actions.\n\nYou're doing the right thing, keep it up and enjoy your wedding!", "NTA but you two have some seriously basic taste in anime.", "NTA and if you need a replacement adopted cousin I volunteer in the name of the moon", "NTA; she absolutely deserved to be kicked out", "I\u2019d love to see the dresses especially the maid of honor dress!!! Sailor moon is awesome and I love the clothing from it!!! Also ur NTA u were standing up for ur sister!! Congrats on ur wedding I hope it lasts forever!!!", "Clickbait titles are a time honoured tradition in this sub!", "Yeah, but Anime is the cover family is using to minimise Jen's shitty behaviour and make OP second guess yourself.\n\nStay strong OP. Don't let them make this about 'a silly cartoon'. Jen's kicked out because she made your sister cry\n\nNTA", ">Jen has a crappy attitude and attacked Kylie for no reason at all.\n\nIt wasn't \"for no reason at all\", it was because Kylie looked beautiful and Jen couldn't have that.", "yeah why does Jen care that Dan got into making the groomsman things FMA related because Kylie made sure all the bridesmaid stuff all Sailor Moon related??? It sounds like Jen has a thing for Dan and now is mad jealous that Kylie has either inspired or spending more time with the entire bridal party to make it special? Why does he matter when like the whole thing is about how Kylie is making this special for OP??\n\nit\u2019s not about anime at all, Jen is being childish & entitled she\u2019s not getting the same attention even tho she\u2019s the eldest of all the people named.

Never heard of FMA.", "NTA\n\nYou're not upset about an anime (I absolutely adore Sailor Moon and I love the theme for you wedding!) you're upset because she was being incredibly disrespectful to your sister.\n\nWho btw wins at being an amazing sister by going all out for your wedding despite not liking the show.", "NTA", "NTA and what a sweet relationship you have with your sis!", "Not gonna lie, I didn't understand half of what your post is talking about, but I think I understood the most relevant part, which is your sister was being disrespected for going the extra mile for you. NTA.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for standing up for your sister. Your wedding sounds really cool. \n\nCould we please see pictures of the dress?!", "NTA.\n\nIf this were literally any other theme or design it would not matter.

Your sister went above and beyond her own preferences to make your special day extra special and your cousin couldn't respect that. If anything I think you were too nice, I'd have disinvited Jen right away.\n\nPS: I would love to see pics of the wedding, I love Sailor Moon and FMA!", "NTA. Jen is an major AH for bullying your sis. I would have uninvited her from my wedding and anyone who supported her. BTW Your wedding is going to be awesome since I'm an anime fan.", "NTA Jen is jealous - either because kylie looks so good in the dress or because she has pulled out all the stops and you\u2019re so grateful (and not as impressed with Jen). Perhaps there is something else going on with Jen. Maybe she was expecting kylie to fail you and that you\u2019d ask her to step up and be MOH. Maybe because she actually likes SM and feels her \u2018fandom\u2019 is being appropriated. I don\u2019t know. Whatever it is she doesn\u2019t deserve her place in the bridal party any more. I hope she can get over herself, apologise and come to what sounds like a fun wedding", "NTA, it sounds like your cousin is jealous (my best guesses being; your sister being MOH or your getting married, or like your fiance) and is using anime as an excuse to lash out. Jen is completely in the wrong and is acting more like a child then the actual teenager.", "Cousin even did a two for two, in attacking the sister she simultaneously attacked the theme of the wedding and this the bride herself. \n\nNTA, cousin can pretend to be grown up at home while you all have fun at the wedding OP."]}
