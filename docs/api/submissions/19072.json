My sister (19F) \u201cKylie\u201d is my MOH. \u201cDan\u201d (27M) is Ken\u2019s Best Man. My cousin (29F) \u201cJen\u201d was one of my other Bridesmaids.\n\nFor my Bridal Party, I decided to let everyone pick their color for their dresses based off the colors of the Sailor Guardians from Sailor Moon. Everyone thought it was fun, but Kylie, who genuinely dislikes Sailor Moon, surprised me by finding a Sailor Mercury bridesmaid dress based off a wedding scene in the original anime and had it remade. She has been so extra for me and it\u2019s meant a lot. At every event, she\u2019s worn something Ami wore, or at least close. She even helped me find these cute flower holders for all the Bridesmaids to hold their flowers in that look like the transformation pens. Dan saw and thought having FMA stuff for Ken and the Groomsmen.\n\nEveryone was having fun with it. Ken and I were super happy. Last week, my sister\u2019s MOH dress finally came in and I literally started crying. She looked GORGEOUS in it, and knowing she put all this effort into finding it and getting it made over a show she doesn\u2019t even like meant a lot to me. For some reason, this set Jen off. She started saying that Kylie shouldn\u2019t be MOH because she\u2019s a teenager and \u201cobviously too childish\u201d. She started then saying that Kylie \u201cbrainwashed\u201d Dan into doing all this anime stuff for Ken. Everyone got really quiet and uncomfortable. Kylie almost started crying and asked me if I didn\u2019t like the dress or what she has done for the wedding so far. I assured her that I loved it and asked Jen to step outside. After a fight where she kept being ugly about Kylie, I kicked her out of the Bridal Party and told her that if she didn\u2019t stop she would be uninvited from the wedding. She left but my aunts have been calling me unreasonable for getting upset \u201cover cartoons\u201d. My mom is on my side but thinks maybe I could have been gentler.\n\nAm I TA? She was ugly to my sister so to me it\u2019s over more than the shows.\n\nTDLR: My sister went full nerd for me as my MOH and designed everything for me to be Sailor Moon and helped my fianc\u00e9s Best Man design all his stuff to be FMA Brotherhood. My cousin started mocking everything she\u2019s done and I got fed up, kicked her out of my Bridal Party and might end up banning her from the wedding.", "created_utc": 1685997174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141qvbe/aita_for_kicking_my_cousin_out_of_my_wedding_over/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's your sister, there should be no arguments from anyone about you choosing her for your MOH.  Jen just sounds like she's jealous that Kylie did something so cool.\n\nStand your ground.

Uninvite Jen from your wedding and uninvite your aunt too if she keeps harassing you", "NTA\n\nIts your wedding and your sister was going all out for you to make it perfect. I commend someone so young being able to give you exactly what you want, even though its not her preference. The cousin was acting like the spoiled teenager instead.", "NTA. The members of your family who look at this situation and blame \"cartoons\" are not seeing what is really happening. You removed Jen from the bridal party for bullying your MOH, not because of anime.", "NTA. Your cousin was being horribly mean to your sister, who is 10 years her junior. It is confusing how Dan comes into the picture though. Did she feel left out because others in the wedding party were doing more anime stuff? Was she hoping to get together with Dan and thought your sister was getting too much attention?", "NTA\n\nTitle\u2019s a bit misleading though. You didn\u2019t kick Jen out of the wedding over an anime. You kicked her out because she was being needlessly mean to you and Kylie. Good riddance.", "NTA. I wouldn't say this is \"over an anime\" at all. Somebody bullied your sister and you told them to GTFO. Seems pretty clear cut to me. Good on you for defending your sister!\n\nJen seems to completely misunderstand where you're coming from. She's not taking responsibility for her hurtful actions.", "What version od Sailor moon does she dislike (the 90's or the 20's) and why?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Anyone who call someone names unprovoked like that is not worth having around. The context is not relevant. You absolutely did the right thing! Thank you for sticking up for Kylie. All of us who were bullied in our teen years (or whenever) thank you for being the person you are.", "NTA. But your cousin \u201cJen\u201d was TA.", "NTA but good on you for standing up for your sister!", "NTA. \n\nIT's YOUR wedding.  What's Jen's problem?  She might hate the dress, but who cares?  YOU love it, Kylie likes it.  That's all that matters.", "NTA, you and your husband (and others) wanted it at your wedding and that's that. Jens opinion is irrelevant here. \n\nBy fmab stuff, do you mean something like the military outfits for the groomsmen? \n\nAnd congratulations.", "NTA \n\nYour not reacting over ainme your reacting over someone being shitty to little sister. As you should.", "NTA but this comes off like Jen has the hots for Dan and wanted to show herself off as the more intelligent mature woman in the bridal party by putting your sister down.", "NTA,\n\nYour sister rocks btw. You did nothing wrong , honestly surprised you didn\u2019t straight up revoke her wedding invitation. I don\u2019t understand how some think they can treat others that way", "NTA\n\nLet's be very real here, you're not upset about anime or cartoons, you are upset about the disrespectful attitude Jen is showing Kylie. She has insulted your sister and that is the reason she's removed.", "NTA\n\nThat's your wedding and your cousin was causing trouble, you had every right to kick her out. Your aunts defending her don't understand that it's not \"being upset over a cartoon\", it's the amount of disrespect your cousin showed to you and everyone involved. \n\nCongrats on the engagement and having a sailor moon themed wedding honestly sounds amazing.", "Kylie went over the top for you, working hard to enhance the joy of your wedding. That's being a great friend. Then Jen got petty and tried to tear it all down. Unless Jen can reign herself in, you're better off without her in the party (and potentially the wedding). NTA.", "NTA\n\nRe: your mom, why do you have to be gentler to someone like Jen? That\u2019s probably why Jen (and your aunt) are acting so entitled. Everyone is so scared to supposedly rock the boat, when Jen and her mom are the boat rockers. Throw them overboard!", "you didn't kick her out over animal. you kicked her out for being a prissy, jealous ah and disrespecting your sister, you. your fiance, and ALSO a thing you love enough to make it the theme of your frigging wedding.\n\n\nit's so, so, SO not about the cartoon. NTA", "NTA \n\nYou're not \"getting upset over cartoons\" you're getting upset over someone trash talking your baby sister. You're not \"kicking your cousin out over an anime\" you're kicking her out for being an asshole for no reason other than apparent childish jealousy.", "NTA.  Sounds like everyone but the cousin is on board for the theme, so if she is going to cause drama over not liking it removing her from the bridal party is a logical and reasonable course of action.  Maybe she thinks the idea is childish or maybe she's jealous not getting as much attention, but either way she needs to go.  I'd make sure she has a chaperone with 100% loyalty to OP if she is invited to the big event.", "NTA\n\nThis really has nothing to do with cartoons. The theme/style of the wedding could have been anything, and the actual issue is that Jen has a crappy attitude and attacked Kylie for no reason at all.", "NTA    it's not her place to decide, or criticize, what anyone in your bridal party wears.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re upset about sailor moon - it sounds like you\u2019re very reasonably upset because your jealous (or just spiteful) cousin bullied your little sister (who is a young adult but is also a teen and a full decade younger than the person being mean to her), and then turned on your fianc\u00e9 and his best friend.", "First congratulations for the wedding wish you both a very happy,long , rich, and full of love life together.\n\nSecond NTA as big as your cousin stupidness. \n\nThird good on you for stepping up for your sister. Big sisters rule", "NTA \n\nYour cousin was mean to your sister AND about your theme. I would love to hear more about the FMA Brotherhood costumes. That is an amazing series.", "NTA - Not sure why Jen thinks she has any say at all in YOUR wedding. It's wonderful that your family (jen excluded) is so happy to support the Sailor Moon theme. Jen sounds rude and entitled.", "No, you are picking your little sister over your cousin. Your cousin is obviously jealous of lil sis and her \u201cgorgeous\u201dappearance and adherence to a \u201ccartoon\u201d that cousin obviously thinks is frankly juvenile.\n\nExcept that you, the bride, have made  that \u201cchildish cartoon\u201d the whole theme of your wedding! And your cousin just shit on your wedding. Well, ya know what? The theme and the dresses and the position of MOH-it\u2019s not her decision to make!\n\nOh, hell, no. Out she goes .
