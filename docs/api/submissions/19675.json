They both want to destress in different ways. That would definitely be exhausting to \u2018take your work home.\u2019 Maybe allocate a short time for shop talk (ie 30 mins) and then agree with no more for the night and talk about something else positive going on in your lives.", "NTA.  I get it, my husband used to do the same thing all the time, and I worked a stressful job that I really needed to decompress from when I\u2019d get home.  We agreed that we would not talk at length about things when we first get home, we would hug and \u201cI missed you\u201d and then do our own thing for a bit, then later hang out together and talk about our day.  It worked beautifully.  Maybe there\u2019s a good compromise to be found?", "NTA. I feel like people are missing the fact that he's not just saying \"I had a difficult surgery today\" and explaining briefly why. He's going into minute details. And you also work in the OR. Do YOU get to destress at the end of the day?\nMaybe you can compromise by telling him that of course he's allowed to talk about his day but it needs to be broad strokes or he needs to wait until the baby is in bed or something.", "ESH - Hear me out.\n\nYou suck because he obviously needs to share his day with you. It's a pretty common aspect in many relationships. You're *not* supporting him in this, and it's understandable why he feels like he can't talk to you. It blows to have the one person you want to talk to the most tell you over and over again they don't want to listen to what you have to say.\n\nHe sucks because you've articulated how much and why this frustrates you, and he's not taking you into consideration when he continues to do so. You're setting a boundary and he's not being receptive. So he's *also* not being supportive of *you* in this.\n\nIt sounds like a compromise is the best solution here. He can still talk about his day, but not in so much detail and not for longer than a determined amount of time. He could even ask you if you'd be up for him talking about it. If he begins to go deeper into detail to a point that it's bothersome for you, have a codeword ready that can neutrally remind him to keep shop talk to a minimum. This way, you are still supporting him and listening to him, but he's also respecting your boundary of not wanting to feel like you're back at work.\n\nIt can be difficult when partners are on opposite sides of a situation like this, but as long as both of you actively practice patience, clear communication, boundary setting/respecting, and the understanding that sometimes even the best-laid plans have hiccups, it'll work out.", "NAH.\n\nPeople need to de-stress after their days. It looks different for different people, and when you throw caring for young children into the mix, it can be very frustrating.\n\nIf his way of de-stressing is to verbally vent his frustrations about work, maybe discuss ways you can be present for him for a specified time (5-10 minutes?) while you both do some of the housework and childcare activities together. \n\nSometimes, taking a walk on a pre-planned route can give routine time limits to the post-work spewing while getting you all out of the house and giving him some dedicated time to talk about his day. Exercise on his own immediately after work can give him more of a transition time to physically vent frustration as well. \n\nYou might discuss with him that the extreme details are tedious for you, and while they're relevant for him, they're not as important for you to be able to understand his day. Ask him if he can condense the specifics to something that would make sense to a layperson when explained quickly (even though you DO understand the details). For some people, on the other hand, talking out the details can be a way to verbally process and identify specific emotions and sources of frustration, so you might ask him if that's what he's doing and have him really think about his answer.\n\nIf he's not in therapy, seeing a therapist would give him another person to help him mindfully communicate with you and better identify what he needs when he comes home from work. Likewise, if you're seeing a therapist, ask them for suggestions on how to honor your boundaries while still meeting his needs and your child's needs.  \n\nAsking if he wants to vent, wants advice, or wants support can be really useful as well because it dictates what he wants from you during the exchange.", "NTA. Your husband is not respecting your time or comfort level. It would be one thing if he wanted to check in with you and vent a little that it was a rough day. But you are not obligated by your wedding vows to listen to him exhaustively narrate every gory detail of a medical case. If he were a supportive husband he would not be stressing you out like this. He needs to find a therapist he can talk to and not dump this on you.", "NTA. 100% understand having boundaries about bringing work stuff home. If you\u2019re at this point I imagine it\u2019s been pervasive and relentless and you\u2019ve bought it up before which has been ignored many times. \n\nEncourage him to get a work crew for social support/debriefing. Or set timers where you both concisely summarise your day and have a conversation not about work.", "NTA\n\nYou need to decompress at the end of the day. For you that means not talking about work. I get that. \n\nIf he occasionally spoke about something special, that would be different. But it sounds like he\u2019s just dumping his entire day on you every evening. That\u2019s a lot.", "NTA.  You and your husband both work. He's marginalizing your job and your parental contributions.  If it were a two sided conversation it would be different,  but it sounds like he's monopolizing the conversation.  \n\nYou have every right to be able to destress after work and child care. Hopefully,  he is taking responsibility for your child too. \n\nSuggest he tell your child about his day while you relax with a glass of wine or agree on a list of topics for a post work chat like the weather or your time off plans or your child.", "NTA.   It's OK to occasionally want sympathy from one's partner if you had a particularly rough day, but there's still no need for a detailed play by play.\n\nIf he wanted support, he's be talking about his feelings or stressors about the day (or part of it) in general, not just spouting off a step by step recreation of his entire shift, which is usually something people do when they simply A) don't know any better or B) are looking for validation.

I do have a grandson who liked to relate everything right after a big experience\u2014such as when he built his own  computer, and later, first time he co-flew a plane, or he was at a really good conference and had a lot to think about\u2014things like that.  He always thanked me for listening and once explained that if he could talk to someone right after an important experience, he would then be able to retain it. It was almost as if he were recording himself\u2014so it sounded very rote, and whoever was on the listening end would kind of be thinking, do I need to be here for this, but in fact, what cemented his memory was having a person listen. I had all the time in the world so it was fine with me. He still does this with his mother now and then. It will be midnight and she is dying to go to sleep but she doesn't see him often, or hear from him often, so he asks if she has time to hear what he is thinking about and she says yes and just listens. Again, NTA here, you need a break right when your husband needs to talk, and that's something that you will have  to figure out\u2014but I would not have listened to my husband at that time of day either. The dynamic between partners has to be more equal, especially when you are raising little kids and working.", "YTA. put yourself in his shoes. imagine you had a stressful day and you wanted to tell your husband a story about work and he practically told you to shut up. some people's way to destress is to talk about things that may have stressed them throughout the day. maybe your husband is like that", "YTA.

Then, I bet OP would be a lot less stressed listening because OP is not being pulled in 2 very different mental directions.", "Oh no I'm the one talking about my excel SS about home. Thus must be how my husband feels. Little bit of a home truth for me there lol.", "Gosh I hope not. Or else I need to avoid this hospital", "What the hell? If he leaves/cheats he\u2019s definitely the problem", "Then she can take him to the cleaners while she supports their one year old child? She created a simple boundary and he\u2019s overstepping. She wants work to stay at work, and he wants to continuously talk her ear off while she tries to raise a an infant.", "She is mentally checked out from raising the kid it\u2019s not that she\u2019s not caring it\u2019s that she\u2019s tired", "You have a serious reading comprehension problem. She doesn't want to hear gory, upsetting medical details at length, when she is exhausted for being a mother all day. It should be obvious why that would be stressful. It's great that you are willing to hear lengthy details but that is hardly a spousal obligation. One should also respect your spouses boundaries and reasonable limits.", "My husband and I do as well but if we both had a stressful day we aren\u2019t going to walk up on each other and stress dump non stop for 30+ minutes.", "Kiddo will also probably have an extensive vocabulary very young!", "This is one of the BEST answers I\u2019ve ever seen on AITA. A one year old doesn\u2019t care what words are coming out of your mouth as long as you have a smile on your face and a smile in your voice. Dad can tell the son all about his day. He can get as technical as he wants\u2026kid doesn\u2019t care! So the dad gets to de-stress, baby gets time with dad, mom can de-stress from her day.", "I wonder if Mom could even be present for the shop talk while Dad is handling the kid and talking about shop. Would the shop talk be a lot less stressful, if it wasn't putting Mom's brain on double duty of \"taking care of kid\" and \"medical stuff I do for work\" at the same time. I.e. a bit of cognitive overload. If Dad wants to talk shop, he should probably take on the extra cognitive load.", "Plus it will build the toddler's vocabulary skills!", "Taking care of a child is a little bit more involved than \u201chousework.\u201d", "Clearly if a man has 30 minutes to talk about his day he's neglecting his responsibilities at home. Such a huge red flag. OP should reconsider her relationship with such a selfish person. /s", "People die in hospitals ALL THE TIME! Like... Many it's a daily occurrence.   \n\n\nIt's a reality of the medical field.", ">She doesn't want to hear gory, upsetting medical details at length, when she is exhausted for being a mother all day.\n\nOP is also a medical professional, works in an OR, and is not a SAHM. But sure, my reading comprehension is the issue.\n\n>One should also respect your spouses boundaries and reasonable limits.\n\nThat should go both ways. Husband should be allowed to talk about his day at work. Why, according to you, does only one spouse get to set boundaries and limits?", "Idk why it matters anyway, people need to stop devaluing childcare when it\u2019s more exhausting than most work is", "Except the kid doesn\u2019t care. The man obviously wants to tell someone who cares. Otherwise he could just say it to a wall.", "In my experience, cooking and cleaning are pretty critical tasks in childcare.", "It's an absolute fucking marvel that any of these people on reddit have ever been in a relationship with another human being. Oh? Someone falls short somewhere sometimes? Red flag. Divorce immediately.", "Yes. I get it. That was a joke about the death being \"routine\" or too often.", "Because it serves their narrative of him being an asshole. I 100% agree with you. I would be floored if my SO just up and told me I\u2019m not allowed to talk about my day and be as descriptive as I want to be. I\u2019d probably just turn off emotionally and just give the standard \u201cit was fine\u201d after that. I don\u2019t understand couples when they describe issues like these. Did you two not talk about about anything prior to your marriage? How is this a new thing? I want to hear all the details about my spouses day, and they should be willing to listen to mine. It\u2019s communication, that\u2019s how couples strength emotional bonds, and by shutting him down from talking about his day.. If you ever separate from each other (god forbid), please reference this as one of the primary reasons where it all started to go wrong.", "Then OP needs to hand him a quarter \ud83d\ude02. Sorry, Travis Tritt song popped in my head as soon as I read your reply. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "His wife doesn't care either.  At least he won't be pissing the kid off with it", "Blows my mind how people take OP saying he takes over a half hour ONCE A WEEK and question why in that very brief moment of time he's not stepping in to take over the childcare responsibilities. Like we know nothing of these peoples lives lol. He could have just gotten off a 12hr shift while she had a day off the OR (yes child care is huge responsibility and exhausting but it's not literally being in surgery for hours). we don't know, we're not there.", "It may be a joke, but that\u2019s how a lot of affairs start. This person listened. This person was interested in me. This person cared. Etc. I\u2019m not saying OPs feelings and thoughts on the matter aren\u2019t relevant, they are, but the husband obviously wants his wife to know about his day. Not saying he\u2019s going to wind up at the Hilton with the intern over it, but small things matter.", "Maybe he wants to tell someone who *understands*, rather than cares. What if the alternative was for him to go out for a drink with a medical colleague after work where they could talk shop before he comes home to his wife. His problem is solved, but would she like that any better? Probably not.", "She should care to the extent that it\u2019s important to her husband. He\u2019s right to feel unsupported.", "Sure, there's no reason to assume he's the antichrist.\n\n\nBUT HE FUCKING MIGHT BE.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying but why does he have to go into such detail. I\u2019m a retired nurse. Maybe they can agree that he can talk about ONE of his most interesting cases he had that day. Not all of them!", "Maybe he should try helping out with their kid instead of expecting her to do the work and listen to his information dump?", "Why do his needs supersede hers?", "Their needs are supposed to be equal. He wants to decompress from work by talking about it, she wants to decompress by not talking about it. The rule has become that he NEVER gets to talk about it, so who is actually the one with the needs that supercedes the other?", "What? The \u201cneed\u201d to not hear her husband talk? Yes, it\u2019s a boring conversation. So what? Lots of things in relationships aren\u2019t fun. You know how many times I\u2019ve given a damn about my girlfriends day? 0. You know how many times I\u2019ve listened about her day? All of them. Because it literally does no harm, and it\u2019s for the benefit of the relationship. I swear 90% of people in this sub are people who never matured past middle school."]}
