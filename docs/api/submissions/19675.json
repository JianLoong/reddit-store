The moment he gets home, he starts talking about his day. He's a surgeon and he starts to talk about his surgery in details and it's pretty technical. I'm here trying to destress from my day and deal with our one year old boy and he just basically describes his entire day in detail.\n\nIt sounds like \"Then I opened the right arm, harvested the radial flap by myself, and the nerves were hard to identify so that took an extra 30 minutes there, then i had to suture the vessels under the microscope and it kept fogging up...\" (Except in even more detail).\n\nI got annoyed and I told him I don't really want to listen to his medical cases and it stresses me out because then I feel like I'm back at work. When I'm done with work, I want to be done with work and not feel like I'm in the OR still. I have told him this multiple times before. He continues to do it. So about once a week, he forgets and will go on and on about his surgery for 30+ min until I get fed up and I tell him to stop talking about surgery.\n\nAfter this argument, he says he doesn't feel supported and feels like he can't talk to me. I feel like an AH as well because I don't have the mental capacity to listen to him recap his entire day in detail without being mentally draining on me. I feel like a horrible person but I don't know if this is normal or if I'm just being an AH.\n\n\nEdit for detail:\n\nHe doesn\u2019t talk about his day as \u201coh this crazy thing happened\u201d. He talks about it as if he\u2019s giving me a lecture and i\u2019m a med student. \n\nIf i did it, it would sound like this:\n\n\u201cToday, i went to see my patient at 7 am. But she wasn\u2019t in her gown yet so i had to wait 10 min for her to get dressed. Then the nurse had troubles drawing her blood and place an IV so that slowed my start of the day and i had to di the iv myself. Then i had to use a translator because she only spoke spanish, and that meant we started the case 15 min lter than expected. Then i rolled the patient into the Or. then i plced the pulse ox, ekg, and bp on the patient. Then i had her breathe 5 deep breaths and then i started to give 2 mg of versed, then i gave her 70 mg lidocaine and 75 mcg of fentanyl, but when i pushed propofol, she still had pain. After she went to sleep, i checked to make sure she can be masked. Then i gave 50 mg roc, then i bagged some more, then i used a miller 2 blade to get a view of the vocal cords, then i intubated the patient\u2026\u201d\n\nThat would only describe the first 30 min of his day. Then he would continue to describe the remaining 9.5 hrs of his day in detail as if he is teaching a med student. I\u2019m not a surgeon for a reason. And even if i was, i don\u2019t want to mentally do surgery when i am off.\n\nIt\u2019s not like \u201coh, a bunch of my cases got delayed so i\u2019m back late. Oh that nurse was on my nerves.

They both want to destress in different ways. That would definitely be exhausting to \u2018take your work home.\u2019 Maybe allocate a short time for shop talk (ie 30 mins) and then agree with no more for the night and talk about something else positive going on in your lives.", "NTA.  I get it, my husband used to do the same thing all the time, and I worked a stressful job that I really needed to decompress from when I\u2019d get home.  We agreed that we would not talk at length about things when we first get home, we would hug and \u201cI missed you\u201d and then do our own thing for a bit, then later hang out together and talk about our day.  It worked beautifully.  Maybe there\u2019s a good compromise to be found?", "NTA. I feel like people are missing the fact that he's not just saying \"I had a difficult surgery today\" and explaining briefly why. He's going into minute details. And you also work in the OR. Do YOU get to destress at the end of the day?\nMaybe you can compromise by telling him that of course he's allowed to talk about his day but it needs to be broad strokes or he needs to wait until the baby is in bed or something.", "ESH - Hear me out.\n\nYou suck because he obviously needs to share his day with you. It's a pretty common aspect in many relationships. You're *not* supporting him in this, and it's understandable why he feels like he can't talk to you. It blows to have the one person you want to talk to the most tell you over and over again they don't want to listen to what you have to say.\n\nHe sucks because you've articulated how much and why this frustrates you, and he's not taking you into consideration when he continues to do so. You're setting a boundary and he's not being receptive. So he's *also* not being supportive of *you* in this.\n\nIt sounds like a compromise is the best solution here. He can still talk about his day, but not in so much detail and not for longer than a determined amount of time. He could even ask you if you'd be up for him talking about it. If he begins to go deeper into detail to a point that it's bothersome for you, have a codeword ready that can neutrally remind him to keep shop talk to a minimum. This way, you are still supporting him and listening to him, but he's also respecting your boundary of not wanting to feel like you're back at work.\n\nIt can be difficult when partners are on opposite sides of a situation like this, but as long as both of you actively practice patience, clear communication, boundary setting/respecting, and the understanding that sometimes even the best-laid plans have hiccups, it'll work out.", "NAH.\n\nPeople need to de-stress after their days. It looks different for different people, and when you throw caring for young children into the mix, it can be very frustrating.\n\nIf his way of de-stressing is to verbally vent his frustrations about work, maybe discuss ways you can be present for him for a specified time (5-10 minutes?) while you both do some of the housework and childcare activities together. \n\nSometimes, taking a walk on a pre-planned route can give routine time limits to the post-work spewing while getting you all out of the house and giving him some dedicated time to talk about his day. Exercise on his own immediately after work can give him more of a transition time to physically vent frustration as well. \n\nYou might discuss with him that the extreme details are tedious for you, and while they're relevant for him, they're not as important for you to be able to understand his day. Ask him if he can condense the specifics to something that would make sense to a layperson when explained quickly (even though you DO understand the details). For some people, on the other hand, talking out the details can be a way to verbally process and identify specific emotions and sources of frustration, so you might ask him if that's what he's doing and have him really think about his answer.\n\nIf he's not in therapy, seeing a therapist would give him another person to help him mindfully communicate with you and better identify what he needs when he comes home from work. Likewise, if you're seeing a therapist, ask them for suggestions on how to honor your boundaries while still meeting his needs and your child's needs.  \n\nAsking if he wants to vent, wants advice, or wants support can be really useful as well because it dictates what he wants from you during the exchange.", "NTA. Your husband is not respecting your time or comfort level. It would be one thing if he wanted to check in with you and vent a little that it was a rough day. But you are not obligated by your wedding vows to listen to him exhaustively narrate every gory detail of a medical case. If he were a supportive husband he would not be stressing you out like this. He needs to find a therapist he can talk to and not dump this on you.", "NTA. 100% understand having boundaries about bringing work stuff home. If you\u2019re at this point I imagine it\u2019s been pervasive and relentless and you\u2019ve bought it up before which has been ignored many times. \n\nEncourage him to get a work crew for social support/debriefing. Or set timers where you both concisely summarise your day and have a conversation not about work.", "NTA\n\nYou need to decompress at the end of the day. For you that means not talking about work. I get that. \n\nIf he occasionally spoke about something special, that would be different. But it sounds like he\u2019s just dumping his entire day on you every evening. That\u2019s a lot.", "NTA.  You and your husband both work. He's marginalizing your job and your parental contributions.  If it were a two sided conversation it would be different,  but it sounds like he's monopolizing the conversation.  \n\nYou have every right to be able to destress after work and child care. Hopefully,  he is taking responsibility for your child too. \n\nSuggest he tell your child about his day while you relax with a glass of wine or agree on a list of topics for a post work chat like the weather or your time off plans or your child.", "NTA.   It's OK to occasionally want sympathy from one's partner if you had a particularly rough day, but there's still no need for a detailed play by play.\n\nIf he wanted support, he's be talking about his feelings or stressors about the day (or part of it) in general, not just spouting off a step by step recreation of his entire shift, which is usually something people do when they simply A) don't know any better or B) are looking for validation.  Since you've solved A by telling him to knock it off and he continues, assume B.", "YTA. I get it might be annoying everyday, and you clearly have different communication styles. But you said it\u2019s now only once a week when he forgets and you can\u2019t even handle that. I personally couldn\u2019t be with someone that got mad at me every time I wanted to talk about my day. Honestly, it seems a little extreme to insist that he never speaks of it.", "YTA. However, he's not completely blameless. I can completely understand not wanting to feel like your are at work with all the details but he's telling you this because he's comfortable with you and it's important to him to share with his family. I do think you should set ground rules, as in when he can talk about it, how much details he goes into, and, also recognizing when you are stressed form your child. Don't make it an argument but approach it like\n\n\"I want to hear you and support you but I am stressed at (certain time of taking care of your chid\" so can we talk about it latter in the evening\" Or \"I want to hear baout your day and support you but can you please not go into so much detail, i feel like im at work\"", "YTA. \n\nYou should both want to tell each other about your day, who else would you tell? You guys are married right? \n\nI always tell my best friend everything.", "YTA:\n\n If you don't want to talk to your spouse about their day, why are you married? Open and honest communication is part of any relationship. If you didn't want to have conversations with him (about his work or anything else), that would have been a factor to think about **before** getting married - not after.", "NTA, but I understand your husband here. I do have a grandson who liked to relate everything right after a big experience\u2014such as when he built his own  computer, and later, first time he co-flew a plane, or he was at a really good conference and had a lot to think about\u2014things like that.  He always thanked me for listening and once explained that if he could talk to someone right after an important experience, he would then be able to retain it. It was almost as if he were recording himself\u2014so it sounded very rote, and whoever was on the listening end would kind of be thinking, do I need to be here for this, but in fact, what cemented his memory was having a person listen. I had all the time in the world so it was fine with me. He still does this with his mother now and then. It will be midnight and she is dying to go to sleep but she doesn't see him often, or hear from him often, so he asks if she has time to hear what he is thinking about and she says yes and just listens. Again, NTA here, you need a break right when your husband needs to talk, and that's something that you will have  to figure out\u2014but I would not have listened to my husband at that time of day either. The dynamic between partners has to be more equal, especially when you are raising little kids and working.", "YTA. put yourself in his shoes. imagine you had a stressful day and you wanted to tell your husband a story about work and he practically told you to shut up. some people's way to destress is to talk about things that may have stressed them throughout the day. maybe your husband is like that", "YTA. Be glad your husband does want to share his day with you. If you push him away with this, what's he going to think when he needs to come to you with something serious?", "YTA\n\nYour husband wants to engage with you and talk about his day. Maybe try having an actual discussion with him. You both work in medicine so I can't imagine it would be impossible to spin a topic off of one of his surgery stories. Or talk about your day every once in a while.  Honestly, I can't understand why people like you get into relationships when all you can think about is your own feelings and not the fact that your partner just wants to talk to you.", "YTA\nId get it if it was everyday, cause I have a psychiatrist in the family and I know how tiring it can be when they talk for hours about very tough subjects, and I also had to ask for her to stop doing it so often if it was everyday for hours. But I have the time and patience cause I love her to listen to her at least a few times a week, or anytime when she really needs it, its a rough job and people need to vent and you also need to compromise in relationships and give support. You cant expect him to never talk about his job.", "YTA. He's excited about his day and wants to share it with you because he loves to talk to you. If my spouse told me to not talk to him about work it would make me sad. He's destressing too.", "YTA single people don't have to do any of that stuff. Sounds like you were better off back then.\n\nETA: honestly surprised by the downvotes, but i stand by it.

Add a hard limit of half an hour once a week, no more than 15 mins other days, and that might make it more bearable for you.\n\nAnother option could be no work talk immediately after work - he can journal or whatever if he needs to get things out immediately - and all focus is on getting kid and adults shifted into evening mode. Later on you make time most but not all evenings for a little bit of work decompression talk - which comes with him giving you a back rub while he\u2019s talking it through, or some similar thing that adds something pleasant to the interaction for you. Or he gets that time, but the price of that is that he takes kiddo for the same amount of time right after work while you get a shower in blissful peace and aren\u2019t bothered by anyone. Whatever works for you as a trade off.\n\nAnother option might be just swapping out your way and his way days - on your-way days, no work talk at home; on his way days, he gets 15 minutes to decompress out loud, half an hour once a week, and you\u2019ll listen without censure.\n\nEither way there needs to be a negotiation about how and when the work talk happens. Since he is clearly in the habit and forgets and that annoys you, you need to find a way you can remind him without it becoming a \u201cyou\u2019re going on again and you always do this\u2014\u201c row.

None of us can just stop feeling the need to vent. \n\nIf you\u2019re fine with that you\u2019ll have to explain that you just can\u2019t mentally be that person for him and figure out a solution, but he\u2019s already told you it makes him feel like you don\u2019t support him, so you\u2019ll have to be careful that you find other ways so that he feels like you\u2019re supporting him (not just that you think you are).\nOr maybe set some rules, I want to be here for you, it is very draining on me, can we set a time limit and then you do something that gives you a way to decompress\u2026\n\nBut yeah I think it\u2019s normal for everyone to need to vent about their days.", "NTA (though bordering near N A H), I\u2019ve said it before when it was the woman doing the dumping and it is the same in this case. Occasionally venting to your partner is one thing so long as everyone is on the same page about the proper time and place for it. But using them as a heat sink for daily complaints is ridiculous. And getting a full recap of the inane details about your day is not much better.", "I guess I\u2019m in the minority here so maybe I need more info? I was married to someone who straight up told me they didn\u2019t care to hear me talk about my day and it was very hurtful. \n\nWith my spouse now, sometimes he wants to tell me all about his day or his hobbies that I might not necessarily be interested in or able to talk in depth about (guitar for example). Those things don\u2019t always interest me, but I can tell he\u2019s really excited and that makes me happy, so I try to listen and respond as I\u2019m able.  \n\nMaybe OP just needs a chance to unwind/destress and then you can both figure out some kind of compromise?", "I can understand you and your husband's side but YTA. I too would not feel supported or even loved if you didn't want to hear me talk (because that's important to me). I personally would just walk away if I didn't have a kid with you. I listen to my gf every day when she gets home even if she goes off on ADHD tangents because that's what I signed up for 4 years ago. She listens to me rant about stuff for long periods of time because she knows that's who I am. I don't like listening to my gf go off about roller coaster engineering and the entire history of rollercoasters or makeup but I sit there and watch documentaries and even look it up myself to show her I care about her interests.", "Not the same, but my wife works in a vet, I work IT for a 911 dispatch center.\n\nWhile I don't necessarily care about the things she is saying when my wife vents, I recognize her venting is a good way to destress, as I am the same way.\n\nDo I want to hear about a dogs anal gland that blew? No, but I know her talking about how much that sucks really lets her vent, and she does the same for me when I am talking about fixing a pc while a dispatcher is on the phone with someone on fire.\n\nIf either of us felt like we really couldnt handle it at that time, COMMUNICATE that.\n\nThis is one of those \"compromise\" situations that no couple on this sub ever seems like they even have that in their vocabulary.", "Defenitly NTA. My boyfriend do thats too, I have to listen to him but he don't listen to me.. My story are to boring. What's about his?!", "Swap the sexes on this one and OP would be TA for sure. Because then it would be a man not supporting or listening to his wife. But it\u2019s ok to tell a dude to shut-up.", "NTA. I hate this, when I\u2019m home from work, let\u2019s all not relive work.  Work is over for now, shut the fuck up about it lol.", "I'm going against the group: YTA\n\nIf you are married, you should want to hear about his day and he about yours. It's not always interesting, but it can be very helpful for someone to talk things out, bounce ideas off each other, and get advice from someone not directly involved in the work. \n\nMy husband and I discuss our days when we get home. There are some days that one of us is really tired, but we make the effort. We're there to support each other. I will start discussing things and situations that he has no experience with, but he often gives me advice or input that I had not thought of. \n\nSometimes you have to suck it up and be bored if it helps your partner.", "NTA.  But he is trying to engage with you (as his spouse) and you are denying him that (rightly or wrongly).  You need to work out some way for both of you to be happy.  Otherwise this small issue will turn into a big issue.  He also needs to understand your feelings and why its too much, especially with a child.  Neither of you are horrible people; you are not communicating well.  \n\nA friend of mine told me a story about his dad:  after a long day of work, he would come home, pour a large glass of wine, no one was allowed to talk to him until the glass was empty, and then when he was finished everyone could bombard him with their issues.  It worked for him, it worked for them.", "NTA. As a physician (not a surgeon), I can\u2019t even understand how he wants to do this. Man has to do the surgery, dictate op/procedure notes, document or sign off on progress notes, and then he wants to go home and do it all again?\n\nBut to each his own? Maybe he needs a forum like Sermo or specifical surgical groups (I\u2019m sure his professional societies have interest groups). \n\nWhenever I recap my day for my wife, it\u2019s not a play-by-play, it\u2019s more of a \u201chere\u2019s a packaged/condensed (and deidentified!) narrative of something I saw today, which I\u2019m telling you because it was interesting or frustrating or whatever.\u201d", "My husband is gone now, but he never talked much about his work. Wish he had and I could have listened. You two need to reach a compromise.", "I sometimes get the electrician version of this.  If he would do this while sitting at the kitchen table & directing kid traffic while I was cooking dinner, it would be less taxing to my adhd wired brain because I have the distraction of cooking that allows me to focus on his conversation.", "NAH. But it\u2019s obvious that he takes an issue with this. Perhaps dedicate a specific time during the week or day with overly detailed talk? Have you tried just asking him to be less detailed?", "YTA for losing your cool. working in the medical field is tough work in all aspects. I had my fair share of absolutely dreadful days when I worked as a Phlebotomist at a hospital. Whether it be a PT coding while I was collecting specimens or a PT assaulting me while collecting specimens or a bad trauma call. Hell, I have been shot at in the Trauma room. Whatever it may be that you do at a hospital, the support of your spouse is what you look for. If I didn't have that, I would have probably killed myself. Your SO is just trying to cope. He's just trying to get a little support. Even if it's an exaggerated \" OH WOW,\" it means the world. It means we are being heard. If you both work medical, then you should get it. You should understand that his venting about work is because he isn't being heard at work and isn't getting support there. We tend to do things for our significant others that we don't like because we love them. You may not want to listen to it but your spouse hurting or struggling is far worse than just taking the time to listen.", "NAH \n\nYou both work in medicine and have a 1 year old - that is *tiring* \n\nYou have different needs and need to sit down and talk about how you can both support each other. It sounds like your husband is trying since you say slips up once a week, where is the compromise for him? Or what could he do to help meet your needs so you can better also meet his?", "I guess when you spent most of your life studying ONE subject, and then work all day doing that ONE subject, it leaves no time to have any other areas of interest in your life. Does he have any hobbies?", "NTA\n\nIts ok for him to want to talk to you about his day, but I have to agree with you that it sounds like he just goes into waaaaay too much detail. Maybe ask him to limit work talk to like a quick 15-30 min recap or something, & then move on to other stuff. Work should really be left at work for the most part.....", "You are a human. You don't have infinite energy. If he needs an outlet for every single little piece of minutia in his day, I'd suggest he starts keeping a diary. I don't mean that in a condescending way, a friend of mine who deals with stressful, monotonous work took up writing it down in a diary to help him process it and it genuinely helped him. Maybe something for your husband to try? Could pitch it as keeping a \"journal\" if you worry the word \"diary\" may undermine the idea.   \n\n\nYou're not an AH for setting a boundary of \"Hey, I don't want to think about work for hours when I'm not at work.\" At the same time, if something exceptional *did* happen during his workday, I'm sure you would be there to support him.", "NTA. I understand wanting to talk about your day but damn that\u2019s a lot. Maybe he could start journaling maybe. Then he could get those\u2026very detailed thoughts out of his head.", "Nah, my husband and I ask each other how our days have gone when we get home from work, normally he\u2019s got a story to tell about some assholes at work or a particularly hard job he\u2019s had to spend all day doing, but he won\u2019t talk forever about it, unless it\u2019s something that\u2019s affected him personally, like upset him in some way, or it\u2019s an ongoing issue we both know about. \n\nHe will then ask about my day and I\u2019ll give him a quick run down as I work in a hospital with patients and it can be quite stressful and sometimes upsetting so it helps to talk about it sometimes, which maybe is the same for your husband, but again I don\u2019t detail everything that happened in my day, he doesn\u2019t need to know that.  Our whole conversation about the day may take about an hour or so, with other topics sprinkled in and then we don\u2019t talk about work anymore. The rest of the day/evening is about unwinding and being together. \n\nYour husband should respect the fact that you don\u2019t want to hear minute details about his work, you just want to know about how he\u2019s doing. You can be supportive of him without feeling like you\u2019ve sat in on every surgery he\u2019s done because he\u2019s given you so much detail. Also he doesn\u2019t seem to ask you how you\u2019ve been. There needs to be some give and take, like him helping with your son whilst he talks to you (in a shortened recapped version of his day) and then you both agree to not talk about work after that.", "One of the best things a spouse can do is listen to the trivial comings and goings of their spouse. That includes \"their day\" regardless how boring.\n\nAfter my mother died, I found my dad would share the trivialities of his day with me when I called. I realized Mom filled that role for him and now I did that for him.\n\nNot voting \"Yes\" on the AITA, just giving a different perspective.", "I like the air lock method. \n\nIt\u2019s a place where work and personal life meet for a  pre-determined brief period. After that period is over, the changeover from work life to personal life is concluded.\n\nNAH", "INFO: how long have you two been together? Did this behavior just start or have you been okay with it up until recently?", "NAH. I can see why that would be really annoying - if my husband launched into a medical lecture while I was trying to get a baby fed and bathed etc it would be extremely grating! But I can also see that this is his way of decompressing although it's not very considerate of him to offload on you like this when you already have your hands full! Me and my husband work in the same industry and we used to work in the same company. We found we were talking about work way too much and I got sick of it so we had to make a rule that we would only talk about work on the commute in order to compartmentalise things and not feel like work was our whole life. Maybe you need to agree when work talk time is and when family time is so you can have a bit of give and take.", "It sounds as though your husband does this as his own way of destressing. Maybe he feels like you're the only person on this planet he feels he can do that with. Or he seriously needs to see a therapist for other options to help him find other ways to destress. Definitely worth looking into another possible way for him to get through what happened in his workday and keep from getting a divorce later.", "NTA. He needs to learn to be succinct. I had a similar situation with my wife. My job is super stressful and I need to decompress at the end of the day but I'm a very intent listener so when she'd drop a lot of unnecessary exposition it would be mentally draining because I'm paying attention like those details are going to be relevant later, but they're not.\n\nWe simply talked it through and sometimes after she tells a story she'll realize it was longer than it needed to be and ask what details I'd have cut out. Incremental improvement works!", "My wife and I had a house rule that we could talk about work for thirty minutes when we got home. It's nice to decompress without turning into an all night thing.", "I get it. I really, really do. I\u2019m a high school teacher who is also an introvert with ADHD and a toddler at home. People talk at me all day long every day, and I love my job but it\u2019s overwhelming. My husband works from home and is an extrovert. \n\nWe have conflicting needs. He needs to mentally unpack his day by telling me in detail everything he did that day. *I* need some time with my thoughts and a bit of quiet to mentally unpack my own day. It can be super overstimulating to listen to him tell me every detail when he gets home, but like your husband, he needs this. I believe it is a legitimate need. We\u2019ve compromised in that I shared this with him and asked if I could have some time to unwind with quiet before we talk about our days. He agreed, and things are much better.\n\nI would say a gentle YTA because not hearing about your partner\u2019s day is unfair. Part of being in a relationship is being that listening ear for your spouse. You need to come up with a compromise that still lets his needs get met. Ask for some quiet time. Read a book, take a walk, watch a show, whatever you need. Get out of work mode; that\u2019s fair And then give him some time to do his daily recap and listen (or just nod and make affirming noises at the appropriate times\u2014I often zone out.) It\u2019s important to him and part of a healthy relationship.", "I hope your husband now talks to your son about his day when he gets home.", "NAH but y'all better find ways to communicate this stuff to one another and be accepting and non-judgemental when shit like this comes up. I'm 50, and the wife and I still find ways to screw up like this. It can be hard to find ways through things that you just plain don't agree on, but you are going to have to if you want the marriage to last.\n\nGood luck :)", "NTA. He should keep a journal.", "NTA - that\u2019s a debrief and wayyy too much. \n\nMaybe asked if you can implement a \u201c5 minute share\u201d where you each talk about the high and lowlights of the day.

If he wants your feedback, he needs to give you a chance to respond.", "Gonna go against the grain here and say YTA\n\nI don't think its that you said something its how you described yourself to have said it.\n\nI think its important for partners to show interest in each other's lives. As a surgeon, a lot of your husband's day will revolve around that (I'd imagine). I think saying something like \"I want to hear about your day but it stresses me out to hear about such specific details, if you can please try and dial that back\". Or \" I want to listen to what your saying but its hard for me to pay close attention for 30 minutes, if you can summarize a bit more I'd appreciate it\".\n\nMy wife is a nurse, and I'm very squeamish so I've asked her to please leave out specific medical details when recapping her day.

Then maybe after the child goes to bed, you could talk about your respective days.  \n\nYour husband doesn\u2019t understand that *at that moment*, you are overwhelmed and can\u2019t focus on him.

My phone would be going off, messages pinging. People trying to work on things with me were left hanging. I couldn't taoe a moment to tell them I'd check back in an hour because that was rude to him. I couldn't tell anyone who started checking in with me on work things that I'd get back to them because I was rude to ignore him. \n\nIt was never a conversation.

I feel like everyoen satsin N T A has never been in a relationship before.", "> that man could take the scenic route to any point.\n\nWhat a great turn of phrase.", "It does come off as dismissive. Because I'm sure the other person does enjoy a portion of that time but their annoyance is much higher. \n\nI hated working in labor and delivery, I can look back on the rare good times but the entire thing is a sour note in my career. As is this relationship can be good but these moments are the sour notes in it. Not everything has to be or can be enjoyed at every moment.", "Disagree, sounds line he has a scientific Monday and speaks in details out of habit. He likely spoke like this long before it annoyed OP", "we truly live in a society.", "Hahahaha I just read that to my husband. \u201cWell put!\u201d he said. Don\u2019t forget about abrasives, too.", "I can really resent somebody using me as an audience.  If they aren't attempting to read the room or engage me in what they are talking about, I basically feel used. \n\n I don't mean I feel used with someone who I meet during my day who does this, I mean I feel used when someone who knows me well and is supposed to care about me is talking AT me and doesn't seem to care at all about MY experience of their repeated lecturing.", "Weirdly, could he journal, do a voice memo, or organise a group of fellow surgeons or other professionals to each destress about their week? Then come home to you and have conversations which you can both participate in and bond together, rather than just using you as a mirror?", "OMG he is INSUFFERABLE! How do you put up with him? He's so me, me, me. Sounds like he has a massive ego and you do the heavy lifting at home. What are you getting out of this relationship aside from being financially well off? I wouldn't be able to stand a man like this.  \n\n\nHe is treating you like his emotional support animal and dumping ground. the selfishness of it all.", "No I'm totally down with that! I talk a lot with my 4 month old.", "I bet back then hubby was also interested in her day and what she had to say, as well.", "I prefer scientific Tuesday\u2019s myself.", "My husband talks like this. He's allowed to tell me the boring day stuff when we're laying in bed. I love his voice, it drifts me off to sleep, and he doesn't need my feedback so I don't really have to pay attention. He can tell me unusual or exciting things when he gets home, but the minutia is bedtime stories.", "Unfortunately tiktok caps at 3 min instead of 60 lol", "OP stated that this happens about once a week, that\u2019s certainly not every day. You\u2019re making a huge assumption that the husband is doing this purely to inflate his ego or because he wants to devalue OP\u2019s time, when it really sounds like he\u2019s unloading from a tough day at work. There\u2019s this thing you do in a healthy relationship where you listen to and support your partner.", "Why did they even get married if she doesn't like to listen to him even for one day? People are different, and some speak like this. It's unlikely he changed after marriage. Just imagine, coming home from work wanting to share your day with your loved one, and she tells you \"shut the f up, you're boring, I don't like your stories\"", "Oh that\u2019s true. I was grasping for straws thinking of examples of firm boundaries but didn\u2019t fully cook that thought. Definitely don\u2019t endorse the silent treatment. I\u2019ll leave it for posterity.", "OP added those details after I commented", "It's NOW once a week because he \"forgets\" that it bothers her. It's not just the time though, it's the way he talks about it. He's not sharing something big that happened or telling a story, he's just going through the minutia of his day. It doesn't sound like she's talking about him unloading something that's weighing on him, he's literally just giving her a super detailed day recap.", "Haha, people that aren\u2019t compatible get married all the time. Personally, I think it\u2019s an epidemic. But food for thought, just like there are people that like to talk and converse all the time, there are others that prefer not to and enjoy silence. Neither is in the wrong, it\u2019s just that in this case OP is saying that it\u2019s getting overwhelming.", "She never said she doesn\u2019t like to listen to him. She said she doesn\u2019t want to hear the IN DETAIL SURGERY stories. I wouldn\u2019t want to hear you describe how you cut open a patient and moved their liver to their intestines in great detail. He could talk about ANYHTING else and I guarantee she\u2019d be ok with it. She specifically says what her issue is with what he talks about. You\u2019re making what she said more vague to fit a narrative.", "She WAS IN THE VERY SAME ROOM AS HIM - why does she need to listen to him when she was RIGHT THERE THE WHOLE TIME??  He's goes WAAAAAY past 'sharing his day'.", "Okay I see", "As a trauma surgeon, death is even not that common in the OR but in ICU and shock room.", "So clearly he\u2019s working on it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s like \u201cI can\u2019t wait to disrespect my partner\u2019s opinion once a week!\u201d He told OP he feels unsupported, so this indicated to me that this is him needing to unload. OP offered no solution and basically told their husband that they are emotionally unavailable for the support he needs here, and there is a zero tolerance policy for him forgetting once a week. You really seem to be keyed in on the fact that he must be bragging and doing this because he doesn\u2019t care about OP and I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re projecting that here.", "She said she works in the OR. But there might be more then one OR in the city", "But the husband is no doubt looking for someone to react appropriately \u201coh really? And did that go smoothly? Oh what did he say? Etc\u201d. Not just to say the words like a robot with a smile.", "This isn't a thing he needs a lot of time to work on. Frankly, he should have figured out that no one wants to listen to a detailed account of his day at work a long time ago.", "In one of OP's comments she said there actually was an instance where the husband was doing this and she actually *had* been in the OR with him. Husband thought she was rude for pointing it out.", "No, I don't think she would like it if instead of ignoring his child or household at home, he ignored his child and household from a bar.", "Cool, she doesn't want that. He needs to adapt.", "UGH.  This man doesn't want to read the room.  It bores her and re-stresses her to hear a blow-by-blow on each of his surgeries.\n\nI'm thinking he could do the information dump with their toddler and husband and OP could have a happier evening.", "I'm curious why it is you assume he's an absentee father.", "Serious question: do you think a surgeon can't have ADHD?", "Yes, which is why I'm suggesting that just because the husband isn't \"watching the kids\" doesn't mean he isn't doing anything to help. We don't really have that information either way, but the person I replied to just wants to make up a situation they can be mad about. \n\nJust like you're making up a reason to argue with me about it."]}
