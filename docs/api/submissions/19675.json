They both want to destress in different ways. That would definitely be exhausting to \u2018take your work home.\u2019 Maybe allocate a short time for shop talk (ie 30 mins) and then agree with no more for the night and talk about something else positive going on in your lives.", "NTA.  I get it, my husband used to do the same thing all the time, and I worked a stressful job that I really needed to decompress from when I\u2019d get home.  We agreed that we would not talk at length about things when we first get home, we would hug and \u201cI missed you\u201d and then do our own thing for a bit, then later hang out together and talk about our day.  It worked beautifully.  Maybe there\u2019s a good compromise to be found?", "NTA. I feel like people are missing the fact that he's not just saying \"I had a difficult surgery today\" and explaining briefly why. He's going into minute details. And you also work in the OR. Do YOU get to destress at the end of the day?\nMaybe you can compromise by telling him that of course he's allowed to talk about his day but it needs to be broad strokes or he needs to wait until the baby is in bed or something.", "ESH - Hear me out.\n\nYou suck because he obviously needs to share his day with you. It's a pretty common aspect in many relationships. You're *not* supporting him in this, and it's understandable why he feels like he can't talk to you. It blows to have the one person you want to talk to the most tell you over and over again they don't want to listen to what you have to say.\n\nHe sucks because you've articulated how much and why this frustrates you, and he's not taking you into consideration when he continues to do so. You're setting a boundary and he's not being receptive. So he's *also* not being supportive of *you* in this.\n\nIt sounds like a compromise is the best solution here. He can still talk about his day, but not in so much detail and not for longer than a determined amount of time. He could even ask you if you'd be up for him talking about it. If he begins to go deeper into detail to a point that it's bothersome for you, have a codeword ready that can neutrally remind him to keep shop talk to a minimum. This way, you are still supporting him and listening to him, but he's also respecting your boundary of not wanting to feel like you're back at work.\n\nIt can be difficult when partners are on opposite sides of a situation like this, but as long as both of you actively practice patience, clear communication, boundary setting/respecting, and the understanding that sometimes even the best-laid plans have hiccups, it'll work out.", "NAH.\n\nPeople need to de-stress after their days. It looks different for different people, and when you throw caring for young children into the mix, it can be very frustrating.\n\nIf his way of de-stressing is to verbally vent his frustrations about work, maybe discuss ways you can be present for him for a specified time (5-10 minutes?) while you both do some of the housework and childcare activities together. \n\nSometimes, taking a walk on a pre-planned route can give routine time limits to the post-work spewing while getting you all out of the house and giving him some dedicated time to talk about his day. Exercise on his own immediately after work can give him more of a transition time to physically vent frustration as well. \n\nYou might discuss with him that the extreme details are tedious for you, and while they're relevant for him, they're not as important for you to be able to understand his day. Ask him if he can condense the specifics to something that would make sense to a layperson when explained quickly (even though you DO understand the details). For some people, on the other hand, talking out the details can be a way to verbally process and identify specific emotions and sources of frustration, so you might ask him if that's what he's doing and have him really think about his answer.\n\nIf he's not in therapy, seeing a therapist would give him another person to help him mindfully communicate with you and better identify what he needs when he comes home from work. Likewise, if you're seeing a therapist, ask them for suggestions on how to honor your boundaries while still meeting his needs and your child's needs.  \n\nAsking if he wants to vent, wants advice, or wants support can be really useful as well because it dictates what he wants from you during the exchange.", "NTA. Your husband is not respecting your time or comfort level. It would be one thing if he wanted to check in with you and vent a little that it was a rough day. But you are not obligated by your wedding vows to listen to him exhaustively narrate every gory detail of a medical case. If he were a supportive husband he would not be stressing you out like this. He needs to find a therapist he can talk to and not dump this on you.", "NTA. 100% understand having boundaries about bringing work stuff home. If you\u2019re at this point I imagine it\u2019s been pervasive and relentless and you\u2019ve bought it up before which has been ignored many times. \n\nEncourage him to get a work crew for social support/debriefing. Or set timers where you both concisely summarise your day and have a conversation not about work.", "NTA\n\nYou need to decompress at the end of the day. For you that means not talking about work. I get that. \n\nIf he occasionally spoke about something special, that would be different. But it sounds like he\u2019s just dumping his entire day on you every evening. That\u2019s a lot.", "NTA.  You and your husband both work. He's marginalizing your job and your parental contributions.  If it were a two sided conversation it would be different,  but it sounds like he's monopolizing the conversation.  \n\nYou have every right to be able to destress after work and child care. Hopefully,  he is taking responsibility for your child too. \n\nSuggest he tell your child about his day while you relax with a glass of wine or agree on a list of topics for a post work chat like the weather or your time off plans or your child.", "NTA.   It's OK to occasionally want sympathy from one's partner if you had a particularly rough day, but there's still no need for a detailed play by play.\n\nIf he wanted support, he's be talking about his feelings or stressors about the day (or part of it) in general, not just spouting off a step by step recreation of his entire shift, which is usually something people do when they simply A) don't know any better or B) are looking for validation.  Since you've solved A by telling him to knock it off and he continues, assume B.", "YTA. I get it might be annoying everyday, and you clearly have different communication styles. But you said it\u2019s now only once a week when he forgets and you can\u2019t even handle that. I personally couldn\u2019t be with someone that got mad at me every time I wanted to talk about my day. Honestly, it seems a little extreme to insist that he never speaks of it.", "YTA. However, he's not completely blameless. I can completely understand not wanting to feel like your are at work with all the details but he's telling you this because he's comfortable with you and it's important to him to share with his family. I do think you should set ground rules, as in when he can talk about it, how much details he goes into, and, also recognizing when you are stressed form your child. Don't make it an argument but approach it like\n\n\"I want to hear you and support you but I am stressed at (certain time of taking care of your chid\" so can we talk about it latter in the evening\" Or \"I want to hear baout your day and support you but can you please not go into so much detail, i feel like im at work\"\n\nYTA.

Open and honest communication is part of any relationship. If you didn't want to have conversations with him (about his work or anything else), that would have been a factor to think about **before** getting married - not after.", "NTA, but I understand your husband here. I do have a grandson who liked to relate everything right after a big experience\u2014such as when he built his own  computer, and later, first time he co-flew a plane, or he was at a really good conference and had a lot to think about\u2014things like that.  He always thanked me for listening and once explained that if he could talk to someone right after an important experience, he would then be able to retain it. It was almost as if he were recording himself\u2014so it sounded very rote, and whoever was on the listening end would kind of be thinking, do I need to be here for this, but in fact, what cemented his memory was having a person listen. I had all the time in the world so it was fine with me. He still does this with his mother now and then. It will be midnight and she is dying to go to sleep but she doesn't see him often, or hear from him often, so he asks if she has time to hear what he is thinking about and she says yes and just listens. Again, NTA here, you need a break right when your husband needs to talk, and that's something that you will have  to figure out\u2014but I would not have listened to my husband at that time of day either. The dynamic between partners has to be more equal, especially when you are raising little kids and working.", "YTA. put yourself in his shoes. imagine you had a stressful day and you wanted to tell your husband a story about work and he practically told you to shut up. some people's way to destress is to talk about things that may have stressed them throughout the day. maybe your husband is like that", "YTA.

If you push him away with this, what's he going to think when he needs to come to you with something serious?", "YTA\n\nYour husband wants to engage with you and talk about his day. Maybe try having an actual discussion with him. You both work in medicine so I can't imagine it would be impossible to spin a topic off of one of his surgery stories. Or talk about your day every once in a while.  Honestly, I can't understand why people like you get into relationships when all you can think about is your own feelings and not the fact that your partner just wants to talk to you.", "YTA\nId get it if it was everyday, cause I have a psychiatrist in the family and I know how tiring it can be when they talk for hours about very tough subjects, and I also had to ask for her to stop doing it so often if it was everyday for hours. But I have the time and patience cause I love her to listen to her at least a few times a week, or anytime when she really needs it, its a rough job and people need to vent and you also need to compromise in relationships and give support. You cant expect him to never talk about his job.", "YTA. He's excited about his day and wants to share it with you because he loves to talk to you. If my spouse told me to not talk to him about work it would make me sad. He's destressing too.", "YTA single people don't have to do any of that stuff.
