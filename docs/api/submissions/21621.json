She went through a breakup over a year ago and has let herself go since. I think she genuinely has no idea. \n\nShe wears things that are horrifying for someone of her size. I\u2019m talking low waisted, teeny tiny sweatshorts and a brandy Melville tiny tank top. Her stomach/gut bulges out. She is walking around like this while my parents have guests over. I think my mom doesn\u2019t have the heart to tell her, you are dressed inappropriately. She wears bathing suits fit for a size 00 and her stomach looks huge and it just doesn\u2019t fit. It\u2019s all just so unflattering. I think she only looks at herself from the front and has no idea her side profile is very unflattering in the things she wears. \n\nShe does, however, FREAK out at the way she looks in pictures. I took some photos of her at a wedding a few months ago (she was wearing a tight dress) and she snapped at me that I was making her look bad. She pulled my mom aside and genuinely asked her, do I look fat in this dress?? I think she seriously doesn\u2019t know. Someone asked if she was pregnant and it got back to her at the same wedding. She was confused and laughed it off, not thinking at all that she does look pregnant. \n\nI\u2019m debating finding a way to tell her she is dressed inappropriately\u2026or is it her thing to find out herself??\n\nEdit: selfishly, I find it embarrassing to be around her. She gets looks from strangers and is unaware. I can see my parents guests up and down her and judge. I\u2019m more of a socially aware person than she is so she has no idea.

I 100% promise she knows that her clothes fit differently. Truly, she knows. Again, let me repeat that because you have asserted otherwise, but she already knows her size. You would be a big asshole to say anything. Maybe try looking at her (beautiful, I'm sure) curves, smile, personality, see all the postives, and quit being so judgy about whatever size she is. Because it doesn't matter if she's 400 lbs.", "Because this has literally nothing to do with your sister.  This is 100% a you issue.  YTA.  Please look inward and ask yourself why you are embarrassed by the way someone else dresses/looks.  Why you feel the need to comment on someone else\u2019s body.

She's a grown adult who can make her own choices, and I guarantee you she's not unaware of her body. She probably doesn't care about what other ppl say about her.

I am concerned for her mental health when someone at a wedding asks if she\u2019s pregnant and she hears about it.

You can be fat and have a smaller chest.", "OP maybe thin but she doesn't understand grammar. I'd rather be fat than an idiot.", "Attractive", "But his issue isn't that her clothes are sizes too small or don't cover her appropriately, his issue is that he can easily see her gut. That's fully his issue and not hers, so if she's comfortable in the clothes she's wearing and is making sure she's not flashing anyone, it sounds like she doesn't need clothes.", "My cousin has NO boobs and she\u2019s much bigger than me and I have huge boobs. Fat distributes strangely sometimes.", "It is in fact possible to see that someone\u2019s clothes are too small. OP clarified that the clothes don\u2019t fit.

When talking about her low-waisted jeans, sweatshorts, and tank top, he doesn't say that the clothes are too small, he says her stomach bulges out. Which, depending on weight, your stomach is going to show even if you wear clothes that are your size. If you want to hide a large stomach, you need to wear baggy clothes, but the fact that her stomach shows doesn't automatically mean she's wearing clothes that don't fit. \n\n>If you want to police people\u2019s opinions, go elsewhere because this is AITA and I\u2019m allowed my opinion\n\nDebating someone's opinion isn't the same thing as policing it-I'm not telling you you can't have your opinion or telling you to change it or anything. Also, I don't know if you're new or anything, but everyone debates opinions on this forum. I encourage you to go to a popular post, scroll through a thread that has a lot of comments, and see how ppl discuss opinions: there's usually a mix of ppl agreeing with each other or discussing different view points.", "Well we disagree because I believe OP when they say that this persons clothes probably don\u2019t fit. A larger person with a large belly can still wear fitted clothes without their stomach hanging out, the just have to know what works for their body. **Regardless, the question is not \u201cdo the clothes fit?\u201d The question is \u201cshould I tell her?\u201d**", "Like I said, it depends on the weight. If she's only a little overweight, then yeah, it would be easier to hide. But if she's got a big stomach, wearing clothes in her size isn't going to hide a big gut. They could hide the *shape* of it, but not the fact that she's overweight. \n\nBut OP also mentions a lot of clothes that simply aren't designed to go over the stomach well or hide weight. Like, of course a bathing suit-which are usually tight-fitting if you're wearing a one piece-low waisted jeans, sweatshorts that are elastic in the waistband and can't suck in weight, and tank tops (which are also usually meant to be tight-fitting) aren't going to do anything to hide her weight. \n\nNow, if OP said the tank top was riding up on her stomach, yeah, that would be an indication of it not fitting. But her stomach bulge being visible under it isn't."]}
