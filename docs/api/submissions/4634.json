They were lost while in her possession - it is only polite on her end to replace them for you. If it were only once or twice, that would be one thing, but this is a continuing thing. She needs to replace what vanishes and either learn to take better care of things in the future, stop borrowing things from you, or accept responsibility.", "Thank you guys for the advice! I felt like an A making everything so monetary. We live together and I didn\u2019t want to have every item be separated into what\u2019s mine or hers.

Me and the kids are all kind of picky about cutlery, and like the way ours feel to use so always avoid the wierd ones. It's really annoying having so much cutlery we hate and so little we like left. I've asked him wtf is going on and could he please stop, but he denies he does it. I think he genuinely doesn't realize or notice himself doing it, but it's the only reasonable explanation for the mystery cutlery. \n\nSome people's brains just work differently. I love him, his brain is amazing. Yes, he loses stuff, but I wouldn't change him for the world. I'll buy my own new cutlery when I get around to it.\nNTA though, it's not an unreasonable request that she replace lost stuff. Try not to be too much of a dick about it though. I'm sure she makes up for the inconvenience in other ways!", "NTA. If she doesn't get or respect basic courtesy like this, your entire relationship is going to be an uphill battle. Do you really want to spend the entire rest of your life with this person, trying to get them to improve, when there's billions of other people on this planet that already do understand and follow the basic polite rules of society?", "Seems reasonable to me. It's not even a huge ask, utensils are rather inexpensive. This lesson is usually taught to children who generally understand after having to use their allowance money replacing something they broke. NTA.", "NTA.  She is taking forks to work and throwing them away.  No one at work is stealing forks.  She probably doesn't want to wash them.  Does she live with you or elsewhere?  I would be checking her house and car for the items as they weren't lost.", "NTA - Perhaps she'd like a box of plastic forks for whatever winter holiday she celebrates.", "NTA if you borrow something it is now your responsibility to take care of it or replace if broken or lost. She just doesn't want to waste her own money. If she continues to handle this poorly I'd rethink the relationship", "NTA.  She is taking your household items and losing them.  Forks dont just appear in the drawer, someone has to buy them.  That someone should be the same someone who lost them.  She is an ass for losing everything she borrows and even more so for calling you an asshole instead of admitting her mistakes and replacing your things.\n\nIf this is getting on your nerves you should really consider if you want to continue to live with her and deal with this.   She really just seems too immature to be living with you", "First of all, NTA.\n\nBut I am curious if they're actually lost, or if GF is a bit of a packrat and can't find so many little items because of it?  I'm hella disorganized and this sounds mildly like me", "Right. \nI once had this argument as well and he said he won't buy a new one because mine were not broken or lost, he just \"misplaced\" them and they will turn up in \"a few weeks\" for sure...\nSaid items were my only 2 scarfs and it was winter so I made him buy me a new one immediately. He was right, the others turned up. Almost 2 months later. After they did he really had the audacity to ask me to pay him back for the replacement one he bought. \n\nSo yeah even if you did neither lose or break it but make it somehow unavailable to the owner, fucking replace it or don't take it in the first place.", "People at my work", "It's not simply about the money.  She's not treating you with respect.  She's demonstrating that she doesn't care about you or your stuff.  There's a good chance she's using you.\n\nIf she has ADHD then getting treatment and working to do better would be reasonable.  If she doesn't have an issue like that or refuses to acknowledge that this behavior is a problem then honestly you should lose one more item - your girlfriend.\n\nHaving suffered through decades of marriage to someone who breaks and throws away things without caring that they're mine, doesn't make any attempt to replace them, and usually doesn't tell me they're gone and leaves me to discover it at crucial moment, it sucks.\n\nYou don't want to live this way for ten years or forty years.

My husband is always using my favorite coffee mugs, borrowing my clothes (yes, we wear the same size, but no, he does not look masculine in my coat lol) and chargers, etc, and losing or breaking them.

You lose, damage  or break something of someone else' s you replace it or pay for it.", "NTA. How do you lose sweatpants and razors?", "NTA", "NTA..

These are small items, well in the range of things that a person could genuinely misplace or forget. But it\u2019s not unreasonable to be irritated and request a replacement. \n\nI am mildly amused by the specificity of \u201csix utensils.\u201d FWIW, though, I would be absolutely miserable if I lived with someone who could be that specific. That person would also be absolutely miserable with me.", "I've lost sweatpants before, i think i ended up finding them at work about a year later.

Just grabbed another clean one daily for lunch.", "This is what thrift stores or yard sales are awesome for... Want to have real silverware at work, buy some at the thrift, so if it gets lost in the work kitchen, you don't care. Never, ever take pieces from a matched set out of the house.\n\nAnd for the win - I brought my old dishes to work (some had broken & I got a new set) as part of the company's \"green\" initiative. Instead of using disposable plates, there were actual dishes to use, clean, and put away. It spread from our department throughout the company. My coworkers loved being able to heat soup in an actual soup bowl.", "Agreed", "Autism spectrum. My husband has literally lost pants that he was actually wearing.", "There is a spoon and bowl graveyard somewhere in my home. \n\nI just stocked up on spoons and bowls from the local thrift store.

Easy foe her to say, she was losing your money. Now, when she's held accountable you're the jerk. She's wrong.", "Hey OP how did she lose pants that she borrowed?", "NTA-so here is how it can go. You can embrace her quirks. Ask her to use her own pens, cutlery and clothes and/or replace the stuff she misplaces, breaks or otherwise causes to no longer function. Or cease to be with her. It seems as though she is not doing these with malice and if you can get past that and she can deal with replacing the stuff, it seems like the problem is solved! I am *CLUMSY* to the point of the day I left for the Air Force, my mother went out and bought all new dishes because I had chipped every single one of hers. I have my own set of Churchill Blue Willow that I love more than anything, but I always miss when I put them away so even though I am extremely careful, I have chips on most of those as well. It is just how I am. I lose things, misplace items and am generally clumsy and my husband of 18+ years finds it very endearing but sometimes frustrating about me. You have to decide if it is more endearing or frustrating. Either way NTA", "I stopped lending things to one friend because she *always* have them back in worse condition or missing parts and never understood why I was annoyed. So incredibly rude and disrespectful.", "Changing at the gym is another possibility.", "My question is, how do you lose sweatpants? I keep stealing my SO's sweatpants but he keeps finding them and taking them back!", "or maybe lost in the infamous \"laundry chair\". lol.", "Did she really not understand or just pretend? I find it very selfish. NTA", "My dad would put forks in his pocket because his hands were full carrying lunch and then forget he had one and go get another fork. And my mom would find tons in the laundry.", "NTA, but dude, given that she's already shown you that she doesn't care about not only your boundaries, what things are yours, but doesn't take care of them, you're probably never going to see that new cutlery set. According to her, the person who's been stealing from you and either losing or keeping your shit, you are going to be the asshole, but really you're only the asshole if you stay with someone who has already told you they don't respect you", "NTA. If she refuses, why would you keep a person in your life who steals from you and/or just does not care that she is costing you a lot of money?", "She didn\u2019t lose those forks. She just doesn\u2019t give a shit. NTA.", "NTA", "This right here, it's the lack of respect that is the real issue here. The fact that she is taking socks from you absolutely screams that she is financially using you to bankroll her life"]}
