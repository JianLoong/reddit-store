If you borrow someone's car, you return it with a full tank of gas (or at least with as much gas as it had when you got it). It's an asshole move to not do these things.\n\nIt's sad that you have to explain this to a supposed adult. But you do. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - And I doubt the forks are getting stolen at work. She is probably just too lazy to wash them and bring them back. Who would steal a fork?!?", "NTA, but I'm not sure her paying for the items is going to totally solve the issue. How does an adult lose sweatpants? Why is she always losing things? Is there something that needs to change behaviourally or in attitude?", "NTA, why should you be the one to pay for her losing things? Asking her to reimburse you sounds weird tho, stick with asking her to replace the lost items as to not sound like you're just out to get her money and make it obvious that you just want lost things to be replaced, which is totally reasonable if she's a working adult.", "NTA, but it also doesn't sound like y'all are that compatible.", "NTA, it will teach her some responsibility", "NTA. She should buy her own work utensils. This is just basic adult shit.", "NTA.\n\nyou break / loose it you pay it.", "NTA\nYou would only be a A H if you would ask for money. But you are asking for a replacement and of course that's her job.", "NTA. \n\nShe is losing your belongings.  A decent person would offer to replace them, not call you an asshole for asking", "NTA. They were lost while in her possession - it is only polite on her end to replace them for you. If it were only once or twice, that would be one thing, but this is a continuing thing. She needs to replace what vanishes and either learn to take better care of things in the future, stop borrowing things from you, or accept responsibility.", "Thank you guys for the advice! I felt like an A making everything so monetary. We live together and I didn\u2019t want to have every item be separated into what\u2019s mine or hers. But clearly I was not able to tolerate it anymore when this has been a reoccurring thing for years. I just feel embarrassed making her pay for her own socks or pens it just sounds like immature sibling stuff. But I also can\u2019t keep replacing items that she lost that were mine no matter how small they are", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's at fault for your missing stuff.  Not only does she need to replace the forks, she shouldn't be allowed to borrow anything anymore.  She has to get  her own \"work silverware\".\n\nGood luck!", "NTA at all and she better replace those items and moving forward just tell her to buy her own things to lose, she can't \"borrow\" yours. Let's see how long it takes her to stop losing things.", "NTA. It\u2019s basic politeness that most of us are taught by kindergarten: if you lose or break something not your you have to apologize and replace it (obviously parents are responsible for the actual replacing at that age)", "Insist she replace your items and then purchase supplies of her own to lose at work.", "NTA it\u2019s time to grow up little lady.", "NTA.\n\nI would be giving my SO a goddam shopping list of all the items. Six fucking forks and it's not her fault?!

Also, aren't utensils you bring usually stored in your lunch bag? That would mean someone's going through her lunch bag to steal just a fork. That makes absolutely no sense at all.

Stuff like sweatpants could get stolen,  and reusable Covid masks could get sucked in the washer/dryer vent and not be visible/retrievable (or even dropped and slide under a machine). \n\nBut I\u2019d bet she\u2019s throwing the forks away at work accidentally.

That\u2019s just weird.", ">Yes, on buying own for work.  If she's really cheap.  Dollar store has very cheap utensils OR go to local thrift shop and buy some(distinctly different than those used in home) that way it's easy to keep them in a container on the counter for her to grab on way to work.", "She should always be paying for her own socks and pens.  She is an adult--that's what adults do.  \nMind if I buy a PACK of pens, I'll ask if other(/s) needs a couple. But that too is a choice not their demand", "Perfect solution"]}
