She is basically an adult and entitled to her privacy. Huge red flags flying all over the shop with this guy.", "NTA - this sounds like a deliberate power play on his part that your poor daughter won't even be able to use her phone without him being around, while he can use it whenever he likes.\n\nHow would that help her if she's out on her own and needs to contact you guys in an emergency? He's essentially given her a very expensive brick, and for no good reason\n\nI think you need to return your husband to the spouse store and get yourself an upgrade", "NTA\n\nHow is he teaching her anything? She might need to use her phone during emergency but she won't be able too because guess what her father won't be there. So what is the use of it? For him to control when she uses her phone?", "I\u2019m not sure what the point of a mobile phone is if the supposed owner of the phone must be in proximity to someone else in order to unlock it. Also, if you and your husband are agreed that he is \u2018the breadwinner\u2019, then the money he brings in is family money. \n\nWorking on the assumption that your daughter found this \u2018gift\u2019 as useless as anyone else in the world would have, you are NTA. Given your husband\u2019s behaviour (buying a phone and making it useless to the user, playing dominance games around income, and giving you the silent treatment) I think it\u2019s clear who is.", "NTA, and I would like to point out that a part of your husband's concern is that your 17 year old, ie a hairsbreadth from fully adult, daughter will be \"rebellious\". I have never known a rational, non-abusive, parent who talked like that. I also cannot imagine a teenager that old not having their own phone in 2023. What's his plan, for her to have no autonomy until she moves out and then expect her to suddenly know how to do it all? I would take stock of your husband's relationship with you and the rest of the household and ask yourself if he's routinely this controlling.", "NTA, so your daughter got an expensive log, that transforms to phone near him.... \n\nI think that limits her freedom way way wayyyy too much", "info: is he controlling about other things? Does he get angry about other issues as well?\n\nBecause it's hard to imagine this is just about a phone out of nowhere. A phone a person can't use is.... useless.", "Is your husband OK in the head? If she can't unlock it without his face what use does the phone have?", "NTA. She can\u2019t use the phone unless his phone unlocks the screen? How is she supposed to call either of you if, for example, she\u2019s out somewhere and needs you to pick her up? She can\u2019t be irresponsible or rebellious with a phone she can\u2019t actually use. It would just sit in her pocket or bag like a useless brick of plastic. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s very controlling of him to insist on such a small thing. That\u2019s worrying.", "NTA. Your husband is creepy as fuck, controlling, and abusing you and your daughter financially.", "So... He bought himself a phone?\n\nHe needs to go out into the world and ask some other men if this sounds like a reasonable thing to do.

Your husband sounds like a real AH and your marriage sounds one-sided.

You daughter deserves privacy at 17.", "NTA, is he typically this controlling? Your daughter is 17 and deserves her own phone and privacy. I don\u2019t like the way he claims it\u2019s all \u201chis money\u201d either. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s from his paycheck - you\u2019re a SAHM and his wife. You are an equal partner and parent, you deserve better. Your daughter certainly deserves better.", "NTA. \n\nI can understand doing this if she was a young toddler. I have to open my toddlers tablets. But at 17??? She shouldn\u2019t have to be treated this way. Calling her irresponsible is only going to put her down.. let her learn responsibility by having her own phone. Anytime she wants to send a text or make a call she has to have him unlock it. What\u2019s the point??", "So weird. What is the point of giving her a phone if she has to use his face to unlock it? Hey dad come here I need your face to unlock my phone?

If you are a SAHM you are entitled to the money too. Why are u being treated as a child? It's your daughter, your thoughts matter.", "So what is she suppose to do with a phone that she cannot access unless his fucking face is nearby ? Hammer in loose nails ?

Your daughter deserves privacy and to be taught dependency. Given how her dad blocked her by putting his face for the password I can see why she is so irresponsible\n You two treat her like a little kid still. You two as parents never gave her responsibility independence brings. Start treating her like an adult and maybe she will not make any major mistakes when she's on her own.

This doesn\u2019t make any sense. Using Face ID to unlock the phone so only he can unlock if makes it essentially useless to her.

Then explained your reasoning to your husband and worked with him to find an alternative solution to whatever his issue is with your daughter using the phone.\n\nIf your husband really is that controlling, awful and cannot be reasoned with\u2026 consider whether you are doing your daughter and yourself any favours by sticking around\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This man is so insanely controlling he won't let his daughter have a cell phone she can access on her own accord? And she's 17, so it's not like some weird safety measure for a young child. There's no way this man isn't equally controlling in other aspects of both his daughter's and wife's lives.\n\nPlus it sounds like there's some financial abuse going on. I think either OP's husband prefers her not to work so that she feels stuck in this marriage, or she's a SAHM and he has made it clear that her contributions don't count for anything to him. Probably both, actually. He clearly views the money and decisions as being solely his.\n\nI hope this is the wakeup call that OP needs to realize that this is unacceptable.
