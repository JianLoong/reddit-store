Whether it\u2019s a service dog or not what parent allows their kid to run after a strangers dog?", "NTA\n\nParents shouldn't let their kids run about as they please. It's a mall, not a daycare.", "NTA..\n\nI saw in a comment that you're 17, I would say maybe the only thing you could have done differently was try telling the kid nicely \"my dog is working right now, so you're not able to pet him\"..\n\n however,  we've all seen the stories of service dog handlers trying that and it gets them nowhere, or suddenly the starry eyed parent snaps out of their stupor and say something stupid like \"oh its fine, just let my little crotch goblin pet your dog\" \n\nIt seems like you did what you thought was best by turning and walking away immediately,  only to still be chased down by sticky fingers Mcgee and their NPC acting parent. At that point, yelling was probably your only option.  It stopped the kid for long enough and it snapped the parent out of it so they could finally, ya know, parent their child. \n\nParents have really got to pay attention to their kids, especially in huge, busy public places like malls. Today the only bad thing that happened was their kid got yelled at, tomorrow it could be the kid getting hurt by playing on something they shouldn't,  or someone snatching them up, or any number of situations.", "NTA.\n\nYou tried to get away and the kid kept following you. The parent did nothing. You eventually told the child to stop in a high stress situation. You purely reacted. The parent was probably only mad because you made them actually do something call parenting.", "NTA \n\nIf the parent isn\u2019t gonna stop their kid from going after your service dog, someone has to.", "NTA\n\nPeople are idiots and refuse to control their crouch goblins.", "NTA \n\nI roared at a cat that was in my yard.   It ran home. \n\nI probably would have roared at that kid, too.  \nNot the best solution but it would have worked.  Probably should roar at the woman instead of the kid.   It's her fault.\n\n(The cat makes my dogs all excited, goes after the quail in our bushes, and shits in our yard.   I understand how cats work.   It's their nature, but I still don't want it in my yard.  \n\nService dog or not, no parent should let their kid, especially very small child, try to interact with a strange dog.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA - i would have told the gremlin off way sooner. Your service animal is working.", "NTA. It's common knowledge not to interact with service dogs. If the parent isn't going to parent their child when they are putting you in danger by trying to interfere with your medical aid, you 100% are not in the wrong for yelling at a child.\n\nI don't know what service your dog provides you, but all I can think about is how dangerous this would be for a guide dog user.", "NTA. Service dogs are working dogs and need to be left alone. Why is this such a hard thing for parents to teach their kids? Or at the very least prevent their kids from inadvertently harassing the service dog & it\u2019s person?", "NTA but... If you take your service dog out often this and other common situations is going to happen often, so you should work on some strategies for how to deal with it in a firm but kind manner.", "NTA\n\nHopefully it was a learning experience for the kid", "Nta", "NTA. It was necessary", "I would say NTA.\n\nBUT it's probably not a good idea to yell at random strangers kids. People can be... unpredictable. Especially when you're yelling at their very small children. Maybe try talking next time instead of going straight to yelling.", "NTA and I'm proud of you, both for speaking up and for not slapping the parent for being an enabling ass.", "NTA but not the best reaction.. when training a service dog; you\u2019re both in training, kids are going to chase you, and try to touch your dog, you train with distractions. Your conversation should\u2019ve been with the parent.. \u201chey my dog is working, can you please make sure your child understands that he can\u2019t play with her\u201d \nEvery training session will bring on new distractions and that\u2019s how your dog will learn. From my time training, I\u2019ve learned that dogs sense anxiety and discomfort in their handlers. The mall is a hectic place to train also", "YTA, but only a little. The parent was clearly 98% of TA in this encounter, but I\u2019m assuming the child was too young to know better and yelling at the child was a little mean. Ideally, you would have firmly told the parent that the dog is a working service dog and the child needs to leave it alone. If the parent doesn\u2019t do anything then, they have only themselves to blame if your next move is to yell at the child.", "YTA, kids don't know what service dogs are, you should have shouted at the parents if you really thought it was necessary to raise your voice\n\nIf you were really training your service dog then training it to ignore common distractions - Like children, seems like a benefit anyway", "YTA. Yell at the parent, not the child. Kids don't know any better when they're that small and it wasn't causing any harm to you or the dog.\n\n\nEdit: also, part of training a service dog is training them to ignore distractions anyway.", "YTA. Can you not just turn to the parent and clarify that it\u2019s a service dog? How did you settle on \u201cscream at a small child\u201d first?", "NTA but u could have been nicer bout it telling her his working plz leave us alone and if tht didn\u2019t work than go off on the parent not the kid they don\u2019t know any better", "ESH, you are a grown ass adult you should know better than to yell at a child for wanting to interact with a cute animal, idk what compelled you to firmly decide on lashing out at a kid instead of just telling the parent to get them to stop.\n\nSimilarly the parent should have been more active in controlling their kid especially if it hinders someones service dog, really the kids the only blameless one here for just acting like, well, a kid.", "YTA, yell at the parents not the child for being a child and acknowledge the fact that kids love animals and don\u2019t understand what a service animal is and/or probably read the harness and train your dog on how to interact with kids because shouting at them is probably gonna make your dog see kids as a threat.", "NTA, the parent should have been doing some training too!", "NTA\n\nThe parents should have stopped the kid *the first instance* it startet screaming \"doggy\". Wth were they thinking?? Not all dogs are friendly with kids and yours was on duty! I believe it has such a \"service dog\"-vest? Only thing i could take you for not doing right: only focusing on the kid. Next time, directly speak to the parents. The kid was maybe too young to really understand (or care) what you wanted. Try \"Hey parents of the kid in the blue jacket, stop it from harrassing me and my dog!\" Important: directly adress *them* by describing the kid!", "NTA - the parent should have controlled their child especially in a public place like the mall", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s only so much a person can take, with all the nonsense handlers get in public, we\u2019re bound to snap at some point.", "The only A here was that lazy parent! You don\u2019t allow a child to approach a strange dog no matter what the circumstances! As a parent you have no idea of that dog is friendly or working etc. the only thing I would have done differently is talk to the parent not the child.

Phhh", "Crouch goblins makes me think of scuttling crabs", "I'm going to try roaring at my own kids the next time they act up to see if that helps. \n\n\nSeriously though OP, 100% NTA.

The problem was chasing and screaming.", "Scaring the wrong dog (like by screaming and running) can get it to bite, which means scars for the kid and the dog possibly being put down.

Control your child\n\nI was walking my K9 and a mother asked if her kids could pet him. While he is not aggressive unless asked, I\u2019ve seen what dogs do to kids when they get stressed so I politely told her no. She insisted that they would be gentle and I just replied with \u201cIf you want my dog to rip your kids fucking arm off feel free to have them try and pet him.\u201d She didn\u2019t like that, told me she would call the cops and report me. Just laughed walked away. Some people don\u2019t get you can\u2019t just run after animals and that not every dog wants to be touched by strangers.", "NTA... child needed training and possibly a leash. But this is more on the parent then child", "NTA yelling at children isn't wrong per se, especially in this situation. Although it makes you feel guilty sometimes.", "NTA but only barely. I have a service dog myself and I know that stress/fear of someone approaching my dog wanting to do pets. But the thing is that there are ways to handle these situations better and that will make your life a lot less stressful. Plus, if you got your dog through an organization, yelling at the wrong person can mess things up with them. So! I have tips. \n\nTry to avoid raising your voice if you can. I don\u2019t know what tasks your dog provides for you, but you shouting can throw them off and can stress them out. The leash is a pretty intense connection! Instead, start with simply stating things to the child like \u201csorry, he\u2019s working and can\u2019t play\u201d or calmly call out to the parent. \n\nGood thinking in \u201clet\u2019s get the dog away\u201d but you did end up needing to address it. If you have to stop, I always find I feel better if I can put myself between my dog and whatever person is coming at him. For me, this allows me the confidence of knowing he\u2019s watching my back and the comfort of knowing someone has to get through me first to get to him. \n\nFood! If there\u2019s a big distraction or safety hazard that you really want your dog to ignore, a handful of his base treats or some nice power/high value treats in your closed hand in front of his nose works as an excellent lure. I get that handful of kibble and I swear his nose does not stop touching my hand even if a bomb went off. \n\nChange location. You were doing that to a degree, in that you kept walking away, but turning into a store would have helped. A parent is a lot less likely to let a child follow a stranger into a store than a straight pathway. \n\nNow, this tip isn\u2019t about this situation, but it\u2019s a good one. If you use a head harness, you\u2019re more likely to get one of these- \u201cdoes your dog bite?\u201d I learned the hard way that saying no right away leads to idiot adults trying to pet him despite his vest and its patches. Lead instead with things like \u201cthe harness helps him stay focused while working\u201d or \u201cwell, he\u2019s working right now, so he\u2019s on his best behavior.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll admit, sometimes, I gotta get firm. I had this old guy not even look at me at all, just started trying to lure my dog to him. I gave a cheerful \u201csorry, he\u2019s working!\u201d This guy doesn\u2019t even look at me. Keeps trying to lure my boy. I dole out more treats because my dog isn\u2019t moving from my side and I bodily step between this man and my dog. I say \u201csorry, he\u2019s working.\u201d This time, firm, no nonsense, with a frown. I don\u2019t move or relax until he stops. Guy pouted at me and I moved on. \n\nDon\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been working with your dog, but it gets easier with time. I\u2019ve been working with mine since 2019 and I still learn new stuff all the time!", "NTA. The adult with the child should have done something with the child--explained about service animals if the child could grasp the concept, walk away with the child if that didn't work.", "Not only are you NTA, but what parent would let their child run after a stranger and their dog??", "NTA, \n\nThis is a clear example of bad parenting. Whenever I did something embarrassing as a toddler, my mum would quickly try to reprimand me to save face lol.\n\ne.g. I called a Muslim woman wearing a burqa 'Ninja'.", "YTA.   \n\nJust in general, yelling at some strangers kid is a bad call. Are the parents at fault? Absolutely, but the normal thing to do would have been to ask the parents to get their kid.", "If I had an award you would get it! I just spat a mouthful of cola over my phone.", "Op had been basically running away from a squealing kid, you have to expect some reaction.
