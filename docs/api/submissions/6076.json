Whether it\u2019s a service dog or not what parent allows their kid to run after a strangers dog?", "NTA\n\nParents shouldn't let their kids run about as they please. It's a mall, not a daycare.", "NTA..\n\nI saw in a comment that you're 17, I would say maybe the only thing you could have done differently was try telling the kid nicely \"my dog is working right now, so you're not able to pet him\"..\n\n however,  we've all seen the stories of service dog handlers trying that and it gets them nowhere, or suddenly the starry eyed parent snaps out of their stupor and say something stupid like \"oh its fine, just let my little crotch goblin pet your dog\" \n\nIt seems like you did what you thought was best by turning and walking away immediately,  only to still be chased down by sticky fingers Mcgee and their NPC acting parent. At that point, yelling was probably your only option.  It stopped the kid for long enough and it snapped the parent out of it so they could finally, ya know, parent their child. \n\nParents have really got to pay attention to their kids, especially in huge, busy public places like malls. Today the only bad thing that happened was their kid got yelled at, tomorrow it could be the kid getting hurt by playing on something they shouldn't,  or someone snatching them up, or any number of situations.", "NTA.\n\nYou tried to get away and the kid kept following you. The parent did nothing. You eventually told the child to stop in a high stress situation. You purely reacted. The parent was probably only mad because you made them actually do something call parenting.", "NTA \n\nIf the parent isn\u2019t gonna stop their kid from going after your service dog, someone has to.", "NTA\n\nPeople are idiots and refuse to control their crouch goblins.", "NTA \n\nI roared at a cat that was in my yard.   It ran home. \n\nI probably would have roared at that kid, too.  \nNot the best solution but it would have worked.  Probably should roar at the woman instead of the kid.   It's her fault.\n\n(The cat makes my dogs all excited, goes after the quail in our bushes, and shits in our yard.   I understand how cats work.   It's their nature, but I still don't want it in my yard.  \n\nService dog or not, no parent should let their kid, especially very small child, try to interact with a strange dog.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA - i would have told the gremlin off way sooner. Your service animal is working.", "NTA. It's common knowledge not to interact with service dogs. If the parent isn't going to parent their child when they are putting you in danger by trying to interfere with your medical aid, you 100% are not in the wrong for yelling at a child.\n\nI don't know what service your dog provides you, but all I can think about is how dangerous this would be for a guide dog user.", "NTA. Service dogs are working dogs and need to be left alone. Why is this such a hard thing for parents to teach their kids? Or at the very least prevent their kids from inadvertently harassing the service dog & it\u2019s person?", "NTA but... If you take your service dog out often this and other common situations is going to happen often, so you should work on some strategies for how to deal with it in a firm but kind manner.", "NTA\n\nHopefully it was a learning experience for the kid", "Nta", "NTA. It was necessary", "I would say NTA.\n\nBUT it's probably not a good idea to yell at random strangers kids. People can be... unpredictable. Especially when you're yelling at their very small children. Maybe try talking next time instead of going straight to yelling.", "NTA and I'm proud of you, both for speaking up and for not slapping the parent for being an enabling ass.", "NTA but not the best reaction.. when training a service dog; you\u2019re both in training, kids are going to chase you, and try to touch your dog, you train with distractions. Your conversation should\u2019ve been with the parent.. \u201chey my dog is working, can you please make sure your child understands that he can\u2019t play with her\u201d \nEvery training session will bring on new distractions and that\u2019s how your dog will learn. From my time training, I\u2019ve learned that dogs sense anxiety and discomfort in their handlers. The mall is a hectic place to train also", "YTA, but only a little. The parent was clearly 98% of TA in this encounter, but I\u2019m assuming the child was too young to know better and yelling at the child was a little mean. Ideally, you would have firmly told the parent that the dog is a working service dog and the child needs to leave it alone. If the parent doesn\u2019t do anything then, they have only themselves to blame if your next move is to yell at the child.", "YTA, kids don't know what service dogs are, you should have shouted at the parents if you really thought it was necessary to raise your voice\n\nIf you were really training your service dog then training it to ignore common distractions - Like children, seems like a benefit anyway", "YTA. Yell at the parent, not the child. Kids don't know any better when they're that small and it wasn't causing any harm to you or the dog.\n\n\nEdit: also, part of training a service dog is training them to ignore distractions anyway.", "YTA. Can you not just turn to the parent and clarify that it\u2019s a service dog? How did you settle on \u201cscream at a small child\u201d first?", "NTA but u could have been nicer bout it telling her his working plz leave us alone and if tht didn\u2019t work than go off on the parent not the kid they don\u2019t know any better", "ESH, you are a grown ass adult you should know better than to yell at a child for wanting to interact with a cute animal, idk what compelled you to firmly decide on lashing out at a kid instead of just telling the parent to get them to stop.\n\nSimilarly the parent should have been more active in controlling their kid especially if it hinders someones service dog, really the kids the only blameless one here for just acting like, well, a kid.", "YTA, yell at the parents not the child for being a child and acknowledge the fact that kids love animals and don\u2019t understand what a service animal is and/or probably read the harness and train your dog on how to interact with kids because shouting at them is probably gonna make your dog see kids as a threat.", "NTA, the parent should have been doing some training too!", "NTA\n\nThe parents should have stopped the kid *the first instance* it startet screaming \"doggy\". Wth were they thinking?? Not all dogs are friendly with kids and yours was on duty! I believe it has such a \"service dog\"-vest? Only thing i could take you for not doing right: only focusing on the kid. Next time, directly speak to the parents. The kid was maybe too young to really understand (or care) what you wanted. Try \"Hey parents of the kid in the blue jacket, stop it from harrassing me and my dog!\" Important: directly adress *them* by describing the kid!", "NTA - the parent should have controlled their child especially in a public place like the mall", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s only so much a person can take, with all the nonsense handlers get in public, we\u2019re bound to snap at some point.", "The only A here was that lazy parent! You don\u2019t allow a child to approach a strange dog no matter what the circumstances! As a parent you have no idea of that dog is friendly or working etc. the only thing I would have done differently is talk to the parent not the child. Maybe say \u201chey can uoh control your kid, my dog is working and the kid is distracting them!\u201d If that was ignored then tell the kid to do one \ud83d\ude02", "Yta. Address the parent. Don't scare the kid because it was acting like, well a kid.", "ESH (not including child and dog). The parents should have done something, but the kid didn\u2019t know any better and did not deserve to be yelled at.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The kid was not harassing you - it was excited and poorly supervised by the AH parent. You should have yelled at the parent instead.", "YTA, you have a mouth, so proclaim this dog is currently in service\n\nHard? Phhh", "Crouch goblins makes me think of scuttling crabs", "I'm going to try roaring at my own kids the next time they act up to see if that helps. \n\n\nSeriously though OP, 100% NTA. My oldest knew by age 3-4 that a vest meant \"doggy working\". She just turned 10 and still checks in with me if a dog has clothes on before she asks the owner to pet, just to make sure the puppy sweater isn't actually one of the service dog vests.", "Because the parent was very pretty far away, and the fastest thing to get the kid away from me and my dog would be what I did rather than waiting for the parent to catch up and do something. I\u2019ve have a friend who service dog eyes have been poked and tails pulled by kids. Not exactly trying to justify just giving my reasoning in the moment.", "I really should\u2019ve specified this in the post but I am not a grown adult I am 17.", "If the parents won't parent, getting yelled at by a stranger isn't the worst way for a kid to learn. Especially something as innocent as \"Hey, go away!\" (Yes, I have kids.)", "I think that\u2019s a completely different kind of problem \ud83d\ude2c", "I understand your reasoning, but you could have instead said sternly, \u201cdon\u2019t try to pet my dog, he doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d or something along those lines. If your first reaction to a small child in public is screaming at them, you\u2019re an asshole.", "You are still older than that kid and old enough to know when not to lash out at one, the kid wasn't hurting or pulling the dogs hair were they?", "So your brain\u2019s not fully developed, fine. Like someone else said, good practise for the dog, kids (and adults) and other dogs will happen, are you gonna yell at everyone who doesn\u2019t take a hint? Find out how to properly deal with these scenarios, probably not involving yelling. ESH (everyone being you and the other parent). \nAs for the kid, what\u2019s the worst that\u2019s happened, they\u2019re afraid to chase strangers with dogs now?", "The problem wasn\u2019t petting.  The problem was chasing and screaming.", "Scaring the wrong dog (like by screaming and running) can get it to bite, which means scars for the kid and the dog possibly being put down. Yelling at the kid is definitely better (although it\u2019s the parents who should be yelled at for not keeping the kid under control).", "Yea obviously but it\u2019s easier to communicate that way to a small child. My point is don\u2019t start out screaming you look like a weirdo", "But NTA, still.  Just shouting go away isn\u2019t a big deal.", "Idk what terminally online stuff this comment section is but what matters in these small random cases is how you are expected to act as a member of society; almost everybody is gonna view you as an asshole for comin out the gate screaming at a kid in public", "And they'd view OP as even more of an asshole if the dog growled at or bit the kid because it got scared by the kid screaming and chasing. \n\n\nIf they were saying they touched the kid, ok yeah, keep your hands to yourself unless it's life or death, but yelling is fair game when you need to stop a stranger's child from doing a negative thing that directly impacts you and honestly isn't the safest for them either.", "You are right. The parents need to wrangle up their spawn so it doesn\u2019t interfere with the rest of society."]}
