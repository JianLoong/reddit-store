Tiny is what she was taught is loveable. \n\nAnother example is I recently had a friend tell me she \"never thought of me as fat growing up\". The context was me laughing about the insane standards of the 2000s and how crazy it was that young, slightly chubby me thought I was an ogre at that time (I'm way bigger now). Her comment frustrated me because I don't find it kind, I find it a denial of reality. I *was* viewed as fat in the 2000s at 140 pounds, that's what the culture was, and I was considered one of the fat kids at school. I have real life evidence and memories of people calling me so - including her! To deny that is to deny my experience.

First, I do have some problems with negative self talk, so he's not always sure when it's negative self talk or just realism here.  And I think he's afraid it'll veer into negative self talk. I also think maybe he thinks that I think (sorry that's a lot of thinks) that I'm fatter than the average American.  I'm not.  But as a country, we're overweight. I don't think, comparatively, that I'm bigger than the people around me.
