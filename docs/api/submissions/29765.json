It's just a fat slob being a PITA and emotionally abusing/controlling his spouse. Like, who says that?? \ud83e\udd23\n\n**NTA** to the max!", "right? like I\u2019ve been the victim of years long gaslighting that took years to recover from  and when someone claims gaslighting bc someone told them they were mistaken it drives me nuts", "although at least here OOP\u2019s husband is in fact being emotionally manipulative and is trying to control her and what she eats so at least it\u2019s not like someone claiming something normal to do is gaslighting and there is actually something awful being described", "Yes.  I actually just wanted to type out the audacious \u201cdeep-fried battered twinkies\u201d part because I remember the first time I heard that and am still in disbelief.", "I know I should've guessed that, but some part of me wanted to believe the other was true.", "How tall are you?", "Then I apologise but still humbly stand by my verdict. You shouldn't be throwing insults at each other.", "But so is she for calling him fat \ud83e\udd37. Hence my original comment.", "I mean, if you want to try it you can report back", "5\u2019 4\u2019\u2019", "She didn't insult him. She pointed out his hypocrisy by stating a fact. He was controlling and rude.", "Him trying to control what she eats is more of an asshole move"]}
