Ages 17,14 and 9. They\u2019ve all gone to the same elementary school. My 14 year old is Tanara and my 9 year old is Tamyah. Tanara was diagnosed with cancer in 5 grade, her teacher at the time, Ms. M set up a fundraiser for her with some parents in her class. I was very thankful to her although I didn\u2019t know her very well.\n\nAnyways my younger daughter Tamyah has 2 best friends Aarschni and Katie, they\u2019ve been friends since pre k. Aarschni has been staying with us for a few days while her mom is on a work trip. Earlier today I got a call from her mom asking if I could pick her up from school because she threw up. I did and when I got there Katie and Tamyah were with her and told me that they were walking back to class after getting something from the office and then Aarschni started throwing up in the hallway completely randomly. It happened to be right outside of Ms. M\u2019s room.\n\nMs. M came out to yell at them about being quiet in the hallway and then immediately Katie and Tamyah asked her for help. Then she rolled her eyes, went inside her classroom and then came out, handed Katie a roll of paper towels and said she\u2019d call the nurse and then walked right back to her classroom. They were shocked and stayed there and waited for the nurse. BTW none of them knew who ms. M was and just regarded her as \u201cthe 5th grade teacher\u201d\n\nWhen they told me this i immediately called Aarschni\u2019s mother to ask if she wanted me to talk to the school about it and she said yes definitely and that she would call them later if I didn\u2019t want to. But I went to the main office with Katie and Tamyah and reported what happened. The checked the security footage and showed it to me and sure enough what they said was true. Not even making sure she was okay. She just had 2 9 year olds attempt to clean up the other ones vomit while she cried. \n\nThey called the teacher down to the office immediately and I left. About an hour ago Ms M Facebook messaged me and told me that she has vomit phobia or something and couldn\u2019t deal with it and said after all she\u2019s done for my family it\u2019s ridiculous that I reported her for some strangers kid. I also want to add that there\u2019s 2 teachers in every classroom(she didn\u2019t even tell the other teacher in the room) but if she really cared she could\u2019ve asked the other teacher to go deal with it. I just think it\u2019s unprofessional for someone choosing to work with little kids to let that happen, if she was a Highschool or even middle school teacher I\u2019d feel differently but these are 9 year old kids and she\u2019s an adult. Maybe I am an Ahole but even after I found out who she was I didn\u2019t feel much remorse about informing the school.

I will say that in my district we can cover vomit with something but they don't want us or students to clean it up. While I don't have an issue with vomit (I'm also a Mom. Dealing with vomit is necessary.) I do have a colleague that can't be around vomit or they throw up themselves. So that big aversion to vomit is a real thing to some people.

Procedure for cleaning up vomit usually entails rubber gloves and cleaning solutions to ensure surfaces are sterile and in many if not most schools is done by janitors, not leaving children with paper towels to handle it alone.", "NTA. And Aarschni isn't some stranger's kid to you!", "NTA what if all 3 kids now have a stomach virus because 9 yo\u2019s don\u2019t know how to avoid getting it on themselves. So many kinder options, just a teacher who dgaf and it\u2019s great that you called her out and advocated for the kids.", "NTA. She should never have privately messaged you. That's unprofessional and inappropriate. It's also inappropriate to message you at all, even if it was from her school email, about this since it's really between her and her principal. I would report this message to the principal ASAP.", "I would screenshot that post and report here again to the school. That is unaccceptable!", "NTA. I\u2019m a severe emetophobe (phobia of throw up) and I\u2019m just baffled why this woman is even teaching elementary if she has the same phobia. Let\u2019s face it, the younger a kid is, the less likely they are to feel it coming and find a nearby toilet/trash bin in time. There\u2019s a damn good reason I don\u2019t work around children, and that\u2019s because I have a crippling fear of sick. But even so, I\u2019d immediately go and find someone else to help a sick kid. Sounds like she had help right there, so she has zero excuse.\n\nThe icing on the cake is holding your sick kid\u2019s fundraiser over your head. WTF? She a) needs a different profession if her triggers get in the way of performing her job (or at least transfer to a higher grade where kids are less spontaneously barfy) and b) sounds like she has a bad case of Main Character syndrome.", "You need to report her comments to your principal.

Just hold onto the message in case you need it later", "Ooh but it smells Soooo good!", "This just doesn't ring true to me. 1st, whats the chances of all.3 being out of class in the hallway together? Why wouldn't the janitor clean it up?\n But #1, since when would a school show the parents footage without approval from board or lawyers, that shows a teacher doing wrong?! Come on.  And like they are going to talk to you abt another child without her parent being present?!", "This is among the worst clickbait titles I've seen in this sub.

You were literally acting in loco parentis and had an obligation to act as her mother directed you.\n\n2nd, as you point out there was another teacher(or she could have used someone to get janitor, school nurse or whatever) if she she couldn't deal with it herself.\n\nI hope child is feeling better now.", "I mean, I understand why you reported, but you are a bit of an ah for not feeling any remorse for someone who did so much for you and your family.", "NTA.

I\u2019m a teacher, and I have emetophobia (vomit phobia) and yes, sometimes kids throw up and you just have to put your big girl pants on and deal with it. I\u2019ve had children throw up *on me* and I didn\u2019t chuck a roll of paper towels at them and put them to work. I comforted them, sent them downstairs to admin with a friend and a sick bag to get their parents called, organised for the cleaners to assist with the cleanup, and THEN rushed to the bathroom and scrubbed myself for ages. \n\nIt is also highly inappropriate for a teacher to be messaging you on Facebook.", "NTA\n\nWhat you did yesterday has no bearing on what you do today.  I 100% guarantee that the fund raising was not done for the kid.  It was done to show how great the teacher was.  She did it for herself.\n\nWho you are today is who you are.  She deserved the report and more.  She abandoned the kid and her responsibilities.  Was the vomit a poisoning?  Allergic reaction?  She potentially left the kid to die while two others watched.  Teacher needs a review and see what's going on before she snaps.", "NTA. What a garbage teacher/ human. It is hilarious her saying \"after all I did for your family\" Are you now indebted for life.", "NTA does she also has a problem talking or thinking?

No you are NOT the aH .", "That's a damn biohazard and the teacher thought the best course of action was to have children clean up another's vomit without any protection?", "I had a bus driver make me clean up my own puke as a kid, and he got in BIG trouble when my mom called the school about it. Inappropriate!", "It\u2019s because OP made the story up.\n\nEdit: Mods nuked me for pointing out flaws in OPs story.", "The people who GAVE money are the ones who DID something. \n\nPressing click on a GoFundMe template is nothing.", "OP needs to send a screenshot of that message to the school too. I wouldn't be surprised if Mrs M set up the fundraiser for the praise she'd get, not to help Tanara. She seems the type.", "Maybe it\u2019s a cultural difference, but why is it so inconceivable for the student to help clean up her own vomit? I grew up with chronic nausea so I\u2019ve vomited in school a couple times, and my immediate response is to get tissues to clean up the puke. Granted my teachers were at least more sympathetic than OP\u2019s and also helped me out. I just find it strange that the comments think it\u2019s outrageous for kids to learn to help clean up their own mess (with help.

But that doesn\u2019t mean that she can expect a free pass on really bad behavior from then on.", "A teacher's priority should be for the health and well being of the child, not for making them clean up vomit.

Any bodily fluids from one person are a biohazard to everyone else.", "What worries me is the school is telling teachers who get reported who did it.... All around not good for the kids", "That's the best response to my unnecessary snarkiness. Respect.", "[removed]", "Why can\u2019t you get past the names?

Wouldn't they have been back in their classes?", "Yeah, I have a hard time believing an administrator would show a parent as well.

It doesn\u2019t have the same meaning in Dutch as it has in English. It used to be a very common Dutch boys name but with English getting more and more into the Dutch language a name like Dick is no longer in use.", "Plus it could be a diminutive nickname of a more recognised full name, or an unusual transliteration from a non-latin alphabet. It looks like there might be some phonetically similar-ish names in Ukrainian and Russian, which would obviously originally be in cyrillic.", "Dick is a name in English too. A name someone will likely get teased about and usually a nickname, but it is a name in  English too.", "Really? Never knew that! Well I learned something today. Thank you!\n\nExtra extra, maybe you think this is interesting as well.. I looked the name up on internet. It is from Germanic and Scandinavian origine. It is derived from the name Diederik (which is a more common name in the Netherlands)."]}
