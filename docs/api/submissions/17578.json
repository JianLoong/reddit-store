Velcro isn't in short supply or high demand. You didn't steal someone's only shot at having shoes they can use. Neither is a larger person than you going naked because you got the very last shirt in their size. Your friend is wackadoodle.", "NTA\n\nThese are shoes you already own.  What did she want you to do?  Go out and find someone to give them to?", "NTA. Is your friend for real? Gatekeeping velcro is a first for me.", "\"her reaction was shocking, she called me ableist and an asshole because \u201csomeone with actual accessibility problems could need those\u201d not me.\"\n\nWTF?  No one wants your months-long worn velcro shoes, dude.  NTA\n\n\"she also reacted this way when i bought a larger size in shirts because i feel more comfortable in baggy tops.\"\n\nUh, she has a problem.  She doesn't know what ableist means.  It's like, she saw it used on Tik-Tok as the worst thing a human can do, and she's applying it everywhere.  Nothing wrong with loose clothes if you feel better.", "Just to clarify, you're wondering if owning velcro shoes makes you an AH if you possess the ability to tie shoes?\n\nNTA, unless I'm missing something here.", "What?\n\nWhat is wrong with her?\n\nNTA.", "NTA ... Your friend has issues.", "**NTA.** I don't understand, do i have to give away my velcro stuff? I don't know if people want my old underwear.", "NTA, yikes what the hell happened to her that instilled this type of mind set? She's acting like you parked in a handicap parking spot using someone else's handicap pass or something.", "So she\u2019s upset over\u2026 shoes?", "NTA. You want to wear a pair of shoes that you paid money for because the old ones are falling apart.", "NTA. They're your shoes. And it's not like you stole them from someone who couldn't tie their shoes. You *were* someone who couldn't tie *your shoes*. Just wear your shoes and don't sweat it.", "NTA, your friend is... odd. They're your shoes. You already own the shoes. If you'd ripped them from the feet of a disabled child then I might understand but like... they're shoes wtf", "NTA.  Your friend is being stupid. She makes it sound like you knocked a disabled person over on the street and stole their shoes.  There's no practical upper limit on the number of Velcro Vans that they manufacture.  In fact, the more people that buy them, the more they will make.  If anything, you're helping out disabled people by helping to popularize the stuff that's beneficial to them, thereby making it more likely that stores will continue to reorder and stock their shoes. I don't know where your friend got the idea that there was a velcro shortage.", "You're definitely NTA. Sure, slip on or Velcro shoes can be a huge relief for people with accessibility issues, but they're shoes. They're for everyone. It's not like you're using a piece of medical equipment or masquerading as someone with a worse disability than you have. (I'm assuming that your wrist still gives you pain or mobility limitations? Which would in my opinion count as a mobility disability). So you're wearing shoes you bought when you had little to no ability to tie laces, with a wrist that may still act up and give you a hard time now that it's healed it makes sense to keep the shoes.", "So, let me get this straight. You want to wear your old ratty shoes more often and your friend thinks you're being an ableist? NTA. It's not like you were going to throw them away. Plus, most places (Goodwill, etc.) want \"gently worn\" clothing/shoes and won't even accept shoes in that condition.", "NTA its literally your belongings you bought them", ">her reaction was shocking, she called me ableist and an asshole because \u201csomeone with actual accessibility problems could need those\u201d not me. this isnt the first time she reacted like this, she also reacted this way when i bought a larger size in shirts because i feel more comfortable in baggy tops. \n\nThere has to be a missing piece to this story, otherwise your friend sounds insane.\n\n\nNTA based on available info.", "NTA. you bought them when you had a real accessibility problems. What does she want you to do, go up to visibly disabled people and offer them your used shoes? \n\nAs to shirts, if you feel comfortable in a larger size, you're NTA. Stores/companies are the assholes for not providing adequate stock in all sizes/adjusting what they stock to previous demand at that location. If it's second hand clothing, I'd hold off on buying it as, often, cheap and larger clothes are hard to find, meaning larger poor people end up unable to buy new stuff (once again, it's not your fault companies don't tend to stock larger clothes at affordable prices, but it's polite to keep this in mind when shopping second hand)\n\n(Edit for spelling)", "NTA and that term has officially made it on my list of things that I wish people would stop overusing/misusing completely", "NTA - Does your friend think they are running out of velcro?  That has to be the dumbest complaint I have ever heard.  You can't wear velcro shoes, which you bought because you were disabled at the time, because someone else doesn't have velcro shoes?  Really?  By her definition, we shouldn't be walking around because some people can't walk.", "NTA your friend clearly learned social justice terms from tiktok with no actual in-depth understanding of them. plus, you actually have muscle issues in your wrist and you need to use your wrist while putting shoes on so how would buying shoes that are easier to get on make you ableist?", "NTA. Oh, the great ratty filthy worn-out velcro Vans shortage of 2023. Tough times.", "NTA. Suggest your friend to go and buy some velcro vans for all those who \"need them\".", "Who wants used shoes?? NTA.", "As long as there isn\u2019t a person in front of you who you took those shoes from who needs them more, those are your shoes and you can do whatever you want with them. Accessibility is for everyone. Those shoes aren\u2019t a finite resource.\n\nNTA signed someone who is also disabled and requires all kinds of accessibility help.

So by buying velcro shoes, she thinks you're preventing other people from being able to buy that pair. Still NTA.
