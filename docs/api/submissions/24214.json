About two days ago I saw my niece (13f) there and she told me she was there for her physical exam. That was pretty much it. Soon after that interaction I saw her name on the list for an sti/std screening. She\u2019s my niece so of course I taken aback by this. I wasn\u2019t the one who did her test so I don\u2019t know what her results were, and I didn\u2019t see her leave so I didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to her. I\u2019ve been debating with myself whether or not I should tell her parents. I know there are hipaa laws in place so legally I shouldn\u2019t say anything but legality aside. I don\u2019t have any children but if I did I would want to know if my child had any reason to get tested that young. Just a week ago my sister told me that my niece hasn\u2019t show any romantic interest in anyone and she was focused on school. So I\u2019m pretty sure her parents don\u2019t know. My fianc\u00e9 thinks I should mind my own business and not say anything because it isn\u2019t my business to tell. He told me I\u2019d be an \u201csnitch\u201d and asshole for breaking her trust. Maybe my fianc\u00e9 is right I should mind my business, but I also would want to know if it were my child.

About two days ago I saw my niece (13f) there and she told me she was there for her physical exam. That was pretty much it. Soon after that interaction I saw her name on the list for an sti/std screening. She\u2019s my niece so of course I taken aback by this. I wasn\u2019t the one who did her test so I don\u2019t know what her results were, and I didn\u2019t see her leave so I didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to her. I\u2019ve been debating with myself whether or not I should tell her parents. I know there are hippa laws in place so legally I shouldn\u2019t say anything but legality aside. I don\u2019t have any children but if I did I would want to know if my child had any reason to get tested that young. Just a week ago my sister told me that my niece hasn\u2019t show any romantic interest in anyone and she was focused on school. So I\u2019m pretty sure her parents don\u2019t know. My fianc\u00e9 thinks I should mind my own business and not say anything because it isn\u2019t my business to tell. He told me I\u2019d be an \u201csnitch\u201d and asshole for breaking her trust.
