You didn't even leave a phone message? wow. just wow.\n\nFrankly, even adults out of college have the right to rest on Sunday, and choose not to talk with their parents during the weekend when they could be out having fun with plans, or resting. Also it's completely unreasonable to assume people check their email on the weekend.\n\nHe got your message and called back the very next day. That's responsible, and respectful, and definitely more than most in college.\n\nI think your ex is right that there's something not being understood about cel phones. I grew up before cel phones too, and when we just had landlines, there was healthy breathing room between the life you had outside the house, and someone's ability to contact you. Since now people have phones constantly on them, there's a different standard understood behavior that voice calls will not always be picked up, or answered immediately, and urgent messages should be by text. In the age of Cel phones, it's necessary for your son's mental sanity to have some breathing room here, especially on a sunday.\n\nCalling back the very next day is actually really responsible for anyone.\n\nBeing angry about an unreasonable expectation that anyone is 100% required to pick up a phone on a Sunday, and not listening to your ex that texting is normal for urgent messages, and then using that anger to deny your son's ability to join his family for thanksgiving is... well it's really not great.\n\nYour son had no ideas he needed to confirm a vacation this weekend, and you were the one who set up the unreasonable expectation that your son has to answer the phone on 1 specific day, namely a sunday when it's normal to rest or have plans. Then on top of that, you booked a trip for the entire family without him.\n\nyeah.

What a load of horseshit - unless you never call him just to catch up. My kids would NEVER call me back without a message.\n\n4) then he calls you on MONDAY - likely after catching up with his weekend emails, but you just shut him down. You could\u2019ve said, let me see if there are still affordable plane tickets rather than punishing him for not following your rigid rules to the letter.\n\n5) It\u2019s over a weekend and he responded in a reasonable timeframe - give him a break. YOU gave him far, far too little warning to justify kicking him out of a once in a lifetime family vacation.\n\nIt\u2019s quite clear that **you don\u2019t care if your son goes on the trip** with you or not.
