He still needs a bed set. I've been letting him borrow some of my blankets and a pillow; otherwise, he ( and I when I visit) would sleep with a fitted bed sheet and a small throw blanket. He needs proper work clothes. He ripped his work clothes months ago and has them held together by duct tape (it's his only pair of work pants). He doesn't buy himself groceries but instead gets food from work or orders food, which costs more than just getting groceries. He only has two towels, and when I visit, sometimes they are both dirty, so we either have to wash them or I shower when I get home. Sometimes, when I visit two weeks later, he still has the same (unwashed) towel that he has then used as the only one I can use. Most of his underwear and socks have holes in them. And a few other things.\n\nWe both don't make much money, and I don't expect him to buy a ton of expensive stuff for himself. But I also know he can afford everything I'm talking about. Even if he bought one thing per paycheck, he could have had all these things quickly. I've bought things to help him out, but I also can't get everything for him. With us trying to work towards living together, all of these things really make me not want to live with him. I can't afford to care for two people entirely and I don't want to live like that. I honestly make less money than he does, and still, I have groceries, bedding, live in my own place, budget my money, and have a savings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to live with him unless he's able to get all that stuff figured out, or am I just being a bit dramatic?", "created_utc": 1699771353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tejoc/aita_for_not_wanting_to_live_with_my_partner/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA but, um, why haven't you just dumped him if you can't imagine living with him, since he's clearly not making an effort to change and will alwaysbe this way?", "NTA\n\nMen need to be capable of basic adulting and self-care, and that includes having good hygiene, clean clothes, a clean house, and know how to cook basic meals. \n\nUnless he can get it together, don\u2019t live with him or you\u2019ll be his maid and chef.", "If you start to live with him, you are going to be responsible for all those things. You would basically be his mother, making sure he is fed and clean. \n\nIf that is not what you want, don't live together with him. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nNo one wants to parent their partner or live with someone who isn't showing signs of adulting at the level you are. He doesn't sound ready for a live in partner. Like if money is tight, he shouldn't be ordering in. He also should want to be able to have you over and not having basics like a clean towel for you is just thoughtless and someone who isn't used to being thoughtful in a relationship. Also, the fact he doesn't have his own bedding and is borrowing yours with no sign of buying his own is also another example of not adulting. \n\nWhy are you with him? How long have you been together? Why are you not communicating this with him?", "For a partnership it sounds a bit one sided :/", "NTA at all! \n\nI get having different standards (for me it's shoes, I buy a cheap pair and wear them until they literally disintegrate around my feet because idgaf), but this is bordering on \"unfit to live\".\n\nMoving in together is out of the question unless he gets his act together.", "He needs to be evaluated for clinical depression or some other mental issue. Immediately.", "He is not adulting. Moving in will make him continue his lazy ways. Don\u2019t do any more for him. He has to learn to take care of himself. Tell him he needs to man up.", "NTA or maybe NAH.  He doesn't sound like a bad person or anything, just someone who isn't taking the time to learn how to take care of himself on a basic level.  A live-in relationship with him isn't viable at this point.", "NTA, and don't move in with him. You make less than him and have your own place, pay for groceries, bedding, and put money in savings. He has...none of that. What on earth is he doing with his money? I get that people have different priorities, but unless he's putting ALL of that money into savings or a retirement account, I feel like something odd is going on. Sounds like you two aren't compatible - you want a partner and he wants someone to take care of him.", "Is this for real? If it is then why would you want to live with such a dirty unkempt slob. I'd wave him bye bye. People don't change so you can already see what your future would be like. Yuk!", "NTA. These are genuine concerns. If you haven't yet, talk to him about this. Make sure he understands that you're not blaming him for living like this atm, but that it's not the kind of life you want. \n\nMaybe he'll actually prove himself. My dad was kinda like this (a lot worse actually), and when his girlfriend went to help clean up his old place when he moved into hers, she was very scared and told him she didn't want that for her place and made it very clear what she was expecting. And he actually did change and has kept up his promises for at least a couple years now. He helps clean and cook and everything, he was around 60 when they met. I'm sure he'll revert right back if he ever loses her, but she keeps him in check and that's exactly what he needs. So there is hope.\n\nI'm usually not a fan of expecting your partner to change, but some changes are good and have nothing to do with personality. Some people just need a push to grow up.", " YATA: if you don\u2019t wanna move in with him just break up with him. Doesn\u2019t sound like you make a good couple anyways so just stop wasting each other time. I bet you\u2019ll figure this out eventually but save both of you some time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had a pair of sandals that i loved wearing in the summer time. I wore them to work one day. I got up from my desk to speak with a coworker. As i made a step forward, my sandal just fell apart and my bare foot stepped forward leaving my sandal in its place. This was morning time. We found some tape and 'fixed' it as best we could. At lunch i went and bought a cheap pair of flip flops just to get through the rest of the day. So embarrassing.", "I haven't heard that before!  So funny! Thanks for sharing."]}
