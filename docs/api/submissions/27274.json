What is the \"rule\" in your house about dog pee?  In ours, it's whoever sees it, cleans it BUT we also don't get our panties in a bunch over a 30-second chore if one asks the other for help.  Were either of you involved in something that was hard to pull away from for 30 seconds?  I don't get it.", "NTA - I mean, if you thoroughly washed your hands or used rubber gloves you'd be fine, but if you had things on the stove and needed to pay attention then I think it's a reasonable request to ask for help. If he was also elbow-deep in something, I can understand him saying \"hey I'm also super busy\" but being so angry he gave you the silent treatment? What am I missing...?", "NTA, asking your husband to help with something that\u2019s equally his responsibility when you\u2019re already busy is normal and doesn\u2019t warrant an angry outburst", "NTA. Even my cats won't eat if they see me clean the box right before I feed them. \n\nYou are right, it just isn't an appetizing thing to see someone do.", "Your husband didn't talk to you for *THE REST OF THE EVENING* because you asked him to complete a chore?\n\nIs he 15 by any chance?\n\nNTA.", "Is your husband eight years old? You have a dog, therefore it is your responsibility to clean it up. OP you were obviously doing something so your husband should\u2019ve cleaned it up and it should\u2019ve been as simple as that but NOOO. Your husband decides to act like a child. If it\u2019s a sanitary thing, then oh well, he can wash his hands and there\u2019s a little thing called hand sanitizer. \n\nSo obviously, NTA", "NTA - that's a completely reasonable request unless he *needs* to be actively engaged with the kids (something like a diaper change or whatever). If he's just keeping them entertained, cleaning up the mess is the priority.", "NTA. Even if you \u201cshould have\u201d cleaned it up, what he did is not an appropriate emotional response. He should act like an adult, not a child upset he was asked to do chores.", "NTA but that\u2019s a really odd thing to give someone the silent treatment", "Nta. \n\nYou were cooking. Even if you washed your hands or something depending on where the pee was. Wood or carpet flooring? It takes a bit to actually clean it up. You were cooking and you could\u2019ve burned the food if you stepped away for 30 seconds. Tell your husband that he just needed to suck it up for one day. It\u2019s not going to kill you for cleaning up pee! An ex of someone here (not mine!) would literally yell at me to clean up pee or puke. He did one time yell at me for throw away a used pad when he KNOWS I\u2019m on the pill for medical reasons so I don\u2019t have my periods. It\u2019s like dude you are PERFECTLY able to clean up pee! Let the dogs in! Anything! I had to go next door to shower and I let the dogs out. I had asked him to let them in as I was leaving. What he do. Tell my mom that I left the dogs outside when HES LITERALLY RIGHT THERE!? He could\u2019ve EASILY grabbed gloves and put a diaper on our dog! He is PERFECTLY able but is lazy to do that 1 THING!? \n\nNta! You were doing something he could\u2019ve easily cleaned it up and washed his hands. The kids will be fine for 30 seconds!", "Man stories like these just make me so sad. Men so conditioned to do jack-shit that one simple request sends them spiraling. NTA and sorry about your useless husband.", "INFO - any kind of agreement between the two of you when the dog first became part of both of your lives that he would never be responsible for cleaning up after it? I have known people who didn't want a pet, and agreed to having one in the house as long as they were not in any way responsible for cleaning up after it.\n\nIf that is not something you had agreed to, then this will be a pretty easy call.", "NTA - he could have said no. He didn\u2019t have to get pissy about it. Sounds like there are bigger issues here.", "NTA but like here in our house if something similar would happen, and I'd ask my fiance and for some reason he can't, he'd just say that. \"Sorry I can't, I'm in the middle of -thing-, can you do it?\" and then I'd be like \"Okay sure!\"  \n\n\nidk why that would be such an issue?", "Cue the word \"our\" in front of dog.  It's his dog too, his responsibility too.  A marriage is teamwork, and yes, he should have helped.", "NTA\n\nIt was a reasonable ask. If anything I think his reaction is odd and kinda childish.", "NTA. Does your husband often punish you passive aggressively, like the silent treatment?  Partners help each other out.", "NTA", "NTA. Your guests certainly don't want you cleaning dog urine and then serving them food. Your husband should have just stepped up with no discussion.", "Def NTA.  You cooking and entertaining your neighbors seems like a more time sensitive task than what he was doing, so seems reasonable for him to step up. He's TA for giving acting like a toddler and ignoring you the rest of the night.", "NTA. You\u2019re not crazy at all and he\u2019s having a complete overreaction.", "He's another capable adult in the household who is also responsible for kids, pets and cleanliness. It's not like you were sitting around watching TV and asked him to do it. Your husband is a baby A. You are NTA.", "Info? Was he preoccupied with the kids where he could not stop what he was doing?", "NTA\n\nIf your husband can't deal with a little bit of dog pee then *don't own a dog*. Pretty simple there.  You were cooking, that was a little higher priority than dealing with the kids. He could step away for two minutes to deal with some pee.", "We have to clean up hairballs and cat puke on the regular at my house. My husband and I just groan and reach for the paper towels unless we're in the middle of something. Your husband is being rude. He may have been entertaining guests and not liked what he needed to do, but you were cooking and planning a meal. He needed to be the one to do it. I bet he also got mad at you for letting it happen?", "WTF? Is he or is he not your partner? If course he should have cleaned it up! The fact that he's upset about it would have put me over the top. Does he expect you to wait on him too? NTA.", "NTA. the only way you would be is if he was explicitly against getting this dog and you said you\u2019d take care of all messes. Even then I feel like he\u2019d be pushing it", "NTA. Let me guess, you organized the get together? Did all the planning and shopping? Purchased presents and cake? Cleaned the house? Cooked all the food (we know this already)?\n\nAnd then he had the nerve to get angry to the point of giving you the silent treatment because you asked him to do 1 small little thing? Interrupting him being the \u201cfun dad\u201d no doubt. \n\nStart noticing this kind of behaviour from him, OP, create a list if you have to. This is a red flag and if he\u2019s not pulling his weight at home and acting like a spoiled brat frequently, you need to take a serious look at your relationship with him.\n\nIf it\u2019s a one-off, it\u2019s still a red flag of a reaction and I\u2019d advise you to still keep a mental note. This gives me the vibes that he thinks you \u201cembarrassed him\u201d by doing an act that is \u201cbeneath him\u201d\u2026", "NTA. He's being silly. Jobs have to be done, and the one with the least going on gets to do it.", "NTA. You were literally cooking. He can be a grown man and help out his fucking partner by cleaning up the pee. He's really whining about nothing. You did nothing wrong OP.", "NTA-if I\u2019m your neighbor, I would offer help. I don\u2019t want the cook who is going to deal with my food to deal with any of the pee or poop in the progress, even I know they are going to wash their hands obviously.", "NTA. He is acting like a spoiled brat though for giving you the silent treatment.", "Omg what a freaking baby! He's the asshole and you are NTA!", "NTA, if something gross happens related to kids or pets and one of us is actively eating or cooking they don't have to clean it up.  It's a courtesy, not a hard and fast rule though.", "NTA. He should have just cleaned it. It takes less than a minute and its really not that difficult\u2014 you asked him for help because you were busy at the moment. He honestly should learn to be a little more understanding with you.", "Something must be missing here because this scenario alone doesn't justify him giving you the silent treatment for hours after a 30 second event. Did you order him like a servant? Did he have to stop in the middle of something important? I don't think asking him to do it is wrong, but I feel like there needs to be some reason behind the \"silent treatment\" other than he had to clean up pee. Does he do this a lot or is it the first time?\n\nEdit to add: A Swiffer on hand is pretty convenient when you have to clean something like that in a hurry.", "NTA\n\nSeriously, giving you the silent treatment over this ? Is he for real ? Is he usually such a D when you ask him to do something or was it just a bad day for him ?", "NTA, is it your dog, his dog or both of your dog ?  \n\n\nWhy should you be the only one tasked with cleaning up after it.  \n\n\nWe have cats & if there is (very rarely) an accident then whoever is not busy or who sees it happen cleans it up.", "NTA. My boyfriend cleans dog pee without being asked, and it's not even actually his dog. We call her \"our dog\" because I got her after we were already making arrangements for him to move in and he was involved in picking her out and naming her and all that, but we agreed that it would be cruel to take her away from my son if we split up and I also have been primarily responsible for paying for her shots and food, so for that purpose she's mine. But he won't hesitate to clean up her messes, whether I ask because I'm busy or he's the one to find it.", "NTA. Not even sure I understand.  Doesn't *everyone* have to take a turn cleaning up after doggo? Do you two have a rule that he's \"hands off,\" because you wanted the dog and not him? That *might* change answer a bit I guess, but even there should have been an exception given the circumstances.", "When did cleaning up dog pee become your job?  Ask him if he really wants your pee stained hands making dinner.", "INFO : Has he ever changed any of your babies diapers? Or does he force you to do it all, because that's \"women's work\"? Do you do all of the cooking and cleaning in your home?", "I feel like there's got to be info missing here. Does he usually flip out and give you the silent treatment \"all evening\" when he's irritated? Did he specifcally tell you he was upset just because you asked him to clean the pee, or did other things happen that day that built up to it?", "Not sure of final vote: Unless it is 100% your dog that hates him and he hates it and you have an agreement that it is 100% on you. If it is indeed a family dog the mopping up should be whoever is closest, usually, failing that whoever is least busy. All that said, his getting angry probably does make him an AH, but what does \"busy with the kids\" entail? Regular play? Changing diapers at the time? Stopping the 2 year old from bonking the baby with the wiffle bat and telling the 4 yo to stop peeing in the fish tank?", "NTA. Husband needs to grow up!", "He\u2019s being an asshole for you not wanting dog piss around your food.\n\nTell him he\u2019s being an ass for me, from Chicago.", "NTA, your husband is though! He's making a big deal over nothing.  He can clearly see your cooking and buys so surely he should just clean it up, and not talking to you for the rest of the evening is just silly, he's acting like a baby!", "NTA, next time it happens be sure to cook him a meal and mention it to him later and see how he feels about it. My husband always hated this chore but still did it and never gave me the silent treatment for it. Your husband needs to grow up, this happens with pets and you just deal with it, it\u2019s not just your responsibility even if it\u2019s your dog.", "Your hubby is childish. You did it right . Unless you demanded he clean it. Then yta", "I think he felt like you were bossing him around company. Did u explain that u didn't wanna clean pee and then continue cooking? \n\nNTA", "Um no? NTA. How does he expect you to clean dog pee and cook at the same time? He\u2019s just angry you asked him to be a host while he was having fun.", "I\u2019m most boggled that he\u2019s still not talking to you? He seriously needs to work on his communication skills. I say this as a man who desperately needed to work on my communication skills, and still try to improve now. Shutting down and giving the silent treatment is NOT ever the answer in a relationship. \n\nAgain, I say this as someone who is still working on not doing this. However I have a lot of trauma and such, and not sure what your husband is going through. \n\nI am wondering who does the majority of cleaning/cooking in the house, or if those are shared jobs? All in all none of us can know if he\u2019s not talking about it.", "NTA, doing that with food is way worse and gross", "NTA but seriously, WTF?  Divorce time.", "NTA. Is your husband too high and mighty to clean up dog pee? Just based on that, he does not sound like a good person to know.\n\nMy wife and I share chores in our house. If a pet has an accident, which thankfully is rare, whoever is there cleans it up. I do not treat my wife like a servant by expecting her to do it, and she would not do it to me.\n\nYour husband needs a slap on the back of his spoilt little leg.\n\nAnd if that is his regular behaviour, then consider dumping him. Let him find someone else to put up with his lordly manner.", "NTA.\n\nYou are 100% right that it would probably gross out your guests to watch you clean up pee and then continue to cook, no matter how much you washed your hands. It's just bad optics.", "NTA. It seems like a reasonable request and more polite for your guests. His cold-shouldering you on the other hand was very immature.", "NTA, but why would he get so mad? Is it normal for him to get so angry when you ask him to do something so small?", "NTA. You're right that would be kinda gross.", "You need to sit him down. Look him in the eye and say NO! NO! that is not how we behave in this house. Then go and pet your dog. \\^\\_\\^", "NTA you had food on the stove, which is definitely a bit time sensitive. And it definitely would have been kind of gross to go back to cooking after cleaning up pee.\nHas he had problems with splitting chores before? Or does he have a history of problems with the dog? Because that seems to be a pretty strong reaction for what was asked.", "NTA.. as an adult and something needs done he should have just cleaned it up..", "NTA. Unless you\u2019re leaving out something important, I don\u2019t see how you could be TA here. You were busy and it doesn\u2019t sound like he was doing anything he couldn\u2019t walk away from. He should have offered to clean it up without being asked.", "NTA of course he should have cleaned it up if you were in the middle of cooking dinner", "Kind of bizarre.  Presumably you both made a decision to have kids, get a dog, throw a party etc.  If you don\u2019t want to deal with those things, don\u2019t do them.

Ridiculous. NTA.", "NTA. Your husband is lazy if he can't do something as simple as clean up dog pee. Not like it's poop.", "What a child!", " Wow! What happened to sharing chores? \n\nCooking is a very legitimate reason not to want to deal with an accident on the floor. Someone had to clean it up so why couldn\u2019t it be your husband? Yes, you could\u2019ve absolutely have just washed your hands afterwards but as you said depending on how finicky the neighbors are it might not be a good look. \n\nDoes he usually have issues with chores? Are you the one that ends up doing the majority of the chores because if you ask he\u2019ll pout like a child like he did here? \n\nIf the neighbors noticed the interaction I can guarantee you there\u2019s a high probability that they are thinking wtf is up with him that he couldn\u2019t help out?
