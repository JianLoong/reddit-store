Do you pay for him when you take him to a place you pick and can afford?\n\nIt sounds like there's a cleaning service, so it's not clear you're doing chores either.\n\nSo far, it really sounds like you're getting a good deal.  But you take what he puts in for granted because he can afford it so \"he has to pay for me too.\"   Then when he flips it around -- you have more time, so you should cook sometimes -- you're pissed.  \n\nWould you cook occasionally for yourself?  Bc it sounds like you're expecting the default to be him paying for food for both of you, just bc he can afford it.  That's a very one-sided relationship.", "Girl you have a pretty sweet deal.

It doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re really contributing to the relationship. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to say you\u2019re an asshole, because truthfully both you and your boyfriend apparently have major communication issues as well as stunted life skills.

Time is the enemy of youth and beauty and it keeps ticking away.\n\nIf you \"salary will never be close to his\", what makes you think that is even a factor?

It would be lovely if you wanted to cook for him. Obviously, you don\u2019t have to do that. So your refusal to do it and his subsequent negative to reaction to that is either just two people with mismatched expectations, or it\u2019s a manifestation that neither of you is really treating the other person with both love and respect.\n\nThese are not questions AITA can answer. As you can see, your entire relationship has been distilled down to division of labour and finances instead of the only important thing which is: are you not cooking for him because you truly don\u2019t want to cook, or because you can\u2019t bothered?

They both cover fees for the home, and they probably came to an agreement over that. She\u2019s not wanting to go to expensive places to eat, he is wanting that, and is offering to pay for it.

However, even though I have a good job I make nowhere near enough to afford his lifestyle, so he takes care of most of the expenses.

I'm asking him to literally continue his previous routine.\n\nAlso, I'm not asking for him to pay for me or take me to the places I can't afford, but since he wants to do those things together, he has to cover the costs for both of us.
