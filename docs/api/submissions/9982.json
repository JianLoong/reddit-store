There are people with EDS or fibromyalgia who have pain where people don't \"normally\" have. You can actually touch someone with these conditions softly and still cause pain. To inflict pain again, on purpose, because you shouldn't have pain there is just rude and sounds like a form of gaslighting. \n\nAnd he got an attitude with you for how you responded when he inflicted pain again, on purpose.

Does he tell you that something shouldn't be certain or people don't normally feel the way you do?\n\nPeople like your husband will only see how you wronged him, but not how he wronged you.\n\nTo cuss at you is also wrong of him.
