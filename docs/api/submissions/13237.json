We also agreed to always respect the children's wishes and not to bad mouth the other parent to them.

The only thing keeping me here are my children, so I came up with a plan and if my children were going to be okay with it, I would move. I talked to my ex-wife for her approval.\n\nMy plan was to fly back once a month to Germany to see my children. They would also have the chance to visit me in Norway during their school holidays, if they wanted to. My ex approved, I talked to my kids about it, they asked to think about it.\n\nTwo weeks later, they really shocked me. They said they were okay with my plan, but asked me to consider letting them move to Norway with me. I asked them for their reasons, and they told me. I explained to them, that this was a huge life decision to make at their age and not one easily reversible.

I also promised them to talk to her mom about it.\n\nI did my research, and it would be totally possible for them to come with me, school wise.

They had a pretty big changes in their lives. Children that young may seem to make a rash decision, but I feel that this was something brewing for a while. \n\nHonestly, you seem to be very understanding when do children wanted to stay with Mom rather than move back-and-forth, I feel like she owes you the same courtesy at least some patience. You are genuinely putting your children\u2019s first. And I think your ex need to instead talk to the children to understand why and if she could make things a lot more comfortable for them.

I think it's just too many people they don't really know and care about around, and the whole family hangs out often as large group. \nThe last reason is, they feel like they aren't the priority for their mom anymore as my ex tries to fit in with the new family (she also works full time). They have told her this, and she promised to try to do better and now reserves exclusive time just for them more often. But my kids can't shake the feeling.\"\n\nConcerning timescale and mediation:\nI can't take them out of the country without her consent and any legal proceedings to change that would likely be unsuccessful, but would take up so much time my job opportunity would go away.\nSo she'll either agree to letting them go or I'll stay here in Germany and let the children live with me, if they want to.", "I'd submit that, at 12 and 14, the kids ARE old enough to have an input.\nThe kids heard the plan, and told dad \"we don't like this plan, please rescue us.\"\nAnd dad's an ass for considering it instead of making them stay where they don't want to?\nIf mom is worried about her relationship with her kids, perhaps she shouldn't have alienated them to the point that they want to leave the country?", "He talked to the mother before the kids ask him to take them. He didn't think the kids would want, since they live with their mother. But they asked and OP should put their needs before his ex (selfish) feelings and even gosto court If needed.", "The one is the conversation we had, after they initially said they wanted to move with me. I told them to think about it. We talked about again two weeks later and they stayed firm. I said again, I would love to have them with me and if it's possible they of course can come, from my point of view. I had done the more research regarding schools and thought this was doable. But I also told them that it's not solely up to that and their mom would have to agree of course, they then asked me to talk to her. I didn't call it an offer, my ex-wife did and she's now asking me to tell the children it's not possible for them to move. I used her language in the bottom line, because the posting guidelines say, you should present both sides.", "They say just he's boring and old fashioned and not very interested in them. I've met the gut (the first time long before the move) and I think I agree. I would not want to be friends with him, if I met him under different circumstances.\n\nI did ask them to explain their reasons for not wanting to live with their mother anymore and they had good reasons, but nothing concerning. I did ask if there was anything else and they know they can talk to me about everything.", "They are old enough to have input, but it is still up to the parents to make the ultimate decision.  Dad is not TA for considering it, but he is TA for basically saying, it's okay with me unless your mom blocks it.  For that big a decision, he should have had a conversation with her before giving the kids an answer.", "Now you're being disingenuous.  You admit that you told the kids they could come live with you unless their mom said no, and then in the next breath claim you did not offer that they could live with you as long as their mom agreed.  And now she wants you guys to put up a united front that they will stay in Germany but you seemingly are digging in on throwing her under the bus by maintaining the position that they could move to Norway if not for their mother. \n\nUltimately you are within your rights to do all of this regardless of what I think about your parenting, but at least own what you're doing.", " If they want to go with you then take them , as someone else commented ,your children want a full time parent and they chose you for that they are old enough to choose who they want to live with .", "Why? He's okay with them coming, their mother isn't, is he supposed to lie to them and rescind the offer? Why should the kids live with their mother by default if they don't want to? Do you think their father doesn't want the same? Why does he have to bend to her? Why not the other way around? How do you know what is best for them? 12 and 14 is old enough to have an input. NTA", "Nope. \n\nKids say \"don't make us stay with mom.\"\n\nDad investigates, finds he can actually swing it. \n\nI'd say the onus is on mom to show the kids why she can make the home less like something they want to escape.", "Okay I feel you want to read the worst thing possible into this (feel free to do so). But I think there's a difference between telling them I love them and would of course be happy to have them with me, if everything works out (which I did) and telling them you can come with me, it's just hanging on your mother's approval (which I think you are insinuating).\n\nI didn't want to come across as if I didn't want them there or leave them, which I was feeling I was doing in that first conversation, by pointing out all the difficulties that might arise, and all the obstacles that were in the way. I wanted them to know, that they would always have a place at my side. Maybe I over corrected and did what your are saying.\nI will definitely think about it.\nThank you for your input.", "I can't just take them, that would be abduction. Either she agrees or I'll stay here and let them live with me here, if that's their wish. And my ex has to live with the fact her children might resent her for that in the future.", "If the boys will have to stay in Germany either way, do you really think it's in their best interest to be even more miserable because they resent the parent they live with most of them time?  I mean, this whole situation was set up when OP decided it was more important to him to move to a different country than to stay near his kids so he can't exactly play innocent victim here.  But it's awfully convenient that he gets to make himself the good guy here and his ex the villain.", "OP may not care for the way that conversation goes if she tells them openly and honestly the reason why she doesn\u2019t think they should move with dad.  But his own admission, OP currently only sees his kids every other weekend, which isn\u2019t exactly a high level of parental engagement.  Is OP really prepared to take on sole parenting responsibility when he\u2019s currently responsible for almost nothing?  He also apparently has difficulties integrating socially (one of the reasons he cites for the move), but if the kids move to Norway with him he would be entirely responsible for helping them integrate socially in a country where they don\u2019t speak the language, so their social engagement would be limited to what they could get OP to coordinate with other parents at the school, and their cousins.  This isn\u2019t exactly a promising situation for the kids\u2019 well-being.", "I am not talking about kidnapping I am talking about going to court. And your children surely already resent your ex.\n\nAnd sincerely it is good to know that you are willing to stay for your children.", "Why would they be miserable? Sorry but I don't follow you. Parents are persons too, with their own will and desires, he already made a compromise to see their kids after moving and told their mother, now his children want to move to be with him, he's okay with it, are they supposed to be miserable living with someone they don't want to?\n\nI don't think his ex is a villain, I just think the children are old enough to decide who they want to live with, and yes, ex is entitled to be disappointed, mad even, but as a parent you can't force your kids to do whatever you want. Dad explained the risks, the problems that may arise, they are ok with it.\n\nI don't understand how he is making himself the good guy. They already were thinking about living with him full time, and their mom is not entitled to their children living with her if they don't want to. Legally, she can block the move, sure, and their children will resent her and move whenever they are allowed by the court, so if she wants to destroy her relationship with their children, she can do that, but that's not OP's fault.\n\nShe probably (and I don't know for sure) would have complained if they wanted to move even in the same country, but her wishes don't trump their  children's or his ex's.\n\nReally sorry for ex, because I understand wanting to live with their children, but that goes both ways, so I understant OP being fine with their children living with him (and they want it too), after seeing them every other weekend.\n\nNo one is a villain, just life.", "12 and 14 yos are old enough to have an opinion, but they are not old enough to make such major decisions for themselves.  I have children those ages, and while I listen to their views on lots of things, they simply are not mature enough or experienced enough to make major life choices like this entirely for themselves.  That is why their parents are still legally responsible for them at those ages.  \n\nWe do not know the mother's side here, and for all we know there are very legitimate reasons why the children should not move to Norway that OP is not sharing and that the children do not fully appreciate.  That is why it should be a joint decision between the parents and not OP setting up his ex as the bad guy.", "Agreed that it should be a joint decision and I understand your point better now. Ex could have legitimate reasons, but one of them is not ''I want my children to live with me even though they want to live with their father''. I won't comment more on the topic since I don't know what the reasons are. \n\nStill, 14yos are listened to in court in custody cases and their opinion is used to determine where they live and the custody arrangements. I still stand by my point, and she will damage her relationship permanently with their children. \n\nTo me,  OP shouldn't lie to their children and rescind their offer, because his jugdment of the situation, for all we know, is as good as his ex. She doesn't want them to move, she can explain to them the reasons, but they are allowed to disagree, OP is allowed to disagree, and she is as qualified to know what's best for them as OP is.", "YTA... Did you research this kind of situations before talking to your kids? Children this age sure have a right to have a say in these decisions but ultimately, in Germany at least, the parents decide. If the mother is against the idea, there is no way a court would speak in your favor unless their mother and/or new partner is abusive. So you're the AH for leading the kids on without knowing for sure their mother would accept to let them go with you.", "NTA. Honestly I am uncomfortable with your wife moving a strange man into your teen daughters life/home. . Too many horror stories out there.", "NTA - the kids have a right to choose", "NTA for no other reason than you seem to be looking out for your kids' best interests and their mother certainly does not.\n\nTheir mother marries a guy who has no interest in them, moves them all into his family's house, and proceeds to ignore them to the point where they feel unimportant.  She wants you to be the bad guy because deep down she knows she already is.", "NTA. Why is it ok if you move and see them limited amount time but for her it's wrong. You already have family in Norway and your kids are old enough to make decision. I'd honestly move and have kids come stay for a long vacation and then they can truly decide if this is what they want to do and hopefully convince mom to have them permanently move with you.", "Nta  your wife was ok with having them all the time but now the kids want to go with you and she has a problem with it and all of the sudden doesn\u2019t want to respect the kids wishes.", "NTA. Absolutely make her be the bad guy.", "NTA - I might also do some more in depth talking about why they want to move. Is there something going on with mom or the new boyfriend? Not saying you aren\u2019t a valid draw, but I think there might be a reason they both want to go.", "There is potentially a third option:\n\nYou take the job, coming back to Germany to see them etc. \n\nRemind them that when they are of legal age, they can come to Norway without parental consent if they like. Which means they could finish up their school, get the hang of Norwegian maybe..", "Yeah, fairly moot point. I don't envy you this dilemma anyway, as whatever you someone will be unhappy.", "YTA. It's not okay to move your kids away from the other parent. Personally, I also thought you were TA for wanting to move away from them yourself. But moving them to another country, away from the other parent, is 100 times worse.", "NTA The kids proposed the idea to you, you didn't suggest it to them, therefore you have every right to consider it and give it a lot of thought. I would agree with your mum about taking kids away from their mum, but they want to remove themselves. It is a Germanic language too, not too difficult to grasp from German. Beautiful country. About the 7th happiest country to live in and a fantastic opportunity for the kids.", "NTA", ">Well, my ex is furious, she thinks I'm an asshole for not refusing them outright. She hasn't told the kids, she won't allow it, but wants me to rescind the offer instead. She can prevent them from leaving with me legally, but I think she knows that would destroy her relationship with the kids.\n\nSo to put it differently, she'd rather her children believe that their father is effectively abandoning them to move to Norway than believe that their mother crushed their desire to be close to their father out of personal selfishness. Yeah, that not only sounds like a **her** problem, it also sounds like she's not exactly a peach of a mom. Perhaps there's a reason they want to move *away* from her.\n\n>I have talked to some people about this and most didn't think I was 100% in the wrong, but my mother said it was horrible, that I wanted to take the kids away from their mother, which made me unsure.\n\nUnfortunately, it's somewhat common that mothers adopt this, \"a child's place is with the kid\" perspective. It's less common in contemporary times, but it still pops up often enough, and it's especially common among mothers from prior generations. In other words, no you're not the asshole just because your mother couldn't fathom not being the custodial parent in your ex's position.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You should have discussed it with her, but if she's going to block them from living with you, she needs to be the one to tell them. Otherwise it will seem like you lied and then abandoned them, which I guarantee suits her just fine.", "NTA. Do not rescind your offer. You kids want to be with you. If their mother wants to force them to stay where they dont want to be then she needs to have the hard conversation and deal with the fallout", "NTA - a Friend of mine, psychologie, was in some way in the same situation, her only son is everything, at 12 he asked her to move other side of the country with his dad, and she accepted. Even it it kind of broke her Heart, she graciously accepted. She paid child support as she made more money. And now he's 18 they have a very balance and healthy relationship. He's a brilliant student. I admire her and I think she's right. Kids are free to choose, it's not against us, it teachers them frreedom, autonomy, to take big decision and stick to them.", "NTA.  As someone who is the custodial parent, and received a really great job offer but I had to turn down because the three hour a week dad was able to block the move (even though it would have been much better for the kids as well, and they have always wanted to move where it was located because it is closer to family), I have a lot of bitterness towards family courts in this situation, because sometimes the other parent should not get to make those choices. \nIf SHE is saying no, then SHE can be the one to explain to the kids why she is blocking it.", "NTA. It\u2019s hard to co-parent. Every parent gets their feelings hurt at some point in that situation.", "NTA because this is what the kids want but you should cover the bulk of the travel costs for the kids to see their mom.", "12 and 14 is old enough to make the choice which parent you want to live with. Either way, the children will be separated from one parent, so it should be up to them which one they are okay with.", "I also think it's a great opportunity for the kids. I initially wanted to move for myself, but I think if my kids find friends and get along in school, it might be an excellent country to spend the rest of their lives in for them.", "Have you asked an attorney if it\u2019s possible to take your kids to Norway? They certainly are of an age where a court should take their desires into consideration as to where they want to live.", "Could you give up on Norway in the interests of your kids living with you in Germany? I know it\u2019s a great job and near your brother, but it sounds like your kids kinda need you. Can you get a job near where they used to live where their old friends are?\n\nETA: hello from a Brit living near Heidelberg!", "Please don\u2019t lie to make her look good", "NTA\n\nI would include this in the edit if you can.\n\nDo not rescind your offer. If your ex cares about her children, she should sit down with them and hear them out, and if she wishes to do so, after that, to convince them to stay in Germany. \n\nIf  she pleads her case and they still want to move away with you to Norway, she should do what's best for your children and agree. \n\nI hope things work out for you, OP, but I hope you don't lose out on your children moving away with you or that job opportunity.\n\nAlso, how come you have such limited custody? Is it due to work, or does your ex live that far away?", "Hard disagree. These are adult decisions. \n\nAnd them being separated from one parent is exactly what makes OP TA. Moving kids away from the other parent is, in most cases,  not in the best interests of the kids.", ">Hard disagree. These are adult decisions. \n\nWhat makea you say that? Kids are capable of doing research, reflecting on their position, making a list of pros and cons, discussing how it'll affect their present and future, etc, all in order to make an informed decision as possible. \n\n>Moving kids away from the other parent is, in most cases, not in the best interests of the kids.\n\nIf it's something forced on them, yeah. But making that choice themself changes the nature of things."]}
