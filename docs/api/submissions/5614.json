On mobile and this is a throwaway. \n\nThis year my husband (42m) and I (38f) are spending Xmas with his dad (73m) as it\u2019s the first Xmas without his mum. However it\u2019s only been a year since I lost my own dad and so I wasn\u2019t feeling too Christmassy and didn\u2019t want the full load to fall on me so we agreed we would make a simple Xmas dinner TOGETHER. This is especially important as I am a lifelong vegetarian and have no idea how to cook the turkey so he promised to take care of all of that. \n\nHowever today just as we we\u2019re getting preparations underway at 1pm for dinner at 3.30 he said he wanted to go to an AA meeting at 1.30 (on zoom). This is his preferred meeting cos he connects well with the other ppl who attend it. I was gobsmacked. Of course I want him to go to meetings and I truly want to help support his sobriety but this is right smack dab in the middle of the time he said he\u2019d be helping, and meetings take a bit over an hour so I\u2019d be basting the turkey by myself (ugh) and well as doing the potatoes and sides. So I told him no because of our previous agreement and he got mad and said I\u2019m impacting his recovery. I understand in emergencies he needs a meeting immediately but all was fine today. Maybe I should suck it up and let him go? AITA?\n\nEdit. My solution was that he go to one later on, after dinner but he doesn\u2019t think that will work. He also could have gone to one earlier, there are meeting offered all throughout the day and sometime she does an early meeting before breakfast and sometimes a later one after dinner/in the evening. I would be fine with either of those, just not the one slap bang in the middle of dinner prep. \n\n2nd edit. Just to address the valid point about how I phrased \u201ctoday is fine\u201d I did check in with him if he feels in crisis or triggered/ struggling with thoughts of drinking. He said no, it\u2019s just he likes/wants to go to a meeting every day and this one is his favourite.\n\nSorry 3rd edit. Just to be clear we\u2019re already at FIL\u2019s house, we\u2019re staying with him for Xmas. My dad is dead, just last year and my partners mother died this year so we are both quite depressed/struggling.\n\n\nFinal edit - the dinner got cooked, the turkey wasn\u2019t dry, he\u2019s going for a meeting now. Thanks for the responses, it seems quite mixed which I think reflects how complex both recovery and living with someone in recovery can be.

You\u2019ll only be following the plan you agreed to. Then do that. If the turkey is dry or burned, that\u2019s his responsibility for not rescheduling dinner or creating a new plan of action to accommodate his meeting.\n\nAlso, he\u2019s not taking responsibility for his decisions and he\u2019s manipulating you by subtly threatening his own recovery. That\u2019s disgusting. As the *former* partner of an addict I\u2019ll tell you that such manipulation indicates your partner isn\u2019t in recovery, just abstinent. He still has the manipulative, selfish and immature behavior, he\u2019s just not using.", "NTA. I'd stop everything entirely and say \"OK we'll do it all together when you're done. I'll go have a sit down until you're ready to continue\"", "I don't know what to make of this. I mean obviously his recovery and continued sobriety is very important. But wanting to join the meeting at meal prep time really should have been super predictable to him. There is something that smacks of saying what he figured you would want to hear.", "NTA.  A holiday meal is a lot of work.   He agreed to do his half.  There are many meetings every day.  But as long as he handles the turkey, the turkey gravy, the stuffing in the turkey, and whatever else was supposed to be on him, let him be.  Do not do any of his things.  Do not reschedule with his dad.  Do not stress about it.  Do your vegetarian options while listening to Xmas carolls and absolutely let go of your expectations of him.  Free yourself!", "Let him go, but tell him that his portion of dinner prep is paused until he returns.  It won\u2019t kill anyone to eat an hour later.", "NTA, only because he has other options for meetings at another time.  He made a promise and he should keep it.", "NTA since there are other meetings he could go to. It sounds like he\u2019s insisting on only the one during your preplanned meal prep time so he can get out of helping.", "NTA he's just trying to get out of helping", "NAH.  He can go to the meeting, but there will be no turkey.  Easy solution.", "NTA. But why not do dinner at a different time like 5-6 pm?", "NTA he's attempting to use his recovery to manipulate you.", "NTA. They have AA meetings pretty much hourly. He\u2019s using this as an excuse to offload all the work.", "Cook the turkey in a bag. No basting and comes out juicy.", "NAH.  My brother is a recovering alcoholic.  I don't think your husband wanted to go to the meeting to upset you.  I also don't think he was lying when he said everything was fine.  I suspect he was afraid that holiday stress might get to him if he didn't have support ahead of time.  It's entirely possible he didn't realize he felt this way when you agreed to your deal as far as meal prep goes.  If he did start to get scared that he might crack without support, it's natural that he would want to attend a meeting with the group he's most comfortable with.  I think both of you should apologize to each other just for the hurt feelings.  Moving forward, try making some of the sides ahead of time and just reheating them.  Honestly, mashed potatoes are perfectly fine when reheated.  Maybe try doing a ham instead of a turkey.  What I'm saying is, come up with a workable plan and be prepared to compromise.  Hugs of support to you all.", "NAH. He planned badly, but holidays can be hard for people in recovery. It doesn't seem like a good idea to stop him from going. Maybe dinner can be pushed back an hour? I'm sure his dad will understand.", "NAH. It sounds like you are in a difficult situation, trying to balance your husband's recovery with your own needs and feelings. It's important to remember that recovery from addiction is a process that requires ongoing support and commitment. At the same time, it's also important to consider your own needs and feelings and to communicate openly and honestly with your husband. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your concerns and try to find a resolution that works for both of you.", "If he needs a meeting, he needs a meeting. Use the internet to tell you how to baste the turkey.", "It\u2019s ridiculously obvious that the kindly response would have been \u201cIf you feel like you need a meeting, go. We can put dinner on hold for an hour.\u201d YTA", "OP, YTA. It\u2019s his first Christmas without his mom? He probably does need a meeting. The holidays are depressing for most people anyway - add in the stress from the past couple of years (the dumpster fire of 2020, Covid, etc) and his mom, and he\u2019s more than likely struggling. Just be patient and take care of what you can, and he will help out as soon as he is able.", "YTA\n\nYou want his recovery to take a backseat to turkey? Are you fucking kidding me? \n\nIt takes 20 seconds to baste a turkey and it\u2019s not rocket science. I bet you can pour yourself a drink, so there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t baste the damn turkey. \n\nYou sound incredibly entitled and definitely **not** supportive.", "YTA. Doesn't matter why he wants that meeting time. Forget about his promises to help cook, he told you his needs had changed from what they were when you made that agreement. It would be no different than waking up in the morning and saying i have a headache and need to lay down. He doesn't owe you any explanation about his struggles on a holiday or if there is support he needs or wants to offer someone else at that meeting. Please consider going to al anon meetings yourself, it will help you understand both addiction and codependency better.", "YTA\n\nYou do not need to deal with the turkey.\nThe dad can take over the turkey\nHusband can multitask and baste the turkey during the meeting.\nNot a big deal.", "YTA - get off Reddit and google how to cook a turkey", "YT (mild) A.

For him that means attending a meeting everyvday. Alcoholism does not take a holiday and a LOT of alcoholics/addicts pick up during the holidays.

Either start cooking the turkey earlier or push dinner off.", "I'm also in recovery and I would never tell someone that *their* actions are a detriment to *my* recovery. That's unfair and not taking responsibility, just as you said. Also, zoom meetings are cool because you can take them anywhere. Dude could totally put some headphones on, zoom in on his phone, and pop into the kitchen every once in a while to baste the turkey or whatever. \n\nYes, we are taught that our recovery comes first, but we are also taught that life happens.
