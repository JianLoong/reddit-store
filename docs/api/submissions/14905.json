Did you see the invitation?  Generally the invite should say all who are invited on it.", "Why didn't you just ask him? I can see why you would be hurt not being invited.

This year his cousin was getting married and months prior we had been planning to attend together. A few weeks ago he started talking about getting a suit but didn\u2019t seem to be acknowledging that I would be going also, thought that was odd but decided that maybe he was hasty in saying I was invited as obviously it wasn\u2019t his wedding. Flash forward to today and I see his sister has taken her partner despite his family knowing me more\u2026I feel really hurt because he didn\u2019t acknowledge the change of plans and after I brought it up he didn\u2019t see how I was hurt by him not telling me\u2026ultimately I know he has no say in the wedding but he does have a say in not hurting my feelings\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That it was on him to manage the plus one since his sister took someone. He should be overly apologetic.

If you didn\u2019t feel confident enough to ask, what does that say about the relationship?  I think this is the real issue.

He could have considered passing entirely on attending. NTA.", "INFO: Did you actually receive a wedding invite, or just your bf telling you about the wedding? Like, did the invitation say \"BF and OP.\" It sounds like no actual conversation was had, which lends me to ESH, pending more info.", "You might be younger and his sister and her partner be closer to the age of the sister and closer to getting married themselves than you guys.

Were you actually invited or did he tell you? YTA if you didn't clearly just ask him, so am I going with you or am I not invited.::", "INFO- Did you see the invitation and did it definitely say just your BF? I.e. are you sure it wasn't his choice? Alternatively has the invite with just his name on been pinned to the kitchen corkboard since it arrived and he thought you having seen the invitation was you knowing? Is his sister married or engaged to her partner (if people are trying to keep it small a 'no ring rule' isn't that rare)? There's something missing here. Either he's assumed you knew a detail that you didn't, or he wanted to go without you for some reason (which could be totally innocent like 'agreed to mind often over drunk uncle for the night and dude gets handsy when he's drunk and he didn't want you to have your night ruined').", "Why are you saying she is the AH when her boyfriend didn\u2019t communicate anything?

Being a good partner would be sharing that with her openly.  OP said she brought it up and bf didn\u2019t get it. Yes, she could ask a question and make things easier for herself at this point but that doesn\u2019t change that her bf didn\u2019t initially communicate anything with her.
