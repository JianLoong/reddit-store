{"id": 10685, "submission_id": "119jgiy", "title": "AITA for throwing away toys that my neighbor throws to my dog?", "selftext": "My husband and I (35M&F) have a 6 month old puppy. I take her for walks daily, but I also have a doggy door leading to a fenced-in backyard where she can run around in and do her business while I'm working. \n\nMy neighbor, \"Joan\" (50s-60sF) also has a dog. We've lived next door to one another for 10 years and don't really have much of a relationship. We wave, we're cordial, etc. When we adopted our puppy, she took great interest and I thought it was sweet. We'd occasionally chat over the fence about our dogs.\n\nWe ran into an issue when I was trying to train my dog to use the bathroom outside. Joan would call her name and distract her. We had several talks about it and it only sunk in when I was pretty firm.\n\nThen, I noticed that my puppy was bringing in toys that I didn't recognize. I assumed they were Joan's, so I kept throwing them back over to her side. And yet, they'd reappear. These toys are pretty dirty, some have gathered mold from being outside all the time. They're also too big for her to play with.\n\nI finally brought the toys back to Joan's house personally and asked if they were hers. She said yes, that she would throw them to my dog to play fetch. I asked her to not do that anymore as 1) the toys are too big for her, 2) I don't want her trying to jump over the fence and, 3) some of the toys are growing mold. I told her she should throw those away. She tried to make it like this cute thing she was doing, playing with my dog, and I said thank you, but no. She agreed to stop and to throw out the moldy toys. \n\nA week later, it happened again. Two of the balls and a rubber bone that I had personally walked back over ended up in my yard. I grabbed them and threw them in the trash. It took until today when I was outside for Joan to ask where the toys were. I told her that I had thrown them out. She got upset and said those weren't mine to dispose of. I said they were on my property. I asked if they made it over in our yard by accident or if she had thrown them on purpose. She admitted it was on purpose. I said \"Okay then\" and went back to playing with my dog. \n\nI went out later and while I was gone, she came over and complained to my husband, asking to be reimbursed for the toys. Keep in mind, these toys were very well-loved and clearly several years old. To keep the peace, my husband paid her $15. He said we just need to keep walking them over. I said no, she needs to stop throwing them. I said I would toss any more toys that ended up in our yard and we're not giving her more money. He says I'm going to \"disrupt the peace\" we have with our neighbors.

Shame on her for going to your spouse. Next time your spouse should refer her back to you.", "You're NTA. You have a husband problem as well as neighbor problem. He should be backing you up, not placating a boundary crossing neighbor in the name of peace.", "NTA. I can't see how would it be acceptable to throw things at anyone's house no matter the intentions.", "NTA - there is also a safety issue.  Puppies are like toddlers and things go in their mouths.    \n\n\nThrow the toys away, I would however get your spouse on the same page.  It is not ok for her to do what she is doing after you have asked her to stop, multiple times.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband has now undermined your point, so it's going to be hard to break this cycle.", "NTA but your hubby is for enabling her. You gave her multiple warnings about boundaries and she constantly breaks your trust. Throw those gross things out. Tell her if more moldy toys show up, you will throw them away because they are unsafe and on your property and you will not reimburse her again.", "God forbid your dog gets sick somehow from these toys. Just warn her of that possibility because if you took her to court and made note of your talks with her as well as you returning them you\u2019d win that case. NTA you had discussed appropriately what you\u2019d like her to stop doing. She did it anyways. You took control of the situation after that. She doesn\u2019t deserve those toys back.", "NTA you have asked nicely and she doesn't stop. Toss the toys. She's the one creating the issue and potential health risk for your dog.", "NTA.", "NTA you asked nicely and explained she didn\u2019t listen.

Damn.", "NTA.\n\nI had a neighbor like this too who would leave crusty old toys on our doorstep for our dog and get upset if we didn't give them to her. It's annoying when stuff like this happens cuz neighbors like that play the \"I'm just being nice\" card to make you seem like the jerk. You are not at all the AH for setting a boundary and your *neighbor* is the one disrupting the peace, not you. You've been nicer to her than you needed to be!", "NTA 100%. I work at a vet clinic and a patient of ours had to come in for his third obstruction surgery because a neighbor threw him a toy when his owners do not give him ANY TOYS AT ALL because he just. fucking eats them. Could have killed their dog. The context of your post even without my little story also makes what she is doing silly at best and dangerous at worst. Like come on, moldy toys? That\u2019s disgusting. Not to mention it could be spreading germs from her dog!", "NTA the neighbor is. You asked nnicely. You WALKED the toys back to her house. Told her again. Either she is deaf or does not give a damn what YOU want for YOUR dog. DH is wrong to pay her SHE threw the toys away, into your yard. Anything in your yard is yours to do with as you want. Heck I'd put a small covered trash can and put the toys in it. When asked where the toys are. \"What toys? She isn't a nice neighbor at all. Build a taller fence or plant plants that grow tall.", "I would have throw them away myself without thinking twice about it. You\u2019ve asked her to stop. She now knows you\u2019ll throw them away. Maybe next time you can show your husband how gross they are! NTA", "Oh my god NTA. This Joan sounds like she\u2019s psychotic.. or slow. You\u2019ve already asked her to stop and she\u2019s agreed. I\u2019d probably stand on principle and toss the toys in the trash since it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much of a relationship with this Joan anyway.", "NTA at all.  She's been asked to stop, she's been TOLD to stop, and she's throwing things into your yard that could actually harm your puppy.  Your husband is TA for giving her the money or thinking you actually have a peaceful relationship with her.  You don't.  You have a power struggle, and it needs to end.", "NTA. Might want to tell your neighbor that the next time garbage makes its way over your fence, that you'll be calling the cops for littering on your property.", "NTA. If Joan wants a dog, she should get her own dog.", "NTA. It does suck to have a bad relationship with your neighbors, but you've done everything in your power to set boundaries in a respectful way. \n\nShe now knows that any toy tossed over the fence will \"land\" in the trashcan.", "NTA - Personally if they weren\u2019t moldy (even too big isn\u2019t that much of an issue if she can grow into them) but Id keep them. Key word though WERENT MOLDY. She can cause your puppy to get sick by giving her toys like that, and she\u2019s also completely ignoring you talking to her several times and continuing to throw nasty moldy toys onto your property.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
