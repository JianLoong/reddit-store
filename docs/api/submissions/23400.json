I\u2019ve also struggled with nicotine addiction and I\u2019m not projecting, but with my story, I wanted to quit and had a lot of shame about it and hid it and lied about it etc. which is actually very normal when it comes to addiction, even addiction that seems more benign like nicotine. If you do want to quit, you need to learn to be really open and honest about your struggling with quitting. If you don\u2019t, then be honest about that too. But if you\u2019re wanting to quit, it would be a good idea to be honest with your partner about how you might try to lie/hide it and that you\u2019ll need his non judgment support. Just do your best, be open, and if you are trying to quit, find kind, non judgmental supportive people to help you through. If you don\u2019t want to quit, just be completely open and honest about that too.", "YTA - Lying. You are lying and yes it is a big deal. Not the smoking but the lying.

I personally am a non smoker who has dated mostly smokers. Over never asked any of them to quit or spoken on it at all.

Lying isn\u2019t great, but we are all human and sometimes slip up. \n\nI used to be a smoker and quit, but since I have had times when I\u2019ve slipped up and started for a period and I have always tried to hide it before I eventually owned up to it. \n\nWe all hide something and yes from me a soft YTA due to the lying (we all know it\u2019s wrong) but come on we all lie sometimes. \n\nOP, so please quit but do it for you and make it clear to your partner that there isn\u2019t a promise to him that you quit it is to yourself.", "I agree with you. I have smoked for about 8 years and had a hard time stopping completely. I than moved on to vaping which really helped me to not smoke anymore. I also noticed that it was a lot less bad for me in terms of stamina. \n\nAfter 2 years of vaping I was also kinda done with that and I was able to stop vaping pretty easily. \n\nStopping cold turkey is extremely hard and vaping can be a step in the right direction. That being said don't lie to your partner and always be honest to him.", "This. Vaping isn\u2019t smoking.

It\u2019s the dishonesty.", "Did you miss the part where they started up again, which is not the issue, they could have been open with that instead of hiding it.

Loved opening the pack, lighting the cig, the taste, all that jazz. Still miss it once and a while after a meal or watching a movie but ces't la vie!!\n\nReality check folks. Vaping isn't smoking.", "All the YTA replies you can read here are exactly the reason people don't feel safe to admit to relapse and go on hiding it and without getting help. In addiction, dishonesty is a direct result of an unsafe and/or unsupportive environment and shaming. For some reason people who don't smoke think it's easy to quit smoking and failure to do so is a moral flaw. No offense, but if you haven't gone through nicotine withdrawal, you have no idea what it does to your brain. A \"broken promise\" is meaningless in that state. It does create a lovely vicious circle of shame-craving-smoking though.\n\nI would also like to hear from OP about the \"promise\" cos the timing suggests that it was coaxed out of them through nagging when they weren't quite ready to commit to quitting.", "I already responded to a similar response, but the short answer is nicotine withdrawal and a promise to quit creates a vicious circle of craving-smoking-shame. This cycle can happen even if you just promise yourself that. If you are not in a completely supportive environment (or have one heck of mental fortitude) when that happens, you're pretty much screwed.\n\nThe fact they hid the relapse, to me at least, is simply a telltale sign of a lack of a safe environment.", "Yes we are saying the same but OP asked if they were the AH for lying about quitting. They didn't lie since they did quit. They withheld it when they started vaping which is technically something different than smoking and lied when confronted about the vape. I used to smoke and vape both and quitting nicotine is hard so I am trying to provide OP a little compassion when so many others are quick to dismiss the fact that they did initially quit.\n\nAddiction, even to nicotine, is hard and society seems to forget that. We are quick to destroy a person who cannot let go so hiding the truth becomes the norm for someone prone to the struggle. Maybe the partner has berated OP to the point that they weren't comfortable being honest when they had a set back...we don't know so I am going to give OP grace that they were trying their best and made a mistake by not coming forward.\n\nI also agree that withholding the truth is not good for relationships and they will have to work through that to see where they end up.", "I\u2019m deadly serious only thing op should have done is be more careful and not confess to the crime", "Thank you. It really is among the most destructive habits people can pick up.", "Strongly disagree. Lies aren\u2019t meaningless. They have actual consequences to the long term relationship even if recovery is successful. We all have to own our choices and the consequences of them. Addiction is incredibly difficult and needs a lot of support but that doesn\u2019t give all the dishonesty that typically accompanies it a pass.

I say this as the child of two smokers who have had various addictions in their lives, neither of them have had the true desire to quit smoking, so they simply don\u2019t.

And I get that quitting smoking is hard. Genuinely. But actions still have consequences and our behavior is still on us.

It's much more than just a white lie, it was a blatant attempt to circumvent something you promised to do. \n\nI also don't think you realize just how bad that shit is for you.

Without trust your relationship will crumble to pieces and if someone tells me that quit something but they're lying I'd leave. Yeah, you have the right to smoke if you want to.

Finally, remember this, when you put yourself in someone's shoes it allows you to understand why they do what they do. The only thing that matters is that you understand it in some way in your mind, it allows you to be at peace, and allows love to not become resentment and hatred. As well as it blossoms forgiveness. When you do put yourself in their shoes, understand that the details don't matter, if you were them, with their experiences, thoughts,  all of the above, you would of done the same things and came to the same exact conclusions they did everytime.

Vaping as opposed to smoking can be a helpful first step if you do your research about the types of vapes you\u2019re buying. Some still contain a LOT of nicotine, and you just end up trading one bad habit for another. Also, look into nicotine replacement products and find one that works for you. Call the QUIT line and ask for support. They may even be able to send samples of nicotine patches or lozenges to you for free.\n\nJust don\u2019t lie about it. Trust is paramount in a lasting relationship. Apologize to your partner and be honest about the fact that you\u2019re not ready/struggling to stop smoking.

Before anyone jumps in with how bad smoking is, this is minor in the scope of issues that will arise over the course of a marriage.", "Id say yes YTA. My bf quit vaping very early on in our relationship because he knew that it was important to me. If I found out he lied and was still vaping I\u2019d be extremely upset and question the entire relationship. \n\nYou were lying to your partner, someone you\u2019re supposed to have no secrets between. This is a major breach of trust.", "YTA for lying.\n\nQuit smoking is not easy, many people need psychological and medical help to make it. If you're one of those people it would be ok.\nBut lying implied you don't trust your partner enough to tell your needs, also don't trust their love is enough to listen, understand and support you in your process. Also, it may mean you didn't actually want to quit it, and are doing it just to avoid a conflict with them, and that would be really uncomfortable. That's why lying, even in little things, is not so little when you do it to your partner.\nI hope everything would be fine between you two.", "Yes", "Addictions suck. Most for the people under their influence but also for their loved ones. They hurt and costs a lot of courage but better ask for support rather than go behind their back. So torn: NTA because addictions make us do weird things. YTA when you take the easy way rather than the courageous one though.", ">I know it's bad\n\nYou answered your own question. YTA and you don't seem to really have much regard for your partner if you're willing to lie and continue to do something that threatens to shorten your time with him", "Quitting an addiction is hard. The fact that you couldn\u2019t just stop on your own isn\u2019t the problem. Lying to his face though\u2026 he\u2019s right not to trust you. You\u2019ve proven yourself to be a liar.", "YTA wtf", "YTA. And a massive one.\n\nDecades ago, my then boyfriend was a smoker. I hated it. He said he would stop. He never did. He actually lied about stopping. That was one of the reasons I broke up with him. \n\nLying to your partner is never a good idea, unless it is a little white lie for a birthday or something... But lying about quitting smoking is not a little white lie.", "Omg I did this too for awhile and it actually got me to quit! Lol \ud83d\ude02 I", "YTA. For lying AND the smoking. It\u2019s a disgusting and destructive habit.", "quitting is hard, and lying is a natural part of addiction. if you can\u2019t resist the urge to smoke at least tell yourself you have the strength to resist the urge to lie. being honest when you slip up will make you feel better, you\u2019ll get the feeling of shame over with sooner instead of pushing it off in exchange for the stress of being found out. + it\u2019ll help your partner trust you better and be able to support you better. yta but i wish you lots of luck in trying to quit!", "YTA for lying.\n\nMy ex did the same to me, and that is what got me thinking if he will lie about something so inconsequential then what else would he lie about?", "YTA", "I would say vaping is less harmful than smoking. My father died of lung cancer 4 years ago from smoking. His last audible words to me were \"I can't breathe\" after seeing a loves one die from smoking it kind of changes your mind. I do vape, it is a safer and less disgusting than smoking. But it is not harmless.", "It's hard to quit. So. Damn. Hard. \nI said I quit to husband, went back to smoking, came clean, tried again months later. It's been since May 27, 2001. Forgive yourself, try again when you're ready. Ask person to understand and either accept your secret or not, move on from there.", "YTA for lying to your partner. If you had been honest and told them the truth you wouldn't be, but instead you hid it from them.", "YTA. A small lie when it comes to addiction can turn in to big things very quickly. And broken trust is hard to repair. If you weren\u2019t caught, you would\u2019ve just lied to him forever right? Pretty messed up if you think about it", "YTA in this one. Smoking is a deal breaker for many people when it comes to relationships. He was willing to make a temporary exception for you (probably because he liked you enough to tolerate the smoking) and you promised him you\u2019d quit. Then you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a break of trust and it shows lack of respect for him boundaries (aka he doesn\u2019t like to date smokers). And then on top of it all you lied about it when you got caught? This just breaks trust even more because you were able to lie so easily to his face (what else have you lied about or could you lie about in the future?) and completely dismissed his boundary. And now you say he\u2019s overreacting, which is again disrespectful against his feelings and thoughts on the matter. Clearly the asshole for lying.\n\nIf you agreed to quit without him forcing you to, then he\u2019s not an asshole and you\u2019re still an asshole for lying.\n\nIf he forced you to quit even though you didn\u2019t want to, then he\u2019s also an asshole because he can\u2019t force you to quit like that. You guys are just not compatible and shouldn\u2019t be dating. Still doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not an asshole for lying and breaking his trust though.", "YTA. Personally, smoking or vaping is a dealbreaker for me. It might be a bigger deal than you think it is. And regardless of what the lie was about, you still lied *twice* which is a big deal in and of itself.", "Yep. You are.  Your partner has reason not to trust you now because you have a history of lying.  I understand that quitting smoking/tobacco is very difficult. Vaping is actually more harmful to your health than smoking.  And lying \ud83e\udd25 about smoking on top of breaking your promise is worse than only breaking your promise.", "I\u2019m sorry, YTA", "Yeah YTA. Don't lie to people you give a shit about.\n\nAlso, YTA. Quit smoking. That shit's absolutely disgusting and expensive, with the added bonus of forcing your loved ones to watch you die a painful death.", "You\u2019re always TA when you lie to your partner", "Only to yourself, sweetie. I quit 10 years ago now. And I'm stuck to my vape. But I can breathe. I don't have a cough, and I am able to move without being breathless. You're only lying to yourself. I suggest getting a vape. My mum and mother in law, both who started in their teens, were able to quickly make the change. Just try it for 1 week. Don't just have one puff and go, oh, I don't like this. Give it one week. Trust me. You'll be so much happier. If you smoke non menthol, you can get tobacco eliquids. Fr. Give it a go.\nYou're only lying to yourself. Xxxxx", "YTA, Lying will break the trust between partners like glass shatters on the ground. Smoking will make your life hell in your later years. you chose to lie and smoke both of which are bad for your Marriage. but your biggest problem is that you think that these are not serious and that your husband is overreacting.", "Yes! I think lying is way worse than the honest truth. I tell my kids lying to me is 10x worst than the bad truth.", "Yeah and then tried to lie again saying the vape wasn't hers. Geez Louise, does Reddit really need to tell people they are an asshole if they lie? I'm shocked that this is really the situation.", "My grandma smoked her whole life and continued to do so after she was diagnosed with COPD. She passed away last August after a very long and miserable battle. I truly just don\u2019t understand why people want to smoke knowing the consequences.", ">smoking is one of the hardest things to quit because you have to find something else to relieve stress, and that's hard.\n\nNicotine withdrawl is the thing causing the intense stress in the first place. It's really unhelpful to tell yourself that you are addicted because of the stress. Stress might have led to the first cigarette but addiction keeps you going. Not trying to be a smart ass here but when you have managed to quit and to create new circuits in your brain, that kind of stress literally vanishes and won't need any replacement. This is hopefully a ray of light for people who keep relapsing and think that it will be like that forever.\n\nFor reference: I've managed to quit two addictions and have learned quite a bit on how addiction works in the body and brain so I'm fairly confident to state this. Not some new age bs."]}
