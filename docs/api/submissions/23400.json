I\u2019ve also struggled with nicotine addiction and I\u2019m not projecting, but with my story, I wanted to quit and had a lot of shame about it and hid it and lied about it etc. which is actually very normal when it comes to addiction, even addiction that seems more benign like nicotine. If you do want to quit, you need to learn to be really open and honest about your struggling with quitting. If you don\u2019t, then be honest about that too. But if you\u2019re wanting to quit, it would be a good idea to be honest with your partner about how you might try to lie/hide it and that you\u2019ll need his non judgment support. Just do your best, be open, and if you are trying to quit, find kind, non judgmental supportive people to help you through. If you don\u2019t want to quit, just be completely open and honest about that too.", "YTA - Lying. You are lying and yes it is a big deal. Not the smoking but the lying. If you can't tell the truth to your partner then it makes the AH. You are trying to blame him for over reacting and somehow make him the bad guy here. No. You are the AH here.", "My husband just died in my living room from smoking cigarettes. Just throwing that out there.", "Grow up", "But but he is overreacting /s", "Agreed. To label someone an a-hole for not wanting to disappoint their partner because they\u2019ve been unable to overcome an addiction is a total overreaction.", "Where did she say he demanded she change for him?", "No where do they say their partner gave them shit about smoking. I personally am a non smoker who has dated mostly smokers. Over never asked any of them to quit or spoken on it at all. But if they told me they had quit them o found out they lied to me I\u2019d be very upset. Not that they didn\u2019t quit but that they lied to me. The issue isn\u2019t that they\u2019re still smoking. The issue is that they\u2019ve been lying for a while and then tried to lie again that the vape wasn\u2019t theirs.", "Absolutely agree. Lying isn\u2019t great, but we are all human and sometimes slip up. \n\nI used to be a smoker and quit, but since I have had times when I\u2019ve slipped up and started for a period and I have always tried to hide it before I eventually owned up to it. \n\nWe all hide something and yes from me a soft YTA due to the lying (we all know it\u2019s wrong) but come on we all lie sometimes. \n\nOP, so please quit but do it for you and make it clear to your partner that there isn\u2019t a promise to him that you quit it is to yourself.", "I agree with you. I have smoked for about 8 years and had a hard time stopping completely. I than moved on to vaping which really helped me to not smoke anymore. I also noticed that it was a lot less bad for me in terms of stamina. \n\nAfter 2 years of vaping I was also kinda done with that and I was able to stop vaping pretty easily. \n\nStopping cold turkey is extremely hard and vaping can be a step in the right direction. That being said don't lie to your partner and always be honest to him.", "This. Vaping isn\u2019t smoking. After 11 years of smoking I swapped to vaping and there has been a massively noticeable difference in my cardio since doing so 3 years ago. And for reference I compete in amateur enduro mountain bike races so my lungs get pushed quite hard. However, YTA for trying to lie about it, and trying to keep it secret in the first place.", "Addiction doesn\u2019t excuse lying. Dealing with an addiction is incredibly difficult. But it doesn\u2019t absolve us of accountability for our behavior. Addiction is subject to relapse but it\u2019s not the relapse that was the problem here. It\u2019s the dishonesty.", "Did you miss the part where they started up again, which is not the issue, they could have been open with that instead of hiding it. And once caught they lied to their boyfriends face? THAT is what\u2019s an AH behavior.", "Quitting is hard, and they should keep trying. However, lying to your partner is an ah move.", "It's not about the addiction but lying. \n\nOP, trust is a huge thing in a relationship and lying doesn't help. Since it's open now maybe try seeking medical help to try quit. At least this shows your partner that you're trying different ways to quit. \n\nAnd trust me, you can do it. I thought I couldn't but once I did, it's been the best decision of my life.", "\u201cTechnically did not lie\u201d has no place in relationships. Hiding the fact that they started smoking again is a lie even if they don\u2019t actually say the words. \n\nI get that overall you were making the same point. But I had to say something.", "Scam or just stupid. What works for you won't work on other ppl. You can't go around saying \"buying this will magically help you\"", "Put out my last one over ten years ago and haven\u2019t touched nor wanted to touch one since after reading that book!", "no way you said this seriously", "Let me tell you, if I had a sneaky cig after quitting, I would have gone right back to smoking. \n\nGotta quit for reals. Don\u2019t fall off the wagon.", "Sorry for your loss.", "Are you telling that to me or OP?", "Yeah, she shouldn't bother lying, she should own it.\n\nVaping is what got me to quit smoking by breaking the RITUAL which is what I was super addicted to. Loved opening the pack, lighting the cig, the taste, all that jazz. Still miss it once and a while after a meal or watching a movie but ces't la vie!!\n\nReality check folks. Vaping isn't smoking.", "All the YTA replies you can read here are exactly the reason people don't feel safe to admit to relapse and go on hiding it and without getting help. In addiction, dishonesty is a direct result of an unsafe and/or unsupportive environment and shaming. For some reason people who don't smoke think it's easy to quit smoking and failure to do so is a moral flaw. No offense, but if you haven't gone through nicotine withdrawal, you have no idea what it does to your brain. A \"broken promise\" is meaningless in that state. It does create a lovely vicious circle of shame-craving-smoking though.\n\nI would also like to hear from OP about the \"promise\" cos the timing suggests that it was coaxed out of them through nagging when they weren't quite ready to commit to quitting.", "I already responded to a similar response, but the short answer is nicotine withdrawal and a promise to quit creates a vicious circle of craving-smoking-shame. This cycle can happen even if you just promise yourself that. If you are not in a completely supportive environment (or have one heck of mental fortitude) when that happens, you're pretty much screwed.\n\nThe fact they hid the relapse, to me at least, is simply a telltale sign of a lack of a safe environment.", "Yes we are saying the same but OP asked if they were the AH for lying about quitting. They didn't lie since they did quit. They withheld it when they started vaping which is technically something different than smoking and lied when confronted about the vape. I used to smoke and vape both and quitting nicotine is hard so I am trying to provide OP a little compassion when so many others are quick to dismiss the fact that they did initially quit.\n\nAddiction, even to nicotine, is hard and society seems to forget that. We are quick to destroy a person who cannot let go so hiding the truth becomes the norm for someone prone to the struggle. Maybe the partner has berated OP to the point that they weren't comfortable being honest when they had a set back...we don't know so I am going to give OP grace that they were trying their best and made a mistake by not coming forward.\n\nI also agree that withholding the truth is not good for relationships and they will have to work through that to see where they end up.", "I\u2019m deadly serious only thing op should have done is be more careful and not confess to the crime", "Thank you. It really is among the most destructive habits people can pick up.", "Strongly disagree. Lies aren\u2019t meaningless. They have actual consequences to the long term relationship even if recovery is successful. We all have to own our choices and the consequences of them. Addiction is incredibly difficult and needs a lot of support but that doesn\u2019t give all the dishonesty that typically accompanies it a pass. Lying to someone affects whether or not they trust you even if the lies were in service of an addiction. \n\nAlso, former smoker. Relapsed multiple times.", "This is a great way to make excuses for someone willfully lying to their partners face. I have an immense amount of empathy for addicts, but you\u2019re truly just enabling them by acting like her hiding her relapse and then straight up lying to him is acceptable simply because she\u2019s dealing with addiction. And also somehow his fault because \u201cshe\u2019s not in a safe environment\u201d?\n\nAddicts do not stop until they are ready to quit and put in the work. It won\u2019t matter how safe of an environment they\u2019re in if they\u2019re not willing to deal with how difficult the recovery process is. I say this as the child of two smokers who have had various addictions in their lives, neither of them have had the true desire to quit smoking, so they simply don\u2019t. The difference is they haven\u2019t made promises they know they\u2019ll be unable to keep.", "I hear what you\u2019re saying but just don\u2019t agree that they didn\u2019t lie. Lies by omission are still lies. Hiding that they started vaping is dishonest and that\u2019s what their partner is saying. It\u2019s not the relapse that makes them the AH. It\u2019s covering it up. And I get that quitting smoking is hard. Genuinely. But actions still have consequences and our behavior is still on us. Even if we can understand the motivation that led someone to lie, they still broke their partner\u2019s trust, they\u2019re the AH in that situation, and shouldn\u2019t deal with the fallout by trying to minimize.", "Yes it is."]}
