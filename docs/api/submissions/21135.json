Using it for a move is much different than new driver training.

Sounds like the bf already promised the car to his friend without double checking with you. His mistake, he needs to address it with the friend.", "NTA why would you lend the car to potentially get damaged? And even if it is \"both\" of your car, it takes two to agree to lend it out.

It sounds like he already promised his friend and is telling you instead of discussing it with you first.\nYou are for pulling the \"It's mine\" without having the proper communication beforehand setting boundaries in place. Like lending the car to others takes two yessus and one no. Live and learn.", "For not wanting inexperienced driver driving a car NTA.\n\nYTA for telling your bf it's your car just because it has your name on it while you're splitting the costs and he drives it more than you do. I dont know about the legal stance where you live, but where i'm from that car would be joint ownership considering your situation. A lot of families have just 1 car and it's in one persons name. That doesnt mean its just their car if it's a family car.\n\nEdit: spelling", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
