Was it made clear to your boyfriend that you now owned the car rather than the two of you having a shared car? Did you discuss the pros and cons of that for each of you? Previously, when you had a shared car, did you check with him before loaning it to a friend, was it a mutual discussion and ask, did he say yes, or did you just give the friend permission and tell your boyfriend later?\n\nEven if it was a shared car, neither of you should be loaning it out without the others' permission. But the way this is written, it sounds like that has happened at least once in the past. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong not to loan this other friend a car for a driver\u2019s test and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong to maintain sole ownership of this car, but I do think it was poorly done to go from a shared car to a single car and not explicitly discuss all the implications of that including that he\u2019d have less freedom to exercise how the car was used than he previously had. \n\nYour boyfriend bought a car with you and presumably had equal decision making over that car. You then sold that car and split the profits. Now your boyfriend is paying to use your car. That\u2019s a very different relationship dynamic. Your boyfriend is basically routinely borrowing a car from you at the cost of half whatever it is to maintain, pay for parking, insurance, etc. but he cannot say what happens to the car. It\u2019s very clear that if you split up tomorrow you\u2019d get the car. If your boyfriend totals the car tomorrow, I\u2019m also not clear on how that would be handled? If you sell it, it sounds like you\u2019d get the profits regardless of how much work he\u2019s put into it. In other words, it\u2019s a lot less equal than it was when the two of you were actually sharing a belonging rather than him regularly borrowing and getting use out of your belonging and him charging you for it.\n\nWas he given the choice here? Or was this more of a \"now I have a nicer car so we should just sell our old one, don't worry you can still use mine as long as you split the costs with me\" situation?\n\nYou basically went from a shared possession to both of you using your possession and it\u2019s not clear you ever discussed that. This leaves both of you a bit vulnerable to things going wrong. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole here, but I do think this could have all been avoided if you\u2019d actually put a little forethought and healthy communication into this process sooner.\n\nDeciding to sell a shared car and replace it with your car does imply that your car will be available to use in the same way the shared car was, so I\u2019m not surprised he mistakenly made that assumption. \n\nI think you need to do some work to repair your relationship. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to let this friend use the car, you shouldn\u2019t. But it does mean apologizing to your boyfriend about not being clearer about whose car it was and maybe even coming up with a more equitable way of paying for the car that you own and he regularly gets to borrow (example: he pays gas and parking since he uses it the most, you pay for any minor and major repairs).\n\nWhen you as a couple go from say, sharing an apartment to living in a home one person owns, sharing a car to both of you using a shared car, or other similar relationship shifts usually that\u2019s discussed before it\u2019s agreed to and both parties understand the implications. From your boyfriend\u2019s reaction it sounds like he previously thought this was a shared car. If you initially presented it in a way that led him to think that then you did move into asshole territory.", "you're NTA because your bf wants to use the car in a silly way.\n\nBut it's interesting how you're willing to play the \"it's mine\" card even though you split the expenses for the car and use at least equally.\n\nhow you say things can be very impactful, more so than what you say sometimes.", "NTA at all but you keep say \u201cwe have/had car.

Otherwise, you could\u2019ve sold your share it to him. So it\u2019s not fair to play those games. It\u2019s an asshole move just because technically your name is on the title since  you have establish pattern are ready of sharing it equally. However, I\u2019m guessing you made this power move because he wasn\u2019t going to agree with you and honor your input.   So you had to pull out the big guns to stop it - if so that\u2019s on him for not honoring your rights or your wishes. \n\nShared property however affects both of you, and he was wrong to do some thing that affects and impacts you without your say in it. You\u2019re in it together, but in short he should ask you before making any promises on his own. In short, you can praise him for his generous spirit with his friend point out that going forward anything that affects you needs to be discussed with you with your sign off. It\u2019s good to work this understanding and these types of things out if you\u2019re going to stay with him long-term. \n\nBoth of you need to apologize but he needs to understand you only made such a power statement because he was already disrespecting you.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know how insurance works where you are, but he\u2019s not insured to drive your car.

That doesn\u2019t give him \u201cequal rights\u201d to the car - you\u2019re being generous by letting him use it and he\u2019s getting used to being able to take advantage of something you brought. For example if you use a U-haul, Hertz rental, zipcar, Turo etc you pay by the hour (on top of membership fees)\u2026but you have NO claim on the car. Ofc in relationships you tend to share but it\u2019s not ok to feel so entitled.\n\nSecond, even if it were co-owned he should have asked the other co-owner if they\u2019re ok with it.
