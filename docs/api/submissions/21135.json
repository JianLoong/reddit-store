I dont know about the legal stance where you live, but where i'm from that car would be joint ownership considering your situation. A lot of families have just 1 car and it's in one persons name.

The old car was clearly, jointly, both of theirs.  They split the money when they sold it.  \n\nThis car is replacing that joint car.  They BOTH pay equally into costs and maintenance for it.\n\nIf they split up, it would be clear that the car is hers and she should get to keep it.  But this isn't about who gets to physically possess it in the case where only one of them can.  This is about it being used by one party, when the other party has no need for it.\n\nSince they BOTH pay for it's ongoing maintenance, the car was receiving with the intention of it being used by both of them, they made a joint choice to sell the other car with the idea that this car would be available to use instead...\n\nI think OP can't claim the use of the car as just hers.  She needs to have an actual conversation with her boyfriend about her concerns and not just yell \"mine!\" Because all she's doing is undermining their relationship.  \n\nThey sold the old car with the understanding that he would have joint use of this one.  If OP was going to say it was just hers and he doesn't get to make co-equal decisions about it's use, he might have chosen to keep their old car, and not paid into the upkeep of this one.", "Her parents gifted that car to her and they both agreed to sell the old for money which she also bought herself. He should have used his proceeds to invest in his own car and he is not entitled to that car if she decides she doesn't want him using it.

I honestly think even without the paperwork, if it was jointly owned, this is one of those situation that takes two yes-es and gets shot down/stopped with one no. BUT it sort of depends how much the BF argues against the no if you bring up the ownership. I do think it sounds like OP jumped there a little quickly though.", "> you two have a ~~long~~ very short only 2 year history of collaboration with regards to an old cheap car ~~s~~ that you bought together, not your beloved deceased grandfathers car that you inherited\n\nTf?  Since when is 2 years \u201ca LoNg hiStorY\u201d lmao.  Not carS - ONE car, an old wreck that they both paid money for and bought together.  What, if she had inherited her grandmothers jewellery and a friend wanted to wear nice jewellery, her bf can just offer it to another friend because they\u2019d in the past bought some together?

Not cool.**", "The fact that the bf got his money out of the sale of the previous car makes that point totally irrelevant. The boyfriend has \"joint use\" of it now, which is why he's responsible for half the upkeep and maintenance on it.

I also said that he was an AH for telling his friend he could use it without consulting OP. \n\nWhere I think OP handled it wrong was in how she came across. Up until that point, they had always shared the car. She even says that while the car is legally hers, it was \u2018meant\u2019 for both of them. They share the expenses equally, and they had let a friend borrow their car in the past. So, while she was legally in the right, she upended an expectation based on 3 years of experience by pulling the MINE card. It probably blindsided the boyfriend. \n\nHer reasons for doing so are sound, but her delivery was kind of shitty.", "> They sent me a legal document for the car that says it\u2019s mine and that my boyfriend doesn\u2019t own any part of it. **But it was meant for both of us.** We split the costs evenly and my boyfriend uses it way more than me.\n\nI'm kind of at ESH. I get why OP doesn't want to risk the car and the BF is an A for not discussing before he gave the friend permission. Even if his name were on the car, too, he would be an A. She's kind of an A for pulling the \"it's mine\" card after she freely admits the car was meant for both of them and he shares all expenses for it.\n\n(Sounds like the parents left it in her name only to protect it in case they broke up.)"]}
