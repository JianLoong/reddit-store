It was genuinely amicable on all sides at the time. My mom re-married a couple years later; my step-dad is great. My dad met his now-wife, B, a few years after the divorce. B convinced him that my mom was intentionally keeping financial information from him and trying to cheat him out of money (she wasn't, but he's 100% sold on it).\r  \n\r  \nMy sisters eventually stopped going to see our dad because they said B wouldn't stop bad-mouthing our mom, and generally made them super uncomfortable. I was in college at the time, and my dad never tried to reach out to me. That all happened six years ago.\r  \n\r  \nA couple months ago, my dad suddenly started texting me again and asked to see me. It happened the same day B threatened my mom with legal action if she wouldn't take my youngest sister (K, now 17) to see my dad, and about a week after he tried to reach out to my other sister (C, 21). C wound up cursing them out because she said B wouldn't stop talking about our mom.\r  \n\r  \nI agreed to see him because I didn't want him to focus on K (she's said many times that she wants nothing to do with him or B). It was alright at first, but B kept saying negative things about my mom and C and they both made uncomfortable comments about me being gay. I told them that I wasn't comfortable with any of that, and they were better afterwards. My dad is in very poor health, so I was willing to put up with more than I usually would be since I don't know how long we have to mend our relationship.\r  \n\r  \nThen he kept trying to get me to hang out with him, B, and their kids from B's previous marriage. I agreed, but I'm busy with grad school and family stuff, and he eventually accused me of not prioritizing \"spending time with my family.\"\r  \n\r  \nThis is where I think I might be the A-hole. It felt hypocritical coming from someone who just dropped me so easily, so I kinda went off on him. I said that I do prioritize my family, but that's my mom, step-dad, and sisters, not his family. When he asked me if I didn't want a relationship with his step-kids, I was honest and said that I'm open to it but it's not a priority for me. I know I really hurt his feelings, and I do feel bad about that. He accused me of \"replacing\" him with my step-dad, and I told him that I wouldn't have had to replace him if he'd bothered being in my life. He hasn't spoken to me since.\r  \n\r  \nI was harsher than I should have been, especially since I've been trying to be the adult in this whole situation, and I feel a responsibility to keep things civil so he doesn't try to force himself back into K's life when she's been clear she doesn't want that.

She's at the age where a court will listen to her about whether she wants her birth father in her life or not. Your father is very unlikely to get anywhere if he tries to bring this to court.\n\nAnd you already know they don't like your sister or your mom, or you being gay. Honestly, you've already been the bigger person. Right now, you're just trying to stop him from walking all over you. He's trying to play the victim, but he's not the victim. He kept insulting your mother, to you kids, and decided that if you get upset about it, it's your fault. That's really immature behavior, and he's your father. Even if you're both adults, you shouldn't have to keep being the bigger man. OP, you are very clearly not the AH, and I'd recommend you stop seeing him if he keeps acting this way. You shouldn't have to put up with his bs", "NTA- and I am so furious on your behalf.\n\nHe was trying to provoke you into saying something awful, so that when you blew up he could walk away feeling justified. \n\nWhat an awful, manipulative way to treat your child.", "NTA he made the relationships with you and your siblings what they became.

But that\u2019s the way it goes. \n\nDo not accept abuse or mistreatment on any topic, and definitely not on your sexuality, from people even if they\u2019re dying. You don\u2019t need that in your life and honestly: if he\u2019s older and ill and is still unable to just love you as you are, walk away at your sole discretion any time and for however long you want/ need/ like. \n\nI used to get accused of replacing a toxic bio mother with my stepmom but I don\u2019t anymore. Know why? Because I hang out and talk to my stepmom often. Haven\u2019t seen bio mom in more than a decade. You deserve good people in your life.

It's insane!", "Being the \"adult in this whole situation\" does not mean squashing down your feelings and letting toxic people run your life. He is the one who will have to live with the consequences of abandoning you and the least he can do is listen.

I give you a lot of credit for trying, but dad should know that B is making it all but impossible with her insults against your mom. At k's age, I don't think they can force anything on her. You were just being honest with him. I can't help but think B is still trying to get money somehow.", "NTA. Seems he is try to fix things before he dies. He didn't need you up to this point. Why worry about him now?", "NTA. Your dad is in poor health and he is suddenly looking for a replacement male adult for his step kids. He doesn\u2019t care about a relationship with you. You need to avoid him.", "NTA. Depending on where you live, your youngest sister may have the right to decide whether or not she visits your father. Your mother\u2019s attorney should be able to spell out what rights your sister has and if her refusal to visit leaves your mother open to legal action. As f your father and his new family? He has made it abundantly clear that you are not a priority for him. His wife and her children are not your family.", "NTA. He made his choices and they didn't include supporting his biological children, he went with his step kids. Good for him. \n\nThe outcome of that is that his bio kids have no interest in him, his new wife or her children, who are not related to you or your sisters.
