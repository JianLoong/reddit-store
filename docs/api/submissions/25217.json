You should have refused the lesser amount of food. It is the restaurant's responsibility to update their website. They advertised for a certain price and they should have honored it. I would call the manager/owner. If that doesn't get you satisfaction post bad reviews.", "NTA. Even if the food is already made, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for it if you do not take it. Of course you shouldn\u2019t order food and not pick it up, but the price change was a special circumstance. This is not how a business should operate if they want repeat customers.", "Why did you pay and accept the smaller than advertised portions?", "NTA.

Like others have written, I think she should have honored the pricing on the website.  It is not your website; it is their website.\n\nCheck again in a day or two if the same pricing is still up on the website.\n\nWhen I get irritated at a business, I write them a letter.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you have a price that was expected on their own websites. Doesn't matter what he said he either needs to take down the website or be very clear that the price changed.\n\nOtherwise...false advertising", "NTA. I wouldn't have taken what she gave me. I would have said I wasn't what's on the site or I'm not paying anything.", "Nta. That\u2019s false advertising.", "NTA I\u2019m seeing this new trend wiht restaurants that they have one price online and another in the store", "NTA and honestly you should\u2019ve stuck to not paying all together. She needed to change her website.", "NTA\n\nShe totally ripped you off...nothing to feel guilty about. \n\nShe should have honored the prices on the website, period.\n\nShe then gave you less food to effect the same outcome, with a bunch of grief, and wasting your time. While the food got cold.", "NTA. Until the offer is taken off the website, that price should still be honoured. I would have said, \"Sorry, I came her specifically because of the special  that is still on the menu\" and walked out. I would not have accepted a half serving. \n\nMaybe the food won't be as good with the new owner. \n\nIf you want to go back you will have to wear a fake rubber nose and moustache and heavy black glasses.", "I felt guilty because she did have broken english(not trying to be rude at all) and I felt as though I said something or she said something, slight confusion on both parts. When I showed her the website she said that\u2019s the old owners website and I said \u201cBut it\u2019s still the same phone number and name.\u201d", "Thank you very much. I felt guilty when she was getting upset with me as if I was doing something wrong. She kept repeating she is the new owner and I asked why is it on the website then.", "I asked her kindly if I may speak to the manager and she said she was the owner. I\u2019m not saying this in any rude way at all, but she did have broken English. I didn\u2019t want to be rude or upset her if there was confusion or if I said something that might of been confusing in the first place.", "I agree. And when I showed her the website and said I was the one who called about the meal plans she said \u201cNo. I\u2019m the new owner.\u201d When I ordered the food I specifically said I was taking the meal plans five meals and she asked if I wanted a salad or rice base.", "I froze and she said I had to pay for something since the food was being made", "That\u2019s what I said to her, I said I am very confused because it\u2019s the same name and has the same website. I literally said nvm I rather not pay for the food and leave and she was like no you have to pay and take the food.", "She said I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave without paying. I froze. I promise I\u2019m usually much more stern, Bhutto because of the possible broken English barrier(not trying to be rude at all), I felt like I was in the wrong", "My mom said the same thing when I told her what has happened. I just froze, idk. I wasn\u2019t prepared for that to happen since I called in advance.", "The meal prep menu and price is still up I keep checking. If it is still up by Friday I will write a review about the prices, not the food. Food is always great there.", "When I got home I saw it still wasn\u2019t taken down, I screen recorded it with the date.", "I will look into that thank you.", "Thank you. She finally did honor the pricing, but took the food out of each container and put it in a much smaller one. I just felt guilty because there was a broken English barrier and I don\u2019t like confrontation.", "They made it clear that the price changed when I went to pay for it, so I said I rather not take the food then and they said I had to pay. When I said I don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s when they put it in much smaller portions (looked like a side salad) and then honored the ten dollar mela prepping price", "It's an understandable mistake on her end if she just forgot or didn't know to take it down, but she should have honored the deal then take the posting down, or respect your decision to not buy anything. She acted ridiculous, NTA\n\nIt's also stupid business on her part. I'm willing to bet you'll understandably never go back there.", "No, that's a cop out. She's the new owner but if it's operating in the same place under the same name, then she should have made herself aware of what deals had been advertised.", "There is a difference between being rude and allowing yourself to be cheated. It is the restaurant's responsibility to maintain the prices on their website.  She should have honored the advertised price. Actually, in many places she would be legally obligated to honor the price. At a bare minimum - she should have allowed you to cancel the order. Taking your money but giving you a fraction of the food you thought you were getting is ridiculous. If anything - she is the one that is being rude.\n\nSomehow people have gotten the idea that sticking up for yourself makes you rude - that is not true. You should always be polite and respectful of course. But that doesn't mean you have to allow a restaurant to get away with false advertising. At best - the restaurant owner is acting in ignorance. At worst - she is intentionally cheating customers. In either case it is not your problem to fix.", "See that\u2019s where you\u2019re much nicer than me. I would have walked right out the door.", "You are being very fair.", "I'd write a review.  Well, that's a little soon. But if it's up after a day or so, I'd write a review.", "Yeah but they advertised the wrong price and didn't tell you over the phone.", "I was mostly more upset because I love their food. So I feel like I\u2019m scared to go back", "the new owner may not be able to take the old site down without cooperation from the old owners or third parties.", "I completely agree. She said that she couldn\u2019t give me the meal prep price because the meals were too big. She said that she would give me smaller portion like how the old owner did, but it took a bit of back and fourth to hey the accommodations. It just looks like a side salad and I wish I took the money to grocery shop instead.", "I was thinking I would write an review, only about the change of owner, the food seems to still be good so I don\u2019t want to say anything about that. I feel bad because it\u2019s a small business and I don\u2019t want someone to suffer when it comes to money. Even if it was still their mistake. I just feel bad.", "Yes. That\u2019s why I was very upset because I called ahead and asked about that specific menu items.", "I completely agree. She said that she couldn\u2019t give me the meal prep price because the meals were too big. She said that she would give me smaller portion like how the old owner did, but it took a bit of back and fourth to hey the accommodations. It just looks like a side salad and I wish I took the money to grocery shop instead.", "You're too nice. You basically let yourself get scammed out of niceness.\n\nShe said you had to pay, but what could she have done if you had walked away? Call the cops? What would the charges have been?", "Nta. They have it as a promo and you even called ahead to verify it. That's on them.", "NTA. It's false advertising", "NTA. You didn\u2019t confuse the advertising for another business (which happened to me as a sales associate). It was their website. When you buy a business, you get all that. If she didn\u2019t want to keep that promo, she should have changed it (or had someone do so)", "Next time, just say no and leave. Don\u2019t let people walk over you like that", "Sadly, since the business has changed, the food likely will change as well.\n\nSince they've already changed their business module.", "Absolutely don\u2019t go back. A decent business owner wouldn\u2019t try to scam you like that", "This is true... but they should honour the deal advertised on the website.  If nothing else, they'll probably keep a customer, instead of definitely losing one... and probably not just one."]}
