Here's how they describe themselves:\n\n\"XYZ is a tailored 9-month incubation program aimed at diversifying the tech entrepreneurship sector by welcoming entrepreneurs of all ages, backgrounds, genders and walks of life.\n\nAs part of the program, you'll gain access to a coworking space, early-stage financing opportunities, and a network of mentors, coaches, and investors. With over 80 workshops led by local and international experts, you'll learn essential business and soft skills to bring your ideas to life.\n\nDon't miss out on this chance to kickstart your startup journey!\"", "not a scam, Google + govt funded!", "hi, I reposted because I ommitted key details. We were supposed to stick around for feedback after the ceremony.\n\nI stormed off and sent emails to the organisers. I guess that's the conflict. I've been ruminating on it a lot and considered leaving comments on their publicity material, which is not a good idea. This seemed like a better way to get it off my chest.\n\nThere's even more wrong with their recruitment process IMO but I didn't want to ramble too much", "no. They're partnered with the government and Google and their objective is to help you with your startup. It looks like a great opportunity for those selected. It's just the recruitment practices that are shocking", "Anyone can say \"partnered with.\" Pyramid schemes like Amway are famous for saying they're \"partnered with\" this and that.

I am sure this is disappointing. As the others are saying, just imagine how terrible their treatment would be daily if this is how they handle hiring!

Good luck!", "Their offices are huge, in the main train station. As I went to the bathroom, I even passed a door which said \"swimming pool\".\n\nThey're also funded by the state, by the local government.

But I think that the vast majority stayed for feedback. This is mainly what made me wonder if I was the AH.\n\nAlso, they took a group photo of those accepted after announcing them, and the rejects had to awkwardly shuffle out of the way and help move chairs (it was a cramped space). None of this was explicitly uttered, it was just awkwardly understood. I even took an awkward photo of the scene in disbelief.\n\nAfter that, I left.", "I don't think it's that. They pay you to attend a business course and introduce you to investors. I don't even have residency officially, as I came here during the pandemic to be with my partner. So my situation is messier than ever as I start up my company. It would have really helped, even if they're the AH.\n\nMaybe there's a cultural element but it's in Western Europe and these people are proud of how in touch with American culture they are. They do the interviews and mastercalss in English. They're partnered with Google and partially funded by them. The main \"masterclass\" guy worked with Google for ages.\n\nMy guess was that it was some weird way to massage the masterclass guy's ego by forcibly boosting attendance.\n\nIn my email I suggested concept 6 for next year's masterclass: captive audience, lol", "Thank you! It honestly would have helped just to start the process even as I would have got my documents in order at least. I came to this country to be with my partner during the pandemic and everything's up in the air launching this startup.\n\nBeing accepted would have helped with this, even if it turned out the course content wasn't great. Also, they get you to pitch to investors, so objectively it would have helped stabilise my life even if they behaved as AHs with recruitment.\n\nYou never know what situation someone is in, which is kind of why I feel like they shouldn't put people through a rejection ceremony like that. They were slimy about it too. They never explicitly said results would be announced after the masterclass event.\n\nThe email said: \"Finally, don't forget that you are invited to attend X's Masterclass, where you'll receive his insights on the key important metrics to think about when developing a business, and where you'll get the opportunity to discover Y. We will also announce on that day the selected entrepreneurs!\"\n\nBut, like I say, although I left quickly, I think most rejected people stayed for feedback, so I thought maybe I was being an AH in leaving abruptly.", "I mean, grifting and scams and pyramid schemes *are* a big part of American culture, but not the part you want to emulate!"]}
