Not up for discussion. Why should you allow him to move in and create stress and chaos for your family?\n\nAlso, autism doesn't cause people to be selfish and irresponsible.

It's sad that your brother hasn't learned how to live independently, but it sounds as though he also doesn't have the basic skills he needs to share living space with other people. You can just say 'it's clear to me that I can't offer the degree of support that his disabilities seem to need'.\n\nThe truth is, he either needs specialised provision or he doesn't. If his difficulties can be fixed with some experience and a few life lessons, let him find a job and a houseshare somewhere with people who aren't you, and start learning the lessons. If his difficulties can't be addressed and he genuinely can't cope with independent living, then he needs to recognise that and look for appropriate support from social services. You enabling him by letting him move in and make life difficult for everybody, including himself, will help nobody.", "NTA. Do not let him in. Especially if brother may smoke or drink irresponsibly around your children.\n\nTell brother you are sorry, but you cannot help. You don't even have to give a reason. He asked, you replied.\n\nLet people speak.

It sounds like your brother isn't respectful, and I think you would regret taking him in.", "NTA His disability is not so severe that he can\u2019t grow up and get a job, you have kids and they come first dude.", "NTA. Tell the brother he can live with the mom.", "NTA - You need to protect your family not to mention yourself from the chaos and damage your brother has shown himself to bring. I call bs on your mother and your other brother. They know you're not being an A.H. They just want to push off your younger brother on you so they can get a break from the abuse.", "NTA If your brother was actually disabled he'd be qualified for disability. Yes, autism can make life difficult, but it doesn't prevent everyone from living their life.

Tell anyone who complains that they are welcome to take him because you will not.  Don't even make an excuse.\n\nYour younger brother has learned that he can blow money on luxuries while ignoring necessities because your mum is a safety net.  That is a parenting fail on her part.

It sounds as if brother living with you would actively harm your nuclear family, and that is NOT ok. Brother must find someone else to live with and learn to follow other people's house rules.
