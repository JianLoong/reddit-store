Like when we had a President who gave all his cabinet members  nicknames like \"Browny.\"   Secretary Brown was in no position to object to the name or suggest another one.\n\nIf MIL keeps doing it despite your clear annoyance, then she is doing it as a power play.

But I'm a bit ch that way.", "I think that some women are definitely trying to take that word back and make it into something that doesn't offend, but clearly your MIL doesn't realize that not everyone feels that way. I personally believe that you should talk to her alone once more and explain why you choose not to have your daughter exposed to this and that you find it offensive.

It doesn't matter at all if her MIL thinks she is being affectionate.  What she's *actually* doing by continuing to call her this despite being asked to stop, is being very disrespectful and I'm glad the daughter isn't going to grow up thinking that's okay."]}
