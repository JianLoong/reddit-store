The waitress was weirdly cold and bitchy the whole time. At the end, she came around to each person so we could pay individually. She brought the payment screen around to the first two people (20M and 20F). They paid for their initial meal costs. Then each time the tipping screen came up, the waitress deliberately turned the screen around to face the entire table, so that all six of us could see what the others were tipping.\n\nIt was totally an attempt to peer pressure everyone to tip high, so we wouldn\u2019t look stingy or poor in front of our friends. The choices were 25%, 30%, and 35%. Both our first two friends seemed taken aback at how it was handled and my one friend muttered \u201coh wow,\u201d and both selected 35% definitely out of peer pressure.\n\nNow, I recently had a talk with my parents, who told me I need to grow a spine and stop wasting money tipping people when I don\u2019t have to. I have a bad habit of tipping cashier workers at takeout places when I don\u2019t need to, because I get anxiety when the screen comes up and they stare me down daring me not to tip. I go to a local coffee shop every day for a coffee, and the tip options are \u201c$1, $2, and $3\u201d so I often end up doubling the cost of coffee. My parents told me to knock it off and stop being pressured.\n\nWhen the sushi waitress got to me, I was pissed that she was showing off the screen to the whole restaurant, and I started thinking how much money I waste every day tipping. I clicked \u201ccustom amount\u201d (the only option below 25%) and typed $0. \n\nHer eyes like flashed with anger, and she looked threatening, and she snarled \u201cnot feeling very generous today, honey?\u201d at me. I said no. She stormed by me, knocking into my chair, and showed the screen in my friend\u2019s face. I guess me not tipping gave them confidence, because our remaining three friends (21M, 20F, 21F) all clicked \u201ccustom amount\u201d and tipped like 15%, 10%, and $0. The waitress was enraged and walked to the back aggressively, and we heard her slam something down.\n\nMy three friends who custom-tipped thanked me for what I did because they said they would\u2019ve wasted a lot of money tipping 35% out of fear of looking broke in front of everyone. The first two who tipped 35% are pissed off because they said they tipped high out of anxiety, and it\u2019s not fair the rest of us got out of tipping high when they had to. I said they could\u2019ve broken the chain if they had the confidence, but they fell to peer pressure and lost their money.

I have more regulars than anyone else I work with.

Again, the way she handled it was bad even if you were being uncool. \n\nThe American tip structure is bullshit yes, but that\u2019s literally what we live off of. Hourly is less than minimum wage in most states. In addition, there are tip outs to other members of the staff that are not your server, which are REQUIRED even if you didn\u2019t receive tips and are usually based on sales, not actual tips. The server might end up actually paying for the time you took up at their table.  I have had it happen to me, aka having to pay at the end of my shift instead of taking home money. \n\nIf you are not going to tip your server, I\u2019d make sure you aren\u2019t frequenting the same establishment often.  If you don\u2019t tip, the staff will recognize you and no one is going to want to serve you. Whoever has to, will give you the polite bare minimum for service and you shouldn\u2019t expect anything else.  You are 100 percent not required to tip but if you\u2019re going to make that decision, don\u2019t complain about sub par service because you are a sub par customer.  It\u2019s basically just standard moral code: treat others the way you\u2019d like to be treated.  \n\nBased on your post both you and your parents want to be treated like dirt.

It sounds like the waitress was rude and pushy, but if you're in the US where waitstaff make less than minimum wage, it should be a point of principle to tip the standard amount for even basic service (did she take your order correctly, and deliver the right food to you?). You weren't under any obligation to go for the full 35%, but 18% minimum (and more if you're in an expensive city like NYC) should just be regarded as part of the cost of going out to eat. She may have been having a bad day or simply have a grumpy disposition, but it's not her fault that you routinely over-tip at other establishments, so there was no reason to over-correct when it came to paying for this particular meal.", "NTA.

Always tip based on service. But I do want to point out, tipping the cashier for take out? Please do that.

Kudos to your parents for raising you to be able to stand your ground in a civilized manner Let me just say,  the tipping culture in the anglosaxon world is ridiculous, both the peer pressure, the unbelievable percentages and how it is essentially mandatory. The only way to actually break the chain is for customers to stop tipping like that, and in hat regard take a lesson from Europe: for regular restaurants a couple of euros is enough, roughly 2 to 5% (most people dont calculate that as a percent we just leave a couple of euros as a group) for posh restaurants maybe 10 or tops 15 percent, fast food takeaway and street food no tipping at all, for delivery a generous amount. Depending on wervice you can give ehatvt you want or nothing at all, its all you choice, nobody is gonna complain to your face. And despite tipping being not mandatory, most people do tip, but a reasonable amount.\n\nGuess what will happen when customers stop paying tips. Many places will increase wages. Many, and maybe more, will not. The latter will gradually lose all their stuff, or the sector as a whole, and so they will be forced to raise wages as well.
