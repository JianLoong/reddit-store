The waitress was weirdly cold and bitchy the whole time. At the end, she came around to each person so we could pay individually. She brought the payment screen around to the first two people (20M and 20F). They paid for their initial meal costs. Then each time the tipping screen came up, the waitress deliberately turned the screen around to face the entire table, so that all six of us could see what the others were tipping.\n\nIt was totally an attempt to peer pressure everyone to tip high, so we wouldn\u2019t look stingy or poor in front of our friends. The choices were 25%, 30%, and 35%. Both our first two friends seemed taken aback at how it was handled and my one friend muttered \u201coh wow,\u201d and both selected 35% definitely out of peer pressure.\n\nNow, I recently had a talk with my parents, who told me I need to grow a spine and stop wasting money tipping people when I don\u2019t have to. I have a bad habit of tipping cashier workers at takeout places when I don\u2019t need to, because I get anxiety when the screen comes up and they stare me down daring me not to tip. I go to a local coffee shop every day for a coffee, and the tip options are \u201c$1, $2, and $3\u201d so I often end up doubling the cost of coffee. My parents told me to knock it off and stop being pressured.\n\nWhen the sushi waitress got to me, I was pissed that she was showing off the screen to the whole restaurant, and I started thinking how much money I waste every day tipping. I clicked \u201ccustom amount\u201d (the only option below 25%) and typed $0. \n\nHer eyes like flashed with anger, and she looked threatening, and she snarled \u201cnot feeling very generous today, honey?\u201d at me. I said no. She stormed by me, knocking into my chair, and showed the screen in my friend\u2019s face. I guess me not tipping gave them confidence, because our remaining three friends (21M, 20F, 21F) all clicked \u201ccustom amount\u201d and tipped like 15%, 10%, and $0. The waitress was enraged and walked to the back aggressively, and we heard her slam something down.\n\nMy three friends who custom-tipped thanked me for what I did because they said they would\u2019ve wasted a lot of money tipping 35% out of fear of looking broke in front of everyone. The first two who tipped 35% are pissed off because they said they tipped high out of anxiety, and it\u2019s not fair the rest of us got out of tipping high when they had to. I said they could\u2019ve broken the chain if they had the confidence, but they fell to peer pressure and lost their money.

I have more regulars than anyone else I work with.

Again, the way she handled it was bad even if you were being uncool. \n\nThe American tip structure is bullshit yes, but that\u2019s literally what we live off of.

In addition, there are tip outs to other members of the staff that are not your server, which are REQUIRED even if you didn\u2019t receive tips and are usually based on sales, not actual tips. The server might end up actually paying for the time you took up at their table.  I have had it happen to me, aka having to pay at the end of my shift instead of taking home money. \n\nIf you are not going to tip your server, I\u2019d make sure you aren\u2019t frequenting the same establishment often.  If you don\u2019t tip, the staff will recognize you and no one is going to want to serve you. Whoever has to, will give you the polite bare minimum for service and you shouldn\u2019t expect anything else.  You are 100 percent not required to tip but if you\u2019re going to make that decision, don\u2019t complain about sub par service because you are a sub par customer.

I am perfectly fine with having entirely neutral and polite interactions with people. They take my orders, get me drinks and deliver my food. They don't have to be enthusiastic about it, just competent.\n\nI would argue it is their job to give you helpful information, and they are probably told what that helpful information is. Servers always have their little spiel, what they recommend, the special dishes available or whatnot.", "I was a waitress for a few years, non-tipping culture. I have great service every time, was always friendly, helpful, above and beyond and all that. In smaller restaurants where waitstaff chip in with food prep and dishpigging.  I\u2019ve done it. For minimum wage, with the occasional tip which was shared amongst all staff at close. \n\nObligatory tipping sucks. Tipping creates a stupid system where you essentially have to bribe a staff member to do the job they are already being paid to do. I\u2019ve travelled a bit in the US and what I found was that the staff who go \u2018above and beyond\u2019 have fake, exaggeratedly friendly demeanour and won\u2019t leave your table alone, interrupting conversations every 3.56minutes to check if I need anything, or asking while I have my damned mouth full of food. \n\nI\u2019ve had far friendlier and more genuine experiences in places where tipping is the exception, not the norm, and where staff just genuinely have a flair for hospo work.", "Stop begging for free money for doing your basic job", "You admit you don't tip other minimum wage workers like fats good workers but expect yourself to get tips? Why? What makes your job so much harder than all the other minimum wage jobs that your career deserves even more money than those? Many people work minimum wage jobs that service customers who do not get tips. They don't get pissed off at customers for not giving them more money to pay their bills. That is your employers problem, not the customer. \n\nI haven't seen a single person say waiting is easy. I'm not even saying it's easy. It's very hard. But so is working the drive through lunch rush in a fast food restaurant. Yet you admit to not tipping them. Why? Why do you deserve tips and not them? No job will be easy. It will be extremely hard in one way or another. Most people tend to change careers if they feel they are being paid inadequately, not blame the customers who keep their job in business.", "Apart from the affordable housing, we do have reasonable (mandatory) health insurance and mostly working public transport :)\n\nI do believe that regardless of the job every person should be treated as human beings and politeness cost nothing. (That\u2019s mainly an observation for customers, I did have my fair share of the above mentioned rude idiots)\n\nOn a totally different note, have you considered changing careers and go into aviation? Still service industry but by the sound of your reply, it must pay better\u2026 no tips though\u2026", "Oh man. If this is what is considered being treated poorly then that server has pretty thin skin. Yikes.", "Lol I didn't say you did? I was simply clarifying that I agree the US system sucks. There are many here who advocate for just not paying tips because it's the employer's responsibility to pay a living wage. As if that's going to make the businesses change.", "Ah yes, the restaurant industry is well-noted for their high regard of employment law /s", "Agree! We have kids so time is a thing of the past, but i love the after dinner convos on a dinner date. Live out of the US so this is very normal and you usually end up getting a coffee or another glass of wine anyway", "Entr\u00e9e is the main course in the US", "In Europe, if your food is shit, you wave over the waiter. Otherwise they'll come to check around every 20-30 minutes to see if you needs drinks or whatever. Usually they don't ask anything if they see your glasses are not empty yet. I once had a waitress come to our table asking if we were still okay every ten minutes. Our entire table was like wtf and I had to ask her to stop just so we could enjoy our company/conversation without constant unnecessary interruption. Like I'm still drinking what you brought ten minutes ago, what did you expect?", "No they leave you in blissful peace unless you wave them over", "Not really, they'll take the order much the same way but then leave you alone unless you wave them over or they notice the plates are empty.\n\nYou also almost always pay at the front too, not from the table and no one walks off with your card which I think is wild here.", "Sometimes? It kinda depends on the restaurant. I think if it\u2019s the sort of place where they take your orders at the table then they\u2019re more likely to check in a little later. If it\u2019s a place where you go up to the counter to order food (even if you then sit at a table and they bring it over when ready) they usually ask if everything\u2019s ok when they bring the last dish out. If you order at the counter and then come back to retrieve your food and take it to your table yourself, then usually they don\u2019t come over at all.", "The usually check in  5 mins after plates have landed, then when plates are finished to see if dessert is happening.", "I\u2019m not fake with my tables. I talk to them like I\u2019d talk to anyone, maybe slightly more professional but yeah I get that it\u2019s the general culture here. Also I keep having to repeat myself but if you\u2019re a good server you can read the room, some tables want to talk to you some don\u2019t. I\u2019m cool with either.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t working in the US it\u2019s not the same thing at all. And I\u2019m glad you had a good experience, and that minimum wage was enough to live on. It\u2019s not the case now. In addition I don\u2019t work in a small space, I regularly have anywhere from 5-12 tables at a time.", "I know you\u2019re reading my comments. So I know you know I didn\u2019t say that. I said it\u2019s not customary in the US to tip fast food workers, I also stated they make more than minimum wage now because no one wanted to work there. McDonald\u2019s in my area starts people at $20 an hour. Also unless you\u2019re actually a child and not an adult I think you understand the difference between fast food work and an actual sit down restaurant with table side service. The server is literally waiting on you. It\u2019s clearly a completely different type of experience. If I was working a counter I wouldn\u2019t expect tips.", "I do feel for you Americans. How the minimum legal wage is still so low.", "Oh, thanks! In Australia an entree/appetiser comes before the main meal/secondi (although secondi is more used just in Italian restaurants). Interesting the difference :-)", "I would say the pay at the front is a 50/50 thing. Cafe (you pay at the front when you order) or somewhere cheaper like Outback Steakhouse (which funnily is not Australian, nor does it serve Australian food) you pay on your way out at the front. Nicer restaurants you pay at the table", "I mean, when I say smaller restaurants, it\u2019s 5-10 tables in total where I\u2019m the only floor staff, or maybe one other person. \n\nI think the disconnect is happening because those of us with experience outside the US keep saying that tipping is not actually necessary to guarantee good service, because loads of countries have waitstaff who are also good at reading the room, providing exceptional service etc etc but without the expectation of a tip. Those things are provided because it\u2019s a requirement of the job, the owner pays for it, charges accordingly, and if the staff are shit at all of those things then they won\u2019t get shifts and the venue will employ other staff instead.", "In Australia? I think I can count on one hand the amount of times I've paid at the table in Aus.\n\nAlso yeah, when anyone in America suggests Outback Steakhouse to me as an Australian meal option for me I have to tell them it's an American Steak place that just has an Australian skin. That steakhouses like that are an American-style thing in general.\n\nLike how the first time I ever had Fosters was here in the States.", "TF is Australian food anyway? Sausage sandwiches or whatever? Grilled kangaroo?", "Right but your pay is livable without tips in other countries where as here it isn\u2019t. Also people expect things differently here, when I went to Europe I expected long waits and I was cool with it. Here it\u2019s completely unacceptable so the time tables are different. Secondly I\u2019m also taking large parties- I do wine tastings at my job so I\u2019m often going back to these tables at least 6 times for the tasting alone (once for each wine) and I\u2019m taking time to explain tasting notes, history of the wine, fermentation style - all sorts of stuff. And I do bottle sales so I package orders and allocations during service as well. I guess my job is personally a bit more demanding than a lot of other serving positions."]}
