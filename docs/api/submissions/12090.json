The waitress was weirdly cold and bitchy the whole time. At the end, she came around to each person so we could pay individually. She brought the payment screen around to the first two people (20M and 20F). They paid for their initial meal costs. Then each time the tipping screen came up, the waitress deliberately turned the screen around to face the entire table, so that all six of us could see what the others were tipping.\n\nIt was totally an attempt to peer pressure everyone to tip high, so we wouldn\u2019t look stingy or poor in front of our friends. The choices were 25%, 30%, and 35%. Both our first two friends seemed taken aback at how it was handled and my one friend muttered \u201coh wow,\u201d and both selected 35% definitely out of peer pressure.\n\nNow, I recently had a talk with my parents, who told me I need to grow a spine and stop wasting money tipping people when I don\u2019t have to. I have a bad habit of tipping cashier workers at takeout places when I don\u2019t need to, because I get anxiety when the screen comes up and they stare me down daring me not to tip. I go to a local coffee shop every day for a coffee, and the tip options are \u201c$1, $2, and $3\u201d so I often end up doubling the cost of coffee. My parents told me to knock it off and stop being pressured.\n\nWhen the sushi waitress got to me, I was pissed that she was showing off the screen to the whole restaurant, and I started thinking how much money I waste every day tipping. I clicked \u201ccustom amount\u201d (the only option below 25%) and typed $0. \n\nHer eyes like flashed with anger, and she looked threatening, and she snarled \u201cnot feeling very generous today, honey?\u201d at me. I said no. She stormed by me, knocking into my chair, and showed the screen in my friend\u2019s face. I guess me not tipping gave them confidence, because our remaining three friends (21M, 20F, 21F) all clicked \u201ccustom amount\u201d and tipped like 15%, 10%, and $0. The waitress was enraged and walked to the back aggressively, and we heard her slam something down.\n\nMy three friends who custom-tipped thanked me for what I did because they said they would\u2019ve wasted a lot of money tipping 35% out of fear of looking broke in front of everyone. The first two who tipped 35% are pissed off because they said they tipped high out of anxiety, and it\u2019s not fair the rest of us got out of tipping high when they had to. I said they could\u2019ve broken the chain if they had the confidence, but they fell to peer pressure and lost their money.
