She has two children, a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old, and let me tell you, her methods are raising eyebrows and tempers within our family.\n\nMy sister firmly believes in the philosophy of \"free-range parenting.\" She thinks that children should be allowed to make their own decisions from a young age, without parental intervention. Which is a bit strange because we grew up with the complete opposite rules. Now, I'm all for giving kids some independence, but she takes it to a whole new level.\n\nShe allows her kids to roam the neighborhood unsupervised for hours on end, even well into the night. No curfews, no boundaries, nothing. They're left to their own devices, and it terrifies me to think of the dangers they could face. I've voiced my concerns, but she brushes them off, claiming that they need to learn life's lessons on their own.\n\nJust last week, I witnessed a terrifying incident involving her children. They were playing near a busy road, and I saw them narrowly avoid a serious accident. My heart was pounding, and I couldn't hold back anymore. I confronted my sister, demanding that she take responsibility for her parenting choices and prioritize her children's safety.\n\nShe exploded at me, calling me an overprotective helicopter aunt who is stifling her kids' growth and independence. The argument escalated into a massive family feud, with relatives taking sides and hurling insults. It's been absolute chaos ever since...\n\nNow, Reddit, I turn to you. Am I the asshole for confronting my sister about her controversial parenting choices? Should I have just stayed out of it and let her continue down this risky path? Or was I justified in trying to protect my nieces/nephews from potential harm?", "created_utc": 1688594540, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14rovsd/aita_for_confronting_my_sister_about_her/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if there are safety concerns such as letting your 5 and 7 year old children roam around the neighborhood on their own completely unsupervised, It\u2019s less of a parenting choice and more of neglect.

Having literally no rules can be dangerous. 5 I think is generally too young to be trusted to know how to be safe, look both ways before crossing, etc. The fact you saw them getting dangerously close to cars proves that.

But you said that you grew up in a strict household and this, my friend, is a great example of what happens. If you\u2019re too strict, kids either grow up to raise their family the same way (thus perpetuating the problem) or they swing too far the other way (your sister). It\u2019s ok to talk to her, but at a certain point you have to leave her be and let her make her choices. Remember, you were raised strict so what seems like too lenient may not truly be - it\u2019s just different than how you see it.", "ESH. \n\nI\u2019m a parent and couldn\u2019t imagine having the parenting style of your sister.

I have a whole other set of friends who think that the way they parent is absolutely perfect when really, they just got lucky with an easy baby or child. \n\nBeing a parent is difficult and no one knows what it\u2019s like until your kid is having a melt down in the middle of Walmart because they can\u2019t get the Bluey toy they saw.

Stranger danger is overblown to make us all afraid and ignore the real danger. A majority of trafficked children and teens are run aways. Doesn\u2019t make it ok but they aren\u2019t kidnapped. They are vulnerable and exploited. You give kids too much rope, they can get caught up with the wrong crowd. You give them too many rules, they can flee. Parenting is about balance, trust and security. Or you face the consequences.", "Are you kidding? Crime is so much lower than it was in the 70s it\u2019s not even vaguely comparable.
