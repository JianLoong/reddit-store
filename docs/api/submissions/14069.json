Anyway... we tried not to drive too far with him because it was so stressful for all of us, and I hated seeing him cry for so long. Traveling with an infant that young is incredibly difficult. \n\nI will add: If somehow you do end up going to them, get a hotel room.", "NTA, I totally would do the same. You could make the trip and just get a hotel for the night but you would still have to deal with crying for 6 hours.

The fact of the matter is that you are both in a very difficult situation. Your husband's mother has medical issues that make it uncomfortable for her travel. That's disappointing, but not your fault. You have a child under one-year-old who still co-sleeps and breastfeed (I imagine you don't pump when your child is with you). That means you are likely already sleep-deprived, which is hell on mental health. Forcing the baby to travel and scream for six-hours is unreasonable. Forcing you to be even more sleep-deprived and dealt another blow to your mental health is also unreasonable.    The situation is hard on both sides, but just as you'd be the asshole for demanding his mother just \"suck it up\" and travel with her medical issues, they'd be the assholes for demanding you and baby just \"suck it up\" and be exhausted and miserable. \n\nIs there a possibility of the two of you meeting and spending a weekend together somewhere halfway? If not, then, as disappointing as it may be for everyone, they may have to wait a bit longer for overnight visits until your child is a little older and developmentally able to handle long car rides. You shouldn't be guilted or shamed for issues outside of your control anymore than his mother should be guilted or shamed for having medical issues beyond hers. No one here is an asshole (except maybe your husband if he can't/won't appreciate your concerns about your exhaustion and mental health).", "NTA.

We left his house and stayed in a hotel.\n\nNow, I'll visit, but I will not stay. \n\nIf they will not make the accommodations for you better, then you shouldn't have to go out of your way for them either. Maybe wait until later when the kid is easier to travel.", "Suggest that he go pick them up and drive them to your home then back the next day (or whenever they will return). Yes it is 6 hrs for him each way but it\u2019s 6 hrs of peace to achieve peace.  He might consider it.  \nNTA - the child is clearly not in favor of the 3 hr trip.", "NTA. Based on your comments, it sounds like MIL is not actively dying, but traveling is just inconvenient for them due to her health. You\u2019ve already offered more than one potential solution that doesn\u2019t involve you spending 6 hours in a car with a screaming baby that also allow the grandparents to see their son and grandchild. \n\nIf those options don\u2019t work for your husband and his parents, then tough. They\u2019ll just have to wait a bit longer to see the baby, because asking you to make the trip right now is just too much for you at the current moment and that\u2019s perfectly valid. Hopefully the kiddo outgrows this phase soon and is easier to travel with in the future. I know my parents basically refused to travel anywhere more than an hour or so away for close to a year after I was born, so new parents not wanting to travel long distances to visit relatives definitely isn\u2019t a new thing or something that should automatically be expected.", "NAH\n\nWhy isn't your husband ok with the compromise that he takes the baby to see his family and you stay home? This seems like a reasonable compromise that will make everyone satisfied.\n\nI can see why you really don't want to make the trip, but I can why it's important to your husband for his mother to spend some time with the grandbaby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do you have tons of toys/books/whatever to hand to the baby every other minute to distract? Have you found any music or podcasts the little one likes? (Mine have really liked 60s pop, heavy metal and kpop.) Have you tried doing the classic \u201cdrive while the baby sleeps, take long breaks when they\u2019re awake\u201d or some other variation to find what kind of drive works best? Do you let the baby watch stupid things on a ipad while in the car (Daniel Tiger, Bluey, rangoli videos, Tim Janis\u2026)?

Get a hotel while you are there and tell them their guest room is uncomfortable, they will get the message. If they don\u2019t fix it then maybe you will reconsider visiting so often. \n\nMy husband\u2019s parents are way, and I mean WAY, more religious than I am too, I never let them interfere with my lifestyle and while visiting I keep my opinion to myself. I owe them and their beliefs as much respect as I expect them to show me and mine.

I think you offered your husband an excellent option by saying \"I'll pump enough in advance so you can go alone\".\n\nYour husband is also not an AH for wanting his partner to support him in this. The ideal situation is for you two to be a team and try to find a way for your baby to spend time with his mother while she is still around. Perhaps getting a hotel for the night would help. However, if you are not able to do this at this time, and you have to wait 3 months or 6 months until the baby is better able to handle the car, it will just have to wait. You're only human and if this is the one thing you can't manage, it's not bad of you to opt out.", "NTA. Husband's parents are husband's problem.

I will definitely suggest a hotel, it\u2019s in the middle of nowhere and money is a bit tight, but that seems the most viable option. I hadn\u2019t thought of it", "Screw that mindset. OP can set boundaries for her mental health. OP offered to let them go without her. You're an AH for ignoring that and shaming OP. OPs husband's parents will be in the car to take care of the baby while OP's husband drives. Get over yourself and your outrage at a tired mom being honest about her needs during this time.", "I agree with YTA.\n\nVery gynocentric world we live in.", "Well she not dying and has already met the baby. They have made this trip before. \n\nOp stated his mom has difficulties traveling however so does a baby. They go through stages on not wanting to be in the car. Three hours is a long time with a crying baby. Yes babies cries however like most parents they don\u2019t want to actually listen to their baby cry for hours if they can help it. \n\nThere is a simple compromise of everyone meeting in the middle, hour and half away instead.", ">The way you phrased it is strange too, \u201ca screaming baby\u201d - that\u2019s your baby. \u201cExtremely fussy\u201d, \u201cconstant crying\u201d, that\u2019s what babies do sometimes? \n\nI don't think we can judge this from OP. My baby was so mellow I didn't mention it to other mums in case I sounded braggy. He's been easily consoled from birth and he only had one or two nights of colicky crying. That was a baby who cried and was fussy 'sometimes'.\n\nSome babies, especially if they have reflux or are often colicky, cry almost all the time. Some are extremely hard to console and settle. OP's sounds like one of these babies. Honestly she just sounds like an exhausted mum who doesn't want to make life more stressful right now.", "I wonder if the baby would not cry if the husband sit in back with them while she drives", "For what it\u2019s worth my 10 month old baby is my first baby who has hated the car (he\u2019s my 3rd). He generally does fine in the stroller but what he really loves is when I wear him. He\u2019s up higher, he can see more, he\u2019s right next to me, etc. not helpful for car rides but I wear him for walks or when we go to the store. Just an idea that might help! \n\nFor car rides, not a lot helps but time. If I were you, I might offer the compromise of going but renting a hotel room so at least you can get better sleep. Doesn\u2019t fix the car ride with a screaming baby, but at least you\u2019d have some personal space while you were there.", "My oldest hated car seats as a baby.  Once he got older, we realized he got carsick on any ride longer than about 10 minutes. He probably felt like crap in the carseat as an infant too.", "This is lovely.  And the father can do this, on his own.", "Double pregnant!", "Also, ask your husband to look into renting a hotel or AIRbnb nearby if the sleeping is just too hard.", "Was it a hip? For some reason the life expectancy after a hip break decreases significantly. The ICU trips would concern me. It\u2019s kind of a tough one but I\u2019d cave on this one. You really don\u2019t want this biting you in the ass if you don\u2019t go & she happens to not make it through the next hospitalization. Trust me. It will.\n\nPerhaps kindly tell your husband that if this is that important to her and him then it\u2019s worth going through it. Then ask him if you get no sleep though you would appreciate him taking the baby so you can rest during the day.\n\nGood luck.", "Why wouldn\u2019t you get sleep if you were staying in a hotel? \n\nYou said crappy sleep is only related to the fact you are sleeping on a crappy 80s mattress. My advice eliminated that.\n\nOr make a special room or their house with their permission: \u201cWe\u2019d be able to visit more if we could modify the guestroom to better suit us now that we have a baby.\u201d \n\nAmazon prime a mattress and fan.", "Seriously. Mom's concerns aside, that's just cruel to the baby.", "Yes", "So they've already seen the baby several times in 6 months, and you already know that baby is going to scream the whole trip?  You definitely have this internet stranger's permission to say no and feel no guilt about it.", "Bad troll attempt, 0/10", "Except the OP says that the baby won\u2019t sleep without her specifically. And that she wasn\u2019t actually willing to send the baby with dad alone because she thinks that would be to distressing to the baby.\n\nShe was just offering it up as a false compromise.\n\nThis can all happen by them going together and then staying in a hotel .\n\nNot to mention, you must\u2019ve missed the part where I said they\u2019re jointly sharing in the load. \n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if OP would feel the same if it was her mother that was sick and couldn\u2019t travel to see the baby and husband was like *shrugs shoulders*", "Yep. We had a car screamer and family be damned we didn\u2019t really put him in the car unless necessary until he stopped screaming the entire time.", "Well, all right then.", "Must have pissed you off", "OP is breastfeeding and co-sleeping - her and her husband are not equally sharing the load. She offered other compromises as well and they're reasonable. At six months she is deep in sleep deprivation and to put the burden on her to travel to his parents is unfair. OP and her husband have a guest bedroom, parents can stay there if it's so important to see the baby."]}
