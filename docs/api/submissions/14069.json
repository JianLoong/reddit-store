Anyway... we tried not to drive too far with him because it was so stressful for all of us, and I hated seeing him cry for so long. Traveling with an infant that young is incredibly difficult. \n\nI will add: If somehow you do end up going to them, get a hotel room.", "NTA, I totally would do the same. You could make the trip and just get a hotel for the night but you would still have to deal with crying for 6 hours.

The fact of the matter is that you are both in a very difficult situation. Your husband's mother has medical issues that make it uncomfortable for her travel. That's disappointing, but not your fault. You have a child under one-year-old who still co-sleeps and breastfeed (I imagine you don't pump when your child is with you). That means you are likely already sleep-deprived, which is hell on mental health. Forcing the baby to travel and scream for six-hours is unreasonable. Forcing you to be even more sleep-deprived and dealt another blow to your mental health is also unreasonable.    The situation is hard on both sides, but just as you'd be the asshole for demanding his mother just \"suck it up\" and travel with her medical issues, they'd be the assholes for demanding you and baby just \"suck it up\" and be exhausted and miserable. \n\nIs there a possibility of the two of you meeting and spending a weekend together somewhere halfway? If not, then, as disappointing as it may be for everyone, they may have to wait a bit longer for overnight visits until your child is a little older and developmentally able to handle long car rides. You shouldn't be guilted or shamed for issues outside of your control anymore than his mother should be guilted or shamed for having medical issues beyond hers. No one here is an asshole (except maybe your husband if he can't/won't appreciate your concerns about your exhaustion and mental health).", "NTA.

We left his house and stayed in a hotel.\n\nNow, I'll visit, but I will not stay. \n\nIf they will not make the accommodations for you better, then you shouldn't have to go out of your way for them either. Maybe wait until later when the kid is easier to travel.", "Suggest that he go pick them up and drive them to your home then back the next day (or whenever they will return). Yes it is 6 hrs for him each way but it\u2019s 6 hrs of peace to achieve peace.  He might consider it.  \nNTA - the child is clearly not in favor of the 3 hr trip.", "NTA. Based on your comments, it sounds like MIL is not actively dying, but traveling is just inconvenient for them due to her health. You\u2019ve already offered more than one potential solution that doesn\u2019t involve you spending 6 hours in a car with a screaming baby that also allow the grandparents to see their son and grandchild. \n\nIf those options don\u2019t work for your husband and his parents, then tough. They\u2019ll just have to wait a bit longer to see the baby, because asking you to make the trip right now is just too much for you at the current moment and that\u2019s perfectly valid. Hopefully the kiddo outgrows this phase soon and is easier to travel with in the future. I know my parents basically refused to travel anywhere more than an hour or so away for close to a year after I was born, so new parents not wanting to travel long distances to visit relatives definitely isn\u2019t a new thing or something that should automatically be expected.", "NAH\n\nWhy isn't your husband ok with the compromise that he takes the baby to see his family and you stay home? This seems like a reasonable compromise that will make everyone satisfied.\n\nI can see why you really don't want to make the trip, but I can why it's important to your husband for his mother to spend some time with the grandbaby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do you have tons of toys/books/whatever to hand to the baby every other minute to distract? Have you found any music or podcasts the little one likes? (Mine have really liked 60s pop, heavy metal and kpop.) Have you tried doing the classic \u201cdrive while the baby sleeps, take long breaks when they\u2019re awake\u201d or some other variation to find what kind of drive works best? Do you let the baby watch stupid things on a ipad while in the car (Daniel Tiger, Bluey, rangoli videos, Tim Janis\u2026)?

Get a hotel while you are there and tell them their guest room is uncomfortable, they will get the message. If they don\u2019t fix it then maybe you will reconsider visiting so often. \n\nMy husband\u2019s parents are way, and I mean WAY, more religious than I am too, I never let them interfere with my lifestyle and while visiting I keep my opinion to myself. I owe them and their beliefs as much respect as I expect them to show me and mine.

I think you offered your husband an excellent option by saying \"I'll pump enough in advance so you can go alone\".\n\nYour husband is also not an AH for wanting his partner to support him in this. The ideal situation is for you two to be a team and try to find a way for your baby to spend time with his mother while she is still around. Perhaps getting a hotel for the night would help. However, if you are not able to do this at this time, and you have to wait 3 months or 6 months until the baby is better able to handle the car, it will just have to wait. You're only human and if this is the one thing you can't manage, it's not bad of you to opt out.", "NTA. Husband's parents are husband's problem.
