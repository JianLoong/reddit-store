She should not assume that you are always on board with her plans, and she should communicate with you before making any commitments or bookings.

It's cool she wants to be doing these things with you, but she still has to ask you beforehand. What if you already have plans? Or just want to do nothing for a weekend because you've been busy with work all week?\n\nIt seems you're actually willing to do things and plan things together, so you guys could make it a habit to take an evening to sit down and plan activities together. All you want is being included in planing. And she can still come up with thing and make suggestions. She just needs to wait for your \"OK\" to go through with it.", "NTA\n\nThis didn't become an acidic conflict until your girlfriend rather notably got self-conscious when you tried to communicate a boundary with her. She accuses you of having \"a go at her\" when all you're saying is, \"actually discuss this with me before assuming I've said yes and planning a trip.\" Especially, because this isn't her money she's spending, it's yours. You have every right to desire the right to refuse before a plan gets any further than hypothetical, and your girlfriend is simply, without any mitigating factors, wrong on this topic.\n\nIn point of fact I'd say not discussing this now runs the risk of you being with the spouse who likes volunteer your services to her friends and family, and then puts you in the awkward position of having to either do it or be the bearer of bad news because, \"well I can't be expected to tell them no, I already told them yes\\~\"", "NTA - you are very smart to draw this boundary now.

Do you plan and orchestrate weekend trips? Stuff to do on the weekend/holidays?\n\nBecause if you don\u2019t, then you\u2019ve made it clear to her that either it *is* solely her responsibility to do manage this stuff *or* you are telling her she\u2019s not worth the effort, doesn\u2019t deserve to have you do nice things together, and she should be content staying home, having no fun.\n\nInfo: Does she not pay at all for stuff like this? Not sure why she can\u2019t buy her own coffee at a cafe if you don\u2019t want to buy it.

For all of it. From deposit through to any unexpected fees day-of. Seems like a fair compromise to me. NTA", "The two examples you've given are drastically different. Going into a cafe in town is a really minor thing that doesn't really need to be planned out, and unless you were meeting other people there you could've just said no thanks when she mentioned it and moved on. That wasn't even plans, it was just a thought she had as to something you could do together. A holiday is a much bigger thing that requires a discussion, but she hadn't actually booked it yet, she was just looking, and there's nothing wrong with looking at options before talking to your partner.\n\nEdit: After OP responded that gf expects him to go along with the plans even after he's expressed that he'd prefer not to, I'm going NTA, with a possibility of N A H and them being incompatible.", "NTA... but she is.\n\nAlso, she is a narcissistic control freak.

And I absolutely _hate_ \"planning/researching together\". It just isn't a team sport to me. Either I do the work, or you do the work, or we divide areas where research and planning is needed and each of us works on one section. \"We\" doing it together feels like you're checking my work (or expecting me to check yours), and that is a massive waste of time. If we don't trust each other to know and take each other's wants and needs into consideration, why are we even planning a joint vacation/outing!? From my PoV, \"planning together\" means discussing every decision to death like we don't trust each other, and making what was already a chore an actively unpleasant chore. Left to my own devices, I would do exactly what your girlfriend did - and would be very very annoyed by you constantly running plans by me before they're actually fully formed proposals. \n\nOne of my closest friends feels very differently about \"planning together\". She actually _enjoys_ the research and ensuing the discussion - and time spent \"researching together\" is, to her, quality time rather a waste of time. To her, researching together is not checking my work/having her work checked, it's just sharing thoughts and experiences, and a good forum to discuss things we like or dislike. From her PoV, planning separately is a lost opportunity for intimacy/quality time - and not involving her from the beginning feels like I'm keeping a part of me fenced out/hidden/inaccessible. Left to her own devices, she would constantly run things by me before making decisions, and I would be so fatigued with what feels like a drain on my time that I would shut down and go \"you decide\" or \"maybe this vacation/outing isn't a good idea\".\n\nWe caused each other a lot of grief before we realized each of us see/hear/feel completely differently when \"planning together\". Now, we have reached a compromise that works for us - we come to each other with a solid proposal already worked out, that the other can either accept or provide a counter offer to (either the when or the where or both). But once accepted, the other person _must_ do their own research - I can't just say \"oh sounds great, go ahead and book it\" and then just turn up on th day. It still feels like a bit of a waste to me, but at least I skipped researching all the plans that _didn't_ pan out, so it's manageable. Then we sit together and discuss what we are looking forward to, what specifically we want from the trip, what we are excited about, stuff like that. This isn't natural to me, but it makes her happy and gives her most of what she wants from planning together, and unlike \"planning together\" this way of spending time feels like quality time to me.", "You cold do that too. But if one of you is \"looking at the offers in my own time and make my own mind on what I want\" and the other is \"I want to start on clean slate and discuss every detail together\", doing only one of those is not a compromise. Why don't you try with discussing a general time and idea (like, mountain vacation in February), research separately what the options are, present to each other and choose one that covers most of your wants? \n\nAlso, if you discuss together, how often one of you caves to the others wants, because they don't feel like arguing?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Because if you don\u2019t do it or do it rarely she might see it as an only way to get something done.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say **TECHNICAL** NTA.\n\nThe question posed is are you TA for being annoyed. And no, you're allowed to be annoyed at something. That's human/natural.\n\nBut I'd say you're an AH based on how you handled things (at least worded here). I don't see anything wrong with what she did (and I only see 2 examples here). She's proactive in wanting to do stuff together. there's nothing wrong with that and since you're claiming she expects you to pay, she certainly isn't prepaying for things before hand and throwing money away. It sounds like she's just trying to keep the 2 of you active and doing stuff together, exploring things. Yes, they may be more geared towards her likes/tastes, but how long have you 2 dated? How much do you know about each other? This sounds like the beginning phases where you 2 are still exploring those things.\n\nI saw in the comments when someone asked, that OP does make plans or suggest ideas himself to her and asks if she would like to. And I get there is a little difference in the approach, \"Would you like to do this?\" and \"Oooh, let's do this!\" But the difference is minute to me. OP can just as easily say, \"I don't know. That doesn't sound like my kind of thing. Maybe we can look at some other options together?\" I think she would be just as happy hearing him excited to look to do SOMETHING and not just what she picked. And according to him, she's making a habit of this (again, only 2 examples even given) and if it's enough times to become a \"habit\" then how often is OP really making his own effort? (And for the record, I 100% support days where you do nothing and go nowhere!).\n\nThis whole post reads aggressively towards OP's GF and with only 2 examples given, I don't think she's making any real habit. If the idea of plans being made \"or researched ideas\" being done without him annoys him (which I CAN understand/get), then he could have just something along the lines of \"Hey, I appreciate the effort you're putting in to ensure we have things to do. But before you go thru all that work, can we work on timing a bit more? Just check to see if either I have an idea first or would maybe like a break from being on the go or even if we have the funds? It would go a long way to making things feel a bit smoother to me.\" Instead, what I read sounded like he was just being snappy at her like he had a bug up his butt. He was annoyed and lashed out instead of talking and communicating feelings in a more calm and appropriate manner.\n\nI'm also curious as to why OP said it was \"spending *HIS* money\". Does GF not work? Does she not contribute funds at all and why not? Has it been approached that OP would like some financial assistance when it comes to the excursions?\n\nSorry, long reply, but everyone seems to quick to say NTA and the GF is in the wrong but I don't see enough to support that. Again, OP may not be TA in regards to his actual question of feeling. But he seems like one in his way of handling the whole situation.", "YTA. You're nitpicking her words, not asking for anything substantial. \n\n\"I found a place to go\" is not a binding commitment. You'd like her to say, \"I would like to go somewhere, what do you think about this.\" Sure, that's using more words and probably more polite, but it's the same thing. \n\nIt'd be a problem if she presented you with the tickets she'd bought the day of the event. No notice, no choice. That's a problem. \"I found a good place\" is hardly that. \n\nThink about what you're asking. Before she phrases anything as a statement, you'd like an invitation to consider the topic without any specific input from her.\n\nHave you tried saying, \"interesting, what did you like about it & what other options should we look at?\" That'd be horrible, huh?", "NTA. but you could slide into one if you don't adjust how you talk to her.

It\u2019s just silly.", "NTA she\u2019s found an excellent way to spend your money on things she likes by pretending it\u2019s for you both.

We always run stuff by each other, make sure nothing else is scheduled, etc. \n\nNTA.", "Absolutely NTA.

It will stop I guarantee", "I must have a different communication style because if someone relayed plans like OP\u2019s gf did above, I would take that as asking? Like visiting a cafe in town is pretty inconsequential. That\u2019s a little lunch date.

If you want me to tag along we\u2019d have to do another month.\u201d \n\nYou know how certain individuals seem to be obstinate and compulsively hate any perceived notion of being expected to do something in any capacity? Like it actively puts them in fight or flight? That\u2019s the vibes I get here, protective and defiant (at least with the examples given.) To me, it would all depend on how OPs gf acts if he says \u201csorry that doesn\u2019t work for me,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d like to do X instead.\u201d If she throws a fit then it\u2019s probably true she\u2019s unilaterally making decisions. If she goes with the flow then it seems like she\u2019s just making mental notes if things you *could* do and getting that into motion.", "I agree with this assessment. Well stated! Calm, clear communication almost always solves issues. NTA for being annoyed and valid feeling that way, but kinda AH in handling it.\n\nMy husband and I do a lot, and plenty of trips have been planned together, and plenty others planned alone and more of a \"I want to do this. You down to come?\" He wants to spend 23 hours driving and exploring small towns in the middle of nowhere? I'll grab the snacks and prep the camera. I want to check out this random historic house in Arizona I read about when I was looking for rugs online? He books the hotel and finds a coffee shop to stop by while we're there.\n\nTbf we're both adventurous and find joy in the other person being happy, so we have had the discussion of expectations which OP and his gf should have. There's fun to be had if y'all can get on the same page, OP! But if she IS just controlling, then at least you know now and can both move on.
