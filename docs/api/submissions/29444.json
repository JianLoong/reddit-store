It's understandable that you want to have a say in how you spend your time and money, and that you value your autonomy and preferences. Your girlfriend may have good intentions, but she is being inconsiderate and disrespectful of your boundaries and feelings. She should not assume that you are always on board with her plans, and she should communicate with you before making any commitments or bookings.

It's cool she wants to be doing these things with you, but she still has to ask you beforehand. What if you already have plans? Or just want to do nothing for a weekend because you've been busy with work all week?\n\nIt seems you're actually willing to do things and plan things together, so you guys could make it a habit to take an evening to sit down and plan activities together. All you want is being included in planing. And she can still come up with thing and make suggestions. She just needs to wait for your \"OK\" to go through with it.", "NTA\n\nThis didn't become an acidic conflict until your girlfriend rather notably got self-conscious when you tried to communicate a boundary with her. She accuses you of having \"a go at her\" when all you're saying is, \"actually discuss this with me before assuming I've said yes and planning a trip.\" Especially, because this isn't her money she's spending, it's yours. You have every right to desire the right to refuse before a plan gets any further than hypothetical, and your girlfriend is simply, without any mitigating factors, wrong on this topic.\n\nIn point of fact I'd say not discussing this now runs the risk of you being with the spouse who likes volunteer your services to her friends and family, and then puts you in the awkward position of having to either do it or be the bearer of bad news because, \"well I can't be expected to tell them no, I already told them yes\\~\"", "NTA - you are very smart to draw this boundary now.

Do you plan and orchestrate weekend trips? Stuff to do on the weekend/holidays?\n\nBecause if you don\u2019t, then you\u2019ve made it clear to her that either it *is* solely her responsibility to do manage this stuff *or* you are telling her she\u2019s not worth the effort, doesn\u2019t deserve to have you do nice things together, and she should be content staying home, having no fun.\n\nInfo: Does she not pay at all for stuff like this? Not sure why she can\u2019t buy her own coffee at a cafe if you don\u2019t want to buy it.

For all of it. From deposit through to any unexpected fees day-of. Seems like a fair compromise to me. NTA", "The two examples you've given are drastically different. Going into a cafe in town is a really minor thing that doesn't really need to be planned out, and unless you were meeting other people there you could've just said no thanks when she mentioned it and moved on. That wasn't even plans, it was just a thought she had as to something you could do together. A holiday is a much bigger thing that requires a discussion, but she hadn't actually booked it yet, she was just looking, and there's nothing wrong with looking at options before talking to your partner.\n\nEdit: After OP responded that gf expects him to go along with the plans even after he's expressed that he'd prefer not to, I'm going NTA, with a possibility of N A H and them being incompatible.", "NTA... but she is.\n\nAlso, she is a narcissistic control freak.

And I absolutely _hate_ \"planning/researching together\". It just isn't a team sport to me. Either I do the work, or you do the work, or we divide areas where research and planning is needed and each of us works on one section. \"We\" doing it together feels like you're checking my work (or expecting me to check yours), and that is a massive waste of time. If we don't trust each other to know and take each other's wants and needs into consideration, why are we even planning a joint vacation/outing!? From my PoV, \"planning together\" means discussing every decision to death like we don't trust each other, and making what was already a chore an actively unpleasant chore. Left to my own devices, I would do exactly what your girlfriend did - and would be very very annoyed by you constantly running plans by me before they're actually fully formed proposals. \n\nOne of my closest friends feels very differently about \"planning together\". She actually _enjoys_ the research and ensuing the discussion - and time spent \"researching together\" is, to her, quality time rather a waste of time. To her, researching together is not checking my work/having her work checked, it's just sharing thoughts and experiences, and a good forum to discuss things we like or dislike. From her PoV, planning separately is a lost opportunity for intimacy/quality time - and not involving her from the beginning feels like I'm keeping a part of me fenced out/hidden/inaccessible. Left to her own devices, she would constantly run things by me before making decisions, and I would be so fatigued with what feels like a drain on my time that I would shut down and go \"you decide\" or \"maybe this vacation/outing isn't a good idea\".\n\nWe caused each other a lot of grief before we realized each of us see/hear/feel completely differently when \"planning together\". Now, we have reached a compromise that works for us - we come to each other with a solid proposal already worked out, that the other can either accept or provide a counter offer to (either the when or the where or both). But once accepted, the other person _must_ do their own research - I can't just say \"oh sounds great, go ahead and book it\" and then just turn up on th day. It still feels like a bit of a waste to me, but at least I skipped researching all the plans that _didn't_ pan out, so it's manageable. Then we sit together and discuss what we are looking forward to, what specifically we want from the trip, what we are excited about, stuff like that. This isn't natural to me, but it makes her happy and gives her most of what she wants from planning together, and unlike \"planning together\" this way of spending time feels like quality time to me.", "You cold do that too.
