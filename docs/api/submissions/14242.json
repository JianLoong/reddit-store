Last year there was this concert that i knew my wife would like to go, but she never took the innitiative to it, so i bought the tickets and gave her as gift and i knew some friends of ours that would be going and told her to go with them, she went, she really enjoyed that, however anything like that for her is still rare. Now comes to the fact that i enjoy these social times and everytime i say i want to meet some friends for a beer or go to a specific concert, she guilt trips me and give me the cold shoulder for a couple of days, in the beginning i just didn't go out, but i got tired cause i really tried to push her to go and she still didn't, so i ended up going and usually when that happens we tend to have some small fight here and there. I don't drink with my friends every week, but it happens like once a month and usually i'm back not very late either way, the painful part is to feed the children and put to bed but even for that, i cook everything beforehand and i leave dinner ready in the fridge, so it's just about heating it up and dealing with the little monsters.\n\nSo, am i being the asshole for still going out despite my wife being mad at me?\n\n\nEdit, since everyone is asking why we don\u2019t have s babysitter.\n\nI found babysitters that our friends have used, wife doesn\u2019t want to use it.\n\nAlso we do watch movies together, go for lunch and other activities when the children are not home.", "created_utc": 1680882289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12epgbq/aita_for_pushing_to_go_out_while_my_wife_stay_at/", "score": 477, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't like to do the tourist type travel very often but have fun when we do. So, once a year, my wife would take a trip with the boys and I got the house to myself.

And I would take trips with the boys so she could have the house to herself. \n\nSounds like you guys need to have a conversation about how it's great to have kids and raise them together, but you both are also adults and need time to do things on your own too. Remind her how much fun she had at the concert and say that you both need those interactions as a small break from being a parent 24/7. Tell her what you would like and ask what she would like. \n\nJust keep in mind, that 6 and 2 are fairly young kids and some parents have a tough time making that break work.
