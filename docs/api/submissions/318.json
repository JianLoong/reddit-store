{"id": 318, "submission_id": "yisxf9", "title": "AITA for being upset with my mom?", "selftext": "I (18F) took a long 'break' after I graduated from highschool. It wasn't much of my choice but it was my mother's (59 F) choice.. I know, i'm an adult and it should be my decision but I was raised in a culture where my parents are in charge no matter what and I can't even move out yet! Now I know, either way it might seem that taking a long break before college might seem like a dream but I really want to study and get a degree.. I want to learn and slowly start my life as an adult but my mother (59F) has stopped me from applying TWICE now. The first time was when after I finished highschool, when a teacher offered to help me apply for a good college for the degree I wanted (this was when it was mostly online schooling). At that time, my mother spoke to the teacher personally and told him how we were gonna move to another country on the same year so i'll just study abroad. I was honestly excited and had big hopes, but I was so wrong.  \nBy the time we left, a year has already passed and the pressure started setting in. So I told my mom about the pressure i'm feeling and she shrugged it off as me being over dramatic. I was hurt by that but I decided to just find a college and apply, in which I did! I'm not gonna bore you with the details of applying but my mom then told me how we're going back home in a few months and how I should prepare for it. All of my held back emotions and anger just exploded and I asked her why she didn't tell me BEFORE I applied for college!   \nShe said how it wouldn't make much difference and I should be grateful to get such a long break.  \n\n\nThen she involved my dad and both of them argued with me.. I said some things and so did they. In the end, my mom just started to give me a semi-silent treatment (she sometimes ignores me or just frowns whenever I talk to her). She's been doing this for literal months now and i'm slowly starting to feel like I should've just stayed quiet and not said anything.. AITA for acting the way I did..? Or feeling the way I do? I honestly just want a outsider perspective on this..", "created_utc": 1667260401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yisxf9/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_mom/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I also feel like my mother is right about me over reacting. So I just want to see a more outsider perspective to get a better judgement of things and not just be blinded by my emotions like always. I really wanna face this like an adult and not a angsty teen who's having stereotypical issues with their parents.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
