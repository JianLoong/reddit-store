We've never gotten along, but it got better after I left. Her verbal and mental abuse put me in therapy. \n\nI (18f) recently left home for college, but I visit a few times a year. On one of my visits, I learned that my mom (38f) had taken in a homeless kid (17m). He was my sister's friend, and he was kicked out for smoking weed, something my mom doesn't care about. They had all gotten close enough that he was calling her Ma.\n\nI saw firsthand how sweet, respectful, and un-burdensome he was. He made his bed every morning, cleared *my* plate after I ate breakfast, used manners constantly, and knocked before entering every room. He even made sure not to eat my sister's gluten free food (she has celiac disease). \n\nI visited for a doctor's appointment and to catch up with my family. On the third day, I woke up to yelling and found out she was kicking him out, because he was \"distracting\" my sister, who had a messy room and had fallen behind in her grades. My mom blamed it on him, even though my sister has always had a messy room and bad grades, and she's going through really difficult therapy right now. It was just one of the moods my mom gets in, which is the main reason I left home in the first place.\n\nSecretly, my boyfriend and I started loading his stuff into the back of my car so I could take him to my dorm for a few days. My mom saw, and she immediately went off on me, telling me she'd cut me off her car insurance and phone plan, and get all 3 of us kicked out of my dorm and homeless. She kicked me out of her house, telling me I was uninvited from Thanksgiving and Christmas, and she didn't allow me to go back in for my phone.\n\nWe left, but trailed him and managed to take him anyway without my mom knowing. He was a wonderful house guest. My mom ended up mailing me my phone, and when I got it back, I was appalled to find she had gone through my photos, apps, messages, history, and settings, even updating it and tracking my location. I told her that it wasn't okay to do that, and removed the settings. She immediately replied with \"I do what I want. You're uninsured now, and your phone plan ends on the 20th.\"\n\nThis was a few days ago. I've since bought a new phone plan and insurance, but I'm a part time worker and full time student. I can't afford to do this, and now she's threatening to get my boyfriend and I kicked out of my dorm because he isn't supposed to be there, and she needs leverage to make us do what she wants.\n\nI told my grandma, and she's cancelling a $17,000 loan that was going towards a house my mom can't afford. She's already placed a $150,000 down payment, and she's going to lose it and go bankrupt. (The household, with 4 children to support, makes $120,000 a year, and they're trying to buy a $850,000 house). I feel that getting cut off for trying to help a homeless kid was a fucked up move, and now I can't afford to eat, let alone buy insurance.
