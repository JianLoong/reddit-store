We've never gotten along, but it got better after I left. Her verbal and mental abuse put me in therapy. \n\nI (18f) recently left home for college, but I visit a few times a year. On one of my visits, I learned that my mom (38f) had taken in a homeless kid (17m). He was my sister's friend, and he was kicked out for smoking weed, something my mom doesn't care about. They had all gotten close enough that he was calling her Ma.\n\nI saw firsthand how sweet, respectful, and un-burdensome he was. He made his bed every morning, cleared *my* plate after I ate breakfast, used manners constantly, and knocked before entering every room. He even made sure not to eat my sister's gluten free food (she has celiac disease). \n\nI visited for a doctor's appointment and to catch up with my family. On the third day, I woke up to yelling and found out she was kicking him out, because he was \"distracting\" my sister, who had a messy room and had fallen behind in her grades. My mom blamed it on him, even though my sister has always had a messy room and bad grades, and she's going through really difficult therapy right now. It was just one of the moods my mom gets in, which is the main reason I left home in the first place.\n\nSecretly, my boyfriend and I started loading his stuff into the back of my car so I could take him to my dorm for a few days. My mom saw, and she immediately went off on me, telling me she'd cut me off her car insurance and phone plan, and get all 3 of us kicked out of my dorm and homeless. She kicked me out of her house, telling me I was uninvited from Thanksgiving and Christmas, and she didn't allow me to go back in for my phone.\n\nWe left, but trailed him and managed to take him anyway without my mom knowing. He was a wonderful house guest. My mom ended up mailing me my phone, and when I got it back, I was appalled to find she had gone through my photos, apps, messages, history, and settings, even updating it and tracking my location. I told her that it wasn't okay to do that, and removed the settings. She immediately replied with \"I do what I want. You're uninsured now, and your phone plan ends on the 20th.\"\n\nThis was a few days ago. I've since bought a new phone plan and insurance, but I'm a part time worker and full time student. I can't afford to do this, and now she's threatening to get my boyfriend and I kicked out of my dorm because he isn't supposed to be there, and she needs leverage to make us do what she wants.\n\nI told my grandma, and she's cancelling a $17,000 loan that was going towards a house my mom can't afford. She's already placed a $150,000 down payment, and she's going to lose it and go bankrupt. (The household, with 4 children to support, makes $120,000 a year, and they're trying to buy a $850,000 house). I feel that getting cut off for trying to help a homeless kid was a fucked up move, and now I can't afford to eat, let alone buy insurance.

From the sounds of it, your mom can't afford the house in the first place, so she was either going to go bankrupt from that or from other things like property tax once it arrived. \n\nTry to apply for more grants and emergency help. If you're in the US there are even phone plans for poor people. They're not great, but they're enough to get by. \n\nIt sounds like what your mom was doing to you (making you broke)  is what was going to happen to her anyway. I don't think you're making her go broke bc she chose to try to buy more house than she could afford.  That's not on you. \n\nYour mom needs help.

What goes around, comes around. Your mother kicked you out and has continued to threaten you because she needs leverage to make you do what she wants, and now she has realized that your grandmother has leverage on **her** to make her do what **she** wants. Karma has a strange way of showing up on people's doorstep when they least expect it. \n\nYour mother said that she does what she wants.

Nip it in the bud and write a letter to a bunch of different college offices (like dorms, registrar, RA, etc) and tell them your mother is attempting to control you and that you have gone no contact and you want to make them aware that your mother will do and say anything to try and drive you home or towards homelessness. \n\nThen go to student services and find out about work study jobs or working as a regular student employee and let them know that your mother has cut you off and you are having trouble affording your cell, your insurance, your food, gas, and personal items and you need help. Be frank about not wanting to fall prey to that manipulative woman.\n\nYou might even write a letter and take it in to campus public safety and discuss the situation with security. Tell them that you are expecting your mother to call in a false welfare check or lie about you making suicide threats. Paint your mother in the bright neon colors of her manipulative witchy tantrums. Tell them of her impending financial disaster and how she will try to blame you. You need to set up a way to securely tell campus public safety that you are safe or that your mother has come on to campus to harass you.\n\nPlease go no contact. Do not try and help her out of her own mistakes. Learn about gray rocking as well as DARVO. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. You didn't cause her bankruptcy.  She is gaslighting you.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is abusive, plain and simple. Whatever happens to her from this moment on isn't because you didn't keep mum, it's because someone else realized just how awful she was and decided she was undeserving of their support if she herself is so lacking for love and compassion.\n\nShe may be a victim of trauma, but a victim only remains sympathetic until they continue the cycle of trauma and abuse onto others.", "NTA.  First off, your mother's control issues are... a trip.\n\nSecond, she does not have the money to afford that house, not even considering the 17k loan, which banks really don't like.\n\n\"I do what I want\" is something immature people say.  You're out here trying to help a kid, she needs to control everyone around here.

Be extremely frugal with it and only buy necessities and pay it back once you\u2019ve started working full time out of education \n\nBut there is most likely some aid you can get. You can also potentially go to the people that do your student loans and register that you\u2019ve been cut off so you could get extra funding, try phoning them up and asking what they can do to help, normally they can be quite accommodating", "Huh? If she needs a $17 k loan to buy an $850 k house or lose her deposit otherwise, she can\u2019t afford it. This is probably another non-truth.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
