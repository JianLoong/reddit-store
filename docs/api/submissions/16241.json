How appalling! \ud83d\ude44\n\nIt's insane that people are likening it to a wedding when it's closer to a sweet 16 or a quinceas or a debut, all of which are grand birthday celebrations.", "Do it!! I love the idea and if it makes you happy who gives a damn what anyone else thinks!", "NTA - This sounds fun AF. It\u2019s a wedding with all the fun stuff (dressing up, nice food and drink, pretty venue) and none of the boring speeches.\n\nI\u2019d be stoked to go to a party like that.", "NTA I find it really weird that people would take issue with this and call it self-indulgent. It definitely isn\u2019t more self-indulgent than a wedding (complete with engagement party, bridal shower, bachelorette party, wedding/reception, next day brunch). Enjoy your party!", "NTA and it sounds great to me!\n\nIncidentally, this is not a new idea. I don't know if you read the \"Anne of Green Gables\" series, but in the last book, \"Rilla of Ingleside\" there is a similar case. Susan, the housekeeper who has never married, decides to go on a honeymoon, and Anne is very supportive about it!", "Oh i thought you were going to have an officiant and a ceremony in which you pledge love and respect to yourself... \nWhich i see how people could find it bizarre\nBut you're literally planning for a fancy party. I'm team birthday solo trip as well \nNTA at all. Rock that dress. Cut that cake. Happy celebration!", "NTA, my sistsr did the same thing for a birthday once (she also will never marry) and it was fun. Nothing wringy with throwing a bash", "NTA, we latina girls get to have a \u201cquincea\u00f1era\u201d which is basically a wedding-birthday mix party. Big dress, makeup, photos, etc. I don\u2019t see why you can not have a big lavish birthday party! Enjoy!!", "NTA. Happy birthday OP! I hope you have a truly wonderful, fabulous birthday ball and holiday. Everyone else is just jealous.", "NTA.  Have whatever kind of party you like.  Parties don't need titles.", "> 16th\n\n> spider-man 3\n\nye gods i feel young again", "Just a small note; the only real difference between a wedding cake and any other cake is the topper. \nHonestly, a multi layered decorated cake serves way more purposes than just as a wedding cake.", "\ud83d\udc85 \ud83d\udc85", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to throw yourself a fancy party, birthday or not. You did call and compare it to a wedding multiple times in the OP though.", "Rose\u2019s BBC for short", "You just like attention. A lot of attention. I don't like people like you, but there is nothing wrong with liking attention.", "Why have people made a huge jump to that conclusion?", "Those people can do one. NTA. Hope you have a great time!", "Gala with a single L.", "my laptop wishes to thank you for the coffee it just got sprayed with!", "Stupid auto correct. Thanks, will fix it now.", "Are you Kyra? I mean what you're saying is exactly what Carrie experienced. Her life choices and she as a person were shamed by her friend, she tells her there are bigger problems than shoes. But in the end Carrie realizes that just because she's not married or she doesn't have babies, doesn't mean she can't celebrate herself."]}
