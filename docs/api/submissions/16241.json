NTA for that.   As long as you don't refer to it as a wedding, what's the issue?\n\nI threw a 50th birthday for myself.     Go forth and have a wonderful birthday.", "NTA \n\nYou can have a black tie event as a birthday party. People who are calling it a \"wedding-like party\" need to get out more. Just because that is the only truly formal event that they experience doesn't mean it's the only type to exist.", "Info:   Why not just call it a birthday party? \n\nDressing up, renting a venue, having professional pictures and celebrating life with family is all done at a birthday party.....so why the need to call it a wedding?", "NTA - You are celebrating your birthday!  Don't bill it as a non-wedding wedding.  Have a ball!", "I think it\u2019s a great idea. Don\u2019t listen to the haters. Celebrate you! NTA", "I think the way you bring it up/introduce it is strange. But the actual party? NTA! People have black tie or formal parties all the time. Hell, for my 16th birthday we dressed up in our homecoming dresses and rented a limo to go to studio movie grill to watch Spider-Man 3 (it sucked lol). \n\nJust have a fun fancy party. I've hosted fancy murder mysteries and everyone had a blast!", "NTA. You're allowed to be self indulgent, especially on your birthday.", "NTA. You can throw whatever type of party you want. Also most weddings are self indulgent so people are being hypocritical.", "NTA. Sounds like fun imo.", "Is it unusual? Yes.\nIs it something people will judge? Yes.\nDo I want to come? Absolutely! \n\nIf you have no intention of marriage, have a milestone birthday and want a fancy party for you then go for it!\nTake yourself on an extravaganza type holiday. Enjoy every minute.\n\nAnyone who isn't supportive wouldn't come if you invited them to the pub for a quiet celebration anyway.", "NTA, that sounds like a great time and it sounds like your cousin might be due for a distraction from the wedding stress. Perhaps someone else's kickass party?", "NTA\n\nYou're paying for it and I think you're doing the right thing by not getting married just to get the feeling of having a wedding.", "strange? sure. but so long as you aren\u2019t setting absurd expectations of people and you\u2019re being clear with the vendors about what this is, no harm no foul. NTA just be careful", "NTA- its not a fake wedding, its a formal dinner which is totally normal for big birthdays. Black tie event is what you need to pitch this as.  Or a black and white ball. Fancy, fun and photos :)", "nta slay icon", "aren't you just having a fancy birthday party and then taking yourself on vacation as a gift?\n\ni don't get what the issue is? but i can understand folks not being too enthused to dress up for a birthday, or have to buy something formal for that.", "NTA, It's your life and you can celebrate however you want to . Ignore any detractors.", "NTA. Different, for sure, but I think this is quite a beautiful thing to do for yourself. Life's too short.", "Stop calling it a \u201cwedding\u201c and it won\u2019t sound so creepy.\n\nJust say you\u2019re throwing a formal birthday party/", "It's unusual, but you do you.

SIGN ME UP! \n\nI would wear a designer dress of any color, rent a large venue, have a live band playing rock-'n'-roll, free alcohol, fancy food, and then I'd invite my friends the proper way, with a paper invite. They can wear whatever they want. No bridesmaids, nothing has to match, just want people smiling.\n\nThat is MY dream, by all means do YOUR thing!\n\nThere's no such thing as stealing anyone's thunder if it's on different dates.\n\nAlso, in terms of venue/food etc, everything *wedding* is 3x more expensive. Call it a birthday and see how prices get lower.", "A ball. You\u2019re having a ball. \n\nRock tf out of it.", "NAH.

A formal occasion to dress up in fancy clothing, have professional formal photos taken and spend a day celebrating life with my family and friends.\n\nNo reason you can't throw a big birthday bash, pay for the venue and catering, have a dress code and photographer. Or doesn't even need to be for your birthday. call it a celebration, or an adult prom, or whatever you like. If you invite people to a party with free food and drink there's a good chance they'll turn up.", "NTA\n\nBut stop calling is a wedding. It's not a wedding. It's a formal birthday party dinner preceded by some daytime events.\n\nWhich is awesome. Even better than a wedding in some respects. \n\nI don't know if you'll be able to get people to commit to a whole day unless you're providing an activity, but there is nothing wrong with celebrating oneself. \n\nI've definitely been to a few girl's birthday weekends at the spa or beach. My husband has done similar at a golf resort. We've gone to a couple's event for a birthday at a winery.  \n\nEnjoy your birthday celebration, it sounds wonderful!", "NAH - I'd liken it more to a prom than a wedding. People might get offended if the wedding vibe is pushed too hard. Just play dumb is anyone brings that up. You do you, but if a friend wanted me to spend a ton of money on a gift, party, clothes...ext, I would side eye them. I'd still go to the party but would not indulge all the other stuff.", "NTA - throwing a party to celebrate your milestone is a pretty normal thing to do, and using the opportunity to invite people to a venue and have a fancy event because you want it sounds like a great idea. If people do it for a wedding, why couldn't you for another life event? Go you!", "A fancy birthday party sounds like fun!\n\nNTA and have a great time!", "NTA and perfectly fine to do. People who are negative don\u2019t need to attend and can mind their own business.", "You can always throw a fancy party for whatever reason. Some people might not come, but you have full right to throw a fancy party any time you could afford it if thats your thing, kinda like Great Gatsby (I refer to the fanciness of the parties, nothing more).

(And btw, even if it WAS weird, lots of potential guests would still say- \"a chance to wear that great dress i love so much AND free food? I'm in!)\n\nDo it up and have a blast!\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nWish I was invited to your birthday! Enjoy it and celebrate!!", "NTA. although depending on timing, I could see why the other person us upset. Don't mention the party being wedding like. Call it a gala or something. Maybe say you want it to be like the met gala. And of course that only matters if you care about making her not feel bad. You don't actauly owe her anything in this regard.", "NTA. I don't understand why people are equating a fancy birthday party to a wedding. Weddings aren't the only parties to have dress codes and photographers; if they were I'd be married to my work and vendors several times over. \n\nFor what it's worth, a friend's single mother threw herself an actual wedding party, where she did describe it as a wedding: to herself. It was crazy fun and people loved it.", "What a brilliant idea. I LOVE IT. Have a real wedding.  Call it a wedding.  Go hard. Not weird at all compared to some zilla weddings", "Nta\n\nwhile planning my wedding, i had a lot of panic about it and kept telling myself it was just a big ole birthday party. this is the reverse and I fully support it. tell people its a birthday and visualize it as a wedding for yourself. \n\ni hope its magical \u2728", " It is self indulgent and a bit weird, but that's what makes the world fun.   \n\n\nGo have a blast and bang one of the groomsmen (or bridesmaid! or both, it's your day!)", "The creepy obsession women have with weddings is fucking weird.
