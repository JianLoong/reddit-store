And it doesn't even sound like a wedding, so why bother trying to create conflict about it?", "NTA. It sounds fun.", "NTA. Do you!!!!! I'm kinda jealous that you have the self love to do this or cajones.  It's honestly brave and so self loving. You know who you are and want to celebrate the goodness that makes you.... Well you. Celebrate yo self", "Nta", "I work at a high-end cake boutique. You'd be surprised how common this is! Lots of people go absolutely all out for a milestone birthday; venue, catering, huge guest count, the works. I've seen people spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars just on the cake itself. \n\nAll this to say, you're not the only one and it isn't weird at all! If you have the means and the ability to do this, and it'll make you happy and give you a wonderful memory, why not do it?", "Nta. It\u2019s weird and I love it.", "NTA! Do it! It sounds like a great time!! Single people have just as much right to throw massive fancy self-indulgent parties as couples do!", "Fuck the haterz. They wish they could have a big birthday celebration and celebrate themselves.. but they can\u2019t for whatever reason and want to make you think you don\u2019t deserve it either. Fuck them and don\u2019t sink to their level. You deserve it.", "NTA I\u2019d just be saying the gift to myself this year is a black-tie party and then going on a holiday. Yippee for me.", "I've never been a big wedding person. But everyone deserves a big party if they want one (and can afford it). So if you want your birthday to be it, do it. If some folks can't or don't want to attend, that's okay too.", "I think the words you are looking for are \"Birthday Party\". You want to throw yourself a birthday party. Anyone who is giving you a hard time for throwing yourself a birthday party on a milestone birthday is not someone you need to pay attention to. Happy Birthday, enjoy your party.\n\nNTA", "NTA, enjoy yourself and Happy Birthday!", "NTA, if you can afford it then why not have a fancy birthday party. Just don\u2019t call it a wedding. \n\nHonestly, many people spend tens of thousands on weddings when the marriage doesn\u2019t even last 5 years; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s more indulgent to celebrate your milestone with a big party.", "NTA, this sounds fun. You do you.", "NTA.  You aren't calling it a wedding, but it is a formal celebration of you and your life. So what if some things are a little \"wedding-like\"? I don't know if I'll ever have my dream birthday or even a wedding, but I like to think that I will some day. I say do it, and have fun!!", "NTA.\nBe self indulgent, be weird. \nOther people get uncomfortable with that and forget them. People who get you will go along.\nAlso? Pretty much anyone ever getting married thinks someone is trying to ruin their day or steal their thunder\u2026", "NTA! Do it!", "NTA  \nYou can celebrate your birthday in whatever way you please.   \n\n\nBut your cousin accusing you of \"stealing her thunder\" is most certainly an AH, a very insecure one at that !", "HECK YEAH DO IT F THE HATERS\n\nDefinitely NTA. It's your life, it's your party, and if they think it's self-indulgent they don't have to have cake. Share it with the people who do want to party.", "I\u2019ll come to this fantabulous party. NTA! Enjoy celebrating you!!", "Why not? Might as well treat yourself, no harm done!", "NTA, but call it a celebration of life/your birthday/your singleness.", "NTA. Celebrate life with the people you care about. I\u2019m single and don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever marry and love this idea.", "NTA \u2026 Have your party and anyone unhappy can stay home \n\nHappy Birthday", "Nta. I\u2019m planning to do this for my 50th. Formal, catered, fancy venue\u2026 the whole 9 yards. Just no groom. Is it self indulgent? Maybe. But so are weddings that put people in debt\u2026", "NTA\n\nMe and 3 friends did this together for a milestone birthday. Rented a hall, dressed up, had a bartender. It was a ton of fun! No one considered it wedding-like. At least they didn\u2019t tell us if they did.", "NTA at all! That sounds like an awesome way to celebrate your birthday!! I hope you have a wonderful party!", "Nta\n\nBut you will be if you don't have a big cake. Can't have a wedding, fake or no, without a giant cake. That's the second best reason to get married or \"married\".", "op=NTA\n\nIf you want to have a fancy Evening dress type party for your significant birthday.

Be indulgent! Spoil yourself and have the time of your life!!!", "NTA.", "Honestly, I love it. I have the same plan for 2034. I'm going to buy a big dress and have a party.

I also never got married and I\u2019ve wanted to do a similar thing for one of my big birthdays. I haven\u2019t yet, and I regret it. So go have a fabulous birthday party!", "NTA. You are an adult and can celebrate your birthday however you choose, and I think your idea sounds positively delightful. Have a wonderful time!", "NTA. Make save the date cards, get party favors. Go all out. You have no idea how many perpetually single people have done this intentionally as a wedding and married themselves or a long loved toy, stuffed animals. \n\nDo you. You are hurting NO ONE. That\u2019s all that matters.", "NTA I\u2019ve always said I was going to do this (biased lol) but I think it\u2019s a great idea especially if you take some time to take vows to yourself and your friends and family kind of like a wedding anyways!", "Who hurt you? I feel so sorry for you.", "Just call it a birthday party. And when other people make rude comments, just say, \u201cno, it\u2019s not a wedding because I\u2019m not getting married,\u201d and then don\u2019t invite people who have been rude to your fabulous party.", "NTA, you\u2019re having a big birthday party! How cool! I love it and those people are party poopers. The idea behind it is a bit eccentric, but I say that as a lover of eccentricities.", "Sounds like a big birthday party. My daughter does this every year since she turned 21. She gets all her friends to dress up in fancy gowns and they go out to dinner and sometimes she rents out a private room somewhere. This time she used the community room at where she lives and it's just gorgeous! Somebody brought a photo booth and we all took a ton of pictures. We had balloons and champagne and couple of cakes, a chocolate fountain! There was a dress code that everybody wore black or white formal attire except her who wore gold. It's a ton of fun! NTA have your big birthday party and enjoy every minute of it!", "I think this is lovely, and you should absolutely do it.", "It\u2019s your money, your life. You deserve to have a big fun party and be celebrated on a milestone birthday! I also applaud you for knowing what type of life suits you best and sticking to it. You are a complete person and don\u2019t need to ever be married if you don\u2019t want to be.", "I\u2019m sorry but this sounds absolutely fabulous. I think it\u2019s an amazing idea, especially for such an important milestone birthday. \n\nWeddings can be and usually are pretty self-indulgent and yet people praise them. You\u2019re dedicating yourself to yourself for the rest of your life. What\u2019s wrong with that? If some people think it\u2019s so awful, they don\u2019t get to come. Boohoo", "Oh this isn\u2019t weird, it\u2019s super fun! My mom did this for her 60th, though she didn\u2019t call it a wedding. She just went all out for her bday. Enjoy it!", "Other than your solo \"honeymoon\", this sounds like a fun milestone birthday party...venue, catering, fancy cake, dressing up, photographer, dj.", "No. NTA!!!! this sounds freaking amazing!!! What a great idea! And if you're heading into a milestone birthday, it is totally appropriate to have a shindig! Fancy. Formal. Dressed to impress. I assume you'll have all of the amenities? All the details? I think it's a great idea. \n\nI used to be a photographer and this IS an event I would be hired for. Your life celebrated in full, with a solo vacay to boot? Yes. All the YES. NTA and if anyone disagrees, they're just mad they didn't think of it lol I hope you have a wonderful time and Happy Birthday to you!", "NTA, but can I come???", "My friend did that for her 40th and it was so fun. Do it. NTA at all!", "Sounds like a late quincea\u00f1era. I think many of us wish we had one, why not do it when you can?", "Wait till these people find out you are allowed to throw a black tie event purely because you want to; no birthday necessary", "I mean, if they're not \"enthused\", they don't have to go.  An invitation is not a subpoena.", "I don't think any of that would make them TA. Sure it would be weird, but nobody is being forced to go.", "You have weird friends.  I had a surprise formal surprise party for my wife and people dressed up and had catering and such.  We just called it a fancy birthday party.  NTA for wanting to have a fancy birthday party, referring to it as a wedding is weird though.", "Call it a Rose Gala.", "This sounds amazing, and so much more fun and worthwhile than a wedding, frankly. The reason it might be confusing others is that people are generally dull and unimaginative so a cool event like this blows their tiny minds. Their stupid lives follow the same boring paths, so the only analogy they have for such an event is a wedding. I hope you don\u2019t let anyone make you second guess this. No offence, but it seems like you have some real losers on your social network. Haven\u2019t these losers ever been to a gala or a huge bash? This sounds wonderful.", "They\u2019re making it weird for calling it a fake wedding party. It\u2019s a birthday party, just more upscale and fancy. My moms best friend did something similar for her 50th and she is also single. She had it at a venue, fully catered, evening attire, etc. No one called it her wedding. NTA.", "Married people do this sometimes too and no one forces them to call it a second wedding.     It\u2019s just bizarre to me that a big formal birthday party has to be equated with a wedding.", "Sounds like they\u2019ve disinvited themselves from an awesome party.", "\u201cAn invitation is not a subpoena\u201d hahaha good one!", "Oh I agree. Wouldn't make them TA to do that conventional \"wedding\" stuff... not at all.  Just depends on whether one is okay with their friends thinking they are weird as hell. \n\nWhich they would.  \n\nBecause it is (IMHO, of course).\n\n.", "It would have helped if she put \"fake wedding\" in quotes", "But OP is talking about a \u201csolo honeymoon\u201d and using other wedding like language, and saying the reason she wants this is in lieu of a wedding, so I can kind of see why people are asking that. I threw a big party for my 40th, and it didn\u2019t even occur to me that it had anything to do with whether I\u2019m married. Connecting the two is odd.", "A weird birthday party.

They deserve celebrating too.\n\nOP you have your birthday ball and enjoy the hell out of it!!!", "Or if she didn\u2019t explicitly connect the reason for doing it to the fact that she\u2019s not married, and call her vacation a honeymoon", "You think your opinion is a fact?", ".....so?", "Rose got a ball for her birthday.", "Awwwww\ud83e\udd70", "Did it for you.", "Hold up. You're gonna need to spell this out.

Hired a band, country club setting, dancing, formal attire, the whole bit. She was MC for the party, and some of the time on the dance floor she danced by herself.

It was a very fun party.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re confused", "From the description from HBO: Season 6, episode 9 'A Woman's Right to Shoes' (Im only including the parts about this conflict, not the other characters)\n\n\"Carrie and Stanford attend a baby shower thrown by their friends Kyra and Chuck. Upon arriving, they discover that Kyra's house rules include the removal of all footwear, regardless if doing so will destroy a carefully crafted outfit. The evening is pleasant enough, but when Carrie plans to leave the party, she discovers that her brand new Manolos have been stolen. Later, Kyra offers to pay for the missing shoes, but balks when she discovers that they cost $485. Carrie winds up leaving the apartment with no compensation, and a sense of shoe-induced shame. She wonders if she has somehow made a mistake by choosing the lifestyle that she did, rather than the more traditional one chosen by Kyra.\n\nCarrie tries to smooth things over with Kyra, but it seems that the two won't be able to come to an agreement. Carrie then gets a brainstorm... since she's always come through whenever Kyra has registered at a store, then maybe it's time for Carrie to turn the tables. Ms. Bradshaw registers herself at Manolo Blahnik, in recognition of her just-announced marriage to herself. The only item that she registers for is a single pair of the missing $485 shoes, and Kyra finally comes around and replaces the missing Manolos.\"", "No, she asks the homeowner (the mom hosting the party) to pay for the shoes, as the she held the homeowner responsible for the theft; the mom had required guests to remove their shoes upon entering. The mom said she couldn't spend that much replacing shoes, as she was a mom know and spending that on shoes was ridiculous, making Carrie feel bad for her life choices. Carrie then lists all of the gifts she'd purchased celebrating the mom's life choices (she's doesn't take the gifts back) and says it's unfair that only certain life choices are celebrated. She later sends the mom an invitation, saying she's marrying herself, with the registry to replace the shoes.", "This exchange made me laugh!"]}
