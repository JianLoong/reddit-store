File a police report", "NTA. You could have ruined her life? Seems like she\u2019s doing that herself. Next step is to call the police. Stealing prescription medication is a serious crime. Since she\u2019s giving you attitude and denying it, time for there to be some real consequences beyond just a classmate showing up at work.", "If you know she stole them, and people who know her support this idea that she stole it too; then NTA.\n\nStealing is a crime.\nCrime has consequences.\nYou can't whine and complain for getting consequence when you did something wrong.\n\nI understand where your friends are coming from, but they're stupid. Stealing a pencil from you, sure then you're TA; but stealing meds, hell no - never TA.", "NTA. Leveling with her, human to human, might have worked better if you'd spoken privately. \n\nReport her to the head of student housing AND the real police- not campus police, immediately. \nI take both expensive and heavily controlled medications. A police report verifying that your medication was stolen will open a lot of doors towards getting you a replacement.  \n\nDuring evacuation (ca fires), I was volunteering (vet nurse) at shelters, and all my \"valuables\" were in my car (mostly top of the line yarn) as I was evacuated too. Someone broke in and stole my pill box, kindle, and a bag of cords/cables. Without that police report, I'd have been out of several meds for 1-3 months.\n\n\nYou might get a better outcome if you speak with her parents. Naturally, make it obvious that you're only interested in getting the meds back and preventing your life from blowing up. You are no threat to her or their family, people makes bad choices in college, etc.... But that you really need your medication and if she doesn't give it back, then your only option to obtain a refill is to file a report with the police and press charges.\n\nThis is no joke. Good luck.", "NTA \n\nGo to the police and report it. At the very least it will put her on their radar. Also, warn other people that she is a thief and an addict so the same doesn\u2019t happen to them.

It was unlikely she was going to admit to the theft, but confronting her about it does not make you an AH. She showed how little she cared about your wellbeing by stealing your medicine, so I don't agree that confronting her at work was out of line behaviour.", "NTA. Clearly this isn't a petty dispute but a situation of great importance. Frankly who tf cares if her life is inconvenienced or ruined (which I highly doubt it would be).

However, It was stupid to leave meds you need that badly out in the open if they are that desirable.

Report her to the police for theft. It may not get you your medication back, but it\u2019ll sure make her life hell for a while.", "I don\u2019t have any proof though, and the police have been very dismissive about taking action in similar he-said she-said situations involving student theft.", "I don\u2019t know what I can do know because I don\u2019t have proof. But I have to get my medication back somehow. I can\u2019t afford a refill.", "Is this a controlled medication? Medication theft is a felony.

File a report now, with the real police- not campus police.", "NTA.  \n\nBUT\n\nI\u2019ve been a pharmacy technician for over 15 years.  A lot of insurance companies will cover an early refill if there\u2019s a police report on file indicating that the patient reported the medication as stolen.  File the police report.  Then call your doctor and get them to call in a new script if you don\u2019t have refills left.  (If it\u2019s a controlled medication like Adderall or Percocet, there definitely won\u2019t be refills, so make sure you call your doctor.)\n\nYou need to get on top of this situation.  Stop worrying about whether or not you can get the stolen meds back.  Assume you can\u2019t and go from there.  The longer you spend dithering about, the longer you wait before filing the police report and contacting your doctor, the longer it will take to get more medication.\n\nI don\u2019t know what time it is where you are, but I would urge you to get off Reddit and file that police report NOW.  Call your police department\u2019s non-emergency line (you can Google it if you don\u2019t know the number for your city) and ask for help on how to do it if you don\u2019t know.  Once the police report is filed, ask for a copy.  Then you need to message your doctor, and let them know your meds were stolen.  Email or fax them a copy of the police report, and ask them to call a new script.  Once you do that, see if you can call your insurance company.  (The phone number should be on your insurance card.). Let them know your meds were stolen, and that you filed a police report.  They may need some information off of it, so keep it handy while you\u2019re talking to them.  Let them know you asked your doctor for a new script, and ask your insurance company if they can approve an early refill.  (Sometimes the pharmacy will do this part of calling your insurance company for early refill approval.  However, pharmacies all over are incredibly short-staffed and they may not have time.  So better that you take care of this yourself ahead of time.)\n\nFinally, if your insurance company won\u2019t approve an early refill even with proof that you reported them stolen (and some insurance companies won\u2019t), [GoodRx](https://www.goodrx.com/go/gdrx-h2-savings?utm_campaign=127243741&utm_content=7699746781&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=kwd-54255549541&gclid=Cj0KCQjwuLShBhC_ARIsAFod4fJcJQBR2b7QBkL9pMYNLeS5uZAVqO8afdhYBXIUWBQ0wK_IT2wHmpcaAsIzEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) often offers pretty substantial savings on prescription meds, especially if they\u2019re generic.  If you\u2019re on a brand med, the savings aren\u2019t nearly as good, though.  However, sometimes companies will have free trial offer coupons on their website.  You could try searching for that, or you could tell me the name of the medication you\u2019re on and I could try and find it for you.  (I do it for my customers all the time.)\n\nThe important thing here isn\u2019t who is or is not an AH.  The important thing is to get you your medication.", "Her roommates sound sympathetic to you, OP.\n\nDid you ask them to search her stuff (while she's at work) and see if your meds are there? Might be worth a try.", "Yes, it\u2019s a prescription.

If it\u2019s a controlled medication, it\u2019s even more serious. Filing a police report is free.", "You still should report it. Report it to the university as well. Get the word out that she is a thief.", "Why do you keep saying that? If you need this medication to live and you are terrified of what will happen if you don\u2019t have it, then you should be willing to do whatever it takes to fix the situation. Call the cops or quit complaining.", "Are you talking about \"campus police\" or real police? Because campus police have very different priorities (saving face for the University) versus real police. Never, ever depend on campus police.", "I am but I just don\u2019t think they will be able to do anything in terms of getting it back.", "This exactly. File a report with actual police, not campus security.", "They will 1) file a report, this is critical for working with your insurance down the line, and 2) investigate your theif as she is also a student. It's probable she is already on their radar, and your report will tip the scale. Or, if not, it will help the next person.\n\nEither you care about getting this medication back or not. If you do, you must file a police report or pay a ton and deal with insurance being am asshole about you losing a controlled substance.
