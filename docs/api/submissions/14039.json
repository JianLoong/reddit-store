Stop worrying about whether or not you can get the stolen meds back.  Assume you can\u2019t and go from there.  The longer you spend dithering about, the longer you wait before filing the police report and contacting your doctor, the longer it will take to get more medication.\n\nI don\u2019t know what time it is where you are, but I would urge you to get off Reddit and file that police report NOW.  Call your police department\u2019s non-emergency line (you can Google it if you don\u2019t know the number for your city) and ask for help on how to do it if you don\u2019t know.  Once the police report is filed, ask for a copy.  Then you need to message your doctor, and let them know your meds were stolen.  Email or fax them a copy of the police report, and ask them to call a new script.  Once you do that, see if you can call your insurance company.  (The phone number should be on your insurance card.). Let them know your meds were stolen, and that you filed a police report.  They may need some information off of it, so keep it handy while you\u2019re talking to them.  Let them know you asked your doctor for a new script, and ask your insurance company if they can approve an early refill.  (Sometimes the pharmacy will do this part of calling your insurance company for early refill approval.  However, pharmacies all over are incredibly short-staffed and they may not have time.  So better that you take care of this yourself ahead of time.)\n\nFinally, if your insurance company won\u2019t approve an early refill even with proof that you reported them stolen (and some insurance companies won\u2019t), [GoodRx](https://www.goodrx.com/go/gdrx-h2-savings?utm_campaign=127243741&utm_content=7699746781&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=kwd-54255549541&gclid=Cj0KCQjwuLShBhC_ARIsAFod4fJcJQBR2b7QBkL9pMYNLeS5uZAVqO8afdhYBXIUWBQ0wK_IT2wHmpcaAsIzEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) often offers pretty substantial savings on prescription meds, especially if they\u2019re generic.  If you\u2019re on a brand med, the savings aren\u2019t nearly as good, though.  However, sometimes companies will have free trial offer coupons on their website.

I\u2019d also go back and ask to speak with her manager. Let them know that you were asked to leave after coming to retrieve medications that were stolen, and that you don\u2019t want to have to involve the police at the workplace, but that seems to be your only option unless she returns them. If she gets fired or arrested, that\u2019s on her.", "your classmate's substance abuse problem is at the point she's stealing people's meds but you \"could've ruined her life\"?\n\nyour junkie classmate is obviously an asshole and your \"friends\" are a bunch of enabler assholes.\n\nNTA, do whatever you must to get your meds back and get rid of those \"friends\"", "YTA based upon your comments updating the situation.\n\nYou need a controlled substance medication to function. It's vital to your life. You can't afford to replace it. You've  stated that the on campus police can't help you because they've never had a case of student theft when they clearly just brushed you off. When advised to file a report with the police with just the information you have so you could possibly get a refill, you dismissed it again because the police brushed you off the first time.\n\nThia girl doesn't care about you and had you removed. You're never going to get you medication by asking her directly.\n\nI'm being blunt in the next part because you've dismissed numerous explanations. If I'm using the phrase 'It doesn't matter' it's concerning something you've excused or seemed to ignore. I'm using it to explain that you can't change the situation if you keep on excusing/putting off something thats part of the only viable solution to your problem.\n\nYour medication is a controlled substance. It doesn't matter if the police brushed you off the first time. If they don't want to do their job, you need to push for the person above them. It doesn't matter if they still you or use more excuses. You push them into giving you the person above them and filing a report with what information you have.\n\nA police report is a legal record of the events. As you've been told, you need proof to get a covered refill of a controlled substance. Anything going forward would need that report.\n\nYou can't bring an incident concerning a controlled substance to a dean or another person within the college without it. The world isn't ideal. They could dismiss you or anything they want to. It doesn't matter if the situation is hearsay, a police report makes them at least do some investigation.\n\nWhat happens to the girl doesn't matter because she doesn't care about you. She stole your controlled substance and had you escorted out when you were distressed enough to go to your workplace. By doing so, she's potentially started a narrative where you're the crazy person. If she shares it at college, she could damage your credibility beyond someone refusing to believe you about your medication.\n\nYou either file the police report or you don't. If you don't, price aside, you couldn't even get a refill of a controlled substance without someone else reporting it and potentially causing you issues. Again, it's a controlled substance.", "INFO: you're not doing enough for this situation even though you clearly stated that is very important for your health and that the meds are very expensive.\n\nYou need to file a police report and denounce the thief instead of looking for approval over a petty discussion on Reddit, act like an adult.", "NTA NTA NTA.  Anyone telling you you shouldn't have gone to her work place is wrong.  If it's medication that is desperately needed, you had every right to go & confront her.  I don't really see much you can do to get it back.  She won't admit she stole them & there's no proof.", "OP, Tell your classmate she has one more chance to give you the meds back before you call the police AND contact the school.

File the police report (with proper police not campus) and get the new prescription. And tell your friends worrying about ruining this woman's life to sod off. You need these drugs to function. You've given her a chance to resolve the situation but she hasn't taken it. She is ruining your life, so burn her's down.", "ESH, esp her. Despite her conditional phrasing, she essentially admitted the theft.\n\nYour coyness about the medication is a bit off-putting.  I assume that it was an amphetamine stimulant, an opioid pain med, an anxiolytic like alprazolam, or a prescription cannabinoid, and she stole it for recreational use or resale --because she would not have likely stolen your urinary antibiotic or acne medicine, and if it was insulin or something similar you would have named it. Your \"I need it to function\" is a much less persuasive argument than \"It was my property, not easily or cheaply replaced.\"\n\nConfronting and accusing someone at their workplace was unlikely to be successful because your intrusion caused harm (interruption, drama, uncertainty of your behavior limits) to her coworkers, who were unlikely to immediately take your side.\n\nYou had a couple of choices. First might have been a private confrontation with a credible \"or else\". The most effective \"or else\" would probably be telling as many of her acquaintances and relatives about her theft and refusal to return it with a report to the dorm authorities or campus police.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.

I will say that when my niece arbitrarily stopped taking her ADHD meds (long story involving  parents who wanted to teach her responsibility by making a 19 year old pay for her own meds while she was also away at college and ended up choosing to eat rather than pay for the meds) she lost an entire year of college credits and had to come home to the community college to rehab her grades.
