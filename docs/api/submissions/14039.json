A lot of insurance companies will cover an early refill if there\u2019s a police report on file indicating that the patient reported the medication as stolen.  File the police report.  Then call your doctor and get them to call in a new script if you don\u2019t have refills left.

Stop worrying about whether or not you can get the stolen meds back.  Assume you can\u2019t and go from there.  The longer you spend dithering about, the longer you wait before filing the police report and contacting your doctor, the longer it will take to get more medication.\n\nI don\u2019t know what time it is where you are, but I would urge you to get off Reddit and file that police report NOW.  Call your police department\u2019s non-emergency line (you can Google it if you don\u2019t know the number for your city) and ask for help on how to do it if you don\u2019t know.  Once the police report is filed, ask for a copy.  Then you need to message your doctor, and let them know your meds were stolen.  Email or fax them a copy of the police report, and ask them to call a new script.  Once you do that, see if you can call your insurance company.  (The phone number should be on your insurance card.). Let them know your meds were stolen, and that you filed a police report.  They may need some information off of it, so keep it handy while you\u2019re talking to them.  Let them know you asked your doctor for a new script, and ask your insurance company if they can approve an early refill.  (Sometimes the pharmacy will do this part of calling your insurance company for early refill approval.  However, pharmacies all over are incredibly short-staffed and they may not have time.  So better that you take care of this yourself ahead of time.)\n\nFinally, if your insurance company won\u2019t approve an early refill even with proof that you reported them stolen (and some insurance companies won\u2019t), [GoodRx](https://www.goodrx.com/go/gdrx-h2-savings?utm_campaign=127243741&utm_content=7699746781&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=kwd-54255549541&gclid=Cj0KCQjwuLShBhC_ARIsAFod4fJcJQBR2b7QBkL9pMYNLeS5uZAVqO8afdhYBXIUWBQ0wK_IT2wHmpcaAsIzEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) often offers pretty substantial savings on prescription meds, especially if they\u2019re generic.  If you\u2019re on a brand med, the savings aren\u2019t nearly as good, though.  However, sometimes companies will have free trial offer coupons on their website.  You could try searching for that, or you could tell me the name of the medication you\u2019re on and I could try and find it for you.
