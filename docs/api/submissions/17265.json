I'm a big car guy and, during a dip in the exotic car market, was presented with an insane private market deal on an extremely rare manual transmission supercar (original owner was a friend in a car club who passed, his kids handled the sale).\n\nI had just enough cash available for a down-payment to buy it as an investment. Not ready to disclose the model just yet (fellow gearheads can probably guess), but it is one of less than 200 remaining in North America, low mileage, all original without a hint of damage. I honestly rarely even drive the thing myself - it's just too valuable at this point, worth more than triple what I paid for it (let's just say it's easily valued north of $600K right now).\n\nOr at least it was. Last weekend, while I was out of town, my idiot 17-y/o step-brother had his prom and decided to borrow it for the evening. I don't think he was even drinking, the car is just not easy to drive - it doesn't have any safety features and is tough to handle for anyone less than an experienced driver. He ended up misshifting, spinning it out and causing a fair amount of damage. It was still driveable afterwards and he brought it back to my garage, so no accident report was filed, but my cameras caught him leaving with it in pristine condition and returning it wrecked.\n\nI'm livid. My dad and step-mom are very apologetic, but aren't really taking much responsibility for what he did. Originally they wanted me to try and claim it against my insurance, which I have no intention of doing. They eventually came back and offered to try and pay for the repair (I think it can be fixed for under $60K, but finding parts for the thing isn't a cakewalk).\n\nMy problem is the loss of value. I had a broker that specializes in these cars go over it with me, and he thinks, even expertly repaired, with the wreck and non-original parts it will have lost $2-300K in value after being restored.\n\nThe broker is going to provide me with a written loss of value estimate this week. I'm leaning towards demanding that amount from the family in restitution, or I press charges for the theft of the vehicle. As far as I can tell, those are my two options to seek the full value of the investment. Just getting it repaired would mean taking a $250K+ loss when all is said and done.\n\nI know this would be a hardship, but my dad and step-fam won't exactly go hungry. They own a couple rental properties they could sell to come up with the cash. But in discussing this with my sister, she thinks I'm being unreasonable to burden the family with such a major expense and I should just let them pay to fix the car.\n\nI don't see how I can even remotely cover the loss I'm taking without pushing this ultimatum their way. WIBTA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: To clarify because I keep getting asked - the car was on my own property in my garage and was very well secured, but my dad had a key to the house that my step brother used to get in. He knew the alarm code and where the keys were hidden because, well, family.\n\nAlso, this probably wasn't too clear in the original post, but I'm not exactly wealthy or anything. At least not wealthy enough to afford my own supercar under normal circumstances. This was very much an investment towards retirement for me, hence why I almost never drive it.

You should be able to leave your property inside your garage with the expectation that it won\u2019t be stolen!", "NTA - I'd honestly have pressed charges already. He stole your car and caused massive damage, let alone the safety factor! He could have gotten himself and/or others severely injured or even killed operating a car he had no business being behind the wheel of, frankly he's lucky that was the worst that happened and their apologies don't cover all that. You're being generous giving them different options to work it out that don't include charges.\n\nAlso, what are they doing about him? Because if they haven't properly grounded him from literally everything, taken away his phone and any gaming devices, and told him he IS getting a job to help pay this back, it's not enough!", "I'm not sure what to advise at this point.  Your step-brother should not have stolen your car, no matter what it is.  So he's liable for that.  I would be pressing charges for it *and* suing for damages.  I don't know if a court will give you loss of value, but at least they should give you the cost of repairs at least.  But I'm no lawyer.  But I'm going with NTA.", "NTA-  press charges .\n\nThat little thief is old enough to know better . \n\nYour parents know that he\u2019s old enough to know better.\n\nThey will let this slide and you will never get your money back.\n\nPress charges. Only way to guarantee something is done about this.", "Just go to the police. You will never get the value from them.", " I\u2019d be putting it to them. Your father was in charge of the keys\u2026 it was up to him to secure it. Have the car valued now (with all original parts\u2026to prove they were there) pre accident and post accident! That will end the speculation. Do it twice or three times. Courts accept the opinion of experts all the time. See what they say. I would also see a lawyer. Don\u2019t threaten to have them charged, just put it to them to pay. Could be seen as blackmail otherwise.", "NTA\n\nHe decided to borrow the car for his prom, but he didn't ask you or get permission. How did he come into possession of the keys? How did your parents not see him leave with your car? How is this your problem that he stole your car?\n\nRemove the relationship from the equation and you would not be second guessing the right thing to do. Realistically based on the act, he would likely receive probation and have to pay restitution. Your parents would have to make you whole. Putting it through your insurance would be fraud. Pursuing the theft would shift the issue to the justice system and insurance company.\n\nSome decisions cost major dollars. If he would have killed someone or even himself, who would cover the bill? \n\nAs an investment, you may be able to recover the loss on taxes, but that will cost you too.", "NTA. It seems like the right course of action. Do they expect you to pay for someone else\u2019s wrong doing? Ludicrous.", "YWNBTA, but talk to a lawyer to find out about the legality of not filing a report concerning a serious accident, and about statutes of limitations.", "Nta\n\nI feel that people saying y t a are missing the fact (as it was only mentioned in comments) that OP's dad had the keys to the house. Stepbrother got them from him.\n\nTo me that increases the level of culpability for the parents.\n\nThey have parental responsibility and the thief got keys from them.", "NTA he should be held accountable for his actions. Although if the car is worth as much as you say, you should've done a far better job of protecting it as well. A 17-year-old shouldn't have that kind of easy access to a car worth that much if you really care about it.", "INFO - how did he gain access to the vehicle? Surely an investment property would be pretty much clamped and immobile?", "Oh for the love of god please tell me it's not a LP5000QV or a 25th \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA sue for the money and press charges.  He stole the car and tried to hide what he did.  You also need to report this as there may be damage to property, as in what did he hit to cause the damage. As it was your car they could come after you clamming you tried to \"Cover up\" what he did by not reporting it.", "NTA,\n\nMake the step-brother get a job and start paying it back. That should help him realize just how hard he's fucked up.", "NTA. It's not just a car, it's an investment. \n\nAsk your family this - if step-brother had burned down your investment rental property and they offered to replace it with a mobile home would it be a fair replacement? Because that's what they're saying.", "Just report him to police and be done with it. Stop beating around the bush", "**NTA**    \n\nYou should report it to the police.  The 17-year old will probably going to get a slap on the wrist and a sealed record.", "NTA.   Something needs to be done and your alarm codes and door locks changed too.    You can't trust them with your house ever again.    \n\nWhat are your area's rules on reporting accidents?   Could you later be held responsible yourself for failure to report?\n\nI don't think I'd easily stomach making them sell properties outright, but I'm probably too nice.  But if they weren't family that is the type of deal you might offer and be seen as more than fair to them.   You should not have to take a loss because of this.  Anything you didn't recoup would be a massive gift to them, although it sounds like they more take it for granted.  \n\nDo you think your dad was involved in stepbrother getting the keys?", "NTA, take it to your dad/step mum and say here are the options, as you presented them.\nDoes step bro have a college fund? Maybe it could partially pay for it, plus it would be direct consequences for his actions. He knew it was wrong and didnt own up hoping he wouldnt get caught. If he had come to you and told you the truth, apologised and offered to work out a payment plan to get it fixed (cause I assume he is unaware of how much it was valued at etc) I would be more inclined towards working with them. But he did the opposite basically, so, to me at least, actions have consequences.", "NTA\n\nBut maybe just present them with the paperwork showing lost of value and see what THEY come up with\n\nBut shouldn\u2019t THEIR insurance cover everything? Even if he had had permission?", "Oof. First off I understand the frustration. And am really sorry that such a beauty was damaged. But the question really is are you at a loss if you sold it even at the loss of value after repairs. Rn it sounds like you want the family to pay for the SPECULATION of full value. \n\nImo YBTA. Im betting you put ~$200k into the purchase. Even at a 50% loss of value off of $600k you\u2019re still up $100k. Forcing the family to sell property (in subprime markets) is ridiculous. And not to mention the fact that the car was available to be \u201cstolen\u201d is owner negligence. I think you have every right to be absolutely livid at your sibling AND your parents if there isnt some serious consequences. But you\u2019re threatening a record or severe financial burden on your family for at its worst angle, hampering your portfolio. Asking them to liquidate theirs or even threatening the legal consequences is a bridge too far imo. Your sibling is a kid. Lock up your toys Forsure in the future on top of your sibling should be worshiping the ground you walk on and spit shining that car until he goes to college or whatever. \n\nImo take the repair money. Make the sibling clean the car for like 2 years whenever you want as a form of repayment. Or something along those lines. Make it brutal manual labor if possible. And possibly see about insurance compensation.", "YTA I mean seriously there are other ways to do it besides holding your parents responsible when they didn't do anything, work it out with your step brother. Make him set up a payment plan. Eat the loss because apparently you didn't exactly have the thing locked up either, which you easily could have.", "YTA but not for the reason you think. Are you really threatening them with a grand larceny charge for the kid? You realize that you would be choosing to ruin your step-brother's life for a car, right?  \n\n\nAnd let's keep in mind that you left a supercar where a 17 yr old had access to it. That's pretty negligent if you ask me. Split the costs with them (repairs and lost value) and allow them to pay you in increments so they don't have to sell anything. Remember, it's the kid that is responsible and you'll likely get nothing if you press charges depending on where you live.", "You can't afford it? You said it tripled in value to over 600k, so if it loses 300k then it's still worth more than you bought it for.\n\nIf profit is worth more to you than your family, go ahead and charge him. Ruin his life for one (extremely stupid) mistake. If he's not taking responsibility, how will your dad paying for it help that situation? Have you even considered payment plans, or getting it revalued once fixed to see how much it's actually gone down in value?\n\nOne day you just might be lucky enough to be the richest person in the graveyard.

I have no idea why OP trusted the 17 yr old with access to anything of his, but the fact that he just leaves the key to a $600,000 supercar laying out, even in his own home, is just insane to me.

Especially in real estate and investment. The property is evaluated based on several SUBJECTIVE factors that are mostly market driven. \n\nRecent sales of similar builds in the neighborhood, square footage, age of construction, access to transportation, interest rates etc. \n\nIn depreciating assets such as vehicles it\u2019s even worse. The value of the car is based on what a private investor would be willing to pay. Not it\u2019s actual cost to replicate, or anything tangible. Perfect example. OP claims vehicle is worth $600k,  it he bought it at 1/3 of the price (estimated) there is no way to PROVE that value. It\u2019s speculative. Without a buyer coming in and saying I WAS going to buy it at X price. But then, the buyer would be happier taking the lower price themselves (as OP was in buyer friendly market conditions) \n\nAll of this is to say that OP is stretching the argument already claiming it was an \u201cinvestment\u201d vehicle in the first place. \n\nAbsolutely valid statement. But EXTREMELY speculative. \n\nOp is asking for more secure assets in exchange for a highly speculative asset. \n\nA better example would be \n\nImagine OP bought $200k of stocks. Random stock in one company. The markets in a bull run and that stock is then LATER valued at $600k. Then still later some CEO comes in and slashes the value of that to $400k. OP wants to sue for $200k. For irresponsible management of the company. OP would not be entitled to $200k of stock value. Even if OP won. He would be entitled to court fees and the CEO would suffer legal consequences, which may amount to a fine and jail time but the fine goes to the courts. And the court fees are paid to the courts and lawyers. Most likely initially by OPs gained stock value of $200k from his initial position. \n\nOP loses in all legal scenarios. Parents offered essentially the max financial coverage OP would ever expect to get. From legal relief, insurance, or even by out of pocket expenses for the repair of the asset. It\u2019s fucked.

Likely not, but he will get a fair chunk. And the step bro will have to delay his launch into adult life for a good few years, but he won't spend his entire life in debt and will have a financial future that isn't tied to paying off a huge sum that will frankly accrue interest much faster than he can pay it off. And maybe that will teach him to keep his hands of stuff that isn't his; if it isn't yours, you don't know the full ramifications of using it and what it could trigger behind the scenes. Sounds like a lot of people haven't learned that lesson as thoroughly as they think.\n\nAnd after all this, the op should look into secure storage for the car; not to prevent it happening again, but because the car was taken *to show off*.

The only ones who damaged the relationship here is the 17-year-old who stole the car, and knew better than not two because let's be honest at 17 you know better, and the parents who are trying to talk OP out of getting the money that they are owed.\n\nOpie will not be the one destroying the relationship by pressing charges. The family already did that.", ">You for getting an insane private market deal on a car from kids whose dad just died.\n\nhow on earth is OP the AH for this? the car was being offered for X price. if OP didn't buy it, someone else would have.", "Why does OP suck for having a rare opportunity?  It's not like he killed the dad.", "Oh he is not going to be ruining his life. The 17-year-old did that when he made the decision to steal the car. At 17, you know better than to steal a car. It was not a mistake. That was a deliberate choice that he made. You don't accidentally steal somebody's car, it's a deliberate decision.\nAnd clearly you did not read the post, because they did get it revalued, and with getting it fixed it loses over 250 grand in value. The value of the car has now gone down significantly, and that is 100% the 17-year-old fault. Not a mistake, a deliberate choice that they made.", "At 17 years old you know better than to steal a car. His stepbrother ruined his own life by making a deliberate decision to commit Grand theft Auto, which is exactly what this is, destroy the car, then try to not even own up to what he did.\nI don't know about you, but family or not somebody who does that to me is definitely going to be held responsible. You don't get to just skirt responsibility by claiming your 17 and didn't know better. If that's honestly true, then your parents are held to blame because they should have taught you better, and somebody is going to be paying for the repairs, and for the money that I lost.\n\nOh he is not the one ruining the familial relationships here. The 17-year-old stepbrother is by committing a crime, and expecting OP to just forgive it.", "And exactly why should OP have locked up the car? Why should OP be the one who eats the loss for their stepbrothers decision? It's 17 years old you know better than to steal a car. At 17 years old you are open up to be held accountable for your actions.\nThis is victim blaming at its finest. Are you the step brother by chance? Or maybe one of his friends?", "Sincerely, I would have filed charges already. He took your vehicle and caused huge harm, not to mention the security factor!", "The real questions is what was the car wearing? Maybe it was asking to get stolen and crashes.", "Yes the multi thousand dollar coat! Shudder.", "One thing you\u2019re missing; if OP makes an insurance claim on an exotic car, he can likely never again own or insure an exotic car. And it will obliterate his policy rates for the rest of his life on regular cars. \n\nExotic car insurance policies are insanely expensive. And, while you\u2019re fully allowed to make a claim on those policies, if you do make a claim, it is a near 100% certainty that you will be denied any further coverage after the claim. They phrase it as \u201cinviting you to not renew.\u201d", "And don't mind everybody trying to discourage you from getting back what you lost. Since your step-brother can just \"decide\" and take your property, why shouldn't you \"decide\" to fight for evening things out? He didn't even bother to inform you bout it, he just took it and tried putting it back like nothing happened.", "OP needs to sue the parents for the repairs and loss of value. They had custody of the key that was used for the theft, plus they were responsible for the actions of the minor.\n\nI have serious questions about how the key was stored and the father's involvement.", "Not the Countach! \n\nNTA. Press charges immediately and sue them.\n\nLove, a petrolhead.", "Omg, my condolences", "Okay as a petrolhead I might be a little biased, but dude... Sue the everliving shit out of them. You don't mess with one of those cars man. My heart breaks for you and the car. I hope you can at least repair it and still enjoy it personally, even with the loss of value that you should be getting back from them.", "YTA if you dont press charges now \n\ni get there family but your step mom and step bro are thieves", "lets not hurt the car more by keeping the association with step bro", "If he files a police report they will prosecute the stepbrother and OP will not have to pay for a lawyer unless he wants to. The kid will legally have to begin making payments as restitution until it\u2019s paid off or he could go to prison (17 is legally adult charges in my state). The kid had no problem stealing a car worth over a quarter million dollars and the parents will allow OP to lose his investment to protect the other son, that relationship doesn\u2019t sound the best as it is", "They didn't even buy the car, that's just the value reduction because of this mess.   \n\nI still want to know how stepbrother got the keys to the house.", "Do you \"hide,\" your keyring?

If you amortize the risk of *total loss*, which seems to be high (since it's almost already happened once) then the expected yield probably isn't much worse than $600,000 in an index fund over the same period, but a lot safer.", "It might be illegal or void OP's insurance to fail to report such a serious incident.", "Not sharing the code with everyone in his family would be a good start.", "I can point out all day the fact that he didn't do enough to keep his car safe. He's responsible for the safety of his own vehicle. He obviously trusted the wrong individuals with codes to access the vehicle. Had he done a better job at that aspect his car might still be safe so it's reasonable to ask what precautions he took or come to the conclusion that he didn't take enough based on the fact his car was borrowed by someone within his own family.", "Im not saying it would be his fault. Of course it wouldn\u2019t be. Im just saying that will likely be the outcome (but still not his fault). Now he has to decide on whether he cares more about being right (which he is) and his money, or his relationship with his family. Either choice is valid. There is also the middle ground of charging them half of it/only for repairs.", "Unfortunately the sucky part about being the adult in the situation means you have to be the mature and levelheaded one. \n\nWhich is also why it depends on what the little brother has done afterwards. \n\nOP have no indication of if this was a one time reckless decision or part of a pattern for the brother. \nIf this is a pattern of the brother then my opinion would change. \n\nTeenagers to really stupid and reckless things all the time. \nIt\u2019s why I don\u2019t understand how in the US the driving age is so low.", "If the children of a friend who has just died offered me great, private market deal, I\u2019d offer to help them sell the car for as much as possible.", "Did your stepbrother know you were out of town?

Not sure about anyone else but that kind of number makes me gasp. That\u2019s a very decent retirement for anyone. Holy cow. \n\nJudgement: NTA I\u2019d give the parents the breakdown (with an attorney present) of their options\u2014with a signed contract that can\u2019t be declared as a bankruptcy to prevent them paying OP back.

Dude stole the car, fucked it up, then just returned it with, presumptively, no intent of admitting his wrong doing. Just fucked up on multiple levels.

I have the spare key of two of my best friends, neither is on my key ring", "Depends on how high value the item is. \nHigh value insurance companies do do this because it lowers their risk of having to pay out. So it pays them.", "Uhm, it wasn't borrowed--it was stolen. Step brother took the house key and alarm code, entered without permission, and then took the car. OP took reasonable precautions and now step brother and family are going to have to live with the consequences of his actions.", "Thats absolutely not an example of an attractive nuisance.  Find one case thats similar", "If I did not give permission for you to take my car, then you did in fact steal it not borrow it. If the 17-year-old really didn't understand the difference, then yes that is 100% on the parents for not teaching their kid right from wrong. And therefore the parents will be held responsible. Either way, somebody needs to be held responsible for Grand theft Auto and damages. Because that's exactly what this was. It doesn't matter that the car was returned, it was stolen in the first place.\n\nAnd we have all made up our minds about responsibility. We can't help it if you don't understand the idea that the only person responsible for a crime is the person who committed it, not the person that it was committed against.", "The person who got their car stolen is never the person at fault. You realize that all you did is victim blame here right?\nOpie leaving it where the kid had access is not their fault. The kid knows better whether or not to steal a car. That's basic common sense, you don't take something that doesn't belong to you without consent.\n\nAnd once again, the only person who destroyed the relationship between this family is the person who committed Grand theft Auto, not the person who's going to be holding the responsible for it.\n\nYou really just think that because this kid is 17 he should just get away with this choice. Not a mistake, a deliberate choice that he made.", "That doesn't mean that it was in any way oh peacefault that their car got stolen. The victim is never to blame for these kinds of situations, the only person to blame is the idiot who stole the car. Once again, at 17 years old you know better than to steal a car.", "Did you really just repeat that persons comment back to them lol?", "Is this a bot? It\u2019s exactly the same thing as the parent comment", "Why are you repeating Hot_Sorbett's comment?", "\u201cDiminished Value\u201d is absolutely a legal concept and courts enforce it all the time. After a car accident a few years ago someone even sued my family for the same - the insurance company settled.", "That was my immediate thought. For prom, it's not uncommon to want your kid to have possession of the nicest car in the family to make the experience more special for them. My dad forced his sportscar onto me even though I wasn't a car-head and driving the thing terrified me. .My intuition would even say this was Dad's idea. Kid's not in trouble because it was probably a very minor and understandable accident (which is only unfathomably expensive because of the collector's aspect of things) and the parents wanted the kid to take the car.", "My keys to other people's houses are on their own keyring in the junk drawer because I don't want to carry around a ton of keys everywhere that I rarely use. I wouldn't notice if someone took the entire set of them because I don't carry them around regularly.", "Yes, it is, unless you happen to have your keys on you 24/7.\n\nOh, you hang them up on a hook by the door and go watch TV in the living room or something?  Easy peasy to slip one off the ring.", "YWNBTA, but did you really just repeat that persons comment back to them lol?", "A bot maybe??", "Might be.

That's right, I didn't ask\" \nAll that's going to do is just literally admit that they stole the car. The intent does not matter as much as the end result, which is that the car was stolen, it was damaged, and somebody once again needs to be held responsible. And the only person responsible for that is the person who stole the car, how do you not understand that? No one is at fault for being robbed. No one is at fault for being the victim of a crime. The only person responsible for a crime is the person who commits it. If you can't understand that, then I seriously have no hope for you.", "That is not necessarily true. As long as OP said no, then they did not allow family to have access to the car. Just because the key was not locked up, does not mean that OP gave them access to the car. By saying no, OP revoked access. Not locking up the key does not automatically consent to giving access to the car.\nYou really seem to be in favor of blaming the victim.", "Okay, but what about pictures? You\u2019re telling me Mom didn\u2019t wanna take a million pictures of her kid on prom night? The logistics of getting this to work would have to be IMPRESSIVE for the kid to not get caught before driving off to prom with the car. And given Mom and Dad\u2019s rather calm reaction to the events, it is at least worth considering that Mom and Dad had a say in things.", "OP has been left with substantial damage to their retirement investment. They deserve to be made whole, and a 17 year old is more than old enough to face the consequences of their actions.", "It isn't OP who's causing the harm. It's the 17-year-old's own actions. Frankly, he's lucky it didn't turn out worse.", "It\u2019s much cleaner than suing him directly. And it is very possible that the insurance company will not go after a minor, but after the minor\u2019s parents. At least in the US.", "Lol so OP should take a 250k loss? Spin this question the other way why would his stepbrother break in and steal from OP why would he do that for his brother? And why should OP now ha e sympathy for someone that had zero respect for his property.", "The kid also failed to report the accident, returned the car and never told OP.", "Possibly but then would the terms the insurer sets on the parents because something they can afford. \n\nI think it bares more thinking. \n\nObviously it\u2019s a huge amount of money and OP. Is rightfully angry. \nI think the best idea right now is to seek counsel and not make any decisions until they have more info and some time to calm down a bit.", "Because 17 year olds are stupid, with under developed prefrontal cortexes. \nAnd therefore have little to no foresight or impulse control. \n\nHe said the family can afford to pay him back. But he should do some research first to make sure OP knows what they are and is ok with the unintended consequences of reporting or claiming from insurance."]}
