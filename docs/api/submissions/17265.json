I'm a big car guy and, during a dip in the exotic car market, was presented with an insane private market deal on an extremely rare manual transmission supercar (original owner was a friend in a car club who passed, his kids handled the sale).\n\nI had just enough cash available for a down-payment to buy it as an investment. Not ready to disclose the model just yet (fellow gearheads can probably guess), but it is one of less than 200 remaining in North America, low mileage, all original without a hint of damage. I honestly rarely even drive the thing myself - it's just too valuable at this point, worth more than triple what I paid for it (let's just say it's easily valued north of $600K right now).\n\nOr at least it was. Last weekend, while I was out of town, my idiot 17-y/o step-brother had his prom and decided to borrow it for the evening. I don't think he was even drinking, the car is just not easy to drive - it doesn't have any safety features and is tough to handle for anyone less than an experienced driver. He ended up misshifting, spinning it out and causing a fair amount of damage. It was still driveable afterwards and he brought it back to my garage, so no accident report was filed, but my cameras caught him leaving with it in pristine condition and returning it wrecked.\n\nI'm livid. My dad and step-mom are very apologetic, but aren't really taking much responsibility for what he did. Originally they wanted me to try and claim it against my insurance, which I have no intention of doing. They eventually came back and offered to try and pay for the repair (I think it can be fixed for under $60K, but finding parts for the thing isn't a cakewalk).\n\nMy problem is the loss of value. I had a broker that specializes in these cars go over it with me, and he thinks, even expertly repaired, with the wreck and non-original parts it will have lost $2-300K in value after being restored.\n\nThe broker is going to provide me with a written loss of value estimate this week. I'm leaning towards demanding that amount from the family in restitution, or I press charges for the theft of the vehicle. As far as I can tell, those are my two options to seek the full value of the investment. Just getting it repaired would mean taking a $250K+ loss when all is said and done.\n\nI know this would be a hardship, but my dad and step-fam won't exactly go hungry. They own a couple rental properties they could sell to come up with the cash. But in discussing this with my sister, she thinks I'm being unreasonable to burden the family with such a major expense and I should just let them pay to fix the car.\n\nI don't see how I can even remotely cover the loss I'm taking without pushing this ultimatum their way. WIBTA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: To clarify because I keep getting asked - the car was on my own property in my garage and was very well secured, but my dad had a key to the house that my step brother used to get in. He knew the alarm code and where the keys were hidden because, well, family.\n\nAlso, this probably wasn't too clear in the original post, but I'm not exactly wealthy or anything. At least not wealthy enough to afford my own supercar under normal circumstances. This was very much an investment towards retirement for me, hence why I almost never drive it.

You should be able to leave your property inside your garage with the expectation that it won\u2019t be stolen!", "NTA - I'd honestly have pressed charges already. He stole your car and caused massive damage, let alone the safety factor! He could have gotten himself and/or others severely injured or even killed operating a car he had no business being behind the wheel of, frankly he's lucky that was the worst that happened and their apologies don't cover all that. You're being generous giving them different options to work it out that don't include charges.\n\nAlso, what are they doing about him? Because if they haven't properly grounded him from literally everything, taken away his phone and any gaming devices, and told him he IS getting a job to help pay this back, it's not enough!", "I'm not sure what to advise at this point.  Your step-brother should not have stolen your car, no matter what it is.  So he's liable for that.  I would be pressing charges for it *and* suing for damages.  I don't know if a court will give you loss of value, but at least they should give you the cost of repairs at least.  But I'm no lawyer.  But I'm going with NTA.", "NTA-  press charges .\n\nThat little thief is old enough to know better . \n\nYour parents know that he\u2019s old enough to know better.\n\nThey will let this slide and you will never get your money back.\n\nPress charges. Only way to guarantee something is done about this.", "Just go to the police. You will never get the value from them.", " I\u2019d be putting it to them. Your father was in charge of the keys\u2026 it was up to him to secure it. Have the car valued now (with all original parts\u2026to prove they were there) pre accident and post accident! That will end the speculation. Do it twice or three times. Courts accept the opinion of experts all the time. See what they say. I would also see a lawyer. Don\u2019t threaten to have them charged, just put it to them to pay. Could be seen as blackmail otherwise.", "NTA\n\nHe decided to borrow the car for his prom, but he didn't ask you or get permission. How did he come into possession of the keys? How did your parents not see him leave with your car? How is this your problem that he stole your car?\n\nRemove the relationship from the equation and you would not be second guessing the right thing to do. Realistically based on the act, he would likely receive probation and have to pay restitution. Your parents would have to make you whole. Putting it through your insurance would be fraud. Pursuing the theft would shift the issue to the justice system and insurance company.\n\nSome decisions cost major dollars. If he would have killed someone or even himself, who would cover the bill? \n\nAs an investment, you may be able to recover the loss on taxes, but that will cost you too.", "NTA. It seems like the right course of action. Do they expect you to pay for someone else\u2019s wrong doing? Ludicrous.", "YWNBTA, but talk to a lawyer to find out about the legality of not filing a report concerning a serious accident, and about statutes of limitations.", "Nta\n\nI feel that people saying y t a are missing the fact (as it was only mentioned in comments) that OP's dad had the keys to the house. Stepbrother got them from him.\n\nTo me that increases the level of culpability for the parents.\n\nThey have parental responsibility and the thief got keys from them.", "NTA he should be held accountable for his actions. Although if the car is worth as much as you say, you should've done a far better job of protecting it as well. A 17-year-old shouldn't have that kind of easy access to a car worth that much if you really care about it.", "INFO - how did he gain access to the vehicle? Surely an investment property would be pretty much clamped and immobile?", "Oh for the love of god please tell me it's not a LP5000QV or a 25th \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA sue for the money and press charges.  He stole the car and tried to hide what he did.  You also need to report this as there may be damage to property, as in what did he hit to cause the damage. As it was your car they could come after you clamming you tried to \"Cover up\" what he did by not reporting it.", "NTA,\n\nMake the step-brother get a job and start paying it back. That should help him realize just how hard he's fucked up.", "NTA. It's not just a car, it's an investment. \n\nAsk your family this - if step-brother had burned down your investment rental property and they offered to replace it with a mobile home would it be a fair replacement? Because that's what they're saying.", "Just report him to police and be done with it. Stop beating around the bush", "**NTA**    \n\nYou should report it to the police.  The 17-year old will probably going to get a slap on the wrist and a sealed record.", "NTA.   Something needs to be done and your alarm codes and door locks changed too.    You can't trust them with your house ever again.    \n\nWhat are your area's rules on reporting accidents?   Could you later be held responsible yourself for failure to report?\n\nI don't think I'd easily stomach making them sell properties outright, but I'm probably too nice.  But if they weren't family that is the type of deal you might offer and be seen as more than fair to them.   You should not have to take a loss because of this.  Anything you didn't recoup would be a massive gift to them, although it sounds like they more take it for granted.  \n\nDo you think your dad was involved in stepbrother getting the keys?", "NTA, take it to your dad/step mum and say here are the options, as you presented them.\nDoes step bro have a college fund? Maybe it could partially pay for it, plus it would be direct consequences for his actions. He knew it was wrong and didnt own up hoping he wouldnt get caught. If he had come to you and told you the truth, apologised and offered to work out a payment plan to get it fixed (cause I assume he is unaware of how much it was valued at etc) I would be more inclined towards working with them. But he did the opposite basically, so, to me at least, actions have consequences.", "NTA\n\nBut maybe just present them with the paperwork showing lost of value and see what THEY come up with\n\nBut shouldn\u2019t THEIR insurance cover everything? Even if he had had permission?", "Oof. First off I understand the frustration. And am really sorry that such a beauty was damaged. But the question really is are you at a loss if you sold it even at the loss of value after repairs. Rn it sounds like you want the family to pay for the SPECULATION of full value. \n\nImo YBTA. Im betting you put ~$200k into the purchase. Even at a 50% loss of value off of $600k you\u2019re still up $100k. Forcing the family to sell property (in subprime markets) is ridiculous. And not to mention the fact that the car was available to be \u201cstolen\u201d is owner negligence. I think you have every right to be absolutely livid at your sibling AND your parents if there isnt some serious consequences. But you\u2019re threatening a record or severe financial burden on your family for at its worst angle, hampering your portfolio. Asking them to liquidate theirs or even threatening the legal consequences is a bridge too far imo. Your sibling is a kid. Lock up your toys Forsure in the future on top of your sibling should be worshiping the ground you walk on and spit shining that car until he goes to college or whatever. \n\nImo take the repair money. Make the sibling clean the car for like 2 years whenever you want as a form of repayment. Or something along those lines. Make it brutal manual labor if possible. And possibly see about insurance compensation.", "YTA I mean seriously there are other ways to do it besides holding your parents responsible when they didn't do anything, work it out with your step brother. Make him set up a payment plan. Eat the loss because apparently you didn't exactly have the thing locked up either, which you easily could have.", "YTA but not for the reason you think. Are you really threatening them with a grand larceny charge for the kid? You realize that you would be choosing to ruin your step-brother's life for a car, right?  \n\n\nAnd let's keep in mind that you left a supercar where a 17 yr old had access to it. That's pretty negligent if you ask me. Split the costs with them (repairs and lost value) and allow them to pay you in increments so they don't have to sell anything. Remember, it's the kid that is responsible and you'll likely get nothing if you press charges depending on where you live.", "You can't afford it? You said it tripled in value to over 600k, so if it loses 300k then it's still worth more than you bought it for.\n\nIf profit is worth more to you than your family, go ahead and charge him. Ruin his life for one (extremely stupid) mistake. If he's not taking responsibility, how will your dad paying for it help that situation? Have you even considered payment plans, or getting it revalued once fixed to see how much it's actually gone down in value?\n\nOne day you just might be lucky enough to be the richest person in the graveyard.

I have no idea why OP trusted the 17 yr old with access to anything of his, but the fact that he just leaves the key to a $600,000 supercar laying out, even in his own home, is just insane to me.

Especially in real estate and investment. The property is evaluated based on several SUBJECTIVE factors that are mostly market driven. \n\nRecent sales of similar builds in the neighborhood, square footage, age of construction, access to transportation, interest rates etc. \n\nIn depreciating assets such as vehicles it\u2019s even worse. The value of the car is based on what a private investor would be willing to pay. Not it\u2019s actual cost to replicate, or anything tangible. Perfect example. OP claims vehicle is worth $600k,  it he bought it at 1/3 of the price (estimated) there is no way to PROVE that value. It\u2019s speculative. Without a buyer coming in and saying I WAS going to buy it at X price. But then, the buyer would be happier taking the lower price themselves (as OP was in buyer friendly market conditions) \n\nAll of this is to say that OP is stretching the argument already claiming it was an \u201cinvestment\u201d vehicle in the first place. \n\nAbsolutely valid statement. But EXTREMELY speculative. \n\nOp is asking for more secure assets in exchange for a highly speculative asset. \n\nA better example would be \n\nImagine OP bought $200k of stocks. Random stock in one company. The markets in a bull run and that stock is then LATER valued at $600k. Then still later some CEO comes in and slashes the value of that to $400k. OP wants to sue for $200k. For irresponsible management of the company. OP would not be entitled to $200k of stock value. Even if OP won. He would be entitled to court fees and the CEO would suffer legal consequences, which may amount to a fine and jail time but the fine goes to the courts. And the court fees are paid to the courts and lawyers. Most likely initially by OPs gained stock value of $200k from his initial position. \n\nOP loses in all legal scenarios. Parents offered essentially the max financial coverage OP would ever expect to get. From legal relief, insurance, or even by out of pocket expenses for the repair of the asset. It\u2019s fucked.

Likely not, but he will get a fair chunk. And the step bro will have to delay his launch into adult life for a good few years, but he won't spend his entire life in debt and will have a financial future that isn't tied to paying off a huge sum that will frankly accrue interest much faster than he can pay it off. And maybe that will teach him to keep his hands of stuff that isn't his; if it isn't yours, you don't know the full ramifications of using it and what it could trigger behind the scenes. Sounds like a lot of people haven't learned that lesson as thoroughly as they think.\n\nAnd after all this, the op should look into secure storage for the car; not to prevent it happening again, but because the car was taken *to show off*.

Or agree to sign over one of their rental properties to you in their will, assuming that would be of value to you in retirement? \n\nAt the end of the day, though, I do think you have some asshole-y elements to look at here. First, any investment involves risk, and you need to own that risk. If a tree had fallen on your garage, or if you had crashed the car yourself, what would you have done? And, knowing that a 17 year old family member could easily access your house, knows the alarm code, etc, wouldn't it have made sense to keep the keys locked away somewhere? When you own something that valuable, it's your job to keep it safe and to have insurance coverage and backup plans that will kick in when needed. It sounds like the insurance you have isn't something you want to use here, and I get that, but I do think you have an element of responsibility in thinking that through before buying something like this. \n\nSecond, windfalls are windfalls and they aren't something you should get mad about when they don't play out as well as you'd have wanted. It sounds like you got a great price on this car, and that's probably in part because you had a connection with the previous owner, and in part because when the owner passed, their kids wanted to deal with things quickly and easily, and you offered a solution. Sure, you hoped to clean up on re-selling the car and putting money away, but if you can still come out ahead, it's not the best look to be mad you're not coming out as far ahead as you hoped. Am I right that with the $60k in repairs covered by your family, you could still sell this car, pay off the loan you used to buy it, and make a decent profit? Assuming so, I'd say the best solution would be to look for a middle ground everyone can agree on, because I really doubt any lawsuit is going to get you the full value.", "INFO Why do you have no intention of claiming it on your insurance, that makes literally no sense whatsoever?", "Info: I'm not clear on why you can't claim on the insurance - would this not cover your losses?", ">investment towards retirement\n\nIt's a car lmao.

They will tell you to swap insurance information and deal with it.\n\nYou need a police report for the unauthorized entry into your house and 'borrowing' of the vehicle.  Again, jurisdiction specific as to what charge that might fall under.  Burglary is a possibility.
