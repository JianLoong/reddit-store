She\u2019s treated me like an outcast and would often turn her kids against me and encourage them to insult me, disrespect me and treat me like dirt. My mom would always tell me to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d. So I would always forgive when they would apologize or act all nice again. \n\nDuring COVID lockdowns, my sister and her husband (not my nieces father) kicked her out because my sister was having her many mood swings, she has 4 other children and got them to participate in kicking out my niece. She called me and I quickly went to pick her up and I met her on the curb with trash bags and with my sister refusing to open the door. So I took her in my home where she stayed for 6 months and she even secured an apartment. Once my niece (20 at the time) got her apartment, my sister and her husband convinced her to move back in and my niece did and then the same niece turned on me and I felt very sad because she was in my home and I did everything for her when her own mom discarded her like trash. \n\nFast forward to 2021, she does the same thing with her (16M) son and he called me and again, I picked him up and let him stay. \nAt the time, my now husband and we\u2019re planning a wedding and of course regardless of our differences, there was no way I couldn\u2019t invite my sister and her kids. Also, It was in the height of COVID restrictions so we were very limited and the church only accepted close family. \n\nWhen I invited my sister, her and her kids ridiculed me. My sister even said that my attitude is too disgusting to get married, they\u2019re not coming because I don\u2019t deserve to get married, they even blocked me except my niece who promised she\u2019ll be there and promised to act as a witness. The day of, she didn\u2019t show up, no call no nothing. Thankfully, the photographer was nice enough to be a second witness for us. My mom called my niece asking why she did this. My niece said \u201cI don\u2019t even know what kind of wedding it is, I don\u2019t see the point in all this\u201d then hung up. I was broken and in tears. I know my sister put them up to it but I thought my niece would have risen above it given all I\u2019ve done for her when my sister (her mom) did what she did to her. \n\nI moved on but I vowed to never speak to them again. My husband and I are happily married and we have a new baby and we\u2019re thriving. \n\nNow my niece has met someone and she\u2019s getting married. My mom told me and told me to mark my calendar because we\u2019re going. I refused and reminded her of what they did on my wedding. My mom told me to stop living in the past and be the bigger person. I even cried to her and she gave me a blank stare then told me that no one thinks about her and that il regret my actions when she dies.

Your sister stops you from being happy due to being a disgusting human being toward you. Lose sister, gain happiness. \n\nWhat I will say though is that, if in the future her kids ever come to you with a sincere apology, please consider having them in your life. From what you said about your sister she seems to be an abusive manipulator and should have had her kids taken away from her a long time ago. Your niece going back to your sister is like a someone that keeps going back to an abusive partner because \"they promised to change\". It might take years or decades for them to understand the damage that was done to them and maybe they'll never even get it.\n\nBest of luck with your new little family!", "NTA\n\n\"Mom, I'm an adult and if I don't want to be around or have AHs in my life, I am allowed to cut them out.

But, as some other people pointed out if they treated you like this how will they treat your child? One of the things that finally made me go NC with my own mother was watching her start to treat my children the same way she treated me and my sisters. If you stay in contact with your mother, trust me cutting off family is not easy and often it sucks, if she brings up the wedding just say if I receive an invitation I\u2019ll let you know.  Never apologize for cutting toxic people out of your life.", "NTA, you're sister is the ah, and a massive one at that.

But why do you continue to allow your mom to bully you and slick abuse you?", "Geez. Your mom is as much as abusive as your sister? Why don't you cut her out of your life to focus on your family? Real family, not the abusive people. NTA, but consider what I said.", "NTA. I\u2019d be done with these people after all that bullshit. You don\u2019t need that.

At every turn, your mom has allowed your sister and her children to be absolutely horrible to you, and yet she\u2019s only shocked and appalled by you setting boundaries and protecting yourself. Cut off your sister, your mom, and (although this is a harder pill to swallow) your niblings. They sound like miserable people who derive joy from hurting you. NTA.", "NTA. \u201cBigger person\u201d = doormat. Don\u2019t go.", "NTA", "NTA. There\u2019s a similar dynamic in my family, among my sisters. We were raised hyper religious. Our eldest sister has a daughter, \u201cHappy\u201d who is a demonic spawn of satan (sarcasm) she has pulled some seriously unforgivable shit. According to our faith, and my sister\u2019s goofy interpretations of it, that meant putting up with it over and over again. \n\nI went NC with the niece, and my eldest sister. My next sister was trying to mediate and tell me I had to forgive \u201cHappy\u201d because the Lord says our salvation depends on it. I said fine, I forgive her. There\u2019s obviously something wrong with her - borderline personality, something. She\u2019s dangerous. She\u2019s destructive. I wish her her well. But I\u2019m not putting my self in her path ever again. That\u2019s just stupid. That\u2019s like standing on a freeway and forgiving the car that smashes you. You get out of the hospital and take your scarred broken self back to the freeway and get smashed again? Forgive the car again? \nHow many times?

I would send a message that when she throws out the next teenager you will call CPS instead and get them to your home, I would go LC with your mom to, she can pretend she only have one daughter and leave at that.", "NTA at all. But you need to stop making yourself small to be the bigger person. No mother should ask their own child to endure and excuse what you have dealt with. Teach your child to stand up for themselves by setting the example beginning here.", "What I hate more than AHs are their enablers. \n\nAs I was reading the story, I was like this Mom has to be actually emotionless this entire time to be blind to the years of verbal abuse. The more likely possibility is that she clearly has a favourite child and it is definitely not OP. Go at least LC with sis and family and NC with the mother....", "agree with you", "Ikr, like what does that even mean?", "Being the bigger person often = Being the flatter doormat.\n\nNTA OP. Cut them off and leave them cut off.", "I would say I'm going. Then not show up", "Your mom is the biggest a hole because she allowed her much older daughter to bully you and abuse you. It\u2019s almost always a red flag to tell the abuse victim to \u201cbe the bigger person.\u201d It\u2019s like code for continuing to accept the abuse because your mother didn\u2019t want to be the \u201cbad guy.\u201d She was happy to let her minor daughter be a punching bag to her much older sibling.", "lmfao look at your mom with that manipulation. don't play her games, ok? we know who your sister resembles now.", "Options:  \n\\- Tell them to eff off and cut contact.

She stared blankly at you after you vented to her and then said that nobody thinks of her? Sounds like some narcissistic behavior.\n\nPut your foot down OP, do not budge on this. If you do attend I bet you are ridiculed and made a fool of at the wedding by your \u201csister\u201d and her offspring, only to be told by your mother that you are over reacting when you get upset and to be the bigger person. \n\nUgh I am frustrated for you OP.

I'm very low contact with my sister(only holidays/big gatherings). My dad died 2 years ago and he would always tell me the same thing. He wasn't a good dad(narcissistic) anyway, but the only thing I felt is relief.

Stand your ground, OP - you're not being cocky, you're showing self-respect. And don't send a gift, either! Six months of hosting your niece was enough.", "I wish you a happy and a long life without all this mess <3 all the best", "Yeah, sounds like your mom is pushing and lying from both ends. If no official invite comes, then you were not invited. If one comes just rsvp no. \n\nBTW how did it go with 16M?", "Oh, wow\u2026this is even worse. Your mom is pressuring you to go when she knows you likely aren\u2019t invited. And then your sister and her family will be outraged that you crashed the wedding and bully you more. Avoid this whole situation. Your mom sucks.", "It\u2019s incredibly tough on moms to have children who don\u2019t get along, even when one person is the reason.

OP, NTA", "No that would mean going down to their level. NTA op but keep the stance you already have and go low contact with your mother.

Don\u2019t minimise what this terrible mother is doing by calling it \u201cpeacemaking\u201d. She\u2019s not trying to make peace, she\u2019s trying to fake it and save face in front of the other wedding guests and expecting OP to quietly accept abuse to make her mothers life easier.", "I don't think this is the case here, but I do understand where you're coming from.  My dad always tried to play buffer between my younger brother & sister and me.  We were full siblings but did not always grow up in the same house. My siblings chose to make assumptions about me and my life despite often going years at a time without seeing me.  My dad often tried to third-party \"mediate\" the conflict with a \"nobody's at fault\" attitude.  It was honestly infuriating as the only person who wanted us to all be buddy-buddy was him."]}
