She\u2019s 15 years older than me so maybe we didn\u2019t have much of a connection and she\u2019s always been resentful towards me. She\u2019s treated me like an outcast and would often turn her kids against me and encourage them to insult me, disrespect me and treat me like dirt. My mom would always tell me to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d. So I would always forgive when they would apologize or act all nice again. \n\nDuring COVID lockdowns, my sister and her husband (not my nieces father) kicked her out because my sister was having her many mood swings, she has 4 other children and got them to participate in kicking out my niece. She called me and I quickly went to pick her up and I met her on the curb with trash bags and with my sister refusing to open the door. So I took her in my home where she stayed for 6 months and she even secured an apartment. Once my niece (20 at the time) got her apartment, my sister and her husband convinced her to move back in and my niece did and then the same niece turned on me and I felt very sad because she was in my home and I did everything for her when her own mom discarded her like trash. \n\nFast forward to 2021, she does the same thing with her (16M) son and he called me and again, I picked him up and let him stay. \nAt the time, my now husband and we\u2019re planning a wedding and of course regardless of our differences, there was no way I couldn\u2019t invite my sister and her kids. Also, It was in the height of COVID restrictions so we were very limited and the church only accepted close family. \n\nWhen I invited my sister, her and her kids ridiculed me. My sister even said that my attitude is too disgusting to get married, they\u2019re not coming because I don\u2019t deserve to get married, they even blocked me except my niece who promised she\u2019ll be there and promised to act as a witness. The day of, she didn\u2019t show up, no call no nothing. Thankfully, the photographer was nice enough to be a second witness for us. My mom called my niece asking why she did this. My niece said \u201cI don\u2019t even know what kind of wedding it is, I don\u2019t see the point in all this\u201d then hung up. I was broken and in tears. I know my sister put them up to it but I thought my niece would have risen above it given all I\u2019ve done for her when my sister (her mom) did what she did to her. \n\nI moved on but I vowed to never speak to them again. My husband and I are happily married and we have a new baby and we\u2019re thriving. \n\nNow my niece has met someone and she\u2019s getting married. My mom told me and told me to mark my calendar because we\u2019re going. I refused and reminded her of what they did on my wedding. My mom told me to stop living in the past and be the bigger person. I even cried to her and she gave me a blank stare then told me that no one thinks about her and that il regret my actions when she dies. She says I\u2019m being incredibly selfish and bitter and she\u2019s shocked that I\u2019m not over it.

There\u2019s many more labels for her but I\u2019ll digress.  About 7 years ago, I found out from a good friend, who called to tell me to watch my back with my sister and her husband.  She informed me that my BIL, who worked at Publix in the pharmacy as a second job (he\u2019s a firefighter/paramedic) was looking up my medications, relaying them to her, and she was calling the family and friends to tell them I had a problem and was an addict.  This was 3 months before my 4th major back surgery, and I couldn\u2019t walk, sit or sleep due to the incredible pain.  Yes, I was on pain meds, to help me hang on until the surgery.\n\nTo say I was livid was putting it mildly.  I called multiple family and friends who verified that yes, she was relaying this info to them and telling them I was an addict.\n\nI never confronted her because she\u2019s a mean, vindictive, narcissist.  What I did do was report this to the police, call Publix and report this, and had many conversations with their attorney.  They were pissed and denied everything, no worries I had a bunch of witnesses.  After my 4th surgery she showed up at the hospital and acted like nothing was wrong.  While she was there, my neurosurgeon walked in to check on me, (he was going to release me that day, day 5 after).  He asked me how I was feeling and I told him I didn\u2019t feel so good and I felt like a had a fever.  He told me that I wasn\u2019t going home, after it was confirmed, that I did indeed have a fever, all while my sister was there.\n\nMy sister then went and told everyone that I was going through withdrawls in the hospital and they kept me.  This is hard to do when you are on pain meds every 4 hours.  This is just what she does. 4-1/2 weeks after the surgery, 3-1/2 weeks after being home, my 6 inch incision ruptured open.  I was taken immediately to the hospital by my son and was in for another 8 days, daily packing\u2019s and another surgery.  It was brutal.  It wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault, just a pocket of fluid that built up and ruptured the incision.  I went home, still in my hard plastic back brace with two drains and multiple sutures.  The drains were in for 3 weeks and the sutures for a month.  To say I was a mental basket case would be an understatement.  It took about 2 years before I had calmed myself down enough about this happening again.  The scar site was really tight, especially on hot days.  A mental fucking is what it was.\n\nAnyhow, she went after me relentlessly and I wouldn\u2019t respond which passed her off, so she involved everyone she could, including my 12 year old niece, who then started texting me asking me why I was destroying our family. WTF? This went on for 3 years.  She went after my dad relentlessly also, and just berated him, calling him every name in the book and much more.  My dad and step mom knew what was really going on because they were with me every step of the way, including going into every dr\u2019s visit I had when my husband couldn\u2019t take me.\n\nMy mother on the other hand did my sisters bidding because she refuses to go against her, even when she\u2019s dead wrong.  She s terrified of her wrath.  My mother and I had many heated conversations about her involvement and talking about me behind my back to my sister, even when she said she wouldn\u2019t discuss me with her at all anymore.  Well she lied, and continued to do so, and I confronted her each time.  In 2017 we went to Ireland with my mom and step dad and had an amazing time, thinking I could trust her.  On July 1st, 2018, I called my mom to wish them a happy anniversary and had a great conversation, ending with her telling me she would talk to me before we went to the Bahamas at the end of the month.  Well that didn\u2019t happen, and it was fine, we were super busy getting ready for our trip.  Since July 1st, 2018 my mother has cut me off and out of her life.  Other than knowing it\u2019s because of my sister, I have NO idea what happened.  She didn\u2019t respond to texts, emails or letters.\n\nAnyhow, as you can tell it\u2019s a long lengthy saga which includes so so so much more.  It includes my daughter who also got in with my sister and cut me off January 2017, for no reason.  Well to her she had all kinds of reasons.
