We've always been friendly with her, because she is the daughter of a family friend. Her social media posts were mainly about her travels, evenings out, etc. Mine are generally about my fitness hobbies, but sometimes I post excerpts from non-fiction books I've been reading. Typically I only ever commented on her posts to make positive affirmations about whatever she's posting. \"Looks like fun!\" that sort of thing.\n\nBy contrast, this acquaintance of ours decided to start sending me direct messages aggressively arguing about politics. I don't really like to do this on social media. I would respond politely, usually doing my best to express sympathy for her views, assert the mildest possible disagreement when we did disagree, and try to bring such conversations to a civil or friendly conclusion as quickly as possible.\n\nHer DMs gradually got more aggressive, and eventually, after insulting me many times and carrying on arguments long after they became unproductive, even as I tried to wrap them up nicely, she unfriended me - but not my wife.\n\nOf course, throughout this time, I would share these DMs with my wife, and my wife would express shock and disapproval at our acquaintance's insults toward me. So my wife and I seemed to be on the same page.\n\nWe did cross paths with the acquaintance once after all this social media drama, at a mutual friend's party. Our acquaintance very deliberately ignored and avoided me. For my part, I had a long (an hour or so) and friendly conversation (unrelated to any of the above) with her husband, and left it at that.\n\nA year later, my wife was invited to the acquaintance's baby shower, and my wife has decided to go. I told her that this felt a little disloyal to me, considering that this woman repeatedly insulted me and finally \"unfriended\" me, and my wife saw all of these insults, etc. \n\nIt seems wrong to me for my wife to carry on a friendly relationship with a person who insults her husband and pointedly refuses to interact with me on any level. My position is, if the tables were turned and one of my friends insulted my wife, that person wouldn't be my friend anymore, regardless of how they treated me. \"You mess with the bean, you mess with the whole burrito,\" so to speak. I don't understand why my wife feels differently, and it feels really disloyal to me.\n\nSo, I asked her not to go to the shower. My wife isn't angry with me, but she is committed to attending the baby shower, no matter what I say. She says that when someone has a baby, you're supposed to wish them well, and that's that.\n\nWhat do you think?

If I post something I won't argue about I make that clear as well, but people are free to comment what they will..... I even post helpful community information and have gotten comments back of thanks..... So, what was your actually point of posting these social experiments? Why did you want to share them?

I think you're right, and I'll do that.", "To be fully transparent, I suspect that if she were a rabid conservative, you\u2019d have said that in the post. But I have also read enough about the psychology of human happiness to  know that some of the research can hard to swallow to entirely apolitical reasons. So I believe you, despite the evasiveness. \n\nAs an aside, I found that my own social media acquaintances stopped arguing with me on social media posts when I refused to argue. I\u2019d send a list of articles / books that I was basing my opinion on, and offer to read whatever they\u2019d send me to explain their take on it. Might work well for you too since you said the stuff you post is data-driven!", "I just wonder if she felt that the way the posts were worded invited DMs or thought that some of the content required correction or debate? Either way, this was between you and her and not between her and your wife. You don\u2019t have to like the woman and you don\u2019t have to like your wife\u2019s relationship with her so you are not TA for not wanting her to attend the baby shower. I do suspect that the context of the DMs will make you look like TA, which is why you are not sharing that but that is your prerogative and is not the question you asked, so I\u2019m going with NTA/not enough in.", "Tell me what \u201cfact\u201d I got wrong", "No problem! I hope it goes well", "Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for sharing your perspective and for going back and forth a bit on it to arrive at a verdict.

What I said was that it hurts that she didn't stand up for me and still wants to go to this other woman's baby shower. That's an opinion of mine, you're welcome to disagree, but at no point did I say anything about what my wife \"needs to\" do.\n\nMy wife agrees with what I posted. She told me so. She does not think I am or \"was being\" an asshole in what I posted. As mentioned in a separate comment, many of the book excerpts I posted were from books my wife agrees with and recommended to me.\n\nI am not here to argue. I am here to solicit feedback on the question about the baby shower. I will register that your feedback is 1) that you suspect I am a misogynist and 2) that my social media posts are terrible and 3) that my wife thinks I'm an asshole, and that 4) thus I am the asshole in this scenario. \n\nOnly 4) is relevant for me here. You happen to be wrong about the other three, but I won't argue about it. You think what you think, that's okay. You're operating on the limited information you have, and I expect there to be a full range of opinions on this. Thank you for your opinion and for challenging me on things in an effort to seek the truth.", "Thankyou.", "First - you said \u201cafter carrying on arguments until they become unproductive I tried to wrap things up\u201d \n\nThird - you infer \u201cyour woman / wife\u201d should have your back and not attend a baby shower. It\u2019s the premise of the entire post.   \n\nFourth - your entire post is saying she should have your back\n\nWt\u2026.\n\nTurning off replies."]}
