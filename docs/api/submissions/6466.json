Teachers always forgot I was in class even if they talked me to so got in trouble for skipping class when I didn't a few times too. I hope that somehow they can realize you're 17, and that you are communicating where you are and such, and that it's okay to let you do things and go out sometimes, and to just teach you to be safe and mindful instead of teaching you not to want to listen to their excessive overprotectiveness. Again honestly impressive way to handle it and also really funny, all the best to you and I hope your parents start giving you the same freedoms as your brothers.", "Info: how old are you? If you told them the day before sleeping over at a friend's house they may have forgotten, why didn't you text them to remind them? Why didn't you answer texts or calls? I think you know YTA, but they may be a bit of an AH as well, depending on how old you are and what \"controlling you\" looks like. If you're 13 and didn't come home, they'd be right to worry and try to get ahold of you. If you're 25 less so.

I do understand parents can worry about a child just disappearing on them though.

This is part of growing up. You check in with your parents when they want to know that you\u2019re ok. You\u2019re becoming more independent but that also comes with social responsibilities.

Keep up the good work.", "As a parent, I\u2019d like to take a look at two things.\n\nOne, while I can secretly understand being a little more scared for a girl child then a boy, you have to shelve that and treat everyone equally. Or at least reasonably equally. You can\u2019t blatantly allow the boys to do whatever they want and then act like the daughters need to be locked up in the castle.\n\nTwo, you say you woke up to a bunch of missed calls and messages? Why did you miss them? I\u2019d be okay if my teenager went to a sleep over, but I\u2019m going to check in by the end of the night just to make sure everything is okay, and I would expect my child to answer within at least a few hours.

She didn\u2019t say she \u2018woke up to\u2019 all these missed calls. She said \u2018they know i sleep with it on silent\u2019.
