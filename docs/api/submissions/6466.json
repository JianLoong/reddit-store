Always gets the point across to those who refuse to listen", "Depends on whether they remembered you were sleeping out, whether you ghosted them on the phone and they spent a night concerned about your whereabouts. Also depends on how old you are. Judging by the MC, I\u2019d say 16ish?\n\nSo INFO", "NTA, and honestly better way to handle it than lashing out or starting fights. I'd say you're being pretty reasonable, I used to have similar issues where I'd tell mum where I was / how long I'd be, she would forget so when I got home I'd be in trouble. Teachers always forgot I was in class even if they talked me to so got in trouble for skipping class when I didn't a few times too. I hope that somehow they can realize you're 17, and that you are communicating where you are and such, and that it's okay to let you do things and go out sometimes, and to just teach you to be safe and mindful instead of teaching you not to want to listen to their excessive overprotectiveness. Again honestly impressive way to handle it and also really funny, all the best to you and I hope your parents start giving you the same freedoms as your brothers.", "Info: how old are you? If you told them the day before sleeping over at a friend's house they may have forgotten, why didn't you text them to remind them? Why didn't you answer texts or calls? I think you know YTA, but they may be a bit of an AH as well, depending on how old you are and what \"controlling you\" looks like. If you're 13 and didn't come home, they'd be right to worry and try to get ahold of you. If you're 25 less so. Also is it controlling to want to check in with you when you're not in the house or are they coming from a place of care?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Obnoxious, yes, but I don\u2019t think it rises to AH. \n\nCongratulations on your small victory. I hope it lasts!", "INFO How old are you and your brothers?", "NTA\n\nThey asked.

I told them during breakfast and called them again to tell them I was going to my friend's place. My phone was on silent, it's always like that when I go to sleep and they know it.

The real AH are the parents for being a person even have to do that in the first place.", "I'm going to say ESH. \n\nIf you told them you were staying over then they they are an asshole for being so upset about it. I do understand parents can worry about a child just disappearing on them though. It would cause a panic. \n\nYou are kind of an asshole for taking it so far with saying everything you do, but since they were assholes to begin with your assholery was justified. \n\nThis should have been something reasonable people could have just sat down and talked out a solution.", "He definitely has that.

Did they only call while you were sleeping?**\n\nYou could have your phone in DND and if they called multiple times, it can ring through. \n\nIf you were my kid and ignored my calls over hours, I would be livid with you. This is part of growing up. You check in with your parents when they want to know that you\u2019re ok. You\u2019re becoming more independent but that also comes with social responsibilities. And your failure to recognize that, along with your MC, says to me that you don\u2019t even understand the hell they probably went through, not knowing where you were.\n\nIf you were my kid, I would have called the police.", "There were about 13 missed calls from both sides.
