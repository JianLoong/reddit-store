I wish someone would have for me. \nI know it will be hard, I'm sure you're scared of basically becoming a parent overnight, but you can do this. You'll be each others support, and you will watch him flourish in a way that's refreshing. He deserves better than we ever got. Every child does, and I'm glad he has someone like you looking out for him for his wellbeing. \nTake him, leave, and never talk to those people again. You do not need them, and they certainly do not deserve either of you.", "I'm at least relieved that it doesn't seem like our mother sexually assaulted him, because there's a non 0 chance he's actually my kid.. so yeah it's all just fucked", "Yeah, I only known parts of what happened, I'll get him on some therapy soon, probably online so he can feel comfortable talking in our mother language.", "Knowing our mother, ate least half would be alcohol...

You're rescuing your brother from a toxic and abusive life and giving him a life full of love.

It takes time, and even the best parents / role models make mistakes from time to time.   You got this man and your brother is lucky to have you!", "You're going to be a great one. I'm sure that your brother already looks up to you as his hero since you're rescuing him from their abuse and giving him a chance at a decent life. You're obviously a good human being, or you wouldn't have done that. Keep being a good human being, and remember to *explain* what you want him to do and why, when you make rules. Most kids that age are surprisingly reasonable if they understand the point behind the request!! \n\nFinally, the one piece of parenting advice I ever found useful: raise the child you have, not the child you thought you were going to have. If your brother changes -- anything from life goals to gender identity -- then roll with it and work with the person he is then, no matter what you had expected he'd be like up until a week ago. You have to meet kids where they are in live... demanding that they DO something can be valid if the behavior is important, but demanding that they BE something will never get you anywhere. \n\nYou're young for it, but you have your life together and your brother already adores you. Keep talking to each other. You two will do just fine together.", "I went to a memorial service for a former student, who I was close to. She was only 19.

Apparently, his dad's family had been abusing kids, both male and female, like that for GENERATIONS and just swept it all under the rug. My stepdaughters went scorched earth and blew the \"rugs\" to heck and gone. Now, everyone in their hometown \\*KNOWS\\*. He was incarcerated for life, nearly got the death penalty because the Military deems crimes like that as an execution offense. The worst part about it all was that his paternal grandfather was a COP and several family members were mandated reporters.)\n\nOMG. OP, I hope that you will consider therapy, if not for yourself, definitely for your brother!", "NTA. Sounds like you (hopefully) got him out just in time before your mum started to SA him too. \n\nThere\u2019s a chance she started early though and clearly there was emotional abuse going on so I\u2019d get your brother into therapy ASAP. Even if his relationship with your parents had been fine I\u2019d still recommend it because of this being such a big change in his life. \n\nFantastic job OP. You\u2019re being the adult you needed when you were his age and you should be very proud of yourself. \n\nYour dad is an AH but there\u2019s also a chance he reached out because he couldn\u2019t protect your brother from your mum now that he\u2019s sick. I know that\u2019s probably giving him more credit than is due but it\u2019s always a possibility. \n\nProud of you x", "NTA. You end your post saying everyone thinks your an AH.

I was always so busy studying and working full-time while also doing my house chores and all that shit since I was 18 living by myself that I just realized now that I finally am well enough and have free time to do therapy, so I'll try to find myself some ASAP", "As someone who has been through boatloads of therapy, I think your level of self-awareness is a good sign. Also, remember that you don\u2019t have to be perfect for your brother. Honesty and effort are more important than trying to never make a mistake. Include him in your decisions and feelings in an age appropriate way. Apologize when you make a mistake and don\u2019t secretly torment yourself about it. Continue imitating things you saw good parents do, like your friend\u2019s dad. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help - from your future therapist, from your brother\u2019s teachers and coaches, and even your brother. Remember that you don\u2019t have to *follow* all the advice you receive. You don\u2019t have to be his \u201cparent\u201d to fulfill this parental role.

I know it's really easy to sweep any mental health issues when juggling life and now caring for your brother, but trust me when I say finding the right therapist who'll listen and help you, will make a world of difference. And don't rush in finding a therapist, take your time to find the right therapist. And if you get overwhelmed with life again, reach out to a friend if you don't have a therapist. Cause how can you take care of your brother if you aren't taking care of yourself?", "I'll have to look into that when we get home, but thanks for the heads up, worst case scenario I'll find him a local therapist that can do sessions in English since he's pretty good at it.", "I'm looking into getting him therapy asap, as for myself I never really did it, I just realized that for the first time in a long time I actually have some spare time I could use so I might get some for myself as well, thanks.", "OH I am so sorry. I am glad you got out and are getting your brother out. This is terrible on so many levels.", "I suggest this because becoming his guardian may bring up some issues you need to unpack.\n\nPlus a therapist can help direct you to resources on how to effectively guide him through his own trauma responses.\n\nAs happy as he is to join you in Bulgaria, he's going to have moments of feeling isolated, worry about his family(even if he \"hates\" them).  Chats via facetime or whatever with family(even supervised) may bring up emotions too big for him to deal with.  You are going to need the tools to both recognize and help him resolve those emotions.\n\nYou have a big job ahead of you but I think these Redditors believe in you.\n\nPS you'll make mistakes, we all do.  Let him know when you have done so.  And be willing to apologize.  These are HUGE lessons kids learn by example.", "NTA. You just saved his life", "NTA", "NTA.
