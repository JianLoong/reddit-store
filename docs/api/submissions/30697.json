That is true of birthday parties too. Sometimes unavoidable obligations keep us away. You're allowed to choose to risk that later you'll regret not attending this one.\n\nIn this case your father is a complicated kind of stranger and it sounds like you're being pushed to go not to support someone (your mother for example) but because people want you to be hurt enough that you need support, and you don't think you are.\n\nOne nice thing about funerals is that they are generally designed to share windows into the deceased's life. You'll probably learn more about your father at his funeral than you ever knew before. If you went, you'd also meet your half-siblings and (if you wanted to) other people who could help you understand your father a bit better. But it's okay if you don't want that, it just comes with the possibility that you'll regret it later.\n\nIf you went, you would grieve. Even if that grief was for the relationship you wanted with him once. You may also find the same works by watching a tear jerker movie with a dad who dies. But you should cry a little bit even if you don't want to, because it means you can cry a lot if you find you need to, and sometimes we aren't honest with ourselves any how we feel when those feelings are complicated.

It got her you. Be there to support her as she reflects on their relationship over the years.\n\nConsider going for yourself. Granted, you didn't have a relationship with your biological father and you might not have or want one with his relatives. But attending the funeral may give you the opportunity to grieve what you didn't have. I attended my biological father's funeral who I had only met a few times. I went because my biological mother told me she was going. I didn't think it would be a big deal, just thought I would learn a little more about him from what was shared, knowing that it was likely the rose-colored version of him. Funny thing is I don't remember what others said as I was too busy wiping tears off my face.\n\nIt wasn't that I was going to miss him as a part of my life, because he wasn't a part of it. It was more about grieving over the loss of possibilities, of what our relationship might or could have been that I didn't realize I subconsciously carried with me. It helped me let go of something that I didn't realize I was carrying around. It was a few years later that I realized these subconscious expectations had also impacted my relationships with others. I didn't realize I had let my lack of relationship with my biological father become a barrier with others. Probably wouldn't have figured it out if I hadn't attended the funeral.\n\nSo, don't attend to grieve the loss of your biological father's life. If you attend, go to honor your mom.

Sure, it sucks that he may have treated them better than he did you - and honestly, he did provide for you and sent you Christmas and birthday gifts.    No, gifts don\u2019t make up for contact/conversations, but it at least shows that he tried.  Again, why was there little contact?   Be that as it may, do what you think is right for you.

From your post, I gather she\u2019s incredibly upset and not thinking rationally. She pulled the military card (and I say this as a partner of someone in the military) when she shouldn\u2019t have (I hate when people do that), but she\u2019s probably grasping at straws for reasons to beg you to go with her. \n\nTalk to her. Seriously and honestly. Find out her real motivations for wanting you to go if you can. She may just truly want your presence as support. Remember, if she goes alone, she\u2019ll be seeing and dealing with people who know the whole sordid story. That has to be overwhelming. It\u2019ll still be overwhelming if you go with her (for both of you), but you\u2019ll have each other to lean on. \n\nAgain, if you feel strongly that you do not want to be there, don\u2019t go. You\u2019re well within your rights not to. I just think an honest, rational discussion with your mom might shed some more light on her true reasons for wanting you there.

Of course it would involve travelling to another country so I wouldn\u2019t want to do that anyway, but also because I don\u2019t know the man and he made no effort to know me or even help my mum by actually doing the bare minimum of paying child support, despite being taken to court over it more than once.

Before she did that, however, he remarried and had kids. I sometimes wonder if my half siblings realize they're born out of wedlock? Because he was a bigamist, but that's a conversation for another time. Regardless, I didn't go to his funeral, heck I didn't even know he died until several years afterward and that was only because I was having my genealogy done. Guess what? I don't regret not going to his funeral, I don't regret not knowing him, I don't regret not knowing that additional family. Because he was simply nothing in my life. You won't regret it either.", "You are NTA. Never YTA for skipping a funeral, people feel how they feel and grieve how they grieve. You feel like you can't grieve cause you didn't respect him, cause you didn't even know him. But you don't need a reason.

I doubt his \"father\" even knew what presents the OP was getting, if his wife was making the call to find out what the OP wanted and 100% was the one actually buying them and send them. \nI am shocked though with the paternal grandparents for making no effort to at least try to be in their grandchild's life somehow.\nOP maybe should send a condolences card to the widow...NTA", "Yea\u2026kinda goes hand in hand, I don\u2019t remember respecting him because I don\u2019t KNOW him.", "The other only other thing I can think of is if he has anything approaching any kind of affection at all for his stepmom (not necessarily love, because it sounds like he barely knows her any better than his dad; just if he has any feelings for her warmer than \u201cshe\u2019s a home wrecker who ruined my childhood\u201d) then he might have a convo with *her* to figure out what *she* wants. Hers are definitely not the only feelings to be considered (not by a long shot) but the fact remains that despite the questionable choices she and OP\u2019s dad made in getting together, they did share a life for the past umpteen years and that possibly means something slightly above \u201cnot giving a fuck\u201d about what she might think. \n\nShe may appreciate OP\u2019s support and may want to surround herself with things and people related to her late husband. But she could have also really resented playing the middleman in the relationship between an ineffectual, shitty man and his understandably hurt son. Or, she could have even just resented the fact that OP exists at all, but smiled and played nice because that\u2019s what she felt she ought to do.\n\nFunerals are for the living. OP doesn\u2019t give a damn, he has no skin in the game in terms of going to this one. But, if he wants to, he could be a support for someone who *does* give a damn. Of course, he is not obligated to do so, either. \n\nTL;DR: If I had to break it down it would look a little bit like this:\n- stepmom would not appreciate OP\u2019s presence: no question, don\u2019t go. OP\u2019s mom can pound sand.\n- stepmom would appreciate OP\u2019s presence: does OP give a shit at all about her? If no, don\u2019t go. If yes, figure out whether he\u2019s in a headspace where he can go to offer his support while still taking care of himself. If he doesn\u2019t think he can, then he shouldn\u2019t go. If he does think he can, he should consider maybe going.\n\nAnd for anyone worried that OP is going to eventually regret not paying his respects to his father, the great news about that is the dude\u2019s already dead, and respects can be paid at any time, from anywhere, in whatever way feels appropriate to the person paying them, to the person they are truly meant for.

Don't go.", "NTA. \n\nBut if you dont want to go, don't. \n\nOP doesnt have to do things so others \"don't feel bad\" - thats BS. Mom didn't do anything wrong and shouldn't feel bad that her son doesn't want to go to his absent dads funeral, she should be more understanding that this dude played 0 part in his life so there's nothing to grieve. \n\nAs you said, funerals are for the living. OP shouldn't have to go and deal with a bunch of sad blood relations he will likely never know and hear how great of a dad his dad likely was to his other kids, but couldn't afford the same to OP.", "OP should not go just to make sure mom doesn't feel bad.

To me it just sounds like everything was just too much for the father, not that he was an uncaring asshole.

Your mom, because she'll have to face people from a life she once had, who turned their backs on her.\n\nYou don't have to consider them family. You don't have to play along with the charade, you can just nod and be taciturn. You can even tell people that you're there to keep  your mother company. But just you going with her would mean a lot to your mom.\n\nBut if you do go -- be honest with her. 'Mom, I don't consider those people family. I'm not going to play happy families and reunite with relative, or to mourn a man I never met. I'm going because you want to go, and I don't want you to go alone. That's it.'\n\nSometimes, for the people we love, we put our own feelings aside.  For you, going is pointless -- for your mom, it's a big deal.  If you don't go, I'm sure your mother will work through her feelings and deal with things. If you do go, I think your relationship will be stronger than ever.\n\nAs an adult, if I was in your position now, I would go for those reasons.  I wouldn't care about the funeral -- I'd go so my mom wouldn't be alone in that sea of 'relatives', I'd just be going for her. But I think it would still  hurt, and it would still bring up lots of complicated, difficult feelings.\n\nAnd you're still young and growing and learning how to deal with normal feelings, never mind complicated ones.  So it's okay if you decide that you can't go after all; I strongly feel that you *should* go, but I honestly would not judge you if you didn't (if you were my age, I'd be judging!  But you're still 17).\n\nFor now though, maybe rephrase it as you think about it.  The important question is not 'Should I go to my father's funeral as his son?' but 'Am I able to escort my mother to my father's funeral as *her* son?' Weigh it up, talk to her -- ask her why she wants to go, if you can (she might not be able to give a straight answer, sometimes you just need closure).
