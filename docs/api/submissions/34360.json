I\u2019ve worked in public service for 12 years (and in private 10 years before that) and directly with Fire Departments. If an engineer, or streets crew, or parks guy, or admin staff sat around waiting to get a call about something, it would be all over social media with complaints about overpaid, lazy public employees. If your point is that the nature of their job (that they respond to emergencies) affords them to wait for a call and watch movies, I guess the argument ends there. Note that there are lots of other emergencies that are responded to outside of fire. There is ALWAYS work to be done when on the clock. If HBO is how a 15 minute break is spent, or lunch, I get it. Just seems like, in my opinion (if those are still allowed), NFL Sunday Ticket and HBO are crossing a line.", "Her account she had first that he chipped in on after they were together. Then he broke like the one rule of her sharing the account.", "How... How will her identity get stolen? By clicking open on the app??? Please do tell.", "A friend\u2019s child did this exact thing at their frat house. One of the frat brothers managed to change the password and email, then  lock my friend out. It took ages to get the account back under his control. He still had to pay for it. \n\nAlso, if it\u2019s a password she uses for other accounts, as many people do, that\u2019s a risk to those accounts. \n\nI don\u2019t know about OP\u2019s husband\u2019s coworkers, but I\u2019ve know a few cops and firefighters in my time who were drawn to the profession bc the were narcissistic and selfish. If OP runs into one of those dudes, no telling what they\u2019d do with her Netflix info. \n\nOh, and you absolutely can hack that password from the device even if it appears to be anonymized. My husband is a CIO at a fortune 50. I used to be in IT. \n\nPasswords like this are absolutely unsecure by their nature. When they are shared, they are even less so. \n\nWhen we have people to our house, mini asked to get into our Wi-Fi. We never do it you you know who never asks to get to our Wi-Fi? People who work in IT and understand how security works.", "A friend\u2019s child did this exact thing at their frat house.

Please shove your opinions into the deepest recesses of your asshole.", "You're comparing jobs that have nothing in common with responders to emergencies, it was obvious I was referring those types of jobs. \n\nI also already stated before that yes fire fighters respond to all types of calls not just fire related but many other type of emergencies, ones that if not risking their life they are usually seeing things that can't be unseen. \n\nOf course anyone working a job like those deserve to clear their mind with some tv between calls, even if it's only a 15 minute break between them. \n\nNone of it crosses a line, what does it matter what they can watch when they get the chance? They still have to rush off when calls come in no matter what's on TV, it's not like they wait because the game is on. \n\nI mean sure they have days where they get lucky and may not have anything scarring or life threatening to do but the fact they take the jobs that do infact have those things, should allow them to watch TV if waiting for a call.", "Can access the account information from the app and it\u2019s her name and email. Gosh, y\u2019all need to learn to protect yourselves better from identity theft.", "Considering how much you know about all this, wouldn\u2019t you think the first step and most obvious step be to make a unique password (like you should for every service) so it\u2019s only for Netflix and a non-issue?"]}
