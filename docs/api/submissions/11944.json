I believe they began on tiktok as for the past few months, tiktoks about the 'elites' controlling the world were being posted a lot. Sarah first started talking about them in December of last year and my wife and I explained that those theories are anti-semitic and we told her not to let them bother her. Unfortunately, this only got worse and she began to discover communities online of people who believe the government puts chemicals in food and water to keep the masses under control. \n\nShe began to refuse to attend school in late February because she believed the school system was indoctrinating people for the 'elite' and she also began to refuse food that wasn't organic. We've been trying to accommodate her by getting organic where we can but it's hard to come by where we live. When she started doing this, we took her to the GP immediately and he said that he believed she was developing a mental illness that involved psychosis. He made an urgent referral for the psychiatrist and he prescribed her some anti-anxiety medications to help calm her down now as these theories have made her so anxious that she won't sleep. Her psychiatry appointment is in two weeks and she's refusing her medication.\n\nWhen I cared for my elderly grandparents, I was advised by their doctors to hide their medication in food to get them to take it so I decided to do with the same with Sarah. I put the tablets in a smoothie a few days ago and she showed almost immediate improvements and actually slept for a full night for the first time in weeks so I've been doing it everyday now. She also agreed to go to school yesterday for the first time in weeks and her teachers said she was almost like her old self.\n\nWhen I told my son about what I had done, he was horrified. He said that if Sarah found out, she would be devastated but she's clearly not in her right mind now. She probably would've been prescribed meds by the psychiatrist anyway and if she refused those, she could be sent to a ward which I know is traumatic. I view my actions as the lesser of two evils because although Sarah hasn't given permission, I did it for her own good because her mother and I couldn't stand to see our little girl not sleeping, barely eating and missing vital education for her GCSEs.

If you\u2019re going to secretly dose your daughter against her will, your son doesn\u2019t deserve to be made a party to that. That was unfair to him. Leave him out of it. \n\nIf you\u2019re telling ANYONE, let alone a teenager, it makes me wonder if you\u2019ve thought this through. You\u2019re not keeping this much of a secret.

I hope everything gets sorted out soon!", "I hope you realize you are setting your daughter up for a lifetime of never being able to trust you or mental health professionals. \n\nMy parents did something similar with regards to forced medication for a child (who was not me). It took forever for that kid to get necessary mental health care because it had been made non consensual in their head. It took me forever to get meds because I only saw it as something that would be forced on you,  and I still don't see therapists based on that and another experience with the therapist my parents had me see. \n\nAre you scared and trying to do the only thing you think will help your daughter? Of course and I sympathize greatly. Are you no doubt worsening her issues down the road? Also yes. \"Daughter, people in power wouldn't use something in food to control the masses\" says person putting drugs in her food. \n\nI'm not putting a y.ta or n.ta here thing because I understand your fear and recognize it from my own parents. I'm just hoping you hear from the perspective of someone on the other side of this.

I would  have a chat with the psych to brainstorm some better strategies tho...", "Gonna just throw this out there that right now you need to get her out if psychosis.\n\nGiving her something to help sleep is a temporary thing, you probably can't live with the guilt. I get why you're doing it, but you know you can't do it forever.\n\nI can't say you're anything, because you're potentially looking at having to hospitalize your baby, and having had to do that to someone I love, it's hard.\n\nBut if she gets to that level of not knowing reality from not reality, you take her to the ER, you tell them everything, you get her the help she needs... She will not be happy about it at first at all... But it may save her life.", "NTA for doing it but sir.

Can you imagine what it would be like to believe the government is drugging people without their consent and then find out your own parents were *actually* doing that?? \n\nHowever, I completely understand why you did it! \n\nDefinitely talk with the psychiatrist about what to do to move forward and *before* deciding whether or not/how to tell her. \n\nAlso get her into therapy **immediately**.\n\nAnd maybe think about therapy for yourselves as parents - having a child with this kind of issue is a lot to process and cope with.\n\nGood luck!!", "NTA- as a parent of child with significant ADHD and also SPD, I've always allowed them to make their own decisions regarding medication. After a few years they decided it's better to take the medication. BUT as an adult with bipolar disorder that has been through psychosis a few times, your daughter is not in a place where she can make rational decisions for herself, and at 15 she is still a child. I think a lot of people saying you're the AH either don't have children or have never seen a person having a true psychotic episode. You wouldn't let a child stick their hand in a fire because of \"body autonomy\" you wouldn't let a diabetic child not take insulin because \"it's their choice\". A doctor prescribed this medication. If she had a severe infection and you didn't follow a prescribed course of action people would be on here calling you an anti-science nutjob and say you have your kid taken away. This is an emergency situation. You are doing the right thing by getting her to a psychiatrist as soon as you can. It must be an incredibly hard thing to go through. Your only other option is having her committed to a psych ward. It may still come to that, but if you can avoid it by getting her the appropriate treatment without hospitalization, that's your best course. Good luck. You shouldn't have told your son though.", "You're NTA for doing that\n\nYTA for telling your son, because than he has to 'choose sides'\n\nBut basically you're digging yourself into a hole.\n\nIf she is indeed psychotic - she will stay this way, even if she isn't under anxiety, so you're not really addressing the situation.\n\nAnd if it's just anxiety - is it worst breaking your trust? And how would you make her take her pills when she's an adult? It's very close. You'll need double the trust then.\n\nTalk with a psychiatrist/psychologits who sees the whole picture", "Sorry but YTA\n\nI understand you\u2019re in a terrible situation but as someone who has dealt with mental health issues most of my life, she\u2019s better off facing them with a psychiatrist than being secretly drugged. \n\nAdditionally, this alters the behavior going into the psychiatric appointment and may make her think she\u2019s getting better on her own because she doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s been taking the meds. You\u2019ll have to tell the psychiatrist about the dosing and inevitably your daughter. Because of that she will not only need to deal with the psychosis but also the broken trust. \n\nShe may be admitted to get her to take her medications and work through this instance of psychosis, but it\u2019s better to face that as a family than call in-patient the greater evil.", "NTA, her mental problems are serious and you're her parents, it's your responsibility to protect her even if it's from herself.  Your son doesn't seem to understand the severity of the situation.   I know you didn't come here for advice about this but I'd also get her tf away from social media...TikTok and YouTube and Twitter etc are hellscapes for impressionable minds.", "YTA. She has paranoia about the government putting chemicals in food and water, and you\u2019re going to slip meds into her food?  When she finds out (because she will) it\u2019s going to reinforce her paranoia for sure. \n\nShe is a minor, and you are in control of her medical care, so I don\u2019t fault you for what you did necessarily. I understand you were desperate, but it\u2019s a short term solution with the potential for greater long term consequences.", "At least you realise it's the lesser of 2 evils. It IS evil though, and you need to have a plan in place in case she finds out. And also look for better options. But NTA And I hope your daughter finds the helps she needs and feels better soon!", "I'm going with NTA. I do think that your actions were not good, but certainly the lesser evil and frankly, I'm not sure I would've acted differently. To see your own daughter practically destroy her own mental health (and future, since she stopped going to school) by consuming these harebrained conspiracy theories must be incredibly disheartening and frustrating.", "I don't understand the Y T A in this. He has an appointment with a psych in two weeks. Exactly what is he supposed to do in the interim? He's taken her electronics away so she at least inst getting into anymore of this content. \n\nSo based on most of y'all's logic, she's supposed to starve herself and stop eating and stop going to school for two (or possibly more) weeks? Y'all need to read OPs comments first. He's in an impossible situation here. \n\nI've been witness to several psychotic breaks and those people CANNOT be reasoned with. It doesn't matter what you try. It's a short term solution until the psych can give more directions. \n\nNTA op. I hope you get this squared away (and I hope you plan to ban or severely limit SM accounts in the future).", ">Unfortunately, this only got worse and she began to discover communities online of people who believe the government puts chemicals in food and water to keep the masses under control. \n\n\nI'm not gonna judge as I get you are doing whatever you can, but if her obsession is around the above, she is going to get much worse if (more likely when) she finds out you have been doing exactly what she fears. You may want to get some advice from the psychiatrist when you get to see them about how to handle the eventual fallout from this.", "YTA (though one who's pushed to their limit but lack of mental health support)- this is a band aid and a dangerous one.  What if she finds out?  She'll never eat anything you give her ever again.  Nor will she eat what your wife give her.  Good luck getting her to do what you want in future.  Good luck getting food into her, let alone meds.\n\nIts a complete betrayal of her trust and she will never forgive you, even once she gets well.\n\nIts also very dangerous.\n\nWhat if she goes out for a night or stays somewhere else?  She'll miss her meds, and is at risk of withdrawing without understanding it.\n\nWhat if she only has half or a bit of what you've hidden it.  People's dietary moods change minute by minute.  You won't get consistent dosing which is dangerous.\n\nWhat if she's getting low grade side effects?  A bit of nausea and vomiting, but she won't know its medication related.  What if she got a big side effect?  A lot of the antipsychotic meds have side effects. She wouldn't know what's been happening.  What if she attended hospital/doctor without your knowledge, she's old enough to see them without you.  She's at risk of a drug error, because the medical team won't know she's on these drugs.\n\nWe had a patient on the children's ward under the mental health act.  She couldn't refuse drugs and we had legal powers to force feed her.  The psychiatric team were very clear, that for all of the above reasons, she had to know she what she was being given.  We gave them for two days without her knowledge (because of misunderstanding specialist advice).", "I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m really sorry that you are going through this, there is no winning in situations like this, and honestly I would probably do the same in your shoes. Continue to seek treatment for your daughter and advocate for her.", "Difficult situation for all involved. Talk to the doctor.  If involuntary treatment is warranted your doctor needs to be involved.  NTA and I am so sorry.", "NAH\nBUT you are setting yourself up for a huge fall here. If she finds out you have done this all trust will be lost. It's devastating to watch your child unravel but this might not have been the best option (I don't have any other suggestions though so what do I know?). Does she understand her fixations aren't helpful? Is there anyway you could get involved to help her learn more about the medication and how it could help her so that she's taking it voluntarily. Also if she is medicated without her knowledge you need to keep an extra close eye on her regarding drinking etc (yes I know she's only 15 but it could still be an issue, so only out with trusted friends etc).", "YTA- You're trying to help your daughter sure; but medicating her against her wishes is extremely unlikely to end well. It could cause many more trust issues- with food and with you.    \n\n\nWere you advised to secretly medicate your daughter like you were you grandparents? It seems like the advice might be quite different with a patient that already has severe trust issues.  \n\n\nAs a child, I had doctors try to medicate me against my will be putting meds I was refusing in my food in an inpatient setting. It caused eating disorders I'm still working through 20+ years later.", "Please get a secondary psychiatric opinion to be sure your kid is not showing early pre-psychosis symptoms. NTA but def shady and not sustainable.", "I\u2019m not saying YTA necessarily, but you\u2019re doing exactly what she was afraid of. Putting drugs in her food to keep her under control. \nAlso, as someone with ADHD and a tendency to hyper fixate, why aren\u2019t you just introducing some other media for her to switch that fixation to? It takes a while sometimes, but it\u2019s doable. A while ago I was obsessed with how my nails looked to the point where I\u2019d make them bleed by shaping or cutting them. I fixed it. Maybe send her some funny TikTok\u2019s for her to watch and it will change her FYP to something less chaotic.", "YTA but I get it. You need to urgently see if you can get her to take them willingly now that she's somewhat more stable so you can stop with the deception though.", "I mean technically YTA for altering someone's food without their knowledge, however I understand your reasoning. Like stated above you need to come up with a plan for WHEN she finds out.", "That\u2019s such a tough situation, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with it. I can\u2019t judge, I don\u2019t think, as I\u2019m not a parent and can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through. But I do wonder, if she\u2019s getting back to her old self now, could you talk to her about taking the medication again? Maybe she\u2019ll be more open to it now and then you could limit the time you\u2019re giving it to her without her knowing?", "NTA.  When a baby is sick and doctor says medicine, you give it to them.  They don't get to refuse.  Your child is in immediate danger. Mental illness is illness and shouldn't be treated any other way.  Alex is not her parent and has no right to judge you.  I would be afraid he would tell her so be careful.  I also agree, talk with her about taking the medication on her own at this time.  \n\nI had a friend that was in the mental health field.  When patients came in with a break down and would fight them, they would give them the medication that was needed, forcefully.  Afterward, the patients THANKED THEM for taking care of them.\n\nYour daughter isn't able to make good decisions for herself right now.\n\nYour daughter is lucky to have you there looking out for you.  Best of wishes to you and yours.", "YTA. If you think her fixation in conspiracy theories was bad, just wait until she finds out her father slipped drugs into her food without her knowledge. Now she has a very real and valid concern for shit that should have never ever happened in the first place. You done fucked up man, and completely broke any trust your child has for you in the future.", "YTA.\n\nBoy did YOU F'up... \n\n\"The government is putting chemicals in our food to control us!\".... you call her delusional and seek help. Then YOU proceed to put chemicals in her food to control her!\n\nIf she finds out, you just ruined every ounce of trust this girl could have had. \n\n* Wouldn't have made sense to remove social media from you houshold? I assume you pay the bills and buy the technology enabling this behavior? \n* I have ADHD as a full-grown adult and it's not what you think it is. Hyper fixations are normal, but a healthy interest is important to find.", "YTA for the following, what happens to her when she finds out you've been slipping the meds in her smoothies? Whatever trust she has in you will be gone. And What happens when she sees a doctor and they need to know what she's on and she doesn't know she's been taking the medication?

No amount of asking from any of my family members got her to take the correct meds or go to her psych appointments. \n\nPeople that are going through psychotic breaks cannot be reasoned with and sometimes you have to do the lesser of two evils until a better option comes up. Which OP is clearly doing by getting her in to see a psychiatrist.", "OP I am so sorry you are going through this. I sent a DM to talk about tips and tricks for reproaching your daughter to willingly take her medications.\n\nI don\u2019t have children and I am not God, so I can\u2019t judge your actions. Big hugs to you and your family, I know how difficult mental illness is in your loved ones.", "You can\u2019t just have someone committed.  The family is powerless to do anything unless the person who has the problem wants help.  It literally needs to get to the point where they are going to harm themselves or someone else and even then it\u2019s a struggle to get the system to engage.  I\u2019m not saying what OP did was right, but many have no idea what it\u2019s like having a family member with severe mental health struggles and no options to help when they don\u2019t want to help themselves.", "My daughter is a mentally-ill child who is probably in psychosis. Do you know what that means? It means someone has lost their grip on what is real and what isn't. You're extremely ableist and stupid.", "[deleted]", "You can\u2019t fix American stupidity. u/RedditIsFascist1289 sounds like the typical hateful American.", "It's not an arm chair diagnosis idiot. Her GP, a professional who spent 10 years training for his role as a doctor, said that he suspects it's a mental illness with psychosis involved. I said that in my post, can you read?", "Don\u2019t listen to this person. They\u2019re clearly someone who\u2019s had the privilege of never dealing with a mentally ill family member. Speaking as someone who has, I empathize with your situation. There\u2019s nothing wrong with your daughter other than a chemical imbalance in her brain. Please understand, if you take anything else away from this, that mental health is an art and not an exact science. There\u2019s no quick fix because balancing chemicals changes person to person. \n\nI don\u2019t know when this time is going to be, but you\u2019re going to have to come clean to your daughter eventually and face potential fallout for your actions. But I can\u2019t say that I would have done things differently in your shoes."]}
