I didn\u2019t mind at all, in fact, I was happy we shared an interest. Once she saw mine she got furious and demanded that I give her my t-shirt. At first I laughed it out because I thought she was joking, but when she stared me dead serious, I knew it wasn\u2019t a joke at all. My brother asked if I could trade t-shirts with his girlfriend because she likes the team more and \u201chas German blood\u201d. I told him it was not my problem that he didn\u2019t buy her the most recent one and that hell no I wasn\u2019t giving her my t-shirt. That she was acting like a brat for feeling entitled to have something that was a present for me. He then called me a selfish brat and an asshole for not sharing, but honestly I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in the wrong here.

Of course. Should you share one of the shoes on your feet? Of course not. She is an entitled idiot and your brother is an enabler. Hold the line.

I told her no, it\u2019s an AUTOGRAPHED guitar, not just some random electric guitar.  She told me I was selfish for not wanting to give it to her.  Then she turned around and tried to give it to her in front of me by saying that I\u2019d won this guitar and felt she should have it. I looked at her and my other sister, then my niece, and told her I\u2019m sorry, you Aunt M (sister) is a little nuts. It\u2019s special to me and explained to her why and that no, I was not looking to give it away.  My niece totally got it and said she wouldn\u2019t give it away either and was confused why M said so when I\u2019d already said no.  She tried to talk her way out of it and how S was learning guitar etc., but it really made me see the other times she had done this to me before in front of others with items I owned and usually I would just be agreeable.
