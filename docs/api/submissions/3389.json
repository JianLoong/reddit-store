There are a lot more ways to qualify if you have German parents (some weirdly sexist, like only counting the father's German citizenship if you were born before 1975 and your parents were married; why was that not amended?).\n\nWhereas in the US and, IIRC, much of the Western Hemisphere, it's pretty much you're born here, here's your citizenship.  In the US, it's the Reconstruction-Era Amendment that all the white nationalists hate, because it was created to correct the idiocy of the *Dredd Scott* decision, which declared that the enslaved were not citizens even though they were born on American soil, and has had the effect of protecting all kinds of people that the bastards don't want here.\n\nI will say that one benefit the nostalgia for the Old Country/focus on blood that weirds out Europeans has in America: as long as White ethnics have strong ethnic ties to their own cultures, they're less likely to think of themselves as generic White people.
