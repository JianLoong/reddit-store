She wasn\u2019t strong enough to stop their abuse and she is counting on you to fulfill her last wish. Also charge them fair market you need to keep up the house and pay taxes.", "NTA - your grandma was right. Uncle got his inheritance and then some. If they can\u2019t afford their lifestyle, they don\u2019t get to ask for handouts. They can downsize and adapt their lifestyle to their budget. \n\nAt this point if they don\u2019t stop harassing you, you should evict them and rent the house out at market value.", "NTA. These were your grandmother's explicit wishes plus she left it to you so it is now yours. Arguably she left it to you in your dad's place so - what would he want you to do? Would he want you to be drained by them like your grandmother was?", "NTA - stand firm and remember your Grandma's wishes. She thought you were the best person to inherit - don't let your Uncle ever convince you otherwise", "NTA. I agree with your grandma\u2019s decision and you staying strong against him. Might be time to limit contact with him and his family.", "NTA- if there is nothing good of a relationship with your uncle and his family I would say to sell the house and go no contact. This is costing you more energy than needed IMO", "NTA obviously, they all sound awful.  Why are you only charging half rent?  You'll never be free of them and they'll never be grateful for the good deal you are providing them.", "NTA. Your grandmother clearly wanted you to have it and she had every right to decide how to distribute her assets. Your uncle and his family have been exploiting your grandmother for years and have shown no gratitude or respect for her. They have no claim to her estate and they are being greedy and selfish. You are honoring your grandmother\u2019s wishes and memory by keeping what she left you. You are also being fair and reasonable by charging rent to your uncle\u2019s kids who are staying in the house. You have no obligation to help them financially or otherwise. They are adults and they need to take responsibility for their own lives.", "NTA at all. This is what your grandmother wanted, and she trusted you with her wishes. You\u2019ve been nicer to them than they deserve, letting them live on cheap rent.", "NTA\n\nYour uncle is an abusive, manipulative mooch and he thinks that if he threatens you, or rather manipulates you, that you will capitulate and give him what he wants.  Don't.\n\nIssue an eviction notice (or notice to vacate). You can up the rent to market levels first if you want and when he doesn't pay the proper amount, then issue the eviction.\n\nI think I would handball this to your lawyer and your uncle can deal with them.  It may cost you to have a lawyer but it will probably cost you less than if you try and deal with your uncle yourself.", "NTA! Its what your grandmother wanted! (And frankly what they deserve...)\nTbh you're being too kind only asking for half the rent...!", "NTA. Your grandma gave the uncle his inheritance. He got it. You got your dads. It\u2019s rightfully yours. If he was alive it would have been his half. He\u2019s passed away and it has naturally gone to you. You\u2019re within your right to cut them off and be a silent landlord or evict them from your home.", "Anyone who expects a inheritance and is planning to live off it it TA.
