For the past couple of weeks she has been complaining to me and my wife about her roommates constantly having people over. I've told her to talk to her roommates about it and she says she will soon but she never did it.\n\nHer putting off the problem culiminated in her having a panic attack today. Apparently, her roommates went out with their friends and got drunk, and when they came back, even more random people were in the room. She was doing homework and when two random drunk dudes hopped on her bed she started crying. She went outside the building and called me very frantically at 11pm asking to be picked up because she couldn't be there (we are only 15 minutes away). I said no. I told her that she's an adult and needs to figure out how to deal with these things because she cannot always come crying to us. Obviously I was not trying to sound harsh and was not speaking in a harsh tone but she hung up on me. I have tried calling her back and texting her and she will not respond. Did I really mess up or was I right to let her deal with this on her own?", "created_utc": 1696653336, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171xek0/aita_for_not_picking_my_daughter_up_after_she_had/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I deal with them myself and definitely call my parents still when I have them because they are no joke! She was trying to find a safe place with you in a state of panic. Its not her fault that random drunk people were on her bed and invading her space, as that's just rude lol. \nShe can deal with the issue when she's calm and collected and will have to learn to communicate it to her roommates if she wants the situation to improve, but she's still learning how to be on her own and needs her family!", "YTA\n\nYour daughter needed help and you turned her away. Yes, she needs to learn how to help herself, but the time for that lesson isn't when random drunk guys are jumping on her bed and freaking her out.", "Wow, what kind of father is okay with drunk college guys jumping into their 19yo daughter's bed in the middle of the night?! Especially when she's shy and prone to panic attacks, which are nothing to take lightly. YTA!!", "You know\u2026.\n\n\u2026.most fathers who got a call from their sobbing daughter because two strange, drunk men invaded her bedroom in the middle of the night would be more than a little concerned.

No. \n\nYou\u2019re a bad father. \n\nYTA \n\nYou\u2019d better hope the reason she isn\u2019t answering your calls is because she\u2019s upset with you, and not because she decided to \u201cfigure it out\u201d and something happened to her.", "YTA. Your daughter has anxiety, and clearly has issues with confrontation due to the anxiety. She would never, EVER tell her roommates how she\u2019s feeling. When you have anxiety, you\u2019re absolutely controlled by the inner thoughts and what if\u2019s.. You\u2019re telling me you were 15 mins away, but couldn\u2019t go get her and bring her to a safe place? Panic attacks are not fun. It can be debilitating. I would be ashamed of myself.

Are you trying to tell us you would *not* be upset if two drunk dudes were in your room uninvited jumping on *your* bed?! If that happened to you, would you perhaps call someone to help kick them out?! That's what your daughter did. And you showed her you can't be counted on. \n\nAnd why do you think a conversation with her roommates would fix everything? If the roommates are so inconsiderate as to create this type of situation in the first place, they already *know* it's not okay, and they just don't care.

Your daughter is fresh out of the house and clearly ill-equipped to deal with this situation. As a parent your job is to help her adapt to being on her own.

That's not a gamble any woman is willing to take - anxiety or not. Trying to communicate an issue while its occuring with your drunk roommate is also not going to work out great.

By getting ignored when asking for help?\n\nYTA", "Some drunk dudes hopped into your daughters bed and you told her to just deal with it? YTA big time", "YTA.

TERRIBLE. \n\n\u201cHer putting off the problem\u201d caused the issue?? No. Her DIAGNOSABLE MEDICAL CONDITION CAUSED THE ISSUE IN A TOTALLY PREDICTABLE WAY. You told her to \u201ctalk to her roommates\u201d about this?? Are you fucking kidding?? Of COURSE she couldn\u2019t do that! It would given her a panic attack! And when she did have a panic attack you told her \u201cshe\u2019s an adult\u201d and she needs to \u201cfigure out how to deal with these things\u201d? Because real adults don\u2019t have\u2026 crippling mental illness? Those are things that, what, children have or something? What?

FOREVER.", "If the situation involved her sober roommates, in a public space, and she wasn't having a panic attack, that would have been good advice.

A potential emergency is not the time. YTA", "YTA. You didn\u2019t have to go pick her up- but telling your kid to grow up in the middle of a panic attack is just\u2026 mean. Helping her calm down, asking her if there is an RA she can talk to- all of that would have actually been helpful.", "YTA -Panic attacks are nothing to take lightly! Many people often think that they\u2019re dying when they first start having one. And what she needed in that moment was a safe space with someone she trusted so that she would be able to calm down. And that was you. But you failed to provide that. She may be an adult, but that doesn\u2019t make you her father any less.", "YTA I've just turned 41 and if I phoned my mum saying I'm having a panic attack or something was wrong if she didn't get her arse down here in superman time she would at least try and talk me through it. Why would you not do either of those things. She's young and panic attacks are so scary all you did was let her know you aren't there for her", "Personally, YTA\nSure she is an adult, but a few months ago she most likely heavily relied on y\u2019all. I think that you could have tried to talk about it more and calm her down to go in and make sure she talks to her roommates. I remember as a freshman in college I was very shy and hesitant to talk about some issues I have with my roommates. You could have given her advice to talk to her RA about the situation or other solutions, but it seems that the conversation wasn\u2019t helpful in a time where she was looking for support.", "YTA. Are you waiting for your daughter to be assaulted before you realise she may be in a trouble she can't get herself out of it?\n\nMiddle of the night, multiple drunk guys on her bed and you are telling her to sort it out herself. Giving her a safe place until she could resolve the longterm issues with the RA and management team the next day isn't running from her problems. \n\nHave you checked she is actually well? Her diagnosis doesn't really matter in this situation. She felt realistically at immediate risk as many women would and you brushed her off.", "YTA. She's in a new environment, trying to figure her life out, and when she needs your help you show her that she can't count on you.\n\nI can't imagine how utterly alone she feels right now.", "YTA - To leave out details, I had something similar happen as a freshman.  Uninvited drunk guys, one of which invaded my dorm room while I was studying and wouldn't leave.  I assume his beer goggles told him he could get laid.  Know how that got solved?  The RA or resident advisor.  I don't have any kind of social anxiety but I also had no clue how the fuck to rid myself of a drunk man prowling the hallways of a freshman women's dorm.  \n\nYou don't generally tell college women to take on their roommates, especially when they're in an inferior position being outnumbered by bullies or potential rapists.  You tell them to use campus resources like RAs, like  campus police, like using title 9.\n\nBeing an adult means helping women placed in danger by others' drunk decisions.", "She\u2019s not an adult.

How bad is your household that this is preferable?", "I sincerely hope your wife told you to eat shit and drove to pick your daughter herself.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. I\u2019d be panicking too if my room was packed with drunk people (men especially!) who I didn\u2019t know. Plus you\u2019re only 15 minutes away.", "YTA\u2026 and I hope nothing bad happened to your poor daughter.

How safe do you think she feels now?", "Dude that\u2019s the exact opposite way to support someone experiencing panic attacks.

With anything.", "100% YTA. She had a freaking panic attack- you do understand that these are straight up terrifying breaks with reality, right??? Let alone that at the end of the day what random pll entering her room at night is an extremely unsafe situation.\n\nI get that she needs to learn how to be independent, but you protect her during the time of need then troubleshoot in the morning. If she has diagnosed OCD/ anxiety, it might be worth talking to an RA or the ADA office about accommodations- she might qualify for her own room or something", "YTA. It\u2019s your kid and she needed you. That sounds like a horrible position to be in and you were only 15 min away? Seriously? You messed up. You\u2019re always going to be her parent and you need to act like it. You\u2019re showing her that she can\u2019t rely on you for serious things.

Ever read *any* rape statistic or even remotely heared about sexuall assaukt in college or anywhere else for that matter? People like your are classic victim blamers...anyone would have had a panic attac, not only your ocd daughter. You pretend like her deficits are the problem, not others overstepping her boundaries that should be clear without saying.

What the heck is wrong with you?", "I'm not a parent, but I can tell you that if a niece (or nephew) or friend's kid called me in this situation, I'd make the 15 minute drive in a much quicker time. You didn't even need to pick her up, but you did need to show up. Sit with her till she was in a better place. Grab ice cream and talk. Whatever, until she can manage it.\nAlso, I don't think that this room mate situation is going to be mentally and emotionally healthy for her. Can she move?\nYTA, but I want to give you the benefit of the doubt because you can't be that bad if she called you. Do better. Quickly.", "Damn you a actual dogshit father. God forbid she got SA\u2019d holy shit", "YTA: \n\nYour daugther seems to have a psychological issue here which she might be feeling bad for when having to confront others. You seem to want her growing up and stand up for herself, which is understandable as a parent. But by simply telling her to do something she wont be able to act in that way. She needs understanding and someone guiding her how she can learn how to tell others what she wants and doesnt want. Screaming at her in a moment of a breakdown is really harsh and hurting in a moment like this. She needed mental support.", "YTA You could at the very least have suggested ways to deal with this herself.\n\"Did you talk to the RA on your floor? Can they they help you get these drunk guys out of your room?\"\n\nAnd if she's too anxious upset to do that - just go get her and help her come up with a plan to talk to the RA on Monday, request a new roommate, something. \n\nYes, you want her to learn to be independent but that doesn't mean refusing to ever help her at all. Think how badly this could go for her with two drunk guys on her bed!", "YTA and not even a logical one. Her roommate and these guests were drunk and unruly making them potentially dangerous, plus she was hugely outnumbered. Panic attacks or \u201cdealing with it on her own\u201d aside, the right and smart thing to do at that moment was distance herself from the situation. Then deal with the discussions later when roommate is sober. What else was she supposed to do at that point if it\u2019s 11pm and she can\u2019t sleep in her own room - find some random person on campus to crash in their floor? No, she did the smart thing which is call her parents so she can come sleep in her own bed safe and sound. She couldn\u2019t do that, she couldn\u2019t go back to her room - do you even know what she did?? Not winning parent if the year, and this incident likely left a pretty lasting mark on her.

YTA.", "You can't \"tough love\" someone out of having OCD jesus fucking christ. YTA", "YTA. You make a valid point but dude - that was the wrong time and wrong way to make it", "YTA - She does need to learn to deal with it on her own, but that does not happen over night. Your daughter who is just learning to be on her own and dealing with the exacerbation of difficult mental health problems in the transition really needed some love and support from her dad, but you completely let her down by deciding to coldly tell her to deal with it on her own. While I don\u2019t necessarily think you needed to rush over to pick her up immediately, you could have at least tried to sympathize with her and help her calm down a bit. Take audible deep, steady breaths or ask her questions about what she is currently seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, etc. to help ground her in reality. Then you could have given her some ideas of what to say or do when she goes back inside. \n\nI know you might find it frustrating to deal with someone having a panic attack when you do not have them yourself, but take it from someone who knows from countless firsthand experiences, they are absolutely terrifying. You can\u2019t breathe or think clearly, like there\u2019s an elephant on your chest or a rock in your throat and your brain has turned to goo. The world feels like it\u2019s spinning at warp speed while your mind races, and your eyes can\u2019t focus on anything. It feels like your heart is pounding so hard it might burst out of your chest or just suddenly stop, and that will be the end of you. It can be almost impossible to find a coherent, logical thought in that state, let alone calm yourself down enough to come up with a plan of action for the situation. \n\nYou really need to apologize to your daughter and find a middle ground way to help her while also giving her little pushes to figure out how to do more of it on her own next time. I hope she is in therapy to learn coping skills and has medication (if possible) to help deal with symptoms while she goes to therapy.", "YTA I hope you understand that in her mind at that time because it was so jumbled you basically abandoned her when she had to random GUYS in your 19yr DAUGHTERS bed, why the hell would you not go and pick her up, she\u2019s was clearly distressed and was obviously not up to staying there and you practically just told her she can\u2019t call you whenever she feels unsafe or uncomfortable because you\u2019ll never be there to help her, you have to apologise and actually make a change to start being there for her in times like that", "YTA like supreme A.H status o.p .

Hopefully she could and did get to a safer space that you wouldn\u2019t give her. She\u2019s also what 18-19? She lived and depended on you for years so it makes sense she would still want your help. Don\u2019t listen to the people saying she\u2019s being overly dramatic or that she\u2019s a full grown adult. It was a real situation for her and you screwed up.

She may prefer anywhere else but your home in the future.", "THATS THE COMMENT YOU RESPOND TO \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nYou have a LONG way to go to make up for your actions before that girl moves back in your house so good luck. Tred lightly OP, you\u2019re not stupid. You hear the stories about parents who have no contact from their kids, you hear the stories about how the younger generation will not tolerate toxic relationships and will cut people off to protect themselves.\n\nThis will be you if you\u2019re not careful.", "And there is typically an exception if you\u2019re living at home and commuting. Congratulations for sucking even more and not looking into it. \n\nBut no. She won\u2019t come home.", "You left your 19 year old daughter alone with a couple of drunk guys who stormed her room and invaded her personal space. The room that she paid for. Do you have any idea how that situation could have played out the other way?", "No she won't now,  you'll be lucky if you get any part of her life going forward, YTA!!!", "That sounds like a bit of a cash grab. Is this some kind of religious institution that wants to control their students\u2019 behaviour after hours?", "Great point about the time to deal with it is the next day not at the time of the actual panic attack! \n\nFurther, OP has muddled the situation because she was actually in a potentially life threatening situation so her \u201cpanic attack\u201d was actually just a normal response to a dangerous situation. \n\nThe title of the post should actually be AITA for not picking my daughter up when random men came into her room in the middle of the night when she was sleeping and terrified her because she also sometimes gets panic attacks so I just assume her feelings aren\u2019t ever valid", "they want the incels to like them thats all", "I read the whole story. She was up doing homework and two drunk men got on her bed, probably because dorm rooms don't have many places to sit. OP should have done more for his daughter but the whole story doesn't have any indication that the roommate's drunk friends were going to assault anyone.", "When her parents die, what is she going to do then? It doesn\u2019t seem healthy to have her constantly rely on them for her issues she\u2019ll have to deal with alone eventually.", "She is an adult!", "How was she sexual harassed. 2 guys jumped on her bed while she was awake", "Wow what a silly comment. Both situations involve rude men making a girl uncomfortable and invading space.\n\nWhy are you assuming that these guys weren\u2019t also random? Quite common to meet someone and drunkenly bring them back to the dorm the same night. Plus OP\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t know them, so they are completely random to her.", "How are they not comparable? Presumably other people also knew that guy in the hallway, the big problem is that the girl who was harassed didn't know them.", "You\u2019re so fcked up in your head jfc", "Projection.", "My Ex had a panick attack once while I was with him.\n\nSCARIEST SHIT I HAVE EVER SEEN.\n\nHe wasn't cramping he just slowly slided down a wall and sat on the floor with a thousand yard stare. In between he started crying but the way he was just staring blankly was just so much worse for me, he didn't react to anything I did.\n\nCan you imagine what some drunk college boys could do to a woman who just sat on the floor not moving? I don't even wanna imagine what could have happened to her...\n\nYTA OP, help her talk to her roommates, don't condescend her because she can't do it alone", "It does sound silly though when you say it out loud", "The dishes, the laundry, cooking meals, who was driving who to what practice - uh un. I would not live 15 minutes away from that duty roster even now.", "That\u2019s assuming she doesn\u2019t kill herself first, either deliberately or by self-medicating, since she is having a serious mental health crisis and has been telling her parents for weeks about it and they told her to \u201cdeal with it\u201d.", "Most require this.

Get real, she was in danger and her sperm donor ignored that fact.\n\n I read this story to my husband a couple of hours ago. We have an adult daughter. Even today he\u2019d be in there swinging punches. And quite right, too.", "But they weren't to her roommates.\n\nRoommates are allowed to have guests. \n\nOP's daughter is at fault because she didn't deal with boundaries with her roommates.", "Did you never go to college? Beds are like couches for kids in the dorms.", "That phrasing is pretty telling. They\u2019re the same age, yet it\u2019s \u201crude men\u201d and \u201ca girl\u201d. So a 19 year old male is a man but a 19 year old female is just a girl? You\u2019re trying to make the males seem older/more aggressive, which is why you didn\u2019t say \u201crude boys\u201d or \u201cmaking a woman uncomfortable\u201d, because by calling the adult female a woman you\u2019re putting more responsibility on her to manage her own emotions around and about people she doesn\u2019t know.", "Yeah but most at least the ones I looked into, if you live in the school district you don't have to", "Are you comfortable having multiple random drunk men in your bed?", "Roommates are allowed to have guests on OP's daughter's bed?!", "It is totally fine to be uncomfortable with having multiple drunk men in your bed.", "lol you have too much time on your hands bud. People have different vernacular. How about those drunk little boys shouldn\u2019t be in a full grown woman\u2019s bed. Is that better for you?", "I did this, you still have to file with the university for an exception. What about this post suggests to you that this girl has the kind of parents who would help with that accommodation?"]}
