For the past couple of weeks she has been complaining to me and my wife about her roommates constantly having people over. I've told her to talk to her roommates about it and she says she will soon but she never did it.\n\nHer putting off the problem culiminated in her having a panic attack today. Apparently, her roommates went out with their friends and got drunk, and when they came back, even more random people were in the room. She was doing homework and when two random drunk dudes hopped on her bed she started crying. She went outside the building and called me very frantically at 11pm asking to be picked up because she couldn't be there (we are only 15 minutes away). I said no. I told her that she's an adult and needs to figure out how to deal with these things because she cannot always come crying to us. Obviously I was not trying to sound harsh and was not speaking in a harsh tone but she hung up on me. I have tried calling her back and texting her and she will not respond. Did I really mess up or was I right to let her deal with this on her own?", "created_utc": 1696653336, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171xek0/aita_for_not_picking_my_daughter_up_after_she_had/", "score": 1504, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I deal with them myself and definitely call my parents still when I have them because they are no joke! She was trying to find a safe place with you in a state of panic. Its not her fault that random drunk people were on her bed and invading her space, as that's just rude lol. \nShe can deal with the issue when she's calm and collected and will have to learn to communicate it to her roommates if she wants the situation to improve, but she's still learning how to be on her own and needs her family!", "YTA\n\nYour daughter needed help and you turned her away. Yes, she needs to learn how to help herself, but the time for that lesson isn't when random drunk guys are jumping on her bed and freaking her out.", "Wow, what kind of father is okay with drunk college guys jumping into their 19yo daughter's bed in the middle of the night?! Especially when she's shy and prone to panic attacks, which are nothing to take lightly. YTA!!", "You know\u2026.\n\n\u2026.most fathers who got a call from their sobbing daughter because two strange, drunk men invaded her bedroom in the middle of the night would be more than a little concerned.

No. \n\nYou\u2019re a bad father. \n\nYTA \n\nYou\u2019d better hope the reason she isn\u2019t answering your calls is because she\u2019s upset with you, and not because she decided to \u201cfigure it out\u201d and something happened to her.", "YTA. Your daughter has anxiety, and clearly has issues with confrontation due to the anxiety. She would never, EVER tell her roommates how she\u2019s feeling. When you have anxiety, you\u2019re absolutely controlled by the inner thoughts and what if\u2019s.. You\u2019re telling me you were 15 mins away, but couldn\u2019t go get her and bring her to a safe place? Panic attacks are not fun. It can be debilitating. I would be ashamed of myself.

Are you trying to tell us you would *not* be upset if two drunk dudes were in your room uninvited jumping on *your* bed?! If that happened to you, would you perhaps call someone to help kick them out?! That's what your daughter did. And you showed her you can't be counted on. \n\nAnd why do you think a conversation with her roommates would fix everything? If the roommates are so inconsiderate as to create this type of situation in the first place, they already *know* it's not okay, and they just don't care.

Your daughter is fresh out of the house and clearly ill-equipped to deal with this situation. As a parent your job is to help her adapt to being on her own.

That's not a gamble any woman is willing to take - anxiety or not. Trying to communicate an issue while its occuring with your drunk roommate is also not going to work out great.

By getting ignored when asking for help?\n\nYTA", "Some drunk dudes hopped into your daughters bed and you told her to just deal with it? YTA big time", "YTA.

TERRIBLE. \n\n\u201cHer putting off the problem\u201d caused the issue?? No. Her DIAGNOSABLE MEDICAL CONDITION CAUSED THE ISSUE IN A TOTALLY PREDICTABLE WAY. You told her to \u201ctalk to her roommates\u201d about this?? Are you fucking kidding?? Of COURSE she couldn\u2019t do that! It would given her a panic attack! And when she did have a panic attack you told her \u201cshe\u2019s an adult\u201d and she needs to \u201cfigure out how to deal with these things\u201d? Because real adults don\u2019t have\u2026 crippling mental illness? Those are things that, what, children have or something? What?

FOREVER.", "If the situation involved her sober roommates, in a public space, and she wasn't having a panic attack, that would have been good advice.

A potential emergency is not the time. YTA", "YTA. You didn\u2019t have to go pick her up- but telling your kid to grow up in the middle of a panic attack is just\u2026 mean. Helping her calm down, asking her if there is an RA she can talk to- all of that would have actually been helpful.", "YTA -Panic attacks are nothing to take lightly! Many people often think that they\u2019re dying when they first start having one. And what she needed in that moment was a safe space with someone she trusted so that she would be able to calm down. And that was you. But you failed to provide that. She may be an adult, but that doesn\u2019t make you her father any less.", "YTA I've just turned 41 and if I phoned my mum saying I'm having a panic attack or something was wrong if she didn't get her arse down here in superman time she would at least try and talk me through it. Why would you not do either of those things. She's young and panic attacks are so scary all you did was let her know you aren't there for her", "Personally, YTA\nSure she is an adult, but a few months ago she most likely heavily relied on y\u2019all. I think that you could have tried to talk about it more and calm her down to go in and make sure she talks to her roommates. I remember as a freshman in college I was very shy and hesitant to talk about some issues I have with my roommates. You could have given her advice to talk to her RA about the situation or other solutions, but it seems that the conversation wasn\u2019t helpful in a time where she was looking for support.", "YTA. Are you waiting for your daughter to be assaulted before you realise she may be in a trouble she can't get herself out of it?\n\nMiddle of the night, multiple drunk guys on her bed and you are telling her to sort it out herself. Giving her a safe place until she could resolve the longterm issues with the RA and management team the next day isn't running from her problems. \n\nHave you checked she is actually well? Her diagnosis doesn't really matter in this situation. She felt realistically at immediate risk as many women would and you brushed her off.", "YTA. She's in a new environment, trying to figure her life out, and when she needs your help you show her that she can't count on you.\n\nI can't imagine how utterly alone she feels right now.", "YTA - To leave out details, I had something similar happen as a freshman.  Uninvited drunk guys, one of which invaded my dorm room while I was studying and wouldn't leave.  I assume his beer goggles told him he could get laid.  Know how that got solved?  The RA or resident advisor.  I don't have any kind of social anxiety but I also had no clue how the fuck to rid myself of a drunk man prowling the hallways of a freshman women's dorm.  \n\nYou don't generally tell college women to take on their roommates, especially when they're in an inferior position being outnumbered by bullies or potential rapists.  You tell them to use campus resources like RAs, like  campus police, like using title 9.\n\nBeing an adult means helping women placed in danger by others' drunk decisions.", "She\u2019s not an adult.

How bad is your household that this is preferable?", "I sincerely hope your wife told you to eat shit and drove to pick your daughter herself.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. I\u2019d be panicking too if my room was packed with drunk people (men especially!) who I didn\u2019t know. Plus you\u2019re only 15 minutes away.", "YTA\u2026 and I hope nothing bad happened to your poor daughter.

How safe do you think she feels now?", "Dude that\u2019s the exact opposite way to support someone experiencing panic attacks.

With anything.", "100% YTA. She had a freaking panic attack- you do understand that these are straight up terrifying breaks with reality, right??? Let alone that at the end of the day what random pll entering her room at night is an extremely unsafe situation.\n\nI get that she needs to learn how to be independent, but you protect her during the time of need then troubleshoot in the morning. If she has diagnosed OCD/ anxiety, it might be worth talking to an RA or the ADA office about accommodations- she might qualify for her own room or something", "YTA. It\u2019s your kid and she needed you. That sounds like a horrible position to be in and you were only 15 min away? Seriously? You messed up. You\u2019re always going to be her parent and you need to act like it. You\u2019re showing her that she can\u2019t rely on you for serious things.

Ever read *any* rape statistic or even remotely heared about sexuall assaukt in college or anywhere else for that matter? People like your are classic victim blamers...anyone would have had a panic attac, not only your ocd daughter. You pretend like her deficits are the problem, not others overstepping her boundaries that should be clear without saying.

What the heck is wrong with you?", "I'm not a parent, but I can tell you that if a niece (or nephew) or friend's kid called me in this situation, I'd make the 15 minute drive in a much quicker time. You didn't even need to pick her up, but you did need to show up. Sit with her till she was in a better place. Grab ice cream and talk. Whatever, until she can manage it.\nAlso, I don't think that this room mate situation is going to be mentally and emotionally healthy for her.

God forbid she got SA\u2019d holy shit", "YTA: \n\nYour daugther seems to have a psychological issue here which she might be feeling bad for when having to confront others. You seem to want her growing up and stand up for herself, which is understandable as a parent. But by simply telling her to do something she wont be able to act in that way. She needs understanding and someone guiding her how she can learn how to tell others what she wants and doesnt want. Screaming at her in a moment of a breakdown is really harsh and hurting in a moment like this. She needed mental support.", "YTA You could at the very least have suggested ways to deal with this herself.\n\"Did you talk to the RA on your floor? Can they they help you get these drunk guys out of your room?\"\n\nAnd if she's too anxious upset to do that - just go get her and help her come up with a plan to talk to the RA on Monday, request a new roommate, something. \n\nYes, you want her to learn to be independent but that doesn't mean refusing to ever help her at all. Think how badly this could go for her with two drunk guys on her bed!", "YTA and not even a logical one. Her roommate and these guests were drunk and unruly making them potentially dangerous, plus she was hugely outnumbered. Panic attacks or \u201cdealing with it on her own\u201d aside, the right and smart thing to do at that moment was distance herself from the situation. Then deal with the discussions later when roommate is sober. What else was she supposed to do at that point if it\u2019s 11pm and she can\u2019t sleep in her own room - find some random person on campus to crash in their floor? No, she did the smart thing which is call her parents so she can come sleep in her own bed safe and sound. She couldn\u2019t do that, she couldn\u2019t go back to her room - do you even know what she did?? Not winning parent if the year, and this incident likely left a pretty lasting mark on her.

YTA.", "You can't \"tough love\" someone out of having OCD jesus fucking christ. YTA", "YTA. You make a valid point but dude - that was the wrong time and wrong way to make it", "YTA - She does need to learn to deal with it on her own, but that does not happen over night. Your daughter who is just learning to be on her own and dealing with the exacerbation of difficult mental health problems in the transition really needed some love and support from her dad, but you completely let her down by deciding to coldly tell her to deal with it on her own. While I don\u2019t necessarily think you needed to rush over to pick her up immediately, you could have at least tried to sympathize with her and help her calm down a bit. Take audible deep, steady breaths or ask her questions about what she is currently seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, etc. to help ground her in reality. Then you could have given her some ideas of what to say or do when she goes back inside. \n\nI know you might find it frustrating to deal with someone having a panic attack when you do not have them yourself, but take it from someone who knows from countless firsthand experiences, they are absolutely terrifying. You can\u2019t breathe or think clearly, like there\u2019s an elephant on your chest or a rock in your throat and your brain has turned to goo. The world feels like it\u2019s spinning at warp speed while your mind races, and your eyes can\u2019t focus on anything. It feels like your heart is pounding so hard it might burst out of your chest or just suddenly stop, and that will be the end of you. It can be almost impossible to find a coherent, logical thought in that state, let alone calm yourself down enough to come up with a plan of action for the situation. \n\nYou really need to apologize to your daughter and find a middle ground way to help her while also giving her little pushes to figure out how to do more of it on her own next time. I hope she is in therapy to learn coping skills and has medication (if possible) to help deal with symptoms while she goes to therapy.", "YTA I hope you understand that in her mind at that time because it was so jumbled you basically abandoned her when she had to random GUYS in your 19yr DAUGHTERS bed, why the hell would you not go and pick her up, she\u2019s was clearly distressed and was obviously not up to staying there and you practically just told her she can\u2019t call you whenever she feels unsafe or uncomfortable because you\u2019ll never be there to help her, you have to apologise and actually make a change to start being there for her in times like that", "YTA like supreme A.H status o.p .

Hopefully she could and did get to a safer space that you wouldn\u2019t give her. She\u2019s also what 18-19? She lived and depended on you for years so it makes sense she would still want your help. Don\u2019t listen to the people saying she\u2019s being overly dramatic or that she\u2019s a full grown adult. It was a real situation for her and you screwed up.

My cousin had told them that if at any point in the trip they couldn't figure out how to get out of DC because of the traffic, to just pull over and call my Dad, and he will help them out. Cuz had not told us any of this, so the friends called and introduced themselves and explained why they were calling after 2 hours of driving in circles. Dad calmed them down, asked where they were and how much gas they had (Mom interrupted in the background asking if they needed food and took a bathroom break), and got them on the highway. I'd like to mention here that at the time of this story, Dad had extremely unmanaged anxiety and quite a temper, but if kids were counting on him, he was getting them to safety. Mom was always on Mom mode. This happened a couple of years later with a different cousin, different group of friends, and NYC.\n\nYTA.

Though legally an \"adult\" she is still your child. She is still going to need your help. Dealing with anxiety on your own is HARD. It is important to still offer your support when you can. \n\nMore important than that, the situation your daughter was is WAS NOT SAFE. People she did not know, were invited into her living space. Two  INTOXICATED MEN were bold enough to sit on her bed without her permission. She had no say in these people being in her space. She did not know them. She did not know their intentions, and they did not know her boundaries. It was not a safe space for her to be in. That alone should have been enough for you to pick her up, or go ensure her safety. ADDITIONALLY, she was very reasonably triggered into an anxiety/panic attack, and you invalidated her feelings and need to feel safe. This wasn't just \"coming home crying.\" This was a failure as a parent, to keep your daughter safe and feelings respected. \n\nI think a good next step would be to apologize, and then sit down and talk. Try to understand what her anxiety is like and how it effects her. Offer help and support. See if there are counseling services available on her campus that she can utilize. Help her come up with a plan to establish boundaries with her roommates, as confrontation can be hard for people struggling with anxiety. This is a learning moment for everyone.

It teaches them that helping others is worth an inconvenience. \n\nI would do more for a stranger than so many of these \u201cparents\u201d would do for their own kid and it truly makes me furious sometimes.", "Right? I\u2019m almost 28 but my dad still tells me to be careful every time I\u2019m heading out somewhere and came to my college town to help me when I was 20 and something went wrong with my car. He also wanted to call the cops when he found out some sleazy guy had sent me dick pics lol. I don\u2019t get just not giving a shit what happens to your kids.", "Mya sister's car broke down halfway into the 10 hour drive back to college. My dad dropped everything, rented a minivan that would fit us and the people riding with us, and started driving just in case there was more wrong than we thought, since none of us were old enough to rent a car if it couldn't be repaired. \n\nIt's just absurd that OP is 15 minutes away and still couldn't be bothered to come in an obviously unsafe situation. YTA big time.", "Exactly!! Get her out of the situation first. Life lesson comes later with clear heads when she knows she can trust you.", "Or just....gone.", "I live in Canada and colleges here would let u stay home if u live in the same city or nearby.

Massively. Don\u2019t be surprised if your daughter goes no contact in the future if you treat her like this. What is wrong with you?", "It's because you're always on that damn phone!", "Windex.", "I hope you are in a better place now. I ones told my mom that I wanted to commit suicide but I didn\u2019t and she told me that it was shit of me to make her feel like a bad mom. I got a support system now and people who care for me, I really hope you do to. \u2764\ufe0f", "Or campus security", "I moved home for 1 summer in college and swore I would never go back. I became the errand person, chauffeur to younger siblings, etc. All this while working crazy hours to try and save for some upcoming student expenses. I suddenly wasn't treated like an adult and hated it.", "We always joke she's a cyborg. She's got an AV fistula in her wrist and artificial lenses in her eyes. Nothing hi tech but it adds to the cannon of the Mominator lol.", "Tons and tons of good techniques and management tricks to prevent and deescalate panic attacks.  Voiding my personality aka emptying my mind and focusing on the world around me rather than the world of panic inside usually helps.  I feel like the more I look at the panic inside the stronger the panic inside gets.\nLast time my basement flooded there was like 5 feet of water down there and I started having a strong feelings of panic and fear that going into the water would electrocute me. Eventually had to go outside and get some fresh air and stop thinking about it so I could calm down and then go deal with it.\nI took a guided meditation class in high school that really helped me learn how to quiet my mind and anxieties, might be a good skill to learn if you struggle with worry like I do.", "The fact that there were three drunk men in her bed and he still thought she should deal with it on her own? Like not even call the ra or the police??? Idk. This is so ridiculous I can\u2019t even fathom", "So would mine. I remember getting stranded in a neighboring state the night before he flew out of the country for a work trip and he *still* made the 10 hour roundtrip drive to get me.", "Ssme my Dad lives hours away, but if I cslled him crying and in need he would already be driving.", "Yes that is so true. My husband and I agreed from the get-go that we would be those parents. Our kids have been super open with us their whole lives because of that. They're 21 and 18 and still know that if they ever feel unsafe to call. Whether it's by people, drinking, etc, don't risk it, we've got you. \n\nA lot of people take this parenting to be like our kids had no boundaries or consequences. Which is ridiculous. You can both gentle parent and raise self sufficient, responsible productive kids. The way parenting is so polarized like that is a huge problem. \n\nAnd yes, I would also do it for strangers, too. It's just empathy and compassion.", "When I was in college, I butt dialed my dad at a Mario party 8 party. I didn't notice and my phone was always on silent (still is because I hate when phones ring or vibrate) so I didn't realize he tried to call me back until half an hour later when cops should up at my door... when I called my dad after that, he apparently had immediately started the 5 hour drive, got pulled over for speeding, then as he was let go, the cop called his buddy near my campus and they checked on me. \n\nNow that I love in France, I'm required to send either him or my mother a new picture of me weekly so they're sure I'm still alive. \n\nI can't imagine a father not trying to help in a situation like OP is describing but then again, there are some crappy dads out there. \n\nOp, YTA", "Exactly! I'm 57 and my parents still tell me to be careful. My dad still asks if I've changed the oil in my car too. I absolutely adore them for it.", "I'm happy you do \u2764\ufe0f\nI'm doing my best atm, relying on other people that I know I can count on, like my grandparents. For instance, your mom IS a bad mom. If I had a child and they told me they want to suicide, I'd be terrified rather than trying to guilty trip them. But ig life gets better when we learn who we can and who we can not count on. The only difficult thing is society romanticizing parents and judging us when we decide to cut them off, saying we're bad kids rather than noticing that parents are the adults in the relationship, and if we wanna nothing with them they're probably at fault.", "A really good friend commuted to Northwestern from our rural suburban upbringing. I admired her greatly. She asked me why I didn't just commute myself and I was like, \"Your mom runs the household like you're a student with a student's life. My mama runs her house like I'm on duty to her 24/7. I love mama. But, it gives me the collywobbles just thinking about staying at home and going to school.\"", "Agreed! That\u2019s what RA\u2019s are supposed to be for (and parents, but we know this one failed).", "Sorry in advance for this... but I'm from Northern Ireland... and I did eventually catch on that you meant call the Residents Association. \n\nWhere I'm from \"The Ra\" is shorthand for the IRA (Irish Republican Army) terrorist organisation.\n\nI mean, they could have sorted out the problem, except we had a peace process, and they don't \"sort people out\" like they used to... (lol)", "Why are there so many nut jobs in this sub? The police? Really? There was zero mention of anything criminal, violent, unsafe, just some drunk 18-19 year olds with no respect for others. \n\nCan you imagine the conversation? \u201cI\u2019m trying to study and my roommate brought home a bunch of drunk people and now I\u2019m having a panic attack\u201d. It would give the cops a good laugh.", "My mother used this style of parenting, \u201cNo matter what, if you don\u2019t feel safe, even if people are just being mean, call me and I will pick you up, you won\u2019t be in trouble.\u201d\nI only took her up on it one time, at a Slumber Party when I was 12 and everyone turned out to be a very Mean Girl, and I later found out they would have been capable of a lot more than bullying had I stayed.\nHowever, my cousins, knowing that she had this policy and wouldn\u2019t rat them out to her siblings, called her a couple of different times when they were in College and she saved their friends from lethal drug overdoses by asking questions about what and how much their friends had taken, what was going on now, pre-existing conditions, etc. and then helping them get their friends appropriate help to stay alive. All this from out of State. When everyone was panicking that they couldn\u2019t risk figuring out if the person really needed help because they would get in trouble, too, my cousins knew they could call her and trust her to help.\nThat was over a decade ago now, but now that we\u2019re all grown adults, they\u2019re still more open, honest, and affectionate about the good, the bad, and the whatever of their real lives with my mom and us than they are with their own parents and siblings.", "Agree totally. My young adult children know they can contact us day or night. Even if they have done something stupid. We are their soft place to fall. Always there for them 100%", "Both my parents used this style of parenting. I thankfully never had to call them in a situation, but I knew I could and they would be there for me.", "My daughter knows her and any of her friends can call us for help. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we won\u2019t cover up shit for them and will inform parents once they\u2019re safe, but we\u2019ll ensure they are safe.", "I\u2019m 51 and my parents still ask me to call them when I get home after I visit them so they know I\u2019m safe", "Exactly", "I\u2019m dying at this because my grandmother (Irish immigrant) was SO UPSET when my brother was talking about his new position as an RA and how his new(ish) girlfriend at the time was involved in \u201cgetting him in,\u201d because of family connections at the school\u2026 \n\n\nIt was a lot of laughs and explaining. \n\nNo, not *the* RA, *an* RA, Nan! \n\nLol", "lol! Ra= resident advisor. It\u2019s a person who is an older college student or sometimes an older adult who lives on the floor of a dorm at a university and helps mediate the students and help with issues.  Definitely not the Ira.", "There is a pronunciation difference too - The Ra is pronounced like ra-ra-Rasputin while R.A. is pronounced like AreAy like the names of the letters.", "Thanks for the tip--I'm planning to visit Ireland next year, and the American media always uses the full IRA when it comes up in a news story. If somebody was talking about the RA and I could not figure it out from the context, I'd think they meant Resident Advisor!", "I have to admit, thought the same as you \ud83d\ude02 Joking aside, it shows how much it is ingrained in us. \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude44", "So glad you shared that with the class, Timmy.", "Yeah, Americans seem to have a tendency to forget this is a global forum. But I'm from the US, and I still have to Google things all the time!", "Umm I\u2019m the nut job? An 18 year old girl with multiple drunk men coming into her space?? Yes the cops will take that seriously. My husband is a cop and a father. He would 100% call the cops if drunk men were in my daughter\u2019s space", "Mine have never actually used it outside of slumber parties when they were little. But they also have always made sure I know where they are and who they're with, and never blocked me from location settings on their phones, even if they knew I wouldn't love what they're doing. I trusted them to call me if it got unsafe. And I never caught them in a big lie either. \n\nSuper strict parenting doesn't always lead to *good* kids, and it almost always leads to *sneaky* kids.", "I've always told my kids I'd report them for murder. But that I'd still pick them up and drive them to turn themselves in, and I'd visit them and make sure they had money in their account. Lmao", "Ah, fair enough. Every day is a school (or college) day.", "And this is exactly the kind of issue they are supposed to help with.", "Honestly, if that subject crops up, you'd be best to make your excuses and leave. The only people who are still involved in that business don't have many supporters at all. Everybody else would prefer to focus on the positives these days.\n\nIf you want to, talk about the Ireland rugby team, GAA football and hurling, music, theatre, the ridiculous price of hotel rooms in Dublin, and where to get a decent, reasonably priced pint.

Granted it was the 40s and 50s, but it was still going to apply in the 80s.", "Thank you! If it comes up, I will make my polite goodbyes and get going. I'm old enough to remember The Troubles--they always got extensive coverage on the news because there are so many Americans who are of Irish descent (like myself.)\n\nWill study to make sure I can hold a conversation about the other subjects."]}
