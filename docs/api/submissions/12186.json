They hated their job and lacked stability in it. Though I also hate my job, it is pretty stable. Their hours and location were inconvenient for the entire household. A messy house stresses me out, and my job drained me to the point that I couldn't clean. Their job caused them physical pain and mental drain as well, so the house was usually extremely untidy.\n\nWe decided they would quit their job, at least until something closer and more stable opened up. In the meantime, they would be responsible for the majority of the cleaning and for most of the cooking. \n\nThe difference in both of our moods and mental health was immediately noticeable. \n\nI got to work in a clean environment without having to dedicate my \"free time\" to cleaning. We got to spend more time together. They weren't in pain anymore and I was less stressed.\n\nBut this only worked for us because we both wanted it. I needed more help in the house. They needed a break from work, not just from that specific job (evidenced by having switched jobs without much improvement) to avoid burnout.\n\nIf you don't want your husband to quit his job, if it isn't a decision that would benefit both of you, if it would cause unnecessary financial or mental burden on you, then you are not the AH for saying so. \n\nIf he\u2019s very insistent, then my recommendation would be that he takes a sabbatical and you see if he can handle the housework and if it actually makes him happier.", "NTA.

You don't do a single thing around the house. \n\nBefore he takes that vacation time, he needs to come up with a list of all the things he will be taking care of.

But if it was just a regular bottle of Olay, I'd say writing the exact product on the shopping list would be your responsibility. Just an example.)\n\nBecause if he wants to be a house-husband with no children to take care of, then he has to do it ALL because that it his new job. \n\nSince its a trial run to prove he could actually do it, he doesn't get to spend time relaxing until all the work is done.  And if he needs you to come up with a list of things for him to do, then his isn't ready to be a house-husband.  \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't mind having someone take care of the house if I could afford it and it meant everything was taken care of (not just the laundry, but doing the taxes, the weeding, the pantry organized, the garage organized, not having to come up with the grocery list, not having to remember everyone's birthdays, making all the appointments, handling the furnace inspections, making sure the car tabs are up-to-date, ordering and picking up prescriptions, etc, etc)  \n\nIf he wants to be a house-husband, he needs to show how it benefits BOTH of you.", "I'd divorce this dude before he quits and ends up entitled to more money from you.
