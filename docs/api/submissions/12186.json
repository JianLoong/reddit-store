They hated their job and lacked stability in it. Though I also hate my job, it is pretty stable. Their hours and location were inconvenient for the entire household. A messy house stresses me out, and my job drained me to the point that I couldn't clean. Their job caused them physical pain and mental drain as well, so the house was usually extremely untidy.\n\nWe decided they would quit their job, at least until something closer and more stable opened up. In the meantime, they would be responsible for the majority of the cleaning and for most of the cooking. \n\nThe difference in both of our moods and mental health was immediately noticeable. \n\nI got to work in a clean environment without having to dedicate my \"free time\" to cleaning. We got to spend more time together. They weren't in pain anymore and I was less stressed.\n\nBut this only worked for us because we both wanted it. I needed more help in the house. They needed a break from work, not just from that specific job (evidenced by having switched jobs without much improvement) to avoid burnout.\n\nIf you don't want your husband to quit his job, if it isn't a decision that would benefit both of you, if it would cause unnecessary financial or mental burden on you, then you are not the AH for saying so. \n\nIf he\u2019s very insistent, then my recommendation would be that he takes a sabbatical and you see if he can handle the housework and if it actually makes him happier.", "NTA.

You don't do a single thing around the house. \n\nBefore he takes that vacation time, he needs to come up with a list of all the things he will be taking care of.

But if it was just a regular bottle of Olay, I'd say writing the exact product on the shopping list would be your responsibility. Just an example.)\n\nBecause if he wants to be a house-husband with no children to take care of, then he has to do it ALL because that it his new job. \n\nSince its a trial run to prove he could actually do it, he doesn't get to spend time relaxing until all the work is done.  And if he needs you to come up with a list of things for him to do, then his isn't ready to be a house-husband.  \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't mind having someone take care of the house if I could afford it and it meant everything was taken care of (not just the laundry, but doing the taxes, the weeding, the pantry organized, the garage organized, not having to come up with the grocery list, not having to remember everyone's birthdays, making all the appointments, handling the furnace inspections, making sure the car tabs are up-to-date, ordering and picking up prescriptions, etc, etc)  \n\nIf he wants to be a house-husband, he needs to show how it benefits BOTH of you.", "I'd divorce this dude before he quits and ends up entitled to more money from you.

It makes sense in some situations when childcare is introduced to save money, but otherwise sounds like laziness. I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d fill up 40 hours per week cleaning and cooking. And then the huge hit to your income. What about his retirement account? Savings?", "NTA. Girl, run! \n\nFind yourself someone who's dream isn't for you to struggle while he pursues his \"happiness\". Money doesn't matter to him because he's counting on you to provide it. Watch the birth control because the minute he thinks you are trapped, he's going to quit his job.\n\nIf he really wants to quit, you should spend the next 2-3 years pretending to live on just your salary while saving the equivalent of his. Still split bills 50/50, but save the equivalent of 50% of his paycheck each in your own accounts. That way you can see how feasible living on one paycheck is while saving a large cash cushion for the transition.", "NTA and for the love of god, don't have kids with him, he doesn't do shit to pull his weight at home now, that's not going to change just because you have a kid.", "NTA\n\nPlease do not reproduce with this man. You'll be raising the children, doing the housework, and footing the bills. If he can't get himself together, you may need to take drastic measures.", "YTA.  I don't see anywhere her where you're actually addressing what seems to be burnout and/or depression.  Or so much as acknowledging his obvious struggles, but instead, subtly insulting him.\n\n> If he was a true house husband doing everything in the house that might be ok, but as I do the majority of housework at the moment, I'm doubtful he'd pick up everything and it might end up me working and coming home to housework like I do right now.\n\nYou're \"doubtful\" he'd do what he said he'd do.  Lovely.\n\nIf this were gender-reversed, everybody would be jumping down your throat for being an uncaring husband who was too blind to see his wife's obvious mental health struggles.  For being a terrible partner.\n\nInstead, I see wall-to-wall NTAs, and 'don't have children with him' and 'run.'  Because as a man, the moment he shows any weakness or admits to any issue, he's obviously unfit to be a man, let alone a partner or a father.", "If money isn\u2019t that important to him then why does he need half of OP\u2019s to be happy?", " NTA - I\u2019d be VERY surprised if he doesn\u2019t get \u201claid off\u201d in the next 6 months.", "Do not have children with him. Full stop.", "As a SAHM, I very much look forward to going back to work, lol. I have a 3 year old and newborn. I won't go back until my baby is 5 and in school. My husband wanted me to continue to stay home and just be a housewife. I was like hell no. I HATE cooking and cleaning with a passion. I would rather work and have the money to pay someone else to clean my house, lol. I love being home with the kiddos, but once they are in school there is no reason for me to be home all day", "So true, but he can still just pretend to get fired", "Hahahaha. You think he's going to do housework. Hahahaha", "Which would leave you paying all the bills and doing all the housework. And what exactly would he be contributing?", "Staying at home and cleaning caring for the children is hard work too and more than the normal work hours", "Me three. I'm currently looking for a job but not finding one.", "I don't think you meant to reply to me for several reasons beyond the fact that your comment is a non-sequiter, like the fact that I am a straight man.", "I switched jobs and had a three week break in between and by day 13 I\u2019m sitting there going \u201cI am so bored. I am grateful I have this break but I am so bored\u201d. I prefer to be working because it gives me structure. Like I have to be online for my 9am call. So I am awake by nine. I can\u2019t imagine just chilling not doing a single thing with my life."]}
