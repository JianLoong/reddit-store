I hope EX and her parents can work something out.", "Yeah but like does she still live with her parents? Why does she think she's unfit to have a kid? Why does she keep calling it my baby while she wants to give it away? Why do her parents hate her ex? Why is he her ex? Is he fit to be a father? So many questions", "What is best for the baby is to have a parent that actually wants to raise it.\nEnd of story.\nShe gets to decide whether she wants to be a mother or not, which she has.\nThe baby is not going to be raised by wolves in a cave, it is going to be raised by its father.\n\nGet off your lofty equine, families come in many different configurations nowadays and the kids are fine.", "My mom did that to me and now she doesn\u2019t see my kids at all", "My brother just had a long battle with his ex\u2019s parents over their rights and he lost.\n\nThey get my nephew once a month every weekend, plus a Christmas, thanksgiving, spring break holiday, weeks out of the summer.\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous. Grandparents right are portrayed as a boogie man because they\u2019re a really shitty thing to do to a parent, it undermines a parents right to decide who is around their kid.", "NTA Has nobody mentioned how difficult it would be for you to give up your parental rights and yet see your bio child at the bio grandparent\u2019s house?", "I feel like there's so much information missing here.", "INFO: Do you mind telling us how you and your ex came to this agreement?", "NTA - This is exactly what they should be doing since you are signing over rights at birth for the child to be with their other parent. \n\nThat being said,  your parents' behavior is very concerning. I say this as someone who has dealt with being sued for grandparent's rights, and having been caught up in the family court system for years in contentious litigation due to a toxic family. I am now thankfully out of the court system but remain active in the grandparent's rights groups online to provide advice and support to those who are going through what I went through 17 years ago.\n\nTheir behavior now is a *potential* red flag for trying for grandparents' rights later. They may accept the situation after it happened and managed their grief (and it's understandable that they will feel grief if they aren't able to establish a relationship when they want one). But sometimes people choose to attempt to use the courts to force the relationship, regardless of how possible it is in their state, in the hopes that they get a sympathetic judge.  And in many states, it's a very real possibility that visitation could be granted to your parents. \n\nI have no idea how you feel about that.  Nor do I know how your Ex feels about that.  If your Ex doesn't want any sort of visitation,  then if they choose the legal route it could get messy.  And as much as I'm guessing you don't want to be involved,  they will probably try to involve you to take a side and either support their claim to have visitation or to show cause that your parents aren't fit for visitation. You could be subpoenaed by either side. It sucks. Family court sucks. My advice is to ALWAYS try to resolve things outside of court if possible. \n\nWhat you told your parents is correct and you're NTA. But now you will need to be on guard in case they start talking about grandparent's rights or visitation through court. If they do, it would be a courtesy to let your Ex know in advance so they can start preparing legally for the fight ahead. And you'll need to decide which side you'll support.  Because it's going to court, there are no neutral third parties anymore. \n\nI'm sorry your parents aren't listening. Mine didn't either. I ended up having to go to No Contact with them eventually. I'm not saying that is where you'll end up. But they aren't respectful of your boundaries right now, and if that escalates, you'll have to decide how much you'll tolerate before enough is enough.", "Ah but it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to raise a child you don\u2019t feel capable of raising/ wouldn\u2019t give your all to? \n\nIf they truly want to interact with the baby, they\u2019ll get over it and stop making it about themselves.

Here that call to a lawyer will get your ex an earful of laughter... here, its viewed exactly the same as if you put the kid up for adoption.", "See that's why this thing called therapy exists. Why didn't your friends other family take them to see a therapist. That would have helped her navigate it and see it's not her fault and some people just aren't fit/don't want to be parents. It doesn't mean something is wrong with you. All kids thatbsre adopted or have a parent that isn't in their life should be taken to therapy and if you don't you're part of the blame for the trauma following them throughout their lives.", "Honestly, I don't think it's a good idea for them to be at the hospital anyway. Nor to even know which hospital she's at. Until and unless something goes wrong with the pregnancy there's no reason for them to be around to meet or see a grandchild they've already demonstrated an unhealthy ownership mentality toward before its even born and with the full knowledge that grandchild never is going to be \"theirs\".", "That seems wacky.

My friend lived on a plot of land with her side of the family, so they were very close knit and all of the grandkids were together daily.

I don't think anywhere but America has access to the internet. /s", "sounds extremely fair", "Doesn't sound likely after what OP's dad said.", "I never said at anytime she should raise it, I just said that\u2019s very sad for the child. We\u2019re talking about the grandparents. They want to be involved, if the mother is completely abditcating her role, she doesn\u2019t have to leave all decency out and not facilitate a mutual agreement between the grandparents and the father. Again, its about THE BABY. Her post sounds completely without any care for this human she\u2019s bringing into the world.\n\nAlso, the statistics don\u2019t lie. Kids who grow up without a mother or without a father, who lack love and support, suffer mental health issues, have criminal backgrounds ect\u2026 When you start a life, it\u2019s your job to help them succeed in whatever way you can. she\u2019s chosen not to do that job, but the grandparents can be someone in that child\u2019s life.  its not just a baby, they have a whole life of growth.", "I hope you're against adoption then.", "Yes but if OP doesn't have custody of the child, then it's OP's ex that they will be dealing with - as she has already pointed out to them", "This shocks me! One of my friends lived on a plot of land with her family. Her mom and brother and sister all have houses on this land and they were an incredibly close and loving family. She passed in a car accident and her two kids went to live with their father. Their grandmother went to the courts for visitation because he refused to let the kids see that side of the family. \n\nShe was awarded 24 hours a month.

Big yikes, I do not envy you right now. I had to take back my mom's emergency keys to my place because she kept letting herself in to see my cats without my knowledge, can't imagine the insanity that would ensue with a little human. \nGet it in writing, and hopefully you've already communicated with your ex that this could get ugly.

Do you want to keep your baby? Would you be willing to keep your baby if your parents support you?", "NTA but I would just like to remind you that even if you've already signed papers, you still have a few days after the birth to change your mind on things.

You need to do one of those two things. Speak to a lawyer with neither of your parents present and really understand your options, responsibilities, etc.", "Have you told ex what is happening?

Just get everything done by a lawyer and in writing. \n\nIt's wild that a lot of folks here think that if you legally sign away your parental rights, you'd still have to pay child support. Nope.
