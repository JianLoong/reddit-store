What did he do?", "NTA. \n\nYou are simply being honest and trying to remind them that it won't be up to you whether they have access to the child. It is not your fault they refuse to listen.", "This whole thing is\u2026odd. But if they supported your choice from the start it seems strange for them to pivot now. Ultimately if you want to give up your parental rights that is your choice and your choice alone. It\u2019s hard to tell who TA is without the whole story but they aren\u2019t entitled to your offspring, and if they are legally then they can choose to go that route if they see fit to do so. It shouldn\u2019t involve you if it gets to that point since you\u2019ve relinquished your rights.", "NTA, OP!\n\nTalk about shooting yourself in the foot, or cutting off your nose to spite your face! If your parents REALLY want to be barred from seeing their grandson, all they have to do is go right on referring to his father as \"that bastard\". Way to go, Grandma and Grandpa - NOT!", "NTA. Your parents need to start thinking of you as a surrogate or egg donor. They, technically, will have a biological grandchild, but that doesn't mean they'll have access to this kid.", "NTA. \n\nAre they offering to adopt instead? \n\nOoor are they trying to guilt you into keeping the baby and then just getting him for all the food moments and bouncing on the hard ones?", "NTA but see a lawyer, get the agreement to give your baby to your ex permanently in writing. \n\nAnd move out of town before your parents start making your life and your exes life hell.", "NTA", "They don't believe you'll give up the baby.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - You made your decision and they need to accept that and do exactly what you told them. The only alternative is lying to them or being in communication with your ex on their behalf for eternity. \n\nThis should not be a surprise to your parents. Unfortunately, it sounds like they thought your maternal instincts would kick in, and were supporting you initially because it felt right at the time and didn't process how it would impact their relationship with the baby. They probably never believed you would go through with it. \n\nYou gave them plenty of time to process the fact you are not raising this child, but they didn't because they believed and continue to believe something different will happen, something that has no basis in reality. The time is approaching that they will have to swallow their pride, and they need to do that on their own. The only thing you can do is reinforce reality with them, warn your ex and get the advice of an attorney.\n\nYour sister is an even bigger AH. Her position boils down to you goaded them because you gave them a practical response that they didn't want to hear. Like does she think you got pregnant to goad them? That you aren't conforming to their beliefs to goad them? Does she think you should have lied to them and gotten their hopes up only to hand custody to your ex anyway? Cause that would actually be goading them into thinking they can play grandparent to this child without ever speaking to your ex. They are goading you by building a whole nursery and acting like they have guaranteed visitation with overnight stays.\n\nYour sister should not be mad at you just because your parents don't like a decision you made. She can lend a sympathetic ear to them, but she should be backing you up and encouraging them to develop a relationship with your ex if they really want to know this child and be involved. If she hasn't already, she will at some point make a decision they don't like. She should be mindful of what sort of support she would like to have in that situation and mirror that. Unless she has too much pride as well. \n\nI am sorry you are receiving so many \"are you sure?\" and judgments about your decision as opposed to the question you literally asked. If you were the dad, you would not be getting that response.", "OP, I'm not sure you need to actually do anything. after the baby is born and your parents want to have him for a visit, just ignore them. you already told them where the baby will be living. leave it at that and drop it. don't respond (texted or asked) to any questions about the baby. period. end of. \n\nsome people just don't listen and in this case, silence will speak louder than words.", "From where I am sitting, you be the ass. From your seat, you are NTA.\n\nHowever, do you mean to say that you have given up your child to your X legally? If so, this means that you are the birth mother in name only and you give up all parental rights to your child including seeing said child and in any way raising said child, among other rights. You essentially do not give a damn about the child except that somehow and by someone have been convinced to bear the child instead of getting an abortion. Thank you for that, although you could travel to Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Abortion Capitol of these United States of America to get it done even in the waning weeks before birth... So, it doesn't surprise me that you wouldn't lift a finger to speak with the future father but to be so selfish as to not try is a testament to the hatred you have for yourself for having gotten pregnant, to begin with.\n\nIt also sounds like you are living at home with your parents? Maybe I misread that, but how are you going to prevent anyone from doing anything with or for a child which you gave up? You have no say in it whatsoever. How your family spends their time with an infant who, besides coming out of your body and is their flesh and blood, is none of your business.\n\nYour parents were with you and now they are going to do everything they can to have their grandchild in their life in spite of you. Good going...but, you have every right to do what you are doing.", "INFO: Is your ex fit to be a father? Is he ready for this?", "ESH.  You realize you may be paying child support, right?", "Doesn't sound like OP would contest grandparents' rights since she'll be signing her own rights away. The problem is grandparents trying to force parental rights on someone who doesn't want them. yes, she'll need to make sure everything terminating her rights is signed and legal, but their desire to see their bio grandson is daddy's problem only.\n\nNTA, OP. You've tried to disillusion them -- if they refuse to move on from Denial, it's not on you. You can now ignore them and proceed with your plan.", "If OP gives up her parental rights, then grandparents rights should be non-existent.\n\nGenerally grandparents rights only apply when either a parent dies, deported, deployed or incarcerated. Then the parents of the deceased/absent parent can ask for grandparents rights. They are generally only granted when it is in the best interest of the child. Rarely will grandparents win when their child cuts them off/goes LC/NC contact.", "She should also probably stop referring to the baby as \"my son\" or \"our son\" as soon as possible. Continuing to do so is likely confusing the parents into thinking that some part of her sees this baby as hers and would like to keep and raise him. The sooner she starts explaining that this baby is going to be her ex's son, and his son only, and that she is not going to be co-parenting or acting as his mother in any meaningful way going forward, the easier it will be for her parents to comprehend. \n\n\"He's not my son. I am giving birth to him, yes, but \\[ex's name\\] will be his only custodial parent. I will not be involved in raising him. I will not be his mother.\"  They need this to be made explicitly clear to them.", "You can waive your rights, but not the financial obligation.", "This is exactly what I posted elsewhere. Better to start making that boundary clear as soon as possible. If OP is not going to be this child's mother, she should stop referring to him as \"our son\" and \"my son\". It's likely confusing her parents into thinking that she has maternal feelings towards him. She should be explaining that he is \"\\[ex's\\] son\", not hers, and that she is not going to be co-parenting at all and will have no relationship with this child.", "I know right? She acts like that's an everyday situation she is in that we can blindly judge. I know very few mothers who give away their children. I am not saying that's the wrong thing to do in every situation, I am asking what the situation is.", "Facts. And how she keeps saying \u201cour baby\u201d like first of all your a surrogate at this point. Not a mother. Infact if she\u2019s any type of mother it\u2019s the deadbeat type. Anyone who considers their self to me a mother just because they birthed a child they have no intentions on raising is simply a lunatic.", "Somebody doesn\u2019t spend their time lurking in the justnomil sub and it shows!", "In the UK grandparents who have an existing relationship with a child and who haven't done something to merit severing that relationship can pursue grandparents rights in order to maintain visitation. In the UK at least it's about the child and what's best for them so the child's wishes and well being will be what's taken into account when deciding. Here its more about the child's right to continue having grandparents if their parents and grandparents fall out or one parent dies and the survivor tries to cut the other's family off etc.", "I think it depends on circumstances and location. Regardless, get it in writing asap", "My grandmother did this to my aunt who had medical issues.  Even before my aunt passed away, my grandparents were raising her as their youngest child. With other teenagers/young adults treating her like a baby sibling and being generally toxic, she never had space to grieve or adequate support as a kid. She believes she would have had a better life if she had been adopted as her mother originally wanted.", "I knew a couple who missed out on the baby they agreed to adopt because it was born with special needs and the single teen mom just couldn't bear to let it go. They stayed in contact but they were heartbroken.", "I mean honestly you post a wild story like this, make zero comments on your own thread, and it all feels pretty sus.", "Exactly right, every one of these laws allows for judge discretion, and some judges like exercising that discretion.", "\nThis seems to give them little hope that he will remain in his sons' lives", "Without a doubt that is a outlier, but still very scary."]}
