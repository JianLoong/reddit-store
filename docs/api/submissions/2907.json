Or death???? C) Again death exists. Abusive people exist. Mentally unwell/unstable people exist.\n What's best for a child is that they have a HAPPY and LOVING life. A life where they are wanted and appreciated. I'd also love your input on whether formula or drug contained breast milk is better for a baby. Is a horribly violent abusive father better than no father? Is a sexually abusive grandparent better than no grandparent? Is an addict mother or father better than none. Is abuse and neglect better than a single parent home? If I had two parents I would've been physically abused, threatened, and probably trafficked knowing my father. You have no idea about anything except your little bubble where everything is perfect and nothing could ever possibly be bad. It's nice you get to live in your own bubble and ignore every shitty thing in the world. Like last year I think an 8 month old baby girl died because her BIOLOGICAL FATHER r*ped her.
