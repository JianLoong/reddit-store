Also, according to your other comments, you don't use this bathroom and the mess is all his. He's being extremely lazy and immature.\n\nYou guys need to sit down and have a serious conversation about this and maybe think about if this is who you want to spend the rest of your life with. Just because he makes more money than you doesn't mean you should do 100% of the cleaning. I cannot believe you agreed to that, what kind of bullshit is that?", "You're NTA. \n\nHe's a solid AH for not doing any housework. I don't care if he works longer hours. That doesn't make him helpless outside of those hours, any more than you are. And if your work hours increased, do you really think he'd step up? \n\nThis goes way beyond a bathroom remodel, friend.

How is it even possible to clean the bathroom in the current condition.", "You're ultimately only screwing yourself and your own home.", "nta but you're both kinda childish, help him remodel the bathroom, have him help you clean the bathroom? Why is that so hard ?", "NTA\n\nHe's lazy and immature", "Ring around the toilet, dust on the floor. But the filthy part is because he has continued to throw stuff into the garbage can until it has overflowed and now there is a pile around the garbage can because he continues throwing stuff into the corner and I refuse to take the garbage out. So it is mostly his mess.\n\nHe uses the half finished one to shower. I use that one only at night when I'm upstairs in our room, otherwise I only use the downstairs bathroom.", "Up front we agreed on inside chores being mine and outside chores being his. Thought it sounded fair at the time but since then he has done less and less and it has just kind of evolved into me doing everything. And since he's gotten away with it for 5 years he isn't going to change. Hence why I put up the bathroom ultimatum. If he does nothing else he could at least finish a project he started.", "Agree. NTA. I\u2019d have contacted a contractor a long  time ago.", "We both work full time jobs but he makes considerably more than I do so according to him cleaning is solely my job.

Really, this issue is bigger than a bathroom. Your options aren\u2019t living in filth or being a maid.

I do 100% of laundry, dishes, cleaning, child care, etc.\n\nGood to know. By this logic, I shouldn't be doing anything in the house either. I'll let my husband know ;).\n\nNo but really. Who does what in the house is not about who earns how much, but who spends how much time working. If you both work equally, you should both do the same in the household.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: We have an entire TV show for this in the Netherlands.
