In my eyes she is just as bad as the teachers who are doing the bullying.\n\nI don't care if she is scared of retaliation from the two teachers, if this happened in front of her in her class, imagine what it's like for that kid when he's alone in their classroom. That's blatant child abuse!\n\nWhat a gross individual you're dating. If I were you I would dump her and then report all of them. People like that don't need to be around children, period.", "NTA.

Your girlfriend and her colleagues are trusted with this child\u2019s well-being, and their treatment of this kid says more about them than the child. \n\nNTA - but be careful that this isn\u2019t part of a larger pattern of problematic behavior on the part of your GF.", "NTA. This kid is in kindergarten. If your gf is scared of retaliation, you need to find a way to get the info to authorities.

Maybe if she tells someone her job could be at risk (some workplaces function like a mafia) but at least talk to the kid, reach out somehow. If she did nothing at all, even afterwards, then I understand your disappointment because that's straight up bullying, made even worse because the bullies are the authority.

Her lack of empathy is astounding and would disappoint me in a partner too", "Those other teachers are definitely dicks. I can understand d not liking a particular student but to single them out like that is straight up bullying. Your girlfriend is in a tough spot though because she may be worried about how to handle such a situation. She might me worried about things like them retaliating against her if she says anything about how they acted as they've already proven to be bullies. I'd say try not to be overly upset with your girlfriend about this.", "NAH, other than those teachers. \n\nI get what you're saying, it wasn't right for her to not do anything at that moment. But maybe that wouldn't have been the most effective or helpful for that kid- I don't know what the dynamics are at her school.
