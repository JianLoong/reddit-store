He was a crappy dad and husband in the past because of decisions he made.  He made this bed and now he has to lie in it.  I don't blame you for asking because it seems you like Jane and don't want to see her strung along like your mom, and what your seeing him to do indicates he may be based on his past actions.  It's not like you're pulling this stuff out of the blue.  The fact he's as defensive as he is is another red flag that you're likely correct.", "NTA.  He has no reason to smell like \"various perfumes\" and isn't giving straight answers as to why he was late.  It's OK for you to ask, especially given his history.\n\nIf he is using you as an excuse to meet up with other women before/after, then he's cheating on both of you.", "NTA. It's a fair question given his past, and the disgusting way he behaves around other women. It's on him to fix it, and you have a right to look out for your stepmother.\n\nAlso, I know it isn't funny, but I couldn't help but laugh at the terribly awkward picture of a man trying to bond with his openly gay son about attractive women.\n\n\"Check out the rack on that waitress, son. Really something, eh?\"\n\n*Yeah, dad. Those sweater kittens really rev my engine. I love hanging out like this, one man openly ogling women who aren't his wife, and the other not even liking women.

I know you are close to your stepmom, but she\u2019s a grown woman who should know who she married. She probably knows that he cheated a lot in the past. So him cheating now is a reasonable expectation. Unless you have proof or witnessed it, I would stay out of their relationship. This is something she needs to come to terms with on her own. If he is cheating on her (which I\u2019m sure he is) then she will need support once it comes to light. You have to manage your relationship with your father, not your father\u2019s marriages.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I read this aloud and both me and my family agree that he's probably upset because he's been caught. I'd say try to bring this up with Jane in a nice gentle way as this will affect her the most. Treat her to a nice girls day too while you're at it to show that you're here for her", "NTA: He has had a history of cheating, and had the audacity to flirt and stare with other women, as well as smell like different perfumes. There is nothing wrong with suspecting him of cheating; you are only protecting Jane.", "He's late for your dates and evasive if that gets mentioned around Jane...that says it all BUT I don't think it's your place to tell her. I would hope she knows his past relationship history and if she's paying attention she knows something is not right. If you're upset with his behavior lessen contact with him it does no mean you have to lessen it with Jane. YWBTA if you told her but YNTA for confronting him.", "That is a very funny picture, but I\u2019m a woman so it kind of does make sense in a gross way.", "It is not the responsibility of the daughter to be the morality police for her Dad. I agree with you fully, Jane is an adult and so is her dad. Any conversation around this should have taken place privately and intentionally, not just blurted out due to old feelings being projected onto him. What you did was find your dad guilty without evidence and tried blowing up his marriage because you purposely wanted to embarrass and shame him. Revenge always sounds great on paper, but the joy seldom lasts long and your actions say way more about you than the person (who you have zero evidence he really is cheating), than your father. Hunches or \u201cfeelings\u201d are not facts\u2026YTA. Period."]}
