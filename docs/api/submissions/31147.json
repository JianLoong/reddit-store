We've been considered middle-class, doing things others werent  as privileged to do such as buying our daughter a car on her 16th birthday.   \n\n\nI come from a family of immigrants and was considered in poverty growing up, after learning about the bullying i was furious as we thought we didnt raise her to behave that way. She was in honors and top ranking of her class.   \n\n\nI tried to talk to our daughter over why she would do that and i was disturbed to learn it was because she viewed that girl as \"trailer trash\" which irrated me. The girl from what i learned is very smart and works hard, she bought her own beater car buy herself and works 2 jobs. She considered the money our family had as our families money, so i put her in her place and told her that it was not her money but her mom and I's money.    \n\n\nI decided from that point i was spoiling my daughter too much, we ended up taking away her latest iphone and replacing it with my old iphone 8 (by switching phones with me) with a talk and text plan . We took away her family credit car,sold her car, along with her macbook and other luxuries.  \n\n\nI also told her should would have to find a job without neopotism and work a minimum wage job like everyone else her age, because i'm done giving her handouts if shes gonna act entitled.   \n\n\nFast forward 2 months later, she is working at a fast food resturant with us driving her around. She doesnt talk to me unless she needs something like a ride but is very upset with me.  \n\n\nMy wife feels like i am taking this too far because its affecting her social status and grades and school I however feel like she needs to be humbled because i cant have a daughter who will disrespect people just because the amount of money they have. I also feel that her behaving this way will affect her younger sister (f12) and how she precieves the world.   \n\n\nAITA for punishing my 16-year-old step-daughter after we found out she was bullying a kid for being poor?\n\nEdit:\n\nI also like to add, we took away her MacBook but she still has access to the family computer in the house. Windows computer for school that is powerful (i7 and great gpu) and recently new \n\nShe still has wifi access at the house however we did throttle her speed because high speed internet is a privilege, she has fast enough internet to do homework and watch videos that aren\u2019t in HD like Netflix and stuff. \n\nShe also isn\u2019t failing, she went from a straight A student to mostly B\u2019s and 2 A\u2019s which I still find great.

You may just save her from that path to hell that she was on.  She acts very privileged and entitled from what you described.  It is good for her to see how the other half lives, I am sure it is very eye opening for her.  I would continue this path for at least a year, so she does not slide back. Hopefully, you will have a much more respectful and kind step daughter.  It really is too bad other parents don't do more stuff like this to their children, instead of spoiling them rotten and then wonder why they are in jail.  Good for you.", "NTA. It's important to teach your daughter the value of empathy and respect for others, regardless of their financial situation.

It may be tough for her now, but in the long run, this will help her become a better person.", "NTA, as for your wife, she needs to get a clue, taking away and selling her luxury items and making her work a typical teenage job is not affecting her grades.  Her grades come from the effort she puts in.  By dropping her grades she figured she could get the punishments to end.  I am sorry she was spoiled and entitled in the first place, but glad you took real issue with it.  In the end I hope these life lessons shape who she becomes.  Buckle up for at least a rocky year.", "NTA. She is facing consequences for her actions and learning a lesson at the same time.

I don't even see having luxuries taken away as a punishment lol. Like, she still has a phone! The only think I can see is maybe not selling her laptop, but I'm also betting she has access to another computer somewhere.

When she wants to buy stuff maybe she should get a job since she\u2019s poor", "NTA.\n\nThis is a good lesson.\n\nI do think that the job itself should be optional; if she wants anything besides basic necessities she needs to buy them herself.

Good parenting!", "NTA. You are a good dad. She was being an entitled B! Bully. She needs to learn to be humble. She just doesn't like loosing as her mother admitted, her \"status\". WTF. That's what made her think she could bully others. She is the \"mean girl\". Personally, I'm glad you put her in her place.", "NTA. Class is not something that is reserved for what your socioeconomics status is. What many minors think is that their parents money, is their money. \n \nYou are combating her entitlement. She is not allowed to disrespect others because they come from a poorer background. It\u2019s the equivalent, if the prom queen is super rich, bashes her because she\u2019s middle-class.. it\u2019s not OK and she needs to learn", "Awww well doesn\u2019t this just tick nearly every box, almost like a near-perfect karma troll.", "NTA\nBut you should think about this situation more. Like, where is the end of this? How you will understand that she learned enough? How you will deal with her sister when she will ask for the car? Will you downgrade her life as well? Will she blame her sister for it? Punishment is not enough. As far as I can see - she doesn't feel any  remorse and your relationship is damaged. Your wife is tired of the situation,and wants to fix it somehow,and I get why. \nTry to find a therapist maybe? Because this is a dead end, and situation is frozen, not healed.\n\nBy the time way. Take some responsibility, you spoiled her, it's your fault as well. What is your punishment?", "Definitely NTA. Good work m8. This is exactly the lesson your daughter needed to learn if she was harboring in herself that level of entitlement. What you're doing is teaching her an essential lesson about the reality of the world at a time where she's about to face it soon on her own. \n\nShe's bound to lash out at first since she was so entitled, but when she internalizes it and reflects on it over time; she'll come away with a bigger appreciation of you, your wife and less fortunate people and be much more prepared for the world at large because you were willing to step up.\n\nGood work.", "NTA stick with it.", "NTA she wont learn anything if you just give her her privileges back", "NTA. That's just tough love.", "NTA I think you did the right thing, especially having her go get a different job on her own.

Oh well, you're still mad at her for being a bully.", "Info: Why did her grades drop so much? Does she have to work a lot of hours?", "Regarding how work is affecting her social status - wtfc!\n\nRegarding her need to be humbled. Agreed as long as your not being a dick about it. Every action on your part should be for her own good. \n\nRegarding \u201cI can\u2019t have a daughter who will disrespect people\u2026\u201d as long as the lessons are about her growth and not your image. \n\nThere is a difference between punishment and lessons. By now the punishments should be over. Lessons might continue until she has learned. How will you know when she has learned?\n\nBest wishes to all of you.", "NTA - She doesn't get to torment other's and complain then complain when she becomes slightly less privileged than she was", "NTA. I think this is exactly what she needs. She apparently thought she was entitled to look down on someone because that someone didn't have all of the perks and privileges she had. Time for her to learn how the other half lives.", "NTA this is an extremely reasonable and fair punishment. If she wants to mock poverty then she should live it. You took away luxuries no necessities so she\u2019s not even living actual poverty. Stand your ground this is a good lesson for her to learn", "You say you didn't raise her to be a bully.  But you did. You handed her everything for nothing.\n\nIn the lo g run, earning her own way will pay off for her", "NTA.

(Not literal crime, it\u2019s just a phrase)", "NTA. However, she needs to apologize to the student she was bullying. Life isn\u2019t about things and how many things you have. It\u2019s about kindness to others. So, it\u2019s not enough to take stuff away from her. You need to hold her accountable. \n\nAnd maybe do more volunteer work around your community with her.", "NTA. Anything else but the bullying is moot. You did absolutely the correct thing.\n\nThe lesson here is simply:\n\nDon't bully.\n\nAnd you have taught it well.", "NTA OP.  Your stepdaughter is lucky that she didn\u2019t grow up when I did, because back then there were far worse penalties for her kind of behavior than just taking away her iPhone and such.  At least she is learning that her entitlement comes with consequences, and I think that once things settle down, she\u2019ll probably appreciate the life lesson you\u2019re trying to teach her.", "NTA, and you have done a good thing.  I might have taken it a bit farther by taking away (or selling) her 'cool' clothes, leaving her with just enough clothing to get through.....say, 2 weeks.  Then make her wash her own clothes.

Now she just has one that is less desirable in her opinion. That isn't affecting her grades. Its a manipulation to get her cushy job, car and cc back. And it's obviously working on some people.", "You literally said \u201cminimum wage job \u201c. Perhaps you meant part-time job?", "Have you worked a minimum wage job in the last decade? It's absolute nonsense that working one of these jobs won't affect grades. These aren't easy jobs. Sometimes it's necessary to work one, but to pretend it has no effect on the worker is crazy.\n\nAnd I never said she should get her old job back. She never should have had it in the first place. I'm saying she should have easy transportation to her current job so she can get there and back without waiting for pickups. She needs time at home to do her homework or relax her mind to prepare for school.", "Minimum wage job describes the job, not just the wage. She's not working a cushy job in her dad's office. She's on her feet all shift in some pretty shitty conditions. That will absolutely affect her schoolwork.", "I worked at a grocery store and a fast food place while in high school. You can still make good grades covered grease while working a BK. Didn't have a car either. Amazingly still graduated with honors.", "Nah, a minimum wage job is the money they get paid, not a descriptor of the job. The descriptor of her job is a fast food employee. And you don't know that her job at her parents business is all that cushy.  I worked fast food when I was in high school and college. It wasn't that demanding. Millions of other kids have done it too.", "That was, what, the 80s?", "That is just YOU though. I had minimum wage jobs in high school and university and my grades, which were okay/good could have been a lot better without them! I had no choice though. The individuals who I know who had stellar grades didn't have minimum-wage jobs. She still should have a job, but I disagree that minimum wage jobs don't affect grades, especially if she is in AP/IB/dual enrollment, etc.", "Sounds like you just want to fight about semantics. I don't.", "Have they changed Burger King lol? Well actually more stuff is automated and you don't have to know how to count change. So it's easier. Your welcome.", "The commenter asked me if I had worked a minimum wage job (my guess to prove I didn't know what they were talking about) and I answered her.", "Semantics aside, her current job isn't really a hinderance to grades. She is still working regardless."]}
