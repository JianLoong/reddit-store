We've been considered middle-class, doing things others werent  as privileged to do such as buying our daughter a car on her 16th birthday.   \n\n\nI come from a family of immigrants and was considered in poverty growing up, after learning about the bullying i was furious as we thought we didnt raise her to behave that way. She was in honors and top ranking of her class.   \n\n\nI tried to talk to our daughter over why she would do that and i was disturbed to learn it was because she viewed that girl as \"trailer trash\" which irrated me. The girl from what i learned is very smart and works hard, she bought her own beater car buy herself and works 2 jobs. She considered the money our family had as our families money, so i put her in her place and told her that it was not her money but her mom and I's money.    \n\n\nI decided from that point i was spoiling my daughter too much, we ended up taking away her latest iphone and replacing it with my old iphone 8 (by switching phones with me) with a talk and text plan . We took away her family credit car,sold her car, along with her macbook and other luxuries.  \n\n\nI also told her should would have to find a job without neopotism and work a minimum wage job like everyone else her age, because i'm done giving her handouts if shes gonna act entitled.   \n\n\nFast forward 2 months later, she is working at a fast food resturant with us driving her around. She doesnt talk to me unless she needs something like a ride but is very upset with me.  \n\n\nMy wife feels like i am taking this too far because its affecting her social status and grades and school I however feel like she needs to be humbled because i cant have a daughter who will disrespect people just because the amount of money they have. I also feel that her behaving this way will affect her younger sister (f12) and how she precieves the world.   \n\n\nAITA for punishing my 16-year-old step-daughter after we found out she was bullying a kid for being poor?\n\nEdit:\n\nI also like to add, we took away her MacBook but she still has access to the family computer in the house. Windows computer for school that is powerful (i7 and great gpu) and recently new \n\nShe still has wifi access at the house however we did throttle her speed because high speed internet is a privilege, she has fast enough internet to do homework and watch videos that aren\u2019t in HD like Netflix and stuff. \n\nShe also isn\u2019t failing, she went from a straight A student to mostly B\u2019s and 2 A\u2019s which I still find great. \n\nEdit #2:\n\nThis blew up, I would like to clarify some things, yes we are upper-middle class, not multi-millionaires or anything like that but enough to live comfortably\n\nShe is practically my daughter as I\u2019ve raised her since she was practically 4 and her real father walked out on the family when she was 2, my wife helps runs the business and we both agree on punishments. We came to an agreement that I would make decisions with her on things.\n\nWe did talk with the family and had her apologize to the girl at school, she was required to do 5 hours of community service at the school (volunteering for food drives and after school activities) due to the schools no bully policy.\n\nWe also didn\u2019t force her to get a job, she wanted the job to get money so she could hang out with her friends, and buy things she wanted. We just cut her off from her $15/hr receptionist job for a non-nepotism job. We also warned her that if her grades become too unsustainable she would be forced to quit her job and focus on school because she doesn\u2019t need extracurricular activities outside of school she needs to focus on her education.", "created_utc": 1700242062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xk7iq/aita_for_punishing_my_16yearold_stepdaughter/", "score": 5756, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may just save her from that path to hell that she was on.  She acts very privileged and entitled from what you described.  It is good for her to see how the other half lives, I am sure it is very eye opening for her.  I would continue this path for at least a year, so she does not slide back. Hopefully, you will have a much more respectful and kind step daughter.  It really is too bad other parents don't do more stuff like this to their children, instead of spoiling them rotten and then wonder why they are in jail.  Good for you.", "NTA. It's important to teach your daughter the value of empathy and respect for others, regardless of their financial situation. By holding her accountable for her actions and making her experience the consequences of her behavior, you are teaching her a valuable life lesson. It may be tough for her now, but in the long run, this will help her become a better person.", "NTA, as for your wife, she needs to get a clue, taking away and selling her luxury items and making her work a typical teenage job is not affecting her grades.  Her grades come from the effort she puts in.  By dropping her grades she figured she could get the punishments to end.  I am sorry she was spoiled and entitled in the first place, but glad you took real issue with it.  In the end I hope these life lessons shape who she becomes.  Buckle up for at least a rocky year.", "NTA. She is facing consequences for her actions and learning a lesson at the same time. She was spoiled and entitled. \n\nYour wife is worried about the wrong thing (her social status), when she should be worried about whether or not she is sending a decent human being, who doesn't shame others for working hard, into the world.", "NTA. I don't even see having luxuries taken away as a punishment lol. Like, she still has a phone! The only think I can see is maybe not selling her laptop, but I'm also betting she has access to another computer somewhere. You're literally just trying to not raise a monster here", ">My wife feels like i am taking this too far because its affecting her social status\n\nIf her \u201csocial status\u201d is based on belittling those less fortunate, then fuck her social status.\n\nYou should also make her volunteer at a homeless shelter, or serving meals to the poor. Your daughter needs to learn empathy\u2026 and humility.", "NTA you should also explain to her that she\u2019s poor too. He parents might have money but that doesn\u2019t mean she does. When she wants to buy stuff maybe she should get a job since she\u2019s poor", "NTA.\n\nThis is a good lesson.\n\nI do think that the job itself should be optional; if she wants anything besides basic necessities she needs to buy them herself.

This is not just about punishment, it's about teaching your daughter an important life lesson. You're doing good.", "NTA Your daughter can have her old lifestyle any time. The girl she bullied cannot.

She got a minimum wage job like you wanted. The stuff she had is gone. But now her future is being affected and her grades are suffering.\n\nYou need a middle ground. Give her a reliable but not flashy car so she doesn't have to worry about driving to/from work. Pay for the car insurance and taxes, but have her pay for the gas, oil changes, and repairs. She doesn't need a MacBook, but she does need a good computer. She doesn't need the latest iPhone, but she does need a data plan.\n\nTbh, that's all you should have done in the first place. The family job, the flashy car and gadgets - those were all a huge mistake and never should have been given to her to begin with.", "If her social status was based solely on her belongings, her peers must not actually like her for herself all that much.\n\nNTA but if she has an attitude this shitty at her age, a few restrictions like you describe aren\u2019t going to magically fix it.

You are the father that every spoiled teenager needs.", "NTA! I'm a 16f, if I ever treated someone like that for something they can't control i'd fully embrace the consequences! Good parenting!", "NTA. You are a good dad. She was being an entitled B! Bully. She needs to learn to be humble. She just doesn't like loosing as her mother admitted, her \"status\". WTF. That's what made her think she could bully others. She is the \"mean girl\". Personally, I'm glad you put her in her place.", "NTA. Class is not something that is reserved for what your socioeconomics status is. What many minors think is that their parents money, is their money. \n \nYou are combating her entitlement. She is not allowed to disrespect others because they come from a poorer background. It\u2019s the equivalent, if the prom queen is super rich, bashes her because she\u2019s middle-class.. it\u2019s not OK and she needs to learn", "Awww well doesn\u2019t this just tick nearly every box, almost like a near-perfect karma troll.", "NTA\nBut you should think about this situation more. Like, where is the end of this? How you will understand that she learned enough? How you will deal with her sister when she will ask for the car? Will you downgrade her life as well? Will she blame her sister for it? Punishment is not enough. As far as I can see - she doesn't feel any  remorse and your relationship is damaged. Your wife is tired of the situation,and wants to fix it somehow,and I get why. \nTry to find a therapist maybe? Because this is a dead end, and situation is frozen, not healed.\n\nBy the time way. Take some responsibility, you spoiled her, it's your fault as well. What is your punishment?", "Definitely NTA. Good work m8. This is exactly the lesson your daughter needed to learn if she was harboring in herself that level of entitlement. What you're doing is teaching her an essential lesson about the reality of the world at a time where she's about to face it soon on her own. \n\nShe's bound to lash out at first since she was so entitled, but when she internalizes it and reflects on it over time; she'll come away with a bigger appreciation of you, your wife and less fortunate people and be much more prepared for the world at large because you were willing to step up.\n\nGood work.", "NTA stick with it.", "NTA she wont learn anything if you just give her her privileges back", "NTA. That's just tough love.", "NTA I think you did the right thing, especially having her go get a different job on her own.  It's a shame, some people can be grateful for their opportunities and luxuries, and others use their good fortune to hurt others.  Good for you for putting your foot down.  She's still mad at you?  Oh well, you're still mad at her for being a bully.", "Info: Why did her grades drop so much? Does she have to work a lot of hours?", "Regarding how work is affecting her social status - wtfc!\n\nRegarding her need to be humbled. Agreed as long as your not being a dick about it. Every action on your part should be for her own good. \n\nRegarding \u201cI can\u2019t have a daughter who will disrespect people\u2026\u201d as long as the lessons are about her growth and not your image. \n\nThere is a difference between punishment and lessons. By now the punishments should be over. Lessons might continue until she has learned. How will you know when she has learned?\n\nBest wishes to all of you.", "NTA - She doesn't get to torment other's and complain then complain when she becomes slightly less privileged than she was", "NTA. I think this is exactly what she needs. She apparently thought she was entitled to look down on someone because that someone didn't have all of the perks and privileges she had. Time for her to learn how the other half lives.", "NTA this is an extremely reasonable and fair punishment. If she wants to mock poverty then she should live it. You took away luxuries no necessities so she\u2019s not even living actual poverty. Stand your ground this is a good lesson for her to learn", "You say you didn't raise her to be a bully.  But you did. You handed her everything for nothing.\n\nIn the long run, earning her own way will pay off for her", "NTA.  Our son drove his car to the dealership to sell after the umpteenth time of not being where he was supposed to be and not answering his phone.", "NTA the punishment is appropriate for the crime. (Not literal crime, it\u2019s just a phrase)", "NTA. However, she needs to apologize to the student she was bullying. Life isn\u2019t about things and how many things you have. It\u2019s about kindness to others. So, it\u2019s not enough to take stuff away from her. You need to hold her accountable. \n\nAnd maybe do more volunteer work around your community with her.", "NTA. Anything else but the bullying is moot. You did absolutely the correct thing.\n\nThe lesson here is simply:\n\nDon't bully.\n\nAnd you have taught it well.", "NTA OP.  Your stepdaughter is lucky that she didn\u2019t grow up when I did, because back then there were far worse penalties for her kind of behavior than just taking away her iPhone and such.  At least she is learning that her entitlement comes with consequences, and I think that once things settle down, she\u2019ll probably appreciate the life lesson you\u2019re trying to teach her.", "NTA, and you have done a good thing.  I might have taken it a bit farther by taking away (or selling) her 'cool' clothes, leaving her with just enough clothing to get through.....say, 2 weeks.  Then make her wash her own clothes.   If she wants more clothes, that's what a thrift store is for.\n\nBut what do I know.  I've never been cool.   Or rich.\n\nYou might want to start a family tradition of volunteering at a shelter, too.  Not just her.  ALL of you.", "NTA. I am what is considered middle class in my country. I am 16 years old.

She needs to learn the value of hard work, of money, of struggle. But this is a predicament that you as a parent put her in. I understand it; you grew up in poverty and resolved to make sure your daughter did not have the same experiences of deprivation, so you gave her everything. This is a mistake that you made, and she is getting punished rather than taught out of the behaviour.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYour daughter was behaving monstrously, no doubt. And, because of your own experiences with poverty, you acted with a lot of emotion and went absolutely scorched earth, taking everything away from her that was important to her. Now, understandably, she resents you. So we're left in a situation where she's ostensibly learning the value of work, but actually just seems to be despising the whole ordeal, mitigating the lessons learned.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat needs to happen (and maybe this has but you just didnt mention it) is consistent conversations about wealth and privilege. Tell her about your experiences and the difficulty/struggle of poverty. Bring her to volunteer at a soup kitchen (not by forcing her, ideally, but as she understands more and more what you're trying to teach her; be more collaborative).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for her possessions, you absolutely should not have sold them. That is punishment based on anger and vindictiveness and she can feel it. Instead, you could have taken them and given her a payment plan to earn it back. Same with the car: payment plan. Can she afford the car on a payment plan? If not, time to downgrade. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHaving her work to earn these things teaches the value of hard work and money. Talking with her and sharing your experiences will teach her empathy (will be an uphill battle now that you've soured your relationship; you'll need to apologize and make it up to her while still maintaining the core message and plan for redemption). And bringing her to a place like a soup kitchen when she's ready, and not totally in resentment mode, will give her first had experiences to augment that empathy development.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn conclusion, your daughter was wrong for her behaviour, but your approach was far more punitive than it was about teaching and you need to examine how your own experiences influenced this in order to provide a proper apology. Children need boundaries, but going scorched earth by selling or taking away so much of what is important to her in one go is excessive (think of how an adult would feel if you did this; she feels the same way whether you think it's justified or not).

We volunteered to serve community lunch at least once a year and did an angel tree donation for a kid in foster care. My kids have always done this too as I think it\u2019s important. My family is in a position to help more of them, so that\u2019s what we do. I think my kids have had as much fun over the years picking out those gifts as they did opening their own.", "Then I'm not telling you anything that you don't already know. I'm still going to cheer you on, and you can't stop me! \n\nAll the best to you!", "In semi rural US here! It would've been incredibly difficult for me to get to school and extracurriculars without my own car. My parents driving me or arranging carpool rotations with others was actively hurting them due to the long schedules. I'd have to go to sports practices at 5am and then sometimes wouldn't be done with club meetings or practices till 9pm and that just wasn't feasible for them because they were both working. I also did a lot of dual enrollment or extra classes which required midday transport to nearby school/university and since it was an extra thing I did on my own, the school didn't offer transportation.\n\nI'm not saying everyone's schedule is like this, and I'm quite lucky to have been able to have my own car. I'm sure we would've made it work otherwise, but I also could see myself having to have dropped a lot of extracurriculars as a result.", "As another comment mentioned, the \u201cpoor\u201d girl the daughter was bullying managed to work 2 jobs and still have good grades, but daughter can\u2019t manage one real job? Hopefully this teaches the daughter respect for the less fortunate that work harder than the privileged for much less", "Given that the other girl was going through that and getting bullied for it, that sounds like an *excellent* lesson for OP's daughter.", "I feel you! I still miss it and i exchanged my SE for a 12 mini back then \ud83d\ude05 Also never want to go bigger \ud83d\ude29", "Being a tyrant isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere with the dog", "Seriously, this whole thread is insane. Her situation right now sounds to me like she's experiencing a completely *ordinary* childhood - like so many other kids. She's not living in poverty, there are no hardships for her, she is just living a completely normal life, neither rich or poor. The way people in this thread are talking about her it's as if she's been kicked out of the house and is living on the streets.\n\nShe was indeed stupidly spoiled before, but now she is just normal.", "No you probably did, you just justified it because the kid was an ass or something.\n\nIt is pretty clear everyone on this sub is just looking for an excuse to be mean to teenagers.\n\nAnyone bad action and you justify any level of retaliation.\n\nPeople here are cheering for the bullying of this child you don\u2019t know and have no details on her behavior.", "Why would it need to get that far before recognizing it\u2019s an issue? If his daughter genuinely thinks of poor people as lesser, I guarantee bullying this one girl over her economic status is not the only sign she\u2019s shown of thinking like this. Also, plenty of people grow up poor, become middle class or wealthy and then feel 0 empathy for those still in poverty. Spending some time without her luxuries isn\u2019t going to teach her empathy IMO, it\u2019s just going to make her want to avoid losing what she has again and unfortunately, being kind isn\u2019t a requirement for that.\n\nThe other option would be that she\u2019s just a bully in general and is saying whatever she can to hurt the other girl and doesn\u2019t actually believe what she\u2019s saying. In that case, the punishments is attempting to teach the wrong lesson anyway.", "As a kid who grew up poor my extended family always made sure we had what we needed. We kept food on the table but a lot of meals were chili, beans, cornbread, etc.But my eyes would light up when someone gave my Mom cash to take us to the movies and buy popcorn and soda.Other fun gifts we got were passes to the amusement park, and tickets to The Christmas Show at Rockefeller Center.\n\nI have donated AMC Gift Cards, Target Gift Cards and Dominoes Gift Cards.", "Backpack (can hold most of what you choose to get them)\u2026. School supplies, Quilt/Blanket, Toiletries (including teeth, hair & skin care items; maybe look for items that can be used with minimal water needed; dry shampoo/babywipes etc.), Stuffed animal, Durable Toys (that hold up & can travel well if required), Age appropriate Books, Clothing (socks, underwear, pajamas), Seasonal items/protection if needed (warm outerwear, gloves, hat)", "Having been this 6yo boy, comfortable clothes/ underclothes (I didn't realize you could buy new underwear before the old ones didn't have the elastic to stay on anymore until 2 years after I got married, my wife made me). It won't feel as special until they're older, but now it's some of my favorite charity things we received. \n\nA toy or 2 that are unique, I was so excited to save up $4.99 to get a Lazer from a gas station one time.  Just something cool,  but avoid battery powered (unless recharge is built in,  batteries required are the bane of poor kids,  batteries for toys are never in the budget)", "Yeah I can see it.  I don't think a lot of mainstream Christians realize what a \"bleeding heart\" Christ was in his day.  Loved kids too.", "I love this idea. I also second hiring the bullied girl to work and earn some money too.", "Same to you!", ">Ordinary part time job without daddy backing her? She might be actually working for the first time.\n\nEven better, she's responsible for fitting in with co-workers and making the shift as productive as possible.", "> Boo flipping who?\n\nThey literally said they're not defending the step-daughter, just pointed out that different kinds of jobs affect people differently.", "She still has a computer and other kids do just fine with way less. Sometimes you just gotta put in a little extra effort.", "We also don\u2019t know what this \u201cinnocent Raggedy Ann\u201d did or said to the daughter to cause this behavior. Everyone wants to jump on her with both feet only knowing one side (with a skewed perspective at that) of this story. Was this girl giving the daughter a hard time, calling her names, starting vicious rumors out of jealousy? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time this happened.", "You're fucking awesome.", "I'm just imagining I'm a poor kid and Christmas has always been a bit thin. Then I'm told I'm going to get some presents. yay! Then my presents are toothpaste and socks. \n\nI mean, that's what I tease my nieces and nephews with when they ask what I'm getting them. No kid wants toothpaste and socks for Christmas.", "I like this..I just don't know their situation. You just pick boy or girl and an age. They're loose income family, kids. The school sends food home with them every week.\nI don't know if they could get to a theater.\n\nI dont want to be like that episode of MASH. Where Winchester tried to give starving kids fancy kids instead of basic food and medicine. I still tear up every time I see that episode.", "Yes. That is the way all Christians are. People who just call themselves Christians, but don't live like Him are not Christians. Going to church every Sunday doesn't make one Christian. \nI have this discussion every time when people say \"...but almost all the Christians I meet are terrible....\" Just because so many fail to live up to His teachings does not invalidate the teacher or the His words.", "The Golden Rule is .....how everyone should live life. \nWhen I saw that a certain lawmaker said that Jesus just needed an AR 15 to avoid his crucifixion....I seriously wondered if this self identified Christian understood that the entire point of everything  IS the sacrifice Jesus made of himself...", "Looks like someone has a vendetta from their childhood", "Legos for fun, definitely.", "Fuck that with hygiene items -/ y\u2019all said \u201cgift.\u201d Give a gift -/ not a judgemental downer \u2014 or give \u2018em money \u2014 but what makes you think they must have bad hygiene? Like, \u201cwow if I could only afford soap I would praise Jesus\u201d fuck man come on", "It definitely depends on the situation. I try to find out in advance what the kids need. I volunteer at a shelter for women and kids who have fled domestic violence. They have a wishlist on Amazon that they update with new arrivals.", "Yeah, some people try to be like \"well that's just a no true Scotsman fallacy and you don't get to decide who's Christian, and -\"\n\nTrue, I don't get to decide that, but *Christ does*. Saying someone is totally a Christian because they say they are even if they are literally and specifically excluded from qualification *by Christ* is so bizarre and silly.\n\nI could call myself a member of the Golden State Warriors but that wouldn't make it true and they haven't even released a statement specifically saying I'm not one.", "Well said.", "Listen, I can totally do everything Steph Curry can but I can do it better and while drunk.", "That\u2019s great. Not every kid can balance that. I\u2019m a high school teacher and some kids can work a job while in school and do well. Some kids can\u2019t. They need more time to focus on school and working late/long hours spreads them too thin."]}
