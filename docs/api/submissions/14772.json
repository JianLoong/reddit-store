I told him this is extremely cruel because guinea pigs aren't meant to be outdoor animals, that they will die terribly, that his male guinea pig will be lonely and that he should try at least selling them or giving them away. But he always tells me it's \"impossible\" because \"nobody wants\" guinea pigs and that it's too much work to even try. And when I got pissed and yelled at him  for unreasonably treating his guinea pigs like that and called him cruel.

NTA\n\nkeep the guinea pigs and get rid of the boy", "NTA - He shouldn't have pets. Tell him to take the guinea pigs to the SPCA. They'll take them and find loving homes for them. Also tell him guinea pigs MUST have a companion. Keeping a single guinea pig is cruel.", "Treatment of animals is a show of character. Let that sink in. NTA", "NTA. Guinea pigs are pets, not wild animals. If he let them run in the wild, they'll die within days (if not hours). No way they will survive.\n\nTell him to at least TRY to put them up for free, or at least drop them at a shelter. Some of them take those kind of pets, not just cats & dogs.", "NTA. You're right, he shouldnt have pets if he doesn't want to deal with the responsibility. And tbh if I was in your position, I'd be looking into who to report him to if he does do it.", "NTA\n\nIt is not only cruel behavior, but also illegal for good reasons. He can have the male castrated and keep all three. The babies he could bring to an animal shelter or at least get some advice there.\n\nWho can't keep up the responsibility, should have no animals in the first place.", "NTA. Your boyfriend shouldn't have pets if his first response to an issue with them is to abandon them outside. \n\nThis would be such a red flag for me, OP. Cruelty to animals and a lack of empathy like this speaks to a lot of other potential character flaws.", "NTA in most countries it is also illegal to release animals into the wild. For the environment it is actually better if the released animals die rather than become an invasive species.\n\nIf he can't take care of the guinea pigs responsibly, then he should give them up for adoption.", "Absolutely NTA. He's irresponsible and cruel. He sentences his pets to death by letting them out in the wild. Contact his parents if you can and explain the situation. It's best to give the pets out or even try to contact a local pet store. I had rabbits and when they accidentally had babies we sold them to the pet store with no problems. If I were you I'd care about the guinea pigs more than the bf too. They're never \"just animals\". They're living breathing creatures that should be seen and treated as family members. They're not toys a person can just throw out.", "NTA. Your boyfriend isn\u2019t capable of taking care of his animals if he thinks like this. I hope they end up in good hands.", "NTA\n\nI don't normally advise this, but ditch this guy and take the lady pigs (even just to rehome)! It's a very concerning situation when somebody is trusted with the care and health of an innocent life and chooses to hurt/end that life for personal gain. Generally speaking, that's not the kind of person one wants to spend their time with.\n\nSave the pigs!", "NTA.\n\nAnimal cruelty as a child is a known precursor to sociopathy as an adult. I would recommend moving on.", "NTA. His route is a cruel way of expressing his acknowledgement that he can't take care of these guinea pigs, and he needs to search out an organization that will find good homes for all of them, including the male, which is unlikely to survive long in isolation after having companions for all this time. Your reaction was not overreacting, it was spot on.", "Keeping one male seperated at all times was already a cruel idea. \n\n\nMaking a little ad online, craigs list or something similar, is basically no work at all. \n\n\nYou bf sucks hard here. He doesn't even has the bare minimum guts to bring them to the vet or kill them himself. \n\n\nHe is old enough to know better.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nHow can he be upset with them? He should get the male neutered and can bring bBies to an animal shelter when. They are old enough. He really should surrender all of them. He was already treating them poorly by keeping the male alone. They're social animals. \n\nAnd typing guinea pig rescue into Google is literally zero effort. Im sure there's so.eone who would help amd at least at the shelter they'd have a chance at a better life. This experience should serve as a lesson to him to have empathy for animals in his care. Knowing how to care for them AND provide enrichment activity is part of animal husbandry. \n\nYou should probably also see this as a red flag since instead of listening to you and keeping an open mind,, he's accusing you of caring about the animals more than him and calling you names. You also deserve better.", "Wow. NTA. He sounds incredibly cruel or stupid. Firstly, pets should be neutered if you don\u2019t want them having babies. Also they are love animals and not stuffed teddy bears. They are completely dependent on you for food and safety. To essentially muster them and in such a way as to simply abandon them is so heartless. I could never be with someone who treats animals that way and think I\u2019m the ah for caring.", "NTA. Your BF is a totally, cruel AH. Those poor guinea pigs will very likely die. In most places abandoning your pets on the street is also illegal, even more so if they are not native animals. \n\nAlso how he kept them before was already bad. They are herd animals and should have been together, but seemingly the male was alone most of the times until an accident happened. He should have gotten the male guinea pig castrated. \n\nHe is totally irresponsible and his parents by the way, too. Though at 15 he should be even old enough himself to know better.\n\nAnd what he wants to do with his pets now, is just really cruel. \n\nPersonally I wouldn't want to be together with someone like him.\n\nThough for the sake of the poor animals, speak with his parents, siblings, whoever you know of his family and hope that someone of them is against animal cruelty. It is possible to find a new home, though not easily, but he and his family should try and otherwise suck it up and keep all.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d take those babies in a heartbeat if I could. There\u2019s always someone who wants Guinea pigs \u2014 my local PetsMart can hardly keep them in stock. He\u2019s definitely the AH for wanting to abandon these helpless domesticated animals in the wild. He\u2019s giving them a death sentence if he does that.", "YTA. After you expressed your opinion once, you had two reasonable ethical choices: keep your mouth shut or volunteer to find the guinea pigs a home.

It is absolutely cruel to abandon domesticated animals like guinea pigs, especially in a way that would cause them to suffer and potentially die. Your boyfriend has a responsibility to take care of his pets and provide them with a safe and healthy environment. It is not fair to simply kick them out onto the street, where they would be at risk of getting hit by a car, attacked by other animals, or succumbing to illness and starvation.  \nIt's also important to note that selling or giving away pets is a common and responsible option for pet owners who can no longer care for their animals. Your boyfriend's claim that it's \"impossible\" to find someone willing to take in guinea pigs is likely not true, and even if it were, it's still his responsibility to make every effort to find them a new home rather than simply abandoning them.  \nYour boyfriend's response, accusing you of caring more about the guinea pigs than him, is unfair and manipulative. It's possible to care about both animals and people, and in this case, you're simply advocating for the humane treatment of living creatures.", "NTA he\u2019s an AH!!

You should speak to a trusted adult so that the animals are treated humanely and your boyfriend gets help. I am not saying it will lead to something worse, but abusing an animal, and abandonment would be abuse, is not something to take lightly.", "NTA - Cant your bf find a good home for the piggies if he doesnt want them? Im sure there are plenty of people that would adopt them! Especially new born babies, you could even sell them and make a profit.\n\nIncredibly cruel to suggest just kicking them onto the street - red flag suggesting your bf is not a good person", "NTA. Break up with this dude. He's irresponsible and cruel.", "NTA! Obviously the guinea pigs can\u2019t make it alone. I have bunnies, so my advise is bring them to a rescue and they\u2019ll find them a new owner. And don\u2019t let the male live alone please.
