However, it is possible that Christina suffered through decades of infertility and pregnancies that ended in miscarriage that you don't know about before she finally had a baby.

Third is a boy with the patience of a saint, taking after his father.  I hit 50 and was in the throws of perimenopause... oldest hit puberty late-ish, middle hit puberty early-ish. The hormones hit the fan like the proverbial bullcrap and our family was completely insane for about 18 months.

It\u2019s even possible she was pregnant several times and miscarried, and OP\u2019s friend was just the one that worked. \n\nWe should not forget that people don\u2019t just exist in our time/place and all have stories that we know nothing about. Still, I agree NTA as every woman is the ultimate decision-maker as to whether she has children and when.", "Agree she needed to hear those words, and also *shouldn't have needed them to be said*.\n\nThese are facts and logic, but unfortunately feelings don't always align with those.\n\nThese events have probably caused a lot of feelings to come up for the mom - feelings she may have been pushing aside for a long time, and may have been unprepared for the intensity of them. Wanting to pout like a child seems very realistic for how one might feel at watching your daughter's best friend give her mother all the things you've been longing for - facts and logic aside. \n\nExpressing those feelings at these events is inappropriate and indeed indulging that childlike inclination. The mom is in the wrong here, undeniably.\n\nHaving said that, I urge you to have some compassion for her predicament. It's likely she didn't actually intentionally \"choose\" to have a baby so late, and that life in many ways chose for her. \n\nShe needs therapy to help her get through these feelings, not a dose of facts and logic. She is probably well-aware of her own timeline.\n\nAgain, her *expression* of these feelings, and to put them on her daughter (and by extension, you) is wrong. Her daughter owes her nothing of this sort, and should not be made to feel remotely guilty. Indeed, if someone would consider acting this way, especially at these events, it's likely this isn't the first time they've acted so childishly. So this instance may not even be the core issue.\n\nMom needs therapy. These are big feelings, big grief. Assuming she doesn't normally exhibit such selfish, narcissistic tendencies, I'd push therapy, rather than logic on her. Obviously neither would do much if that's not the case. \n\nYour boundaries are good. But logic isn't going to just \"pop\" her out of feeling this way. \n\nI'm sorry you're all having to go through this.", "Defo NTA, \"why aren't you planning your life and family around ME\" is never a reasonable standard to hold someone else to.", "I think 35+ is considered 'geriatric pregnancy' so while it's possible, it's certainly not a common thing (though becoming more popular)", "In Hamilton, when they have another baby and give him the same name as their son who was killed (name escapes me rn), mom was 45 when that kid was born, obviously well before IVF.", "Yeah. Senator Duckworth had a baby while in office at 49 I believe.", "It\u2019s really not that common to have a baby at 45 and comes with a really high risk of many issues.", "That's simply not true at all. There is an *increased* risk but that risk is still low.", "Sure and valid points, but no excuse for treating her daughter that way.", "By the time she\u2019ll have grandkids she\u2019ll have to put on her big girl Depends. I\u2019ll see myself out.", "It's a \"miscalculation\" because she wanted to have grandkids and presumably, watch them grow up... which she won't be able to do now.", "Your kid may see it differently and that\u2019s valid.", "If my grandparents on my father's side had been alive when I was born they would have been 109 and 97. On my mother's side my grandmother would've been barely 50. But she died before she turned 40. There is never any guarantee that you will have a long life and meet your grandchildren just because you had your children young.\n\nSome people seem to think that you're just about dead by the time you're 60 while I can't understand why it would be bad to be 60 and have a 20-year-old child. \"But energy levels...\". I understand that someone who had their kids in their 20s are exhausted and couldn't imagine having kids in their late 30s/early 40s but I bet that those of us who spent our 20s and a good portion of our 30s being childfree and just enjoying a somewhat carefree life definitely will have more energy than them.", "Speaking of geriatric pregnancies, a 69 year old woman gave birth a few years back. Yes, 69. There are some really unethical doctors in search of world records...", "It actually is really common. The term came from a French study from the 19th century, so not really reflective of the modern era. The average of a mother at her first birth has been steadily rising in the US since the 1940's.", "Yeah, pregnancies happen at that age. My great grandmother had her youngest in her 40s", "Uh...\n\nI'm sorry doctor.
