However, it is possible that Christina suffered through decades of infertility and pregnancies that ended in miscarriage that you don't know about before she finally had a baby.

Third is a boy with the patience of a saint, taking after his father.  I hit 50 and was in the throws of perimenopause... oldest hit puberty late-ish, middle hit puberty early-ish. The hormones hit the fan like the proverbial bullcrap and our family was completely insane for about 18 months.

And she\u2019s the only one who gave them a grandchild and she did it at 40 herself (happy accident) so they were in their 80s before they met a grandchild and lived until she was about 5. \n\nNo one is entitled to grandchildren just because they had children.

Wanting to pout like a child seems very realistic for how one might feel at watching your daughter's best friend give her mother all the things you've been longing for - facts and logic aside. \n\nExpressing those feelings at these events is inappropriate and indeed indulging that childlike inclination. The mom is in the wrong here, undeniably.\n\nHaving said that, I urge you to have some compassion for her predicament. It's likely she didn't actually intentionally \"choose\" to have a baby so late, and that life in many ways chose for her. \n\nShe needs therapy to help her get through these feelings, not a dose of facts and logic. She is probably well-aware of her own timeline.\n\nAgain, her *expression* of these feelings, and to put them on her daughter (and by extension, you) is wrong. Her daughter owes her nothing of this sort, and should not be made to feel remotely guilty. Indeed, if someone would consider acting this way, especially at these events, it's likely this isn't the first time they've acted so childishly. So this instance may not even be the core issue.\n\nMom needs therapy. These are big feelings, big grief. Assuming she doesn't normally exhibit such selfish, narcissistic tendencies, I'd push therapy, rather than logic on her.

No. I loved my grandmother and saw her every day, but the one who suffered the most from her death was my mother who had to continue living knowing she won't see her beloved mother anymore and with being alone while my father was at work and we attended school.
