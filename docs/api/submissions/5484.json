However, it is possible that Christina suffered through decades of infertility and pregnancies that ended in miscarriage that you don't know about before she finally had a baby.

Third is a boy with the patience of a saint, taking after his father.  I hit 50 and was in the throws of perimenopause... oldest hit puberty late-ish, middle hit puberty early-ish. The hormones hit the fan like the proverbial bullcrap and our family was completely insane for about 18 months.

It\u2019s even possible she was pregnant several times and miscarried, and OP\u2019s friend was just the one that worked. \n\nWe should not forget that people don\u2019t just exist in our time/place and all have stories that we know nothing about. Still, I agree NTA as every woman is the ultimate decision-maker as to whether she has children and when.", "Agree she needed to hear those words, and also *shouldn't have needed them to be said*.\n\nThese are facts and logic, but unfortunately feelings don't always align with those.\n\nThese events have probably caused a lot of feelings to come up for the mom - feelings she may have been pushing aside for a long time, and may have been unprepared for the intensity of them. Wanting to pout like a child seems very realistic for how one might feel at watching your daughter's best friend give her mother all the things you've been longing for - facts and logic aside. \n\nExpressing those feelings at these events is inappropriate and indeed indulging that childlike inclination. The mom is in the wrong here, undeniably.\n\nHaving said that, I urge you to have some compassion for her predicament. It's likely she didn't actually intentionally \"choose\" to have a baby so late, and that life in many ways chose for her. \n\nShe needs therapy to help her get through these feelings, not a dose of facts and logic. She is probably well-aware of her own timeline.\n\nAgain, her *expression* of these feelings, and to put them on her daughter (and by extension, you) is wrong. Her daughter owes her nothing of this sort, and should not be made to feel remotely guilty. Indeed, if someone would consider acting this way, especially at these events, it's likely this isn't the first time they've acted so childishly. So this instance may not even be the core issue.\n\nMom needs therapy. These are big feelings, big grief. Assuming she doesn't normally exhibit such selfish, narcissistic tendencies, I'd push therapy, rather than logic on her. Obviously neither would do much if that's not the case. \n\nYour boundaries are good. But logic isn't going to just \"pop\" her out of feeling this way. \n\nI'm sorry you're all having to go through this.", "Defo NTA, \"why aren't you planning your life and family around ME\" is never a reasonable standard to hold someone else to.", "I think 35+ is considered 'geriatric pregnancy' so while it's possible, it's certainly not a common thing (though becoming more popular)", "In Hamilton, when they have another baby and give him the same name as their son who was killed (name escapes me rn), mom was 45 when that kid was born, obviously well before IVF.", "Yeah.

Quite frankly, it\u2019s not her mom\u2019s business and she is putting a lot of unnecessary pressure on her. So good for you sticking up for her. And you did it tastefully. The truth hurts and she clearly was not ready to hear it. I hope it makes her think about how she\u2019s been making her daughter feel.

She sounds like she maybe wishes she had her kids younger so doesn't want her daughter repeating what she considers her mistake, which is absolutely not fair for her to do (your kids get to make their own decisions, they don't need projection).
