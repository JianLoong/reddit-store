I invited 4 of my friends out. The plan was to have a few drinks at mine then to head to town and see where the night tooks us. Now everyone was excited for that. \nMost of my friends, including me, smoke weed, except one who I will name Georgia (31F.) I have known Georgia since I was 6 and she has been my best friend since. She knows I smoke weed and respects my decision for it, doesn't try to stop me, as I respect her decision to not smoke, so I never have once forced her to smoke it, and I always make sure to not smoke it when I'm around her out of respect for her. \nGeorgia was a bit nervous to coming at first cause she knows my other friends smoke and she has never met them before. I assured her that she doesn't have to smoke if she doesn't want to and that I've told the other to limit what they smoke and if they smoke it, to smoke it in the other room, they were all happy with that and agreed and Georgia was happy to come along. \nThe night started off really well we were all laughing and having a good time then I got a phone call from my dad to wish my a happy birthday so I left the room to answer it. I thought I was only gone for a few minutes but turns out I was gone for long then that and by the night I came back I could smell the weed and I could see Georgia crying away from the others. \nI asked what was wrong and before she could answer, other friend, who I shall call Jessica (28F) said Georgia just started crying cause they decided to smoke in the loungeroom. \nGeorgia said that I lie and said that Jessica was trying to force Georgia to smoke some of the weed the whole time I was gone. \nI instantly started seeing red. I told Jessica that, that was not on and that I told her before hand she doesn't smoke and we need to respect that. She replied with that one cone won't hurt her and that she's being a baby about it. \nI then told her to get out of my house, the other two left as well and so it was just Georgia and me. We decided to just stay in and play board games and watch movies all night and we had fun. I turned my phone off for the night and when I turned it on it was blowing up with texts saying I was way out of line and that I ruined the night etc. \nNow I'm questioning if I went to far on kicking Jessica out of my house ?", "created_utc": 1695001525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lihhe/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my_house/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
