NTA. How can a child's birthday party have this much power over people? Something is very weird here. Got on vacation, take your two kids (they they require passports makes sure to find those before you wife hides them). \n\nOP, I highly recommend taking sometime to take a long hard look at your marriage. Something feels very off to me.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe vacation plans, time off requests and travel arrangements were already planned, scheduled and paid for already before the friend changed their party date. Your wife and step daughter are being unreasonable by asking you to waste money and your paid time off to accommodate this request. It's not your fault her friend changed the plans.\n\nIf your wife and step daughter can always catch a later flight, no reason you need to stay behind.", "NTA! Your wife and stepdaughter are being totally childish. Take the trip as planned with your other kids and leave your wife and daughter to do whatever.", "NTA in any way, as others said. In the meantime, try calling the airlines and asking if two tickets can be rescheduled. Sometimes they are really nice about that. I once made a return flight on the wrong day and when I mentioned it to someone they said to call and not reschedule online (which had a fee) and when I did they changed it for free.", "Assuming you were respectful in tone, didn't threaten, name call, etc., you are NTA. Vacations are expensive and a lot of work to plan AND you already made an effort to work around this birthday party in the first place.\n\nI can understand your daughter's desire to attend the party. What teen doesn't want to go to their best friend's birthday party, after all. I do find your wife's response a little baffling as she's an adult and would typically have a better grasp of the difficulty in cancelling or rescheduling a vacation. Alas, that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nThis sounds like a really frustrating situation and one that you do seem to have done your best to avoid until the other family changed the party date. (It doesn't matter but I do find myself curious as to why they did especially knowing that you all planned your trip specifically around the original day.)\n\nGood luck going forward.", "Nta it was nice of you to try to arrange it all so your step daughter didn\u2019t have to miss it but now that her friend has changed the date that\u2019s on them.

Take the kids and enjoy your holiday the rest is on them.", "You and the two kids fly as scheduled, your wife and stepdaughter catch up later PER THEIR CHOICE TO DO SO.\n\nNTA.\n\nIf I had to read between the lines, I would say your wife probably caters to her own daughter obsessively.", "I\u2019d say NTA because you did try to accommodate the party and it\u2019s not your fault that the date was changed. You did try to compromise by paying to have your daughter\u2019s ticket changed. Now the money for the trip is going to be wasted if your SD and wife don\u2019t attend. I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019re unwilling to budge when they see her bf and family often.

Your wife and step daughter can fly out after the party", "NTA!!!! Go and enjoy your 2 weeks with your kids and family. They have let you know where their priorities lay and it's with the best friend and being at her party. You only get to see family once a year and everyone involved knew this. I would also cancel their 2 tickets all together and let them spend the 2 weeks at home together.", "NTA. You already planned your vacation around their party so you shouldn't have to change it to accommodate the party. I don't get how a birthday party and a overseas family vacation are anywhere near the same. You came up with several viable solutions and your wife is being unreasonable by not listening to any of them.", "Nta you literally planned around the date given. Mom and kid can stay and attend then fly out to meet you.\n\nAnd I *would* tell the family.", "NTA. The throwers of said party put family ahead of friends. Why should you be expected to do differently? Why are they bending over backwards to go to a birthday party? Does everyone get a free pony?", "Why is it the two other kids have to miss out on a chunk of their vacation for someone they (presumably) don't know or care about. \n\nIf your wife wants to pay out the extra then she should go ahead and do it.

Speaking as a high school freshman, nothing is more important than spending time with the people you love before you go off to college. \n\nBesides, a one-week vacation is better than no vacation. \n\nSo, if I were you, I'd quit being a big baby and just stick around for the party, and then go on your vacation. Is it really that hard to make sacrifices for others?", "NTA - you had already planned the trip around the birthday party, it was the other family that changed it. Your wife is putting the birthday party before you, your time and your family.", "NTA. I think your plan is actually the solution.

Pack your bags and the kids bags and leave for the flight the morning of. If your wife and daughter show up, they show up, if they don't, that's on them.

It's completely unreasonable for your wife to 'put her foot down' on you and your other children.\n\nI'm really confused by the fact that your wife and daughter would set aside half of an overseas trip for this. Is there missing information here? Do they not get along with your family?", "Wow... reasonableness just went right out the window.   I am utterly baffled at your wife and stepdaughter's reaction to this.   I'm talking someone explaining differential equations to a golden retriever while blowing in a dog whistle level baffled. \n\nNTA NTA NTA.   Everyone knew everyone's dates.  Everyone knew this trip was happening.  \n\nYour wife and stepdaughter are being ridiculous.   I cannot imagine that the money (i.e. doubling the cost of the vacation) isn't enough to change minds.  Then of course there are all the time factors, loss of PTO,  that you'd be overseas for a \\_week\\_?   Lord you are barely getting through jetlag and then flying back?   \n\nIf I may suggest,  if its that important to them, then you can take the cost out of stepdaughter's college fund, savings, sell a car, future allowance and future christmas/birthday  presents.  Obviously money doesn't matter to them.  So just say \"ok I've got 10k (or whatever) to make up.  So 10k from the college fund (well 15k to cover all the penalties since this isn't an education expense).  No?  Oh... well lets sell your car... No?  Well.. I'm taking back all your presents.... No?  Well I thought this party was important to you but you don't want to pay for the ticket and hotel changes... so I'm getting mixed signals here\"", "Nta and your wife is being ridiculous", "NTA- your wife is being completely unreasonable. If this party happens every year then your wife and step-daughter can go next year. Why is this friends birthday SO important that it takes precedence over seeing your family for Christmas? I can't imagine justifying rearranging the entire families Christmas plans (and spending tons of extra money to do so) just so your wife and daughter can go to a teens birthday party...", "NTA - if your wife and stepdaughter do not see why they are AHs then just stop arguing. Your entire family structured their holiday around a child\u2019s (that they don\u2019t know) birthday party and then they change it. FFS you are totally right just to go.", "NTA: Wow talk about spoiled entitled brats. So, your supposed to rearrange your family vacation for your stepdaughter's friend's birthday party?\n\nSounds like you need to put your foot down and leave the brats behind. Cancel both your wife's and stepdaughter's flights and let them spend all the time they want with their friends.", "NTA. your wife and stepdaughter sound like entitled brats. you purposely scheduled around this party, it got changed. it\u2019s completely unreasonable to change your trip that\u2019s been paid for around that and since your wife is being immature and stubborn the literal only solution is for her and step daughter to fly out after. this should in no way shape or form affect your family vacation.", "Why can they not celebrate separately or at a different time. I understand she attends every year but does nothing wrong if she does something special with her friend on another date. I get your not wanting to shuffle around cause you invest time and money to get this worked out.\n\nWas the option for your wife and her daughter to fly down later, while you and your other kids go ahead as regularly planned? The cost to change is not great but I just do not understand why they aren't willing to compromise. You have at least made suggestions.", "NTA\n\nyour wife is being unreasonable. This is a birthday party for heavens sake. There will be another one next year.\n\nIt is time for you to put your Foot down, either your wife and Stepdaughter get on the plane with you and your 2 kids or they both stay at home and you will get a refund for their flights.", "NTA.   \n\nThis is serious?\n\nA huge battle about not missing the birthday party for a teen friend? That's wild. Totally makes no common sense.\n\nOf course you fly out.", "NTA.  Since when did this friend of your stepdaughter become more important that your entire family?  Your wife and stepdaughter are both the AHs here.  Keep your original plans, those 2 can fend for themselves.", "NTA. Did your wife and daughter fail to notice that although your family planned your trip around the dates of her friend's birthday party, her friend's parents couldn't be bothered to keep to their planned date, and they changed the party date for THEIR family's wishes. So in your daughter's and wife's eyes, not only does your daughter's friend take priority over your whole family, but your daughter's friend's extended family takes priority over your extended family.\n\nOne of two things happened here in the minds of your daughter's friend's parents. Either they have no respect for you whatsoever and expect you to absorb thousands of dollars in fees to change your flights, and expect you to miss half of your family vacation, or they actually don't really care if your daughter goes to this party or not.\n\n**I think the moral rule that should hold here is that you don't break prior plans because you got a better offer.** You made plans with your family, for specific dates, times, and places. You and your family all spent a lot of money on this group trip where you could all see each other. You would be letting them down if you only showed up for half of it, and that's in addition to the money it would cost you to change the dates. (And how will your family feel if you tell them you showed up a week late because of a teenager's party, or if your wife and daughter dont' appear because they rate a teen friend over their own family). You made a commitment to a particular party date. Your daughter's friend then changed her party date. A change of date is a whole new calendar item and you have no obligation to attend it, especially if you have a conflict with a prior commitment. You have a prior commitment because you've already bought tickets for your family trip. Nor do your daughter's friend's family, or your daughter, or your wife, have any right to expect that their new party date will take precedence over your nuclear family's existing commitment to visit your own extended family. The friend's family are the ones who created the conflict by changing the date. It's not your obligation to change your plans or be jerked around by them.\n\nYour daughter and your wife are being massive brats here and are being utterly disrespectful to your family.", "NTA\n\nThe best solution.\n\nYou and your other kids fly as planned and let your wife and daughter plan hoe they pay and organize their changes.\n\n\nI cant understand why your wife prefer a kids birthdayparty than a vacation with her family\u2026", "NTA. This is totally a hill I would die on.", "NTA. Birthdays happen every year. Family gatherings overseas don't happen all that often, if at all. Your stepdaughter and wife could celebrate separately with the friend before they leave or do what you suggested and go to the party then come after, letting you go to *your* family.

They\u2019re the ones turning this into a drama!! NTA", "I wouldn't even try. I'd leave it alone and just take the flight with the two kids... If mom and daughter show they show, if they don't they miss out and it's on them.", "Even more confusing to me is how the daughter's \"best friend\" and her family moved a party date after knowing OP's vacation was planned around it. Must not be as important to them as your wife and daughter think.  \n\nGoing early and letting them stay is the only thing that makes any sense. What adult prioritizes a kids party over her children and husband going on a expensive, carefully planned vacation to see family.  \n\nHonestly, I don't think people are being nearly harsh enough with the mom for demanding that *everyone* have a more expensive, shorter vacation. How the hell is the solution: everyone sit around for 2 days instead of enjoying Europe?

He should give up time with his siblings, who he only gets to see once a year for a birthday party? Someone who the stepdaughter could have a falling out with  by the end of the school year?\n\nEDIT: And cutting the trip in half adds cost on top of everything else.", "Life lessons ahead.\n\nIn the adult world, money doesn\u2019t grow on trees. I went on a 2 weeks European vacation and the flights and hotel for my family cost almost $8000. Assuming the OP\u2019s cost are similar, he\u2019ll have to fork out another $8000. Most people don\u2019t have $8000 in the bank.\n\nAlso adults have to get their vacation request approved far in advance. Christmas vacation dates are the most sought after so few get them. Where I work, people bribe other people in their group to work around Christmas so they can get their vacation request approved.", "It's clear that you are still a child.

It's just a birthday party, FFS. She can go to the next one or spend some time with her friend when she returns.", "As someone whose 11 years removed from high school, you are dead wrong. 99% of those people you wont keep in contact with in any meaningful way. BTW hotels will charge you because you are changing so close to the date and they'll be losing money, same with airlines so its not as simple as you make it out to be. Also, anyone who works a full 40 hours minimum that there is a world's difference between one and two weeks of vacation.", "The friend has no problem putting her family above your stepdaughter.
