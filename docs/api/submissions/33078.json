My wife and I have 2 children together. My stepdaughter\u2019s best friend has a birthday in December. We are well aware of her birthday because we attend it every year. This year my side of the family planned to take a huge overseas Christmas vacation which required us to ask the friend\u2019s mother for the party date. We planned and bought our tickets to leave 2 days after the party so that my stepdaughter wouldn\u2019t miss it.\n\nMonday my stepdaughter came home and told us that the party date was moved to accommodate some of her friend\u2019s family members who decided last minute to fly in for it. The problem is that the date was moved to one well after our departure date.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. 1st, we\u2019re not made of money so for us to change the flight and hotel for our family will more than double the cost. 2nd, it will be a 2 weeks overseas trip so I already had my vacation approved and can\u2019t change it. If we fly out after the party, my vacation will be cut down to only a week. 3rd, I only get so see some of my siblings only at Christmas so if I don\u2019t go this year, I won\u2019t see them until next year. 4th, my entire side of the family planned our vacation around the party date months ago.\n\nMy original solution was to tell her friend\u2019s parents to keep their original date since my family planned around their schedule. My wife immediately shot down that idea. My 2nd solution was for us to leave as planned but change only my stepdaughter\u2019s ticket since she\u2019s on break and is old enough to fly herself. My wife shot that down too since she\u2019s also friends with the other mother and wants to go to the party. My wife\u2019s solution is for us to just fly out after the party. I don\u2019t like this idea at all because of the added cost and lessening time.\n\nOur talked turned into arguments that\u2019s lasted all week. Last night my wife put her foot down said that we\u2019re not missing the birthday party to which I replied that she\u2019s not missing the birthday party. I told her I\u2019m flying out with our 2 kids as planned whether or not she\u2019s on the flight.\n\nThat took our argument to the next level to the point my stepdaughter called me an AH so I tried to ground her at which point my wife said I couldn\u2019t because she was justified. Everything is a mess now.\n\nUpdate\n\nThere are 2 common questions and I think I should answer.\n\nIt\u2019s a sweet 16 birthday party.

NTA. How can a child's birthday party have this much power over people? Something is very weird here.

Something feels very off to me.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe vacation plans, time off requests and travel arrangements were already planned, scheduled and paid for already before the friend changed their party date.

Your wife and stepdaughter are being totally childish. Take the trip as planned with your other kids and leave your wife and daughter to do whatever.", "NTA in any way, as others said. In the meantime, try calling the airlines and asking if two tickets can be rescheduled. Sometimes they are really nice about that. I once made a return flight on the wrong day and when I mentioned it to someone they said to call and not reschedule online (which had a fee) and when I did they changed it for free.", "Assuming you were respectful in tone, didn't threaten, name call, etc., you are NTA.

What teen doesn't want to go to their best friend's birthday party, after all. I do find your wife's response a little baffling as she's an adult and would typically have a better grasp of the difficulty in cancelling or rescheduling a vacation. Alas, that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nThis sounds like a really frustrating situation and one that you do seem to have done your best to avoid until the other family changed the party date.

You already planned your vacation around their party so you shouldn't have to change it to accommodate the party.

I'm talking someone explaining differential equations to a golden retriever while blowing in a dog whistle level baffled. \n\nNTA NTA NTA.   Everyone knew everyone's dates.  Everyone knew this trip was happening.  \n\nYour wife and stepdaughter are being ridiculous.   I cannot imagine that the money (i.e. doubling the cost of the vacation) isn't enough to change minds.  Then of course there are all the time factors, loss of PTO,  that you'd be overseas for a \\_week\\_?   Lord you are barely getting through jetlag and then flying back?   \n\nIf I may suggest,  if its that important to them, then you can take the cost out of stepdaughter's college fund, savings, sell a car, future allowance and future christmas/birthday  presents.  Obviously money doesn't matter to them.  So just say \"ok I've got 10k (or whatever) to make up.  So 10k from the college fund (well 15k to cover all the penalties since this isn't an education expense).  No?  Oh... well lets sell your car... No?  Well.. I'm taking back all your presents.... No?

I understand she attends every year but does nothing wrong if she does something special with her friend on another date. I get your not wanting to shuffle around cause you invest time and money to get this worked out.\n\nWas the option for your wife and her daughter to fly down later, while you and your other kids go ahead as regularly planned?

Did your wife and daughter fail to notice that although your family planned your trip around the dates of her friend's birthday party, her friend's parents couldn't be bothered to keep to their planned date, and they changed the party date for THEIR family's wishes. So in your daughter's and wife's eyes, not only does your daughter's friend take priority over your whole family, but your daughter's friend's extended family takes priority over your extended family.\n\nOne of two things happened here in the minds of your daughter's friend's parents. Either they have no respect for you whatsoever and expect you to absorb thousands of dollars in fees to change your flights, and expect you to miss half of your family vacation, or they actually don't really care if your daughter goes to this party or not.\n\n**I think the moral rule that should hold here is that you don't break prior plans because you got a better offer.** You made plans with your family, for specific dates, times, and places. You and your family all spent a lot of money on this group trip where you could all see each other. You would be letting them down if you only showed up for half of it, and that's in addition to the money it would cost you to change the dates. (And how will your family feel if you tell them you showed up a week late because of a teenager's party, or if your wife and daughter dont' appear because they rate a teen friend over their own family). You made a commitment to a particular party date. Your daughter's friend then changed her party date. A change of date is a whole new calendar item and you have no obligation to attend it, especially if you have a conflict with a prior commitment. You have a prior commitment because you've already bought tickets for your family trip. Nor do your daughter's friend's family, or your daughter, or your wife, have any right to expect that their new party date will take precedence over your nuclear family's existing commitment to visit your own extended family. The friend's family are the ones who created the conflict by changing the date. It's not your obligation to change your plans or be jerked around by them.\n\nYour daughter and your wife are being massive brats here and are being utterly disrespectful to your family.", "NTA\n\nThe best solution.\n\nYou and your other kids fly as planned and let your wife and daughter plan hoe they pay and organize their changes.\n\n\nI cant understand why your wife prefer a kids birthdayparty than a vacation with her family\u2026", "NTA.

So thats 10k for 5 people, out of the gate.  To change a non refundable ticket,  going by Delta airlines, you are looking at maybe 400 bucks max to change, PLUS if there is a difference in cost you are eating that (It seems logical to me that last minute changes such as this will see that available tickets will have risen in price due to the seasonal costs).   As OP already said this will about double the cost of everything,  so lets call it 10k more for people to leave a week later.  And we're just talking flights.   ANNND we're just talking cost,  who can say if people would be able to sit together let alone be on the same flight, or myriad other complications.    AND we're not even talking about lodging changes. \n\nI am having a hard time, unless they are uber wealthy, that any doting mom will, when faced with just the cost alone of going to some teen bday party, react as she has.

Honestly I'm struggling to afford groceries here. But no you shouldn't have to move your vacation and they need to decide what's more important vacation or the super sweet 16 birthday party. In 20 years what will be more important?", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s stupid reasoning on your wife\u2019s part.  She can miss the party.  There will be another one and I am sure that she sees these people all the time.", "I\u2019m with those that believe your wife and step daughter never wanted to go on your family vacation.  \n\nThe Sweet 16 of a close friend that is going to be a major social event for your step daughter and your wife isn\u2019t \u201cjust a birthday party \u201c. It isn\u2019t about celebrating later with a smaller gathering.  It is about a major social event not to be missed. \n\nSo the question becomes why your wife is so very, very angry that you and your two other kids going to Europe without you is such a deal; why the loss of money is not s problem., etc. \n\nTry to find out. Also try to find out how the mom of the part girl was able to make last minute changes in the party date without taking a big hit herself on costs.  \n\nPerhaps wife and step daughter have never felt accepted in your family.  \n\nPerhaps they really did want to go nut dislike the idea of three family members going without them. If that were the case, your wife and or step daughter would be okay with flying in a little late and they are not. \n\nYour step daughter may want to make the trip but her mom is getting in the way. Find out.  \n\nYou and your other two kids not showing up at the party may be an  embarrassment to your wife; especially if she has to e plain why you aren\u2019t there to her friend.\n\nAny way it breaks, you and your two kids should go to Europe.  Your wife isn\u2019t giving any reason to make you stay home other than having her whole family show up for the birthday party.", "NTA. I think you offered the best compromise,  they can stay and the rest of the family can go and they can meet you there (assuming you can afford it). It's not reasonable to expect you and your other two kids to miss out due to a birthday party,  even if it's a sweet 16.\n\nWhile I find it silly,  if your wife and daughter would rather go to the party than spend a few days in europe, I would be fine with them staying (again assumimg you can afford it). But I can't fathom why it's so important to them that you and your other two kids stay.", "NTA If possible get a refund on their tickets. Go to Europe with the younger kids and spend the extra money on them and your family that you hardly ever get to see. This biggest problem I see is your wife and daughter see these people regularly. This family knew you planned this trip. Changed the dates on you knowing full well you wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. Ditching your wife and stepdaughter. On your way out the door tell her not to disturb your vacation and you will talk about it when you get home. Marriage counseling is on the table if you\u2019re open to it.", "This is wild. You\u2019re def NTA especially since your family planned around some party. Then they changed it up on you. Not your fault. Go on your vacation, take the two kids, wife can go after and be butthurt about it. Those two need to stop being so selfish.", "NTA I think you are absolutely justified. If going to the friends party is more important (which is ridiculous over a family vacation) then they give up the vacation or come later. I mean would the friends family have done that?  I am shaking my head over this one.", "Don't let your wife bully you. Take your two children and enjoy your vacation.  She and stepdaughter do whatever they want.", "NTA she\u2019s just a friend not a family member. Her birthday isn\u2019t a live or die situation it\u2019s literally just a birthday. Big whoop she\u2019s turning 16, your daughter can see her the day yall planned and give her a gift. Hell make it special and be just the two of them. Your wife and step daughter sound insufferable at the moment. THEY can stay and miss the flight for some friend if they want to. You\u2019re very much right to just go without them. No one is forcing them to not go they\u2019re choosing not to. And their friend changed the date last minute that\u2019s not cool on them either.", "NTA \nYou just have to kowtow to her demands? No way.  Just go as planned and let her decide what to do on her own.", "NTA. Enjoy your trip with your other 2 kids. The wife and SD can join later but I'd definitely tell them that if they're going to join you that you don't want to hear them whine and complain about it. If they complain about that tell them to stay home. Don't be a doormat", "NTA. If this party is so big then how did they manage to change the date so close to the original party date? If they rented a venue then it would most likely have been booked up for the holiday season, and don't forget the caterer also. Was the date change a long time ago and your step-daughter only told you now or was this a last minute change? Either way it doesn't make sense for you and your other 2 kids to fly out on a different date. Your wife and step-daughter can change their flights, if they are lucky enough to still have seats available, and join you later.", "NTA. You planned your vacation around the original date months in advance. They decided to change the dates after you finalized plans. What about the other 2 kids? Is it fair for them to shorten their vacation for the friend of their sister? Just because her friend's plans changed doesn't mean yours will or should.", "No your wife is. Since when is a high schoolers birthday more important than a family vacation. She sees the kid all the time.  I wouldn't change the plans, but would gladly cancel mom and daugther's tickers and they can stay home the whole trip. They are just going to make everyone miserable regardless of what you do.", "NTA at all. You guys were accommodating. Your wife is a giant asshole, wanting you to sacrifice time with your family over this when you already planned and accommodated those people. They just flaked out on you. Your wife should be by your side, not a suck up for her friends.", "NTA, they're being unreasonable. They can fly out later, or miss the vacation, but it's absurd to expect you to change it after you literally planned the vacation around the party date.\n\nAnd your wife shouldn't have let her daughter call you an asshole without punishment. She sounds like a real piece of work.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is acting like the potential financial hit and fact that you\u2019ll be making the most sacrifice because the party was rescheduled is reasonable.\n\nThe obvious solution is you and the kids go, they come after the party. It\u2019s a smaller financial hit, you get to use your vacation fully, you see your siblings etc etc.\n\nWhy it has to be all or nothing from your wife is crazy. Stepdaughter is just taking her cues from her mom and being a typical teen who can only want what she wants. Doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s ever been challenged with having to prioritize anyone else before.", "NTA, sucks to be your wife and SD, but it's NOT your fault nor your responsibility to accommodate her friend. You were very, very accommodating to adjust around the party when you scheduled the trip. It's not your fault they rescheduled the party.", "Stupid party!!! So for some family she inconvenient the other 80 people invited  ??!!! Near Christmas time??!! Is she Maria , mother of God, because child\u2019s birthday is on 25th  ??!! How was she able to change the venue  ??!! NTA and she can stay behind with daughter!!! If they were true friends like family and knew very well you had tickets planned in advance wouldn\u2019t move it for the ones who made plans last minute. Changing reservations during Christmas time it is like booking from the beginning and paying double !!! NTA do not cave !!!!", "NTA.  Mom/wife and step daughter can attend party and fly out to join the family vacation 2 days later (ideally, Mom would pay for the flight change.  I think that it really stinks that the other family changed the party dates but I'm sure that they can justify in their minds.  Was your entire family invited to the stepdaughters sweet 16?  if not, why should your younger daughter miss out on a family vacation because their mom and older sister want to attend a party that they cannot attend.", "NTA. Your whole extended family already made plans with consideration to someone's birthday they have nothing to do with, you've done enough for the sake of that party. They didn't give any consideration to you in changing a date they already had fixed. You have no reason to dance to their tunes, go on your vacation.", "I think you came for the great idea that you go with your two kids. Change only two of the tickets for your step daughter and wife to join you a little bit later on.  Everyone wins even if they lose a little bit.", "NTA  I think your wife is the AH here.  \n\nYou made very sincere efforts to time your travel to not interfere with the party and at the last minute they changed the party on you.  Not your fault  It also makes sense that you prioritize a trip to see your family over a teenager birthday party, why would you personally care about attending the party? \n\nI also understand why your step-daughter would prioritize the party - it's a big event in her world, this is a special friend and family and your family isn't even related to her so maybe she doesn't care that much about seeing them.   \n\nIt's your wife whose behavior makes no sense.  You offered good solutions to let them attend the event that's important to them and you attend the one that's important to you.  What more does she want?  Apparently unless you give up your family travel, it's not good enough for her.  She's the problem here.", "Most people's pecking order: Family, Family that are all making a special effort to (1) see each other after a long time and (2) enjoy a fabulous 2-week overseas vacation, friend's birthday party.\n\nYour wife and stepdaughter's pecking order: FRIEND, FRIEND, FRIEND, family who???, money spent on travel plans???, no - just FRIEND.\n\nTake the trip with your other kids. Wife and stepdaughter can live according to their values; but they cannot expect your entire family to.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI dont know why you all are arguing because your plan sounds very good to me - wife stays with the eldest daughter and attends party, you and two kids go on the planned vacation on planned day. Simple! Why all the name calling?", "Your wife is acting like a selfish jerk, it\u2019s highly likely she told her daughter\u2019s mother it was no big deal to delay before you were told, and the SD is just being a typical selfish teenager. Aka your wife is the primary AH in a big way. Sadly, it\u2019s a defining moment in the relationship, and it\u2019s also likely the wife has already demonstrated this type of behavior in the relationship before, but not to this magnitude. Go on your trip as planned, but do make sure the SD actually knew you\u2019d offered to change just her ticket (while everyone else left for vacation including her mother) so she could fly in later by herself, but her mother said no.", "NTA. Make sure your wife can\u2019t mess with the tickets or reservations.", "Why can\u2019t they just fly out to meet you after themselves? The mom is a big girl she can take care of them both??? Nta", "Your wife is nuts.  You're NTA.\n\nLet your daughter stay with the friend while you're on vacation for cussing at you", "NTA. If sounds like the biggest issue here is that things got heated/escalated with emotions. The situation is what it is as far as the party's date, but you shouldn't have to change your schedule to accommodate. I think your wife/SD should stay back to go to the party then fly out after while you stick to your original plan. Ideally the wife/SD should find a way to pay you back somehow for the additional cost of changing the flights, whether it be with actual money or chores etc... but the biggest thing here is to de-escalate and compromise.", "NTA. The only reason I can imagine your wife is insisting you wait id what if god forbid you have fun overseas while they only go to this birthday party. Then she\u2019ll feel like an idiot. So everyone must sacrifice so her fun doesn\u2019t get outshone.", "You offered viable alternatives that would not cut time or inflate spending.    It\u2019s not your fault that your wife refused them.", "YTA because you should just allow your stepdaughter to choose.  \n\nBoundaries are simple: i looked into rescheduling and it's not possible. It's not our trip. It's someone else's trip and they invited us along.   \n\nYou choose if you want to attend your friends birthday or come on the trip.  It's your first big welcome to adulthood choice in life.  \n\nSimple.", "Info : are you yet another divorcee parent who refuse to see their new partner not caring about their kid ?", "Why were you arguing in front of your step-daughter?!? Unless you raised her from the time she was a baby, you have no business grounding her! She's not your child and unless you have permission from your wife, you don't discipline her. That's her mother's job. Other than that, your solution to go ahead and take your 2 kids with you was good. Mom can pay to have their 2 tickets changed.  Simple.", "Nah. I can understand both sides. Imo I'd say let both your daughter and wife leave late to meet up with rest of your family.\nIt's unfortunate timing but something important to them is overlapping with something that was planned at the same time. It's unexpected.\nIt seems like a once in a lifetime thing for them, so if that's what they want to do then meet in the middle.\nIt's not their fault and it's a risk of planning two events close.\nI don't blame you for being upset but I can see why they are upset too.", "There's got to be more to this story. \n\nMy dad was a control freak who'd have had a fit if I'd suggested missing an overseas vacation for a birthday party. Especially at that age and for once I'd have agreed with him because that's just...nuts!!\n\nI think this dad has conveniently left out that the 2 girls are more than just friends which would make a lot of sense to me because at that age, the daughter would absolutely want to be with her girlfriend. \n\nI can absolutely see that the stepdad doesn't accept her or her sexuality and his family doesn't either which is why her mom is standing up for her. \n\nSo yeah OP....YTA", "> One of two things happened here in the minds of your daughter's friend's parents.
