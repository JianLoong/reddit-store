But since my partner wants and should have a relationship with his sisters we continued to visit them once in a while. \n\nLast year I found out I was pregnant and the first thing she told me was to not keep it, whatever, everything she says kind of goes in one ear and out the other one. She did not check up on me once my entire pregnancy until the day she asked if we were going to invite her to the hospital and flipped when I said no. When my son was born she visited him once, took pictures and then didn\u2019t message or call for over a month. Since then she\u2019s invited us over a few times but never came by to actually see him. \n\nNow my baby is 3 months old and we decided to go over last time she invited us. There was a lot of unsolicited advice and I just smiled and nodded the entire time until my boyfriend mentioned that my mom was coming over (she lives 2 hours away) every other weekend to visit and also help us out. My partner told her that if sometime she wanted to watch him it would be ok (we don\u2019t need her to, it was only if she wanted to spend time with my baby). Her response was \u201csure, but just so you know I won\u2019t be following these foolish rules you have. At my house the baby eats solids and watches TV and if I feel like it I\u2019ll give him some treats too\u201d. \n\nMy jaw was on the floor with the audacity. I told her she was no longer invited to watch him and that she will not be seeing my baby until I decide she respects out parenting. I know it was harsh because she actually didn\u2019t do any of these things     My partner agrees with me but now his entire family is mad at me and saying \u201cit\u2019s normal for grandparents to do what they want when babysitting\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t help but think I was too harsh.

I would have said much the same.\n\nHowever, you told us the following:\n\n* you are already LC with this woman, by her choice. You visit her only because your partner wants a relationship with his sisters\n* she offered her unsolicited opinion on your reproductive choices\n* she was uninterested in your wellbeing during your pregnancy\n* despite this lack of interest, she assumed she had the right to be invited to the hospital when you gave birth\n* you don't **need** her to babysit.\n\nIt's clear that neither of you likes this woman. You merely tolerate her. (Whether you're justified is not the issue here. I'm taking your word for it that she is unfriendly and that neither side is interested in having a close relationship.)\n\nWith all that in mind, why in the name of dog did your partner say \"*if sometime she wanted to watch him it would be ok*\"? FFS, why not wait until she offers - **if** she offers, which she may not?\n\nDoes your partner actually enjoy stirring up drama when there was no need? If he'd just kept his trap shut, you could have continued with the usual chilly politeness and then taken your leave without any unpleasantness.\n\nI suggest you decide whether you are LC with her or not, and if you really are, then stick to it.
