These things happen, I wouldn\u2019t of stuck around either.", "NTA, and I'm sorry you had to go through that experience twice on the same day. Would I be correct this isn't the first time he has \"joked\" about things?", "NTA. Dads! Who'd have them? Whereas he is right that it isn't something to be embarassed about, it certainly isn't something you should be mocked with either.", "NTA\n\nTell him to remember you're the one who's gonna pick his nursing home.", "NTA. That wasn\u2019t a \u201cjoke\u201d, that was intentional humiliation. He is just embarrassed that he didn\u2019t get away with it this time, he is embarrassed you called attention to his shockingly demeaning behavior.", "NTA, your dad is being awful, holy moly. He is embarrassed because HIS behavior was awful and your reasonable reaction to it drew attention to his behavior.", "I had a period accident at work when I was your age. 20+ years later and I am still traumatized and humiliated when I think about it. \n\nNTA. Your dad is a jerk. It would be nice if we weren\u2019t humiliated and berated for normal bodily functions when things go wrong \ud83d\ude11.", "Jokes are funny. Bullying isn't funny. There's nothing funny about what he was doing, and his behavior was way beyond acceptable.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThee are no jokes, your dad is an abusive AH.", "I like that he's whining about you embarrassing him when his \"joke\" was solely intended to embarass you. Tell him he's being too sensitive. NTA", "I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. It\u2019s awful when a parent not only is unsupportive but opts to run you down. NTA", "Nta. Mocking someone for something they can\u2019t control is stupid", "NTA but your dad is. It's every woman's nightmare and I'm sorry this happened to you.", "NTA.  Your choices were to sit there and let your father humiliate you, throw a drink in his face (or otherwise confront him) or walk away.  Walking away was probably the best choice.", "NTA. Your father is an idiot child that doesn\u2019t know the first thing about women or manners. He should be ashamed of himself and be begging you to forgive him. This is the kinda shit families go no-contact for *years* over. What a fucking asshole he is! \n\nTake none of his words to heart and just keep being you. Most men aren\u2019t like that, which your father would know if he ever grows up to become one.", "NTA \n\nStand your ground. I say this as mother to a 22 female whose dad makes jokes about everything. I love him to pieces but he sometimes doesn\u2019t realize he has gone too far. He knows he goes too far because we tell him and don\u2019t let it slide until he acknowledges his words hurt even if that was not the intention. \n\nYour dad might never admit his wrongs but I hope he will actually listen to what you are saying and realize he hurt you. If he is like my husband it sounds like he might be making a joke out of something that he doesn\u2019t want you to be uncomfortable over.", "OP's dad is TA and a huge immature bully! What kind of a tactless clod goes out of their way to publicly humiliate their own daughter !\n\nOP, I'm so sorry your dad did that to you! Huge hugs flying your way!"]}
