I'd suggest stepping down from MOH so that, if baby does come, you won't be messing up the wedding. It's a twist no one expected, but I would hope she is happy for you and looking forward to being an aunt!", "NTA. It really infuriates me when people like your sister get upset because their family will have two good things happen in one year. There are so many families that would give anything to have one piece of good news. I know many families that have endured back to back tragedies and for many   of them it feels like every time their phone rings, there\u2019s bad news on the other end. Your sister needs to stop being a short sighted brat and be grateful that both she and her sister are both well and thriving in their individual lives.", "How dare you not put your entire life on hold for a year while your sister has a party!\n\nNTA", "Your sister is getting mad at you for having sex a few months ago and you didn\u2019t stop to think about her wedding.  You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. \n\nIf she is that bothered, then she could postpone the wedding a bit.\n\nIts not like you can postpone giving birth!\n\nYou have nothing whatsoever to feel guilty about. Dont beat yourself up about it.\n\nYou have been trying for years and now you have succeeded. Imo a wedding is unimportant in comparison. \n\nCongratulations btw and I wish you the best of luck with the pregnancy", "NTA she doesn't dictate your sex life. Just step down from being MOH.", "NTA you say you have been trying for a while so clearly has not been an easy journey.\nI get concerns around perhaps missing it as you say but it\u2019s now something out of your hands. I\u2019m sure there is enough love and joy to go around for your family / friends to be happy for everyone.", "NTA You\u2019ve been trying for YEARS! There was nothing to postpone. Nothing was happening!\n\nDitch the guilt, sistah. This is all joy. Embrace it. Surely your family has the bandwidth to be happy about a baby and a wedding AT YHE SAME TIME!!!\n\nReally, your sister should be feeling nothing but joy for you right now. You\u2019re both having an epic, life-changing February. Celebrate!", "NTA congratulations! Your sister is being selfish. Hopefully she realises that soon and starts being happy for you. \n\nWill you bow out of MOH duties?", "NTA.  Congrats!  I\u2019m actually sort of in the same boat, so I\u2019m a little bias.  Nature will find a way.  And when you\u2019re having trouble conceiving, \u201cjust waiting\u201d is another precious egg possibly going to waste.  Surely you have a due date?  Perhaps, assuming the baby is born before the wedding and you\u2019re still willing to participate, leave the baby with someone at home, probably wouldn\u2019t want a newborn exposed to sooo many new people and possible germs (I\u2019m thinking cold sores, oh the sad, sad stories) their immunity is not ready to handle.", "Both my sisters (one my MOH and one a bridesmaid were both like 8 months pregnant at my wedding). I was not upset in the slightest and we just chose a dress that would accommodate all of the women. Why are people so self-centered? NTA.", "NTA. Your life can\u2019t revolve around her wedding. Step down as her MOH. Don\u2019t let her make you feel bad for expanding your family. I swear brides are so self centered sometimes.", "NTA. What is it with people who think everyone else should put their lives on hold because they are getting married. Can't be pregnant, can't wear an engagement ring, can't share your joy. I remember when these things actually added to the joy of occasions.", "NAH - it\u2019s fine that she feels a little shaken up, she had a vision for her day and now she\u2019s not going to get quite what she thought she would. Her expectations and reality are no longer meeting and that does suck. This doesn\u2019t make you an AH for getting pregnant though. Hopefully she\u2019ll shake off the mojo and be happy for you and excited that she\u2019s soon to be an aunt. If she starts to be an AH about a situation that\u2019s frankly a bit outside of your control given your difficulties conceiving, then that\u2019s a whole other thing. I hope she has a beautiful wedding day and congratulations on your pregnancy!", "NTA. she can get tf over it and deal", "Your sister\u2019s being ridiculous and self-centered. I\u2019ve been to soooo many weddings with pregnant bridesmaids, including my own. It\u2019s not a big deal at all. She should be happy for you instead of being a me monster. The world does not revolve around her wedding.", "NTA. You don't control when you become pregnant. It happens when it is meant to happen. Due dates are only approximate times of delivery, but your baby can be delivered either before or after the due date. If she is so concerned about you not fulfilling the role of the maid of honor, then your sister should ask someone else. I hope your sister will realize how absurd she is being, and let it go. She is being ridiculous.", "Really? WTF?!   \n\n\nThe most narcissist accusation I\u2019ve ever heard. Many, many bridesmaids have appeared in maternity dresses. To turn a celebration into this is inexcusable.", "NTA If your sister truly cared about you she would be very excited that after years of trying it has finally happened. Focus on your new family.", "NTA. Your sister is being dumb AF if she's surprised her married sister who she knows is actively trying for a baby is, uh, pregnant.   \nAlso, honestly, she should be happy for you instead of being focused on what is, after all, just a big goddamn party.", "NTA. Your sister is suffering from Main Character Syndrome. Tell her that if she can't be happy for you and celebrate something that you've been wishing for years and it finally happened, then you can't be there to celebrate her big moment either. Seriously, who is so deluded as to expect people to plan things such as pregnancies around their wedding? Especially knowing how long you've been trying.", "NTA. She knew you were trying when she asked so she knew it was a possibility. \n\nBut you should step down as Moh. Giving the timing you most likely won\u2019t be able to fulfill your duties or participate in much of the \u2018to do\u2019 around pree wedding stuff.", "NTA, you can't always plan parenthood. Enjoy!", "NAH. I get that your sister wants her day to be about her, but you can\u2019t put your own life on hold for six months.\n\nPlease don\u2019t feel guilty.\n\nCongrats on the pregnancy!", "NTA for getting pregnant, of course. However, if the two events really are that close together, you should really step down from MOH.", "Congrats on the baby! But NTA at all. I'm honestly astounded by the number of posts here that talk about brides who expect ppl close to them to put their lives on hold for the upcoming weddings. Idk what it is about weddings that seem to inflate their egos so much. I get it, it's a big day and they wanna be the centre of attention, look amazing etc, but wtf. Expecting you to wait another 9 months before trying for a baby is so stupid. Especially given that she knows you've been trying for so long without any success. \n\nIf I was you, I'd just tell her to choose another MOH so you can just attend as a guest. Tbh, reading this made me so angry that I probably wouldn't even attend the wedding at all. What she said to you is f'ed up. Weddings are about celebrating with the ppl that you love, not about demanding everyone to do everything your way. If anything, she should be excited that she's gonna be an aunt and will have her niece/nephew there (either literally or metaphorically depending on when your baby is born). I'm so sorry that you have to deal with this kind of bs.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t stop living your life because someone else is getting married.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been trying for years. If you\u2019ve been unsuccessful for that long, you don\u2019t just stop trying for a year because your sister\u2019s wedding.", "Nta\n\nIt sucks and I see why your sister is mildly put off but you can\u2019t expect someone to pause their life for you. Getting pregnant is a full time effort, and you can\u2019t miss windows of opportunity when it\u2019s something you decide on.\n\nShe needs to realize you\u2019ll do everything you can, but needs a backup plan.", "NTA, you do not have to plan your family around other people's events.  It's unfortunate that the timing worked out how it did, but you should never have to delay your pregnancies for someone else, ESPECIALLY when dealing with infertility.", "NTA.  Sometimes two good things happen close together in time.  Tell sister to let it go.  You might reconsider MoH duty though, because the timing might make helping bride out quite a burden.", "NTA.  Nature works on its own time, regardless of who it's affecting.  Congrats on the new human!", "NTA. Life doesn\u2019t come to a halt for a wedding. I\u2019ll be hopefully pregnant at my sister\u2019s wedding in addition to being MOH.", "NTA. Pregnancies aren\u2019t easy to plan and rarely come on a schedule. You had been trying. \n\nI remember people laughing so hard when I told them I was planning a baby to coincide maternity leave with finishing school and my student loans being deferred. They laughed for days and days.", "NTA why didn\u2019t she wait to have her wedding until you had a baby? /s", "NTA\n\nYour life does not revolve around her wedding. That\u2019s not how this works.", "NAH - her previous expectations for this wedding probably won't be met exactly, but that's normal for big events. It's okay that she wanted this to be her moment to shine, but it's also okay that you got pregnant. She'll probably calm down soon. Congrats to you and your sister!", "NTA... OMG your sister is a real piece of work.\n\nFor one the wedding is a ways away, your sitter might get dumpped before then making it all a moot point.\n\nbut if by some miricle someone still wants to marry this entiles self centered mess, people who are invited or participating should hold off having sex, living thier life, and having babies if you are so lucky.\n\nJust back out of being a brides maid since its bound to stress you out and cause drama...you sister can always reschedule.", "\u201cShe thinks we should have delayed trying because of her wedding as now the focus is going to be shifted to the first baby of the generation instead of the second wedding of our generation\u2026\u201d\n\nYour sister is a menace.

She was 8 months along at my wedding. I just exchanged the bridesmaids dresses for a more \"forgiving\" style that fit all the body sizes and got her a bigger size.

I'm sorry to your sister but she can't just claim a huge amount of time and be like \"no one else in the family can have anything happen to them during these weeks/months\". A wedding is supposed to be about celebrating your love not the attention you get from others. I get that this isn't ideal but you can't put your life on hold to prioritize her life and shouldn't be expected to.

I sympathize with your sister a little bit mostly I just don't get it.", "NTA.

My brother and SIL decided to drive several hours to where I lived so she could attend this occasion as her first official outing. It was absolutely incredible. \n\nThe ceremony is of course boring af but the culture there is pretty chill so a lot of grads had their kids or partners or parents come down to the floor where we were sitting to get pics with their loved ones who were graduating. My brother and my niece came down, and since I was at the end of a row, my brother just squatted down next to my seat while I bounced my 8-week-old baby niece on my lap for most of the boring shit. It was one of the best moments of my life.\n\nEven better, when word got around that my brother and SIL and new baby were going to be there, a lot more family members decided that they would come too so I got to have my favorite aunt and my favorite cousins at my graduation. It wasn't local to any of them and about half of the attendees had to fly. It was incredible. We had a big party at my house after the ceremony and everyone had a blast. \n\nThey were all super excited about the baby. They were all super excited about my graduation. It was just a really fun, joyful weekend with everyone in my family just chillin together and being happy. Which is not our natural state thanks to our collective lack of chill. Really a weekend to remember. It was 20 years ago and I still smile when I think about it. (And my now-21-year-old niece is still amazing.) \n\nAnyway, it was great and the pictures are wonderful and so are the memories.

You've been trying to have a baby for years but you're supposed to use birth control for a few months so you don't get pregnant at a time that is inconvenient for someone who should be nothing but delighted for you?
