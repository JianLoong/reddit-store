I'd suggest stepping down from MOH so that, if baby does come, you won't be messing up the wedding. It's a twist no one expected, but I would hope she is happy for you and looking forward to being an aunt!", "NTA. It really infuriates me when people like your sister get upset because their family will have two good things happen in one year. There are so many families that would give anything to have one piece of good news. I know many families that have endured back to back tragedies and for many   of them it feels like every time their phone rings, there\u2019s bad news on the other end. Your sister needs to stop being a short sighted brat and be grateful that she and her sister are both well and thriving in their individual lives.", "How dare you not put your entire life on hold for a year while your sister has a party!\n\nNTA", "Your sister is getting mad at you for having sex a few months ago and you didn\u2019t stop to think about her wedding.  You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. \n\nIf she is that bothered, then she could postpone the wedding a bit.\n\nIts not like you can postpone giving birth!\n\nYou have nothing whatsoever to feel guilty about. Dont beat yourself up about it.\n\nYou have been trying for years and now you have succeeded. Imo a wedding is unimportant in comparison. \n\nCongratulations btw and I wish you the best of luck with the pregnancy", "NTA she doesn't dictate your sex life. Just step down from being MOH.", "NTA you say you have been trying for a while so clearly has not been an easy journey.\nI get concerns around perhaps missing it as you say but it\u2019s now something out of your hands.

Nothing was happening!\n\nDitch the guilt, sistah. This is all joy. Embrace it. Surely your family has the bandwidth to be happy about a baby and a wedding AT YHE SAME TIME!!!\n\nReally, your sister should be feeling nothing but joy for you right now. You\u2019re both having an epic, life-changing February. Celebrate!", "NTA congratulations! Your sister is being selfish. Hopefully she realises that soon and starts being happy for you. \n\nWill you bow out of MOH duties?", "NTA.  Congrats!  I\u2019m actually sort of in the same boat, so I\u2019m a little bias.  Nature will find a way.  And when you\u2019re having trouble conceiving, \u201cjust waiting\u201d is another precious egg possibly going to waste.  Surely you have a due date?  Perhaps, assuming the baby is born before the wedding and you\u2019re still willing to participate, leave the baby with someone at home, probably wouldn\u2019t want a newborn exposed to sooo many new people and possible germs (I\u2019m thinking cold sores, oh the sad, sad stories) their immunity is not ready to handle.", "Both my sisters (one my MOH and one a bridesmaid were both like 8 months pregnant at my wedding).

Step down as her MOH. Don\u2019t let her make you feel bad for expanding your family. I swear brides are so self centered sometimes.", "NTA. What is it with people who think everyone else should put their lives on hold because they are getting married. Can't be pregnant, can't wear an engagement ring, can't share your joy. I remember when these things actually added to the joy of occasions.", "NAH - it\u2019s fine that she feels a little shaken up, she had a vision for her day and now she\u2019s not going to get quite what she thought she would. Her expectations and reality are no longer meeting and that does suck. This doesn\u2019t make you an AH for getting pregnant though. Hopefully she\u2019ll shake off the mojo and be happy for you and excited that she\u2019s soon to be an aunt. If she starts to be an AH about a situation that\u2019s frankly a bit outside of your control given your difficulties conceiving, then that\u2019s a whole other thing.

The world does not revolve around her wedding.", "NTA. You don't control when you become pregnant. It happens when it is meant to happen. Due dates are only approximate times of delivery, but your baby can be delivered either before or after the due date. If she is so concerned about you not fulfilling the role of the maid of honor, then your sister should ask someone else. I hope your sister will realize how absurd she is being, and let it go. She is being ridiculous.", "Really? WTF?!   \n\n\nThe most narcissist accusation I\u2019ve ever heard. Many, many bridesmaids have appeared in maternity dresses. To turn a celebration into this is inexcusable.", "NTA If your sister truly cared about you she would be very excited that after years of trying it has finally happened. Focus on your new family.", "NTA. Your sister is being dumb AF if she's surprised her married sister who she knows is actively trying for a baby is, uh, pregnant.   \nAlso, honestly, she should be happy for you instead of being focused on what is, after all, just a big goddamn party.", "NTA. Your sister is suffering from Main Character Syndrome. Tell her that if she can't be happy for you and celebrate something that you've been wishing for years and it finally happened, then you can't be there to celebrate her big moment either. Seriously, who is so deluded as to expect people to plan things such as pregnancies around their wedding? Especially knowing how long you've been trying.", "NTA. She knew you were trying when she asked so she knew it was a possibility. \n\nBut you should step down as Moh. Giving the timing you most likely won\u2019t be able to fulfill your duties or participate in much of the \u2018to do\u2019 around pree wedding stuff.", "NTA, you can't always plan parenthood. Enjoy!", "NAH. I get that your sister wants her day to be about her, but you can\u2019t put your own life on hold for six months.\n\nPlease don\u2019t feel guilty.\n\nCongrats on the pregnancy!", "NTA for getting pregnant, of course. However, if the two events really are that close together, you should really step down from MOH.", "Congrats on the baby! But NTA at all. I'm honestly astounded by the number of posts here that talk about brides who expect ppl close to them to put their lives on hold for the upcoming weddings. Idk what it is about weddings that seem to inflate their egos so much. I get it, it's a big day and they wanna be the centre of attention, look amazing etc, but wtf. Expecting you to wait another 9 months before trying for a baby is so stupid. Especially given that she knows you've been trying for so long without any success. \n\nIf I was you, I'd just tell her to choose another MOH so you can just attend as a guest. Tbh, reading this made me so angry that I probably wouldn't even attend the wedding at all. What she said to you is f'ed up. Weddings are about celebrating with the ppl that you love, not about demanding everyone to do everything your way. If anything, she should be excited that she's gonna be an aunt and will have her niece/nephew there (either literally or metaphorically depending on when your baby is born). I'm so sorry that you have to deal with this kind of bs.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t stop living your life because someone else is getting married.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been trying for years.

Getting pregnant is a full time effort, and you can\u2019t miss windows of opportunity when it\u2019s something you decide on.\n\nShe needs to realize you\u2019ll do everything you can, but needs a backup plan.", "NTA, you do not have to plan your family around other people's events.  It's unfortunate that the timing worked out how it did, but you should never have to delay your pregnancies for someone else, ESPECIALLY when dealing with infertility.", "NTA.  Sometimes two good things happen close together in time.  Tell sister to let it go.  You might reconsider MoH duty though, because the timing might make helping bride out quite a burden.", "NTA.  Nature works on its own time, regardless of who it's affecting.  Congrats on the new human!", "NTA. Life doesn\u2019t come to a halt for a wedding. I\u2019ll be hopefully pregnant at my sister\u2019s wedding in addition to being MOH.", "NTA. Pregnancies aren\u2019t easy to plan and rarely come on a schedule. You had been trying. \n\nI remember people laughing so hard when I told them I was planning a baby to coincide maternity leave with finishing school and my student loans being deferred. They laughed for days and days.", "NTA why didn\u2019t she wait to have her wedding until you had a baby? /s", "NTA\n\nYour life does not revolve around her wedding. That\u2019s not how this works.", "NAH - her previous expectations for this wedding probably won't be met exactly, but that's normal for big events. It's okay that she wanted this to be her moment to shine, but it's also okay that you got pregnant. She'll probably calm down soon. Congrats to you and your sister!", "NTA... OMG your sister is a real piece of work.\n\nFor one the wedding is a ways away, your sitter might get dumpped before then making it all a moot point.\n\nbut if by some miricle someone still wants to marry this entiles self centered mess, people who are invited or participating should hold off having sex, living thier life, and having babies if you are so lucky.\n\nJust back out of being a brides maid since its bound to stress you out and cause drama...you sister can always reschedule.", "\u201cShe thinks we should have delayed trying because of her wedding as now the focus is going to be shifted to the first baby of the generation instead of the second wedding of our generation\u2026\u201d\n\nYour sister is a menace.

A wedding is supposed to be about celebrating your love not the attention you get from others.

My brother and my niece came down, and since I was at the end of a row, my brother just squatted down next to my seat while I bounced my 8-week-old baby niece on my lap for most of the boring shit.

It wasn't local to any of them and about half of the attendees had to fly. It was incredible. We had a big party at my house after the ceremony and everyone had a blast. \n\nThey were all super excited about the baby. They were all super excited about my graduation. It was just a really fun, joyful weekend with everyone in my family just chillin together and being happy. Which is not our natural state thanks to our collective lack of chill.

It's unfortunate timing but this is a wonderful thing and it is utterly unfair of her to make you feel bad about something so special. It's not fair for her to ruin this really important and irreplaceable moment for you or the rest of the family. You can sympathise with her disappointment but that's all she gets. She is to stop burdening you with this because what's done is done and you don't deserve to be made to feel shitty at what should be the happiest moment of your life.

I thought my grandad would be disappointed because he had been so so so desperate for a holiday since COVID cancelled his more than once. But he was over the moon too. You can't miss chances to get pregnant because of events - as you well know it's not just a case of skipping a few months and then getting pregnant at a more convenient time. If you hadn't got pregnant when you did it might have taken another few years. And yes, people will be excited for you at the wedding, but it's not like you're going to be giving birth in the other room and people will choose going to that instead of the wedding!

I'll gladly come and bring presents and be happy for you.", "Has it not yet happened?\n\nWait.\n\nYou will become a member of the invisible generation immediately, whether the child is yours or not.\n\nNo extended will ever really care about anything you, or your siblings ever accomplish again.\n\nThey will make polite noises. But their pupils will dilate at the thought of a new baby, and that first baby will be what they imprint on most strongly.", "No need to wait, I am 45, and the first baby of my generation about 27. Nope, it didn't happen. Heck, it didn't even happen with my parents when my sister gave them their first and only grandchild a couple of years ago. Sounds like we have a hereditary superpower to be able to care about more than one person at a time. Go figure.", "Not a baby family?\n\nI am the much youngest.\n\nNo one gets super excited about babies 6,7,8, etc. Happy, sure. But how many showers have you been to for baby number 3?\n\nShoot, how many baby albums have you ever seen for baby number3?\n\nI think at some point all younger sibs have to accept they will always get just a little bit less fr their family.", "Yeah, not really. Big greek family, very children-oriented, just not to the exclusion of everyone else. Showers and baby albums aren't really a thing here, or at least they weren't for my generation. And each baby gets its own attention, heck my niece is the youngest and everyone dotes on her.", "NTA.\n\nLife happens even when weddings are planned. Now if we could all just schedule pregnancies perfectly, we would, but it doesn\u2019t work like that.\n\nIf your sister thinks it\u2019s reasonable to expect others not to have sex in the 9 months prior to her wedding because they\u2019re in the wedding party, then she better be abstaining as well. But even if she is, it\u2019s still not a reasonable expectation.", "NAH.  She\u2019s entitled to feel the way she feels & to replace you as MOH if she wants to.  You\u2019re entitled to have kids whenever you want to!  Congrats!", "NTA but your sister sure is. Love and excitement aren't limited and your family will have plenty of both to go around if and when your child is born around the same time as her wedding. Its not a zero sum game.", "Congrats! NTA, life happens, your sister should be happy for you", "Are you supposed to put your life on hold for a party one year away?  Does that sound reasonable to you?  NTA.", "Congratulations on your pregnancy. Don\u2019t really understand why this would be a problem apart from the chance of going into labour \u2026.. it might work out alright but can be a normal bridesmaid and have someone else be MOH?", "NTA - how dare your life plan affect what dress you wear on 1 day in her life !", "NTA. \n\nMan, wedding culture has gotten so out of hand in some ways. We got married like 15 years ago and the event was neatly bracketed by the birth of the first grandchildren on both sides (my sister gave birth six weeks before; my wife's brother became a dad two weeks after). Guests were perfectly able to spare a minute or two to go \"aww\" at the baby or congratulate the expecting parents and then refocus on the main party. It's not a problem unless you make it a problem.\n\n(Now those babies are huge teenagers, how did that happen?)", "NAH. It'a fair for your sister to get a little rattled, especially with your comment about how you got your dream wedding, and maybe she was just wishing for the same. A bride has a million things going on in her head whenever she's planning a wedding, so it's understandable that maybe she hasn't had the mental space to be rational about everything. \n\nThat being said, congratulations! Of course you're not TA for getting pregnant. I'm sure it's been a lot of emotional stress on you and your partner's end as well, and in the end everyone will be happy for you AND your sister. This will blow over and I wish both you and your sister the very best.\n\nAlso, all you people here saying that big weddings are so wasteful and useless anyway and that no one is actually paying attention to the couple all the time and who cares the sister is a weirdo and should absolutely have no feelings at all during this emotional time are so strange. People plan things and want them to go a certain way, whether that's a baby or a wedding and we should give each other a bit more grace to work through our feelings when things get changed, instead of automatically thinking the worst of someone.", "Are you effing serious?! No, really, are you effing serious? I'd be so tickled my sister finally got pregnant and is gonna be a mom! Screw it if she can't make it or is about to pop! It's for the best reason ever! And I'm going to get to be an auntie too?! Your sister is something else. Something very selfish too. I can't believe someone's own sister would be like, waah me bc my sister finally had her dream come true bc she might inconvenience my wedding a tad. Oh effing well! Try growing up a little and thinking of someone besides yourself. Try it. You might like it. I know peeps will like you better for sure!", "NTA. Life happens and if your sister has a problem with that then it reflects on her insecurities. Your family should be happy for you since you've had trouble conceiving in the past, not guilt tripping you over it. I agree with others that you may want to consider dropping out at MOH but don't feel guilty about this at all. Congratulations!", "NTA. Your sister needs to get a better grip on reality. Congratulations!! \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA and congratulations on your pregnancy! \n\nYour sister is being very self absorbed and insecure imo and should calm down. It\u2019s not like you planned it! \n\nI was MOH for my bestie ( who has had multiple miscarriages and a stillborn due to her fertility issues)  and she asked me before I got pregnant. She never displayed any resentful behaviour and was completely supportive of me and my husband who was the best man! I had a c section 8 weeks before the wedding, threw her an amazing hen do 5 weeks PP and was still her MOH on the day. I arranged childcare from the time my husband was due to be at the ceremony and my daughter was welcomed throughout the whole day. She did not take \u201cthe spotlight\u201d in any way shape or form. \n\nI suggest offering to step down as MOH. As you\u2019re due date will be on or around the date of the wedding you will either be heavily pregnant and absolutely exhausted or have a newborn which means you would much rather be at home with them (trust me!) Choose yourself and your family. \n\nBest of luck with your pregnancy OP \u2764\ufe0f", "I don't even know how to respond to that", "NTA. You never know when trying for a baby will succeed so you can't delay when you're ready. Her wedding will still be her say, there will just be other brilliant stuff happening too. She needs to grow up.", "NTA. The world doesn\u2019t stop just because your sister is getting married, and you didn\u2019t choose the timing of your pregnancy. It happened when it happened. I\u2019m sure you would have much preferred that it happened sooner, and that you would also rather not miss your sister\u2019s wedding to be in labour if you could avoid it. \n\nYour sister can arrange for a backup MOH in the event that you can\u2019t attend, but at some point she needs to accept that shit happens and not everything can go exactly how you imagined it, not even your wedding.", "When I read wedding stories on AITA, I literally feel better about myself. Looking at this 99% of people in the world are freaking narcissists. World doesn\u2019t stop because someone is getting married. Your wedding maybe at this point most important day of your life, but it\u2019s just a Saturday for rest of people attending.\n\nWhy can\u2019t OP\u2019s sister think about it as a chance to celebrate both the pregnancy and the love she has with her spouse ?", "At my wedding: Maid of honour was pregnant, my SIL had her 2 week old baby with her and another bridesmaid was pregnant but only found out a few days later! Honestly it didn\u2019t really occur to me that the spotlight wasn\u2019t on me - I think it still was, but on reflection there was a lot of baby cuddling going on!", "You getting pregnant is such a blessing. Her getting married is too. If anything this is a blessed year for your family. There isn\u2019t a limitation to how much excitement we can have for people. I\u2019d be fucking GASSED if something amazing was happening for my loved ones at the same time as something amazing happening for me.", "Congratulations, She needs to understand life goes on, yes it may disrupt her plans, but a wedding (while being a fabulous event) should be more about the love and commitment of the bride and groom. And less about whether it's a focal point of everyone's attention Too many couples get caught up in the pomp and circumstance and lose basic civility because something might distract from their \"moment\" \ud83d\ude13", "You can tell your sister that she can\u2019t expect her family to put their lives on hold so she can book a whole year to herself.", "It is possible to be excited and joyful for 2 situations at the same time\n\nWeddings aren\u2019t spent speaking to the bride and groom the whole time? You won\u2019t steal any focus from her\n\nThe only reason focus is being stolen from her is because she is manifesting it so", "Awww, you mean she might have to share some attention? What a bummer. \ud83d\ude44", "Okay but you didn\u2019t plan this on purpose so you can\u2019t blame yourself, especially since you\u2019ve been trying for a while.", "You are NTA but would it be an idea to get the extended family together once before her wedding? That way they could get it 'out of their system' and get used to seeing you pregnant.", "\"and really try to be as unobtrusive as possible that day\"\n\nI really do not understand the mentality that everyone else needs to make themselves smaller and put their lives on hold for months just because someone is having a wedding. It's such toxic thinking.", "From what you\u2019re describing in your family\u2019s dynamic, I can see why you\u2019d feel this way. But I feel like it\u2019s important to work through that with a therapist and not to impose \u201cmaking yourself smaller\u201d onto a loved one just because it was done to you.", "I just think people drastically overestimate the amount of attention people earnestly give during these events. Not to say people DONT give attention but if it\u2019s genuine, it\u2019s also pretty fleeting. And thats not bad. \n\nThe guests will be engrossed and emotional during the ceremony and first dance and moments like that and then they\u2019ll go back to their usual trains of thought. Usually about themselves. \n\nWhen they encounter the pregnant OP they\u2019ll feel excitement and congratulate her and then\u2026.they\u2019ll return to their usual train of thought. \n\nIf I got a email announcement like that I\u2019d think these two sisters are fighting for who can be more embarrassingly self centered. \n\nI don\u2019t need an email reminder to give a bride attention on her wedding day.", "Haha yes! I wish I could give you 1000 upvotes.", "It\u2019s ok to be excited, but demanding everyone\u2019s lives to stop because you are getting married is an insane, egotistical behaviour.\n\nI love weddings; every wedding I have been to was big and fun, that\u2019s a culture where I live. Starts in the afternoon on Saturday and it\u2019s a two day celebration. But when someone says - don\u2019t do this or that, because you will overshadow me, I question their motives for getting married.\n\nOP\u2019s sister missed her chance to make it an event to celebrate their whole family, because she thinks world should stop when she says so.", "Can I join your family? Please? I promise to be good and joyful!", "Nah, weddings are about celebration. What I don't get is why some people are so convinced that it's impossible to celebrate more than one thing at once. I'd be so thrilled if I could combine a wedding with welcoming a new baby or whatever.", "I had a (pretty small) wedding because I wanted to have a nice party for all my friends. If I'd thought the whole thing was going to be about everyone paying attention to me all night I would indeed have just gone to the courthouse."]}
