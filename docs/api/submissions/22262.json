I'd suggest stepping down from MOH so that, if baby does come, you won't be messing up the wedding. It's a twist no one expected, but I would hope she is happy for you and looking forward to being an aunt!", "NTA. It really infuriates me when people like your sister get upset because their family will have two good things happen in one year. There are so many families that would give anything to have one piece of good news. I know many families that have endured back to back tragedies and for many   of them it feels like every time their phone rings, there\u2019s bad news on the other end. Your sister needs to stop being a short sighted brat and be grateful that both she and her sister are both well and thriving in their individual lives.", "How dare you not put your entire life on hold for a year while your sister has a party!\n\nNTA", "Your sister is getting mad at you for having sex a few months ago and you didn\u2019t stop to think about her wedding.  You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. \n\nIf she is that bothered, then she could postpone the wedding a bit.\n\nIts not like you can postpone giving birth!\n\nYou have nothing whatsoever to feel guilty about. Dont beat yourself up about it.\n\nYou have been trying for years and now you have succeeded. Imo a wedding is unimportant in comparison. \n\nCongratulations btw and I wish you the best of luck with the pregnancy", "NTA she doesn't dictate your sex life. Just step down from being MOH.", "NTA you say you have been trying for a while so clearly has not been an easy journey.\nI get concerns around perhaps missing it as you say but it\u2019s now something out of your hands.

Nothing was happening!\n\nDitch the guilt, sistah. This is all joy. Embrace it. Surely your family has the bandwidth to be happy about a baby and a wedding AT YHE SAME TIME!!!\n\nReally, your sister should be feeling nothing but joy for you right now. You\u2019re both having an epic, life-changing February. Celebrate!", "NTA congratulations! Your sister is being selfish. Hopefully she realises that soon and starts being happy for you. \n\nWill you bow out of MOH duties?", "NTA.  Congrats!  I\u2019m actually sort of in the same boat, so I\u2019m a little bias.  Nature will find a way.  And when you\u2019re having trouble conceiving, \u201cjust waiting\u201d is another precious egg possibly going to waste.  Surely you have a due date?  Perhaps, assuming the baby is born before the wedding and you\u2019re still willing to participate, leave the baby with someone at home, probably wouldn\u2019t want a newborn exposed to sooo many new people and possible germs (I\u2019m thinking cold sores, oh the sad, sad stories) their immunity is not ready to handle.", "Both my sisters (one my MOH and one a bridesmaid were both like 8 months pregnant at my wedding).

Step down as her MOH. Don\u2019t let her make you feel bad for expanding your family. I swear brides are so self centered sometimes.", "NTA. What is it with people who think everyone else should put their lives on hold because they are getting married. Can't be pregnant, can't wear an engagement ring, can't share your joy. I remember when these things actually added to the joy of occasions.", "NAH - it\u2019s fine that she feels a little shaken up, she had a vision for her day and now she\u2019s not going to get quite what she thought she would. Her expectations and reality are no longer meeting and that does suck. This doesn\u2019t make you an AH for getting pregnant though. Hopefully she\u2019ll shake off the mojo and be happy for you and excited that she\u2019s soon to be an aunt. If she starts to be an AH about a situation that\u2019s frankly a bit outside of your control given your difficulties conceiving, then that\u2019s a whole other thing.

The world does not revolve around her wedding.", "NTA. You don't control when you become pregnant. It happens when it is meant to happen. Due dates are only approximate times of delivery, but your baby can be delivered either before or after the due date. If she is so concerned about you not fulfilling the role of the maid of honor, then your sister should ask someone else. I hope your sister will realize how absurd she is being, and let it go. She is being ridiculous.", "Really? WTF?!   \n\n\nThe most narcissist accusation I\u2019ve ever heard. Many, many bridesmaids have appeared in maternity dresses. To turn a celebration into this is inexcusable.", "NTA If your sister truly cared about you she would be very excited that after years of trying it has finally happened. Focus on your new family.", "NTA. Your sister is being dumb AF if she's surprised her married sister who she knows is actively trying for a baby is, uh, pregnant.   \nAlso, honestly, she should be happy for you instead of being focused on what is, after all, just a big goddamn party.", "NTA. Your sister is suffering from Main Character Syndrome. Tell her that if she can't be happy for you and celebrate something that you've been wishing for years and it finally happened, then you can't be there to celebrate her big moment either. Seriously, who is so deluded as to expect people to plan things such as pregnancies around their wedding? Especially knowing how long you've been trying.", "NTA. She knew you were trying when she asked so she knew it was a possibility. \n\nBut you should step down as Moh. Giving the timing you most likely won\u2019t be able to fulfill your duties or participate in much of the \u2018to do\u2019 around pree wedding stuff.", "NTA, you can't always plan parenthood. Enjoy!", "NAH. I get that your sister wants her day to be about her, but you can\u2019t put your own life on hold for six months.\n\nPlease don\u2019t feel guilty.\n\nCongrats on the pregnancy!", "NTA for getting pregnant, of course. However, if the two events really are that close together, you should really step down from MOH.", "Congrats on the baby! But NTA at all. I'm honestly astounded by the number of posts here that talk about brides who expect ppl close to them to put their lives on hold for the upcoming weddings. Idk what it is about weddings that seem to inflate their egos so much. I get it, it's a big day and they wanna be the centre of attention, look amazing etc, but wtf. Expecting you to wait another 9 months before trying for a baby is so stupid. Especially given that she knows you've been trying for so long without any success. \n\nIf I was you, I'd just tell her to choose another MOH so you can just attend as a guest. Tbh, reading this made me so angry that I probably wouldn't even attend the wedding at all. What she said to you is f'ed up. Weddings are about celebrating with the ppl that you love, not about demanding everyone to do everything your way. If anything, she should be excited that she's gonna be an aunt and will have her niece/nephew there (either literally or metaphorically depending on when your baby is born). I'm so sorry that you have to deal with this kind of bs.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t stop living your life because someone else is getting married.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been trying for years. If you\u2019ve been unsuccessful for that long, you don\u2019t just stop trying for a year because your sister\u2019s wedding.", "Nta\n\nIt sucks and I see why your sister is mildly put off but you can\u2019t expect someone to pause their life for you. Getting pregnant is a full time effort, and you can\u2019t miss windows of opportunity when it\u2019s something you decide on.\n\nShe needs to realize you\u2019ll do everything you can, but needs a backup plan.", "NTA, you do not have to plan your family around other people's events.  It's unfortunate that the timing worked out how it did, but you should never have to delay your pregnancies for someone else, ESPECIALLY when dealing with infertility.", "NTA.  Sometimes two good things happen close together in time.  Tell sister to let it go.  You might reconsider MoH duty though, because the timing might make helping bride out quite a burden.", "NTA.  Nature works on its own time, regardless of who it's affecting.  Congrats on the new human!", "NTA. Life doesn\u2019t come to a halt for a wedding. I\u2019ll be hopefully pregnant at my sister\u2019s wedding in addition to being MOH.", "NTA. Pregnancies aren\u2019t easy to plan and rarely come on a schedule. You had been trying. \n\nI remember people laughing so hard when I told them I was planning a baby to coincide maternity leave with finishing school and my student loans being deferred. They laughed for days and days.", "NTA why didn\u2019t she wait to have her wedding until you had a baby? /s", "NTA\n\nYour life does not revolve around her wedding. That\u2019s not how this works.", "NAH - her previous expectations for this wedding probably won't be met exactly, but that's normal for big events. It's okay that she wanted this to be her moment to shine, but it's also okay that you got pregnant. She'll probably calm down soon. Congrats to you and your sister!", "NTA... OMG your sister is a real piece of work.\n\nFor one the wedding is a ways away, your sitter might get dumpped before then making it all a moot point.\n\nbut if by some miricle someone still wants to marry this entiles self centered mess, people who are invited or participating should hold off having sex, living thier life, and having babies if you are so lucky.\n\nJust back out of being a brides maid since its bound to stress you out and cause drama...you sister can always reschedule.", "\u201cShe thinks we should have delayed trying because of her wedding as now the focus is going to be shifted to the first baby of the generation instead of the second wedding of our generation\u2026\u201d\n\nYour sister is a menace.

A wedding is supposed to be about celebrating your love not the attention you get from others.

It was absolutely incredible. \n\nThe ceremony is of course boring af but the culture there is pretty chill so a lot of grads had their kids or partners or parents come down to the floor where we were sitting to get pics with their loved ones who were graduating. My brother and my niece came down, and since I was at the end of a row, my brother just squatted down next to my seat while I bounced my 8-week-old baby niece on my lap for most of the boring shit.

It wasn't local to any of them and about half of the attendees had to fly. It was incredible. We had a big party at my house after the ceremony and everyone had a blast. \n\nThey were all super excited about the baby. They were all super excited about my graduation. It was just a really fun, joyful weekend with everyone in my family just chillin together and being happy. Which is not our natural state thanks to our collective lack of chill.

Congratulations on your pregnancy!", "NTA. Omg. It\u2019s your body, she can\u2019t police you for getting pregnant.", "She needs to get over herself. I was six months pregnant in my sister's wedding, and it wasn't an issue. \n\nWTF is it with these bridezillas?", "NTA and congratulations!  As someone who's also pregnant after trying for years, you really can't control these things and it's unreasonable as hell for her to have expected you to stop trying.  Even if you hadn't been trying for years, it's your body, your choice, your life.", "NTA.\n\nSo let me get this straight: according to your sister, you and your husband should have... lived like members of the clergy for... say, six months in order to ensure you couldn't possibly be pregnant enough to interfere with her wedding plans? Or have had the child, and ergo not be able to attend without the baby?\n\nI've heard of bridezillas, but jesus. This takes the cake.", "NTA congrats on pregnancy but you need to tell your sister that you have to step down from maid of honour duty asap so she can find other to do this job.", "NTA... congratulations!\n\nIt is good news at any time. You can step down as MOH so that there is less chance of disruption of the wedding party. But other them that, cant see a problem here", "NTA. I was in this exact same situation with my sister. The thing is, I think she always felt like she was living in my shadow (I am 6 years older than her), but on her wedding day, she got to be the beautiful bride and I was the frumpy bridesmaid waddling down the aisle. \ud83d\ude02 There was really no attention on me at all. People know who the star of the show is at a wedding. Don\u2019t make a big deal of it at her wedding events and no one else will either.", "There\u2019s something really wrong with the world if you feel bad for being pregnant. Her wedding is an event. Your pregnancy is you and your life. Anyone who would even make a negative comment is wrong and not thinking clearly.", "Something you really need to think about is if you\u2019ll want your mother with you, if you give birth on or around her wedding date assuming she doesn\u2019t change it. Because one if not the main problem with story\u2019s like yours is that one or both parents are with the pregnant sister on the other sister/sibling wedding day.NTA", "NTA don\u2019t put your life on hold for someone else\u2019s event. It sucks how it worked out but life is messy", "NTA.  You had no luck for years so there was no reason to expect a different result on the happy day that your luck changed!  Tell her your sorry that it worked out this way and that you'll step aside as MOH if that's what she wants you to do.  If so, then do so graciously.", "Here's the thing; you ARE pregnant. She can waste time being mad about it if she wants to but you shouldn't let it affect you. It's not like you made a decision for this exact timeline. It's not like you can change anything either. \n\nSit her down and explain that. There's absolutely no value in her being mad. It's unfortunate timing but this is a wonderful thing and it is utterly unfair of her to make you feel bad about something so special. It's not fair for her to ruin this really important and irreplaceable moment for you or the rest of the family. You can sympathise with her disappointment but that's all she gets. She is to stop burdening you with this because what's done is done and you don't deserve to be made to feel shitty at what should be the happiest moment of your life. If she can't be happy for you, and show it, then you'll have to step back from spending time with her. Or she can choose to share this joy with you while you share her joy in the run up to her wedding. Her choice.\n\nLay it out for her and create a firm boundary before the stress starts causing problems.\n\nNTA", "My sister was pregnant and showing at our wedding. We still point to the bump in the pictures and tell our niece \u201cthat\u2019s you! You were at our wedding!\u201d \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Congrats on your pregnancy! A lot can happen in a year and it's unreasonable to put your life on hold for one wedding day. I was in my friend's wedding recently, at 32 weeks of pregnancy. I got pregnant after her wedding date was scheduled. She was upset that I may or may not make it to her wedding and suggested I should've waited to get pregnant. Such a suggestion is almost friendship-ending.", "Nta,  although you should volunteer to step down as MOH,  and truthfully I think you should still pay/organize as if you are MOH", "Congratulations. NTA. I was bridesmaid at my sister's wedding in January with a three week old baby who arrived two weeks early. The day is about them. The baby won't take away the attention of the guests. Keep your baby in their capsule, they'll sleep the whole time probably. I would step down from MOH but still be in the bridal party. Is that something you could suggest to your sister?", "NTA. Expecting you to put your life on hold for a year for her wedding is ridiculous. Weddings really bring out the whacky in some people huh?", "NTA, she knew y\u2019all wanted a bub (congrats!!!!) and here\u2019s my two cents. My SIL had her VERY preggo older sis as her maid of honor and she walked down the aisle with the ring bearer and flower girl and it was probably the cutest thing ever. She just needs to remember this is a shared joy, everyone gets a look in and the more love the better \ud83e\udde1", "NTA.  Absolutely never understood this sort of drama.  Everyone's life moves at a different pace and sometimes that means more than one person in your circle of close family/friends will be having a positive major life event at the same time, and guess what?  Unless they're shitty people they'll be happy and excited for both!  Those aren't finite resources!", "You either have low self esteem and your sis is an ass or this is a joke", "NTA- you don\u2019t have to put your life on hold because your sister is getting married. I mean of course it would be great for you to be in your sister \u2018s wedding, but she should understand that you have been trying for years to have a baby and were not trying to disrupt her wedding plans. Your sister should be nothing but happy for you. Maybe she should choose a different maid of honor though and have you be a bridesmaid so that it won\u2019t be as big of a deal in case you are unable to make.", "NTA - A wedding is a special moment but people put way too much emphasis on the day, it\u2019s the marriage that really matters. She knew you were trying to have a baby and congratulations are in order! Offer to step down as the MOH so that any baby related issues won\u2019t be as impactful on her wedding day, but certainly don\u2019t feel guilty about being excited for your own baby!", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to put your life on hold for her wedding. From my experience, your wedding seems like a huge deal until it\u2019s over and then you don\u2019t really care as much\n\nCan\u2019t believe this almost slipped my mind: Our best man had his baby born the day of our wedding. Absolutely no one blamed him and we made do with one less groomsman. Someone else did the best man speech. It was really nbd", "NTA. We had to cancel a family holiday when I got pregnant because obviously me and my husband wouldn't be able to attend and my mum and dad didn't want to be away and miss meeting their first grandchild in the first few days and supporting me. We had a house booked with my sister, her boyfriend, and my grandad. I thought my grandad would be disappointed because he had been so so so desperate for a holiday since COVID cancelled his more than once. But he was over the moon too. You can't miss chances to get pregnant because of events - as you well know it's not just a case of skipping a few months and then getting pregnant at a more convenient time. If you hadn't got pregnant when you did it might have taken another few years. And yes, people will be excited for you at the wedding, but it's not like you're going to be giving birth in the other room and people will choose going to that instead of the wedding! It will suck if you can't be there but it's not the end of the world. And if she cares that much she can move the wedding. That's much easier to plan a different time than a pregnancy.", "NTA. Your life doesn\u2019t get put on hold just because you are involved in a wedding down the track. Congratulations!\nMy son was in his brother\u2019s wedding and his partner went into labor and had the baby the morning of the wedding six weeks before her due date. No one was expecting that. Babies come when they come. \n\nThe best man was all set to escort two bridesmaids when my new dad son turned up for just the ceremony and then went back to his partner and new daughter. No one expected that either, lol but it was really cool that he came and the wedding couple announced the birth at their reception.", "What is it with brides bring so desperate for attention? I just do not get it. Weddings are a celebration of the union of the couple and are for everyone to enjoy together. They are not an occasion to worship the bride and groom. All the posts about brides dictating what guests can wear and when family members are \u201callowed\u201d to be pregnant and who else can or cannot celebrate any other occasion within the month of the wedding, and so forth just make my head hurt. How can a person go through life being so insecure that they cannot tolerate anyone else living life? How do they have the energy to even try to control everyone they know???", "NTA and the best thing for you is to tell her you won't be participating in her wedding. If she gets upset, it is not your fault.", "ty for rephrasing this so accurately \n\ni will never understand bridezillas \n\nNTA, OP, and congrats!!!", "I like this answer.  NAH.", "This is the comment I was looking for!!\n\nNTA! OP, your sister\u2019s wedding and the birth of your baby are both momentous things that should be celebrated within the family! Your sister seriously sounds quite delusional, telling you, you should have waited to procreate. Like huh?! \n\nSince she wants a solo moment so bad, tell her to push the wedding date back since she\u2019s worried about her new niece/nephew stealing her shine.", "The sister's being an asshole and OP is obviously NTA, but eh...some families absolutely do zero in on a new baby over anything and everything else. I was at a wedding once, and the bride's whole family was gathered around her infant nephew for like 3/4s of the reception. It was noticeable and awkward, enough that even my boyfriend noticed, and I wasn't even that close to the bride and I could tell she was kind of upset. \n\nSo while I think OP is NTA and the sister is the asshole, not every fam is like...normal...when it comes to babies and thinks of it as two things to celebrate and instead view it as the major, only thing to celebrate.", "Dang, nearly snorted tea out of my nose when I got to the pitched a fit part!", "It\u2019s two great things happening in your families lives. Maybe instead of worrying about one thing outshining the other, you could think of it as a time of great joy for your family? It of course would be a bummer if you can\u2019t go to the wedding. But it will be something amazing happening that\u2019s why! Maybe just be happy for each other?", "I got married in my living room.  Invited like 5 people. Best wedding ever. \n\nAlso NTA op sister needs to be happy for her.", "No ma\u2019am. Since it\u2019s bothering you, maybe have an honest conversation with her where she can vent her frustrations without judgement because her fantasy/fairytale is now diminished/different. It\u2019s okay if she is disappointed, but at the end of the day, a wedding should still encapsulate real life and real life includes her cherished sister about to become a mum.\n\nI had 5 heavily pregnant people at my own wedding and 2 were my sisters-in-law both at 8+ months pregnant. I was just relieved they felt well and could participate; then it become a sweet thing to point out the belly pics and tell the nieces they attended!\n\nShe is coming across as selfish, but I think you guys can turn it around and get to a good place. Have a game plan where if people come on too strong trying to celebrate your pregnancy, you can deflect back to your her: \u201cthank you! Doesn\u2019t sister look stunning in that dress?! Ask her about her honeymoon because it sounds amazing!\u201d", "Happy Cake!  \ud83c\udf82", "My first outing was at 10 days old, to dad's 10 yr high school reunion.\n\nHe went to college on the GI bill, graduated on my 8th birthday and we had a houseful of relatives that weekend. \n\nI still had a cake and presents and he had a big party.", "My husband's mum's cousin came to our wedding and it was her birthday on the day and also her first grandchild was born during the day!! She kept giving us updates and was beaming ear-to-ear and telling everyone at the wedding. It was lovely!!! I still had more than enough attention, even if a lot of her attention was going to her new family member and the updates on her phone.", "These are the memories of a lifetime. \u2764\ufe0f"]}
