Just let her go.  If that's your experience with her I'm sure others experience the same.  Let her rant to the empty room.  Who cares?", "NTA.\n\nI don't know how close your aunt was with you and your siblings, but from personal experience relatives who show up and don't have a personal connection with the deceased tend not to be to hurt by they passing and treat the funeral as a time to reconnect with extended family, although they still do follow the correct funeral and grieving procedures, which your aunt seems to have failed to do. Which would have been her only saving grace.", "NTA. Grieve how you all see fit. Sorry for your loss", "NTA.  So sorry for the loss of your sister and the poor behavior of your aunt. It's too bad your aunt can't see how inappropriate, rude and inconsiderate her behavior is.  I would not worry about what she is posting as you all know the truth and that is all that matters.", "NTA.  She sounds horrible.  You didn't do anything wrong, but her behavior is inexcusable.", "NTA and I'm sorry for your loss. INFO: Has she always been this way? Sounds like she's on drugs as well.", "NTA. She was beyond rude and inconsiderate. She got what she deserved.", "NTA", "lol no, NTA.", "\"Am I the asshole for not bothering to hug my aunt after she was rude to me and my siblings?\"\n\nUmmmm\n\nNTA. Just know that your decision has consequences. You had the ability to give a chilly hug.\n\nBut honestly, why not make enemies in this situation?", "Esh.\nYour aunt sounds terrible BUT it doesn\u2019t sound like any of you spoke up the previous night to tell her she was acting inappropriately.   I would have told her that night that it\u2019s about your sister and if she can\u2019t behave respectfully she shouldn\u2019t be there.\nInstead you collectively shunned her at the funeral and she has no idea why.

Wish it was her funeral instead.", "We aren\u2019t that close with her at all. Only see her once every four years? Only as children from ages 3-10, we used to visit her house practically every summer. \n\nShe never liked my mom once we got older and noticed her behaviour for our mom, we stopped all contact.", "Yeah, she\u2019s always been the stern-serious aunt. \n\nI don\u2019t think she is, I think she only takes stuff for her health (diabetes, arthritis).", "In that moment (not now or ever) I only had anger and hatred for her. There was no love in my heart for her at that moment. I hated the way she treated me and my siblings that night. Plus I didn\u2019t want to make a scene at my sister\u2019s funeral.", "This is a horrible take, no one is owed affection especially someone who acts like an ah at a funeral. This is classic rug sweeping.", "I actually think the aunt knows exactly what she\u2019s doing. Notice that she\u2019s still making the funeral about herself and not her niece. I would be willing to bet she behaves like this often. I don\u2019t think OP or siblings are AHs for simply choosing not to engage with her anymore. (Plus when you confront people like that, all they do is play victim and make it even more about themselves)\n\nImo NTA", "We wanted to speak against her but we known the only things would come out were cruel plus words that shouldn\u2019t be spoken out loud. \n\nThe rest of my aunts and my dad (her brother) spoke to her the next morning about her behaviour towards us. She told them we were being dramatic.", "She's graduated from being stern to being bonkers. Ignore her - her FB rants about siblings that have just lost their sister really makes her look bad. And anyone who takes her side is equally nuts.", "Personally, I would cut her out / off completely. If someone were to ask I would tell them the truth. Otherwise, what do you gain from keeping her in your life? So sorry for your loss. NTA at all.", "NTA. You aren't the first person with auntie issues, OP, and you sure as hell won't be the last. As someone who hasn't spoken to my aunt in my life because she's that bad, I can say cut her our of your life.\n\nAlso, I'm so sorry about your sister. I hope you and your family are coping.", "NOT AN AH. I think your Aunt dismissed the fact that your family was gathering over a tragedy, wanted to show up last as if she was a prize and everyone was just going to focus on her. My family would have done the same as you. No words necessary. As for the FB thing, it's just another way she can make it all about her. In reality. Nobody on fb really gives a shit either. I think you did the right thing.", "Regardless of how close you were or weren't,  you lost a sister \ud83e\udd7a (trust me I know how that feels, my sister passed about 2 months ago) and it should have occurred to her that she was being an entitled AH in making it all about her! \nI am so sorry for your loss, and I am glad that you and your siblings have each other to comfort each other. Just forget about your aunt, she's not worth it.", "NTA \n\nI would comment on her post and say \u201cWe are all just as equally disappointed by your behavior before, during and now after our sisters funeral. We expected much more support from a full grown woman who clearly only cares about herself.\u201d", "NTA. I have an aunt who makes everything about her. It's intolerable to be around, so I just never talk to her anymore.", "NTA\n\nJust ignore her posts.\n\nShe's a jerk!", "NTA. Sounds like my mom is your aunt. I know it's hurtful but let it go. Nobody likes her and she can cry on Facebook all she wants. Only people like her will believe her.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA, and if it were me I'd reply to every whine I saw on social media with the truth.", "NTA.  She is a narcissist and has no empathy whatsoever!  Where were your parents in all this?  I would have ripped her apart and then told her to shut her mouth if she were my sister or SIL.  Your mother had to bury a child.  Your Aunt is the Ahole.", "NTA.", "I don't know where you got the impression I was saying anything about affection. Or have you never seen the type of hug Bill and Hillary Clinton give to each other?\n\nThere are many things in between greeting someone the first time you see them on a particular day with a full embrace, and what the OP actually did, which was a full ignore on the first time she saw her aunt on that particular day. The poster made a choice within her discretion.\n\nWhat I **am** saying is that if you are going to express enmity toward someone, know that the message **will** be received as an expression of enmity, and accept that it will be returned."]}
