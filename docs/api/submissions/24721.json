The guy broke up with me one day after I got home from traveling to the other side of the world to spend a week with him because his parents thought I was too fat. It was a really tough time, and it messed with me mentally quite a bit, and my friends were livid. Especially my two best friends, because they thought that we were in such a good, healthy relationship.\n\nFast forward to almost three months later, and I have moved on, and he and I haven't really spoken. But Saturday morning he and I struck up a conversation, and we were reminiscing on old times. It was sweet, but nothing came of it, and I didn't expect anything to.\n\nThat night, we were having my going away party (I'm moving to Israel in a couple of weeks). All my friends were there, my closest friend included. She (28 F) is fiercely protective of me and cares about me a lot. However, I think she went too far.\n\nI had told her that I talked to my ex that morning, and she was not pleased. So, that night at my party, I got really drunk, because it was my last American blowout with all my closest friends. Since I was so sloshed, I don't remember much of what went on that night.\n\nThe next morning, I was looking through my phone, and I noticed that my ex's profile pic was greyed out, something I know to mean someone has been blocked.\n\nSo, I clicked on his profile, and it said \"you blocked this user.\" Which I knew I wouldn't have done, but I had been pretty drunk. So, I figured that must have been the case.\n\nBut then I really got to thinking about it, and I knew that couldn't be the case.\n\nI texted my two closest friends asking if they had done it.\n\nMy best friend responded, \"lol, yeah. Tipsy me got the best of me last night.\"\n\nShe had gone in my phone and into my messages where she then blocked him. She said she was also going to delete our conversation, but decided against it.\n\nI was livid. Not because she blocked my ex, but because she took away my autonomy and invaded my privacy. And now she is mad at me for being mad at her. She is trying to play it like she was just concerned for me, but I can't imagine going into someone's phone and doing something so invasive. I said she was crazy. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I also want to say that many of my other friends and family have told me I shouldn\u2019t be upset because she was looking out for me. But I just can\u2019t shake the violating feeling of someone being in my text messages. Especially in a thread of messages where so many intimate and private details were shared from both parties. \n\nTLDR; my best friend snuck into my phone while I was drunk and blocked an ex.", "created_utc": 1692122299, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rzro2/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_was_crazy_for/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is very little I will excuse when alcohol is involved, but this would be one of them. She did something she shouldn\u2019t have done, invaded your privacy, and you have every right to be pissed\u2026 but I think you should just talk to her and have a conversation and maybe let it go. She was dumb under the influence but she didn\u2019t act on bad intentions against you.  You\u2019re leaving, don\u2019t let it end on too bad of a note, I hope you guys can smooth it over and she\u2019ll understand that boundary.

She is looking out for you.. drunk looking out but looking out.  Now shes clear on that boundry... next time is on her.", "NTA but babe you are moving to the land occupied by Israel which Palestine", "NTA - someone that \"protective\" is usually a puppet master and you didn't listen so she took control. I see it in one of my daughters friend and how she treats my daughter.", "I told her that. And it\u2019s especially a big deal because I\u2019m moving to a country where I don\u2019t have anything. No friends, no family, and he was the one connection I would have. He\u2019d agreed to be a helping hand or company if I ever needed it. And she just kind of took that away without thinking about it", "I guess that\u2019s right, I know the intention was good, but there should have been some other avenue to do it", "You\u2019re right in many ways. My only thing is that he\u2019s the only person I know in the new country I\u2019m moving to, and it\u2019s hard to cut ties with someone when they\u2019re all you may have.", "It\u2019s not about him being blocked.

Yes, she shouldn't have done it, but the intention was from the right place and she is right that blocking him is better for your health in the long run.

I'd be careful with this friend though. Not only did she sneak into your phone when you were drunk but she also didn't even tell you that she did it. She waited until you asked and then is all \"Oh, yeah, I did do that because I was *sooo* drunk, tee hee!\" Yeah, your ex sounds like an ass and I can get that your friend wouldn't want you to talk with him again but that is not her decision to make. If she was so concerned about you talking to your ex, she should have taken you somewhere you could talk and express her concerns about it. This woman is almost 30 years old and she decides that she's just going to steal your phone, block your ex and then not even tell you what she did? No. That is sneaky behaviour right there and - I'll be honest - I would really think about your friendship with her.", "She crossed a huge line in my book.  I wouldn't in a million years go through my friends phones.  Heck my wife and I don't look at each others phones.  NTAH here, block your friend...", "NTA - it was an invasion of privacy.  \nI hope your move goes well, and that you make great friends quickly - fingers crossed for you you don't need to rely on your ex.", "NTA I had a similar situation w a friend going through another friend\u2019s phone and she read a gc with the person who went through her phone ex in it and she slandered that I was trying to hook up e him", "wait youre moving to be closer to your ex?", "Do not do this to yourself!", "Girl, grow a backbone and do not communicate with him again. Have some self respect.", "I should have included some context about that. I have been planning to move to Israel for almost a year. I was only dating Israelis because I knew I\u2019d be moving and there was no point in starting a relationship with an American. So, no, my move is in no way correlated to him", "OK, but don't let the fact that you won't know anyone over there drive you back to him. You might feel lonely and he might take advantage of that. Eventually you'll meet new people and start dating again anyway."]}
