{"id": 14509, "submission_id": "12i5grj", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter that custody isn't changing?", "selftext": "When my ex-husband and I divorced three years ago, my daughter took it fairly well. She (unfortunately) understood why, so it wasn't a shock, but of course it was still a major change. Our main focus was on doing what was best for her, so we tried to involve her as much as was healthy in what the new schedule would be. We settled on a flexible 50/50 and she took it in stride. The only thing she asked was to never have any new parents or siblings. I thought it was a weird thing to ask for as neither of us were even considering dating, but she was worried to the point of hysterics about it, so we agreed. \n\nA year and a half ago, my now-husband. My daughter met him and they got along fine, she met his kids and that was fine, and she's met probably too many of her father's female guests, so I thought she'd gotten over it. I was wrong. Late last year, we got engaged and started preparing to move in together, and she lost it. She went into hysterics that I was breaking my promise. She announced that she would not be spending the night with me anymore, and demanded to live with her father 100% of the time. I told her that was ridiculous and that the schedule was not changing.\n\nHer father decided to back her, and is willing to fight it in court \"if necessary\". My lawyer says if it goes to court, it could go either way because she's over 12 years old, which is a last resort for us. \n\nI don't want this change. Her father loves her, but he's not really a responsible parent. He leaves her home alone far too much, and doesn't even try to supervise or put limits on anything. More so, my daughter is a child, and she shouldn't have the right to dictate how much she sees her parents.\n\nI know I stupidly agreed to not remarry in that moment, but that wasn't a realistic thing to promise and she has to know that. My ex is on her side and thinks she should live where she's most comfortable, and agrees with her that I'm \"being irresponsible\". I don't think it's healthy to give her that much power, especially over something that was demanded when she was all of nine years old.", "created_utc": 1681180324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12i5grj/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_custody_isnt/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter likely feels like you are choosing your fianc\u00e9 over her. Not only that,  but you've broken her trust. Go ahead and move in, but know that the damage will be hard to undo and you *are* in fact making a choice that places her second.", "YTA for making that promise instead of taking your kid to family therapy.", "YTA. As far as I can tell, you\u2019ve never had a real conversation with your daughter about her refusal to accept a new partner for her parents & her refusal to accept step siblings. Do you know why she feels this way? What is she afraid of? Why? Instead of working it out in the beginning, you made a ridiculous promise to appease her & then when you met someone, you \u201cassumed\u201d she\u2019d be fine with the change. It\u2019s time to show some respect & compassion for your daughter. Talk to her. Put the brakes on the new folks moving in until you can work something out with her & help her adjust.", "So... your kid breaks down in hysterics and *demands* that you and your ex not remarry or have children. Instead of addressing this, you agreed? What? \n\nDo you actually discuss things with her or just tell her what's going to happen? Do you prepare her for the next step? Do you broach the subject well before it happens? Or do you think there's a natural progression to this stuff that she should just follow? \n\nGo to family therapy. Get her in a safe, neutral environment where she can talk about why she's afraid of having more siblings or of you marrying. Let her express herself and talk. Until you can sort this out, let her stay with her father (as long as it's safe).\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you guys just chose the easiest route with the least amount of tantrums and tears and never took the time to stop, think, and actually discuss and address what the problem is - and it's likely a whole lot deeper than you expect. \n\nAlso, just because a kid seems to be taking things in stride, doesn't mean they are. We really need to stop just doing a cursory check over kids. If they're not acting out, that doesn't mean everything is fine and dandy. Actually regularly check in with kids and talk about their thoughts and feelings with no fear of consequences. \n\nHonestly, if my parents took more interest in my emotional health, I think things would be a whole lot different now, and I'm sure the same could be said for a lot of other people too.", "YTA  - You just want what you want. She made a clear and articulate request: No new parents or siblings and you agreed.\n\nYou still dismiss her request and at age 12 you call her a child while most family court judges would value her input and preferences.\n\nHave you ever been curious why she reacts with hysteria about the topic? It is a serious reaction and you never asked?!", "Yta. In three years, you changed her family, and now you want to change it again. She told you what she needed to be okay moving forward--no more controllable changes in her family life. You agreed.\n\nI understand you want to shape your life in the way you would like it, but you have a child to think  about. She gets a voice in how her life is shaped too.", "Listen OP, I'm not going to comment on your daughters childish demands or your impulsive promise, because I think you're missing the bigger picture here. \n\nI was your daughter about 20 years ago. I wanted to move in with my dad and my mom would not let it happen. We went to therapy about it. We fought and screamed and cried about it. I started hurting myself and more. By the time I was 15, my mom finally relented one night during a fight, calling my dad and telling him that if he wasn't there to pick me up in half an hour, the cops would be.\n\nThat phone call was 17 years ago. My father is dead. My relationship with my mother has only JUST started healing within the last 5 years or so, and even still, it is rocky. (We are currently not speaking at this very moment in time, though I am optimistic that it will get better soon.)\n\nI'm 32. I have my own daughter. While I would never want to live apart from her, the vitriolic nature of my relationship with my mother is, I think, a far worse fate for any parent and child. If you hold your daughter back when she and her father are willing to put everything on the line to change the custody arrangement (because your daughter is uncomfortable in your home), you are only going to alienate your child from you in ways that may truly be irreparable.\n\nI think that's something you seriously need to consider; the only thing worse than not having your kid home every night is having a child who cuts you out for good the moment they have the opportunity.\n\nFor now, I'm voting N A H, but YWBTA if you keep pushing your daughter away from you like this and continue to refuse to respect her wishes. She's a person too, and she's allowed to have her own thoughts, desires, and wants. Who knows. Maybe she'll go to dads and find out that the grass isn't greener.", "YTA  I think your choice is to wait til your daughter is 18 to remarry or lose her. And what do you mean \" give her power over adults\"? Shes not being unreasonable, you made a serious promise to her and now not only are you going back on your word you're willing to lose your kid over it. If you're that invested in remarriage go for it, but let your daughter move in with her father. At least she can trust him.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t promise your kid something, and then be annoyed she\u2019s upset you broke that promise. I do not think you should force her to live with anyone she doesn\u2019t want to live with. That includes the man you are screwing and you should\u2019ve known that it was important to her. It is a very valid concern and I am on her side.", "YTA.\n\nIt's almost like you made the promise just to shut her up, and now you are making her out to be the one at fault for not rolling with your punches while also invalidating her.\n\nHopefully the court actually appreciates what she says and feels, and realizes she is old enough to have some say in custody arrangements.", "So, OP, your daughter was old enough to know that you wouldn't be able to hold your promise and remarry but not old enough to have preferences to have living space preferences?\n\nAs a parent, it is your job to either honour a promise you made to your child or sit her down and explain how mommy can't promise she won't fall in love with another man and eventually move in with him. \n\nIf the father is really irresponsible at parenting (like you're saying), your lawyer would be less inclined to say \"It can go either way, she's over 12 years old\" and more inclined to say something like \"Parents who do this and that are less likely to get full custody, so there might be a chance\".\n\nYour whole post / vocabulary choice shows that you don't respect your daughter's autonomy and opinions because of her age. It's unbecoming and coupled with the fact that it really does not matter to you that you broke a promise that you made to her...is that the relationship you want with your daughter? Lies, contempt and dismissiveness? You lie about a promise to shut her up, look down upon her feelings and when you go ahead and do what you wanted, tell her it's her fault for believing you?\n\nYou want the lesson your daughter learns from you is that you will lie to her and not hold your word if it gets her to do what you want her to?\n\nBecause so far, what I get is that she was pretty much understanding of the situation (the divorce, the custody schedule). She only had one boundary. Was it a lot to ask? Sure. But you did a big parenting mistake and you're putting it on her. It's not the job of the nine year old to know and accept her mother might remarry and force the nine year old to accept a blended family. If you seemingly accepted that the nine year old could do that, then you have to accept that the twelve year old can tell a judge where she'd prefer to live. \n\nYTA, but it's not too late to fix this. It will come at great cost, though.", "YTA you made an agreement. There are plenty of divorced parents who make the decision not to date until their kids are 18. She\u2019s also old enough that a judge will likely consider her wants in a custody fight. I really believe parents have no business getting married to someone new when their child makes is clear they don\u2019t want that. Her wants matter too. You have flipped her world upside down in only 3 years and are making it clear her feelings don\u2019t matter. You shouldn\u2019t be bringing a man into her life without her consent", "YTA You made an unreasonable promise to your daughter and then assumed she should just get over it. You say she\u2019s just a child who shouldn\u2019t have a say in what happens to her but in the same breath you expect her to be mature and accepting of your misguided lie. Also, if there was any truth to your ex being an irresponsible father how come it\u2019s only now an issue? You sound self absorbed. Your lawyer is right, you should try to handle it amicably, or you might lose her completely.", "Dont make promises you cant keep babe YTA", "YTA... for making a stupid promise and then breaking it!\nShe is old enough to speak for herself. It may go her way if she expresses herself well.", "You and your ex put her through a divorce and she asked that you don\u2019t remarry. All you had to do was not remarry.

You are suppose to raise an independent adult and I don't see that happening magically in unless she is allowed to grow up. Reflect on your parenting goals. I doubt your daughter wants supervision and depending on her behaviour she doesn't really need it anymore either. \n\n\n- \"I don't think it is healthy to give her that much power\" ...

You made a promise just like everything other parent who has broken it and guess what? The world keeps on turning. Explain to her that you\u2019re not replacing her and that circumstances change. Personally, I\u2019d let her hang herself with her own rope. If her father is so keen to take her, let her AND him learn a lesson that she can\u2019t just throw a tantrum and get what she wants- you single and alone so that her precious promise is fulfilled.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She (unfortunately) understood why, so it wasn't a shock, but of course it was still a major change. Our main focus was on doing what was best for her, so we tried to involve her as much as was healthy in what the new schedule would be. We settled on a flexible 50/50 and she took it in stride. The only thing she asked was to never have any new parents or siblings. I thought it was a weird thing to ask for as neither of us were even considering dating, but she was worried to the point of hysterics about it, so we agreed. \n\nA year and a half ago, my now-husband. My daughter met him and they got along fine, she met his kids and that was fine, and she's met probably too many of her father's female guests, so I thought she'd gotten over it. I was wrong. Late last year, we got engaged and started preparing to move in together, and she lost it. She went into hysterics that I was breaking my promise. She announced that she would not be spending the night with me anymore, and demanded to live with her father 100% of the time. I told her that was ridiculous and that the schedule was not changing.\n\nHer father decided to back her, and is willing to fight it in court \"if necessary\". My lawyer says if it goes to court, it could go either way because she's over 12 years old, which is a last resort for us. \n\nI don't want this change. Her father loves her, but he's not really a responsible parent. He leaves her home alone far too much, and doesn't even try to supervise or put limits on anything. More so, my daughter is a child, and she shouldn't have the right to dictate how much she sees her parents.\n\nI know I stupidly agreed to not remarry in that moment, but that wasn't a realistic thing to promise and she has to know that. My ex is on her side and thinks she should live where she's most comfortable, and agrees with her that I'm \"being irresponsible\". I don't think it's healthy to give her that much power, especially over something that was demanded when she was all of nine years old.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When did you get divorced, when did you meet your now husband, when did you get married?", ">More so, my daughter is a child, and she shouldn't have the right to dictate how much she sees her parents.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Making a promise you can't keep is very bad practice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, she's not wrong. Step-parents and step-siblings can substantially worse the quality of life, or even endanger children. In my opinion, people remarry slightly more freely than is justified by child abuse stats.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t get to micromanage his parenting and you shouldn\u2019t be surprised that lying to your kid causes problems.  If his parenting was that bad you would have done something about it before, you only care because your daughter is upset with you to the point of wanting to leave.", "Welcome to parenting where you put what your child needs above what you want. \nYour daughter's life was turned upside down once when her whole life changed and three years later you want to do it again after promising not to. \nYour daughter is a smart girl and has probably seen enough examples of how it doesn't work in mixed families. She wanted to protect herself from this and you said to do so. You can't go back on this promise now without losing your daughter. Your daughter's request has not been strange. who would want to live with someone you don't know well, who has different norms, values \u200b\u200band rules. that is going to change the whole dynamic in your own home just because you want it to. Is your relationship with your husband more important than the relationship with your daughter?\nYou could have respected your daughters wishes and move in together when she is older. Know you just show her that she can not trust you.", "YTA\n\nThe lack of basic respect for your daughter is astounding. Why would a ten or twelve year old expect that the agreement you made wasn't a real agreement, or that of course you were going to break your word. She expressed a need and you are trampling over her now because it's what's best for you. All you've demonstrated to her is that your word does not matter. There is a whole lot of narcissism reeking out of your post about the way you speak about her and her father. \n\nYour daughter may be a child now and you may not like that she wants some boundaries, but you better be careful because once she's an adult, she definitely can set boundaries and you may not like the strong boundaries she decides to set with you.", "YTA......promises to children always come back to bite you in the butt....you have created this problem.   She will hate both of you...she doesn't want him in her \"home\".  You are telling her that she had no choices over who lives with her because she is a child.  So unless your new husband can get her on board she will resent both of you which  will result  in a difficult marriage. Because of course you will put your new husband first and delegate her to number two  in your life.", "YTA.  The demand your daughter had that you don\u2019t remarry is unreasonable, but it is the price she asked for going along with the custody plan without complaint.\n\nYou\u2019ve now realized this isn\u2019t a promise you can keep, which is fine, I guess, although you should have thought about that before.  However, in response she\u2019s telling you she\u2019s no longer going to accept the 50-50 plan, and she\u2019s old enough that her input will likely matter.  You obviously didn\u2019t engage with her enough as your relationship progressed to understand her feelings, and whether the promise was reasonable or not, you broke it.  You screwed up and should focus on repairing your relationship with your daughter rather than fighting her request.  That probably does mean a significant custody change.\n\nKeep in mind the request originated from her, not her dad.  Fighting it wholesale could end very poorly for you.\n\nSo, imagine you take it to court, fight your daughter\u2019s request, and actually win.  Is 6 years of 50-50 custody (instead of every other weekend or whatever) really worth likely alienating your daughter and making her go no contact when she\u2019s 18?  Because that\u2019s how this can end.", "YTA she was a child and you made that promise and didn\u2019t think it through!?!? What in the world? You need to stop this moving in/ marriage thing and get into therapy with her to work through this. Even if you win this battle, you will not win this war unless you go about it considering how it is making her feel and working through it with her. Jfc I can\u2019t even believe what I just read!", "YTA unfortunately. It was just a really dumb promise to make knowing it would likely be broken. What happens if her dad gets engaged though?", ">Your daughter likely feels like you are choosing your fianc\u00e9 over her.\n\nPrecisely. Given the facts described by OP, this is very much what's happening.", "this.\n\nwe remember the decisions our parents made and the effects it had on us forever", "At least OP should have sat down with her daughter for a talk before making this big of a decision imo. Explain that she made a promise at that time, but she's in love now and add the reasons she wanna marry her fiance, etc and have a conversation.\n\nI think OP doesn't consider her daughter as her own person and as a \"kid\" who doesn't know any better or whose feeling doesn't matter.\n\nOP if you continue to ignore your daughter's feelings and dismiss her, you're going to lose her", "OP also doesn\u2019t provide any details. How many kids are we talking about new husband having? Does she now have to share a room with a stranger / step sibling? How many rooms in the house? Are you planning to have more kids?\n\nYTA and your lawyer is right. She will get to choose who she lives with but the courts will likely require SOME visitation (eg at least every other weekend). Maybe not require any overnights depending on the living situation (eg sharing a room).\n\nI think it\u2019s less about no remarrying - new siblings, but more about how fast you\u2019re moving. You\u2019ve been divorced 3 years. 1.5 years ago you introduced this man to your child and now they\u2019re already moving in playing happy family? Yikes!\n\nI agree with the 12 year old here.", "Concisely put.\n\nI hope OP's ex sets up a court date asap to update the custody agreement.", "OP made an error making that promise , but for OP to exclude all men with kids is a lot to ask. After a certain age, a lot of the good ones have kids . Perhaps it would be best for OP and daughter to sit down and talk. The man she\u2019s \u201c screwing \u201c is her husband now.", "the daughter met the man and his kids a year and a half ago, decent bit before he and the mom got engaged. \n\nnot taking a side here, just pointing out that he may not necessarily be a stranger like you\u2019ve stated in your comment", "OP is gonna have quite the shocking day in court when a family law judge explains that her daughter absolutely gets a say in that.", ">You also continue to lie by saying the arrangement isn\u2019t changing when you already know the courts could go either way.\n\nThis is an important point to highlight. OP is actively telling ongoing lies to the kid in an effort to scam her into not advocating for herself.", "The grownups chose to have a child, the child did not choose. Everyone's needs comes first, but when it comes to wants, there should be deep deference towards the person who didn't volunteer for that relationship.", "It's still not appropriate for mom to bring a new adult into the house unless child is fully onboard. It's the child's living space as much as it is the mother's. If child isn't comfortable for whatever reason, mom needs to work it out. Either by keeping new man out of the house or by allowing the daughter to move to dad's."]}
