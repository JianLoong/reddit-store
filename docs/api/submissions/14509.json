{"id": 14509, "submission_id": "12i5grj", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter that custody isn't changing?", "selftext": "When my ex-husband and I divorced three years ago, my daughter took it fairly well. She (unfortunately) understood why, so it wasn't a shock, but of course it was still a major change. Our main focus was on doing what was best for her, so we tried to involve her as much as was healthy in what the new schedule would be. We settled on a flexible 50/50 and she took it in stride. The only thing she asked was to never have any new parents or siblings. I thought it was a weird thing to ask for as neither of us were even considering dating, but she was worried to the point of hysterics about it, so we agreed. \n\nA year and a half ago, my now-husband. My daughter met him and they got along fine, she met his kids and that was fine, and she's met probably too many of her father's female guests, so I thought she'd gotten over it. I was wrong. Late last year, we got engaged and started preparing to move in together, and she lost it. She went into hysterics that I was breaking my promise. She announced that she would not be spending the night with me anymore, and demanded to live with her father 100% of the time. I told her that was ridiculous and that the schedule was not changing.\n\nHer father decided to back her, and is willing to fight it in court \"if necessary\". My lawyer says if it goes to court, it could go either way because she's over 12 years old, which is a last resort for us. \n\nI don't want this change. Her father loves her, but he's not really a responsible parent. He leaves her home alone far too much, and doesn't even try to supervise or put limits on anything. More so, my daughter is a child, and she shouldn't have the right to dictate how much she sees her parents.\n\nI know I stupidly agreed to not remarry in that moment, but that wasn't a realistic thing to promise and she has to know that. My ex is on her side and thinks she should live where she's most comfortable, and agrees with her that I'm \"being irresponsible\". I don't think it's healthy to give her that much power, especially over something that was demanded when she was all of nine years old.", "created_utc": 1681180324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12i5grj/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_custody_isnt/", "score": 362, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter likely feels like you are choosing your fianc\u00e9 over her. Not only that,  but you've broken her trust. Go ahead and move in, but know that the damage will be hard to undo and you *are* in fact making a choice that places her second.", "YTA for making that promise instead of taking your kid to family therapy.", "YTA. As far as I can tell, you\u2019ve never had a real conversation with your daughter about her refusal to accept a new partner for her parents & her refusal to accept step siblings. Do you know why she feels this way? What is she afraid of? Why? Instead of working it out in the beginning, you made a ridiculous promise to appease her & then when you met someone, you \u201cassumed\u201d she\u2019d be fine with the change. It\u2019s time to show some respect & compassion for your daughter. Talk to her. Put the brakes on the new folks moving in until you can work something out with her & help her adjust.", "So... your kid breaks down in hysterics and *demands* that you and your ex not remarry or have children. Instead of addressing this, you agreed? What? \n\nDo you actually discuss things with her or just tell her what's going to happen? Do you prepare her for the next step? Do you broach the subject well before it happens? Or do you think there's a natural progression to this stuff that she should just follow? \n\nGo to family therapy. Get her in a safe, neutral environment where she can talk about why she's afraid of having more siblings or of you marrying. Let her express herself and talk. Until you can sort this out, let her stay with her father (as long as it's safe).\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you guys just chose the easiest route with the least amount of tantrums and tears and never took the time to stop, think, and actually discuss and address what the problem is - and it's likely a whole lot deeper than you expect. \n\nAlso, just because a kid seems to be taking things in stride, doesn't mean they are. We really need to stop just doing a cursory check over kids. If they're not acting out, that doesn't mean everything is fine and dandy. Actually regularly check in with kids and talk about their thoughts and feelings with no fear of consequences. \n\nHonestly, if my parents took more interest in my emotional health, I think things would be a whole lot different now, and I'm sure the same could be said for a lot of other people too.", "YTA  - You just want what you want. She made a clear and articulate request: No new parents or siblings and you agreed.\n\nYou still dismiss her request and at age 12 you call her a child while most family court judges would value her input and preferences.\n\nHave you ever been curious why she reacts with hysteria about the topic? It is a serious reaction and you never asked?!", "Yta. In three years, you changed her family, and now you want to change it again. She told you what she needed to be okay moving forward--no more controllable changes in her family life. You agreed.\n\nI understand you want to shape your life in the way you would like it, but you have a child to think  about. She gets a voice in how her life is shaped too.", "Listen OP, I'm not going to comment on your daughters childish demands or your impulsive promise, because I think you're missing the bigger picture here. \n\nI was your daughter about 20 years ago. I wanted to move in with my dad and my mom would not let it happen. We went to therapy about it. We fought and screamed and cried about it. I started hurting myself and more. By the time I was 15, my mom finally relented one night during a fight, calling my dad and telling him that if he wasn't there to pick me up in half an hour, the cops would be.\n\nThat phone call was 17 years ago. My father is dead. My relationship with my mother has only JUST started healing within the last 5 years or so, and even still, it is rocky. (We are currently not speaking at this very moment in time, though I am optimistic that it will get better soon.)\n\nI'm 32. I have my own daughter. While I would never want to live apart from her, the vitriolic nature of my relationship with my mother is, I think, a far worse fate for any parent and child. If you hold your daughter back when she and her father are willing to put everything on the line to change the custody arrangement (because your daughter is uncomfortable in your home), you are only going to alienate your child from you in ways that may truly be irreparable.\n\nI think that's something you seriously need to consider; the only thing worse than not having your kid home every night is having a child who cuts you out for good the moment they have the opportunity.\n\nFor now, I'm voting N A H, but YWBTA if you keep pushing your daughter away from you like this and continue to refuse to respect her wishes. She's a person too, and she's allowed to have her own thoughts, desires, and wants. Who knows. Maybe she'll go to dads and find out that the grass isn't greener.", "YTA  I think your choice is to wait til your daughter is 18 to remarry or lose her. And what do you mean \" give her power over adults\"? Shes not being unreasonable, you made a serious promise to her and now not only are you going back on your word you're willing to lose your kid over it. If you're that invested in remarriage go for it, but let your daughter move in with her father. At least she can trust him.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t promise your kid something, and then be annoyed she\u2019s upset you broke that promise. I do not think you should force her to live with anyone she doesn\u2019t want to live with. That includes the man you are screwing and you should\u2019ve known that it was important to her. It is a very valid concern and I am on her side.", "YTA.\n\nIt's almost like you made the promise just to shut her up, and now you are making her out to be the one at fault for not rolling with your punches while also invalidating her.\n\nHopefully the court actually appreciates what she says and feels, and realizes she is old enough to have some say in custody arrangements.", "So, OP, your daughter was old enough to know that you wouldn't be able to hold your promise and remarry but not old enough to have preferences to have living space preferences?\n\nAs a parent, it is your job to either honour a promise you made to your child or sit her down and explain how mommy can't promise she won't fall in love with another man and eventually move in with him. \n\nIf the father is really irresponsible at parenting (like you're saying), your lawyer would be less inclined to say \"It can go either way, she's over 12 years old\" and more inclined to say something like \"Parents who do this and that are less likely to get full custody, so there might be a chance\".\n\nYour whole post / vocabulary choice shows that you don't respect your daughter's autonomy and opinions because of her age. It's unbecoming and coupled with the fact that it really does not matter to you that you broke a promise that you made to her...is that the relationship you want with your daughter? Lies, contempt and dismissiveness? You lie about a promise to shut her up, look down upon her feelings and when you go ahead and do what you wanted, tell her it's her fault for believing you?\n\nYou want the lesson your daughter learns from you is that you will lie to her and not hold your word if it gets her to do what you want her to?\n\nBecause so far, what I get is that she was pretty much understanding of the situation (the divorce, the custody schedule). She only had one boundary. Was it a lot to ask? Sure. But you did a big parenting mistake and you're putting it on her. It's not the job of the nine year old to know and accept her mother might remarry and force the nine year old to accept a blended family. If you seemingly accepted that the nine year old could do that, then you have to accept that the twelve year old can tell a judge where she'd prefer to live. \n\nYTA, but it's not too late to fix this. It will come at great cost, though.", "YTA you made an agreement. There are plenty of divorced parents who make the decision not to date until their kids are 18. She\u2019s also old enough that a judge will likely consider her wants in a custody fight. I really believe parents have no business getting married to someone new when their child makes is clear they don\u2019t want that. Her wants matter too. You have flipped her world upside down in only 3 years and are making it clear her feelings don\u2019t matter. You shouldn\u2019t be bringing a man into her life without her consent", "YTA You made an unreasonable promise to your daughter and then assumed she should just get over it. You say she\u2019s just a child who shouldn\u2019t have a say in what happens to her but in the same breath you expect her to be mature and accepting of your misguided lie. Also, if there was any truth to your ex being an irresponsible father how come it\u2019s only now an issue? You sound self absorbed. Your lawyer is right, you should try to handle it amicably, or you might lose her completely.", "Dont make promises you cant keep babe YTA", "YTA... for making a stupid promise and then breaking it!\nShe is old enough to speak for herself. It may go her way if she expresses herself well.", "You and your ex put her through a divorce and she asked that you don\u2019t remarry. All you had to do was not remarry.

You are suppose to raise an independent adult and I don't see that happening magically in unless she is allowed to grow up. Reflect on your parenting goals. I doubt your daughter wants supervision and depending on her behaviour she doesn't really need it anymore either. \n\n\n- \"I don't think it is healthy to give her that much power\" ...

You made a promise just like everything other parent who has broken it and guess what? The world keeps on turning. Explain to her that you\u2019re not replacing her and that circumstances change. Personally, I\u2019d let her hang herself with her own rope. If her father is so keen to take her, let her AND him learn a lesson that she can\u2019t just throw a tantrum and get what she wants- you single and alone so that her precious promise is fulfilled.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She (unfortunately) understood why, so it wasn't a shock, but of course it was still a major change. Our main focus was on doing what was best for her, so we tried to involve her as much as was healthy in what the new schedule would be. We settled on a flexible 50/50 and she took it in stride. The only thing she asked was to never have any new parents or siblings. I thought it was a weird thing to ask for as neither of us were even considering dating, but she was worried to the point of hysterics about it, so we agreed. \n\nA year and a half ago, my now-husband. My daughter met him and they got along fine, she met his kids and that was fine, and she's met probably too many of her father's female guests, so I thought she'd gotten over it. I was wrong. Late last year, we got engaged and started preparing to move in together, and she lost it. She went into hysterics that I was breaking my promise. She announced that she would not be spending the night with me anymore, and demanded to live with her father 100% of the time. I told her that was ridiculous and that the schedule was not changing.\n\nHer father decided to back her, and is willing to fight it in court \"if necessary\". My lawyer says if it goes to court, it could go either way because she's over 12 years old, which is a last resort for us. \n\nI don't want this change. Her father loves her, but he's not really a responsible parent. He leaves her home alone far too much, and doesn't even try to supervise or put limits on anything. More so, my daughter is a child, and she shouldn't have the right to dictate how much she sees her parents.\n\nI know I stupidly agreed to not remarry in that moment, but that wasn't a realistic thing to promise and she has to know that. My ex is on her side and thinks she should live where she's most comfortable, and agrees with her that I'm \"being irresponsible\". I don't think it's healthy to give her that much power, especially over something that was demanded when she was all of nine years old.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Making a promise you can't keep is very bad practice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, she's not wrong. Step-parents and step-siblings can substantially worse the quality of life, or even endanger children.

She wanted to protect herself from this and you said to do so. You can't go back on this promise now without losing your daughter.

There is a whole lot of narcissism reeking out of your post about the way you speak about her and her father. \n\nYour daughter may be a child now and you may not like that she wants some boundaries, but you better be careful because once she's an adult, she definitely can set boundaries and you may not like the strong boundaries she decides to set with you.", "YTA......promises to children always come back to bite you in the butt....you have created this problem.   She will hate both of you...she doesn't want him in her \"home\".  You are telling her that she had no choices over who lives with her because she is a child.  So unless your new husband can get her on board she will resent both of you which  will result  in a difficult marriage. Because of course you will put your new husband first and delegate her to number two  in your life.", "YTA.  The demand your daughter had that you don\u2019t remarry is unreasonable, but it is the price she asked for going along with the custody plan without complaint.\n\nYou\u2019ve now realized this isn\u2019t a promise you can keep, which is fine, I guess, although you should have thought about that before.  However, in response she\u2019s telling you she\u2019s no longer going to accept the 50-50 plan, and she\u2019s old enough that her input will likely matter.  You obviously didn\u2019t engage with her enough as your relationship progressed to understand her feelings, and whether the promise was reasonable or not, you broke it.  You screwed up and should focus on repairing your relationship with your daughter rather than fighting her request.  That probably does mean a significant custody change.\n\nKeep in mind the request originated from her, not her dad.  Fighting it wholesale could end very poorly for you.\n\nSo, imagine you take it to court, fight your daughter\u2019s request, and actually win.  Is 6 years of 50-50 custody (instead of every other weekend or whatever) really worth likely alienating your daughter and making her go no contact when she\u2019s 18?

While the promise was unrealistic, you still remembered it pretty clearly and never thought to talk to her about it before getting engaged? Obviously you don't need her permission to get married. You're an adult woman, and she's a 12 or 13 year old girl. BUT as her mother, you knew that this was something she might have an issue with. And rather than talk to her about it, like an adult would be expected to, you just assumed she was over it. And because of that, you have made it so much harder to get past, because now she is going to have a much harder time trusting you. You're dismissive of her feelings, saying she's just a child. But that doesn't make her feelings any less valid. And it makes it all the harder for her to deal with *because she's a child*. You needed to communicate with her, and reassure her, rather than just assume she'd be okay with it because she had been okay with everything so far. Who knows what issues she might have. It could be so many things. And you can't know without talking to her. You have to work issues out, not put them away and hope they go away. Remember that while the divorce may have been the best thing for everyone, your daughter probably feels like she lost something.

Lemme go over the main points I'm seeing:\n\nOP should wait until her daughters 18- The way she's been holding onto this, I feel like OPs daughter could still be upset if OP were to remarry at 18. I also feel like this really boils OP down to only being a parent but she's a human. While her child is priority number 1, I don't understand why everyone is acting like being in love and unhappy alone is something a child should dictate for their parent. One of the big things a lot of mothers are told are to take care of their needs as well and not to just be \"Mommyfied\". If OPs daughter gets along with OPs partner and her partners kids and isn't being forced to call them siblings or parent terms, what's the issue?\n\nOP shouldn't have promised- This sounds like OPs first child. I'm sure stress was coming from everywhere, for her, for her child, and for her ex during the whole divorce process. So I can't call OP an asshole for doing what she can to console what she described as a hysterical child. Should she have done it- no but hindsight is 20/20. Should she have revisited this issue with therapy? Absolutely but she assumed since it hadn't come up while she was dating or while the child's father was dating other women that it'd be this much of an issue. There are children who throw entire meltdowns over vegetables at 9 than couldn't care less about it at 12. \n\nOPs daughter should choose her life the way OP gets to- I can agree that the marriage should be put on hold but only as long as it takes to get this kid to therapy. The Ex sounds like he's just taking full advantage of his daughter not being happy with OP. He should also be concerned about how catastrophically she's reacting to this. If OP is providing a home that's supportive of her daughter even with additional people, I think letting her ostracize her mom is too extreme.\n\nSo NAH, because I'm not willing to call the kid or her dad an AH at this point either. \n\nOP, y'all need family therapy before this marriage is to happen. I actively support mixed families and pursing things to make yourself happy as well but it seems like your daughter needs a transition period that she never had to emotionally go through when you got divorced because she was placated with a naive promise.

His daughter will be forcibly back with us in two weeks because since she was running wild she was and has been getting into drugs, and it\u2019s hardcore shit.. at only 18. She may or may not be graduating in time (when she was with us she was on track despite the trauma of moving) There\u2019s other things that have been happening as well under her mothers \u201ccare\u201d, but that\u2019s too divulging. \n\nI share this story with you for this reason:\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have made that promise #1. The changes at that time warranted therapy as a family or 1-on-1. Yes she should\u2019ve known this was coming once you introduced someone new in her life, however that doesn\u2019t mean she was ready for it even if all signs pointed to yes. \nBy going to her fathers, you risk a lot of shit in behavior as she will not be monitored and free to do what she wants. That alone should scare you. \nIf you don\u2019t want it happening you fight with every fiber of your being, you BOTH go to family therapy and possibly 1-on-1 as you don\u2019t understand how this impacts a child dealing with not only her world being torn apart, but the insecurity she feels knowing it won\u2019t just be her anymore and fear that you\u2019ll favor the other kids. \nShe\u2019s using dad as a card to hurt you, and you can\u2019t expect a mature speaking person as you demonstrated to her you too weren\u2019t capable of having a conversation about the likelihood of moving on should you find happiness. \nIt\u2019s hard being a parent and try as we may to make the right decisions, we often times forget what it feels like to be that age. If you never dealt with divorced parents at her age, and having your foundation broken, it was selfish of you to assume she would just be ok with a whole new change like what\u2019s happening.", "YTA. If you never planned on going through with your promise, you shouldn't have made it in the first place. Your daughter has the right to decide if she does not want to live with a random adult man.", "YTA, fucking obviously. Choosing your new man over your daughter is enough to make you the arsehole, let alone with the background that you explicitly promised you wouldn't date. You only split up three years ago and you got engaged again six months ago - even by the standards of someone who doesn't have children and blending to consider, that's bloody vast. Stop prioritising what's going into your vagina and start prioritising what came out of it.\n\nEdit: Just seen you're married now?! What. the. fuck. In three years, you went from being married to one man and promising to never date anyone else to married to a different man?! Christ alive woman.", ">I know I stupidly agreed to not remarry in that moment, but that wasn't a realistic thing to promise and she has to know that.\n\nWtf, the ADULT should have known that wasn't a realistic promise to make. How is this an expectation for a child and not OP? YTA 100%.", "You\u2019re going to outnumber her with 3 strangers in her home. Of course she doesn\u2019t want to be there.", "YTA\n\nYou made a promise to her that you never intended to keep. \n\nWas it a ridiculous promise? Yes.  But you still agreed to it.  Now that your ready to move on, you conveniently consider it to have been to trivial to be worth consideration in planning for a new family.\n\nYou should have never made such a promise in the first place.  Since you did then you should have allowed her a voice in deciding on when you and your new family move in together.  If she wasn't comfortable with it then you should have worked with her to figure out why and help the new guy win her over.\n\nInstead, you rushed into a new relationship and basically told her tough shit your just a kid.\n\nThis is her reply to that sentiment.", "YTA My guess is you thought she'd change her mind, and you'd be able to go play happy families, newsflash just because as she is a child doesn't mean her emotions and feelings  and opinions don't matter.", "YTA for not talking to her about it before you decided to get engaged. You knew she didn't want it. You knew you were prioritizing your comfort over hers. I'm not saying that its wrong for you to want to remarry but you absolutely needed to show your daughter more sympathy and patience in this. You needed to talk about how you didn't think she meant forever. You need to ask why she doesn't want it and see what you can address - maybe she would be happier if you committed to a \"just you and her, no steps or halfs\" day. Maybe you need to promise that she never has to share her room. \n\nWhether you think its reasonable or not, 12 is old enough that a judge may choose to change custody based on her wishes. You at least need evidence that you tried to make this change less traumatic for her.", "Ehhhh YTA for promising this thing in the moment and then when the situation  changed- not helping guide her through the adjustment. \n\n\nYou absolutely should\u2019ve made clear that you both may have new partners but mom and dad will ALWAYS  be mom and dad. \n\nYour not being irresponsible for falling in love again. And kids don\u2019t get to decide who to live with like that - adults do. If your both safe parents, that\u2019s what matters. (But your also making assumptions about your ex and his relations with women and assuming your child has met most of them). \n\nYou promised something you couldn\u2019t promise to a child who lost stability. That child is spiraling. \n\nMake time for 1:1 time for you and them- and make sure she has 1:1 time with dad too. \n\nI\u2019m a bonus parent but I still encourage 1:1 time whenever I can (my kiddos 8). \n\n\nIt\u2019s also really harmful that dad would rather deprive a kid of his mom than help educate about how relationships change, or help work thru this transition. \n\nAlso the classic- therapy. Especially for you and her. If she ends up living with him full time- she\u2019s gonna resent you for \u201cabandoning\u201d her. And if she does not- she\u2019s still feeling abandoned. You need to get some family therapy for everyone involved. Ex sounds like he\u2019s mad you found new love.", "YTA.", "YTA it was a stupid promise to make but you did, because it was easy.\n\nWell congratulations, you\u2019ve taught your daughter three things here: 1/ mommy will take the easy way out. \n2/no you are not mommy\u2019s priority, her dating life is. \n3/you only need to keep a promise as long as it\u2019s convenient for you to do so. Integrity and honesty are just words to mommy.", "YTA, and I don't say that lightly. This is a hard call for me to make. On the one hand, you should be allowed to live your life, and I sympathize with you. On the other hand, you did make a promise, and your daughter took you at your word. When divorce happens, it shakes up a child's world and their trust in it. In her eyes, you're betraying her trust. You're introducing someone who you might just choose over her. You are permanently closing the doors on the way your family used to be in a tangible, real way. \n\nI'm a child of divorce myself, so I have some bias but... my parents split when I was 11. My mom didn't even consider dating until I was 16, and she never changed her name because she felt it was important to keep the same last name as my brother and I, even when she eventually got remarried once we were both off at college. And that made a difference.\n\nYou need to put your child first. If your new guy is worth his salt, he'll still be around when she's ready for you to move on.", "Rather than dealing with the unreasonable request you chose to be lazy and just agree. I can agree that promise is unreasonable, but of course shes going to hold you to it. \nIt's also like you seem to have forgotten that until she's 18 your relationships will impact her, it's hardly a case of don't remarry but some actual communication between you and your daughter. Maybe ask her how she feel about your new husband and his kids, since it's likely shes only ever going to see him as that. \nYTA, lazy parenting.", "YTA. He kept his promise and  better yet he backs her up. You broke your promise and now your word means nothing.  You called her ridiculous for not accepting the change you promised wouldnt happen. Court or no court your relationship will not be the one you want.", "She's 12. A court will hear her voice and if she says she feels uncomfortable with the new partner of their mother, the court will take this on board.\n\nThe difficulties really arise where she will run if the father also decides to move on.\n\nHer request, as a child, was not unreasonable from a child perspective. You agreed to it as an adult, knowing that it wasn't reasonable. This is in you and for how you handled it, opting for the easy way then, sadly.\n\nYou may have to accept that moving forward your daughter chooses not reside with you overnight and hope this changes in the future.\n\nBut if it doesn't, you need to respect her if you wish to have any relationship with her.\n\nHer father supporting her, maybe for personal gain, it may just be because he supports his daughter and validates her concerns.\n\nGoing to court is probably the best way forward for the child. But if you wish to maintain your relationship don't alow it to get there before you concede...", "YTA, this problem only exists because you allowed your daughter's issues to thrive. You shouldn't have made that promise, and you should have had some sort of conversation about it since then. You need to get your daughter into therapy and talk to her and try to understand why there is animosity between her and your husband.", "When I was 6 years old, my grandparents promised me to buy me a pony when I was 12. Even though I knew it wasn't quite realistic, I waited years ans years for my 12th birthday with the hope I would get a pony. When I turned 12 I didn't get it. I asked my mom about it and she told me I should drop it. I was very disappointed in my grandparents as they lied to me, it hurt. Also, I learned not to trust people, not even loved ones, when they promise me something.\n\nYTA for not taking your daughter serious. You threw away a major chunk of trust she had in you. You should never promise what you don't intend to hold.", "This is not an AH situation, this is a sucky family situation. \n\nThis sub has an absolute hate boner for stepparents of any kind, so you\u2019re not going to get rational responses on here. \n\nObviously it\u2019s unreasonable to expect you to remain single for the rest of your life because of something you said to a hysterical child in the wake of your divorce. Your life doesn\u2019t stop because you\u2019re a parent, and it\u2019s extremely unhealthy to make personal decisions entirely based on what your child wants. Eventually your child will leave home, and if they\u2019re your entire focus in the world because they didn\u2019t want anyone else entering your lives, that\u2019s going to be unhealthy for both of you. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have made the promise, obviously, and you need to get your kid in therapy. I hope the custody situation works out for you.", "As a child of divorce, ESH.\n\nI was 12 when my mom got remarried. I was fine. Your daughter shouldn't expect you to put your life on hold, she's old enough to understand.\n\nYour ex sucks for encouraging her behaviour.\n\nYou suck for making a promise you couldn't keep instead of putting her in therapy.", "YTA.\n\nNot for breaking a very ill advised promise to never marry or bring any other children into your life--but for lying again to your daughter in saying she's stuck with this because you get to decide if custody changes.\n\nActually you don't get to unilaterally decide that.   Its fine to put yourself first sometimes but if you are wise you'll listen supportively and respect her wishes on where she wants to live.  She doesn't feel comfortable living with you and your husband and stepkids.  Maybe living with her dad will work out maybe it won't so hopefully you aren't also vindictive and choose to punish her if it doesn't.\n\nSometimes its not all about you.  You've been making decisions assuming that (which is again okay imo for you to be sexually and emotionally fulfilled in a positive relationship!) But now it might be time for you to give a little and tolerate some discomfort to give her a chance with dad here.", "Especially when it\u2019s clear she hasn\u2019t even had a proper conversation with her.  Instead of talking to her about her feelings of abandonment after her family dynamic changed, her concerns, she just agreed because it was \u201ceasier\u201d.  Now is invalidating her because again, that\u2019s easier.  Is trying to force her into living with a strange man and a strange family and be happy about it because again\u2026 that\u2019s easier for the OP\n\nAll the while making snarky little comments about the dads \u201cmany overnight visitors\u201d and calling HIS parenting into question. Which I\u2019m sure she has zero issue doing in front of her daughter\n\nI am absolutely convinced if the roles were reversed and OP hadn\u2019t found some man to quickly latch onto but the ex had met and was going to marry another woman/got a new girlfriend pregnant she would be yelling about him breaking their promise from the rooftops\n\nAnd OP, just so we\u2019re clear here- you are allowed to move on and find someone and be happy.  But you need to ALWAYS make sure your child\u2019s best interests are at heart and that she feels safe, respected, and comfortable.  None of which you have done", "This hits the nail on the head. Was it realistic to promise a 9 year old that their parents would *never ever* have another romantic partner or additional children? Absolutely not, but that should\u2019ve been nipped in the bud then. Even if we extend grace to OP given it was a trying time, there\u2019s been three years to get a professional to help them guide their daughter to the realization that most humans need a romantic companion to be happy, and that humans often enjoy having children including her own parents hence why she even exists. A therapist could have helped them assure their daughter no matter what partner or siblings come along, she is one of the most important people in their lives that they love unconditionally and endlessly. Then they would have shown her that with their actions. \n\nThis is still a 12 year old child. OP needs to let her stay at her dads because she is clearly not well, and work through this with doctors. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay for no contact to occur over this, but OP needs to take things slow-She\u2019s had three years to get her kiddo to a healthy point, and she didn\u2019t. Dad sounds awful, and like he\u2019s definitely weaponizing their daughters hurt, but that\u2019s all the more reason OP should have been on top of helping their daughter instead of minimizing her feelings and fears. No one got her help, and now she\u2019s mentally fragile still. YTA", "Because her daughter is a child and OP thinks children aren't allowed to have any agency.", "Especially if you only made the promisse to make things easier for you in the moment. The lesson you are teaching her is that its acceptable to lie to make things easier on themselves with no intention of honoring their word. Grade A parenting. Stop feeling like the superior parent until you can be honest with yourself", "Oh, come on. Some promises are ridiculous. Mom will never get remarried....until when? 18? 25? Daughter is married? Never ever? \n\nThe thought of mom remarrying sent her into hysterics....so mom did a mom thing and said what she had to in order to calm her child and make her feel safe. But it was not a realistic promise.\n\nMy mom did the same with me when I was 6. The thought of my mom dying and leaving me behind sent me into hysterics. I made my mom promise me that if she died, I could be buried with her, like ONLY that thought would calm me down and get me to stop crying. My mom is still alive, but had something happened to her, obviously I would have had to live without her. \n\nMom screwed up by not getting her therapy, but she made the promise to calm her kid. Not following through on a promise to die alone is absurd.", "This is a really immature response", "Especially not so quickly after such a massive and traumatic life change! YTA, OP", "Unfortunately for most teenagers less rules, curfew or task at home are greener grass, even if it often sets them up for failure later. \n\nAnd I do think daughter needs therapy, no matter where she lives. Maybe just for herself, not a family setting. \n\nAnd reading between the lines, it seems that dad's infidelity broke the marriage.", "I second this.", "The thing is in the post OP says \u2018my now husband\u2019, so like, she\u2019s already remarried and never had this conversation with her daughter?! The daughter is 12 so when her mom got engaged she would have understood what that meant. Did she just not talk to her child during the engagement? This is definitely not going to go the way OP thinks or wants", "Yep YTA\n\nIf I broke up with my partner I wouldn't date again till my daughter is 18. She comes first. I have a duty to her. Your relationship with your daughter will never recover from this. You keep dismissing her feelings. She is old enough to decide she doesn't want to live with you anymore. Accept that.", "Not disagreeing that they\u2019re TA, but being able to choose at 12/13, or even have your views heard and considered by a judge at that age, is 100% dependent on the state. In my own case when I was 12, I didn\u2019t get to choose, and the judge gave partial custody to my mother despite ample evidence of abuse. Wasn\u2019t until a guardian ad litem was appointed for me that things changed. That judge\u2019s error is an extreme example, but judging my OPs lawyer saying it could go either way, they\u2019re probably in a state where 12/13 is a gray area in terms of whether a judge will take their input into account", "Dad has a strong case though. Mediators and judges do listen to older children and take their preferences into account.", "This sub skews super young, so you\u2019re never going to get balanced responses to certain types of posts like parent/child dynamics.", "Please don\u2019t call a child unhinged based on her emotional reactions to difficult situations at NINE and twelve years old\u2026", "Whether this would work or not is I think not the issue. I feel like the issue is that OP hasn't even tried it. So many problems and upsets in this world could be avoided by people just communicating with each other.", "Right?

I think everyone has a right to choose who they live with, and if she won\u2019t live with them OP can\u2019t force her to. Because that\u2019s what she was asking, is she the AH for attempting to force her daughter to live with the family she chose after making a promise she wouldn\u2019t do that specific thing. The vagueness of the post is suspicious and it doesn\u2019t make me believe OP is in the right here.", ">Some promises are ridiculous.\n\nAnd should not be made, especially to just make things easier for oneself without thinking about the implications and consequences.", "Lying to your child about a very important decision is not \u201cdoing a mom thing\u201d, it\u2019s lazy parenting. OP could have taken the time to try and understand why her daughter was so terrified of a blended family. \nShe could have explained to her that while she has no interest in dating right now, she could not speak for the future but no matter what happens, her daughter would always come first. \nThe example you provided is completely different. It\u2019s obvious that no one in their right mind would want to be buried alive. A 6 year old doesn\u2019t really understand that death is permanent. Your mom\u2019s lie is equivalent to telling your kids Santa Claus is the one delivering the presents.", "She probably just needed to follow the promise when her daughter was living with her. Seems like she probably will be taken to court and lose a bunch of days because she didn\u2019t take her daughter seriously. The daughter has every right to object to living with someone, even the judges in these cases tend to agree on that. If OP wants to continue living with her daughter she is gong to have to start respecting her like a person she cares about keeping around.", "And like most teenager she will choose the parent who doesn't care about rules, curfew or household tasks. Which is fun but usually sets you up for failure. This girl needs therapy and maybe mom can do malicious compliance like staying engaged without marriage.
