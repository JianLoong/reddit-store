{"id": 14509, "submission_id": "12i5grj", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter that custody isn't changing?", "selftext": "When my ex-husband and I divorced three years ago, my daughter took it fairly well. She (unfortunately) understood why, so it wasn't a shock, but of course it was still a major change. Our main focus was on doing what was best for her, so we tried to involve her as much as was healthy in what the new schedule would be. We settled on a flexible 50/50 and she took it in stride. The only thing she asked was to never have any new parents or siblings. I thought it was a weird thing to ask for as neither of us were even considering dating, but she was worried to the point of hysterics about it, so we agreed. \n\nA year and a half ago, my now-husband. My daughter met him and they got along fine, she met his kids and that was fine, and she's met probably too many of her father's female guests, so I thought she'd gotten over it. I was wrong. Late last year, we got engaged and started preparing to move in together, and she lost it. She went into hysterics that I was breaking my promise. She announced that she would not be spending the night with me anymore, and demanded to live with her father 100% of the time. I told her that was ridiculous and that the schedule was not changing.\n\nHer father decided to back her, and is willing to fight it in court \"if necessary\". My lawyer says if it goes to court, it could go either way because she's over 12 years old, which is a last resort for us. \n\nI don't want this change. Her father loves her, but he's not really a responsible parent. He leaves her home alone far too much, and doesn't even try to supervise or put limits on anything. More so, my daughter is a child, and she shouldn't have the right to dictate how much she sees her parents.\n\nI know I stupidly agreed to not remarry in that moment, but that wasn't a realistic thing to promise and she has to know that. My ex is on her side and thinks she should live where she's most comfortable, and agrees with her that I'm \"being irresponsible\". I don't think it's healthy to give her that much power, especially over something that was demanded when she was all of nine years old.", "created_utc": 1681180324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12i5grj/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_custody_isnt/", "score": 3413, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter likely feels like you are choosing your fianc\u00e9 over her. Not only that,  but you've broken her trust. Go ahead and move in, but know that the damage will be hard to undo and you *are* in fact making a choice that places her second.", "YTA for making that promise instead of taking your kid to family therapy.", "YTA. As far as I can tell, you\u2019ve never had a real conversation with your daughter about her refusal to accept a new partner for her parents & her refusal to accept step siblings. Do you know why she feels this way? What is she afraid of? Why? Instead of working it out in the beginning, you made a ridiculous promise to appease her & then when you met someone, you \u201cassumed\u201d she\u2019d be fine with the change. It\u2019s time to show some respect & compassion for your daughter. Talk to her. Put the brakes on the new folks moving in until you can work something out with her & help her adjust.", "So... your kid breaks down in hysterics and *demands* that you and your ex not remarry or have children. Instead of addressing this, you agreed? What? \n\nDo you actually discuss things with her or just tell her what's going to happen? Do you prepare her for the next step? Do you broach the subject well before it happens? Or do you think there's a natural progression to this stuff that she should just follow? \n\nGo to family therapy. Get her in a safe, neutral environment where she can talk about why she's afraid of having more siblings or of you marrying. Let her express herself and talk. Until you can sort this out, let her stay with her father (as long as it's safe).\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you guys just chose the easiest route with the least amount of tantrums and tears and never took the time to stop, think, and actually discuss and address what the problem is - and it's likely a whole lot deeper than you expect. \n\nAlso, just because a kid seems to be taking things in stride, doesn't mean they are. We really need to stop just doing a cursory check over kids. If they're not acting out, that doesn't mean everything is fine and dandy. Actually regularly check in with kids and talk about their thoughts and feelings with no fear of consequences. \n\nHonestly, if my parents took more interest in my emotional health, I think things would be a whole lot different now, and I'm sure the same could be said for a lot of other people too.", "YTA  - You just want what you want. She made a clear and articulate request: No new parents or siblings and you agreed.\n\nYou still dismiss her request and at age 12 you call her a child while most family court judges would value her input and preferences.\n\nHave you ever been curious why she reacts with hysteria about the topic? It is a serious reaction and you never asked?!", "Yta. In three years, you changed her family, and now you want to change it again. She told you what she needed to be okay moving forward--no more controllable changes in her family life. You agreed.\n\nI understand you want to shape your life in the way you would like it, but you have a child to think  about. She gets a voice in how her life is shaped too.", "Listen OP, I'm not going to comment on your daughters childish demands or your impulsive promise, because I think you're missing the bigger picture here. \n\nI was your daughter about 20 years ago. I wanted to move in with my dad and my mom would not let it happen. We went to therapy about it. We fought and screamed and cried about it. I started hurting myself and more. By the time I was 15, my mom finally relented one night during a fight, calling my dad and telling him that if he wasn't there to pick me up in half an hour, the cops would be.\n\nThat phone call was 17 years ago. My father is dead. My relationship with my mother has only JUST started healing within the last 5 years or so, and even still, it is rocky. (We are currently not speaking at this very moment in time, though I am optimistic that it will get better soon.)\n\nI'm 32. I have my own daughter. While I would never want to live apart from her, the vitriolic nature of my relationship with my mother is, I think, a far worse fate for any parent and child. If you hold your daughter back when she and her father are willing to put everything on the line to change the custody arrangement (because your daughter is uncomfortable in your home), you are only going to alienate your child from you in ways that may truly be irreparable.\n\nI think that's something you seriously need to consider; the only thing worse than not having your kid home every night is having a child who cuts you out for good the moment they have the opportunity.\n\nFor now, I'm voting N A H, but YWBTA if you keep pushing your daughter away from you like this and continue to refuse to respect her wishes. She's a person too, and she's allowed to have her own thoughts, desires, and wants. Who knows. Maybe she'll go to dads and find out that the grass isn't greener.", "YTA  I think your choice is to wait til your daughter is 18 to remarry or lose her. And what do you mean \" give her power over adults\"? Shes not being unreasonable, you made a serious promise to her and now not only are you going back on your word you're willing to lose your kid over it. If you're that invested in remarriage go for it, but let your daughter move in with her father. At least she can trust him.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t promise your kid something, and then be annoyed she\u2019s upset you broke that promise. I do not think you should force her to live with anyone she doesn\u2019t want to live with. That includes the man you are screwing and you should\u2019ve known that it was important to her. It is a very valid concern and I am on her side.", "YTA.\n\nIt's almost like you made the promise just to shut her up, and now you are making her out to be the one at fault for not rolling with your punches while also invalidating her.\n\nHopefully the court actually appreciates what she says and feels, and realizes she is old enough to have some say in custody arrangements.", "So, OP, your daughter was old enough to know that you wouldn't be able to hold your promise and remarry but not old enough to have preferences to have living space preferences?\n\nAs a parent, it is your job to either honour a promise you made to your child or sit her down and explain how mommy can't promise she won't fall in love with another man and eventually move in with him. \n\nIf the father is really irresponsible at parenting (like you're saying), your lawyer would be less inclined to say \"It can go either way, she's over 12 years old\" and more inclined to say something like \"Parents who do this and that are less likely to get full custody, so there might be a chance\".\n\nYour whole post / vocabulary choice shows that you don't respect your daughter's autonomy and opinions because of her age. It's unbecoming and coupled with the fact that it really does not matter to you that you broke a promise that you made to her...is that the relationship you want with your daughter? Lies, contempt and dismissiveness? You lie about a promise to shut her up, look down upon her feelings and when you go ahead and do what you wanted, tell her it's her fault for believing you?\n\nYou want the lesson your daughter learns from you is that you will lie to her and not hold your word if it gets her to do what you want her to?\n\nBecause so far, what I get is that she was pretty much understanding of the situation (the divorce, the custody schedule). She only had one boundary. Was it a lot to ask? Sure. But you did a big parenting mistake and you're putting it on her. It's not the job of the nine year old to know and accept her mother might remarry and force the nine year old to accept a blended family. If you seemingly accepted that the nine year old could do that, then you have to accept that the twelve year old can tell a judge where she'd prefer to live. \n\nYTA, but it's not too late to fix this. It will come at great cost, though.", "YTA you made an agreement. There are plenty of divorced parents who make the decision not to date until their kids are 18. She\u2019s also old enough that a judge will likely consider her wants in a custody fight. I really believe parents have no business getting married to someone new when their child makes is clear they don\u2019t want that. Her wants matter too. You have flipped her world upside down in only 3 years and are making it clear her feelings don\u2019t matter. You shouldn\u2019t be bringing a man into her life without her consent", "YTA You made an unreasonable promise to your daughter and then assumed she should just get over it. You say she\u2019s just a child who shouldn\u2019t have a say in what happens to her but in the same breath you expect her to be mature and accepting of your misguided lie. Also, if there was any truth to your ex being an irresponsible father how come it\u2019s only now an issue? You sound self absorbed. Your lawyer is right, you should try to handle it amicably, or you might lose her completely.", "Dont make promises you cant keep babe YTA", "YTA... for making a stupid promise and then breaking it!\nShe is old enough to speak for herself.

If her father is so keen to take her, let her AND him learn a lesson that she can\u2019t just throw a tantrum and get what she wants- you single and alone so that her precious promise is fulfilled.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She (unfortunately) understood why, so it wasn't a shock, but of course it was still a major change. Our main focus was on doing what was best for her, so we tried to involve her as much as was healthy in what the new schedule would be. We settled on a flexible 50/50 and she took it in stride. The only thing she asked was to never have any new parents or siblings. I thought it was a weird thing to ask for as neither of us were even considering dating, but she was worried to the point of hysterics about it, so we agreed. \n\nA year and a half ago, my now-husband. My daughter met him and they got along fine, she met his kids and that was fine, and she's met probably too many of her father's female guests, so I thought she'd gotten over it. I was wrong. Late last year, we got engaged and started preparing to move in together, and she lost it. She went into hysterics that I was breaking my promise. She announced that she would not be spending the night with me anymore, and demanded to live with her father 100% of the time. I told her that was ridiculous and that the schedule was not changing.\n\nHer father decided to back her, and is willing to fight it in court \"if necessary\". My lawyer says if it goes to court, it could go either way because she's over 12 years old, which is a last resort for us. \n\nI don't want this change. Her father loves her, but he's not really a responsible parent. He leaves her home alone far too much, and doesn't even try to supervise or put limits on anything. More so, my daughter is a child, and she shouldn't have the right to dictate how much she sees her parents.\n\nI know I stupidly agreed to not remarry in that moment, but that wasn't a realistic thing to promise and she has to know that. My ex is on her side and thinks she should live where she's most comfortable, and agrees with her that I'm \"being irresponsible\". I don't think it's healthy to give her that much power, especially over something that was demanded when she was all of nine years old.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Making a promise you can't keep is very bad practice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, she's not wrong. Step-parents and step-siblings can substantially worse the quality of life, or even endanger children.

She wanted to protect herself from this and you said to do so. You can't go back on this promise now without losing your daughter. Your daughter's request has not been strange. who would want to live with someone you don't know well, who has different norms, values \u200b\u200band rules. that is going to change the whole dynamic in your own home just because you want it to.

Why would a ten or twelve year old expect that the agreement you made wasn't a real agreement, or that of course you were going to break your word. She expressed a need and you are trampling over her now because it's what's best for you. All you've demonstrated to her is that your word does not matter. There is a whole lot of narcissism reeking out of your post about the way you speak about her and her father. \n\nYour daughter may be a child now and you may not like that she wants some boundaries, but you better be careful because once she's an adult, she definitely can set boundaries and you may not like the strong boundaries she decides to set with you.", "YTA......promises to children always come back to bite you in the butt....you have created this problem.   She will hate both of you...she doesn't want him in her \"home\".  You are telling her that she had no choices over who lives with her because she is a child.  So unless your new husband can get her on board she will resent both of you which  will result  in a difficult marriage. Because of course you will put your new husband first and delegate her to number two  in your life.", "YTA.  The demand your daughter had that you don\u2019t remarry is unreasonable, but it is the price she asked for going along with the custody plan without complaint.\n\nYou\u2019ve now realized this isn\u2019t a promise you can keep, which is fine, I guess, although you should have thought about that before.  However, in response she\u2019s telling you she\u2019s no longer going to accept the 50-50 plan, and she\u2019s old enough that her input will likely matter.  You obviously didn\u2019t engage with her enough as your relationship progressed to understand her feelings, and whether the promise was reasonable or not, you broke it.  You screwed up and should focus on repairing your relationship with your daughter rather than fighting her request.  That probably does mean a significant custody change.\n\nKeep in mind the request originated from her, not her dad.  Fighting it wholesale could end very poorly for you.\n\nSo, imagine you take it to court, fight your daughter\u2019s request, and actually win.  Is 6 years of 50-50 custody (instead of every other weekend or whatever) really worth likely alienating your daughter and making her go no contact when she\u2019s 18?

How many kids are we talking about new husband having? Does she now have to share a room with a stranger / step sibling? How many rooms in the house?

Maybe not require any overnights depending on the living situation (eg sharing a room).\n\nI think it\u2019s less about no remarrying - new siblings, but more about how fast you\u2019re moving.

She just needs to process the emotions she\u2019s feeling. And you need to talk with her. Also Ex husband isn\u2019t helping , but what can you do", "YTA. While the promise was unrealistic, you still remembered it pretty clearly and never thought to talk to her about it before getting engaged? Obviously you don't need her permission to get married. You're an adult woman, and she's a 12 or 13 year old girl. BUT as her mother, you knew that this was something she might have an issue with. And rather than talk to her about it, like an adult would be expected to, you just assumed she was over it. And because of that, you have made it so much harder to get past, because now she is going to have a much harder time trusting you. You're dismissive of her feelings, saying she's just a child. But that doesn't make her feelings any less valid. And it makes it all the harder for her to deal with *because she's a child*. You needed to communicate with her, and reassure her, rather than just assume she'd be okay with it because she had been okay with everything so far. Who knows what issues she might have. It could be so many things. And you can't know without talking to her. You have to work issues out, not put them away and hope they go away. Remember that while the divorce may have been the best thing for everyone, your daughter probably feels like she lost something.

Lemme go over the main points I'm seeing:\n\nOP should wait until her daughters 18- The way she's been holding onto this, I feel like OPs daughter could still be upset if OP were to remarry at 18. I also feel like this really boils OP down to only being a parent but she's a human. While her child is priority number 1, I don't understand why everyone is acting like being in love and unhappy alone is something a child should dictate for their parent. One of the big things a lot of mothers are told are to take care of their needs as well and not to just be \"Mommyfied\". If OPs daughter gets along with OPs partner and her partners kids and isn't being forced to call them siblings or parent terms, what's the issue?\n\nOP shouldn't have promised- This sounds like OPs first child. I'm sure stress was coming from everywhere, for her, for her child, and for her ex during the whole divorce process. So I can't call OP an asshole for doing what she can to console what she described as a hysterical child. Should she have done it- no but hindsight is 20/20. Should she have revisited this issue with therapy? Absolutely but she assumed since it hadn't come up while she was dating or while the child's father was dating other women that it'd be this much of an issue. There are children who throw entire meltdowns over vegetables at 9 than couldn't care less about it at 12. \n\nOPs daughter should choose her life the way OP gets to- I can agree that the marriage should be put on hold but only as long as it takes to get this kid to therapy. The Ex sounds like he's just taking full advantage of his daughter not being happy with OP. He should also be concerned about how catastrophically she's reacting to this. If OP is providing a home that's supportive of her daughter even with additional people, I think letting her ostracize her mom is too extreme.\n\nSo NAH, because I'm not willing to call the kid or her dad an AH at this point either. \n\nOP, y'all need family therapy before this marriage is to happen. I actively support mixed families and pursing things to make yourself happy as well but it seems like your daughter needs a transition period that she never had to emotionally go through when you got divorced because she was placated with a naive promise.

She may or may not be graduating in time (when she was with us she was on track despite the trauma of moving) There\u2019s other things that have been happening as well under her mothers \u201ccare\u201d, but that\u2019s too divulging. \n\nI share this story with you for this reason:\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have made that promise #1. The changes at that time warranted therapy as a family or 1-on-1. Yes she should\u2019ve known this was coming once you introduced someone new in her life, however that doesn\u2019t mean she was ready for it even if all signs pointed to yes. \nBy going to her fathers, you risk a lot of shit in behavior as she will not be monitored and free to do what she wants. That alone should scare you. \nIf you don\u2019t want it happening you fight with every fiber of your being, you BOTH go to family therapy and possibly 1-on-1 as you don\u2019t understand how this impacts a child dealing with not only her world being torn apart, but the insecurity she feels knowing it won\u2019t just be her anymore and fear that you\u2019ll favor the other kids. \nShe\u2019s using dad as a card to hurt you, and you can\u2019t expect a mature speaking person as you demonstrated to her you too weren\u2019t capable of having a conversation about the likelihood of moving on should you find happiness. \nIt\u2019s hard being a parent and try as we may to make the right decisions, we often times forget what it feels like to be that age. If you never dealt with divorced parents at her age, and having your foundation broken, it was selfish of you to assume she would just be ok with a whole new change like what\u2019s happening.", "YTA. If you never planned on going through with your promise, you shouldn't have made it in the first place. Your daughter has the right to decide if she does not want to live with a random adult man.", "YTA, fucking obviously. Choosing your new man over your daughter is enough to make you the arsehole, let alone with the background that you explicitly promised you wouldn't date.

Stop prioritising what's going into your vagina and start prioritising what came out of it.\n\nEdit: Just seen you're married now?! What. the. fuck. In three years, you went from being married to one man and promising to never date anyone else to married to a different man?! Christ alive woman.", ">I know I stupidly agreed to not remarry in that moment, but that wasn't a realistic thing to promise and she has to know that.\n\nWtf, the ADULT should have known that wasn't a realistic promise to make.

Now that your ready to move on, you conveniently consider it to have been to trivial to be worth consideration in planning for a new family.\n\nYou should have never made such a promise in the first place.  Since you did then you should have allowed her a voice in deciding on when you and your new family move in together.  If she wasn't comfortable with it then you should have worked with her to figure out why and help the new guy win her over.\n\nInstead, you rushed into a new relationship and basically told her tough shit your just a kid.\n\nThis is her reply to that sentiment.", "YTA My guess is you thought she'd change her mind, and you'd be able to go play happy families, newsflash just because as she is a child doesn't mean her emotions and feelings  and opinions don't matter.", "YTA for not talking to her about it before you decided to get engaged. You knew she didn't want it. You knew you were prioritizing your comfort over hers. I'm not saying that its wrong for you to want to remarry but you absolutely needed to show your daughter more sympathy and patience in this. You needed to talk about how you didn't think she meant forever. You need to ask why she doesn't want it and see what you can address - maybe she would be happier if you committed to a \"just you and her, no steps or halfs\" day. Maybe you need to promise that she never has to share her room. \n\nWhether you think its reasonable or not, 12 is old enough that a judge may choose to change custody based on her wishes. You at least need evidence that you tried to make this change less traumatic for her.", "Ehhhh YTA for promising this thing in the moment and then when the situation  changed- not helping guide her through the adjustment. \n\n\nYou absolutely should\u2019ve made clear that you both may have new partners but mom and dad will ALWAYS  be mom and dad. \n\nYour not being irresponsible for falling in love again. And kids don\u2019t get to decide who to live with like that - adults do. If your both safe parents, that\u2019s what matters. (But your also making assumptions about your ex and his relations with women and assuming your child has met most of them). \n\nYou promised something you couldn\u2019t promise to a child who lost stability. That child is spiraling. \n\nMake time for 1:1 time for you and them- and make sure she has 1:1 time with dad too. \n\nI\u2019m a bonus parent but I still encourage 1:1 time whenever I can (my kiddos 8). \n\n\nIt\u2019s also really harmful that dad would rather deprive a kid of his mom than help educate about how relationships change, or help work thru this transition. \n\nAlso the classic- therapy. Especially for you and her. If she ends up living with him full time- she\u2019s gonna resent you for \u201cabandoning\u201d her. And if she does not- she\u2019s still feeling abandoned.

On the one hand, you should be allowed to live your life, and I sympathize with you. On the other hand, you did make a promise, and your daughter took you at your word. When divorce happens, it shakes up a child's world and their trust in it. In her eyes, you're betraying her trust. You're introducing someone who you might just choose over her. You are permanently closing the doors on the way your family used to be in a tangible, real way. \n\nI'm a child of divorce myself, so I have some bias but... my parents split when I was 11. My mom didn't even consider dating until I was 16, and she never changed her name because she felt it was important to keep the same last name as my brother and I, even when she eventually got remarried once we were both off at college.

If your new guy is worth his salt, he'll still be around when she's ready for you to move on.", "Rather than dealing with the unreasonable request you chose to be lazy and just agree. I can agree that promise is unreasonable, but of course shes going to hold you to it. \nIt's also like you seem to have forgotten that until she's 18 your relationships will impact her, it's hardly a case of don't remarry but some actual communication between you and your daughter. Maybe ask her how she feel about your new husband and his kids, since it's likely shes only ever going to see him as that. \nYTA, lazy parenting.", "YTA.

You agreed to it as an adult, knowing that it wasn't reasonable.

Even though I knew it wasn't quite realistic, I waited years ans years for my 12th birthday with the hope I would get a pony. When I turned 12 I didn't get it. I asked my mom about it and she told me I should drop it. I was very disappointed in my grandparents as they lied to me, it hurt.

Your life doesn\u2019t stop because you\u2019re a parent, and it\u2019s extremely unhealthy to make personal decisions entirely based on what your child wants.

A 9 year old isn't a toddler. She will remember that promise and could hold you to until she dies. While I understand wanting to calm your children and give the security, you can't offer that through lies and empty promises. \nSecond AH move was you assumed she was ok with you moving on and breaking the promise. You never talked to her about it. She probably needed more time. While 3 years sounds like a long time, 1.5 years isn't a long time. That is when you started dating seriously. That is when this conversation should have happened. You should have talked with her about how you were feeling and how she was feeling. Talked to her about the promise you made and how it wasn't realistic. You should have talked with her about how you could make the transition more comfortable for her. You honestly didn't think about her opinion or feelings much. You just assumed a lot. \nYour next mistake is thinking she's OLD enough to understand that the promise was an empty one and unrealistic while also thinking she is too YOUNG to decide where to live. You can't have it both ways. Either she is old enough to understand ADULT choices or she isn't.

She had thoughts and is old enough to understand a lot of what you have done. YOU need to apologize, give her space and work on rebuilding your relationship with her. YOU broke her trust. YOU didn't give her a safe space to talk to you when she was uncomfortable and hurting. She shouldn't have the right to prevent you from happiness with a new partner but YOU didn't communicate with her honestly or show care for how this was affecting her. A new partner in your life is a huge change for everyone in this dynamic.

I think people rushing to be remarried is a big reason why second marriages have a 75% divorce rate.", "People are often desperate to get back \u201con track\u201d with their life and getting remarried or moving in with a new partner is exciting, so they ignore the past and \u201cmove on\u201d.

I agree that I wouldn\u2019t be in any rush but some people don\u2019t like to be alone.", "OP had a kid that would get hysterical over the mere thought of having a step parent and siblings to the point she begged for a promise from each parent to basically never marry.\n\nOP\u2019s reaction? \u201cWhatever.

But she did so to avoid a tough conversation at the time and look where that has gotten her. In a spot that she\u2019s going to have to have an easy tougher conversation with a much older child who is at an age where she has a good deal of power in deciding where she should live, and that\u2019s the way it should be.

It sounds like she lost trust in  relationships and was scarred from the experience to the point she'd rather want to avoid them. Also, it sounds like you don't take your child serious and like you never really sat her down to talk things through with her, assuming she'd surely understand things. So, on one hand you deny her having a say in her life and on the other hand you expect her to mature enough to understand things naturally. Maybe it is time to start talking/explaing AND listening to her and consider seeking professional assistance.   \n(soft) YTA for not taking your child serious enough to properly help her understand the situation.\n\nLittle anecdote: I got a Barbie house for Christmas when I was 6-7 years old and my mum promised me to play Barbies with me. It was, for some reason, very important to me. She was always too busy. She never had/took the time to play \"Barbie house\" with me. I'm a grown person and I still remember. Not only that she didn't play with me but also how hurt I was up until I was a teenager.", "To hitch myself to this comment, OP, I was also your daughter 25 years ago. I have no recollection of my parents together; they separated before I was three and divorced when I was five. Despite my mother's issues with addiction, she was granted primary custody (both my parents had issues, so in the eyes of the Friend of the Court, this was the lesser of two evils).\n\nMy dad never made any promises, and was actively dating when my parents finally divorced. She was a really lovely woman, but couldn't handle the drama. He'd go on to have a few more relationships before remarrying when I was 13.\n\nMy mother, on the other hand, sat me down one evening around ten to tell me that I was her everything, that it was me and her against the world and nothing would ever separate us. In almost the same breath, she proceeded to gush how in love she was with the guy she'd started seeing in the last few months, how she was happier than she could remember. I had met this man a few months prior when she came to pick me and my friends up from Girl Scouts and he was in the car. That was our big introduction.\n\nHe was a nice man, but about 20 years older than my mother and also an addict. He was nice to me and certainly tried, but his own kids were around my age now, so he was pretty out of his depth. More than anything, it was the shock of the sudden change. I went to see my father for Spring Break, and when I returned her boyfriend had moved in. No discussion with me, same as our introduction. \n\nI felt like a third wheel in my own family. They basically acted like I wasn't there most of the time. The perception of having my mother put me aside stays with me to this day.\n\nSo, when I went to see my dad for summer break, I decided I wanted to stay with my dad. He was (is) a very intense person, but always a loving and devoted father. The courts agreed that at eleven, I was old enough to call the shots on where I lived. \n\nMy mother was of course furious, and said that I just wanted to stay with my dad because I had better toys, a little tv and stereo, etc. None of this was true, I just wanted a **parent**. **An involved parent**.\n\nWhen I went to visit my mother for Christmas, I found they'd gotten married a few weeks earlier, with the explanation that since I didn't care for her bf that I wouldn't want to be there. This choice irreparably damaged our relationship. She could never understand that I was trying to do what was right for **me**, that it was a tough decision, but I had legitimate reasons that weren't a 14\" tv and a stereo. Just like your daughter probably has her reasons beyond \"permissive parenting\".\n\nEven though she succumbed to addiction about 13 years after I moved out, I don't regret my decision. We worked to repair the damage, and she was one of my best friends when she died, but the feeling of being an afterthought, or that I wasn't old enough to make my own decisions for adult reasons, never went away. We never had the relationship either of us wanted because she was dismissive of my choice about the custody arrangement. \n\nI share this in hopes that you or any other parent that needs to see this and think about their child as a separate entity with their own opinions/hopes/ideas. I don't want you to go through what my mother did, and I DEFINITELY don't want your daughter to be in her mid-thirties with the same trauma trunk to unpack. **PLEASE** have an honest conversation with your daughter with an open heart and mind. \n\nRight now, YTA. Your baby has been through so many changes in such a short time, please treat her like the separate entity she is and listen to what she needs.", "14 is the average age for a child to decide for themselves in the US, but at age 12 or even 13 a judge pretty much will go with the child's wishes if no danger is involved.

I have a feeling she has lawyer on speed dial waiting for her ex to screw up", "This exactly. OP, you've taught your daughter that you can't be trusted. If you're lucky, she won't generalize that to mean no adults can be trusted. \n\nYou talk about her like she doesn't have thoughts, opinions, or feelings that matter. She does. But instead of listening to her feelings and treating them as valid, you decided to say whatever it took to make her shut up.\n\nHave you considered sending her to therapy to process the trauma she's been through?", "Is it necessary to say \u201cthe man you are screwing\u201d?

Have repeated conversations with her about her feelings on the relationship. Make sure she has access to therapy in case she feels a need to vent, process her feelings and say things she'd be afraid to say to mom and dad because it might hurt them.\n\nBasically, he'd progress in life while taking pains to make sure that his daughter sees that dad can do things like date and fall in love while still loving her and valuing her ability to feel safe and secure.\n\nWhen kids feel secure and know that their parents truly care about them, they're a lot more open to the idea of their parents having other people in their lives and it's a lot easier to reach the point where everyone is comfortable with a remarriage.\n\nMom, on the other hand, just assumed that her daughter's feelings have changed without ever talking to her about it at all (\"I thought she'd gotten over it.\" not a word about discussing it and making sure she understood her daughter's emotional state) and then tried to frame herself as some kind of victim of her daughter.

Parents who do that kind of thing end up with kids who say, \"He makes you really happy, mom.

I know by 12 years old I was left on my own for several hours a day after school pretty much every day.", "> This is the most one perspective'd posts I've seen in a while, loads of omitted information, OP is definitely TA.\n\nAnd yet everyone is still calling OP out. YTA OP! So glaringly obvious no editing will help.", "My Father got full custody of me and my sister when I was 12, and the judge asked me. I told the truth that at the time my Dad was a better parent with a better living situation, so I wanted to live with him. But the situation at my Mom's was awful, so it takes a LOT for a child to pick Dad in that judge's chamber (and that child's word isn't the only thing the judgement is based on, but it carries a ton of weight).", "I was in the hospital a bunch when my kids were young, their friends mom died when they were in 2nd grade.\n\nI try not to lie at all, so I told them I have no intention of dying, having MS doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m likely to die soon and my intention is to live for ever but I\u2019ll settle for 212. \n\nThey\u2019d say that\u2019s ridiculous, I\u2019d say just because no one\u2019s done it yet doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t be the first\u2026\n\nThey\u2019d calm down, until the next time, and we\u2019d do it again.", "Some of the things I have heard kids at school say about how they interact with their step parents just breaks my heart. And kids talk to other kids. Its likely that the daughter has heard all the negatives about blended families, step parents and feeling like an unwanted guest in the middle of your own life. So, that's likely why she believes that having a stepparent and new siblings will be a nightmare? Kids talk to other kids and lots of what they reveal is not nuanced, pretty, or easy to just roll with.", "Not always. That scares me. The fact that the mom is so quick to say it's NEVER GONNA HAPPEN makes me worried, not just about what everyone is thinking. All kinds of abuse can happen when the child is viewed as an accessory and not a living, feeling people.", "I am not saying that there aren't good stories but majority of second marriages end in divorce and primary reasons are kids so it's better to compartmentalise their lives. I mean people can have good romantic lives without moving into one house.", "I might or might not be reading too much into this, but given this:\n\n>When my ex-husband and I divorced three years ago, my daughter took it fairly well. ***She (unfortunately) understood why***...\n\nI'm thinking a horribly toxic relationship that left the kid traumatized buy *both* parents and the kid is fucking terrified of experiencing that again or seeing another kid go through that. The divorce is a positive in the kid's life because it saved her from a horrible situation of having her parents together and she's probably going to have relationship issues. Now the engagement is seen as the toxicity returning and she's having a PTSD type response.\n\nAt least given the limited info we have, it fits.", "Yes, OP is doing something wrong by not caring about her child's feelings about the whole thing.", "Lol, I missed that part at the end! I was looking for the age at the beginning of the post, and had even gone back to check!", "That statistic isn't for only 2nd marriages with children, so it isn't valid in this conversation. Children are only one of many reasons why second marriages fail. Your rationale is overly simplistic.  There is no \"its better for the kids if parents never get involved again\"", ">Children are only one of many reasons why second marriages fail\n\nYes one of the main reasons is kids.\n\n\n>There is no \"its better for the kids if parents never get involved again\"\n\nNever said they shouldn't get involved again. I said they should wait to move in or get married. It's better for everyone involved.", "It was \"the primary reason\" before and now it's \"one of the main reasons\", and in both cases you didn't provide a source."]}
