So I fully get that this is seriously impacting probably every part of your life. \n\nThat said, you have a very young baby.

I'd find a lotion for sensitive skin, or aloe vera gel, keep the bottle in the fridge and put that on regularly wherever you get hives, especially after showering and at night.\n\nHives are of course more than just a skin irritation response, but if you're taking medication to treat the underlying issue then this stuff may help even a bit with those symptoms in the mean time.", "Your baby is 6 weeks old, it\u2019s comfort is more important than yours.YTA", "YTA.

I find that timing way too close together.  This would make my first guess is one of the baby products is causing your allergic reaction or you could have hive inducing stress from a newborn if you never had one before.  (I am just guessing on the latter).  \n\nIt might be miserable if any of them are the source of reaction but you could put some of the products on parts of your skin where you could see an immediate flare up if you are allergic to it.
