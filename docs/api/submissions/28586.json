I guess because I think loving people loudly is my personal jam. Mostly, I think this just comes down to a difference of love languages between you and yours, in a way. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think this alone means that your girlfriend is controlling, just possibly being loved loudly may be her personal jam too.

Never once did she think you would love it.\nBest explanation is that she gets easily jealous and she wants to mark her territory. \nThis is pretty childish and not a cute romantic thing. \n\nIf she won't budge you need to talk.

Giving someone a gift that says they love you?? Even if it was your parents that's weird, it's like she's forcing you to say it.\n\nAnd 2) her wanting you to wear it to school shows a controlling behavior and insecurity, she might as well give you a megaphone and have you yell it around the campus...", "NAH. She meant well, and you aren't intending to hurt her feelings. \n\nI'd offer to return or exchange it for something you both like.

Tale as old as time. Jealousy will never be satisfied. It's a call coming from inside the house.\n\nIf you really love her, you can tell her, hey, of course I love you but this is getting out of hand, and I'm worried about you. What are you afraid of and how can I help? But that's some real heavy lifting, especially if you're both young.

Look...it's a hoodie. I've gotten plenty of clothing gifts that I didn't like, but if I end up seeing the person, I may wear that floral top once just to appease them and maybe not wear it again (I hate floral prints...my partner knows this). You're both young and she was trying her best to be thoughtful. Wear it once and let her know what kinds or clothing or gifts you would like.", "More like a \u201cfuck off and don\u2019t bother hitting on me\u201d sign. \n\nIsn\u2019t that what wedding rings are for too?  Supposed to work that way, anyway.  Nothing keeps asshole horndogs of any sex from hitting on people who just want to be left alone.  I\u2019m So glad that dropped off as I got \u201ctoo old.\u201d", "It's best to not associate real life relationships with Internet bullshit. I swear to fucking God, online stuff is so far removed from the reality I experience in every regard.", "No, that would be letting her think she's allowed to do weird shit like this. She needs to learn that this is fuckin weird", "Bullshit, she is absolutely an asshole for wanting him to wear this. This is controlling and manipulative, no matter what age.", "lol I got my BiL a tee shirt with my sister's face all over it for Christmas a few years ago, he proudly wore it all day Christmas day! Google \"custom face shirt\" on amazon and go wild!", "I have some from my daughter as a fathers day present, I'll try to find out. Hilarious", "Why are they not compatible? Because of different dress sense?", "You can be totally head over heels in love with your partner and not want to wear a completely ridiculous item of clothing like that. It screams insecure.", "Look man, I've been with my wife for going on ten years now. I'm nutty as a squirrel turd for her, and I would quite literally die for her.\n\nBut if she got me some shit like this, it's going over the balcony and into the river. You should seek help", "Yeah, I picked up on that. My point is, people in your position are often so desperate for a relationship that they will accept being in a toxic one, just to not be single anymore. I genuinely meant it when I said good luck, cause that's a rough road.", "It's clearly possessive. Again, if she thought it was funny or that OP would have actually like this, then she wouldn't be upset with OP for not wanting to wear it. She wants to stake her claim. It's gross and possessive.", "Wanting him to wear it is not controlling or manipulative the desire for him to wear it is not the problem the childish reaction to him not wanting to wear it is manipulative", "Classic AITA responde. Sometimes and often a spade is a spade. Touch grass. She probably thought it was cute, he doesn\u2019t dig it. End of story. His reaction was ooof though.", "I'm going for socks bc he probably will wear them to work under his suit, much to the delight of family and colleagues\n Off to look for custom face socks!", "My husband's friends did that for his bachelor trip. Got Hawaiian shirts with his face all over it since they were going to DR.\nHe just came back from another friend's bachelor trip where they all got hats with the guy's face on it \ud83d\ude04\ud83e\udd23", "Not willing to sacrifice isn't very head over heels", "Your so funny man \ud83d\ude02", "You're responding to a different account than you did with your first comment, just fyi", "Sacrifice and compromise when it comes to real life issues are important. This is just teen BS.", "I think the desire to sacrifice is related to the stakes of doing so. If this was something that made me uncomfortable but would seriously help her, I\u2019d do it. But it\u2019s a hoodie, she\u2019ll survive", "You're *", "Oops I see that now. The edit where they added the 2nd bit makes that more obvious lol.", "You seem to be getting heated for some teenage bs though", "What's the stakes bro, are your friends gonna make fun of you  for being a in a commited relationship oh noooooo. Oh bother. What ever shall you do", "\u2026heated? Okay.", "The stakes are minimal on both sides, that\u2019s my point. Nothing bad will happen if I wear it, nothing bad will happen if I don\u2019t"]}
