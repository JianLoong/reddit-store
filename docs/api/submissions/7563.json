I\u2019ve been working as a bank manager for over 30 years. There is a teller I manage 35ishM, let\u2019s call him Jim. \n\nJim has only worked here for a few months. Before this he was a self-proclaimed \u201cEbay guy\u201d. He would buy products, then resell them on Ebay for a profit, which I didn\u2019t know you could do, and found pretty interesting. \n\nAround Christmas time, he started selling random products he had at his teller station in the bank during his shift. Every customer that would come to his teller window would get a sales pitch for a painted Yeti cup, phone case, or whatever he had at the time. He would also hound people in the drive-thru about purchasing his items. \n\nI was shocked, and found this wildly inappropriate. It\u2019s also completely against our company policy. To me, he\u2019s not only selling something while working for another company, he\u2019s also hounding customers who are just coming in for deposits/withdrawals, not looking to be sold to like a retail store. \n\nSome lead executives (my boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss) from the bank also saw him do this and we\u2019re not happy with it either. \n\nI told him he couldn\u2019t do it anymore, and he lost it. He flew off the handle and accused us (bank management) of wanting him to stay poor. He said he has a surgery he needs desperately, and this was the only way he could get it. \n\nSo, AITA here? My kids (in their 20s and 30s) say I\u2019m not, and I did the right thing. But he was just so angry when we told him to stop.", "created_utc": 1673967954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10eegqf/aita_for_stopping_an_employee_from_selling_their/", "score": 1696, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's a major conflict of interest to operate your own business while you're at work for another business. He should have been fired", "Nta \n\nI don't care if he is saving for his surgery\nHe can take his buisness else where", "NTA. This guy shouldn\u2019t be representing your bank. As a customer, I\u2019d be highly pissed if I came in for business and got a sales push. \n\nTotally inappropriate. And he flew off the handle! That\u2019s even more concerning.", "NTA, but this is such a clear violation of typical rules that don't you worry about him having access to confidential account information?", "NTA. I don't even like it when a bank pitches its own products to me while I'm trying to make a simple deposit. I can't imagine how annoyed your customers were when your wayward employee started pitching products that were completely unrelated.", "Absolutely NTA, and very unethical behavior\n\nYour clients are there to do business for their banking, not be getting hounded and solicited to buy his EBay crap.\n\nAlso, it's added liability for the business because if any of those customers are dissatisfied, they could also come back with complaints and issues that will potentially affect YOUR actual business.\n\nDude should be fired. He's side hustling on your dime, not doing his actual job", "NTA - I'm not sure how he can pitch a fit when it's literally against company policy. If I was just making a deposit and got hit with a sales pitch, I'd be really uncomfortable with that. Sorry that he needs surgery - but that doesn't mean he gets to go against policly.", "NTA.\n\nEither he understood the policy and ignored it, or he's too stupid to understand the policy.\n\nHe easily could be fired for this. Simply requiring that he follow policy is the least you should have done.\n\nALSO:  If he is truly this desperate for money, he is a liability to the bank.  He might try his hand at embezzlement.   And if he DOESN'T need an operation, then he's a compulsive liar who can't take responsibility for his own actions,  which is another reason to watch him closely.", "NTA it's against company policy, if he has an issue he can't take it up with head office.", "Reading the title, I expected it to be something like Jim leaving an Avon catalogue in the break room for colleagues to look at/buy from him\u2026 not pitching his shit to customers of a bank, to the point of harassment, while working as a teller. \n\nI\u2019m honestly shocked he wasn\u2019t fired for gross misconduct. And as for his reaction\u2026 surely he can\u2019t think that ANY business would be happy for an employee to conduct personal business on company time? When has that ever been acceptable? It reflects so poorly on the bank - if I went into my bank and an employee started trying to flog me unrelated goods I would be speaking to management immediately to make a complaint. It\u2019s bad enough when they try to upsell other financial services provided by the bank, but this is something else entirely!\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA- way over the line professionally for him to be selling to customers and promoting \u201chis business\u201d at teller station", "Nta. Give a warning and if it continues fire him. Perfectly justified.", "Nta that\u2019s insanely unprofessional on his part. Imagine just going to the bank and getting hounded to buy some random thing, noone would like that. Be very cautious of him with sensitive information", "NTA. This is a reasonable and extremely common policy companies have, including my own. I'm assuming he agreed to these policies when he accepted the job offer and stayed through training?\n\nAnyway, I would certainly not want a sales pitch on something totally unrelated when I'm just trying to deposit checks at the bank. If he needs extra money, I'm sure no one's stopping him from selling this stuff after hours or on the weekends.", "Nta. Your request was reasonable. His reaction to the request would make me want to get rid of him, though.", "NTA, at all. I\u2019m failing to see how you could have done anything differently, it\u2019s not like you personally reported him. He was seen by *your* seniors.", "NTA if I was your bank customer and this happened to me it would be enough to make me switch banks", "What's stopping him from selling on E-bay? He can't do sales pitch during his shift he's supposed to be doing his job! NTA", "NTA...He's putting your bank's reputation on the line.  It's incredible to me that he thought this was okay.", "NTA, this would make me hella uncomfortable as a person making a deposit. cus this boils down to \"Hey, nice paycheck, wanna buy something off me?\" Like hell nah", "NTA: This is a huge conflict of interest for all parties involved. His feelings about it are his own and you are not in control of his emotions. That's all on him. Stick to your official company boundaries and you'll be ok.", "Nope NTA. He is using the banks customer platform to sell his product. He has no contract with the bank to give them a share of his profits. Even eBay charges a fee for each transaction. He is silly to think the bank or any company would allow him to make a profit off their business model.", "NTA.  His actions and his behavior would get him terminated in 99.9% of the companies out there", "NTA\n\nIt would be fine if he sold it to other employees during break, or something like that, but selling it to the business customers, really?\n\nI work in a bank, and I think it's extremely kind of you (to a point where it's detrimental to yourself) not to fire him on spot first time you've seen him doing that.", "NTA - As a manager I would find it inappropriate as well.  As a customer, whose perspective you really have to take into account, I would hate getting a pitch (especially unrelated) in a business that I was not wanting.  The fact that he went off is over the top.  That is not his time or his place to be doing that.\n\nAs long as it didn't get out of hand, I trusted them, and they would leave it alone, I would allow them to have a business card with their etsy/ebay/whatever shop on it, so if someone asked where they got it, he could just hand them that.  He burned that bridge with his reaction though.  He should not be initiating the conversation with customers at all.", "NTA. What a dumbass this employee is. The whole point of Ebay is that you don't need to have shop to sell stuff.\n\nAnd of course you are right. People come to banks for their financial business, not to be bothered by people who advertise their crap to them.", "NTA. That is 100% against any company's policy. You can't run your own business from your employer's workplace or during work hours.\n\nHe's trying to use the client list for his own business and he has access to confidential company and customer information. That's a form of theft: the bank built this clientele, not him.\n\nHe's also stealing time from the company, obviously. Instead of doing his job and moving to the next customer, he takes time aside for his own business. Time that you pay him.", "NTA", "NTA, but how did you not know what ebay was?", "NTA. I also am a PT reseller, mainly my own stuff though, and mostly clothes and shoes. I sell on a few platforms, but I would NEVER think to harass or even ask my co-workers to look at my stuff, and buy it. He was WAY out of line.", "NTA. Most employers have a policy again running side gigs on company time. Fire his ass.", "NTA. \n\nI was expecting something along the lines of 'some customers have asked an employee about their (tumbler, hat, whatever their craft/hobby is) and offered to purchase them' not 'random bank teller is forcing customers through a sales pitch before allowing them to conduct their business,' holy hell.", "YTA to your customers for not warning him the first time and firing him if he didn\u2019t immediately stop.", "NTA. Sounds like he\u2019s taking advantage of the fact that he knows how much money customers have and that some of them will have cash on them that he\u2019s hoping they will spend on his junk. If I saw that at my bank I would turn around and walk right out and make a complaint to the manager.", "Nta. It\u2019s against policy and inappropriate.", "NTA - He is being incredibly unprofessional, therefore putting his job and finances at risk.", "No but it's a little unclear what's going on here. Does he report to you or are you on the same level?\n\nIf he's your report, then you should have shut this down immediately and then given a written warning. Your boss's boss' boss should never be in the mix on an issue of simple misconduct.\n\nIf you are at the same level as him, then sure, it's not you responsibility to manage him but it's very appropriate to speak up when someone is flaunting the rules and hassling customers at a financial institution.\n\nNTA.", "NTA if he wants to be \"ebay guy\" he can do it outside of work", "NTA    I would have been offended if my bank allowed their employees do this. It's beyond inappropriate, and this person has access to my personal information. \n\nHe shouldn't be working there. Sure I feel bad he needs extra money, but your bank needs to be professional.", "NTA and you should fire his ass", "I used to work at a goodwill where a bunch of rich people would do this. It\u2019s scalping. They\u2019re taking sometimes REALLY GREAT ANTIQUES and selling them for full price online and it\u2019s deplorable. Those items are meant for people with lower income who can\u2019t normally buy them at full price. Your coworker is an asshole and a worm. NTA tell on his ass.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He can sell his items wherever, but not there", "NTA.  When he's at the bank, he works only for the bank.  Outside of working hours he can do what he wants.

Completely unprofessional and I would stop going to places that allowed it.", "NTA - and let him go if he doesn't stop it.\n\nSeriously - that's a lovely way to drive off customers.   If he pulled that on me,  I'd verbally complain to the manager, and follow up with a letter (to the manager).  And if the manager blew me off, the letter would go to corporate.\n\nI won't speak to the legalities of it.  IANAL.  But it is absolutely unprofessional and it makes your bank look unprofessional also.", "NTA.

If someone went wrong or someone got sick or injured from a product he sold there, the bank could be liable too.", "\u2026 bank drive-thrus are really a thing?", "NTA that\u2019s not appropriate he\u2019s there to do a job for his company he can run his side business on his time", "NTA oh my god thank you. I would not want to deal with that as a customer at the bank!!", "NTA!!!!!! As a bank CEO\u2019s daughter and a customer at the same bank I would be horrified if one of the tellers tried to sell me something. I would definitely take this to a higher up ASAP. It would be different if he was using company time to get online every once in a while to sell his crap on eBay(still probably a fireable offense) but to actually harass customers is absurd!!", "It's pretty much standard in any employment contract that I have seen to exclude other forms of work when employed by the company. You can probably just confirm this with HR.\n\nI'm amazed that none of the customers have made a complaint yet, and it's definitely damaging the reputation of the bank.\n\nNTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: agreed with others, no way a manager of 30 years in a bank wouldn't know this stuff. This has to be fake.\n\n# I checked poster's history- no way he is a 59YO bank manager.", "NTA - He's making customers uncomfortable. He's violating company policy. Write him up.", "If your employee can't survive, your banks the asshole. Not you, but you represent them. If they are having to ebay shit to get a surgery then your bank is failing at caring for its employees. You should stop him, cause it's not good to have him sell to bank customers, but need to step up and get him a raise or get the health plan your bank has set up put in an override and get the surgery covered. If you don't step up, YTA", "I guess NTA but how the fuck do you have 30 years experience in management and not consider an employee using this job to sell things to your customers, thereby bothering them and hurting the bank as a whole? I kind of want to give you a Y T A just for having 30 years experience and still asking this question.\n\nTo any functional adult, that is an obvious no no.", "No matter what industry it takes place in, massive conflict of interest.\n\nOP should have put a stop to it the first time they saw it happen.", "They weren't asking if it was legal, they were asking if they were an asshole. When someone tries hard enough to make you feel like an asshole, whether you really are or not, sometimes you start wondering if they're right.", "Or stinking up the place with her scented oil diffuser", "Should you have someone so desperate for money working at a bank?", "He probably doesn\u2019t want to do eBay anymore because eBay now gives 1099 forms for even just $600 of sales per year when it used to be that you had to sell much more for them to do that. I don\u2019t know a lot about the details as I am not a reseller, but I have a friend who is and said that within their online groups about reselling people are complaining about the new eBay / tax rules and trying to find alternatives of where to sell stuff. Doesn\u2019t excuse what he\u2019s doing as he shouldn\u2019t be trying to essentially work a second job simultaneously while doing his main job and if this is the case then it makes him even more sleazy so you\u2019re still NTA.\n\nAlso I just wanted to add that when I first saw your title I fully expected him to be shilling an MLM haha", "A watch would've been a nice change from what I read. But a phone case or a painted Yeti cup..? I can't imagine what I'd do as a client if the bank teller offered me to buy something LOL. Probably would be shocked and definitely avoid the bank afterwards!", "I used to sell things on eBay as a side hustle/hobby.  Jim isn't really selling things on eBay if he's selling them off their site.  In order to sell on eBay you have to list the item on their site and pay eBay a portion of the proceeds.  If an item is already listed on eBay, you still have to pay a portion of listing price if you remove the item and sell it to someone else and if you do that very many times they will ban your account.", "And what changed your opinion on that?", "Info: Honest question, who do you have 30 years experience in management and even question the obvious fact that an employee cannot run their business on company time while you are paying them?\n\nThat might come off rude and I'm sorry, but I'm seriously baffled to your reasoning that led to any doubts that aren't illogical to any functional adult with any kind of work history.", "Every bank I know has a drive-thru ATM, are drive-thru tellers a real thing???", "Girl Scout cookies, too. I don\u2019t want to be guilted or shamed into buying overpriced calories I actively don\u2019t need by some winsome moppet with sad puppy eyes set to attack every customer near the grocery store door.", ">It would feel like Jim saw my bank balance and decided I have enough money to buy his crap. \n\nYeah, immediately fired and then refer to the SEC to monitor possible issues in the future. Just sketch as hell.", "Holy crap, you must want to buy a shitload of yeti cups!", "\"It has holographic velociraptors on it.\"\n\n\"Sold\"", "I'd file a complaint against the management everytime if I was getting those kinds of \"offers\".", "It's the harassing customers at the desk yard sale for me. How did he not get fired on the spot?!", "Haha this one I'd agree with tho (like no, don't let it happen)", "Comment stolen from: /u/purplewoodcarver \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10eegqf/aita_for_stopping_an_employee_from_selling_their/j4qdrkz/\n\nBot Reported.", "lolz", "A hair stylist may be a gray area, depending on the salon some of them basically \"rent\" a chair at the salon and are considered independent contractors.  They would not be violating salon policies to sell their own stuff, but they still have to know which customers to approach and how.  If they are employees of a chain they are often stuck trying to get us to buy salon shampoos and stuff.", "Yeah, this story is fake, I can't believe people are buying it. I worked in the financial industry for years; this wouldn't have been allowed to go on for 5 MINUTES, let alone weeks! There are regulations against this, (including but not limited to doing your own financial transactions while also acting as the teller??!) Nope, the guy would have been fired a long time ago.", "I know right, I kind of want to say she's TA for not immediately pulling him of the floor and contacting the bank president the very first moment it was noticed he was doing this.", "The stylist I was talking about owned her salon and may have had one or two employees besides her, so there was no management to report her to.\n\nAwkwardly enough though, she now rents a chair at my current stylist's salon. Good thing she's usually not there when I am!", ">A dog would never.\n\n...family dogs steal and destroy expensive shoes and then demand the next 4 months worth of treats with pitiful looks all the time.", "There are. And he would have been fired immediately. This story cannot be real.", "Lol, stop by the service desk.  I did the day I HAD IT with getting \u2018the talk\u2019 and really did tell them I was going to quit if it didn\u2019t stop.  She put an orange sticker on the back of my card and handed it back.  I stared at it and said \u2018That\u2019s it?  It\u2019s that simple to make it stop? WHY DIDN\u2019T SOMEONE TELL ME SOONER?!\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re not alone.
