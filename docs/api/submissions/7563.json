I\u2019ve been working as a bank manager for over 30 years. There is a teller I manage 35ishM, let\u2019s call him Jim. \n\nJim has only worked here for a few months. Before this he was a self-proclaimed \u201cEbay guy\u201d. He would buy products, then resell them on Ebay for a profit, which I didn\u2019t know you could do, and found pretty interesting. \n\nAround Christmas time, he started selling random products he had at his teller station in the bank during his shift. Every customer that would come to his teller window would get a sales pitch for a painted Yeti cup, phone case, or whatever he had at the time. He would also hound people in the drive-thru about purchasing his items. \n\nI was shocked, and found this wildly inappropriate. It\u2019s also completely against our company policy. To me, he\u2019s not only selling something while working for another company, he\u2019s also hounding customers who are just coming in for deposits/withdrawals, not looking to be sold to like a retail store. \n\nSome lead executives (my boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss) from the bank also saw him do this and we\u2019re not happy with it either. \n\nI told him he couldn\u2019t do it anymore, and he lost it. He flew off the handle and accused us (bank management) of wanting him to stay poor. He said he has a surgery he needs desperately, and this was the only way he could get it. \n\nSo, AITA here? My kids (in their 20s and 30s) say I\u2019m not, and I did the right thing. But he was just so angry when we told him to stop.", "created_utc": 1673967954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10eegqf/aita_for_stopping_an_employee_from_selling_their/", "score": 193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's a major conflict of interest to operate your own business while you're at work for another business. He should have been fired", "Nta \n\nI don't care if he is saving for his surgery\nHe can take his buisness else where", "NTA. This guy shouldn\u2019t be representing your bank. As a customer, I\u2019d be highly pissed if I came in for business and got a sales push. \n\nTotally inappropriate. And he flew off the handle! That\u2019s even more concerning.", "NTA, but this is such a clear violation of typical rules that don't you worry about him having access to confidential account information?", "NTA. I don't even like it when a bank pitches its own products to me while I'm trying to make a simple deposit. I can't imagine how annoyed your customers were when your wayward employee started pitching products that were completely unrelated.", "Absolutely NTA, and very unethical behavior\n\nYour clients are there to do business for their banking, not be getting hounded and solicited to buy his EBay crap.\n\nAlso, it's added liability for the business because if any of those customers are dissatisfied, they could also come back with complaints and issues that will potentially affect YOUR actual business.\n\nDude should be fired. He's side hustling on your dime, not doing his actual job", "NTA - I'm not sure how he can pitch a fit when it's literally against company policy. If I was just making a deposit and got hit with a sales pitch, I'd be really uncomfortable with that. Sorry that he needs surgery - but that doesn't mean he gets to go against policly.", "NTA.\n\nEither he understood the policy and ignored it, or he's too stupid to understand the policy.\n\nHe easily could be fired for this. Simply requiring that he follow policy is the least you should have done.\n\nALSO:  If he is truly this desperate for money, he is a liability to the bank.  He might try his hand at embezzlement.   And if he DOESN'T need an operation, then he's a compulsive liar who can't take responsibility for his own actions,  which is another reason to watch him closely.", "NTA it's against company policy, if he has an issue he can't take it up with head office.", "Reading the title, I expected it to be something like Jim leaving an Avon catalogue in the break room for colleagues to look at/buy from him\u2026 not pitching his shit to customers of a bank, to the point of harassment, while working as a teller. \n\nI\u2019m honestly shocked he wasn\u2019t fired for gross misconduct. And as for his reaction\u2026 surely he can\u2019t think that ANY business would be happy for an employee to conduct personal business on company time? When has that ever been acceptable? It reflects so poorly on the bank - if I went into my bank and an employee started trying to flog me unrelated goods I would be speaking to management immediately to make a complaint. It\u2019s bad enough when they try to upsell other financial services provided by the bank, but this is something else entirely!\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA- way over the line professionally for him to be selling to customers and promoting \u201chis business\u201d at teller station", "Nta. Give a warning and if it continues fire him. Perfectly justified.", "Nta that\u2019s insanely unprofessional on his part. Imagine just going to the bank and getting hounded to buy some random thing, noone would like that. Be very cautious of him with sensitive information", "NTA. This is a reasonable and extremely common policy companies have, including my own. I'm assuming he agreed to these policies when he accepted the job offer and stayed through training?\n\nAnyway, I would certainly not want a sales pitch on something totally unrelated when I'm just trying to deposit checks at the bank. If he needs extra money, I'm sure no one's stopping him from selling this stuff after hours or on the weekends.", "Nta. Your request was reasonable. His reaction to the request would make me want to get rid of him, though.", "NTA, at all. I\u2019m failing to see how you could have done anything differently, it\u2019s not like you personally reported him. He was seen by *your* seniors.", "NTA if I was your bank customer and this happened to me it would be enough to make me switch banks", "What's stopping him from selling on E-bay? He can't do sales pitch during his shift he's supposed to be doing his job! NTA", "NTA...He's putting your bank's reputation on the line.  It's incredible to me that he thought this was okay.", "NTA, this would make me hella uncomfortable as a person making a deposit. cus this boils down to \"Hey, nice paycheck, wanna buy something off me?\" Like hell nah", "NTA: This is a huge conflict of interest for all parties involved. His feelings about it are his own and you are not in control of his emotions. That's all on him. Stick to your official company boundaries and you'll be ok.", "Nope NTA. He is using the banks customer platform to sell his product. He has no contract with the bank to give them a share of his profits. Even eBay charges a fee for each transaction. He is silly to think the bank or any company would allow him to make a profit off their business model.", "NTA.  His actions and his behavior would get him terminated in 99.9% of the companies out there", "NTA\n\nIt would be fine if he sold it to other employees during break, or something like that, but selling it to the business customers, really?\n\nI work in a bank, and I think it's extremely kind of you (to a point where it's detrimental to yourself) not to fire him on spot first time you've seen him doing that.", "NTA - As a manager I would find it inappropriate as well.  As a customer, whose perspective you really have to take into account, I would hate getting a pitch (especially unrelated) in a business that I was not wanting.  The fact that he went off is over the top.  That is not his time or his place to be doing that.\n\nAs long as it didn't get out of hand, I trusted them, and they would leave it alone, I would allow them to have a business card with their etsy/ebay/whatever shop on it, so if someone asked where they got it, he could just hand them that.  He burned that bridge with his reaction though.  He should not be initiating the conversation with customers at all.", "NTA. What a dumbass this employee is. The whole point of Ebay is that you don't need to have shop to sell stuff.\n\nAnd of course you a right. People come to banks for their financial business, not to be bothered by people who advertise their crap to them.", "NTA. That is 100% against any company's policy. You can't run your own business from your employer's workplace or during work hours.\n\nHe's trying to use the client list for his own business and he has access to confidential company and customer information. That's a form of theft: the bank built this clientele, not him.\n\nHe's also stealing time from the company, obviously. Instead of doing his job and moving to the next customer, he takes time aside for his own business. Time that you pay him.", "NTA", "NTA, but how did you not know what ebay was?", "NTA. I also am a PT reseller, mainly my own stuff though, and mostly clothes and shoes. I sell on a few platforms, but I would NEVER think to harass or even ask my co-workers to look at my stuff, and buy it. He was WAY out of line.", "NTA. Most employers have a policy again running side gigs on company time. Fire his ass.", "NTA. \n\nI was expecting something along the lines of 'some customers have asked an employee about their (tumbler, hat, whatever their craft/hobby is) and offered to purchase them' not 'random bank teller is forcing customers through a sales pitch before allowing them to conduct their business,' holy hell.", "YTA to your customers for not warning him the first time and firing him if he didn\u2019t immediately stop.", "NTA. Sounds like he\u2019s taking advantage of the fact that he knows how much money customers have and that some of them will have cash on them that he\u2019s hoping they will spend on his junk. If I saw that at my bank I would turn around and walk right out and make a complaint to the manager.", "Nta. It\u2019s against policy and inappropriate.", "NTA - He is being incredibly unprofessional, therefore putting his job and finances at risk.", "No but it's a little unclear what's going on here. Does he report to you or are you on the same level?\n\nIf he's your report, then you should have shut this down immediately and then given a written warning. Your boss's boss' boss should never be in the mix on an issue of simple misconduct.\n\nIf you are at the same level as him, then sure, it's not you responsibility to manage him but it's very appropriate to speak up when someone is flaunting the rules and hassling customers at a financial institution.\n\nNTA.", "NTA if he wants to be \"ebay guy\" he can do it outside of work", "NTA    I would have been offended if my bank allowed their employees do this. It's beyond inappropriate, and this person has access to my personal information. \n\nHe shouldn't be working there. Sure I feel bad he needs extra money, but your bank needs to be professional.", "NTA and you should fire his ass", "I used to work at a goodwill where a bunch of rich people would do this. It\u2019s scalping. They\u2019re taking sometimes REALLY GREAT ANTIQUES and selling them for full price online and it\u2019s deplorable. Those items are meant for people with lower income who can\u2019t normally buy them at full price. Your coworker is an asshole and a worm. NTA tell on his ass.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm surprised you didn't get any complaints from the bank customers.   He was completely out of order and you did the right thing.", "NTA - in what world would this be ok? I would be pissed if I went to the bank and someone tried to sell me something other than a banking product. Maybe girl scout cookies or candy for the local kids sport team, but that is it.", "By his logic: if I desperately need money, I can sell drugs steal cars rob banks, because that's my only way. \n\nThis clown cannot be doing his personal sales sht on company hours and company premises.

His behavior is inappropriate and his response to your correction was more so.

What would happen if someone called home office. That would have come back on you.", "NTA, he\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t fire him.", "Nta - but tread lightly.  This feels like desperation behavior.  As a people manager i would pull him aside separately.  First reiterate that selling things at work ends now, full stop.  But if you are a bank i have to imagine there is an employee assistance plan you can put him in touch with if things are really bad health wise.  Empathize, but be firm and offer support if its needed.  But selling shit at work ends now no questions asked.    \n   \nI also agree with daughters assessment about him working near money.

You don't understand how Goodwill works. The sales fund community programs and services. The more sales they make, the better it is for the community, especially lower income.

He can go peddle his crap in a park on his time, not the banks.\n\nCould always ask him how he is going to pay for surgery when he is unemployed due to violating company policy...", "I wonder if that is because people are so weary of how on edge so many people are.  I certainly would have said something if I was a customer.", "Your daughter is a smart one. NTA and this guy should be let go", "Yes and Yes. This is major red flag behavior here.
