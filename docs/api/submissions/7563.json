I\u2019ve been working as a bank manager for over 30 years. There is a teller I manage 35ishM, let\u2019s call him Jim. \n\nJim has only worked here for a few months. Before this he was a self-proclaimed \u201cEbay guy\u201d. He would buy products, then resell them on Ebay for a profit, which I didn\u2019t know you could do, and found pretty interesting. \n\nAround Christmas time, he started selling random products he had at his teller station in the bank during his shift. Every customer that would come to his teller window would get a sales pitch for a painted Yeti cup, phone case, or whatever he had at the time. He would also hound people in the drive-thru about purchasing his items. \n\nI was shocked, and found this wildly inappropriate. It\u2019s also completely against our company policy. To me, he\u2019s not only selling something while working for another company, he\u2019s also hounding customers who are just coming in for deposits/withdrawals, not looking to be sold to like a retail store. \n\nSome lead executives (my boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss) from the bank also saw him do this and we\u2019re not happy with it either. \n\nI told him he couldn\u2019t do it anymore, and he lost it. He flew off the handle and accused us (bank management) of wanting him to stay poor. He said he has a surgery he needs desperately, and this was the only way he could get it. \n\nSo, AITA here? My kids (in their 20s and 30s) say I\u2019m not, and I did the right thing. But he was just so angry when we told him to stop.", "created_utc": 1673967954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10eegqf/aita_for_stopping_an_employee_from_selling_their/", "score": 779, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's a major conflict of interest to operate your own business while you're at work for another business. He should have been fired", "Nta \n\nI don't care if he is saving for his surgery\nHe can take his buisness else where", "NTA. This guy shouldn\u2019t be representing your bank. As a customer, I\u2019d be highly pissed if I came in for business and got a sales push. \n\nTotally inappropriate. And he flew off the handle! That\u2019s even more concerning.", "NTA, but this is such a clear violation of typical rules that don't you worry about him having access to confidential account information?", "NTA. I don't even like it when a bank pitches its own products to me while I'm trying to make a simple deposit. I can't imagine how annoyed your customers were when your wayward employee started pitching products that were completely unrelated.", "Absolutely NTA, and very unethical behavior\n\nYour clients are there to do business for their banking, not be getting hounded and solicited to buy his EBay crap.\n\nAlso, it's added liability for the business because if any of those customers are dissatisfied, they could also come back with complaints and issues that will potentially affect YOUR actual business.\n\nDude should be fired. He's side hustling on your dime, not doing his actual job", "NTA - I'm not sure how he can pitch a fit when it's literally against company policy. If I was just making a deposit and got hit with a sales pitch, I'd be really uncomfortable with that. Sorry that he needs surgery - but that doesn't mean he gets to go against policly.", "NTA.\n\nEither he understood the policy and ignored it, or he's too stupid to understand the policy.\n\nHe easily could be fired for this. Simply requiring that he follow policy is the least you should have done.\n\nALSO:  If he is truly this desperate for money, he is a liability to the bank.  He might try his hand at embezzlement.   And if he DOESN'T need an operation, then he's a compulsive liar who can't take responsibility for his own actions,  which is another reason to watch him closely.", "NTA it's against company policy, if he has an issue he can't take it up with head office.", "Reading the title, I expected it to be something like Jim leaving an Avon catalogue in the break room for colleagues to look at/buy from him\u2026 not pitching his shit to customers of a bank, to the point of harassment, while working as a teller. \n\nI\u2019m honestly shocked he wasn\u2019t fired for gross misconduct. And as for his reaction\u2026 surely he can\u2019t think that ANY business would be happy for an employee to conduct personal business on company time? When has that ever been acceptable? It reflects so poorly on the bank - if I went into my bank and an employee started trying to flog me unrelated goods I would be speaking to management immediately to make a complaint. It\u2019s bad enough when they try to upsell other financial services provided by the bank, but this is something else entirely!\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA- way over the line professionally for him to be selling to customers and promoting \u201chis business\u201d at teller station", "Nta. Give a warning and if it continues fire him. Perfectly justified.", "Nta that\u2019s insanely unprofessional on his part. Imagine just going to the bank and getting hounded to buy some random thing, noone would like that. Be very cautious of him with sensitive information", "NTA. This is a reasonable and extremely common policy companies have, including my own. I'm assuming he agreed to these policies when he accepted the job offer and stayed through training?\n\nAnyway, I would certainly not want a sales pitch on something totally unrelated when I'm just trying to deposit checks at the bank. If he needs extra money, I'm sure no one's stopping him from selling this stuff after hours or on the weekends.", "Nta. Your request was reasonable. His reaction to the request would make me want to get rid of him, though.", "NTA, at all. I\u2019m failing to see how you could have done anything differently, it\u2019s not like you personally reported him. He was seen by *your* seniors.", "NTA if I was your bank customer and this happened to me it would be enough to make me switch banks", "What's stopping him from selling on E-bay? He can't do sales pitch during his shift he's supposed to be doing his job! NTA", "NTA...He's putting your bank's reputation on the line.  It's incredible to me that he thought this was okay.", "NTA, this would make me hella uncomfortable as a person making a deposit. cus this boils down to \"Hey, nice paycheck, wanna buy something off me?\" Like hell nah", "NTA: This is a huge conflict of interest for all parties involved. His feelings about it are his own and you are not in control of his emotions. That's all on him. Stick to your official company boundaries and you'll be ok.", "Nope NTA. He is using the banks customer platform to sell his product. He has no contract with the bank to give them a share of his profits. Even eBay charges a fee for each transaction. He is silly to think the bank or any company would allow him to make a profit off their business model.", "NTA.  His actions and his behavior would get him terminated in 99.9% of the companies out there", "NTA\n\nIt would be fine if he sold it to other employees during break, or something like that, but selling it to the business customers, really?\n\nI work in a bank, and I think it's extremely kind of you (to a point where it's detrimental to yourself) not to fire him on spot first time you've seen him doing that.", "NTA - As a manager I would find it inappropriate as well.  As a customer, whose perspective you really have to take into account, I would hate getting a pitch (especially unrelated) in a business that I was not wanting.  The fact that he went off is over the top.  That is not his time or his place to be doing that.\n\nAs long as it didn't get out of hand, I trusted them, and they would leave it alone, I would allow them to have a business card with their etsy/ebay/whatever shop on it, so if someone asked where they got it, he could just hand them that.  He burned that bridge with his reaction though.  He should not be initiating the conversation with customers at all.", "NTA. What a dumbass this employee is. The whole point of Ebay is that you don't need to have shop to sell stuff.\n\nAnd of course you are right. People come to banks for their financial business, not to be bothered by people who advertise their crap to them.", "NTA. That is 100% against any company's policy. You can't run your own business from your employer's workplace or during work hours.\n\nHe's trying to use the client list for his own business and he has access to confidential company and customer information. That's a form of theft: the bank built this clientele, not him.\n\nHe's also stealing time from the company, obviously. Instead of doing his job and moving to the next customer, he takes time aside for his own business. Time that you pay him.", "NTA", "NTA, but how did you not know what ebay was?", "NTA. I also am a PT reseller, mainly my own stuff though, and mostly clothes and shoes. I sell on a few platforms, but I would NEVER think to harass or even ask my co-workers to look at my stuff, and buy it. He was WAY out of line.", "NTA. Most employers have a policy again running side gigs on company time. Fire his ass.", "NTA. \n\nI was expecting something along the lines of 'some customers have asked an employee about their (tumbler, hat, whatever their craft/hobby is) and offered to purchase them' not 'random bank teller is forcing customers through a sales pitch before allowing them to conduct their business,' holy hell.", "YTA to your customers for not warning him the first time and firing him if he didn\u2019t immediately stop.", "NTA. Sounds like he\u2019s taking advantage of the fact that he knows how much money customers have and that some of them will have cash on them that he\u2019s hoping they will spend on his junk. If I saw that at my bank I would turn around and walk right out and make a complaint to the manager.", "Nta. It\u2019s against policy and inappropriate.", "NTA - He is being incredibly unprofessional, therefore putting his job and finances at risk.", "No but it's a little unclear what's going on here. Does he report to you or are you on the same level?\n\nIf he's your report, then you should have shut this down immediately and then given a written warning. Your boss's boss' boss should never be in the mix on an issue of simple misconduct.\n\nIf you are at the same level as him, then sure, it's not you responsibility to manage him but it's very appropriate to speak up when someone is flaunting the rules and hassling customers at a financial institution.\n\nNTA.", "NTA if he wants to be \"ebay guy\" he can do it outside of work", "NTA    I would have been offended if my bank allowed their employees do this. It's beyond inappropriate, and this person has access to my personal information. \n\nHe shouldn't be working there. Sure I feel bad he needs extra money, but your bank needs to be professional.", "NTA and you should fire his ass", "I used to work at a goodwill where a bunch of rich people would do this. It\u2019s scalping. They\u2019re taking sometimes REALLY GREAT ANTIQUES and selling them for full price online and it\u2019s deplorable. Those items are meant for people with lower income who can\u2019t normally buy them at full price. Your coworker is an asshole and a worm. NTA tell on his ass.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thank you for saving your customers sanity.", "NTA- \n\nTo be honest- I\u2019d be watching all accounts VERY closely. I know someone personally who worked in a bank and over several months stole almost a total of $50k out of customer accounts. She was eventually caught and charged.

That guy needs to keep his job and side-hustle separate.    Super Inappropriate behavior.", "NTA - he's paid by the company to promote the interests of the company while at work.

Completely unprofessional and I would stop going to places that allowed it.", "NTA - and let him go if he doesn't stop it.\n\nSeriously - that's a lovely way to drive off customers.   If he pulled that on me,  I'd verbally complain to the manager, and follow up with a letter (to the manager).  And if the manager blew me off, the letter would go to corporate.\n\nI won't speak to the legalities of it.  IANAL.  But it is absolutely unprofessional and it makes your bank look unprofessional also.", "NTA. You are trying to save his job, and if he does not comply with company policy and gets fired, then he for sure cannot pay for surgery.  He is not thinking, here.", "NTA - my goodness, that\u2019s so inappropriate and honestly, if I was a customer coming in to make a deposit/withdrawal I\u2019d be hella annoyed at him.

I am literally doing an internship and it\u2019s not even been a month and have total work experience of 2 months (it\u2019s the cultural norm here to start working after graduation) and even I know that this is highly unprofessional and a fireable offence in most places. NTA OP AT ALL", "I avoid a branch of my bank because there is a lady there whose job it is to always sell insurance. I cant imagine selling me actual crap. I'd probably try to figure out some way of shaming him into realising how awful this is.   \n\nNTA and also thank you", "NTA you said it's against your company laws. If I go to my bank I don't want to be bothered by such a guy to buy random stuff.\n\nCollect any incoming complains from customers, inform HR. This is minimum a write up.", "NTA. That\u2019s wildly inappropriate.", "NTA. Your customers did not sign up for this when they agreed to bank there.", "NTA. He knows the policy.", "NTA. It\u2019s a bank not a flee market. If he does his job, great. His eBay stuff is for his own personal time.", "NTA you can't harass your employer's customers to buy crap on your employer's timr", "Definitely NTA. No one is saying he can\u2019t sell stuff online, just don\u2019t sell it while you\u2019re working. I have an online store in addition to my day job, but would never pester people to purchase while at work. Not to mention, this sort of hounding could drive business away. Honestly, I think he\u2019s just very immature and spoiled.", "NTA. Jim should be able to sell stuff at the bank because people are far more important than banks and honestly screw banks but you could lose your job if you did nothing so you can't be blamed.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s highly unprofessional and a conflict to try and sell or promote your own business at work. \n\nIf he needs the money for surgery he should try a yard sale or something if he has so much inventory. \n\nI\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t been fired yet, in my opinion.", "NTA. If my anxiety ridden behind rode up to deposit some cash and I had to deal with someone trying to aggressively sell me something, I would close my account all the way down.", "NTA. It's against company policy.", "Very much NTA.\n\nI once had a job in a normal old office building. One of the other employees had a personal side business. There was nothing wrong with that. However, this employee was caught having packages delivered to the office that weren't just personal packages, but were for the side business. They were also spending time at work making phone calls related to the side business.\n\nAs soon as they were found out, they were let go immediately. Absolutely no hesitation whatsoever. They were gone before lunchtime.", "His behavior is wildly inappropriate.  NTA.", "nta", "NTA\n\nIf a teller did this I would report them. It\u2019s inappropriate and could cost the bank business. His eBay job is for his own time and not to bank customers.", "OK, I'm really not trying to be mean or anything, but you've **been a bank manager for thirty years** and you had to ask a bunch of reddit gremlins if your teller could **operate a retail business through your bank window during his shift**?\n\nNot gonna lie, that feels like a redder flag than anything Jim's doing.", "NTA. He's trying to run his side-hustle on the clock. I'd be incredibly uncomfortable if I went into my bank and had a teller do this, and I'd be downright pissed if I was waiting in line while he tried to sell someone a phone case. He's totally out of line and most businesses would fire him for this. As a millennial manager who ran a side-business for years I would only give one warning and fire him if it happened again.\n\nI was honestly expecting this to be something like handing out a business card or mentioning to customers that he sold Tupperware.", "Very unprofessional. I cant believe this went on as long as it did", "NTA - this could easily get your bank in trouble.", "So easy NTA.\n\nIn fact, he deserves to be fired, both for obviously violating company policy and for his reaction when he was reprimanded.\n\nDon\u2018t fall for the guilt trip surgery thing. Guaranteed EBay guy will do this no matter what his circumstances. It\u2019s not ok and if I was a bank customer, I\u2019d complain about him.", "Completely NTA! This would be a red flag in any decent business.", "NTA\n\nThat is completely inappropriate and unprofessional. It should have been stopped the FIRST time and not something that any executives should have witnessed. He is lucky he has a job at all. Many places would have fired someone for that, especially being so angry when his conduct was addressed.", "So I'm pretty sure what Jim is doing is actually illegal. It's a misrepresentation of the products and services your company offer, and in the process you forcibly assume liability for whatever he sells. If he sells your customers a faulty product, during the normal course of his employment as a representative of your company, and during operation hours? You could be held liable for it instead of him.\n\nNTA. He's lucky you didn't fire him. If he wanted to sell stuff on the side while at work, he should have at least talked to you about it first. It's your place of business to do business at, not some communal marketplace for him to set up booths and list his junk.", "The bank looks bad when you allow this to go on", "NTA.  If he wants to not be poor due to unemployment, then he can sell his products elsewhere. I can't believe you even question yourself here.", "NTA.  The second he flew off the handle and started playing victim should have been the moment you told him his services would no longer be needed and that his final check would be mailed to him.", "NTA. This sounds like it could create a huge set of potential legal headaches. He's handling bank customers' money, but also \"his\" customers' money - and sometimes those are the same people. Yikes.", "NTA at all. Not only is this against policy at most places of employment, it\u2019s harassing the customers or at least making them uncomfortable. \n\nFor your own info, my MIL does this as well. She has it set up as a legitimate business and pays taxes on it. She does it all online, and does not encourage people she knows to buy from her. It becomes shady when it\u2019s not treated as a real job.", "NTA. If the teller tried to sell me anything that is my last day at that bank.", "NTA but why is this guy still employed? He has no concept of boundaries/work etiquette, and seems to have anger issues. As a customer, if I was subjected to this nonsense and he was still there next time I go cash a cheque, I'd be changing banks", ">Around Christmas time, he started selling random products he had at his teller station in the bank during his shift. Every customer that would come to his teller window would get a sales pitch for a painted Yeti cup, phone case, or whatever he had at the time. He would also hound people in the drive-thru about purchasing his items.\n\nTotally inappropriate. He's on company time, not his own time. \n\n>I told him he couldn\u2019t do it anymore, and he lost it. He flew off the handle and accused us (bank management) of wanting him to stay poor. He said he has a surgery he needs desperately, and this was the only way he could get it.\n\nHe should be fired!\n\nNTA", "There\u2019s a reason why side hustles are called that - they are meant to be in the side, separate to their dayjob.  This is so inappropriate and unprofessional. Not to mention it would put me off, as a customer, from frequenting that branch.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t feel guilty about this one.  Anyway, if he\u2019s such a big \u201ceBay guy\u201d, shouldn\u2019t he just be selling this stuff there? \n\nHard NTA.", "So he finds it unbelievable that you are paying him while he is selling his own stuff? And you are wondering if he is right? \n\nGoodness, that's a firing offence in my company.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA, sounds like he'd do better as a mall sunglasses kiosk guy. Then he can hound people to his heart's content. Plus... being an ebay guy doesn't take THAT much time? Like he might have to downsize, but the nature of the game is that it can pretty much happen in the background and you can just get your extra cash picking things up, listing and shipping them in your free time. There's NO reason to bring it to your day job. I hope he's on some sort of probationary period that makes him easier to fire, because it sounds like he's going to be a recurring problem.", "Just because someone is upset, it doesn\u2019t always mean that you\u2019ve wronged them. Sometimes people get upset just because they\u2019re not getting their way. Not getting their way isn\u2019t causing them any actual harm, they just don\u2019t like it. \n\nNTA. If he wants to sell stuff then he is more than free to do it on his own time. He can\u2019t harass customers at work.", "NTA. I would find another bank branch if that happened to me. I want the least amount of interaction at a bank. It\u2019s already stressful enough. It could be costing them business.", "Fire his ass", "NTA, it's completely inappropriate. I would be pissed if I went to the bank and the teller tried to pressure me to buy junk.", "you are 100% NTA for prohibiting this, its really just basic common sense and is totally reasonable grounds to be angry over and is something any competent manager of any kind of business would prohibit. \n\nhowever, is he a full time employee? and if so, why does he need to sell trinkets on the side to pay for a medical procedure? im not saying you are the asshole here, but if this guy is working full time and genuinely cannot pay for a medical procedure due to low wages and/or lack of employer provided insurance, then someone or some people in your company are 100% the asshole, and its not him.", "NTA. He could\u2019ve cost your bank customers. I would\u2019ve not wanted to do business with a bank that allowed this. He can get as mad as he wants (my grandma would\u2019ve said he can just get glad again.).\n\nAlso, if he\u2019s that desperate I\u2019d be afraid he\u2019d mishandle funds.", "Not the A.  I also run a company and I would never let any of my employees pull this shit with my clients,  sure if you have something on the side, keep it on the side.  Or find a new job!!!", "I would wonder if it could open your bank up to some kind of legal risk (IANAL!) but if someone buys something from a teller at your bank i can see someone making a case that they might think they were buying it from the bank and in some case sue you over it. (probably not the biggest risk but it seems plausible to me)", "NTA.  If that was my bank, I\u2019d avoid him like the plague & probably change branches.  I go to my bank to do my banking & leave.  I do not have the time, nor the inclination, to entertain any sales pitch.", "NTA\n\nAs a bank customer, I would actively avoid him. No shame in having a side gig but hounding people at your real job about it is inappropriate.", "He uses eBay. He can literally list stuff on eBay in the morning and it'll do its thing while he's at work. It's very unprofessional what he's doing. \n\nNTA", "NTA This is a bank, this is incredibly unprofessional. Banks have to appear perfect, because banks operate on the fact their clients trust them with their money. If a bank starts to lose customer trust, then you get panic mass withdrawals. I wouldn't bank with the company anymore if I had that teller. I want complete confidence in how my money is being handled.", "NTA. Your compliance department would have a field day with this. And if there was some sort of dispute oh dear Lord.", "Genuinely surprised he hasn't been fired.\n\nNTA\n\nI understand his medical bills but still absolutely not and he should have checked with his boss.", "NTA, I wouldn't trust a banking establishment that was trying to sell me something as I was withdrawing money. That's like shoeshine in the 1940s shit.", "YTA,\n\nYou should be paying Jim more, & better benefits.  If Jim is having to run a side hustle at work in order to pay for a surgery then your bank doesn't pay enough.", "I work at a bank, our rules are so strict. I can't imagine why he hasn't been fired. Like this is so unprofessional, I couldn't imagine doing that at work", "Yeah that's a non negotiable. They purchase your labour exclusively. A side hustle needs to be on the side for that reason. \n\nThat he wasn't fired is testament to your niceness OP because I would avoid anywhere that ever happened to me. \n\nYou honestly might need to improve your feedback system if no one complained about this.", "WOW talk about entitled, fire his ass!", "NTA. OP, if a bank employee did this to me, I'd probably file a complaint. Plus, let's say someone buys something, then he's stuffing money in his pocket, right? This would just be a HUGE mess. I'm shocked this guy wasn't fired.", "This!!!", "I was expecting talking to co-workers about buying tamales from his wife, or gift wrap for his kids fundraiser. Normal things reasonable people try to get away with at work that are technically against policy.", "He already got the warning, and he \"flew off the handle\" instead of saying that he'd stop. It's time to fire him, IMO.", "Not OP, but assuming if this is in the US, even if the job comes with benefits, not every place has good benefits and even with insurance, depending on the surgery, there could still be a hefty out of pocket cost. Also, even though he says he needs it, without knowing exactly what it is, in reality it might be an elective surgery, which insurance may not cover at all.", "Even if the company provides no benefits, that\u2019s not the customers fault. It\u2019s so wildly inappropriate and rude to hound these poor people just looking to use their bank. It can also be considered taking advantage of people. Many of the people here that stuff go in-person to banks are elderly people who aren\u2019t comfortable doing it online, and he\u2019s hounding potentially vulnerable people. He should honestly be gone if he\u2019s doing this just a few months into working there.", "OP doesn\u2019t own the bank and doesn\u2019t decide how much he gets paid. And no matter what, no matter how shitty the company is, that isn\u2019t the fault of the customers and it\u2019s vile of him to be hounding them and taking advantage of his position to target people. \n\nIf the job is shit, get a new one or complain to the company. You don\u2019t take advantage of customers.", "Don't most banks have drive thru? All the ones I've known have.", "I'd probably give the bank one chance to fire the AH or otherwise make them stop before switching (because switching is a PITA) but if it didn't yeah that's worth leaving heh", "I don't want any bank employee hounding me for buying their stuff. It's absolutely unacceptable. This needs to be stopped and reported ASAP. NTA.", "I just had a brilliant (yet horrible it's necessary) idea... \"No Solicitation\" tshirts.", "She sounds absolutely insane! She demanded the next 4 months holiday pay?! What kind of mental gymnastics is that?? \ud83e\udd74 did you ever get the equipment back? I hope you filed a police report against her and her husband for the threats at least.", "At this point, if she has not brought back that equipment, you could look into charging her with theft.", "I'm surprised it took so long to tell Jim what he is doing is wrong and against policy. That crap should've lasted about one day before \"pulling the plug\" on his selling. In fact, the upper management should've NEVER seen it. That's why you have policies so you don't have to think this through or second-guess.", "Same.  Banks rules are very strict.  I can't even read my personal email while signed in.", "His surgery isn\u2019t actually the issue.  He wants it to be the issue.  It\u2019s not.  You don\u2019t work for one business and use the resources of that business (time, resources, customers) for a different business.  It doesn\u2019t matter if aliens are invading the earth or he needs surgery - these are to be kept separate.  Focusing on what he \u201ccould\u201d do is wrong - he is required to not do this while on duty at your bank.", "this year they changed the rules so that anyone who makes more than $600 on ebay sales gets taxed. I think it even gets taxed as though it were income. it sounds like he was caught with his pants down holding a bunch of junk and thought he could avoid the fees by selling in person. what a dingus.", "If I was a customer, I wouldn\u2019t complain. I would never visit again or try to switch banks if necessary. If this happened multiple times to the same customer, the customer probably thinks management is complicit and would never want to bank there again.", "If he's blatantly selling stuff from his teller desk I would assume management is OK with it and not bother complaining. I've complained enough to bad managers to learn not to bother anymore (like when my plate of food comes smeared with an unrelated, dried on substance from the last customer and the manager tells me I'm being \"picky.\")", "And the funny thing is when I was a teller 20 years ago, we were told to push referrals like crazy. We were supposed to force our little old customers to talk to the investment guy or open new lines of credit or whatever product they were pushing then. I always felt bad giving a sales pitch to these customers who just wanted to, as you say, cash their check or make a deposit and go on their way. If they wanted a sales pitch, they could go to the local used car dealership.", "Your daughter is a very smart person. In your position I would make sure I very diligently recorded every aspect of your interaction, especially the parts where he was acting irrationally - this dude seems like the suing type, so it\u2019s best to have all of your paperwork in order before it gets to that point.\n\nNTA and good luck!", "Or the little bars of Whitaker\u2019s chocolate for kid\u2019s school fundraisers", "Absolutely!

Lol. \u201cHave you heard about our new overdraft servic\u2026.\u201d. Nope, not interested.", "Hahaha, I know, right?", "I mean, anyone who walks into a bank and *doesn\u2019t* think that the bank is selling you \u201cproducts\u201d is just not paying attention.
