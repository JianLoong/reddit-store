And if you factor in that half of those vacation costs were actually spent on yourself, it's even less (.035% vs .1%).\n\nIf you have mixed feelings, I think it's important to sit down with your partner and articulate exactly what about the gift rubbed you wrong and what your expectations are for next time.

I.e. was it somewhere they had mentioned wanting to see before, or was it somewhere you had wanted to go?\n\n\nEdit: Below reply has let me know this was answered (it was somewhere the partner wanted to go)\n\n\nDespite that I still think it's a bit of an ESH situation; (depending on how long they are together) the financial disparity is huge, and it's not irrelevant that OPs partner has essentially no housing security of their own if OP is paying for and owns it all (some common law spouse stuff may apply but thay oftem involves a cost to access and if they broke up 5k would be eaten in soliticors fees if they do have some entitlement to the effective family home).\n\n\nTo see it from a position of their means dictating the spend:\n\nPartner paid ($5 of 5000) 0.1 percent of their savings on the  gift OP wanted (if it was just $5)\nOP paid  (3.5k of 1000000) which works out at 0.35 of their worth\nIf the partner had gotten something of equal worth to their means, they would have had to spend 70% of everything they have. It can be extremely difficult for folk who don't earn as much to keep up with the generosity of a partner who has so much more financial stability than they do; no matter what the partner bought it was always going to pale in comparison to OPs gift, without long-term financially fucking the partner.\n\n\nIt is possible for people who have less, to give a lot more, than those who have more (the monetary cost doesnt denote the inherent cost, or value, of a gift).\n\n\nIf I were OP/partner/both, I'd have tried to keep the gifts at a reasonable limit, and do holidays like that as if they are sharing finances (or a family expense, so to speak) and not as extravagance for birthdays/christmas, so as to avoid the disparity being so obvious to everyone.\n\n\nThat's not to say there shouldn't just generally be a reasonable cap on spending or any mutual financial obligations; but I think OP would have been as unhappy if the partner had spent  the equivalent to them, of available wealth, so 17.50, for the back scratcher.\n\n\nAlso \"mild autism\" is not the phrasing to be using, or the attitude to have, even in just one aspect of that, people often mask their discomfort and I would imagine that with unemployment and dwindling savings, as well as not having shared finances/stability their partner has, is an obviously stressful situation for the partner. \n\n\nIf/as they got what they asked for, I dont think it's as bad as the 'getting their wife a new ironing board cover' trope, but if the partner was aware they had a 3.5k value trip they had wanted being their gift, then I would have hoped they could have stretched to something more than filling the list requirement with a $5 back scratcher.\n\n\nI don't know what household or other things partner may do that are of economic value to OP that they wouldnt do if not with OP, but it strikes me that this may be relevant here, too.\n\n\nIn future I would say stick to something like a $100, or consider sharing finances if you are monogamous and in it for the long haul; Holidays and other things can be gifted as surprises without partner feeling pressure to reciprocate when that would be impossible for them, and in my opinion, surprise gifts given for no reason outside loving the person, can be more meaningful and more appreciated.\n\n\nBest of luck, OP", "First of all \u2018mildly autistic\u2019 .. no .

Yes. I understand why you are disappointed. But your economic situation and hers are very different. You have 200x more what she has and you decided to spend it as you wanted.

None of the family's business if the couple are happy.\n3. Try being Autistic in the job market and come back and talk to us. MOST Autistic people are underemployed or unemployed, no matter what kind of education, degrees, certificates, or skills they have. That's because in most fields, the interview process is designed to hire and promote those who are good at socializing. We...aren't. (At least not in a non-Autistic environment. We have no problem in our own culture.)  And just because someone makes less money than their partner does not mean they dictate how the family's or the partner's money is spent.\n4. Cards are hard because you have to get the words just right. Add to that that a good number of Autistic people also have alexithymia (inability to recognize emotions) to a greater or lesser degree. I can certainly recognize love but it's difficult for me to say that out loud or write it. And lastly on the card issue -- you have to remember to GET a card in advance, and that requires planning, which many of us are not very good at.

The OP knows she is chronically underemployed or unemployed (the majority of Autistic people are, regardless of skills or education) and she knows she doesn't have much money. This means Christmas, birthdays, etc. are likely to be a stressful time because of feeling she needs to meet some nebulous \"target\" of getting the right and appropriate gift(s) using fewer resources than most people have in the first place. Difficulties in time management and planning are also common. I'm lucky if I can get it together to actually get presents before Christmas. Then add to that that I have a spouse who likes to spend (and who also makes significantly more than I do, even now after he's retired and I am not). So I'm always second-guessing and feeling inferior to his effort and gifts, the same time as I'm thinking that many are impractical, too expensive for what they are, or just a performative waste of money. \n\nMany Autistic people also interpret speech quite literally. If the OP happened to answer \"What do you want for Christmas?\" by saying \"A backscratcher\" and figure she would \"realize\" somehow that that isn't all she \"should\" buy, she just did what he told her he wanted to. It seems silly to a non-Autistic person but again, \\*\\*we think differently\\*\\*. We say what we mean and mean what we say (which is why we're constantly being zapped for being \"too honest\" or \"blunt\") and we sometimes wrongly expect that non-Autistics will, too.\n\nI would not equate the low cost of the gift to a lack of feeling or effort or respect for the OP.

I don't know the duration of the trip, but they must have been paying quite a lot for accomodations and such. If OP had wanted, he could have not gone along with the idea, booked them a cheaper hotel, or suggested a cheaper location.\n\nSince this could easily have been a less expensive vacation, OP was fine with spending that amount of money, and given gf's financial situation, it's just unfair of him to resent a thoughtful gift.

It can be hard to gift somebody something when you feel like they literally have everything already. It actually makes her gift seem more thoughtful because she knew it was something you wanted but hadn't gotten for yourself, and it was something manageable considering her finances. It's nice to know she at least listens to the things you say. She even put time into finding it, not like she grabbed it last minute to not be empty handed. \n\nIt'd be really hard to get you a gift that compared to the one you gave her.

She could be 50 years old and it would make no difference to the fact that she has no job and a small amount of money that is rapidly running out.  The fact that you seriously think 5K \"lasts pretty long\" suggests you have little to no experience of living on a tight budget.  This woman pays 10% of their living expenses - according to google the average household's monthly expenses are $5577 - if she's paying 10% then her money will run out completely in 8 months.  But given OP's fortune and attitude I expect their living expenses are higher than the average - which means she'll run out and be completely penniless in far less than 8 months.  If their relationship ends she'll need a deposit, rent, utilities, food, etc - that 5K might not last one month.
