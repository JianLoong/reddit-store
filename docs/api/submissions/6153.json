We stayed at a five-star luxury resort and I paid about $7,000 for everything. To be fair, my partner's portion would be valued about $3,500 and not $7,000 which was for two people.\n\nUpon our return, my partner gave me MY Christmas present and it was a $5 back scratcher. To be fair, I have been looking for a good back scratcher and my partner spent many days looking for this one, which works pretty well.\n\nBut my friends and family have been very critical over the HUGE financial imbalance of our respective Christmas presents. To date, I have not defended my partner against this criticism since I have mixed feelings myself. Yet I fully understand it's the thought that counts in the end.\n\nMore context. My partner is mildly autistic and currently unemployed with limited savings (>$5,000). I took forced early retirement last year due to COVID hospitalization but have healthy savings ($1 million+). We live together and I willingly pay 90% of our living costs. We are a happy couple overall.\n\nEDIT:  The entire vacation was my partner's idea. I would have been happy with a staycation myself.

You each spent what you could comfortably afford, which is what you need to tell people who are butting in on your gifting habits.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about the spending imbalance, you need to meet your partner at her financial level for future gifts.", "If you look at the gift as a function of available assets, you actually spent less on your gift to your partner (.07% of your net worth vs .1% of hers). And if you factor in that half of those vacation costs were actually spent on yourself, it's even less (.035% vs .1%).\n\nIf you have mixed feelings, I think it's important to sit down with your partner and articulate exactly what about the gift rubbed you wrong and what your expectations are for next time. Clearly time and care was put into it. It was a thoughtful thing you've been wanting. So are you expecting $50 in presents next year? Four gifts? An equivalent tropical vacation? Seems like you need to spend some time defining your expectations.\n\nNAH", "I think the question really is do YOU actually care or are you letting your friends and family influence your decision. I mean, $1mil vs less than $5k is an INSANE difference. And that money of hers is probably going to your day-to-day life, and which would you rather have, honestly - her helping pay for the regular expenses that she can, etc. or a fancy present that'll deplete her savings? If she did have the money would you expect something more extravagant? Hard to have a judgement on this one because you don't seem to know what you feel yourself.", "YTA - if you\u2019re going to compare the dollar amount of gifts and it\u2019s important to you for it to be even, date someone who has the same amount of money as you.", "YWBTA \n\nBreak up with her if you don't want to be with her but if you know you are dating someone with no job and less than 5k to their name how can you also expect them to match your 3.5k present budget?", "YTA. You knew you would outspend her. And now you are upset because she didn\u2019t spend enough on you. \n\nYour friends and family wouldn\u2019t know the cost-of-gift disparity if you didn\u2019t tell them. They could easily have assumed that your partner paid her own way. But you made a point of telling them $3,500 vs $5 gift cost difference.  So, what was your point in making certain anyone who would listen would know how generous you were and how cheap she was?\n\nDid she even want to go to Cancun for Christmas?  Or was it something important to you, so you bought what you wanted than told her it was a gift for her. Also, not everyone wants to go to a beach for a vacation.  \n\nDoes she like it when you give her extravagant gifts?  Gift giving is NOT my love language and I would be very uncomfortable accepting a gift that was so far beyond my ability to match.  But even if it were a love language, getting an expensive gift for someone than crowing about how much you spent completely invalidates the gift.", "Yta - it was probably so hard for your partner to do that research and find the thing they thought would make you happy. Also the trip was definitely for both of you. Not just them. You could have not done a trip and just done presents instead. That was a choice. You\u2019ve made a choice to support your partner and it sounds like you just want to hold it over them as control for the HUGE financial imbalance. You should have defended them. \n\nIf you\u2019re happy just be happy. Stop letting others interfere.", "YWBTA. You knew when you spent $3,500 on her part of your joint holiday that there was no possibility of her reciprocating. Even if she had spent $50 or $100 on your gift, the imbalance would still be huge. Why then are you now butthurt that the only possible outcome of this situation was the outcome that happened? Why are you not similarly upset that you pay 90% of your joint living costs? If you choose to have a relationship with someone who is in a different life stage to you with significantly different financial resources, you have to accept all that comes with that.", "An autistic person may not recognize that such a financial imbalance in gift giving could be a point of criticism. \n\nAnd with different financial resources she may have felt that there was no way she could give anything of similar financial value and may have felt unable to try.\n\nBetter to talk over budgets and stick to it.  Valentines gift limit is $30, not including a meal.  Or birthday is a $100 maximum. Whatever works for both of you.\n\nAs to cmthe present situation,  a soft YTA. \n\nGiven financial situation you reasonably should have known there would be a huge imbalance. You just didn't quite know the extent of it.", "Hard to judge.  only your feelings matter and it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a huge imbalance in finances. No job means no income so I can see why the cheap gift. With that said it was one that you like and use. They clearly put effort into getting something they knew you\u2019d use that they could afford. They have $5000 to their name? You could dump them tomorrow and that\u2019s all they have. So spending money has to be anxiety inducing.", "YTA - your partner spent time picking out something that you would really like.\n\nYou spent a lot of money on a holiday for you both. \n\nDon't blame all this on your family,; you had the same feelings.", "INFO: Did your partner want to go on the holiday with you? I.e. was it somewhere they had mentioned wanting to see before, or was it somewhere you had wanted to go?", "First of all \u2018mildly autistic\u2019 .. no . They\u2019re autistic that\u2019s it \n\nSecondly .. you should never give with expectations.. They got you a gift and you got them a gift . That\u2019s pretty much it", "Why are your friends and family involved in any way in your finances?", "You got your SO something that was for both of you, and SO got something special just for you. But you and your family are criticizing\u2026 why? YTA. And your family.", "INFO: Was there any discussion about money before hand? And was the trip a suprise? \n\nIt sounds like you're pretty aware of the financial differences yall have. You WBTA if you made her feel super bad about it.", "Yeah, YWBTA.\n\nIn practice, your living situation is such that you pay for living, and that includes holidays.  You paid for your holiday to Cancun as a couple, like I imagine you pay for all your holidays.  Why'd you brand that as a Christmas present from you to her?  You should have separately got her an actual present.\n\nShe on the other hand actually searched for something for you that is a present specifically for you.  So in my book, it's her that has the moral high ground here.\n\nHappy to explain this to the extended family and friends, if for some mad reason they are *really* bothered by this.", "Ywbta. Balance or fairness does not come down to monetary value. A Christmas gift is only one tiny part of one day of a relationship. \n\nPlease get some perspective.", "Well, just let that one go.  I read the whole post and I see the various factors in play. Your girlfriend can\u2019t get you a similar gift.  I assume your friends are not aware of some of the factors you mentioned.  Please don\u2019t compare the gifts because you would be . . .", "Cool story", "I mean, just because you call a vacation a Christmas present doesn\u2019t really make it one. Why don\u2019t you get her a $5 hand cream or something, call that your equal gift, and then just enjoy the fact that you paid for both of you to enjoy a nice destination getaway.", "YTA. You bought a young wife. This is what you paid for.  Not to mention, you're both unemployed at really young ages. Hate to break it to you but unless +$1million means like $20 million in savings and not $1.5 million but you cannot afford this lifestyle for 30 odd years for you and 45 odd years for her.", "ESH\n\n1. Your partner asking for such a lavish vacation when she has no money. That\u2019s a red flag\n\n2. Your family for getting involved but again I would be questioning the relationship.\n\n3. You got being in a relationship with someone whom doesn\u2019t have a job and allowing her to dictate how you spend your money.\n\n\nShe could have spent $20 bucks on you or at least a dang card.", "YWBTA- Gifts are something given with nothing expected in return. You are well off enough to spend on lavish gifts and she isn't. You said yourself that she put thought into picking the gift. That should be enough for you. \n\nIf you are giving lavish things and expecting the same in return, you're with the wrong person. She is low income. If you're happy with her but insist on expecting the same type of gifts in return, then start giving her a gift in the price range that she can afford so you aren't let down.", "YTA. \n\nI agree that a $5 backscratcher is not a great Christmas present, but to act like she had some obligation to get something comparable to a 7 day luxury vacation that you decided on your own to pay for is loonytoons.   People in happy relationships don\u2019t keep score like that.\n\nI\u2019ve had a few boyfriends - not even living together, who simply just paid for our vacations together because they had the money and wanted to do something nice.   They never framed it as a holiday or birthday gift, more like, \u201cwe need a vacation, let me know when you can take a week off.\u201d   I can\u2019t imagine the stress and anxiety it would have caused me to feel like I needed to pay them back in some way.", "YTA. Yes. I understand why you are disappointed. But your economic situation and hers are very different. You have 200x more what she has and you decided to spend it as you wanted. Meanwhile, she took her time looking for the perfect thing you have been wanting, something of good quality and functional. She is autistic and poor. This is important for this situation. She gave you exactly what she thought you needed and if it serves you right, and looked for one for days.\n\nWhat did you want her to get you? Do you think you would be happy if she gave you a $50 gift? Or $100? When you know it is money she needs in the future? Or are you upset because other people are telling you this? It's clear you don't want a thoughtful gift. What gift did you expect her to buy?\n\nYour effort was monetary. Her effort was emotional. To you, that is a false equivalent. To me, it really isn't. \n\nI think the worst part is that you don't defend her, knowing everything you know about your partner. You are letting people say shit about her because you wanted a bug gesture from someone who has no income.", "YTA and your family are assholes.\nWho cares what it costs? Would you have had as much fun on the trip without her? She didn't ask for a $7k trip, you got it.  Nice thing for you to do until you made it about money. Take her on another expensive trip without bitching to make up for it.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA only because once you explain the finances, it\u2019s clear you can do things like spend 7 grand on a trip, and they have to ration the savings they have.", "INFO What amount do you think she should have spent on you?", "YTA", "NAH. I don't think it's the right sub, nobody here is an ass hole. \n\nIf you're a happy couple, who cares. I'm sure they would have bought you something more expensive if you asked, but you they gave you exactly what you asked for. What your family thinks about your \"financial burden\" means nothing. My mom hasn't worked in 35 years, but she still \"buys\" gifts for my dad. Where do you think she gets her money from?", "YWBTA. The correct answer here is to not call expensive vacation trips a Christmas gift, or call it \"our present to ourselves\" -- nobody but the two of you needs to know who spent what on that. \n\nEach of you can spend five bucks on fun gifts to open. Or even a bunch of them, whatever. \n\nEveryone else can shut their traps.", "Sometimes you got it and other times you don\u2019t. Hold off next year", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s the thought that counts, additional while you can choose to take her on a vacation you also can\u2019t expect her to spend irresponsibly (which is she is jobless and has limited savings a large gift would be) because you purchased a large gift.\n\nEdited for phrasing", "YWBTA.\n\nA vacation to celebrate a holiday is something a family does for itself, even if one person contributes more than the other or even all of the expenses due to income inequalities.\n\nYou're looking at it the wrong way. Your friends and extended family are not only looking at it the wrong way, but completely without the compassion toward those who are in need and the good will toward all people that Christmas is really about.", "NTA as long as you aren\u2019t focusing on the money aspect so much. Is it the cost of the gift that bugs you, or the lack of effort? There are tons of thoughtful gift ideas that are not expensive. If she spent time and effort making something thoughtful for you that costed $5, would you still feel this way?", "YTA\n\nYou and your partner currently have a huge financial disparity between you and then everyone is surprised when there is a huge financial disparity in your gifts. Um, duh.\n\nWhile your gift was generous, it was also probably stressful since they're unemployed and you bought a trip more than their entire savings. You knew the situation, you two should have talked about this leading up to the holidays.", "ESH. Partner should\u2019ve spent more than five dollars on you, even if she got two or three backscratchers. Or she got some oils or lotions. Or got you a nice box of chocolates or a bottle of wine or a gift card to a retail store or something. Maybe spend 50 bucks?\n\nBut the fact that you dropped seven gees on a vacation has nothing to do with that.\n\nGiven her situation, she\u2019s not going to be able to come anywhere close to what you spent; so it\u2019s ridiculous to even factor it into the equation. But you definitely have the right to be disappointed that she only spent five dollars on you.", "You would be NTA \n\nSeems you are her sugar dady $$$\n\nShe should have gave you something more \"thoughtful\" (it\u00b4s not about money) but put the effort and try to balance it out since she is receiving so much already. \n\nYou even pay 90% for living costs. If you don't mind the huge gap, let it be. But maybe talk to her about how it makes you feel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
