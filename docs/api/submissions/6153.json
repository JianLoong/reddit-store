And if you factor in that half of those vacation costs were actually spent on yourself, it's even less (.035% vs .1%).\n\nIf you have mixed feelings, I think it's important to sit down with your partner and articulate exactly what about the gift rubbed you wrong and what your expectations are for next time.

I.e. was it somewhere they had mentioned wanting to see before, or was it somewhere you had wanted to go?\n\n\nEdit: Below reply has let me know this was answered (it was somewhere the partner wanted to go)\n\n\nDespite that I still think it's a bit of an ESH situation; (depending on how long they are together) the financial disparity is huge, and it's not irrelevant that OPs partner has essentially no housing security of their own if OP is paying for and owns it all (some common law spouse stuff may apply but thay oftem involves a cost to access and if they broke up 5k would be eaten in soliticors fees if they do have some entitlement to the effective family home).\n\n\nTo see it from a position of their means dictating the spend:\n\nPartner paid ($5 of 5000) 0.1 percent of their savings on the  gift OP wanted (if it was just $5)\nOP paid  (3.5k of 1000000) which works out at 0.35 of their worth\nIf the partner had gotten something of equal worth to their means, they would have had to spend 70% of everything they have. It can be extremely difficult for folk who don't earn as much to keep up with the generosity of a partner who has so much more financial stability than they do; no matter what the partner bought it was always going to pale in comparison to OPs gift, without long-term financially fucking the partner.\n\n\nIt is possible for people who have less, to give a lot more, than those who have more (the monetary cost doesnt denote the inherent cost, or value, of a gift).\n\n\nIf I were OP/partner/both, I'd have tried to keep the gifts at a reasonable limit, and do holidays like that as if they are sharing finances (or a family expense, so to speak) and not as extravagance for birthdays/christmas, so as to avoid the disparity being so obvious to everyone.\n\n\nThat's not to say there shouldn't just generally be a reasonable cap on spending or any mutual financial obligations; but I think OP would have been as unhappy if the partner had spent  the equivalent to them, of available wealth, so 17.50, for the back scratcher.\n\n\nAlso \"mild autism\" is not the phrasing to be using, or the attitude to have, even in just one aspect of that, people often mask their discomfort and I would imagine that with unemployment and dwindling savings, as well as not having shared finances/stability their partner has, is an obviously stressful situation for the partner. \n\n\nIf/as they got what they asked for, I dont think it's as bad as the 'getting their wife a new ironing board cover' trope, but if the partner was aware they had a 3.5k value trip they had wanted being their gift, then I would have hoped they could have stretched to something more than filling the list requirement with a $5 back scratcher.\n\n\nI don't know what household or other things partner may do that are of economic value to OP that they wouldnt do if not with OP, but it strikes me that this may be relevant here, too.\n\n\nIn future I would say stick to something like a $100, or consider sharing finances if you are monogamous and in it for the long haul; Holidays and other things can be gifted as surprises without partner feeling pressure to reciprocate when that would be impossible for them, and in my opinion, surprise gifts given for no reason outside loving the person, can be more meaningful and more appreciated.\n\n\nBest of luck, OP", "First of all \u2018mildly autistic\u2019 .. no .

Yes. I understand why you are disappointed. But your economic situation and hers are very different. You have 200x more what she has and you decided to spend it as you wanted.

None of the family's business if the couple are happy.\n3. Try being Autistic in the job market and come back and talk to us. MOST Autistic people are underemployed or unemployed, no matter what kind of education, degrees, certificates, or skills they have. That's because in most fields, the interview process is designed to hire and promote those who are good at socializing. We...aren't. (At least not in a non-Autistic environment. We have no problem in our own culture.)  And just because someone makes less money than their partner does not mean they dictate how the family's or the partner's money is spent.\n4. Cards are hard because you have to get the words just right. Add to that that a good number of Autistic people also have alexithymia (inability to recognize emotions) to a greater or lesser degree. I can certainly recognize love but it's difficult for me to say that out loud or write it. And lastly on the card issue -- you have to remember to GET a card in advance, and that requires planning, which many of us are not very good at.

The OP knows she is chronically underemployed or unemployed (the majority of Autistic people are, regardless of skills or education) and she knows she doesn't have much money. This means Christmas, birthdays, etc. are likely to be a stressful time because of feeling she needs to meet some nebulous \"target\" of getting the right and appropriate gift(s) using fewer resources than most people have in the first place. Difficulties in time management and planning are also common. I'm lucky if I can get it together to actually get presents before Christmas. Then add to that that I have a spouse who likes to spend (and who also makes significantly more than I do, even now after he's retired and I am not). So I'm always second-guessing and feeling inferior to his effort and gifts, the same time as I'm thinking that many are impractical, too expensive for what they are, or just a performative waste of money. \n\nMany Autistic people also interpret speech quite literally. If the OP happened to answer \"What do you want for Christmas?\" by saying \"A backscratcher\" and figure she would \"realize\" somehow that that isn't all she \"should\" buy, she just did what he told her he wanted to. It seems silly to a non-Autistic person but again, \\*\\*we think differently\\*\\*. We say what we mean and mean what we say (which is why we're constantly being zapped for being \"too honest\" or \"blunt\") and we sometimes wrongly expect that non-Autistics will, too.\n\nI would not equate the low cost of the gift to a lack of feeling or effort or respect for the OP.

Don't compare numbers.", "Never give and expect...you will always be disappointed.", "Also, if gifts are OP's love language, perhaps they should start a \"fun/spare money\" fund for each of them since it's unrealistic to expect someone with so little available funds to spend a ton on non-necessities. This way, there are readily available funds to purchase gifts with, AND they're not living at vastly different qualities of living.\n\nPeople have different preferences for gifts. For me, I would be thrilled to have received that gift from my husband. It shows your partner listening to you, valuing your wants and needs, and spending a good chunk of their time and energy dedicated to ensuring your happiness. I would feel valued, heard, and loved. My husband got me a lap desk for Christmas. It wasn't really the type I'd have gotten for myself, but he's seen me finding boxes and books to complete paperwork on, saw it on my amazon list (I tend to browse while bored, and add things I like or find useful), and saw it at the store while shopping for me. \n\nHowever, not everyone feels love in that way, so this is where communication becomes crucial. Start with an \"I feel/felt\" statement, vs. \"You didn't/did.\" For example, \"I felt undervalued during Christmas because of the vast inequality of our gifts to each other. I understand and appreciate the time and effort you put into finding me the perfect back scratcher, but I feel more loved when more is spent on me.\" It would help a lot to be able to suggest a possible solution because otherwise, she's going to wind up feeling like you're expecting herself to go broke buying you things while you know she's financially struggling. It sticks her in a situation of feeling unappreciated and stuck because either she's fiscally responsible and cares for her needs, or she makes you happy. Give her a potential option C.", "I don\u2019t like this take. Is a billionaire supposed to buy everyone a mansion just because of his higher net worth? Five dollars is five dollars; it\u2019s nothing. Forget the vacation and forget the OP\u2019s financial situation.\n\nIf girlfriend doesn\u2019t have money, she can make something.", "Why does everything need to be taken to the extreme? It's ridiculous.\n\nIn no way imaginable did he ever imply he expected a 3.5k gift. He literally expressed mixed feelings about only receiving a $5 gift. That's it. Most of us would be given pause over a $5 gift from our partner. It's completely reasonable.\n\nAnd yet you base your entire judgement on an imaginary thesis and go right to talking about breaking up?\n\nAnd your post is popular. This subreddit can be absolutely mental. These are real people you are giving advice to.", "Oh come on.\n\nAlmost every person not in abject poverty would have mixed feelings about receiving only a $5 gift from their spouse or partner.\n\nYour entire post is putting words in his mouth and spinning this in absurd ways.", "It was so hard to research a back scratcher?\n\nNo, no it's not. Not in any possible way is that a difficult task. At all.", "Especially when someone\u2019s autistic. It\u2019s possible she just genuinely might not see it the same way OP does. I\u2019m dense as fuck and it\u2019s helpful to me when people define what they want from me in plain terms rather than drop hints and grow resentful when I don\u2019t pick them up. Agree NAH and that they should probably be defining expectations if the feelings OP has are mixed rather than full negative", "Because it\u2019s a back scratcher?", "Yes! The picture painted here is: gf suggested a vacation. OP wouldn't have done it off his own back but he enjoyed it and it was good bonding time. Gf spent time finding a good present OP wanted.\n\nThis seems entirely equitable, both partners seem happy. The shit-stirrers can bugger off IMO.", "Right. Terrible to use for rubbing, way too scratchy. 1/10.", "I wonder if she proposed it or if it egged it on? That really will weigh the decision.", "Personally, I think the vacation is completely irrelevant. It shouldn\u2019t factor into this at all. The financial situations of the two parties involved are drastically different. So, it would be unfair to expect her to get him a Christmas gift commensurate with his vacation. \n\nAs such, it should be completed disregarded. I just think five dollars is far too low of an amount to spend on one\u2019s significant other."]}
