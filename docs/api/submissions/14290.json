Growing up, he was the golden child. He got a full ride to a prestigious college while I had to pay my own way and eventually drop out. He went on to grad school, but I got married and settled down with my wife, 42F, \u201cBrittany\u201d early on. We have had financial struggles which caused us to not be able to start a family. We live paycheck to paycheck in a one bedroom apartment. Jay always made good money, but wasn\u2019t lucky in love. He was very picky and while he had some longer 1-2 year relationships, he was looking for perfection before getting married. He finally married his wife, 40F, Mary, in 2019. She also made good money, like Jay. She also had 2 children from a previous relationship, now 18 and 19. One is in college and the other will be starting next year. She and Jay also had twin girls about a year ago. Mary and Jay both worked, and have a nanny they share with a neighbor for their girls. When they got pregnant, she sold her house where they were living and he sold his condo that he had been renting out and they bought a larger family home together. All this to say money is not a problem for them. \n\nLike I said, Jay passed away recently in a car accident and Mary found out that I was the beneficiary of his 401(k) and life insurance policy through his employer. The life insurance is 150k but the 401k is much more substantial. He set it up that way years ago before Mary was in the picture and never changed it. \n\nMary begged me to give her a portion of the money but I said no. She inherited his part of their house, and their joint savings account which is about 50k. She said that she paid for his funeral, and to make it work on her income alone, she will have to sell the house, give up the nanny, put the girls in daycare, and won\u2019t be able to help her older kids with college the way they planned. \n\nI told her it\u2019s not my fault. If he wanted to change the beneficiary, he should have done that. But he didn\u2019t so now the money is mine. My wife and I plan to use the money to buy a home and finally start a family. She says her husbands money should go to his children, but she doesn\u2019t see that me using the money to have my own children is more important. \n\nOur parents think I\u2019m an a hole because the money should go to his kids. I offered to take 50k and put it in trust for the girls education. But they said Mary needs the money now. They said the life insurance would pay off their mortgage and the boys college and put money away for the girls future, and her income would cover the rest so they wouldn\u2019t have to move. But what about my family?", "created_utc": 1680968770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fprr9/aita_for_keeping_my_brothers_life_insurance/", "score": 3386, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you've done is fairly vile, and you're now hoping that \"well he never changed the beneficiary information so it's ethically right for me to keep the money\" is sufficient enough argument to win everyone here over. It's not. What you've done is despicable, and there is no outcome here where what you've ***chosen*** to do is ethically or morally acceptable.

But I also think, legally, you are wrong.  Being named as beneficiary doesn't mean that all of that money goes to you. There isn't a will directing all money to you and excluding the others.

While I understand her 2 older kids are college and technically not your blood relatives, you do have twin nieces to think about. You could easily give them the LI money and live off the 401k money. Are you planning on quitting your job and just live off that? That sounds to me like you have poor financial skills and don\u2019t know how to budget correctly. You think this windfall is going to set you for life?

You\u2019re benefiting off of the mistake on his end. \n\nAnd either way, it\u2019s terrible for you to keep that money away from his grieving widow and children. They absolutely do need it more than you. You don\u2019t even have kids yet, you didn\u2019t pay for the funeral, you really have no reason to keep it other than a legal technicality which is a really bad reason.

Growing up, he was the golden child. He got a full ride to a prestigious college while I had to pay my own way and eventually drop out. He went on to grad school, but I got married and settled down with my wife, 42F, \u201cBrittany\u201d early on. We have had financial struggles which caused us to not be able to start a family. We live paycheck to paycheck in a one bedroom apartment. Jay always made good money, but wasn\u2019t lucky in love. He was very picky and while he had some longer 1-2 year relationships, he was looking for perfection before getting married. He finally married his wife, 40F, Mary, in 2019. She also made good money, like Jay. She also had 2 children from a previous relationship, now 18 and 19. One is in college and the other will be starting next year. She and Jay also had twin girls about a year ago. Mary and Jay both worked, and have a nanny they share with a neighbor for their girls. When they got pregnant, she sold her house where they were living and he sold his condo that he had been renting out and they bought a larger family home together. All this to say money is not a problem for them. \n\nLike I said, Jay passed away recently in a car accident and Mary found out that I was the beneficiary of his 401(k) and life insurance policy through his employer. The life insurance is 150k but the 401k is much more substantial. He set it up that way years ago before Mary was in the picture and never changed it. \n\nMary begged me to give her a portion of the money but I said no. She inherited his part of their house, and their joint savings account which is about 50k. She said that she paid for his funeral, and to make it work on her income alone, she will have to sell the house, give up the nanny, put the girls in daycare, and won\u2019t be able to help her older kids with college the way they planned. \n\nI told her it\u2019s not my fault. If he wanted to change the beneficiary, he should have done that. But he didn\u2019t so now the money is mine. My wife and I plan to use the money to buy a home and finally start a family. She says her husbands money should go to his children, but she doesn\u2019t see that me using the money to have my own children is more important. \n\nOur parents think I\u2019m an a hole because the money should go to his kids. I offered to take 50k and put it in trust for the girls education. But they said Mary needs the money now. They said the life insurance would pay off their mortgage and the boys college and put money away for the girls future, and her income would cover the rest so they wouldn\u2019t have to move.

Now, when I was 20 the child tax credits, child maintenance and child benefits stopped (almost all my mum's income) and 18 days later my step dad died which meant that almost all income suddenly stopped. I was severely depressed (undiagnosed at the time) and in college (UK). It was a nightmare financially (and other ways of course). \n\nJust please think of the kids.

I mean you could put some of the money in a trust for the girls and give some to the widow for funeral expenses.   you could also give the life insurance money to Mary to help cover coasts and allow her to figure things out.   and then keep the 401k which you said was a lot.    I think your resentment living paycheck to paycheck and your brothers golden child status has tainted the way you are looking at this situation.  what does your wife think about all of this?", "You're NTA. And it's actually good for the unborn kids you didn't have, because they would have a really shitty life in this destroyed world.\n\nEnjoy your $.", " At least give her the life insurance of 150k, keep the 401k if you must.

If his work is anything like mine, every year they ask us to review our benefits and update beneficiaries.   \nHe obviously chose not to do that and left you as the sole beneficiary.  He didn't even put his wife on as secondary or partial, and that to me seems very intentional.", "You're telling me that you really believe that your brother, if alive, would side with you here in priorities?\n\nNTA from a technical standpoint, but I have a hard time believing that your brother wouldn't want at least half of the sum go to his wife and children.\n\nBut, as I said, you didn't do anything underhanded or sneaky and legally you aren't wrong. NTA, but maybe a tad self centered.", "This whole thing is an ugly mess of your brother's making. Every life insurance and 401k I know of requires a signed form from the spouse if you want to have someone other than them as the primary beneficiary.  And since your brother was married for 4 years and had kids in their late teens he either got his wife to sign the forms or he was chosing to not update his marital status with the life insurance and 401k.  If they are through his employer then as soon as he notified HR so they can update their paperwork , HR would have passed on the information. So barring massive incompetence for four years on HR's part you are left with three options 1) your SIL signed the form letting you continue to be the primary beneficiary 2) your brother never actually legally married your SIl or 3) your brother was actively doing something to keep his marriage hidden form his administrators of his 401k and life insurance.

OP is now learning my own maxim: you either work your ass off for 8+ years (HS then college) or will be working your ass off for the rest of your fucking life. You do the math.\n\nAlso, OP needs to hear the harsh truth: his wife is too old at this point to have kids if she's never had them before. After mid-30s, first time pregnancies get more & more problematic. My own then 40ish SIL & brother discovered this the hard way when she had my niece 6 weeks premature and it was touch & go if she would survive (she's 10 now, thankfully). \n\nEven if they were younger, I have a feeling if OP honestly asks himself \"Would Jay want me to keep the money or give it to his wife\" he knows Jay would want it all to go to his family. Clearly, at no time did Jay tell OP \"no matter what happens later, whether I get married or not, I want you to have my 401K money for you & your wife. I know you could use it to make your life a little better, brother.\"\n\nBut it seems that OP is making himself look like a total dick for no reason: several are pointing out that he would likely lose any court case over the money. At what I'm guessing is about **half a million dollars** the widow is going to have no problem finding a good lawyer to get most of it back after attorney's fees. \n\n**PSA - IF YOU HAVE KIDS AND/OR MAJOR ASSETS YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE  A WILL**\n\nLearn from Jay's mistake. In most/all states a spouse automatically gets everything upon other spouse's death, so your family members will be her mercy if there's no will. But once you have kids, you really want them and any other beloved family members taken care of in accordance what you want, not what the spouse thinks is fair. Never doubt that money can change people. If it hadn't been for the fact that my brother and I were named on several life insurance policies, my dad's horrible last wife would have not given us anything.
