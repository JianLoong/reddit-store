Growing up, he was the golden child. He got a full ride to a prestigious college while I had to pay my own way and eventually drop out. He went on to grad school, but I got married and settled down with my wife, 42F, \u201cBrittany\u201d early on. We have had financial struggles which caused us to not be able to start a family. We live paycheck to paycheck in a one bedroom apartment. Jay always made good money, but wasn\u2019t lucky in love. He was very picky and while he had some longer 1-2 year relationships, he was looking for perfection before getting married. He finally married his wife, 40F, Mary, in 2019. She also made good money, like Jay. She also had 2 children from a previous relationship, now 18 and 19. One is in college and the other will be starting next year. She and Jay also had twin girls about a year ago. Mary and Jay both worked, and have a nanny they share with a neighbor for their girls. When they got pregnant, she sold her house where they were living and he sold his condo that he had been renting out and they bought a larger family home together. All this to say money is not a problem for them. \n\nLike I said, Jay passed away recently in a car accident and Mary found out that I was the beneficiary of his 401(k) and life insurance policy through his employer. The life insurance is 150k but the 401k is much more substantial. He set it up that way years ago before Mary was in the picture and never changed it. \n\nMary begged me to give her a portion of the money but I said no. She inherited his part of their house, and their joint savings account which is about 50k. She said that she paid for his funeral, and to make it work on her income alone, she will have to sell the house, give up the nanny, put the girls in daycare, and won\u2019t be able to help her older kids with college the way they planned. \n\nI told her it\u2019s not my fault. If he wanted to change the beneficiary, he should have done that. But he didn\u2019t so now the money is mine. My wife and I plan to use the money to buy a home and finally start a family. She says her husbands money should go to his children, but she doesn\u2019t see that me using the money to have my own children is more important. \n\nOur parents think I\u2019m an a hole because the money should go to his kids. I offered to take 50k and put it in trust for the girls education. But they said Mary needs the money now. They said the life insurance would pay off their mortgage and the boys college and put money away for the girls future, and her income would cover the rest so they wouldn\u2019t have to move. But what about my family?", "created_utc": 1680968770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fprr9/aita_for_keeping_my_brothers_life_insurance/", "score": 514, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even though you legally own the money, Jay also already have his own childern. Why use Jay's money to fund your family and not Jay's own?

At the end of the day, your brother's commitment was doubtlessly to his family before yours, after all, he was paying their bills, not yours. What you've done is fairly vile, and you're now hoping that \"well he never changed the beneficiary information so it's ethically right for me to keep the money\" is sufficient enough argument to win everyone here over. It's not. What you've done is despicable, and there is no outcome here where what you've ***chosen*** to do is ethically or morally acceptable.

It sucks that you had a much harder life than he did, but that\u2019s no excuse for what you\u2019re doing now. You actively hurting your sister in law and nieces, and all for your own gain. I really hope you realize how fucked up this is and give Mary her husband\u2019s money. Otherwise I suspect you will not only lose her and the nieces as family but your parents as well.

But I also think, legally, you are wrong.  Being named as beneficiary doesn't mean that all of that money goes to you. There isn't a will directing all money to you and excluding the others.  There are typically state laws about next of kin, and spouse is first, child is second, parent is third, and sibling is fourth... etc etc aunts/uncles, cousins rah rah rah.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s clear you didn\u2019t even like your brother and your motives are purely about the money.

But your the AH because they did have children together. You say that the LI is 150k and the 401k is substantially more. While I understand her 2 older kids are college and technically not your blood relatives, you do have twin nieces to think about. You could easily give them the LI money and live off the 401k money. Are you planning on quitting your job and just live off that? That sounds to me like you have poor financial skills and don\u2019t know how to budget correctly. You think this windfall is going to set you for life? Yes children are expensive and the housing market isn\u2019t that great but if if more than 300k than you can easily make that last a long time if you budget right.", "\"She doesn't see that me using [Jay's] money for my kids is more important\".\n\nBecause it isn't.\n\n\"But what about my family?\"\n\nWhat about it?

You\u2019re benefiting off of the mistake on his end. \n\nAnd either way, it\u2019s terrible for you to keep that money away from his grieving widow and children. They absolutely do need it more than you. You don\u2019t even have kids yet, you didn\u2019t pay for the funeral, you really have no reason to keep it other than a legal technicality which is a really bad reason.

Growing up, he was the golden child. He got a full ride to a prestigious college while I had to pay my own way and eventually drop out. He went on to grad school, but I got married and settled down with my wife, 42F, \u201cBrittany\u201d early on. We have had financial struggles which caused us to not be able to start a family. We live paycheck to paycheck in a one bedroom apartment. Jay always made good money, but wasn\u2019t lucky in love. He was very picky and while he had some longer 1-2 year relationships, he was looking for perfection before getting married. He finally married his wife, 40F, Mary, in 2019. She also made good money, like Jay. She also had 2 children from a previous relationship, now 18 and 19. One is in college and the other will be starting next year. She and Jay also had twin girls about a year ago. Mary and Jay both worked, and have a nanny they share with a neighbor for their girls. When they got pregnant, she sold her house where they were living and he sold his condo that he had been renting out and they bought a larger family home together. All this to say money is not a problem for them. \n\nLike I said, Jay passed away recently in a car accident and Mary found out that I was the beneficiary of his 401(k) and life insurance policy through his employer. The life insurance is 150k but the 401k is much more substantial. He set it up that way years ago before Mary was in the picture and never changed it. \n\nMary begged me to give her a portion of the money but I said no. She inherited his part of their house, and their joint savings account which is about 50k. She said that she paid for his funeral, and to make it work on her income alone, she will have to sell the house, give up the nanny, put the girls in daycare, and won\u2019t be able to help her older kids with college the way they planned. \n\nI told her it\u2019s not my fault. If he wanted to change the beneficiary, he should have done that. But he didn\u2019t so now the money is mine. My wife and I plan to use the money to buy a home and finally start a family. She says her husbands money should go to his children, but she doesn\u2019t see that me using the money to have my own children is more important. \n\nOur parents think I\u2019m an a hole because the money should go to his kids. I offered to take 50k and put it in trust for the girls education. But they said Mary needs the money now. They said the life insurance would pay off their mortgage and the boys college and put money away for the girls future, and her income would cover the rest so they wouldn\u2019t have to move.

I mean you could put some of the money in a trust for the girls and give some to the widow for funeral expenses.   you could also give the life insurance money to Mary to help cover coasts and allow her to figure things out.   and then keep the 401k which you said was a lot.    I think your resentment living paycheck to paycheck and your brothers golden child status has tainted the way you are looking at this situation.  what does your wife think about all of this?", "You're NTA. And it's actually good for the unborn kids you didn't have, because they would have a really shitty life in this destroyed world.\n\nEnjoy your $.", " At least give her the life insurance of 150k, keep the 401k if you must.

If his work is anything like mine, every year they ask us to review our benefits and update beneficiaries.   \nHe obviously chose not to do that and left you as the sole beneficiary.  He didn't even put his wife on as secondary or partial, and that to me seems very intentional.", "You're telling me that you really believe that your brother, if alive, would side with you here in priorities?\n\nNTA from a technical standpoint, but I have a hard time believing that your brother wouldn't want at least half of the sum go to his wife and children.\n\nBut, as I said, you didn't do anything underhanded or sneaky and legally you aren't wrong. NTA, but maybe a tad self centered.", "This whole thing is an ugly mess of your brother's making. Every life insurance and 401k I know of requires a signed form from the spouse if you want to have someone other than them as the primary beneficiary.  And since your brother was married for 4 years and had kids in their late teens he either got his wife to sign the forms or he was chosing to not update his marital status with the life insurance and 401k.  If they are through his employer then as soon as he notified HR so they can update their paperwork , HR would have passed on the information. So barring massive incompetence for four years on HR's part you are left with three options 1) your SIL signed the form letting you continue to be the primary beneficiary 2) your brother never actually legally married your SIl or 3) your brother was actively doing something to keep his marriage hidden form his administrators of his 401k and life insurance.
