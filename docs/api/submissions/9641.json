Where I've worked, the office baby/wedding shower has generally been cake, card, and small gift. Keeps it more doable and also less lopsided. If someone less popular in the office has a baby and doesn't get a $1500 gift, it's going to be very noticeable. Not to mention all the people not getting married/having babies who are expected to fund these huge gifts but get nothing in return.", "> Yeah, you can say they don't have to donate but can you really say that there is no pressure to donate?\n\nThis is where I fall. Whoever chose the stroller put the whole team in a super awkward situation. I bet there are people who paid up who would rather not have spent $75 on a coworker. Yes, even if this is a common gift price on your team. Y'all need to scale it way back, which will be very difficult to do now.", "Yep I\u2019m confused why there are so many votes giving OP the clear. This set up sounds toxic and unprofessional. It\u2019s bullying people into paying money you don\u2019t know if they can afford to spend all because of social expectations.\n\nOffice gifts in my opinion should come from the company or higher ups. Or be personal between office friends. \n\nIt can get expensive buying big gifts for everyone\u2019s life events. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not fair unless it\u2019s just birthday gifts because lots of people contributing may have past those milestones or never plan on having them while they work there so they are shelling out all kinds of cash and never get anything themselves. That can breed resentment. Add in people will start to compare prices on the gifts if it\u2019s not always the same amount spent. Like why did sally get an expensive stroller and all Jane got was a diaper cake. I\u2019d hate working with these people. \n\nThe way your described seems better, but even then it has the potential to backfire or hurt someone when there\u2019s more many raised for one employee over the other. \n\nOffices are for working, we are there to do a job and get paid. If anything involving money happens, it shouldn\u2019t be on employees to fund it. The company/boss does or it doesn\u2019t happen.", "OP clearly stated that one of the non-contributors received a comparably priced gift for his wedding. Please read.", "Did you read the story at all ? It\u2019s common to do things like this where they work.", "OP clearly states the two non-contributing coworkers were reminded two days before the gift giving and they said they\u2019d transfer their contribution immediately. They didn\u2019t. \nPlease read.", "did you even read the story ? she did remind them.", "She might need that information to write thank you cards to people who contributed to her gift.  Why should those two people get credit if they didn't contribute?", "Office politics, so she knows which <departure, birthday...> gift she will not have to fund in the future :p", ">Why not just say out loud \"Here, we pitched in and got you a present\" and leave it at that? \n\nBecause not everyone pitched in and why should they get any credit? Its handy to know because, one day they might have a child, this pregnant woman might not want to contribute for their gift.", "This.", ">they shouldn't be left out because of this\n\nOf course they should. Why would they get credit if they didn't chip in?", "You might have a point if they hadn't agreed to pitch-in in the first place.", "No, but I wouldn't be pissed when left off of the card.", "No, probably wouldn\u2019t cause I don\u2019t know them that well, but I also wouldn\u2019t have the audacity of getting mad about not being mentioned on the card", "It\u2019s a lot of money for a colleague and I probably wouldn\u2019t have contributed unless I was friends with the colleague. That being said, I wouldn\u2019t expect to have my name included in the card for the gift I didn\u2019t contribute to.", "I have a Britax stroller and it's money and it's less than half the cost of that stroller and it came with a car seat and base.", "You can find a stroller that does all those things listed for a quarter of that price. Like the poster below me, I had a Britax. I ended up giving it to my coworker after my son started Kindergarten. She still has it and he\u2019s now in 4th grade.", "A thank you card from a group (not individuals) would go back to the group.  It could either be handled as one card to the team, or individual cards to everyone, including those who didn't contribute.  The recipient doesn't need to know who didn't contribute... no need to single out folks who didn't contribute...  that's just tacky.  Everyone's financial situation is different.  To some people, $75 is not much, and to others, $75 is a lot.", "Yea, honestly a good idea they could have done that would have been cheaper was to second hand clothes for their later ages, like 2-4 and gave those. It would be cheaper than the $75 AND is also a great gift. Plenty of new mothers get given clothes for the 0-2 age but very rarely do they get it for the 2-4 ages.", "\"Platinum sponsor\": Petty Cash Drawer", "[deleted]", "My first show was The Vandals and Toy Dolls! We used to sneak into awesome shows back in the day. I remember seeing Bad Brains and having my mind blown!", "Why do they get a \"thank you\" when they didn't contribute?  That makes no sense.", "Probably because then they have to store then for 2+ years.", "> He didn't ask to receive the gift though\n\nThen he can politely decline the gift if he does not want to incur the social obligation of returning a gift in kind or facing the social stigma of being selfish. \n\n> This culture of giving extravagant gifts in your workplace is toxic\n\nNo, the weaponization of decency\u2014wherein people accept social benefits and then shun social obligations\u2014is toxic. Likewise, the contrarians who try to defend this misanthropy are toxic. No one is under an obligation to participate, but do not whinge when there are no future invitations to socialize.", "Ok, so you're a mooch. Lmao", "He put an expensive gift on his wedding registry, I'm assuming, so he absolutely expected to be gifted an expensive gift.", "I agree on the part that they shouldn\u2019t be obligated to buy anything for their co-workers but they can\u2019t get mad when they have consequences for that. You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too", "I missed my chance to see Bad Brains back then.  They played at the same place and my friends went, but I was grounded as usual haha", "Because they aren't really thoughtless.\n\nIt was my supervisors birthday, I got her a card and just a  nice chocolate bar. When my coworker realized I had done something he begged to add his name to the card. I felt a lil bad, but in the end i said he can get a card himself.", "That's just a random assumption you've made...", "Ahh the days of good shows\u2026 things aren\u2019t the same anymore. Boston, New York, and DC had some of the best music.", "And it's usually men trying to piggyback on women's labor...", "I hasn't thought of it that way. Thank you for clarifying!!", "I agree! But it's very common in the US to buy a gift off a wedding registry instead of something random. Most couples prefer you buy off their registry so they don't end up with 3 blenders.", "Yeah those days are long gone.  I'm lucky my 15 and 17 yo sons are into the same kinda stuff and we go to a few shows a year.  It just costs $150 a ticket now instead of $15", "I've left the discourse -as a Brit this whole thing just seems totally bananas to me. I can't wrap my head around in what world this is normal but then OPs username says it all.", "Haha I remember going to local hardcore shows in like church basements. They had to start shutting now some venues around Boston because of the fighting and issues with FSU members. A lot of places in the city wouldn\u2019t allow them to book there so they started playing out Boston in like Brockton (south of Boston)", "Buying a registry baby gift is bananas? Okay.", "I think you misunderstood me. That's not what I said. Where did the baby come from?"]}
