Don't enable that silliness.

It\u2019s starting to feel a bit weird and uneven. \n\nGive it another few years and you will be late 20s, potentially old enough to think about having children, and you will still be \u201cparenting\u201d this 18 year old boyfriend. \n\nIt would be ok to set a clear and calm boundary of \u201cnow I have lived on my own for a while, I would not consider moving in with a partner who hasn\u2019t also lived on their own (fully independent) for at least a year\u201d. \n\n(The \u201cfully independent\u201d means that it doesn\u2019t count if he moves out from his parents but someone else is paying some or all of his bills!)\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to mature and evolve and create new boundaries for yourself. \n\nRemembering that boundaries are only about your own behaviour and choices. Not about controlling other people. So the boundary is eg \u201cI choose to only move in with independent people\u201d (your behaviour). It cannot be \u201cmy boundary is that you need to get a full time job\u201d (this is about his behaviour). \n\nYou can share your healthy boundaries in a very low key, non-conflict way. They are just a fact of the universe, like gravity.

That will be sad, but it happens - that\u2019s the point of dating before marriage, to see if we grow together or our priorities and values diverge\u201d. \n\nCompatibility on priorities and values is massively important in a long term relationship. Things like do you want kids, whose family do you want to live near, do you want short term fun (luxury holidays and lifestyle) or early retirement - or somewhere in the middle, etc. \n\nOne of those values is level of independence - happy to rely on others as much as possible, never at all, or a happy balance somewhere in between. \n\nIt\u2019s an important one.", "NTA.

You shouldn't have to teach him anything or asking him to adult : he should take this path by himself, for himself.\nAnd if not for himself, well, for you should be a good reason too ! He's way older than you and you're more mature than him, that only should trick him into learning by himself things like budgeting and folding laundry. \n\nThe biggest mistake is to move in with a man who never lived by himself before. You want a man that is capable of managing himself, his laundry, his cleaning, his cooking, etc. Then you'll see about moving together and splitting chores.That is not the case currently and you shouldn't be his mother.", "My kids could cook simple meals, do laundry, make their own lunches, clean house etc. by the time they graduated high school.

His leaning in and really working towards basic and reasonable adult responsibility (or not) is going to tell you all you need to know. My advice is to be very clear about milestones of progress and the \u2018drop dead\u2019 date for certain things.  26 and living at home is a tough one for me, but it\u2019s not unheard of, to be sure. \n\nOne thing to consider\u2026does he have any credit at all?

He's never going to make ends meet working 20 hours a week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I told him since his name is not on the lease , and he hasn't moved in, I don't see why he should have a key. He then told me how it's normal for couples to do that. And if he had an apartment, he'd give me his key.\n\nAgain, he's not entirely wrong, *some* couples do this, but not all. I never had a key to my partner's place before we moved in together. And that's great that he'd give you a key to his non-existent apartment! He can get his own place now and give you a key. If you don't want to give him a key, that's all there is to it really. It's a key to your place, it's your decision.\n\nHonestly to me between the fact that he hasn't gotten serious and found employment that would theoretically pay his half of the rent and bills should you two move in together coupled with him minimizing your feelings about him having a key to your place are both huge red flags. I'm not gonna say you have to dump him now, but I have a feeling if you give him an ultimatum to shape up and get some financial stability before your lease is up, it'll just be kicking the can down the road. Maybe an ultimatum will get him to wake up, but it sounds an awful lot like he's going to expect you to just take care of him because, well, you earn so much more than he does and you've been doing okay paying all the bills anyway, so you might as well just keep paying all the rent and bills. Oh and you do the laundry so much better than he does, so you might as well keep doing that too...", "NTA but dump him. This guy won't be ever what you need your partner to be. Because he has clearly showed you he doesn't want to.", "He's going nowhere fast.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nNTA. if he doesn't want to give you the key back, change the locks. He's just looking for someone to take care of him, just like mommy and daddy.", "nta but you are dating a boy hoping for a man , that will not happen my as well move on find some one whos goals align with your goals", "NTA. Get your key. I have a feeling that when he objected, you just didn't get it back. He's more of a child than a man.", "If you let him move in, you're just going to take over the role of mummy.\n\nNTA", "NTA get yo key back y\u2019all not ready to live together", "NTA. Get that key back or switch out the locks before that hobosexual boyfriend of yours starts expecting you to do his laundry in addition to feeding him, cleaning up after him, and giving him a free place to stay. I doubt this relationship will survive it, but you'll be better off. Think of how nice it will be to fully enjoy the space you pay for. \n\nIf he insists he's ready to commit and act like an adult, great, he can do that over at his parents' house. When he can meet you as an equal, not a dependent, he can reach back out. Don't hold your breath, though.", "NTA. Also change your locks, there\u2019s nothing stopping him from making a copy of the key now that he knows you want it back.", "A lot of people making huge judgements based on a small description of this guy.\n\nImagine the tables were reversed and OP was a guy asking for his girlfriends keys back because she\u2019s not financially independent enough.\n\nSomething to think about.\n\nNTA btw. Your expectations are fine and it\u2019s good to tell him what they are. Tell him what you need him to do, give him a timeline of when realistically it should be done by and tell him you\u2019ll be proud of him when he accomplishes it. Rather than giving him an ultimatum and deadline.", "NTA", "NTA. You've asked once, don't ask again. Ask the landlord to change the locks. \n\nChange comes from a place of inspiration or desperation. It sounds like your boyfriend has neither. You say that he is learning from you \"how to adult\", yet he still hasn't gotten a full-time job or made plans of his own to move out of his parents house into his own apartment, not yours. I see a future of \"weaponized incompetence\" where you will forever be picking up the slack. If you let him move in with you, you will be enabling his behavior as much of his parents are.\n\nStop looking for project. You sound like you have your s*** together and you deserve to have a partner that pulls their own weight. Marriage or good long term partnerships are never 50/50. There will be time where one of you can't give as much as the other, and you need someone that YOU can count on pitching in the extra when you don't have it and vice versa. \n\nTo me, this sounds like it has been a starter boyfriend. Someone that might be fun, cute, but really not long-term material. This is one of those relationships that help you figure out what you don't want in a relationship long-term.", "Guys like this never change. Have your locks changed And give him the old heave ho.", "NTA. But wake up to the dude you\u2019re actually dating, not your fantasy about his \u201cpotential\u201d. He is currently a lazy mummy\u2019s boy looking to become a lazy your boy.", "So true. Also: \"It\u2019s only been a year, it can\u2019t happen over night\" what?! You've been together with for a a year but the dude is 26. He's had a lot more years to learn basic adult stuff.", "Very well stated", "Yep, not worth the time nor effort. Get your key and ciao!", "This! You better wake up girl.", "I would have the locks changed for your own safety. Even if he returns the keys, he may have made copies", "This.  Change the locks.", "And like, he apparently made it to 25 without any desire to adult independently from his parents\\*. Which is basically a deal-breaker in and of itself, IMO. Fine that OP missed it, she was *twenty* when they started dating. But she should listen to that dawning realization that he has no interest in pulling his own weight as an adult in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*absolutely no shade to adults living with their parents, shit is *hard* out there now and it really works for some families. But there is a version of that arrangement in which you financially and domestically contribute, and are an actual adult with some independence, who can meal plan and do laundry and contribute as an equal adult to a mixed-generation household. This...does not sound like that.", "Mom 2.0", "It\u2019s easy to change a lock. No need for a landlord. Just need a new barrel. \ud83d\udc4d", "Ah, one of my favorite truths to invoke on this sub - I have yet to find an exception: if you are considering getting a security camera to monitor your partner, pack it in. It's over. It's cheaper, more efficient, and maintains the moral high ground to just dump him now.", "I doubt he has a clue on how to get a key cloned.", "I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s illegal, you can\u2019t just change locks in a place you\u2019re renting, you need to inform the landlord about that.\n\nEdit: rather than illegal it would be more accurate to say that it would probably violate the lease agreement.", "Depends on the lease but it's true that many lease contract have clause about modification of the property which includes change of locks.  \n\n\nSo it might not be illegal but it can be breach of contract and even if it's not it's just polite to let landlord know that locks are being changed and for what reason.", "Just say you lost the key and give the landlord the spare. I\u2019ve done it in the past. Never been an issue. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
