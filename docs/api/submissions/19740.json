Oh and I'm using fake names which is something I've seen people do here? so that I can explain with more clarity..\n\nMy friend Emma (26F) and I (26F) have been friends since the first year of uni. We used to be closer but she is still a good friend.\n\nEmma and her fianc\u00e9 recently kept a small dinner at her place to start planning stuff for the wedding. Just a few family members and my husband, Jason and I.\n\nDinner was nice up until Emma started getting tipsy.\n\nThe thing about Emma is that she loves to drink. Even in Uni her thing was going to pubs or clubs and just having fun like that. I'm the total opposite and I hate drinking and clubbing. This never bothered me much because I don't have anything against what she does and why should I, its perfectly normal.\n\nThe problem comes when Emma disagrees with how I live.\n\nI got together with my husband quite young which Emma thinks is boring because I should have explored more, Emma thinks me not drinking is like a crime because she needs someone to drink with. Basically a lot of our convos consist of her trying to get me to be a party animal.\n\nTom didn't like it in the beginning that Emma used to get drunk at least twice a week or even smoke. He was about to end things because of this when they were only dating for a few months but then Emma swore that she'd only drink socially, quit smoking and the clubbing stuff and that she never liked doing that much anyways.\n\nThe truth is though, she still does drink. When we have our girls night she drinks a lot but gets home late enough so Tom won't understand. She smokes at work and when she tells him she's with me for dinner she's actually with her other friends at pubs.\n\nBut her habit of forcing me to try drinking and smoking was annoying me a lot recently, just because I feel like for a long time I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, but the amount she was doing that increased and I just felt so forced to be someone I'm not. I just didn't like that I had respect her lifestyle but she didn't respect mine.\n\nI'll admit, id already had a bad day so maybe I overreacted (why I think I'm the ah) but when she kept forcing me to drink over that day (despite me saying no especially when she literally held the glass to my mouth) I snapped, I told her that I don't want to end up an alcoholic like her sneaking drinks and lying to tom about doing so. I also told her something about being disrespectful. Tom was just stunned and just asked us to leave.\n\nThe next day Tom texted Jason saying Emma had told him everything and that he's taking a break from her. Emma and her friends texted me a lot blaming me and just insulting me.\n\nAt first I didn't feel like I did something wrong, especially with Jason supporting me, but since yesterday I have started doubting myself..idk I'm confused\n\n**tldr: friend was forcing me to drink, so I snapped and told her I don't want be an alcoholic like her who lies to her bf in front of said bf.**", "created_utc": 1686833305, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14a1kq4/aita_for_calling_my_friend_an_alcoholic_and/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Glad he dodged that bullet. Also, she constantly pushed for you to be like her sooner or later you were going to blow up. Honestly though you should\u2019ve stopped being her friend years ago. That\u2019s not a friend", "NTA.\n\nNormally, probably better not to say something like that.  But it seems like your friend was pushing you to the limits, so if you play with fire, you sometimes get burned.  Guess she got burned.\n\nIf she is getting drunk multiple times a week, that's a sign of alcoholism, and needs treatment.", "NTA.\n\nYou did Tom a huge favour. Being with an alcoholic is painful and will tear you down. This is coming from somebody with an alcoholic mother and who has been an alcoholic himself for some years (sober for 7 years now).\n\nThe thing with alcoholics is, that they seldomly agree on fighting against the adiction. They will rather keep on drinking in secret, just as your friend did. And you can't love an alcoholic sober. So often times, the only and best option you have is to leave as early as possible. Now Tom knows the truth and he can make his decision to leave her or tragically he will try to love her sober, which will like 99% fail.\n\nNow you face another trait of an alcoholic person: The sheer incapability to take responsibility. Alcoholics will always find a way to blame things on their surroundings, rather than their addiction. The person who fucked this whole situation up is your friend and her alcoholism. Not you. But your friend will do anything in her power to blame it on you and she will make her friends see you as the bad person, too. Because she simply cannot admit to herself that it is all of her own doing. Because that would mean that she had to admit that she's got an issue with alcohol. And alcoholics simply can't do that.\n\nAlso, alcoholism is not taken seriously enough, because it is so common and socially accepted to drink. That's why your friends maybe turn on you. But please don't think you did something wrong here. You did the right thing.", "ESH.  Emma is clearly an AH to lie to her fiance, expect you to cover her lies, as well as to try and force you to drink with her.\n\nYou were an AH **to Tom** for allowing Emma to use you as an excuse and hide her drinking for so long.\n\nTelling the truth is only an AH move if you have promised to keep a secret.  If you promised Emma you would never tell Tom about her drinking, then you're an AH for that as well.", "NTA. Holding a glass to your lips?? That's ridiculous. Girl has been a total ass and she finally pushed you too far.", "NTA, forced to drink, dump this so called friend.", "ESH \n\nNot a popular verdict I imagine. \n\nThere was a better way to approach the situation and I think you acknowledge that also. \n\n>I'll admit, id already had a bad day so maybe I overreacted \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand. Your friends actions aren't exactly angelic either. Their fianc\u00e9 or ex now I guess deserved to know the truth. Just maybe in a different way.", "I truly believe your NTA. Was it a low blow, most likely. Was the low blow made when you were having a bad day and sick of constantly being badgered. Yes. \n\nI'd have properly acted the same way. We can only be pushed so far before we crack.", "NTA she is an alcoholic", "NTA. You need stronger boundaries when it comes to your friendships, but I would be surprised if this situation didn't get rid of Emma for you.", "Lmfao this one is funny but a good one. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to say ESH \n\nEmma should not be forcing you to drink (gross behavior ewww we\u2019re adults no kids no one needs to peer pressure you to doing that) AND YOU MISS LADY should not have blurted out that she and alcoholic and a liar and lay out all her dirty laundry in front of her fianc\u00e9. You never get in between couples issues YOU always end up being the bad guy. \n\nSorry you emotions got the best of you. But I don\u2019t support either party", "Ooof, OP. What a messy mess. I\u2019m going with NTA. Even though your delivery wasn\u2019t the greatest, it needed to come out. Don\u2019t beat yourself up too much. Everyone has a breaking point and addicts have to come to terms with the harm that their addiction has caused their loved ones. Ultimately, it\u2019s probably best for Emma that her dirty little secret has been exposed.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd why do you call that AH your friend? SHe sure is not acting like a friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut: Neither are you", "I am a recovering addict/alcoholic. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for getting annoyed and snapping. I absolutely hate when people pressure others to use, even when I was using I never criticized anyone who didn\u2019t want to. \n\nBUT if you really care about this person and really believe she\u2019s an alcoholic and want her to get help, this probably didn\u2019t help her at all. She most likely pressures you because she\u2019s feeling guilty about her drinking. She hides it and lies to her boyfriend because she is incredibly ashamed and angry at herself for not being able to stop after promising she would (which she\u2019s probably done a thousand times). And you calling her out in front of Tom just feels like piling on the shame. People think being in active addiction is just partying all the time, but the truth is it fucking sucks. \n\nYou\u2019re entitled to your boundaries and this person has violated them repeatedly. It would be perfectly reasonable for you to decide to distance yourself. I probably would if I were you.\n\nIf you do want to continue having a relationship with this person and you are actually concerned about their drinking, not just annoyed, apologize for the reaction, explain that her pressuring you to drink is a hard boundary, and then tell her your reaction came from a place of concern. She\u2019ll probably blow you off, but it\u2019s an option.", "NTA, she needs to understand boundaries and not to lie to her partner. She doesn't need enabling, she has a problem and should seek professional help.", "ESH\n\nYour friend is an asshole for sure. \n\nYou are an asshole, not for revealing to Tom that she's an alcoholic and a liar since he deserves to know that, but for enabling her and letting it go on so long in the first place.", "NTA she can\u2019t be mad at you for something she did. She\u2019s the one lying to her boyfriend \nNvm forcing you to drink, I\u2019m so sorry you went through that", "ESH. Emma was being an ass, but using personal knowledge as a weapon when you're angry is always the wrong way to go about it. You said that to hurt her. Helping Tom was just a secondary effect.", "You exposed your \"friend\" as a serial liar to her fiancee, a liar about behavior which is unacceptable to him.   Moreover, your friend had co-opted you in her deception to her fiancee, by making you her alibi - which I'm assuming you've had to provide on more than one occasion.  So you've been lying to Tom, too (at a minimum, by omission, for not coming to him sooner with what was unacceptable behavior, to him, by your friend, and being her alibi for it).   \n\n\nSo ESH.  \n\n\nIf you truly wanted to just come clean, the way to do it wouldn't have been spur of the moment, when your friend was being a dick herself, trying to forcefeed you wine.  You would have sat down, had a serious talk with her, and convince her to come fully clean with Tom.    So it's pretty clear from your telling, that you did it to hurt her, to stop her from hurting you.  That's ESH behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
