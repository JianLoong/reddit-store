They will extend their overnight visits by many days without asking us. They show up with their dog even though our dog doesn\u2019t get along with her. They show up 6+ hours earlier than the scheduled time on Christmas. They ask to borrow money for something small (e.g. $50) and then \u201cforget\u201d to pay it back. And etc. - these are all examples, the exact thing is always different.\n\nAll of these things are theoretically kind of minor, but they bother me a lot. I feel that it's very inconsiderate, but it's also abundantly clear that they're not doing it on purpose - they were raised to think this is how everyone acts. Lately, I've been putting my foot down in nice ways. If they show up, I apologize and say we're not available but would love to hang out another day. If they invite their neighbors to Easter, I say that unfortunately, we won't be able to host that many people. \n\nMy husband is upset because he thinks I'm damaging the relationship. They do take all of these things kind of harshly and he says that things won't be the same if I continue. I'm very fed up from the past but also do feel a bit guilty, because I know they don't mean anything by it, yet I can't bring myself to let them overstep one more time. I DO want to be gracious and I want them to feel welcome but I do not like getting stepped on and it seems there is no middle ground. Now, I even presumptively set the boundary because I have a good idea of what they will do. He disagrees and says we need to meet in the middle and let it happen THEN respond once it gets bad enough.

They are all super rude by any reasonable standard, to the point of outright narcissism. If I were you, I'd start showing up to their house to make the point first. Kick in their door at 5 am, demand they make you some eggs, and then blast baby shark on their TV. When they complain, say \"this is how you behave every goddamn time. It stops now.\" And then never let them in your house again without an invite.\n\nNTA", "None of those things are minor, and in aggregate it's extremely major boundary stomping.\n\nAll you are doing is setting and enforcing clear boundaries, something which is psychologically healthy. What's worrisome is that your husband wants to undermine this healthy practice and enable his parent's boundary stomping to \"keep the peace\". He clearly has spent a lifetime appeasing his abusive parents and does not know how to stop.\n\nThis kind of thing will destroy marriages eventually. It's imperative you get him into couples counseling so he can start to learn how unhealthy his relationship with his parents is.\n\nIn the meantime, continue to set clear boundaries, even if it upsets your husband. \n\nNTA.", "Very much NTA. But your husband gets included with his family in very much TA side of things.\n\nMy cousin\u2019s marriage broke up because of my aunt. Her (and my uncle\u2019s) gift to them upon their marriage was a plot of land to build their house\u2026which happened to be at the top of the property my grandparents had owned for years. It also happened to be up the hill from my aunt\u2019s house. I bet you can tell where this is going.\n\nShe\u2019d show up constantly. She was given a key for emergencies but she\u2019d use it to let herself in whenever tf she wanted to. She\u2019s overbearing and irritating in general so I can\u2019t imagine how much worse it was for them.  She always had a good reason for it.  Eventually my cousin and his wife started fighting because my cousin wouldn\u2019t put his foot down. Then he did try to set boundaries to help his marriage. That pissed off my aunt so it started all over again. Marriage didn\u2019t last (got really crazy tbh but that\u2019s neither here nor there unless you want to hear some drama.)\n\nThey are the problem. Your husband is also the problem for not supporting you. It\u2019s not his house it\u2019s a shared house. Just because it\u2019s how they were raised doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t learn something new or change their behaviors. If they like him and at least tolerate you they should be able to understand that their actions are causing harm to people they care for.", "NTA. they are adults and no means no. it's not a wild concept that people have boundaries, they should be able to accept that and your husband should support you.", "NTA - setting boundaries AHEAD of time is the best way to deal with these issues. Husband's family needs to understand and respect your time and efforts. Set commonsense boundaries and compromise on those that make sense.", "NTA\n\nThey can\u2019t just show up and take over the house.", "OMG. No, you're NTA. \n\nYour husband needs to stop worrying about their feelings and respect yours as well.\n\nSetting boundaries ahead of time is ideal. They clearly don't understand and need to be told, so you're doing them a kindness by letting them know before it gets awkward or they cross a line. \n\nHe should be telling them the boundaries as well so it's not just you being the \"bad guy\".\n\nKeeping the peace and maintaining the relationship shouldn't fall all on you or require only you to be uncomfortable. They need to learn boundaries and the relationship can continue in a way that respects you, your home and marriage and that doesn't drive you absolutely insane", "NTA.  And I've read through your comments - stop saying that they just don't know any better.  They do know better, they just don't care/don't think you and your husband will fight back.  Not only would I bet money that they don't act that way in professional or non-family member settings, but you've already told them the behavior is not acceptable.  If they keep acting in a way that they know (and yes, THEY KNOW) is unacceptable, then it's them ruining the relationship.", "NTA \n\nThey\u2019re rude and I\u2019d find their behaviour intolerable too. I don\u2019t blame you for setting boundaries.", "NTA - I can't even imagine showing up unannounced let alone bringing a stranger to someone else's house.  Everyone is raised differently but it sounds like you explicitly have told them this isn't okay for you.  You can just delete that line about \"oversteps boundaries in our home without meaning to \" right now.  They are knowingly overstepping now and continue to do so.  Your husband sucks and because it sounds like you are telling him that it has gotten bad enough but he is ignoring you to please his parents.", "NTA but your husband is, he should be setting these boundaries with them to help his wife's mental health.", "NTA.. Your husband's family has zero etiquette and needs to be aware that just because they don't, doesn't mean you don't either. I'd be pretty pissed about their bs too.", "NTA but I think a couples counselor would be really beneficial. You two need to get on the same page about things. It will probably require sacrifice and compromise from both parties. \n\nBut no, you do not need to wait until your boundary is stomped before you take action. His whole \u201cdon\u2019t say anything until it gets bad\u201d is nonsense. And it\u2019s really unhealthy. \n\nBeing proactive and preventative is crucial in situations like these.", "NTA. They obviously don't respect you or your marriage.", "NTA. Your home, your rules. Frankly what they do, overstepping boundaries like that, is something most people wouldn\u2019t appreciate and it\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019re that unaware and self-absorbed to not know it\u2019s extremely rude to impose on other people like that. You\u2019re right to set boundaries, but your husband also needs to step up and have a talk with them about this. It will be better coming from him than from you, that way you don\u2019t risk \u201cdamaging the relationship\u201d, although to be honest it\u2019s them the ones who are damaging it.", "NTA for setting reasonable boundaries. Being told to show up at a certain time and then arriving six hours early doesn't seem reasonable. Nor does bringing additional uninvited people to a holiday party.", "NTA. It's always better to be proactive instead of reactive! Going about it the way your husband wants you to means his family will get away with whatever they want and deal with the consequences later.. or lack of consequences in this case considering your hubby.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you have a husband problem as well as a rude inlaw problem.", "NTA. I think your plan makes sense. I think it's better that you teach people how to treat you up front rather than letting them walk all over you and get punished for it afterwards.", "I'll say NTA while picking my bottom jaw up off the table. Who TF acts like that???? I'm more concerned that your husband doesn't see any of this an issue and doesn't have your back.", "NTA. Why are you always hosting? \n\nI say if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Buy a crate for their dog and make them use it. Tell them they're welcome to order food, and you'll have x, y, and z, thanks! Grab the remote and turn the channel back and say we're watching that, we can watch your show when this one is over. If they show up early, put them to work. Have a separate \"kids table\" for them to sit at if they invite orphans (the inviters, not the orphans).\n\nDon't treat them like guests, treat them like the children they behave as.", "NTA. \"Let it happen and then respond when it gets bad enough\"? Yo. That's what you're doing. It got bad enough for you and you responded. His requirement was met. He just doesn't like it.", "NTA! Does he not care that he\u2019s damaging YOUR relationship? Your problem is him, by the way. No loving husband throws his wife to the curb to protect his \u201cfamily\u201d. This is not minor, and I would seriously reconsider this marriage.", "NTA You are well within your rights to set boundaries in your own home. And it is your and your husband's home, but his family's. They don't live there, but they certainly seem to act like they do. \n\n>He disagrees and says we need to meet in the middle and let it happen THEN respond once it gets bad enough.\n\nSounds like it's happened enough times that you feel it warrants a response. Your husband may be okay with having his family walk all over his home and boundaries, but he really should have your back on this.", "Nta. Your husband needs to step up here.
