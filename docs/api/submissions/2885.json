Anyone who would get upset about requests like \"please don't bring neighbors over without asking us first\" and \"you can't stay over longer than we initially agreed upon\" isn't being reasonable or kind, and I suspect, in that case, that the issue isn't those people not realizing they're doing anything wrong.", "Oh... that's bad. He's putting their whims over his livelihood? And they let him. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nYeah, this is a good enough reason for counselling on its own. Couples, individual, all of it. Sounds like he's in desperate need of a reality check.", "I see these people \u201ceveryone is calling and text boning me that my reasonable boundary is ridiculous!\u201d\n\nSiML: block the b*tches. Why is this hard. Just block them and get on with your life.", "I wish mine were boring in any way. I\u2019d love some peace.", "\"he decided to cheat back\" \n\nJfc I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Most grown adult people are still way too immature for marriage and y'all may downvote away if you like but I stand by it.", "I did start doing that more recently! Unfortunately once one thing is taken care of it seems like another one pops up. And many of the things that they just happen to do in my house are things I can\u2019t foresee. But the ones I can deal with (like making a little area in my house to work) I definitely do my best to take care of for next time", "This is exactly what happened. I was frantically cleaning and getting ready and was not happy!", "NTA.. Your husband's family has zero etiquette and needs to be aware that just because they don't,", "I couldn\u2019t agree more. It doesn\u2019t even have to be that they themselves are immature. If they can\u2019t choose a good partner because of their history/trauma (looking at myself here) that\u2019s a problem, too. There are so many problems most of us need to address before we can be in a functional, healthy relationship. Often we learn the hard way. Sadly some people never learn.", "But is there a pattern that each issue only inconveniences you and not your husband? Not that it doesn't bother him, but the expectation and labor fall to you.\n\nI ask because I always thought my extended family could not control themselves, and life was just messy for them and those around them. But, one day, I realized all these 'unforseeable events' only affect certain people. They could make plans and show up on time, but only for people they value.\n\nIt might be worth a test to see if their behavior changes if they know your husband will exclusively be the one in charge of their needs. But, I think you are right to do away with the awful behavior altogether. NTA"]}
