We agreed that I pay part of the electricity, gas and water bills and help her out with the girls (7 and 10), everything was going great for a while as I kept up my word and took the girls to school and back, helped them with homework and helped Ellie with household chores on top of having my normal 8am-5pm workday hours.\n\nEllie and I have always been close and especially after my divorce with Ryan, we don\u2019t have any other family besides each other, her husband and the girls so we always stick close. Steve and I on the other hand never got along well so he was really hostile towards me ever since I moved in.

You are a third wheel, forcing this man to put up with someone he doesn\u2019t like in his private space.

Six months is a long time to have someone you don\u2019t really get along with in your home.  Doesn\u2019t sound like you plan to move out for years.

Sure, rely on family, that's what they're there for, but no ETA or goals for leaving?

No matter how lovely a guest is, staying for longer periods of time with a married couple, they end up creating a bit of a wedge between the couple. For instance, I love my MIL, she's a lovely person. She visits us for a month every year. And she drives me absolutely nuts by the end of her visits. I barely get any alone time with my wife, even the tiniest disagreement with my wife suddenly becomes a 2v1 situation, I don't feel heard most of the time (as MIL blames her tinnitus for not hearing something, but never asks anyone to repeat anything & just assumes what they said, which 99% of the time is NOT what they said). \n\nNow imagine my situation if it were someone I didn't like all that much. And they stayed for half a year. And don't seem to be going anywhere any time soon. See how Steve might not be your biggest fan at the moment? \n\nYes, they need to work things out, yes he needs to do more around the house and spend more time with his daughters. But guess what? He can't do any of that with you there, always taking sides against him if anything happens. So go sleep on some friends couch until you find a place of your own.

It is a big stress on their marriage.  Be the bigger person and work on your plan to move out.  It doesn\u2019t need to be tomorrow, but come up with a timing and plan.  You need roommates and a 2nd job.  You will have a lot of time on your hands since you are not doing all the housework and childcare.  Throw your extra money at the loan and get this paid off.

The deal was to help pay bills, but mainly help the sister with chores and childcare.  So Steve expecting OP to move out within a week? Not realistic. Which brings me to 2.\n\n2. Steve made a unilateral decision to kick OP without first discussing it with his wife.  That convo should have between the 2 of them and a deadline / move out date agreed upon, before Steve sprung it on OP and his wife.  Yes, OP's been there 6 months, but if no end date was discussed and her financial troubles understood, I can see how this caught OP off guard.\n\n3.  It is clear that OP's sister appreciates the help and childcare support that OP is providing - so I can see OP's dilemma. Her sister wants her  to stay and continue helping vs Steve the guy who does nothing.  Which is why, this conversation should have remained between Steve and the sister.\n\n4.  OP further explained she planned on moving out in the next couple of months, but def by Christmas - so there was a loose time line in place.\n\nAll that said, OP, while I still say NTA, unfortunately Steve has made his position clear and it is now impacting the marriage.

Of course husband is pissy about it because most people don't want a house guest for 6+ months, but OP never said sister mentioned her leaving and the babysitting and cleaning OP does helps out sister...who again, asked her to come help with the kids! \n\nBasically, sister was carrying the whole marriage before OP moved in.

It completely changes the WHOLE family dynamics they had set-up and it can 100% cause angst between couples. But your sister wanted to lend a hand and help you, it's what family does. \n\nCould you have a really open honest heart to heart to steve, and perhaps try and give them some more couple time, or leave the house on some weekend nights or something just so he feels like he can spend some time in his home with your sister?", "Was steve a shit dad before you moved in or is he not helping because that was the deal when you moved in, so he doesn't have to while your living there?", "Yikes", "You're a fully grown adult. You should be able to get yourself together and put a roof over your own head, especially since you're causing issues in their marriage. YTA.", "You are a guest in their home.  Why do you think you get to decide how long you get to stay?  Steve wants you to move out pronto.... guess what?  It's his house and he has a right to tell you to move out.  It has been going on for a couple of weeks.... and have you done a single thing during that time to make plans to move out? \n\nYour life is your responsibility. Grow up, get out, and get a life!", "You've already overstayed your welcome! It's been HALF A YEAR ffs", "You just said in another comment you couldn\u2019t imagine leaving your sister alone. You do not care about the harm you are causing.", "So are you hoping to cause a divorce so you can move back in", "INFO: What was the initial plan? Was there any timeline discussed? How much of the debt have you paid off in 6 months? Have you been working a job, and how many hours?", "I thought the same! Misery seems to be looking for company", "Maybe, but this sure isn't helping and we really don't have enough info on what the family dynamic was like before.", "Even before she moved in the children were there. How do we know how they took care of the household?\n\n\n Sister should stop considering OP as her 'little sister'. She ain't little anymore.\n\n\n And honestly this reason seems like OP is simply trying to justify her stay.", "Or maybe he doesn't have room to do for his family because somebody else has muscled their way in and pushed him out. No indication of what he was like before the interloper.", "Upset, sure. \n\nTo use the words OP gave us, ruining his marriage? Kinda odd thing to say. It suggests that his problem isn't the fact there's a great that doesn't leave, but that his wife and kids are so close to her.", "Guess whose house it also is? Ellie's. And she wants OP to stay. So Steve doesn't get the final say here and OP is right. Moving out isn't an instant thing like how Steve wants.", "[deleted]", "I did say I work 8am-5pm, paid off around 10k as I was able to sold my stuff to make it faster. There was no set term - ellie said until i get up enough to not live on the street or with complete strangers - her only condition was to help her with the kids as steve does bare minimum to look after them and my sister clearly needs help as she has a job and can\u2019t be a stay in mom. Steve\u2019s condition was for me to pay the bills (some ppl pulled up with me not paying the rent or house being Steve\u2019s - the house is theirs, it\u2019s paid off so all they pay is bills and YES the house is Ellie\u2019s as much as steve\u2019s) which i do ON TOP OF buying food for the WHOLE family, not myself only and other necessities. Steve didn\u2019t like me before their marriage and I thought that was made clear when i said we never got along. I don\u2019t get in their private life, me and ellie do spend a lot of time together - but it\u2019s not 24/7 and i even take the girls out so they can have solo dates without the girls running around. So I\u2019m basically doing free babysitting wherever and whenever.", "Agreed maybe Steve used to do chores and things with his family but since op moved in she forced her way into that position", "I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he is \u201cStriking\u201d due to OP being there.", "Or he may feel ganged up on his own house. She clearly doesn\u2019t respect him.", "I don\u2019t think so. It sounds like OP is incredibly needy and what likely is occurring is that her sister is spending so much time looking after OP that her husband takes the backseat.", "Actually I disagree if you are living with someone they do get a veto before adding another person.", "Actually he does get the final say. When it comes to someone else staying in a shared space BOTH PEOPLE NEED TO AGREE.", "All that was said was that Ellie stood up for the OP.  That doesn't necessarily mean she wants OP to stay,  especially if it is going to cost her her marriage. Sounds more like OP trying to justify her actions.  \n\nIf OP gave a shit about her sister and her nieces, she would never have put her sister in this position and she certainly would not continue to stay", "You shouldn't be able to let guests camp out for months on end if everyone who lives there isn't on board. Ellie is TAH too for letting OP impose. \n\n\nIf this was a man letting his mess of an overbearing mother stay, even though it was driving his wife crazy, everyone would be saying he needs to kick you TF out", "The problem is that her sister is married. That means she can't just make a decision on another human being living with them indefinitely.", "Well that seems to be what the OP would like to believe,  but even she didn't say that.... just that her sister stood up for her.   Really sounds like the OP is trying to justify her actions in staying", "And she's received 6 months of getting to have an unwanted guest live in the house. That's plenty of time.", "You need to move out ASAP.  Your sister and her husband need to work on their marriage.  You being there is not helping in the long run.  Babysitting and doing a few chores is not the help they need.  Move out and get your own life.  Let them live theirs.", "Ah you're one of those. Sure bud.", "This is a two yes required situation. If someone who owns a home does not want a guest staying there, then sorry, guest needs to go.", "But if Ellie stood up for her sister - that's sort of an indication that she doesn't want her to go. Otherwise she'd be siding with the husband and saying yeah get out.\n\nI agree that OP should get out of there but more do for herself since the husband is the one making it a hostile place to live. OP isn't ruining their marriage- she's earning her keep. It more so sounds like the husband sees the work that OP is doing that HE should be doing and getting pissy.", "I agree? That's why I'm saying the sister is the AH.", "I get what you're saying but if the agreement was for her to move in and help out, while getting out from a bunch of debt - the problem is what defines that?  It clearly meant 1 thing to Steve and a completely different thing to OP and the sister.  This is why setting clear expectations and a timeframe are important.  Had the deal included her staying for 6 months max, then yes OP would the AH.  Being allowed to stay until you get back on your feet is open to interpretation.  If OP's sister is telling OP how great it is she's there and how helpful she's been with childcare, I can see how OP didn't feel pressed to find other accommodations. Until Steve had his freak out, she didn't know his unspoken deadline was 6 months.  Now she does but 1 week isn't feasible.  30 days, should be.", "Not a man. I don\u2019t think anyone (man or woman) would want to live with an inlaw and the only time it would be okay if if person couldn\u2019t take cafe of themselves. Six months if it no plans to move out", "Ellie stood up for her sister but it doesn\u2019t mean OP should put her in the middle like she should.\n\nIt makes 100 percent sense that Steve wouldn\u2019t want her there.\n\nAnd you know want sister made vows to Steve.", "The sister and BIL need to have a serious discussion, sure. OP is still an AH, but it seems like her sister is allowing her to believe she can stay indefinitely.", "Or Steve has been ignored for 6 months while OP paid zero attention to what her living there did to the family and he just snapped off after she failed to get any \"hints\". Considering now she still doesn't get it, I don't think she was very receptive to hints at all. Just calls him a crappy Dad while living is his home for essentially free. It's just an easy way to ruin sister's marriage", "No one would want to live with an inlaw, yes. And in those circumstances I'd certainly be trying to aim for a certain  ETA.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is sometimes people don't have a choice, especially when you have large debts. And when you marry someone, your partners family issues become something that you become involved in.\n\nYou talk to your partner about helping her sister out, not set up a situation where your partner is forced to choose between her husband and her sister. And she chose her sister.\n\nThat is not disrespect.  That's the consequences of his own actions \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Sister did make vows to Steve but it sounds like Steve does a whole lot of nothing while OP has been keeping her end of the deal. She isn't mooching. She's working, taking care of the kids, etc. Things STEVE should be doing.\n\nTaking vows doesn't mean Ellie has to defend Steve to the end. Especially when he's wrong and trying to kick out what sounds like the only help Ellie has.\n\nObviously we are all speculating because we just have OP's side but based on the initial post I say NTA. Steve isn't pulling his weight as husband and father. Ellie gets help and not everything on her shoulders with OP there. OP isn't getting in the middle of their marriage. She's not gossiping about Steve and telling Ellie to leave him. She's working and doing the things Steve should be doing but can't be arsed to do.", "Then the issue is the sister.  He's a grown man, he should've told his wife OP needed to go.  As for the crappy Dad, there's a reason sister needed help with chores and childcare and that's why they allowed her to move in.  I'm not saying Steve is wrong, I'm saying it's not OP's fault her sister is communicating one thing, while Steve said nothing until he hit his breaking point.", "How do you know that he hasn\u2019t talked to his partner this is going on six months.\n\nIf you read OPs comments I don\u2019t think she ever planned on leaving. She even gives excuses why she shouldn\u2019t I help with house etc.\n\nI think he probably yelled at op out of desperation", "If Steve works and provides a roof over people\u2019s head that\u2019s not nothing.\n\nIf Ellie wants more help around the house she can negotiate with Steve more help like a cleaning lady. Someone who doesn\u2019t live with them\n\nWe only have OPs version if Ellie is a stay at home mom she should be doing more work around the house.\n\nAnd it maybe OP coming there was under protest and Steve feels she is hear I don\u2019t want her head she better do the housework.\n\nThere are  a ton of ways Ellie can get help without her sister there.\n\nOne adult who pays at least partially for where they live feels OP is mooching", "Based on the initial post I would assume that the op is an unreliable narrator.", "I'd be willing to be a shiney nickel that Steve's had this conversation with the wife, who ignored him because \"she's family\". Though I think you're correct that he should have done better than just getting pissed off and yelling.", "If he's been talking to his partner and she's ignoring him,  well then she's an AH. Or thats theres seriously something rotten in their rlship. But his wife is his greatest obstacle, not OP.\n\nMy vote was E S H for a reason. No one is behaving particularly well here.", "Oh undoubtly! Which is why I'm saying the sister is the AH, not OP.  That said, now that OP knows, she needs to get gone or she would be the AH.", "I don\u2019t necessarily know if wife is the biggest obstacle. It\u2019s not like Ellie was begging op to live with her when OP is doing good.\n\nEllie may be very concerned about OP\u2019s financial situation"]}
