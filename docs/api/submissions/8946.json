She should've literally got a grip and held onto her phone, or had a better case even. You didn't intentionally try to damage her phone. She repeatedly disrespected you and didn't listen to a very simple request. \n\nPlus, if you and your partner didn't want the video, and she wasn't going to post it anywhere, what is the point of her keeping it anyway? Is she gonna sit by herself and watch it every now and then? She had no reason to not delete the video other than spite. \n\nBeyond all of that, she dropped her own phone, you didn't do anything to it.", "NTA\n\nConsequences. She got some thrown her way.", "NTA, you AND your boyfriend said no. Her failure to listen is her own problem.", "NTA - you asked her more than once to not video you", "NTA. Now you have also learned that she is not to be trusted in public places and around others. She is embarrassing and may not always have your back. This whole episode was an indicator of future behavior. Good luck to you.", "NTA\n\nYou told your selfish AH of a sister who doesn't understand boundaries not to video your meeting with your bf. It doesn't matter even in the slightest that it's \"a cute video\" - it's a video you didn't want. If it was \"nothing\", then there wouldn't be a problem for her not to do it, would there?", "NTA for reasons different than some of the other commentators. \n\nYour sister was violating your privacy by doing the one thing you told her not to do. That makes her an asshole, full stop. You dumped a bottle of water on her. That probably wasn't very nice, but it got her to stop filming the video, which was your goal. Now, here's why you're not the asshole: you have no duty to guard against the tragically bizarre. Who anticipates that someone is going to drop their phone because of a little water? (No one.) Your sister should have held on to her device. It's her own fault that she dropped it and cracked her screen.", "NTA. Play a song from a Disney soundtrack out loud next time she does that....", "NTA - This would not have happened if she had respected your privacy in the first place.", "NTA. \n\nYou have a right to privacy, and you should be able to trust your sister. She broke your trust, and ruined what should have been a nice reunion for you. You may have *slightly* over-reacted (I personally would have gone with telling her off and then decreasing contact for a bit), but you didn\u2019t slap the phone out of her hand, you threw a bit of water, which might ruin the video, but isn\u2019t likely to ruin a modern phone. Actions have consequences. Your sister needs to grow up.", "NTA.\n\nShe did this to herself.\n\nBut in future don't shake water at people, and also just don't trust your sister.", "ESH - Shaking water didn't drop the phone, she did. Similarly, taking video didn't spread water, you did.\n\nBoth of you are assholes because both of you refuse to take responsibility for what you did.\n\nShe dropped the phone.

Your sister was wrong every step of the way on this one and you absolutely should not pay her for the phone screen - especially since you didn't break her phone, she did. Also, you really, really need to be firm about how messed up it was that despite explicitly telling her no she continued to film you without your consent. That's messed up and if I believed in karma I'd say that's what broke her phone screen.", "NTA.
