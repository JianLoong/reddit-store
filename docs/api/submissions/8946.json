She should've literally got a grip and held onto her phone, or had a better case even. You didn't intentionally try to damage her phone. She repeatedly disrespected you and didn't listen to a very simple request. \n\nPlus, if you and your partner didn't want the video, and she wasn't going to post it anywhere, what is the point of her keeping it anyway? Is she gonna sit by herself and watch it every now and then? She had no reason to not delete the video other than spite. \n\nBeyond all of that, she dropped her own phone, you didn't do anything to it.", "NTA\n\nConsequences. She got some thrown her way.", "NTA, you AND your boyfriend said no. Her failure to listen is her own problem.", "NTA - you asked her more than once to not video you", "NTA. Now you have also learned that she is not to be trusted in public places and around others. She is embarrassing and may not always have your back. This whole episode was an indicator of future behavior. Good luck to you.", "NTA\n\nYou told your selfish AH of a sister who doesn't understand boundaries not to video your meeting with your bf. It doesn't matter even in the slightest that it's \"a cute video\" - it's a video you didn't want. If it was \"nothing\", then there wouldn't be a problem for her not to do it, would there?", "NTA for reasons different than some of the other commentators. \n\nYour sister was violating your privacy by doing the one thing you told her not to do. That makes her an asshole, full stop. You dumped a bottle of water on her. That probably wasn't very nice, but it got her to stop filming the video, which was your goal. Now, here's why you're not the asshole: you have no duty to guard against the tragically bizarre. Who anticipates that someone is going to drop their phone because of a little water? (No one.) Your sister should have held on to her device. It's her own fault that she dropped it and cracked her screen.", "NTA.

She broke your trust, and ruined what should have been a nice reunion for you. You may have *slightly* over-reacted (I personally would have gone with telling her off and then decreasing contact for a bit), but you didn\u2019t slap the phone out of her hand, you threw a bit of water, which might ruin the video, but isn\u2019t likely to ruin a modern phone. Actions have consequences. Your sister needs to grow up.", "NTA.\n\nShe did this to herself.\n\nBut in future don't shake water at people, and also just don't trust your sister.", "ESH - Shaking water didn't drop the phone, she did. Similarly, taking video didn't spread water, you did.\n\nBoth of you are assholes because both of you refuse to take responsibility for what you did.\n\nShe dropped the phone.

Your sister was wrong every step of the way on this one and you absolutely should not pay her for the phone screen - especially since you didn't break her phone, she did. Also, you really, really need to be firm about how messed up it was that despite explicitly telling her no she continued to film you without your consent. That's messed up and if I believed in karma I'd say that's what broke her phone screen.", "NTA. She did that to herself.", "It\u2019s super sweet for your sister to make this moment all about her.", "NTA. you could\u2019ve taken your sister\u2019s phone and deliberately broke it and i still wouldn\u2019t consider you TA.", "NTA your sister totally dismissed very clear orders not to video. She dismissed it in order to exploit you for her own social media. \n\nI have dropped friends and bf's too because of blatantly ignoring my no! To get their own way at my expense. I even dropped a cousin who ignored my husband and I literally shouting No! at our wedding, but she dismissed us and got hurt in the process, which of course she blamed on us!\n\n Obviously this is your sister, not just some friend so she is going to be harder to deal with. But you need to tell her she needs to start prioritizing real relationships over social media.", "op=NTA\n\nshe dropped her own darn phone and was taking video of you without your permission--EXPLICITLY Stated.", "NTA.

Don't film other without their permission.\n\n\nMy close friend was filming someone in public because he said he looked like a doppelganger of his other friend. Guy was not happy about it and actually took my friends phone and threw it on the road. It got smashed by an oncoming car, and we both stood there like what tf just happened. Don't film people.", "NTA.\n\nI can't believe the crooked arrogance of your sister. You made it emphatic that you didn't want her photographing you, she came up with the usual \"I'm going to do it anyway\" bullshit reasons, you held to your boundary, and she reluctantly agreed not to camera you.\n\nThen, with your back turned, she goes right ahead and cheats you.\n\nShe's the AH.", "Nta but you do have some responsibility towards her phone regrettably simply because your intentional actions caused her to drop it. Should she have listened, yes, were you an AH, no. But regardless after that you did cause her to drop her phone, feel bad for you.", "I\u2019d have grabbed it from her hand, deleted the video and her TikTok account, thrown it against a wall and personally smashed it into irrecoverable smithereens for good measure, so no, NTA.", "ESH", "<*don't shake water at people*\\>>\n\nUnless the sister is Oz's Witch of the West, Water should NOT be a problem.", "NTA she dropped it, you didn't knock it from her hand", "NTA.", "NTA.

Even ignoring the fact that she was being a little shit, it's not like what you did directly caused her phone to crack. She just got clumsy.", "NTA. Cracking her screen does not get rid of the video though.  Make sure to con her into handing over the phone so you can \"examine the damage\" and then delete it yourself.", "You less than her though. She shouldn't have filmed you, but you still broke her property. You can't really get around that fact. Her property is damaged because of you. \n\nIf it came down to legalities, you have no expectation of privacy in public and you caused what could be classed as criminal damage.\n\nETA: everything above was from me being a ham at reading.

New verdict: NTA", "And obvious she only wanted to go to the airport to make the video.

Will change it now", "You have 2 options that are reasonable. 1. Don't pay for the broken phone and let it go. 2. Pay for the phone and Sue your sister. You break it you pay, so if we are going with responsibilities and legalities, she should pay compensation for taking a non authorised video", "As someone with a sister that pulls stunts like this, I say you\u2019re absolutely NTA.

DAMN. Like, they just met in person for the first time EVER and it was completely ruined for everyone. And after that, I don't know if I'd want to be nice to my sister for a long time. What a dumb, avoidable mess.", "Yeah..I hate to say it but YTA.\n\nI knew a couple girls in high school that did this.\n\nOne of the girls parents sued over the phone.\n\n In their case the phone was smashed when it fell from their hands two stories to the quad below.\n\nIn the eyes of the law in the US you can not physically attack people or destroy their property. Done..end of story...keep your hands and squirt bottles to yourself.\n\nParents won the lawsuit and the other girl's parents had to pay for a new phone and the court case legal fees.\n\n Look it how celebrities have to handle poperazzi that chase them for pictures and video. Then if the celebrity gets angry and breaks a camera the news is quickly hushed. Probably because the photographer got paid.\n\nProblem here is OP has no right to say no to the video being taken...it only becomes a matter of rights if the said video is sold or published in some way.\n\nOP I really hope you two can talk it out. Good luck.", "Not to mention that OP and her boyfriend couldn't even enjoy their reunion without the intrusion of having to deal with the sister's awful and selfish behavior. \n\nThe cracked phone screen sounds like karma to me.", "ESH. Her obviously for recording. You for escalating and throwing water. This is one of those situations where you just walk away", "NTA sounds like real life consequences to me!

People use spray bottles on pets to train them, and it sounds like your sister needs to be trained to respect people's autonomy, privacy, and right to not have their life plastered on social media \n\nYou of course realise that the video is the whole reason she wanted to go to the airport, right? I'd be hesitant about letting her tag along on any other outings.", "NTA\u2026 karmas a bitch and she\u2019s a fast one", "Same! For some reason I misread and thought she was 11!", "It's a distinction without a difference.", "No it's not. If you dump a bottle of water on someone, they become physically wet, which is pretty uncomfortable and would likely cause a physical reaction like jumping, could cause damage to electronics they're wearing, etc. Shaking a bottle of water at someone just makes a sloshing noise (assuming it's closed; why would it be open if she were in the process of hugging someone? And even if it was, this would just be a couple drops of water, not a full drench)."]}
