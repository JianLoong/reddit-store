Toxoplasmosis, which lives in cat poop, is pretty much only a risk for healthy people if it is contracted while a woman is pregnant.

Unfortunately the cat will need to be rehomed, and you should stand firm in your boundaries with that one \"The cat goes, or I go\". It was incredibly disrespectful of her to do that.\n\nAlso, you're still allowed your own time. As is she. It will be important when baby comes that you two still make time for yourselves and for eachother. Baby is important, but you have to take care of yourselves and your relationship too.

Maybe hire a maid once a week and come to some agreement where she can do light house cleaning in between. The cat situation is puzzling, as normally cats aren't super friendly towards infants pulling on their fur etc. I understand the need for her to have a companion but to pick one that you would be allergic to is a head scratcher. Why not get an allergy friendly dog? (Not a puppy) If she's not doing the bare minimum to care for herself, her surroundings, you or her pet then there might be some mental issues at play. Seems like some therapy might be helpful in conjunction with regular Dr. visits. There's a big schism in communication and expectations here.", "INFO. OP it sounds like your wife is literally doing nothing but eating and sleeping. If this is the case then you are NTA.

If this is all the case, step up and take assert yourself in the relationship. Do not \"ask\" her if you can have some down time (seeing friends, going out by yourself) just tell her in advance when you are going so she is aware. Stop doing EVERYTHING and delegate some of the tasks to her. Being pregnant can be difficult at times but if your post is accurate and she has not been diagnosed as high risk and put on mandated bedrest, she needs to continue to be active for her own health, and contribute to the household for the sake of her family - all 3 of you.

Her body is changing quickly and she probably feels fat, ugly, scared, stupid plus a million other emotions. Does any of it make sense ? absolutely not.

I didn\u2019t want to deal with a crazy mental breakdown from her side or her screaming and yelling at me. I just wanted her to be happy and if she needed it for her pregnancy, then she needed it. Whether it was an emotional support, animal or what. But I am giving the cat to a no kill shelter.", "I\u2019m really sorry about your situation. \nThe thing is, being pregnant will get you super emotional and sensitive, and you get tired, but not to the point of not being able to do anything, if she is not working there is not rush for her to finish a full house cleaning in a day, she could take her time, as you have said, she is not high risk, there is not  excuse for not wanting to do anything, imagine when the baby comes, you are not going to have a free moment. \nPlease, don\u2019t lie to yourself and think if she has been like this before, disregarding your wants and putting hers first, she quit her job without discussing it with you, brought a cat into the house knowing you are allergic, spending money with no care if it is a need or a want, especially now that a baby is coming and her income is gone. \nDoes she have a set of rules for you that not apply to her? \nGiving you the silent treatment is to manipulate you to do what she wants, if it doesn\u2019t work, you will see the \u201ctears\u201d and the \u201cyou don\u2019t love me enough\u201d you \u201cdon\u2019t care about the baby\u201d \nThe thing is, if she would be acting like this without knowing after you brought it to her attention if she would care about you at all, she would be open to talk and get some therapy, the fact that she is blaming you and making you the bad guy after everything that you have done, is  more than telling for us that she is being selfish, abusive and all the other stuff that people have expressed. \nGood luck to you.", ">I\u2019m still in love with her so it\u2019s very hard on me right now\n\nYou won't be much longer if she doesn't get her act together. Hopefully, she doesn't want that to happen, either. \n\nIn about 3 months, you're going to learn the meaning of unconditional love. It truly blindsides you, and there's no way to prepare yourself. Just know that it will happen. Her behavior will look even worse in light of that feeling because everything will be gauged by how it affects your child and their health, happiness, and overall well-being. \n\nYou are most definitely NTA", "Speaking of moving with a clan, I got a comment earlier speaking about Viking women who want to battle even though they were pregnant I honestly find that so empowering in so different from what I\u2019m experiencing, if you do you know any more about these clans, do you mind sending me a link to them? I honestly love to branch out more into these independent women. They honestly seems so empowering. Hopefully it\u2019ll give my wife some motivation?", "Thank you for the advice!!! I really appreciate it. And yes, I can talk to some of her family members. For example, I\u2019ve been talking to her sister. They don\u2019t live in the same state sadly. But her sister is coming up to visit. I was actually texting her a little bit in the past hour. She\u2019s definitely gonna go check on her sister. Maybe talk some sense into her? Not sure what they\u2019ll discuss. But I do know that I\u2019m starting therapy. I\u2019m actually getting an appointment in a week.", "NTA  and sitting on her rump all day stuffing her face. She will gain excess weight and have weaker muscles when it's crunch time. Delivery will be harder cause her muscles are weak.  Hopefully, she gets her act together before the baby comes, or you're never going to sit down for a long time.", "Thanks for the luck, but also just to clear up some things she\u2019s never acted like this in the past. It\u2019s when she became pregnant did a lot of these symptoms start appearing that\u2019s why I\u2019ve always brushed it off as pregnancy hormones, or something else to do with a chemical imbalance in her brain I don\u2019t know, but Definitely plan on consulting a doctor because of it.", "Thank you really. Everyone has been such a help. They really open my eyes about what\u2019s really going on I just need to take some time to grieve. Definitely talk to a therapist. It seems that my relationship has sunk. All I need to focus on now is the baby and getting my mental state back in place.", "I think people of previous times did what they had to do.\n\nMy children's mother was in the army when she was pregnant and she set the woman's obstacle course record for her platoon the day she found out she was pregnant.\n\nTheir drill sergeant was yelling at all the other women 'You let a pregnant woman beat you!' for the next few weeks.  Of course that was first trimester stuff.\n\nShe remained on duty until just weeks before giving birth before then getting discharged.", "I can talk to her family members *", "That is great! Therapy is a wonderful thing, it just helps you release so much you have been holding in. Don't hold back in Therapy. I wish you all the best!", "That\u2019s such a sweet story, you must be proud of your children mother", "Thank you!!", "Tiktok is the last place someone should take advice from. That's another issue.", "They may have a fee, but it\u2019s worth it they\u2019ll do their best to find a good home.  Tell her your allergies are sooo bad you won\u2019t even be able to put her make-up on - sorry, my bad!", "\u2026not even if they\u2019re allergic??? That\u2019s not an empathy for animals issues, it\u2019s taking reasonable steps to protect one\u2019s health. Living with an animal you\u2019re allergic in the long term can cause asthma, not to mention the long-term health consequences of having constantly-elevated histamine levels\u2026", "It\u2019s cool to see an OP actually go out and ask for help/advice", "Children mother lol", "I\u2019m not sure if she took advice from TikTok but I do know that she sees things on TikTok. That\u2019s advertised to her and she wants. Hence the robe."]}
