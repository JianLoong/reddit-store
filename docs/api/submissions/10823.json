Toxoplasmosis, which lives in cat poop, is pretty much only a risk for healthy people if it is contracted while a woman is pregnant.

Unfortunately the cat will need to be rehomed, and you should stand firm in your boundaries with that one \"The cat goes, or I go\". It was incredibly disrespectful of her to do that.\n\nAlso, you're still allowed your own time. As is she. It will be important when baby comes that you two still make time for yourselves and for eachother. Baby is important, but you have to take care of yourselves and your relationship too.

Maybe hire a maid once a week and come to some agreement where she can do light house cleaning in between. The cat situation is puzzling, as normally cats aren't super friendly towards infants pulling on their fur etc. I understand the need for her to have a companion but to pick one that you would be allergic to is a head scratcher. Why not get an allergy friendly dog? (Not a puppy) If she's not doing the bare minimum to care for herself, her surroundings, you or her pet then there might be some mental issues at play. Seems like some therapy might be helpful in conjunction with regular Dr. visits. There's a big schism in communication and expectations here.", "INFO. OP it sounds like your wife is literally doing nothing but eating and sleeping. If this is the case then you are NTA.

If this is all the case, step up and take assert yourself in the relationship. Do not \"ask\" her if you can have some down time (seeing friends, going out by yourself) just tell her in advance when you are going so she is aware. Stop doing EVERYTHING and delegate some of the tasks to her. Being pregnant can be difficult at times but if your post is accurate and she has not been diagnosed as high risk and put on mandated bedrest, she needs to continue to be active for her own health, and contribute to the household for the sake of her family - all 3 of you.

Her body is changing quickly and she probably feels fat, ugly, scared, stupid plus a million other emotions. Does any of it make sense ? absolutely not.

If this is all new since pregnancy, I'd see if she'd be willing to talk to a counselor. The combination of sleep deprivation plus hormonal changes can create a neurotransmitter milieu ripe for mental health problems. Maybe she might be willing to talk to someone under the guise of couples counseling, to best prepare the both of you for the challenges of the first 6 months of having a newborn?

She never contributed anymore. She kept using the baby as an excuse or her pregnancy has an excuse, and I understand if she had complications with her pregnancy or if it was a high risk, but the doctors never said anything about her pregnancy, causing any complications. then it got to the point where I had to do massages for her and make up and nails and buy her expensive maternity clothing because she still wanted to look pretty and I understand wanting to a pretty because she might have insecurities. But again I was taking money out to buy her all of these things that she wanted to look pretty and they were pretty expensive.
