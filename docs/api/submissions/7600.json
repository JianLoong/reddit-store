We went on a cruise in a group as a lot of our friends and family were having birthdays (including me). My bf and two of my friends decided to go to dinner the second night of the cruise. The dinner was overall good, but when it came to dessert, my friends both ordered a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. When the dishes came, my boyfriend reached across the table and broke the sugar on top of my friends cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. When he did this, I was shocked because I did not understand why he would do that. I thought it was commonly known that you do not touch other peoples food, but maybe it was just the way I reacted. she did not say anything, but I looked over at him and said \u201clet\u2019s keep our hands out of other peoples food.\u201d at this he looked at me and very loudly told me to shut up and went on to say that it is in his \u201cculture\u201d to try other\u2019s food, but even if that were true, he is half Arabic and grew up in the states with a white mother so I was also so confused when he said that. \nAnyway, after the dinner, my friends told me that they found it inappropriate how he told me to shut up and I agree but when I tried to talk about it he quickly shut it down by saying I embarrassed him. Maybe I did handle the situation in a condescending manner, but I was just shocked in the moment that he had done that. It is also worth noting that a few years ago here took a bite of someone sandwich on a trip, which made them very upset because he did not ask and he just took it. I brought that up saying he should have already known it was culturally unacceptable to do that. SO AITA for how I handled the situation?", "created_utc": 1673973224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10egk6f/aita_for_reminding_my_boyfriend_of_table_manners/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At all. But you need to RUN, not walk, from this man.\n\nWere you patronising to him? Absolutely. But contextually, the situation required it. This man is 33-years-old and a flat-out boor, with table manners that I would find unacceptable in any of the many preschoolers I have taught, who by the age of 4 or 5 know better than to stick their fingers in other people's food, or help themselves to it without asking nicely. \n\nAnd his excuse about it being \"his culture to taste other people's food\"? Bullshit. I have a great deal of family in the Middle East. While SHARING FOOD and feeding others is absolutely a part of the culture, NO ONE with any manners would ever just reach over and stick their fingers into someone else's PERSONAL PLATE without saying, \"Hey, that looks yummy, can I taste it?\". Shared plates, sure, but not the plate belonging to someone. That is not a thing. Furthermore, as you note, *he was not IN the Middle East*, he was on a cruise with a bunch of Westerners, and he was raised in the United States. At 33 years old, he should know perfectly well how to behave at the table. \n\nAnd that's not even getting to the part where he spoke to you so rudely. No one should EVER tell their partner to \"shut up\" dismissively, much less in a social situation in front of other people.\n\nMost importantly, I'm exceptionally concerned that you reference this rude, mannerless, boorish man behaving in a similarly shockingly inappropriate way - taking a bite out of someone's sandwich without even asking - \"a few years ago\". This implies that you were already dating him when he was 30 and *you were a teenager*. Again, you are NTA, and it explains a lot about why you would be unaware of why his behaviour is completely unacceptable for an adult, and be willing to put up with it . . . it's literally all you know in a relationship context. But it also points to him choosing you because no woman anywhere near his age would have him, or put up with his childish, disgusting habits and rudeness.\n\nOP, you are absolutely NTA, but you deserve so much better. Please, walk away. You have your whole life ahead of you, and you do NOT need to spend one more minute of it with someone who behaves or treats you like this.", "NTA - But honestly, your BF started dating you when he was 30 and you were a teenager. Are you surprised he is immature?", "NTA. he needs to learn some MANNERS. you didn\u2019t embarrass him, he embarrassed himself. you don\u2019t touch other peoples food without asking. it\u2019s rude and unsanitary. and him telling YOU to shut up after he did that? very inappropriate. i doubt it\u2019s a culture thing, he\u2019s just acting like a child", "I've dated older men too... there's a reason these older men go for women your age and that's an immaturity on their part.  I think you see it now, right?  I wonder what else is in his culture that he would think appropriate to subject you to?\n\nNTA and maybe dump that guy?", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, regardless of the circumstances, to snap at your partner immediately and tell them to \"shut up\" like this is disgusting and a massive red flag.", "NTA\n\nReaching across the table and starting someone else\u2019s dish (especially something small in a ramekin) before they do isn\u2019t \u201ccultural\u201d or sharing, it\u2019s just fucking rude.\n\nHe\u2019s was embarrassed because his behavior is embarrassing. Your friends (and you) are right. His behavior was shocking and inappropriate. His lack of emotional regulation is doubly wild given he\u2019s 33 years old.", "NTA\n\nHe was embarrassing himself and disrespectful to your friends and yourself. I'm 99% sure \"his culture\" line is bullshit. He isn't operating in that culture even if it was true his home life has it. And it still wouldn't be cool to tell you to shut up or asked like you did something wrong. Is he going to claim that telling women to shut up is part of his culture too?\n\nI've shared food with people but it's more of an offer thing, family style plates, or a rather established thing with romantic partners. Some random friend of a romantic partner without asking? Super weird.", "NTA, granted your wording could have been better but none of us are perfect when we are shocked. \n\nthe part about the same thing happening a few years ago, well first then he should have known. Second.... a few years ago you were a teenager and this guy was in his late 20s. \n\nI have nothing to say about a thirty something and forty something dating, but you were..... very young then. An older guy who starts dating a teenager and is now telling her to shut up is concerning. Your friends have brought up how he told you to shut up. Maybe its time to have a super honest conversation with them about how they see your relationship dynamics.", "NTA\n\n<insert standard comment about problematic age gap, red flags, etc.>\n\nYou were not rude. He was rude to take a bite of someone's food without asking. He was even ruder to tell you to \"shut up\".", "NTA. You don't touch other people's food without permission.", "NTA. it's not condescending to tell someone to not touch other people's food. You can ask if you're close enough to share something like a creme brulee (personally, i dont mind a friend asking me, but my friend's boyfriend?? Yeah thats weird) what is condescending tho is telling someone to shut up and thinking they can just get a bite of anyone and everyone's food because it's their \"culture\".\n\nCulture should never be a reason to do unpleasant things to another or disrespect them. If your culture tells you to do something that may be taken as offensive by another person, especially someone coming from a different culture then refrain to do so or at the very least ask for permission.\n\nWhen he says, its his \"culture\" to try other people's food, did he try everyone else's food? Does he do it everytime? I doubt that considering that your other example of this behavior was from some years ago. If so, he did not HAVE to do it, but he chose to do so because he want to.\n\nAlso your friends are right, he shouldnt be telling you to shut up or tell you off like that for \"embarasing him\". How, exactly did you embarrass him, by telling him he was being disrespectful? Yeah, no. Be careful, some people think patriarchy and male dominance are part of their culture as well and you already have a glimpse on what he think about people 'disrespecting' his culture.", "NTA - specifically breaking the sugar on another persons br\u00fbl\u00e9e is so far beyond the pale that he should have been floating home in a dingy with no fresh water after that stunt. \n\nI\u2019m physically mad after reading that. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s the fucking Prince of Persia - there\u2019s a code around dessert. You can\u2019t declare a jihad on other peoples\u2019 confections and not expect a strong western response.  \n\n\u201cwe share food in my culture/family\u201d is a common refrain from food-thieving assholes.", "DUMP HIM\n\nHe's 33 and doesn't have basic table manners. He thinks it's acceptable to tell you to shut up. He thinks it's okay to touch other peoples food without permission. He's a prick using culture as a reason to be disrespectful. \n\nNTA", "The reason this much older guy is with you is **not** because you are so wonderfully mature and wise for your age.  It's because women his age know better than you put up with that garbage. But young women like you don't know that right away.  (Though of course you are here because you suspect it...)", "If he'd done that to my brulee, my spoon would be cracking his forehead. NTA.", "Lucky he didn't try this shit at my family's table, my grandpa would have stabbed him with a fork!", "NTA. Sharing food, if everybody agrees, and sticking your hands into food are two very different things.", "NTA. It\u2019s super inappropriate to touch other people\u2019s food. They way you said it probably was condescending, the wording sounds like something I\u2019d say to one of my young children. But like - at 33 he should not have to be reminded. It really doesn\u2019t matter if culturally it\u2019s normal for him, if other people don\u2019t consent to sharing their food!", "NTA.\n\nIs your bf 12 years older than you or 12 years *younger* than you? Kinda sorta hard to tell.\n\nHappy Belated Birthday, OP!", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.  \n\n--->You've chosen to waste your youth with a crass older guy who feels comfortable doing all that, **plus** telling you to shut up.  Think about that.\n\nYou're an asshole just for the phrasing \u201clet\u2019s keep our hands out of other peoples food.\u201d  That is how you talk to your own toddler, not any adult.", "NTA- first off he's lucky he has a hand left because if he'd stuck his spoon in my cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e he'd be missing an appendage. Second if my partner ever, EVER spoke to me that way he'd be in the wind so fast he'd have wind burn on his ass. He is very disrespectful not only to you but to your friends and while some cultures do share foods they do NOT stick their hands into other people's food. It's served in common dishes and you help yourself from the dish and not from someone's plate!", "NTA. I\u2019m Lebanese & Palestinian. This is not our culture at all. Sure, we SHARE our food and often eat family style. We are generous with OUR food, that is part of the culture. We don\u2019t smash other people\u2019s desserts. We don\u2019t reach for a bite of someone else\u2019s plate without permission. Your boyfriend is just an asshole. This is why no one his age will date him and he resorts to dating someone 12 years younger. You were 9 when he was the age you are now, he\u2019s a creep. Drop the loser and date someone your age.", "NTA. He embarrassed himself by sticking his fingers in someone else's food! And telling you to shut up? \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9He sounds disrespectful and misogynistic. Are you sure he wasn't taught middle eastern sexist views while growing up? I'd be on high alert to run.", "Nta hun if you\u2019re dating an older dude because it comes with lifestyle perks then you do you. But if you\u2019re dating an older guy because you think he\u2019s more mature an on your level- no baby no. He\u2019s only on your level because he\u2019s immature (which is ok to be at your age) but at his is damn right embarrassing. \n\nI\u2019ve been in exactly the above situation with my older bad mannered bf from a different culture. It wasn\u2019t culture or the way his mother raised him. He was just a jerk who got his jollies from rolling over other people.", "ESH\n\nHe was out of line to reach into someone else's food.  If your report of what you said is accurate, it was too much like reprimanding a child.  \n\nHowever, his continuing to reach into others' meals and take food is a bigger issue.  You may want to evaluate why he refuses to consider dining companions' comfort.  Even if he's correct that it's a cultural difference, not having consideration for others' expectation of correct behavior and personal space is rude.  Why does he need to push his version of correctness to the point of making his companions (including you) uncomfortable?  This seems arrogant and unmannerly to me.", "ESH, but your boyfriend MUCH more than you.\n\nYou were pretty condescending in the way you reprimanded him. It sounds like something you would say to a toddler, not a grown adult. Personally, I'd have said something more like, \"the fuck, dude? that's not your food.\"\n\nThat said, your boyfriend is a MASSIVE AH. Why's he out here just taking other people's food? It sounds like he has a serious case of main character syndrome that he needs to get over, and fast.", "ESH, but he is more the A than you. Your boyfriend (hopefully now ex\u2013 ?) sucks for reaching across the table and interfering with your friend's food! Sharing off someone else's plate is a very intimate act. Does he know her well enough to do that? Probably not given how shocked everyone at the table was. And, no, he doesn't get to take a pass because of his \"culture.\" If he grew up in the United States, he's American. \n\nFor your part, though, you chastised him as if he were a kindergartner and you were his teacher. You could have apologized to your friend for your boyfriend's behavior. You could have taken the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e from your friend, given it to your boyfriend, and then ordered another cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e right away for your friend. Ultimately, though, the manner in which you chose to chastise him really was a bridge too far.", "ESH", "ESH - but I would split it 80% him, 20% you.  He was wrong for his actions and his response.  Just reading what you said though, it comes off condescending, like you are talking to a little kid - not like an adult.  It seems like unnecessary fuel to the fire.  I am sure he probably took that as disrespectful as well, which is why you got the crappy response you did.\n\nI am a big proponent if your partner makes a mistake, doesn't know something, etc., to try to remind them in private.  You don't want one embarrassment to turn into two.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Listen to your friends, don't let anyone talk to you like that.  It's not his culture, it's him that's rude.", "NTA. He acted like a child and so you spoke to him as such. And the fact that he's 33, responded with more rudeness and tried to justify his behavior by claiming it's cultural when it's actually not, just NO. Please run.", "NTA - Ewwww x10000. This is not cultural, he simply has no manners whatsoever and refuses to be held accountable for his actions.\n\nHe also does not get to tell you to shut up, or any other such poor behavior, atop of assaulting someone else's food. That behavior is not okay in ANY culture, he is simply a gross and entitled AH who is using his age difference with you in the hopes you won't know exactly what a screw-up he up.\n\nThere's a reason women his age won't date him... They all know better and won't tolerate his nonsense. Be one of those women - toss him out on his tush.", "No, it's not in his culture. Both my parents are Arabic and I've always been taught not only to not touch other people's food but also their cutlery.\n\nBit of an age difference I must add. Is it normal for him to tell you to shut up?.\n\nNTA but you might want to review your relationship.", "There's so much wrong with this story, between the age difference, his humiliating you, and his abusive/bullying behavior, they're all awful. You're in for a rough road if you marry this guy and if I were your mother, I'd beg you to get away from him. NTA", "Why date someone 12 years older?!", "NTA but your boyfriend is.  And telling you to shut up? Not okay.  Yes you called him out but seriously I\u2019m not sure many people wouldn\u2019t.  Boyfriend is AH", "NTA. Also consider this behavior in context with dating someone 12 years younger and everything else this guy does.", "They've been together since she was a teenager!", "OP, please listen to FoolMe1nceShameOnU\n\nThis is not a good boyfriend. This is a creep that has zero manners and it's also supremely creepy if you were dating this asshat when you were a teen. \n\nAlso, you are NTA. Your BF is however.", "Thank you. I\u2019m Lebanese as well and no way in hell would anyone ever do that. Even when we have Mezza we put some on our plates from the communal dish and rarely even ask to try let alone touch anyone\u2019s food.", "My late FIL would have done the same.", "I literally had a friend who I no longer talk to because they cracked the sugar on my creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, they knew it is one of my favorite things in the world and did it just to be an ass.", "Girl, run, don't walk, away from this child. The only reason he's dating someone younger is cause people his age know better. Don't fall for his BS. Get yourself out and live free from the dead weight.", "You did nothing wrong! You should be proud you said something at all for real. This guy is a brute!", "Please don't take the blame for his abusive behavior.", "OP, you're in an abusive relationship and I hope you can see it soon before he impregnates you and/or start beating you.  Please read the book u/sylvrn recommends - it is absolutely an eye opener.\n\nNO ONE should ever shout at you to shut up in a public setting like he did.\n\nYou deserve better.\n\nIf you were talking to him like a toddler - then how do you describe how he talked to you?\n\nYou deserve better."]}
