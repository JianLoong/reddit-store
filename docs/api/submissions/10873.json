The people you brush off as just \"wife\" and \"kid\" are absolutely members of his family.  They should be there in person,  but a necklace and ring are the closest thing he can get to that.  I'd tell you to drop this and back off, but it's better for your fiance to see the real you now.  YTA", "HIS family. Not some random \"whole other family\". **HIS** family!!!\n\nYTA, entirely. Matter of fact, if you are this controlling and insecure about this simple honoring his DEAD brother, SIL and nibbling - on one of the most important days of his life - you need to just call it off and go away. He deserves someone who loves him for exactly who he is, past and all.", "Info: why didn\u2019t this necklace go to his brother\u2019s wife or kid?", "This is not a whole other family, it\u2019s his family. And it\u2019s clearly his way of still keeping them close to him. The fact you don\u2019t understand that basic emotion makes me question your empathy in general. And yes you sound jealous.", "If you care this much about something SO small that will make your fianc\u00e9 feel better (about his family who DIED, no less) your marriage is already doomed.", "We need more context. Did all 3 of them die?", "If you care about the marriage, and not just the wedding, you\u2019ll gather your senses real quick and realize this is not the hill to die on. I\u2019ve been to several weddings where the couple honors family members who have passed, whether it\u2019s with a reading, or empty chairs with the family members picture. Your fianc\u00e9 is choosing to do this by continuing to wear the necklace he wears daily. He isn\u2019t wearing a \u201cwhole other family\u2019s name\u201d on your wedding day, he\u2019s honoring and remembering the family he lost, family that would have been your family too. If you care about the marriage, the relationship, then support him.", "[removed]", "By that reasoning, his family is not your family and your husband to be won\u2019t be part of your family should he unfortunately pass away.  If someone from your family dies, you would be a ok with him giving zero shits because they aren\u2019t  his family?  There has to be something else going on here.  Are you insecure, jealous, upset that he doesn\u2019t carry something with your initials on it?  This is a hill I would die on if I was your fianc\u00e9.", "There is something missing in you. Definitely a complete lack of empathy. You are one cold woman.", "Right. Im still waiting for a reply from OP. Is the entire family dead? Because wow\u2026 she needs to chill out.\n\nConfirmed. They are all dead\u2026 wow. This lady is insane.", "EXACTLY\n\nLike excuse him for wanting to keep his dead brother close at his wedding.\n\nJesus fkn Christ.\n\n\nGET SOME FUCKING THERAPY OP BECAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS OF THE CARE HE HAS FOR THE MEMORY OF HIS DEAD BROTHER.", "There it is. It\u2019s not really about the look. You\u2019re genuinely jealous of his DEAD brother. I suggest you speak with a therapist about why this bothers you so much.", "> it feels like he's making our wedding day about his brother you know? \n\nHe's doing nothing different than he does every day and you claim to be fine with it then.  How does it suddenly become all about his brother on your wedding day, but not all about his brother on any other day he wears them?   Also you compare his late brother's necklace (and ring) that he wears everyday in memory of him with a gift your living mother gave you that doesn't match the aesthetic for the day. Sorry, YTA here.", "You\u2019re about to not have a wedding day at all if you push it!", "No he isnt weirdo he is wearing jewelry he wears all the time of HIS DEAD FAMILY MEMBERS.\n\nYou are clearly too immature for this type of relationship.\n\nHIS FAMILY DIED YOU GIANT P.O.S and you are worried iT takes Away FroM mE NEWS FLASH you are an awful person.", ">he's making our wedding day about his brother you know?\n\nNo.  I don't think anyone here knows or can comprehend your thought process in this.  Why exactly are you jealous of 3 dead members of his family? There is absolutely no justification for you acting like this.  YTA", "It's actually fucking disgusting that you're jealous of his DEAD BROTHER.", "Dude wtf", "You need to re-evaluate something\u2019s lady.", "A ring and a necklace doesn\u2019t make your wedding about his late brother. Many people devote a whole table with pictures and quotes and sometimes carry tokens so passed loved ones can be there with them. \n\nIf alive your fianc\u00e9s brother would probably be in in the wedding. Would it be all about him then?", "Unless it's huge like something Flavor Flav would wear, nobody is going to notice it.  YTA.", "Who do you think is going to be looking at them? Is someone going to notice who they belonged to and bring it up in a speech? This is a quick way to end a relationship", "This is who he is.  A man with a dead brother and family. You are being extremely self-absorbed and callous right now.  A necklace is not making your whole wedding about them. It's making what he's wearing on his neck about the", "My cousin made it all about Mens Warehouse since all the clothes he wore had that name on them where nobody could see", "How are you jealous of his dead family member? Jesus Christ lady. You\u2019re not ready for marriage. YTA.", "Jealous of three dead people. One of them being a child.", "OP just confirmed in another response that there is no widow and child.  They passed as well.   The finance lost his brother, sister-in-law, AND neice.  Awful. OP is a huge asshole.", "I misread this comment.", "My impression from her post is that it doesn't match her dress. And she's shallow.", "If the answer is what I think it is, that makes her even more of an AH", "They've also passed", "Yes.

You are extremely self centered, id surprised if your husband even chooses to go through with a wedding now after seeing what kind of person you are.", "Jesus, you're cold.", "Omg", "Wow the cruelty your showing is disgusting. Your actions are going against everything that marriage is supposed to be about. Instead of celebrating your love and joining families, you are hounding him to get rid of a symbol of his family.
