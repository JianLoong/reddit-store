Just wow.", "YTA, no doubt about it. Have you no sympathy or empathy?

His brother,  sister in law and niece are dead. He still wants them, and rightly so as a part of his wedding.  The ring and necklace are his way of doing that.  Also I'm a little lost on just how it will really effect the pictures ??  A necklace is easily concealed under a shirt or tie. Unless you are getting married in the nude??

( We're a big family don't judge) It was made clear and will be made clear when the unmarried do marry that lost brother will be included in some way so we can still feel he's there, weather actually true or not.  And any attempt to not allow this in any way,(  OP in your case the necklace and ring ) is a 100000000000000000000000% deal breaker and the entire thing would be called off and you'd be an EX.", "YTA, they have all passed, I'd be upset, too.

OPs decision to not wear her moms necklace is up to her, but i doubt that the finance is dictating anything she can or cannot wear on the wedding day.", "This makes me feel sick", "OMG, it's his family. \n\nI cannot.

Think about how you wanted to be treated by his family after you marry. \n\nYTA 1000% and for your sake, I hope you didn\u2019t explain your reasoning out loud to your fianc\u00e9 because if you did, I\u2019d be shocked if he stayed.", "A while other family\u2026.

I'm sure it's happened but I don't remember ever seeing someone with a necklace \\*outside\\* of the dress shirt of a tux.", "Thank you. Honestly my boyfriend is wonderful and he gives as good as he gets.", "Fuck! Poor dude \ud83d\udc94", "I'm going to list all the ways we honored my dad's memory at my wedding, and I want you to try to understand how many other things happen at a wedding, and how it all blends together. \nAt my wedding, I wore a necklace holding the ring my dad gave my mom. No one knew that except those who asked, my mom, and my partner. On my bouquet, I had a small picture of my dad safety pinned to the ribbon, so he could walk me down the aisle. My bridesmaids, my mom, and my photographer knew. No one else paid attention. At the ceremony, he had a seat in the front row, where a picture of him, an old shirt of his, and some flowers and a poem sat. I'm sure some wedding guests saw it, but it was in the front row so I'm assuming it was easily missed. Next, his name was on our entry sign (we skipped programs and printed one big sign basically) at the bottom, with something about missing his presence, alongside my partners grandfather's name. Lastly, the DJ gave my dad a little shout-out before the parent dances during the reception. The last two things may have been the only times a 'standard' guest may have noticed the tributes.\n\nOutside of those moments, we had dozens of times to showcase our love for one another. I felt like the star of the show, incredibly loved and valued, and so did my partner. We talk about our wedding being the most fun evening of our life. Not once did my spouse ask me to change the memorials to my dad, because everyone knew it was important for me to feel like he was there. Because he was my dad. \n\nYou're talking about your fiance's brother. The first friend he ever had, the person he's known his whole life, who lived alongside him in his childhood. It's a fucking necklace. I hardly believe anyone is going to notice it, let alone care. So the real question is... Why do you care so much? The aesthetic? The pictures? The ones where your fiance can see a piece of his brother in them, because there won't be any pictures of them together on his wedding day. He won't get to hold his niece or see his sister in law either, from the sound of your comments. Let his family be with him on his wedding day.", ">I do understand that but it feels like he's making our wedding day about his brother you know?\n\nDo you have siblings? Are they invited to the wedding? Or hell, are any of your family going to be at the wedding?\n\nBecause this is the only way he can have his late brother, late sister in law and late niece with him at the wedding. If that means he's making the wedding day about his brother, surely you inviting any of your family would do that even moreso?\n\nIsn't part of the point of the wedding to share your love with your loved ones? Assuming that your family will in fact be there, why is it okay for you to do so but not for him?", "YTA. Have you ever had a close loved one die? He probably thinks about his brother *every* day and wears the necklace to honor him and to *not* forget him. Yes, that includes your wedding day. In fact, he may be thinking about him more that day, wishing his brother could have been there.", "OP, he wears both every day so he is NOT suddenly making the wedding day *about* his brother. He\u2019s simply having him present in a small way at one of the most important days of his life.\n\nPlease stop worrying about aesthetics. Weddings are not about aesthetics. They are ultimately about love and bringing people together. I say this with kindness and without judgement, but if you are more concerned about how things *look* than you are about your future husband\u2019s *feelings,* especially on such an important day, then you might want to think about why you\u2019re getting married at all. And if you push this, he might start to think about it himself.\n\nEdit to add post judgment: soft YTA, because I really do hope you\u2019ve just gotten caught up in all of the planning that\u2019s gone into the wedding and wanting it to be perfect and just had a momentary brain-fart.", "Him wearing two pieces of jewelry is not \u201cmaking your wedding about his brother\u201d. At this point I\u2019d be very surprised if your fianc\u00e9 even chooses to go through with this wedding based on how incredibly selfish and inconsiderate you\u2019re being. You\u2019ve given him a peek at what your lives are going to be like together, and you\u2019ve shown him it will be awful if you act this way.", "I\u2019m guessing if his brother was alive he\u2019d be his Best Man. I\u2019m guessing his late SIL would have been happy to be involved in whatever capacity. This is a day he most likely grew up thinking his brother would be right next to him for. His brother DIED so yes he is prolly trying to find anyway to keep his brothers memory alive in thsi happy day he had always hoped to share with his built in best friend. Are you an only child? Because that\u2019s the only way you wouldn\u2019t understand the magnitude of this situation. I\u2019m currently planning my own wedding and couldn\u2019t imagine it without my sister so I feel for your groom and pray that you find empathy at some point because he deserves someone who loves him enough to realize how important this is to him.", "You are a bad person and you should feel bad about yourself.", "Is he making every single day about his brother by wearing the jewelry? How does jewelry dictate the theme for a wedding?? YTA OP get your head out of your ass", "He isn\u2019t making about his brother wtf. He\u2019s making sure HE feels like HE has a wedding that incorporates what is important to him. \n\nI\u2019m seeing red. YTA YTA YTA.", "Big deal? It's not like he is posting a banner and hiring a sky writer. It's a necklace and a ring. It hardly takes over an entire day.\n\nYou sound rather lacking in empathy.", "Also known as your fianc\u00e9's sister-in-law and his niece.  Stop being such an AH and only referring to them in relationship to the brother as if they were complete strangers to your fianc\u00e9 - they were your fianc\u00e9's family, too.  Your fianc\u00e9 was a brother-in-law to that woman and an uncle to that child.", "You know weddings are about family, right? I'm sure he would definitely prefer they were there in person. Do you have no empathy? Compassion?", "And who\u2019s going to know, or pay attention to that detail? I\u2019ve been to weddings where pictures of deceased family members were included, where jewelry made from cremains was worn - didn\u2019t take anything away from the day. Guests took note and moved on. You\u2019re the only one who\u2019s going to perseverate.", "That he wears, by your account, every single day.  He\u2019s not making his wedding day about them, he\u2019s continuing a tribute to them which he does EVERY DAY.  I wore my fathers ugly cuff links and tie tack.  Why?  Because family is a part of the ceremony.  Your family, his family, soon to be both of your families.  Do you consider the father of the bride walking them down the aisle to be \u201cmaking the wedding about Her father?\u201d  Do you consider the mother-son dance to be \u201cmaking the wedding about His mother?\u201d  When the little cousin is asked to be the flower girl or ring bearer, is the wedding now about them?\n\nNo, because that would be idiotic.  The wedding is a celebration about joining two families.  You include those families in some capacity.  He wants to continue including his family that has passed, and you\u2019re a gigantic asshole for obsessing about something as trivial as a necklace.", "Wearing a necklace can in now way be construed as \"making the day about his brother \" YTA", "Leave it alone. You\u2019re seriously willing to cause harm to your fianc\u00e9 and your relationship over this? Tell me you haven\u2019t lost someone way too young without saying it.

It\u2019s not too much for people you love and miss and think about all the time. He will be sad that his brother and brother\u2019s family won\u2019t be there already.
