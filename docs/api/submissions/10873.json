It's apparently something he values extremely. So why even ask? You know what they mean to him. Of course they'll be on on a day like this.

Just wow.", "YTA, no doubt about it. Have you no sympathy or empathy? And it sounds like his brother's wife and daughter died as well so I can only imagine it was an unfortunate and awful passing that he probably still feels traumatized about.

His brother,  sister in law and niece are dead. He still wants them, and rightly so as a part of his wedding.  The ring and necklace are his way of doing that.  Also I'm a little lost on just how it will really effect the pictures ??  A necklace is easily concealed under a shirt or tie. Unless you are getting married in the nude??

( We're a big family don't judge) It was made clear and will be made clear when the unmarried do marry that lost brother will be included in some way so we can still feel he's there, weather actually true or not.  And any attempt to not allow this in any way,(  OP in your case the necklace and ring ) is a 100000000000000000000000% deal breaker and the entire thing would be called off and you'd be an EX.", "YTA, they have all passed, I'd be upset, too.

Poor dude \ud83d\udc94", "I'm going to list all the ways we honored my dad's memory at my wedding, and I want you to try to understand how many other things happen at a wedding, and how it all blends together. \nAt my wedding, I wore a necklace holding the ring my dad gave my mom. No one knew that except those who asked, my mom, and my partner. On my bouquet, I had a small picture of my dad safety pinned to the ribbon, so he could walk me down the aisle. My bridesmaids, my mom, and my photographer knew. No one else paid attention. At the ceremony, he had a seat in the front row, where a picture of him, an old shirt of his, and some flowers and a poem sat. I'm sure some wedding guests saw it, but it was in the front row so I'm assuming it was easily missed. Next, his name was on our entry sign (we skipped programs and printed one big sign basically) at the bottom, with something about missing his presence, alongside my partners grandfather's name. Lastly, the DJ gave my dad a little shout-out before the parent dances during the reception. The last two things may have been the only times a 'standard' guest may have noticed the tributes.\n\nOutside of those moments, we had dozens of times to showcase our love for one another. I felt like the star of the show, incredibly loved and valued, and so did my partner. We talk about our wedding being the most fun evening of our life. Not once did my spouse ask me to change the memorials to my dad, because everyone knew it was important for me to feel like he was there. Because he was my dad. \n\nYou're talking about your fiance's brother. The first friend he ever had, the person he's known his whole life, who lived alongside him in his childhood. It's a fucking necklace. I hardly believe anyone is going to notice it, let alone care. So the real question is... Why do you care so much? The aesthetic? The pictures? The ones where your fiance can see a piece of his brother in them, because there won't be any pictures of them together on his wedding day. He won't get to hold his niece or see his sister in law either, from the sound of your comments. Let his family be with him on his wedding day.", ">I do understand that but it feels like he's making our wedding day about his brother you know?\n\nDo you have siblings? Are they invited to the wedding? Or hell, are any of your family going to be at the wedding?\n\nBecause this is the only way he can have his late brother, late sister in law and late niece with him at the wedding. If that means he's making the wedding day about his brother, surely you inviting any of your family would do that even moreso?\n\nIsn't part of the point of the wedding to share your love with your loved ones? Assuming that your family will in fact be there, why is it okay for you to do so but not for him?", "YTA. Have you ever had a close loved one die? He probably thinks about his brother *every* day and wears the necklace to honor him and to *not* forget him. Yes, that includes your wedding day. In fact, he may be thinking about him more that day, wishing his brother could have been there.", "OP, he wears both every day so he is NOT suddenly making the wedding day *about* his brother. He\u2019s simply having him present in a small way at one of the most important days of his life.\n\nPlease stop worrying about aesthetics. Weddings are not about aesthetics. They are ultimately about love and bringing people together. I say this with kindness and without judgement, but if you are more concerned about how things *look* than you are about your future husband\u2019s *feelings,* especially on such an important day, then you might want to think about why you\u2019re getting married at all.

If I'm wrong I'm wrong but that's the vibe this gives. So first of all wearing the necklace regularly is understandable on even a normal day but I would say his wedding day is the day it's most emotionally important to wear it. If his brother is deceased then he can't physically be there and wearing the necklace would make your fiance feel like his brother was with him.\n\nAlso depending on what he's going to wear clothing wise he could easily have it tucked into his shirt although that is not something he should feel forced to do. If he wants to wear it visibly he has that right. \n\nSo I have to ask, why does it matter to you if he wears it? What's the issue with it? Your choice not to wear the necklace given to you by your mother is a personal one and has no impact on his choice to wear his necklace.
