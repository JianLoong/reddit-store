Her husband lost his job 2 years ago and hasn't worked since. They lost their apartment and are currently living in a camper trailer\n\nSince her older 2 children are girls we often send her nice clothes our children have grown out of because her children are growing into them. I've also helped my sister financially buying her food, paying her power bill when she couldn't pay it, etc. My husband, dad, and brother also completely set up everything for her camper ( power, plumbing, etc). My parents have tried to help financially as well. \n\nHowever they aren't helping themselves. They are constantly spending money on frivolous things, their credit is wrecked so they can't get anything nicer. My sister is still paying on student loans, they are drowning in debt and haven't stopped digging yet. Also their yard looks like a toys r us and a garbage truck collided and blew up, there are toys and trash everywhere. \n\nMy brother on the other hand has followed our dad into construction. He is a framer and our dad does plumbing. He has been doing well for himself and has saved up a decent chunk of change. \n\nSo my brother and my dad called and told me they wanted a house that was on foreclosure. I dug into it and got everything together. We put in an offer. We were the highest bidders and the offer was accepted. My brother didn't have the full cash amount ( we were aware and planned to help already) but had most of it so my husband and I along with my father threw in the rest. My brother got a loan and immediately paid us back. \n\nThe house needs some work but it isn't awful. Just small stuff. \n\nMy sister found out we helped and now she is furious that we would give him money and buy a house for him but wouldn't do the same for her. \n\nWe tried to explain that he paid us back immediately afterward he just needed the advance cash right then. \n\nShe has been very angry and has told the entire family we are picking favorites and our brother got a house but she is left to fend for herself. The family knows what actually happened and she is angry no one has taken her side as well.\n\nI've done everything in my power to help her but we aren't going to just buy her a house. They have proven that they aren't financially responsible and wouldn't be able to even keep up with the regular expenses of being a homeowner. \n\nAll of this has left a sour taste in my mouth and I am thinking about just not even helping her anymore if this is how she is going to act. \n\nWIBTA if I stopped helping her?", "created_utc": 1669704664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7m52y/wibta_if_i_stopped_helping_my_sister/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I recently had a family member go homeless and helped as much as I could. \nBut I am echoing what a friend told me: don't help so much that it hurts you. \nPossibility of a hybrid way to fix things: instead of buying a house etc, is it possible to reach out to local assistance on her behalf to help them find a better home? (I.e. replacement services, habitat for humanity etc)?? \nI am thinking if she had something more than a camper it would be more helpful. She would actually take pride in that and go \"straight\" so to speak. \n\nThat and I am just worried about hose kids in such a small space and depending on where they live, the cold could still be brutal in a camper.", "NTA\n\nTell her your brother paid you back a week after you leant him the money... can she do the same?  The answer will be no.\n\nI'd be setting some boundaries.  If she's going to be a dick about all of this, she may find you pull right back and there is little help.  The kids may end up being collateral but it's not your doing.  It's their parent lack of sorting themselves out that's the issue.  They've never really had to change because someone has always stepping in and fixed the hole they had gotten themselves into!  Maybe that needs to stop.", "You wanted to help her family and she's gotten so used to it she thinks you owe it to her.

Your sister keeps digging this hole for herself, and keeps going \u201cwoe is me, how did I get in this hole!\u201d She needs to learn that her actions have consequences. \n\nIf I were you, I would stop financially supporting her so she learns to save money for her *needs*, not her *wants*. Also, two years of her S/O not having a job!? Why is his behavior continuing to be enabled (assuming he isn\u2019t disabled or there isnt a valid reason for it)? At the end of the day, that\u2019s your choice. But just realize that she will do anything she can to make sure you keep giving her money, which is why she\u2019s suddenly playing the victim game.\n\nYour brother has been doing well for himself, and has paid you back. I highly doubt your sister has paid you back for anything.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is using you, she\u2019s gotten comfortable having you pay for everything and is trying to guilt trip you into giving her even more. She\u2019s being incredibly ungrateful and quite frankly I think her and her husband need the shock of you not helping in order for them to pull their lives together.", "NTA - Your brother was asking for a short term LOAN and your sister is entitled and is expecting you to foot the bill for her entire lifestyle without giving up the things she wants to spend her money on.  \n\nDon't set yourself on fire to try and keep her warm.  Her husband should be getting a job and they shouldn't be living so frivolously.", "NTA - Your sister's finances are NOT your responsibility.\n\nFrom what you describe, helping her financially might actually be an enabler keeping her from having to face as much of the consequences for her decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, your sister is the AH for acting like she deserves any of your money.", "NTA, you were doing a business deal with your brother, and your sister is just looking for a handout. It\u2019s your choice if you help her, it\u2019s not your responsibility.", "NTA and stop being an enabler. That\u2019s goes for all of y\u2019all. It\u2019s one thing to help when the person/people needing help are giving it everything they have and they still can\u2019t makes ends meet.

Your sister still owes student loans. There's no chance she's paying, is there?\n\nThe problem they have is that if you help them now, it only makes things worse for you in the future, because they'll keep coming back asking for more and more and more. So your best option is to say no to any kind of financial support. You can keep helping the kids with physical goods, as long as you keep a close eye on them to see that they're going where you want them to go. But that's about all you can do.", "NTA But everyone needs to stop bailing her out.", "NTA, but I would say this. The kids are innocent parties in all of this, no matter how it plays out with your sister. Do what you can for them, without shelling out for the adults.", "I get it, completely, but don't stop helping. She's very young, in a shit situation, and I suspect quite depressed. Her anger is misplaced, and I don't want it to sound like I'm taking her side because I am not. As an outsider, I think her outburst seems like an explosion of pent up stress and frustration more than an actual expectation that you would buy her a house. \n\nI hope you let it go eventually. Don't stop handing down clothes. Have boundaries that protect your heart, but try to make room for her giant feelings about debt and responsibility as a parent. Do tell her how hurt you are over the implication that you don't help her as much as you do and can.", "Poverty is a spiral and your support has kept then afloat you can spend your money any way you want. You seem pretty judgemental of your sister which is fine i guess. Life happens. Your brother isn't even the same age when your sister had a kid. I'm sure a home at 21 would have been very helpful to your sister. That's why I see she blew up. Hard to believe a 21 yo paid back a down payment on a home so quick in this economy. Drowning in debt and can't stop digging. Real easy to say when you have never been in crushing debt. This subreddit has an attitude of \"you don't owe anyone anything\" but that is not true you owe it to yourself to be kind and a morally good person. If you are in a position to help a person you love by GIVING them stuff you do. You don't give gifts with an expectation of anything in return. \n\nI been lurking for a bit and nothing is ever cut and dry only you know the workings of your interpersonal relationship. A majority of these posts are people feeling bad about doing something they been thinking about doing and wanting someone to give them an out of feeling like an asshole. \n\nYour sister's position is irrelevant. What matters is this do you want to stop helping your sister and not feel bad about it? Literally just do it. Whether or not your the AH in this situation is purely how you will feel and only you know that.", "NTA\n\nThis exactly, in dutch a similar saying goes either:\nDon't look a given horses in the mouth\nAnd another saying is:\nYou offer a hand, they take an arm", "Its a common enough saying in English too \"don't look a gift horse in the mouth\"\n\nDoesn't change that its an absolutely idiotic saying. You ALWAYS look a gift horse in the mouth. Thats the main way to tell age. If you don't youre gonna end up with a 27 year old nag that is going to have so many problems that its going to put a vets daughter through college in the few short years it has left before it dies.\n\nSorry. As someone that has been around horses all my life, I really hate that saying.", "NTA. \nYou cannot help someone who is unwilling to help themselves.", "Uhhhh\n\nSo, you look in a horse's mouth to assess its age. You'd presumably do this for any horse you were planning to buy, to assess its value. \n\nI think the saying means \"if the horse is a gift, don't look in its mouth and start assessing its value. It's a gift. Accept it wholeheartedly and with gratitude, whatever it may be.\"\n\nSo the saying applied to this situation would imply that the sister should be grateful for any help she received, instead of looking at her gift's mouth and moaning that her brother's horse was younger.\n\nEdit: a modern version of the saying could be \"when someone hands you a gift, don't turn it over trying to find the price tag.\"", "NTA playing favourites only applies to parents and grandparents.
