My husband is a home builder, I am a realtor. My husband and I have done well for ourselves. \n\nMy sister is a cosmetologist and she is struggling hard. She has 3 children ages 5, 3, and 1. Her husband lost his job 2 years ago and hasn't worked since. They lost their apartment and are currently living in a camper trailer\n\nSince her older 2 children are girls we often send her nice clothes our children have grown out of because her children are growing into them. I've also helped my sister financially buying her food, paying her power bill when she couldn't pay it, etc. My husband, dad, and brother also completely set up everything for her camper ( power, plumbing, etc). My parents have tried to help financially as well. \n\nHowever they aren't helping themselves. They are constantly spending money on frivolous things, their credit is wrecked so they can't get anything nicer. My sister is still paying on student loans, they are drowning in debt and haven't stopped digging yet. Also their yard looks like a toys r us and a garbage truck collided and blew up, there are toys and trash everywhere. \n\nMy brother on the other hand has followed our dad into construction. He is a framer and our dad does plumbing. He has been doing well for himself and has saved up a decent chunk of change. \n\nSo my brother and my dad called and told me they wanted a house that was on foreclosure. I dug into it and got everything together. We put in an offer. We were the highest bidders and the offer was accepted. My brother didn't have the full cash amount ( we were aware and planned to help already) but had most of it so my husband and I along with my father threw in the rest. My brother got a loan and immediately paid us back. \n\nThe house needs some work but it isn't awful. Just small stuff. \n\nMy sister found out we helped and now she is furious that we would give him money and buy a house for him but wouldn't do the same for her. \n\nWe tried to explain that he paid us back immediately afterward he just needed the advance cash right then. \n\nShe has been very angry and has told the entire family we are picking favorites and our brother got a house but she is left to fend for herself. The family knows what actually happened and she is angry no one has taken her side as well.\n\nI've done everything in my power to help her but we aren't going to just buy her a house. They have proven that they aren't financially responsible and wouldn't be able to even keep up with the regular expenses of being a homeowner. \n\nAll of this has left a sour taste in my mouth and I am thinking about just not even helping her anymore if this is how she is going to act. \n\nWIBTA if I stopped helping her?\n\nEdit because people have asked- her husband isn't helpless. He was a Marine and then worked as a car salesman until he lost his job. He seemed decent at it. There is nothing wrong with him. He spends time keeping himself in shape so there is no reason he shouldn't be able to work any kind of job. \n\nHe has managed to tick off every man in my family and most of the women though. Even my husband can't stand him and my husband likes everybody. My dad tried to get him working with him but he didn't like it and left after 2 days and my brother asked but it never went anywhere.", "created_utc": 1669704664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7m52y/wibta_if_i_stopped_helping_my_sister/", "score": 675, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's just rude.\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment, a book is not a living thing you need to feed, take to the vet, etc. I think the original point of contention was the fact that if someone is gifting you a fucking horse, you need to know everything about it before you accept, otherwise it's worse than not gifting anything.\n\nThat's why the saying doesn't \"quite fit\" anymore - not many people have horses anymore, so the gift of a horse is a significant burden you would want to double check.", "Oh I don't disagree that it's outdated.

But reality is that the kids lives' will suffer if you stop helping. Using your sister's unkind words as a springboard for a broader discussion about her lifestyle and how she chooses to live makes you and others uneasy and uncertain about helping her is certainly warranted. If she chooses to break contact with you after this discussion, so be it, problem solved. Since Sister is clearly the AH, then coupled with your question, I think ESH is the best judgement.

When this saying was originated a horse was much more than that.  Think of it more like \"If someone gives you a car for free don't complain about how many miles it has on it\".   A horse was a valuable thing (it still is but for different reasons) whether it was as transportation, as a working animal in the fields or eventually sold for meat.  If it was alive it had value.
