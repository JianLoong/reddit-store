Sure, you could run with the \"not the asshole, she asked repeatedly and you answered, not your responsibility\" you'll inevitably get, but that doesn't help you now or in the future.\n\nYour girlfriend weighed herself, refused to wear a swimsuit because of it, and repeatedly asked if she was fat. She was clearly having a crisis or a breakdown because of it, with her brain spiders telling her she was fat and worthless and unworthy of going to the beach; her repeatedly asking was trying to get you to confirm that fact to justify the crisis she was having. Trying to logic her out of that is like trying to logic somebody out of a panic attack; you really can't, you've just got to steer things away from the crash as best you can, and you didn't do that. You're not obligated to keep trying at this point or to support her, as AITA will certainly tell you, but in the future if you recognize a mental health crisis like this as happening you'll be better off not treating it like a rational conversation in the moment.", "NTA.
