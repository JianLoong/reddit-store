Your husband stood up for you and the family by requiring them to get along with you or go no contact. They chose no contact. But now he has changed his mind and you didn\u2019t state why exactly. If all you said is true, and there wasn\u2019t any communication with husband and family behind your back, husband should know better. If not when he contacted them but now. They have chosen to forgo a relationship with you, again. They will continue to make this choice. He needs to come to terms with this or there is something else going on either we or you don\u2019t know about. \nAlso, not a great idea to reintroduce the idea of a relationship with grandparents without more work done between the adults. But it is what it is. They don\u2019t need to be confused by this, just explain that Thanksgiving is going to be just for your family.", "Info: You\u2019ve been no contact with them for years and they\u2019ve treated you poorly, why would you even want to spend thanksgiving with them?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had a very rejecting mother and she died some months ago in her late '80s and what I really mourned was that I was still, at a pretty advanced age, hoping that we could have a rapprochement and I could have the relationship with her I had always wanted.  It's not a matter of his wrong but a matter of he has to stick to the no contact. And it's hard."]}
