{"id": 33742, "submission_id": "18r28he", "title": "AITA to dislike my family", "selftext": "\n\nAll my life, I felt like I've been dealt the shittiest hand of cards. My family is quite well off so I can't complain about financial struggles while growing up. However, I've never really got along with my sisters (elder one to be specific). I've always been forced to be the reliable one since the elder one basically decided to screw up. I know that there's a lot of pressure on first Borns but for me it felt like I was the first born. I had to do everything for myself and I didn't have a safe space to breakdown. The elder one turned to alcohol as a means of coping with childhood trauma(my parents fucked up alot), and so basically I was the one left to clean up the mess. It got so bad that she tried to self harm. I got a lot of anxiety problems due to the pressure on me but I'll never tell them that was the reason for my anxiety attacks.They( parents and psychologists) think I was doing it for attention( I don't think even know why they would think that but it's fine). My parents, keeping up with the African stereotype, cut ME off my meds and basically gaslit me into not going for therapy for my anxiety issues despite the doctor's advice whilst the Elder one got full support. The elder one,keeping up to the stereotype, did nothing but continue screwing up, receiving full support from them when she screws up, while I was struggling mentally. I really did think of ending things at the time. Imagine having untreated anxiety issues while in school and you can't do anything but struggle to survive. Most people couldn't tell what I was going through because of the happy facade I had going on but I was really at my lowest( I still am at that point).\n\nThe irony is whenever the elder one screws up they'll always come and complain about her to me and eventually they'll welcome her back and forget whatever shitty stuff she's put the rest of us through. The only reason I'm living right now is because I don't want my little brother to suffer because of these idiots.\nI don't think I've ever had support from these guys. I did well in my high school exams(like extremely well that I had really high chances of going to an ivy league) but do you know what they did. We had some celebration dinner planned with my former high school guys but on the way, we kinda got lost and they all turned on me saying that I had to forgo the event because we were getting 'lost' on the way. The place was five minutes away. I kept quiet. I hate people arguing.\n\nThe next time was because I refused to do the course that they wanted in favor of my dream course. My mum literally told me that I was stupid and my dad said that I should never ask for help from him after campus for a job because I decided to do a stupid course. In the end, I had to stand my ground, however, I never did my dream course. I remember at that time, I hated that I had passed my high school exams and wished I had gotten a D. It would have made my life easier.\n\nI recently cut off my elder sister because I realized that I hated having undependable people in my life. I always had to jump through hoops trying to live in peace with her while she never tried. To me, I believe she has a victims mentality: she always so absorbed in her trauma that she forgets we all went through the same shit with my parents so she has no right to make it seem like she's the only one who has suffered in life. If I were to recount the amount of body shaming she and my mom put me through to the point I started starving myself, she wouldn't even speak. Not to mention the irreparable damage the did to my self esteem making me think I'm not good enough for anybody. However, I shall not go into depth about my trauma.\n\nNow I'm stuck at home for Christmas with the whole bunch. I've realized that I have never had someone I could truly rely on in my life. I decided that I'll use my computer skills to start earning my own money and move out before end of my fourth year in campus. I considered going to uni abroad but I shut it down: I wasn't in the right frame of mind and I need to sort out my own trauma first as going abroad to me was a means of escaping all of them. I've realized my anxiety attacks are getting worse by the day and it seems that I have developed some sort of high functioning depression. I can't sleep well these days and I've lost interest in stuff I used to enjoy(reading)\n\nI just hate them all so much. I thought  family was supposed to be people you could rely on but it seems like life decided to play a cruel trick on me. My parents priorities are wack: they'd rather spend money build a whole new ass house instead of sending my uni allowance on time. Ironically, my mum will complain that I've lost weight or that I'm too mean with spending money, however, I'm always tempted to tell them that they are the reason why I'm always on edge. I remember asking my mum for money to get new glasses since my old ones were damaged beyond repair and she started calling me irresponsible and high maintenance. I have never in my life broken specs. I just sorted out my finances and used my savings to buy newer ones. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Funnily enough, they bought a new car at the time. They also missed my high school prayer day and went for their friends' party. The painful part of this is that somehow, I'm the only one they do this to.\n\nSorry for the rant. I'm just tired of it all. I hope that I'll somehow manage to escape this, however, I don't think I can continue on for so long. I'm already tired and I don't have the will nor the strength to live on. So far, I only have one tether on this earth making me not end it, and I don't think I can do it anymore.\n\nAny advice would help", "created_utc": 1703573749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r28he/aita_to_dislike_my_family/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
