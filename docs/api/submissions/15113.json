Everyone involved is 20s-30s.\n\n Last Christmas my wife and I threw a Christmas party. A friend of mine I\u2019ve known half my life, R, asked the day before if he could invite a few friends, which we thought was a bit inconvenient but agreed. One of these friends, M, brought a little boy with her, could not have been much older than 5. This was not a party for children and I wished someone would have told me first a child would be coming for my wife and I would have advised against it. \n\n At the party, M\u2019s son played up a lot, and at one point was having a full on tantrum while M was in the bathroom. I tried to calm him down, showing him some pictures of our dog we had on our fridge, and when M came back she was very grateful. She asked me if I had any children and I told her I had a 7yr old. We spoke briefly about our sons and then she and her son went out to the garden, where most of the guests were.\n\n The problem is that in 2021 we lost my son. It was heartbreaking for me and my wife and not something I wanted to divulge to a stranger. My wife and I still consider ourselves parents and I would have thought that me being a parent might have been reassuring for her. \n\n  However, R has since begun dating M and has wanted to introduce her to our friends again. The topic of our Christmas party and our brief exchange in the kitchen came up, when R informed M that my son had been dead for over a year. M now considers me to be a liar and untrustworthy, and is not interested in seeing me again as she thought we had 'bonded' over our sons, and R is annoyed he had to be the one to tell her about my dead son. He has asked me to apologise to M for misleading her, which my wife finds insulting. \n\n On one hand, I do not think I did anything wrong, she was a stranger to me and I doubted I would ever see her again, but I know this is causing tension in their relationship and I do not wish to make R's life worse so I am wondering if I should just apologise to keep them both happy.

You don't owe anyone an explanation or apology -- you are not obligated to divulge the death of your young son to anyone, ever.", "NTA and R is a terrible friend. Sparing you having to be the one to explain that your son is dead should be something he is happy to do, as a supportive friend, honestly. And M? Needs to get over herself and not blame you for anything, her reaction is so cruel. I wonder if she'd told her son about how he'd get to meet your son and now she's mad she has to explain death to him? Wouldn't justify this behaviour, but it might explain it.", "M, the guest of a guest in your home, thinks you're somehow a bad person for not confiding in her, a complete stranger, about what I would imagine is the worst thing that ever happened to you?\n\nM can GTFO.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's completely insane that this is causing tension in their relationship, wow. \n\nI am so, so sorry to hear about your son. Of course you're still considering yourselves parents, you absolutely are and always will be. M clearly has the emotional intelligence/depth of a frog, it sounds like she's someone that would be complaining to R that you'd made her uncomfortable by displaying your grief if you'd told her that your son had passed away. \n\nR needs to get a clue, they should be the ones apologising to you for such nonsensical drama, not the other way around.", "NTA. Good, let it cause tension in their relationship. If R is too thick to see that M's reaction and behavior are way out of line, then he deserves it. R should have shut M down the minute she opened her mouth criticizing you. \n\nYou and your wife experienced every parents nightmare and this dingbat is expecting you to apologize because you didn't feel like bearing your soul to a stranger. She was then and she should remain to you, nothing. \n\nIf this is causing R's life to be \"worse\" so be it. His choice to associate with an emotionally tone deaf woman, that's on him.", "NTA...  A party is not the time or place to discuss something that is so painful.  I get not wanting to go there but still acknowledging your child's existence.  People don't have to tell you their life story the first time you meet them.  I am guessing that she can't read a room because of this and thinking it is ok to bring a child to an adult party.  It takes a while to get to know someone.  That's a good thing, not a suspicious thing. In fact, I am usually leary of people who just put everything out on the table first thing. That's a lot to unpack.  I don't find people like that very interesting.  Now, I don't want people to hide stuff from me either, but there is a big difference.  Maybe just a face to face explanation is warranted but not an apology.", ">He has asked me to apologise to M for misleading her, which my wife finds insulting.  \n   \nNTA  \n1. Your wife is right, it is insulting  \n2. What in the fucking world is wrong with M and R?   \n3. She was a stranger and had no right to the information that you lost your child  \n4. Neither of these people are worth one moment of your time or energy  \n5. Fuck, people are just awful  \n6. If it is causing tension then that's their issue to solve, not yours. Let them figure it out", "NTA, holy shit. Who acts like that?", "NTA. You did what was needed in the moment. Plus, you're still a parent. It's a tragic situation and the other party in question is being dramatic and heartless.", "NTA. You do not owe her an apology. Yes, I understand how that can be misinterpreted, but seriously, who would call you a liar for saying \"you had\" a son and misleading her. You did, and you are still a parent. This is something tragic and you don't owe others an explanation.", "First sorry for your loss.\n\nAnd NTA. It is clear why you wouldn't have told her. She was a stranger. It was a party you would not want to kill the mood. And as you said, you still see yourself as a parent.\n\nMaybe talk to her about that, so she can see your side. But don't appologice for not telling her about the worst thing that has happened to you, after knowing her for a few hours?", "OP you are 100% NTA. I'm so sorry for the loss you and your wife experienced, that is extremely difficult and my heart goes out to you. You definitely did not need to disclose anything to M who was a stranger to you at the time, she wasn't entitled to know that information. Why she feels anything but empathy towards you and your wife is beyond me and shows how terrible her character is. Ron is not also not a good friend to you for going along with her and this ridiculous attitude she has", "NTA \n\nM is an idiot and R is a waste of space.", "Whoa! NTA! Not at all! Definitely NTA!\n\nYou made a perfectly reasonable decision in the circumstances, and the details surrounding your son are nobody's business. If M doesn't understand that - and further thinks that this makes you a liar - then that just reflects poorly on M. I understand R is trying to smooth things over, but R needs to grow up a little bit about this, too.\n\nBut you? You are most certainly NTA.", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong. Your grief is your grief and if you choose to not speak about it, that is your choice. R has no valid reason to be mad at you. I can understand why M might feel a little misled but as a parent, she should understand why you chose to keep that information private, so her reaction is way over the top. You can apologize but honestly, I don't think you have any reason to. Like I said, your grief is your own and it's not for other people to judge you for choosing to keep some things private.", "Most definitely NTA. It was absolute none of her business and at that moment in time you choose to tell her that you had a son. She doesn\u2019t need to know anything more. If anything, R should be annoyed with how M is acting over something that wasn\u2019t her business, nor was it the place or time to discuss something so personal with a stranger!", "NTA. That person has no right to dictate how you grieve. They have no right to the details of your life. It is likely they are either incredibly selfish, or they are incredibly uncomfortable. Either way it\u2019s a them problem.", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong and it's unfair of R or M to make any demands on how you describe your family status or what information you choose to share in this situation.", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss. M is disgusting to think that because you lost your son, you are no longer a parent. \n\nR did not have your back which I frankly think is a betrayal. To be honest with the way you describe them, they are an awful friend anyways. What on Earth do you even have to apologise for?", "NTA. \n\nShe asked if you were a parent. You were. There was absolutely no need at the time to delve into the details of your child's death. You weren't misleading her.\n\nAlso, R needs to not invite a bunch of people to someone else's Christmas party, especially not without asking first or making sure that it's okay to bring children. R is kind of a shitty friend in that regard, as well as in terms of the whole son situation.", "NTA. The person accusing you of lying is a fucking garbage can. You weren't lying about having a son. You are parents. Fuck that weirdo dude I'm so sorry. Ew that pissed me off. \ud83d\ude24", "NTA.  It's mad that she thinks you owe her any kind of apology.", "You literally said you \"had\" a son. Sorry for your loss, nta", "NTA\n\nYou dont need to be friends with someone who gets mad at you when they find out your son has passed. I'm also not really sure what she was expecting you to say while at a party, you are still a parent and it seems like you rightly felt that this was not the time or place to reveal a great loss to what seems like a casual friend.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss. He's always going to be your son and you will always be his parents. It's not something you just announce to strangers in your home at a Christmas party, especially when another child is around. You don't owe anyone an apology or an explanation. It wasn't R's place to even bring that up. He could've just texted and said \"M wants to organize a playdate, what should I tell her?\".", "NTA - you didn\u2019t lie. You didn\u2019t tell the entire story of your life to a person you just met.", "NTA, please cut both from your life. You do not need these type of people in your life. \n\nPlease accept my deepest sympathies.", "NTA. . . If i were in M's position these would be my thoughts..\n1.Oh, OP didnt mention that. I wonder if they're still processing their grief. \n2.Maybe OP didnt want to tell someone they just met something that painful\n3. Its none of my business why OP didn't want to tell me that. \n...\nNOT\n1. OPs a liar and untrustworthy\n2. OPs child has passed and therefore OPs experiences that bonded us are no longer valid \n3. I demand an apology from OP and now have tension in my relationship with R. \n\nObjectively speaking You don't owe anything to M or R - they're adults and their relationship doesn't depend on how you choose to disclose something as sensitive as your child's passing. Grief should be respected, and as much as M isn't understanding that R should've stepped in and defended their friend they've known 1/2 their lives. Again NTA.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.  \n\nHaving said that, just because your son has passed on does not mean you no longer have a son.", "NTA and it was super awesome of you to try and calm her un-announced son down during your adult hangout.\n\nI'm really sorry ablout your son, OP.\n\n'M' seems very shallow and immature.", "You have nothing to apologize for and should be expecting apologies from both R and M for being giant jerks on multiple fronts.  You didn't and still don't owe M any kind of explanation.  R isn't looking great in this picture as a friend either.  Horning in on your Christmas party.  Bringing kids without discussing it with you.  Getting annoyed about anything in this situation.  And not straightening things out with M without involving you at all.  In it's totality this is not a shining series of events on the friend front. NTA.", "NTA: This is crazy. You don't owe your life history to a stranger. These folks are ... ???...", "NTA. Please stop being friends with \"R\" for the next half of your life. You and your wife deserve better friends than that.", "NTA and I don't believe you should give any apologies, your wife is correct in thinking it is insulting.  \n\nIt is very understandable that you did not want to discuss your child's passing to a stranger at a party and there is no need to not acknowledge your child's existence. I cannot fathom why this person would think they are owed an apology or why it would cause tension in their relationship when you are not apart of that relationship. Also, I don't know why your friend is mad that he had to tell his own partner about his own friend's situation. It makes more sense that he did and not you having to do it. \n\nThese people sound rude, inviting more guests to your party and bringing a child without checking first. \n\nPlease do not apologize. Only you get to decide who you want to talk about painful subjects with. Their relationship is their own problem.", "Time to cut R out anyway. If you're not the host, you don't invite people to the party beyond an extended +1, NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to apologize for anything! Both your friend & his girlfriend are assholes. Him, for not telling his gf to back off. The gf because she's a petty, inconsiderate, insignificant to your lives b&#[\u00d7.", "NTA - R is.  While yes it would have made sense for you to clarify that while you have a 7 year, he passed away and so you\u2019re not exactly going through the same day to day as she is.  I do think even hearing that your son passed away would be more comforting for her in valuing what she has with her son.\n\nHowever, your friend R is the real issue in not being understanding, and when this woman not being understanding, that you may not want to tell everyone your son passed away and that while you understand being a parent it IS different circumstances, but ya do get a bit of a pass here as you have in fact experienced a worst nightmare situation so for them to hold onto this anger is disappointing.", "NTA, you're not a liar.  You're still a parent.  That woman is ridiculous and your friend is an ah.", "I'm sorry that I did not share a painful fact about my son being dead in our two minute conversation.  How entitled.  NTA.", "NTA.  R is the A times at least three.  1) for not warning you about bringing a kid to the party and asking for permission specifically for a kid, 2) for not telling her you had a deceased child, 3) for expecting you to explain that to someone you just met.  I would tell R the above and until they both apologize to you, they are not welcome at your house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly, I wish they had not been talking about my family at all. \n\n I had not considered that. It is possible. I have not been told they were planning to have the boy meet up with us again, but they did not mention that he would be attending last time either, so I suppose I cannot rule it out.

Even if one of her friends had lied to me, I cannot see myself ever taking it out on her and our relationship, especially if it was something that did not affect me directly.\n\nThank you so much. I honestly worried that if I had talked to a stranger about my dead son, it would just make it uncomfortable, and I had hoped me being a parent would have made her feel a bit better about her son's tantrums, even if my wife and I did not want kids at this party we've all been there when our kids cause tension and it is never easy.\n\nThank you for your comment!", " I had hoped that by telling her I was also a parent it would help a bit, whether we wanted her son there or not every parent has been in the situation where your kid is having a public meltdown so I had wanted to hopefully make her feel better about it. It sounds like the event was described to her properly, so why she thought it appropriate to bring him I do not know, she and the friends she came with, like the rest of us, were drinking quite a bit so I hope they took a taxi back. I agree with you there, if people started telling me the worst things that ever happened to them when I first met them I would be concerned. \n\nPerhaps.

Totally on R and M.", "Thank you. I have definitely done that before - with the person's permission of course - so my wife does not say something that may accidentally upset someone", "Most of us have warned him before that this is frustrating, but he seems to forget. Sometimes there is more time in advance, but for me he told me the day before, which was rather inconvenient. People have said no before, but that just made it more stressful. I think he generally does it to avoid having clashing plans rather than just doing what he wants, but most of us would prefer he just choose which friends to spend his time with rather than bringing strangers to our homes", "Needs to not invite R over ever again.

As far as she knows, you have a son.

He of course had no obligation to tell me, a stranger, about what actually happened, so I suppose he figured that was the easiest thing for him to say in that moment.'

She'd quickly find the truth from someone else one way or another, and it would be better coming from you rather than someone else after you misled her into believing the opposite was true. What's she going to do with that information which would make your life worse in any way? \n\nI just don't understand this need people have to keep all personal details of their life under the utmost secrecy. If you told her 'I did have a son, but he passed away; we don't really want to talk about it' then do you really think that just because she's a ~stranger~ she'd be anything less than sympathetic and understanding?", "NTA M should apologise to you for her (unintentional) insensitivity.

And what kind of nut job is M to come up with such a ridiculous complaint as thinking you bonded over a minimal response and now considers you a liar and untrustworthy. A normal response to learning this kind of information would be \"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry, how difficult this must be for these people.\" R and M are both clueless. Perhaps you and your wife would be better off without these two in your life. Oh, and last, but not least, if R was really a good friend with any sense and compassion, maybe it would have dawned on him that bringing a child around the same age as the child you lost to a party in your home, might not be a very considerate move. A year is not that long after losing a child.

I was not trying to get to know her nor did I want to talk about my life with her, and i certainly did not expect to ever see her again.

She was not dating my friend at the time and I had no intention of inviting her over again.\n\nI also disagree that I was 'outright lying'. I do have a son. I am a parent. That is not a lie just because he is not here anymore", "I still don't know why she brought her son to an obviously adult party, it was at my house so it is not like there would be anyone there to watch any children attending.

Instead of expressing empathy for the deep pain you would feel about your loss and how hard it would be for you to discuss it, she instead chose to make it about her.

They only knew two of my brothers as my sister lives over 8 hours away, they knew of her just not her.", "I lost my son in 2021. Fuck what anyone says! No. You are still a parent. You still have a son. Apologies? He'll no!", "NTA - I really think this \"friendship\" has run its course.", "Parents feel the visceral gut punch of the mere thought of losing a child. They don\u2019t think \u201cthey lied!\u201d That\u2019s an immature and self centered thought process", "Sounds like the woman who is demanding an apology feels like an asshole and is embarrassed. Instead of being an adult and acknowledging that it is none of her business, she\u2019s making it about her feelings so you feel like an asshole. \n\nFuck these people. You don\u2019t owe anyone an apology. Wtf!?", "I\u2019m not sure you were wrong to say you had a son who is 7. You do. But if you were, parents who lose a child get a free pass for just about anything in my book. They\u2019re AHs for bringing this up to you. \n\nSorry for your loss.", "That is recent. Two years is still very fresh in the grief continuum.", "Also, it\u2019s not like your dad\u2019s having died means you don\u2019t have a dad anymore. The same goes with a child, you DO have a son. I don\u2019t understand where the \u201clie\u201d is. What a totally bizarre thing to get upset about. I absolutely would not consider apologizing to anyone.", "wth NTA NTA NTA. \n\nwho is she to tell you you don't have a son?\nIs she erasing the fact you ever had a son? What's wrong with her?\n\nI really find her remark offensive.\n\nDon't go back on your word. If your friend can't support you, then f*ck it. Don't ever apologize for still being a dad to your dear son.", "Nta. So very sorry about your son.", "NTA and sorry for your loss \ud83d\ude22", "Uhhhhhh. Wow..nta but do you even want to be friends with her?", "\"I'm wondering if I should apologise\" - Should you fuck.\n\nI cannot believe that a 'friend' and some hanger on actually want you to apologise, essentially, for your son dying and having the temerity to still consider him your son. What kind of sickos are they? That is an appalling attitude.\n\nI could not imagine being so entitled as to be offended by such a situation. Where is their concern, their sympathy, their understanding, insofar as that is possible?\n\nI would forget about M and seriously reconsider my relationship with matey. Any true friend would have been on your side without question and told fragile 'M' to wind her fucking neck in or sling her hook.\n\nNTA. Don't say a single word to them.", "Yup. I don't have kids so can't POSSIBLY imagine the pain of losing one. But I would, in a heartbeat, run that gauntlet for a stranger, let alone a friend.", "At a party no less. That OP was hosting and at which she was a guest. While he was fresh from having comforted her tantrum-ing child at a party that was never intended for children. As a mom myself, I can\u2019t fathom any of her entitlement or lack of empathy either. \n\nAnd babbyjgraham, I\u2019m so sorry you can relate to OP\u2019s post\u2026 my heart aches for you both and I\u2019m honored that you both chose to share your experiences with us to bear witness in your mutual pursuit of healing, and supporting one another. May life bless you with all the support and non-judgment this world has to offer, sending huge tender virtual hugs\u2026"]}
