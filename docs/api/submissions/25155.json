Some feelings are just expected of kids. No need to make it a huge & dramatic deal especially when you know where their envy comes from; wanting to be like her older sister. Your parents have tried to stay neutral because this is to be expected of young ones. \n\nWhen you snapped at her, she cried even more probably because she felt like her own role model poured acid on her already sore, jealous heart.\n\nMaybe you could have talked to her softly, let her know that her turn would come soon the same way you & your parents have all waited to graduate?\nYou could have inspired her to rise above her feelings of envy for you, turning it into a healthy motivation to graduate and do well. \n\nI mean, what kind of older sibling wouldn\u2019t want the rest to grow up to be even better than they did?\nYTA", "NTA.

Cause if your sister is this bad at 15, and this trend isn\u2019t corrected, she\u2019s gonna turn into something far worse as time goes on. Be careful.\n\n\nEdit: Also, PS- Good job graduating!

Just from the brief details here, I get the impression he's annoyed that your sister is fussing, and he is putting the onus on you (as the more level headed and reasonable sibling) to make it all go away for his own convenience. His desire for a surface-level peaceful house in the short term is ultimately just shooting himself in the foot. He's enabling your sister to avoid building a healthy skillset for emotional regulation (which will ultimately just create more future tantrums), and he's causing permanent damage to his relationship to you by demonstrating himself as a non-trustworthy parental figure. Ultimately, he's doing right by neither of you.", "Pure nightmare fuel", "Here's what I don't get:  u/discountslim69 has a mom with her head screwed on straight,  a drama Llama sister, and enabler father.

I'd probably have invited the neighbor's dog before inviting a sister like yours.", "Was there really a choice? I\u2019m betting that sister demanded a ticket or one of them thought that she should have it and then OP got to choose which parent (if sis didn\u2019t take after dad in the first place and demand a seat). Mom not going was probably an attempt to keep tantrums at bay and insure good behavior from sister. Or because she\u2019s just that entitled.", "> She got 2 tickets to graduation\n\nIt's a bit confusing, but it looks to me like OP graduated from a Catholic HS, and as part of the event, there was a mass before the ceremony for which she got two tickets.

I doubt OP would have invited the sister if both parents were able to attend", "You're correct. Your graduation day is suppose to be all about you, just like college graduation and your wedding if you ever get married. Those are definitely 3 days that can be all about you. When your sister does graduate then she will be the center of attention as well. Definitely NTA. You dad needs to stop enabling her selfishness.", "Crying is a manipulation technique which works sometimes.   She wants to be the bride at every wedding and the princess at every party.  MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!", "NTA but the people insulting your sister as attention seeking and drama queen are missing that it sounds like your success has triggered her own low self esteem and low self worth, feeling stupid and like a failure. This is not to say it's your fault - it's not - and yes as a teenage girl her reaction may be outsized or immature! But it sounds like she could use some love and reassurance from her family in general. Best wishes OP and congrats on graduating!", "Why not offer to help your sister so she can earn a diploma, too.", "NTA, it's selfish of her to sulk at the dinner that celebrated your achievement, you're right. However, maybe there's a deeper issue here of her being insecure about her own intelligence compared to yours from her reaction of crying and saying she won't graduate because she's \"stupid\", and she's not dealing with it in a healthy way and just lashing out. Your parents should talk with her about her calling herself stupid and her feelings about that and find a way to resolve these feelings in a healthy way, or else these problems will continue to negatively affect you AND her. You were not wrong though to point out to her that she was behaving selfishly and explaining how it affects you, I don't think you need to apologize.", "NTA.  So your sister sulked during your graduation, skipped the actual ceremony and when you called her out on it, she called you every name in the book and your dad expects YOU to apologize? Will sister be required to apologize for her behavior?", "NTA.  Tell dad we know who the favorite is.  You will not apologize for her being a brat!", "NTA and tell dad this is EXACTLY your point.", "NTA\n\nBut, is your Dad at least aware of this issue? From what you're saying, this sounds like it's about attention in general.\n\nShe may be able to get away with it to some extent because of High School, but her life after graduation won't be a good one if this isn't nipped in the bud. This kind of trait will quickly create toxic relationships and ruin opportunities for her.\n\nYour sister might need therapy for this. I say might because I know both sides of the coin and this is a reddit post. It's only one viewpoint of your life. A person can have an issue that makes them attention seeking and can get better with help. A person might also need to be taught that everything doesn't revolve around them. In both scenarios, a person can only change if they want to do so.\n\nMy cousin, Melanie, pulled this behavior with her younger sister, Cheryl in their teens. Melanie? Therapy confirmed that she had no issues. She just wanted attention. The parents did their job and parented. They spoke to Melanie and told her that her emotions (like being upset) were valid but there was a time and a place. She could feel what she felt, but that didn't excuse responsibility or excuse any damage.\n\nLike, Melanie would cry and then her parents would move her to another room and she'd 'magically' feel better.\n\nMelanie could be a good person and had good traits. She was just such an attention seeker when it came to Cheryl that the single trait poisoned relationships. One family reunion was so annoying that I had to tell Melanie that she was going to leave Cheryl alone. I didn't ask. I told her. It took policing her to get her to stop.", "Your dad is an asshole along with your sister", "NTA\n\nDooooon\u2019t apologize!!

My mom agrees with me in my stance", "I don\u2019t even care at this point that she\u2019s been horrible to me since she was 5, but the fact that she\u2019s awful to my kids makes me want to commit acts of violence. If it wasn\u2019t that she shows up for my grandparents I wouldn\u2019t go if she\u2019s going to be there. Dad\u2019s getting remarried soon, so not looking forward to seeing her there. I really like his fianc\u00e9e so if she makes her cry on their wedding day, I might just have to finally give into the urge to yank out her extensions and act one of those crazy ladies from Jerry Springer; away from the wedding of course."]}
