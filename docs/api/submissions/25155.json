Best wishes OP and congrats on graduating!", "Why not offer to help your sister so she can earn a diploma, too.", "NTA, it's selfish of her to sulk at the dinner that celebrated your achievement, you're right. However, maybe there's a deeper issue here of her being insecure about her own intelligence compared to yours from her reaction of crying and saying she won't graduate because she's \"stupid\", and she's not dealing with it in a healthy way and just lashing out. Your parents should talk with her about her calling herself stupid and her feelings about that and find a way to resolve these feelings in a healthy way, or else these problems will continue to negatively affect you AND her. You were not wrong though to point out to her that she was behaving selfishly and explaining how it affects you, I don't think you need to apologize.", "NTA.  So your sister sulked during your graduation, skipped the actual ceremony and when you called her out on it, she called you every name in the book and your dad expects YOU to apologize? Will sister be required to apologize for her behavior?", "NTA.  Tell dad we know who the favorite is.  You will not apologize for her being a brat!", "NTA and tell dad this is EXACTLY your point.", "NTA\n\nBut, is your Dad at least aware of this issue? From what you're saying, this sounds like it's about attention in general.\n\nShe may be able to get away with it to some extent because of High School, but her life after graduation won't be a good one if this isn't nipped in the bud. This kind of trait will quickly create toxic relationships and ruin opportunities for her.\n\nYour sister might need therapy for this. I say might because I know both sides of the coin and this is a reddit post. It's only one viewpoint of your life. A person can have an issue that makes them attention seeking and can get better with help. A person might also need to be taught that everything doesn't revolve around them. In both scenarios, a person can only change if they want to do so.\n\nMy cousin, Melanie, pulled this behavior with her younger sister, Cheryl in their teens. Melanie? Therapy confirmed that she had no issues. She just wanted attention. The parents did their job and parented. They spoke to Melanie and told her that her emotions (like being upset) were valid but there was a time and a place. She could feel what she felt, but that didn't excuse responsibility or excuse any damage.\n\nLike, Melanie would cry and then her parents would move her to another room and she'd 'magically' feel better.\n\nMelanie could be a good person and had good traits. She was just such an attention seeker when it came to Cheryl that the single trait poisoned relationships. One family reunion was so annoying that I had to tell Melanie that she was going to leave Cheryl alone. I didn't ask. I told her. It took policing her to get her to stop.", "Your dad is an asshole along with your sister", "NTA\n\nDooooon\u2019t apologize!!

My mom agrees with me in my stance", "I don\u2019t even care at this point that she\u2019s been horrible to me since she was 5, but the fact that she\u2019s awful to my kids makes me want to commit acts of violence.

I really like his fianc\u00e9e so if she makes her cry on their wedding day, I might just have to finally give into the urge to yank out her extensions and act one of those crazy ladies from Jerry Springer; away from the wedding of course.", "NTA at all, but are you the first person in your family (whole family including parents etc) to graduate high school? It strikes me as a bit unusual that it's being heavily talked up, seemingly over a number of weeks, as a big achievement and thirteen years of work. I'm not saying that's at all inaccurate, it actually is a big achievement and you're right to be proud of it - but it's not how the occasion tends to be marked in families where finishing high school is just normal, and neither is a regular 15yo thinking she's too stupid to finish school. \n\nIf you are from a family of intergenerational disadvantage and as a result the first person in your family to finish school, this is way more complex than you realise. What I suspect you're describing is a family starting to shift social classes. That's a good thing overall, but it's a complex thing. If, as I suspect, your parents are only fairly newly financially comfortable and have made a priority of your schooling because they didn't have it, your sister may be fighting feelings of insecurity about whether she \"really fits in.\" Rising from disadvantage to advantage has many painful transition moments, for some more than others. I'm not saying you have to put up with your sister's shit; she is old enough to learn not to make her feelings other people's problem. But I'd like you to consider that she may be grappling with things that you don't fully understand, she might not just be the garden-variety jerk that she appears.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA - okay, now that we cleared that up, let\u2019s talk about family dynamics for a minute. \n\nFirst, you are child so these issues are not only not your fault but they are not your responsibility. I\u2019m telling you this for your own personal understanding and possibly to help you navigate situations in the future. Again *not* because you have any responsibility to do something. \n\nNo matter what your experience is in your family and how similar you think your upbringing was every child has a very different experience. Parents do not parent their children exactly the same. Partly because the kids are not the same and also because the parents are not the same. These things do not remain static. We would all fair a lot better if we could understand this and accept it. \n\n Your parents should genuinely consider counseling/therapy for your sister. I know because she\u2019s behaving selfishly and it\u2019s negatively impacting you? You may not be the best person to tell them this but she is trying to cope with some serious feeling of inadequacy and someone needs to get at the root of that for her and help her figure out how to process it. It will make a huge difference for the rest of her life, not just your relationship with her.", "Your dad is enabling her tantrums. He should have told her to knock it off every time. You didn\u2019t hurt her feelings, she made a scene so she could get attention.

You pretty much bounce from one person to the next.", "And what about all the things she said to you?!", "To be say no. Tell your dad all the reasons his request is wrong. You will not enable or excuse your sister\u2019s atrocious behavior and he should stop doing that too. She was the AH multiple times. She called you every name in the book. All you did was graduate and celebrate your accomplishment. Her turn isn\u2019t for a few more years. She\u2019s acting like a spoiled toddler. You will not help him encourage her bad behavior and therefore will not be apologizing for calling her out- accurately- on her own behavior. She\u2019s the one who owes an apology. And frankly, so do your parents for not putting a stop to her tantrums ages ago. Your parents need to actually try parenting.\n\nNTA", "Or mom worked that day", "NTA and holy cow, my 3-year-old nephew would act better than her", "NTA Bet daddy dearest is the root cause of your sister's horrid behavior.", "NTA, and I'd tell your dad that you'll apologize whenever your sister feels the need to apologize to you for always interfering and ruining your special moments.\n\nShe's 15 years old, not 2 anymore.\n\nYour mom sounds awesome at least!", "NTA - attention seekers eventually find out that their attention seeking also draws in negative attention.", "NTA \n\nShe needs therapy asap", "NTA", "NTA your sister needs help and is in for the rudest awakening of her life\u2026", "NTA.\n\n\nCongrats on your graduation. I would do your best to extend grace to your sister, as much as you\u2019re comfortable doing. It sounds like she\u2019s struggling with some self-doubt and complicated feelings; that doesn\u2019t excuse her bad behavior, but I also would advise trying to patch things over when you\u2019re ready to. You deserve to celebrate your achievement, but it sounds like she could use some support as well.", "What is WITH these fucked up family dynamics?!  NO, you don\u2019t owe your sister an apology!  Where\u2019s HER apology for calling you every name in the book??? She sounds unhinged. \n\nDEFINITELY NTA", "NTA. Tell her she doesn't have any feelings, they are imaginary. She has actions and they are showing her character.", "lmao this is how you know as a kid you ain\u2019t get disciplined by your parents. younger sister sounds entitled af. NTA for snapping it\u2019s valid. she\u2019s young still so hopefully your parents can still correct her behaviour. It was your special day and she made it all about herself. she\u2019s going to realize later on in life that not everything is about herself.", "Unpopular position here- ESA. What is the big deal about graduating high school? It\u2019s the minimum achievement for any future success", "That's good. A lot of kids who struggle to get good grades do well because they learn a strong work ethic and good work habits. Keep telling your sister that she can do it, too.", "Maybe Mom isn't Catholic. I love my siblings, but I wouldn't go to mass for them."]}
