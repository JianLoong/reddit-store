The world outside won't have her BS like daddy does. \n\nMove out as soon as you can- and all the best for your future!", "My dad wants me to apologize to her because I hurt her feelings with what I said to her", "eh I wouldn't say move out ASAP. she doesn't live in a hell hole. her mother is siding with her so there's that. her sister just needs a serious wake up call or at least both of her parents to stop coddling her so much when she acts like this. this behavior won't cut it when she's out of high school", "My point is, she said some things to you which hurt your feelings. Why are her hurt feelings more important than yours?\n\nIf only one person is being asked to apologise, then your father isn't treating you equally.", "I said move out because concentrating on work/studies becomes extremely difficult if you have a sibling who's like this. I have seen a friend go through this- but it's completely OP's call to decide their tolerance levels", "NTA", "NTA\n\nStart crying that you have hurt feelings because your sister has hurt feelings and demand that she apologizes to you for hurting your feelings. \n\nAnd then ask your dad to apologize for hurting your feelings by telling you off for your sisters hurt feelings. \n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to cry the whole time - ugly cry and gasping for air is the best", "YTA", "Your sister is an AH. She seems like an attention seeker.", "NTA CONGRATS! What you said wasn\u2019t even harsh. Your sister needs to grow out of that attention seeking habit real quick, not everyone is going to be a nice as you were. Cause me personally, I would\u2019ve gave her a real reason to cry about what I said.", "NTA. Only way you could/should say sorry to your sister would be if you used it as a teachable moment, and used it to reinforce the fact that not every moment needs to be about her.", "Tell your dad he should advise her to stop crying and put some effort into learning and having a good behavior in class/twords the teachers. \n\nTHAT'S gonna help her graduate .

I\u2019m actually dreading my wedding because I don\u2019t trust her not to pull some bullish", "I think YTA (softly). \nIn all aspects, I think it\u2019s fine that you feel annoyed from her centrism. The dinner situation was a perfect scenario to work with when I was trying to understand the dynamic between you two. Your little sister is obviously just jealous of her older sister\u2019s accomplishment & attention which seems so far away to her.\n\nThat\u2019s what little siblings do, they get jealous, they wanna be like their role models who came just a little bit before them.\nI think there was a better way to handle the situation in the car, like the adults at dinner did. Some feelings are just expected of kids. No need to make it a huge & dramatic deal especially when you know where their envy comes from; wanting to be like her older sister. Your parents have tried to stay neutral because this is to be expected of young ones. \n\nWhen you snapped at her, she cried even more probably because she felt like her own role model poured acid on her already sore, jealous heart.\n\nMaybe you could have talked to her softly, let her know that her turn would come soon the same way you & your parents have all waited to graduate?\nYou could have inspired her to rise above her feelings of envy for you, turning it into a healthy motivation to graduate and do well. \n\nI mean, what kind of older sibling wouldn\u2019t want the rest to grow up to be even better than they did?\nYTA", "NTA. To me it feels like being the baby and the only girl she is entitled to be treated like the princess she is, your dad either doesn't want his daughter to be upset or doesn't want to be drama and just wants quiet.\nTbh your sister does sound like she is becoming an entitled spoiled brat probably due to what I stated above. OP it's YOUR day to celebrate in a couple of years it will be her day to celebrate", "NTA, she owes you an apology", "NTA. You should have asked both your parents to go to your graduation originally too I think. How come you didn't ask your mom to go?", "Nta but your dad is", "NTA. Your father likes her more than you.", "You're expecting quite a bit difference in emotional responsibility with only a two year age difference.", "15 is way too old to throw a tantrum because someone else achieved something", "Sister is probably a sophomore at this point, she\u2019s way too old to be throwing temper tantrums over not being the center of attention. There\u2019s only a two year difference between her and op, why are you talking about her as if she\u2019s a 5 year old who can\u2019t regulate their emotions?", "I presume your father had nothing to say when she missed mass or about her tantrum and pouting afterwards."]}
