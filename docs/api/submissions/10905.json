Many people choose to focus on the cost of the gift rather than the thought behind it. Your wife seems like one of those people.

She said you didn\u2019t spend enough money and then stopped you from spending more money? I would leave the gift getting to her next time.", "NTA. As you said you were smart in your purchase. That doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA Your wife is being absurd.", "NTA\n\nIf you got a good deal on a nice gift, that\u2019s awesome!

You got a nice gift for him, so there\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. However, your wife wanted to spend $75-$100 as the value of gift and to some extent you ignored that. \n\nStores have all kinds of strategies around sales and discounts - so the price you actually pay is the best estimate of the value of the item, not MSRP which is just another marketing tool. If you spent $50, the value of your gift was $50 and not $75-$100. \n\nThere\u2019s hardly a day you can walk into Gap that the entire store isn\u2019t 40% off, so are the items really worth their full price? To me this is the similar.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you got nice gifts at a great price.  Her wanting to spend that much is just arbitrary.", "NTA.  Your wife has a seriously fouled up sense of values.  It's not about the cost, it's about the thought that went into the gift.  You bought him items that he will like/use.  Many people buy gifts on sale.  That's why Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday exist.\n\nBF and I were together 28 years before he passed away.  He heard me say, early on, that buying a dozen red roses for Valentines Day was a waste of money because they didn't last long enough.  Instead, for significant events, he bought me rose bushes.  He tended to buy pink ones because those are my favorites.  We had the fun of planting them together.  We took care of them together so the bloomed for months at a time and smelled great.  I lost him in 2019, but I have my rose garden.  Did one rose bush cost as much as a dozen roses?  Nope, but value them a lot more than I would have valued a dozen cut roses from a shop.  It's the thought that counts, not the cost.", "> Then she flipped out and said I was being insane and ridiculous\n\nPretty sure we're missing a whole lot of INFO.\n\nShe wanted to spend $75-$100, so just spend that, dunno what the issue is here.", "NTA\n\n> said I was cheap\n\nNo, the **_shirts_ were**! \n\nCalling a person cheap means they're making *decisions* based on saving money.

The way your wife maybe should be looking at it is you were probably able to get him much more with the stuff being marked down than what you would have if it was full price. So even though it may seem cheap, you actually got a damn good bargain and more presents for him.", "NTA. You make sense to me, your wife doesn't.", "NTA. Leave her.", "NTA. You guys did get some nice gifts. I honestly don't think your BIL would care that it was marked down. He'd still be excited. I think your wife is just overthinking it.", "NTA. Also, her gift giving logic is massively flawed. Idgaf how much is spent on me, nor do I care the quantity. I do care about the quality and I mostly care if the gift is given with my needs and desires in mind. Like, my in-laws got me an expensive ski package as a gift once, lessons all that jazz, because they love skiing and knew I have never gone because I grew up really poor. However, once they realized that I don\u2019t have health insurance and my middle-aged body and quality of life could be easily ruined by falling down a mountain, they graciously refunded that gift for snowshoes and a new camera (both things they know I love and am also not remotely fearful of, unlike barreling down the side of a mountain). Another time, they got me art supplies that I had mentioned needing more of, and some really nice cozy slippers \u201cbecause you had mentioned you have a circulatory disorder and your feet get really cold\u201d: not an expensive gift at all, but it was with my needs (blood circulation) and desires (I\u2019m an artist) in mind.", "Unless you're going to stand there and tell the brother-in-law the price of each gift, what the hell difference does it make how much you spent?", "NTA.

The shorts cost $65, and each shirt costs $20, so the total is $105. That they were on sale is irrelevant.", "NTA, your wife is really not the brightest if she really believes that you saving a little means you're not fulfilling the gift standard.", "Thank you.", "That's what caught me too. If you spend $100 on crap, that's a terrible purchase and a terrible gift. If you spend $20 on something amazing that the person will love, that's a great deal and a great gift. I would understand if it was the difference between a $20 gift card and a $100 gift card or something, but yeah, NTA here.", "Well because no thought goes into that! Lol. Thanks. Maybe I can do a gift card to a fly fishing store, that\u2019s a major hobby of his.", "Thank you!", "OP wasn't even being frugal tbh. He just got lucky with deals, because 2 tshirts and a pair of shorts are enough for a gift.

However, the same shorts are on Dicks, Kohls, Amazon, etc are selling at MSRP. thanks!", "Sorry, maybe I should edit the post to include more detail there. Yes, I said to her that I would go back into the store and get another gift, no problem. She did the whole guilt trip \u201cno it\u2019s fine\u201d thing. But she said what she said already, made me feel like I was being cheap for getting things on sale. I knew how she really felt, so the \u201cno it\u2019s fine\u201d made me feel worse. When I insisted, she then got upset and said I was being insane and ridiculous for insisting on going to get another gift.", "Well, no, I did know that the shorts were marked down. It was on the tag 65.00 MSRP, with an orange sticker with the sale price. And I did know that buying 2 Tees would save you $5. What I didn\u2019t know was they would give me an additional 20% off if I signed up for emails. That I found out at the register.", "No, small family. However, her family is absolutely insane about gift giving. Growing up, my in laws made sure my wife and her brother would have the same exact amount of gifts, and the approx. same amount spent. My BIL had expensive hobbies growing up, so my wife would have endless gifts to open on Christmas.

You did nothing wrong and herb trying to make you feel guilty about it is disgusting", "I wonder if OP\u2019s wife fixated on a price because BIL had spent a similar amount on a gift for her/OP/both of them, and felt that they needed to spend an equal amount, or they weren\u2019t doing enough to even the scales?  I can wrap my head around that logic, but it totally ignores the sentimental value of a gift, which imo counts for far more than the actual cost.", "So how does she know what your BIL spends on you? Maybe he got your gift on sale too...", "But how would she know how much her BIL spent unless it was a gift card?", "But he's not going to know you got lucky with the sale price? I apologize but I read your post twice and all your comments and I have no idea what your wife is doing. NTA.", "Unless an item is very unusual, it\u2019s pretty normal to be able to estimate a ball-park price. That\u2019s the whole premise of the Price is Right show. Say you received a 55 inch flat screen TV as a gift - they maybe spent $400-$700 or so, depending on the specs. \n\nI\u2019m just speculating here, asking \u201cwhy would a reasonable, rational human do this?\u201d", "Yeah. I totally understand! :-)"]}
