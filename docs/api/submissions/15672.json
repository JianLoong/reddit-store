My wife has bought a dog last year around October time frame even though I told her it wouldn\u2019t be the best choice. I repeatedly laid out to her the reasons why it wouldn\u2019t be good with the main reason being we still had three young kids. A 5 yo girl, a 3 yo boy, and a 1 yo boy. We were neither set financially nor did we have the time to take care of another life. However, she was set on getting the dog. Now, the dog was a rescue from what appears like an abusive background and we became very well aware of it when we got her. I told her there was still time to return the dog because of all the complications that came with her. The dog was very jittery, wouldn\u2019t eat properly, was not potty trained, and all other sorts. She refused to do so in which I finally gave in, but I told her that she better take full responsibility of the dog. Time went by I got attached to the dog, however she was now tired of it. She decided she want to take it back finally when she was taking the dog out for a walk and it ran away from her causing her to fall. I told her no, because she needs to take responsibilities for her actions. Then, she fully committed on taking the dog back as soon as she found out she was pregnant again. She is saying that she could\u2019ve had another miscarriage, because of the dog. I told her no, so she now does not want to take care of the dog and I am left to take responsibility of the dog, because for one I have become attached to her and I don\u2019t want to send her to a shelter for the possibility of her getting put down. So I have been taking care of the dog I only asked her to feed her when I am not home, because I am the only one that works at the moment. However, now that we moved in to a new home she doesn\u2019t want the dog inside and is very insistent on taking her back. The previous house we lived in had a big back yard and protection from the rain. This house does not so I do not want to keep the dog outside. We constantly have fights because of the dog now and she keeps on saying that I am choosing the dog over her and the kids and is apparently jeopardizing the marriage. Which I feel makes no sense since I\u2019m only taking responsibility for her actions. I am trying to prove a point here, because she is like this with other things.

It doesn\u2019t sound like the dog has any worrisome behavior issues with the kids, and though it may not be the best environment, I can\u2019t imagine that rehoming a dog with an abusive past who has made improvements is a good idea for the dog\u2019s well-being either. Seems like it\u2019d give the dog more issues. \n\nPets are a commitment. It would be different if they were a danger to the kids. But your wife knowingly took on this commitment despite warnings and now wants to back out once attachment is stronger with everyone else (I\u2019m assuming the dog is attached to the family at this point and the kids probably have some attachment too). It\u2019s disgusting and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re advocating for the dog here.\n\nIf you do rehome, at least actually find a home instead of a shelter return.

Unfortunately, traumatized animals getting jerked around like mere playthings by families with young children is par for the fucking course. I had to go back and check the ages\u2014I cannot believe you are both 25 years old and this immature. Not sure what\u2019s best for the dog at this point, but it probably isn\u2019t your family.\n\nAlso INFO: How do you expect to afford another child if you knew you couldn\u2019t afford a dog?", "ESH \n\nFor starters, getting the dog in the first place. You both should be mature enough to realize that all adults in the home *must* be on board & committed to adding to the family. Now ik that you seem to at least somewhat understand that, but imho you should've put your foot down, so to speak. I normally wouldn't suggest total inflexibility with couple disputes, but there's a factor that's far far FAR more important here. The innocent, troubled, dependent life that's been affected by your actions/inaction. \n\nIf your wife truly refused to listen to your pleas, & took it upon herself to just bring a dog home anyway, I honestly think that you should've returned her yourself at the first reasonable opportunity. If you gave in & actually *participated* in picking up the dog??

Everything I'm reading here tells me no. \n- The pup is dependent on your wife for the majority of the time. Your wife isn't interested in caring for her, and can't be trusted to do so.\n- Even if said care could be defined by feeding alone (note: it can't), this pup's needs are NOT just those of a normal dog, due to her traumatic past. I suspect I already know the answer, but have either of you taken legitimate steps to address her anxiety issues/rehabilitate her?\n- The pup is being subjected to neglect, & appears to be headed for even worse considering the whole \"not wanting her inside the house\" thing\n\nYou have no choice but to accept that what's best for the dog is absolutely NOT your household. If you truly care about her then you need to put her first, cause at this point the poor thing has just gone from one abusive situation to another. I understand that you got attached to her, but that is *your fault*. Don't get me wrong, I know firsthand how very difficult it is to let go of a critter family member. But that's a hardship that lands on YOUR shoulders, cause it sure as shit should not be her paying the price for your mistakes. Your feelings can't and don't change the reality of the situation. I think (or at least hope) you know that deep down.\n\nI'll reiterate at this point that it is unbelievably wrong, cruel, and probably not even effective anyway, to use a living being for the purpose of \"making a point\". Your issues with your wife must be dealt with SEPARATELY in a way that doesn't cause harm to an innocent victim. \n\n\nTLDR \n\nYour wife has been the AH, I mean, basically every last step of the way here. YTA for letting this go on so long at the expense of the pup, & for thinking it's okay to use her as a lesson.
