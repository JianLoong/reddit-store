My wife has bought a dog last year around October time frame even though I told her it wouldn\u2019t be the best choice. I repeatedly laid out to her the reasons why it wouldn\u2019t be good with the main reason being we still had three young kids. A 5 yo girl, a 3 yo boy, and a 1 yo boy. We were neither set financially nor did we have the time to take care of another life. However, she was set on getting the dog. Now, the dog was a rescue from what appears like an abusive background and we became very well aware of it when we got her. I told her there was still time to return the dog because of all the complications that came with her. The dog was very jittery, wouldn\u2019t eat properly, was not potty trained, and all other sorts. She refused to do so in which I finally gave in, but I told her that she better take full responsibility of the dog. Time went by I got attached to the dog, however she was now tired of it. She decided she want to take it back finally when she was taking the dog out for a walk and it ran away from her causing her to fall. I told her no, because she needs to take responsibilities for her actions. Then, she fully committed on taking the dog back as soon as she found out she was pregnant again. She is saying that she could\u2019ve had another miscarriage, because of the dog. I told her no, so she now does not want to take care of the dog and I am left to take responsibility of the dog, because for one I have become attached to her and I don\u2019t want to send her to a shelter for the possibility of her getting put down. So I have been taking care of the dog I only asked her to feed her when I am not home, because I am the only one that works at the moment. However, now that we moved in to a new home she doesn\u2019t want the dog inside and is very insistent on taking her back. The previous house we lived in had a big back yard and protection from the rain. This house does not so I do not want to keep the dog outside. We constantly have fights because of the dog now and she keeps on saying that I am choosing the dog over her and the kids and is apparently jeopardizing the marriage. Which I feel makes no sense since I\u2019m only taking responsibility for her actions. I am trying to prove a point here, because she is like this with other things.
