My wife has bought a dog last year around October time frame even though I told her it wouldn\u2019t be the best choice. I repeatedly laid out to her the reasons why it wouldn\u2019t be good with the main reason being we still had three young kids. A 5 yo girl, a 3 yo boy, and a 1 yo boy. We were neither set financially nor did we have the time to take care of another life. However, she was set on getting the dog. Now, the dog was a rescue from what appears like an abusive background and we became very well aware of it when we got her. I told her there was still time to return the dog because of all the complications that came with her. The dog was very jittery, wouldn\u2019t eat properly, was not potty trained, and all other sorts. She refused to do so in which I finally gave in, but I told her that she better take full responsibility of the dog. Time went by I got attached to the dog, however she was now tired of it. She decided she want to take it back finally when she was taking the dog out for a walk and it ran away from her causing her to fall. I told her no, because she needs to take responsibilities for her actions. Then, she fully committed on taking the dog back as soon as she found out she was pregnant again. She is saying that she could\u2019ve had another miscarriage, because of the dog. I told her no, so she now does not want to take care of the dog and I am left to take responsibility of the dog, because for one I have become attached to her and I don\u2019t want to send her to a shelter for the possibility of her getting put down. So I have been taking care of the dog I only asked her to feed her when I am not home, because I am the only one that works at the moment. However, now that we moved in to a new home she doesn\u2019t want the dog inside and is very insistent on taking her back. The previous house we lived in had a big back yard and protection from the rain. This house does not so I do not want to keep the dog outside. We constantly have fights because of the dog now and she keeps on saying that I am choosing the dog over her and the kids and is apparently jeopardizing the marriage. Which I feel makes no sense since I\u2019m only taking responsibility for her actions. I am trying to prove a point here, because she is like this with other things.

It doesn\u2019t sound like the dog has any worrisome behavior issues with the kids, and though it may not be the best environment, I can\u2019t imagine that rehoming a dog with an abusive past who has made improvements is a good idea for the dog\u2019s well-being either. Seems like it\u2019d give the dog more issues. \n\nPets are a commitment. It would be different if they were a danger to the kids. But your wife knowingly took on this commitment despite warnings and now wants to back out once attachment is stronger with everyone else (I\u2019m assuming the dog is attached to the family at this point and the kids probably have some attachment too). It\u2019s disgusting and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re advocating for the dog here.\n\nIf you do rehome, at least actually find a home instead of a shelter return.  Your wife needs therapy, your dog needs training, and you need to learn to use a condom.", "ESH, but she sucks more. Wow, that poor dog. Unfortunately, traumatized animals getting jerked around like mere playthings by families with young children is par for the fucking course. I had to go back and check the ages\u2014I cannot believe you are both 25 years old and this immature.\n\nAlso INFO: How do you expect to afford another child if you knew you couldn\u2019t afford a dog?", "ESH \n\nFor starters, getting the dog in the first place. You both should be mature enough to realize that all adults in the home *must* be on board & committed to adding to the family. Now ik that you seem to at least somewhat understand that, but imho you should've put your foot down, so to speak. I normally wouldn't suggest total inflexibility with couple disputes, but there's a factor that's far far FAR more important here. The innocent, troubled, dependent life that's been affected by your actions/inaction. \n\nIf your wife truly refused to listen to your pleas, & took it upon herself to just bring a dog home anyway, I honestly think that you should've returned her yourself at the first reasonable opportunity. If you gave in & actually *participated* in picking up the dog?? AH move on your part.\n\nBut what's done is done, so now on to the present.\n\n*YOU CANNOT \"TEACH YOUR WIFE A LESSON\" AT THE EXPENSE OF AN INNOCENT DOG WHO'S ALREADY FACED ENOUGH MISTREATMENT* \n\nAs it stands, can you genuinely provide proper, adequate,  healing care for this dog? Everything I'm reading here tells me no. \n- The pup is dependent on your wife for the majority of the time. Your wife isn't interested in caring for her, and can't be trusted to do so.\n- Even if said care could be defined by feeding alone (note: it can't), this pup's needs are NOT just those of a normal dog, due to her traumatic past. I suspect I already know the answer, but have either of you taken legitimate steps to address her anxiety issues/rehabilitate her?\n- The pup is being subjected to neglect, & appears to be headed for even worse considering the whole \"not wanting her inside the house\" thing\n\nYou have no choice but to accept that what's best for the dog is absolutely NOT your household. If you truly care about her then you need to put her first, cause at this point the poor thing has just gone from one abusive situation to another. I understand that you got attached to her, but that is *your fault*. Don't get me wrong, I know firsthand how very difficult it is to let go of a critter family member. But that's a hardship that lands on YOUR shoulders, cause it sure as shit should not be her paying the price for your mistakes. Your feelings can't and don't change the reality of the situation. I think (or at least hope) you know that deep down.\n\nI'll reiterate at this point that it is unbelievably wrong, cruel, and probably not even effective anyway, to use a living being for the purpose of \"making a point\". Your issues with your wife must be dealt with SEPARATELY in a way that doesn't cause harm to an innocent victim. \n\n\nTLDR \n\nYour wife has been the AH, I mean, basically every last step of the way here. YTA for letting this go on so long at the expense of the pup, & for thinking it's okay to use her as a lesson. YWBTAH even further if you don't set your feelings aside now, and responsibly rehome\u00b9 your dog. She deserves better.", "Your wife is th AH. Horrible .", "ESH but, weirdly, more you.\n\nIt is not the place or role of a husband to teach a wife a lesson in responsibility or prove a point. Your whole attitude as revealed in the post is kind of gross and infantilizing.

If this is how you talk to her, I can bet she doesn\u2019t want to talk to you.\n\nI powerfully disapprove of people frivolously adopting and rehoming pets\u2014have never rehomed a pet myself and it would take a lot to get me to\u2014so I\u2019m not impressed with your wife.\n\nY\u2019all need serious couples therapy, right away.", "You're wife is a major asshole for keeping this kid. She should either have an abortion or give it up for adoption. There I said y'all can crucify me now.\n\nShe has absolutely NO sense of responsibility whatsoever and the fact that she was 20 when she had her first kid makes that even more obvious.\nShe wanted tthe dog even though you said no and now that you've gotten attached and she doesn't feel like having a dog anymore she wants to get rid of it? What the actual fuck is wrong with her.\n\nDon't give up the dog unless you can rehome her with someone you trust and can stay in contact with. And for all that is holy do not let your wife get an other pet EVER.\n\nNTA", "Nta, but give the dog back. No dog should be condemned to life as a lawn ornament, and if she hates it.... it's quality of life will only get worse.  For a formerly abused animal,  this will only Continue its trauma.

ESH", "For the sake of your marriage, the question often becomes \"do you want to be right? Or do you want to stay married?\". \n\nFor the sake of the dog - return it to be rehomed. We foster dogs for a rescue group. I wouldn't bring a dog from a abusive background to a home with ANY small children, and certainly not 4 of them. \nI also wouldn't leave a dog with a family that only 1 adult wanted to keep. Better for the dog to live somewhere where the entire family will love it.\n\nSilver lining if you insist on being petty - whenever the kids ask why the dog is gone, you can blame your wife.

Would you have them not be able to feed their kids in order to keep a dog?\n\nA human being made a mistake, and keeping the dog when someone in the home resents it is more cruel to the animal than finding someone who actually wants the long term commitment of a pet.
