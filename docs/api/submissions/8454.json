She's always been quiet and kept to herself and introverted. But she is also very moody.  \n\nAfter having our kid, I do remember her telling me she felt like dying. At the time I didn't understand how serious postpartum depression was. So I told her she had nothing to be killing herself over. Ever since, I haven't heard her say anything about the depression.  \n\nI remember a few years ago she was talking to me about a childhood trauma and said she wanted to go to therapy. I told her she didn't need to.  \n\nOne time I caught her just sitting in the shower while it was on. I asked her if she was okay and she said she was fine.  \n\nShe tends to stay up very late and sleeps until she has to go to work in the evenings. I work mornings. So I often come home to our kid just watching TV and my wife is still in bed. She doesn't eat much either.  \n\nShe recently told me she was going to start therapy. I asked her what for but she refused to tell me. I told her I should be able to know as her husband why she's going to therapy. But she said there are things she just can't talk to me about. I told her she doesn't need to go to therapy and that she just needs to be more disciplined in her sleeping schedule, eating better, and working out again and she would be feeling better. When we go to the gym, she just walks on the treadmill and doesn't lift weights anymore.  \n\nShe says I'm being an ass and we went back and forth a bit that ended up in her ignoring me. But I'm just trying to help her without her having to spend money to talk about depression and I don't want them putting her on medication.  \n\nSo am I really an asshole here?", "created_utc": 1674851139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mv2pd/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_doesnt_need_to_go_to/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It turns out childhood trauma is a hell of a thing and you can't \"solve\" it with a better sleep schedule or hitting the gym. Yes, childhood trauma and postpartum depression go hand in hand.\n\nYour wife is having some very serious issues and you're not supporting her as she is trying to figure out what the hell to do about them.

Instead of trying to help her, you are getting in her way.   \n\n\nYTA.", "\" I do remember her telling me she felt like dying, but I chose to ignore that. Now she doesn't want to talk to me about anything. I just don't get it Ya'll.\"\n\nI mean seriously? Of course YTA.", "YTA.\n\nJesus, it just keeps getting worse and worse.\n\nLook--I get it. To someone without mental health issues, it's sometimes hard to see what the problem is. But that doesn't mean that there isn't a problem.\n\nDepression is usually--not always--attributable to a chemical imbalance in the brain. You telling your wife \"you have nothing to be upset about\" is like you complaining at the car for not moving when it's out of gas. There's something that she needs that she's not getting. And while that's not necessarily anyone's fault, it's also not something that will fix itself. \n\nTherapy is incredibly useful in such cases, as is medication if the therapist thinks it's warranted. Medication works to correct the chemical imbalance, just like putting gas in the car. And therapy allows you to not only just talk about your problems, but to get guidance on effective strategies for how to manage the bad things that depression causes. Depression is an insidious disease, because it makes it very difficult to see that there's nothing to be upset about and makes it very difficult to overcome what others might see as trivial obstacles to happiness. It's critically important for you to know that living with depression is like trying to walk with weights tied to your ankles. Everything becomes harder and more exhausting than it should be.\n\nBut don't let me convince you that none of this is your fault, either.  Just in your post, you're showing controlling behavior (\"I don't want them putting her on medication\", \"I should be able to know why she's going to therapy\"), a baffling lack of compassion (\"I told her she had nothing to be killing herself over,\" \"she is also very moody\"), and a thorough obliviousness to the fact that there obviously *is* an issue here.\n\nSuch an environment does not lend itself well to improvement in mental health. It's another weight tied around her ankles, because she knows that her husband isn't there for her--doesn't understand what she's going through, doesn't even *try* to understand it, and is more concerned with money than with her actually feeling better.\n\nSo, go to your wife and say this: \"I don't understand what you're going through, but I want you to feel better. We're going to get you in therapy, and I want you to tell me if there's anything you need me to hold you to. If your therapist recommends trying something, and if I can help with that, let me know.\"\n\nAnd if you have any opinions to the contrary, keep them to yourself. This isn't a common cold she's whining about, this is a serious illness that has apparently affected her for years and it is *way* past time you caught up with the modern world and realized that you don't get to tell your wife whether she's allowed to take medication or seek help.", "Why should she tell you why she wants to go to therapy when you already shot her down several times when she tried to communicate with you? \n\nYTA of the highest order. I had a partner like you. Didn't believe in depression. Made me stop therapy, flushed my pills. It almost cost me my life.

They *know* they should be doing better, but they can't, and that's the depression. Get your head out of your colon and get your wife some serious help, and don't you dare bombard her with questions about it. When she is ready to tell you, she'll tell you if she trusts you, but she can't trust you if you won't trust her.\n\nEdit because I can't let this go:  \n1) Sleeping earlier won't help, because people with depression struggle to fall asleep and stay asleep thanks  to depressing thoughts. I used to call these my \"3AM therapy sessions\" because I'd look back at my whole life and realize why I have certain bad thoughts and habits.\n\n2) Depression can cause a loss of enjoyment of anything she used to like, and that may include exercise for her. \"Exercise produces endorphins, and endorphins make you happy!\" I can tell you right now that not once have I ever been happy after exercising, probably because of the depression. She probably doesn't want to participate in something that no longer brings good vibes. This *also* applies to food. That's probably why she's not eating anymore, especially if she's not eating any favorite foods either.\n\n3) She literally told you that she had suicidal thoughts and your first instinct was \"but you don't have a reason though.\" Sir, she has a reason: depression. The depressive brain isn't always rational, and the suicidal thoughts/ideation are strong enough to give them a reason. Clearly, her depressive brain is telling her that she would be better off no longer living, and that is only something that therapy and sometimes medication can handle. \n\n4) Sometimes medication is necessary in combination with therapy, and if it'll save your wife's life, why would you not consider it as a viable option?", "I hope she divorces your worthless ass YTA", "Of course you\u2019re the asshole.

She's always been quiet and kept to herself and introverted. But she is also very moody.  \n\nAfter having our kid, I do remember her telling me she felt like dying. At the time I didn't understand how serious postpartum depression was. So I told her she had nothing to be killing herself over. Ever since, I haven't heard her say anything about the depression.  \n\nI remember a few years ago she was talking to me about a childhood trauma and said she wanted to go to therapy. I told her she didn't need to.  \n\nOne time I caught her just sitting in the shower while it was on. I asked her if she was okay and she said she was fine.  \n\nShe tends to stay up very late and sleeps until she has to go to work in the evenings. I work mornings. So I often come home to our kid just watching TV and my wife is still in bed. She doesn't eat much either.  \n\nShe recently told me she was going to start therapy. I asked her what for but she refused to tell me. I told her I should be able to know as her husband why she's going to therapy. But she said there are things she just can't talk to me about. I told her she doesn't need to go to therapy and that she just needs to be more disciplined in her sleeping schedule, eating better, and working out again and she would be feeling better. When we go to the gym, she just walks on the treadmill and doesn't lift weights anymore.  \n\nShe says I'm being an ass and we went back and forth a bit that ended up in her ignoring me.

YTA.", "YTA. \n\nTLDR: your wife needs to see a clinical psychologist and/or psychiatrist yesterday. She may be a danger to herself right now. Lifestyle changes are not enough. \n\nThis is not normal behaviour. She has a medical problem that may be life threatening. I am not a psychiatrist, simply a neuroscientist, however she sounds like she may have severe chronic depression. She needs professional medical intervention. That intervention may just be seeing a clinical psychologist but it may be accompanied by medication. That medication could be for a short period of time or it could be something that she takes for the rest of your lives. A prolonged hospital stay might also be required depending on the assessment of health care professionals (psychologist, psychiatrist, general practitioner) that will be treating your wife.\n\nYou suggested lifestyle changes which are indeed helpful however they are not enough. Think of this as something like diabetes, medical intervention is needed alongside diet, exercise, healthy sleep, and social support. All of your lives will have to change moving forwards so you can all get on top of this issue. This will be difficult and will require you to take on carer responsibilities that you have likely never done before. Additional support for you should also be considered to ensure that you can maintain your mental and physical health as well. The aim of the game will hopefully be to prevent this from happening again. However there is a real possibility that the ideal outcome will be to minimise the severity of future depressive episodes and to have a plan in place that catches this before it gets so bad that she is simply existing as opposed to living. \n\nBe the husband that she knows you can be. Help her and in doing so help your son, your family, and yourself.", "YTA. If she was exhibiting very obvious symptoms of a broken leg would you not want her to seek appropriate medical help, possibly including medication if a doctor deems it necessary? \n\nDepression is very real and very very dangerous. It kills many of its victims - that statistic increases drastically in patients who do not have outside support from loved ones. You could very well be pushing her toward a breaking point and if you love her you will get her help.\n\nYou and the money you saved on therapy will be very lonely together when she is gone.", "YTA. Stop trying to be your wife's therapist when you clearly dont understand it and are highly unqualified to give her mental health help. Let her do whats right for her and actually be supportive.
