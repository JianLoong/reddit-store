You don't know anything about him really, and the fact that he won't facetime and tried to guilt you into giving him your address are huge red flags \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9. Don't share any personal information at all and consider ending the friendship.", "NTA. Listen to your gut.

You followed your gut instincts so good on you.", "NTA\n\nFollow this policy in the future too. No sharing personal contact details too, esp if they\u2019re related to social security, banks, etc.", "NTA. You did exactly the right thing.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Sounds like this person is not who they say they are. Trying to guilt you into giving your address is definitely predatory behaviour. Blocking them was the right thing to do, I would also report them, I doubt you are the only young person this predator is trying to get to.", "NTA Good job, kid. You did great.", "NTA\n\nYou did the smart thing. No means no, and someone you don't really know over the internet asking for your address is always a big red flag, especially if they had no real reason to do so. Guarantee this person was not what he claimed to be to you in some way and had malicious intent.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely do not give him your address or personal information! It\u2019s suspicious that he would insist on you telling him. He\u2019s definitely not up to any good if he\u2019s trying to guilt you into telling him no matter how long you\u2019ve known him. If he wanted to actually be friends, he\u2019d understand and not insist any further.", "NTA this could be very dangerous, he could be an adult pretending to be a child", "You did a smart thing. Why wouldn't he show his face? That's a worrying sign tbh. NTA", "NTA, I am guessing that the person on the other end is not 14 at all.

Your safety needs to be your priority, always. Block them and be careful w whom you share your personal information", "NTA.

You were raised well and you trusted your instinct. That's a very smart call. Well done.", "NTA\n\nYou are very smart. You did good mate. Never ever ever ever give out personal info such as your address. No matter what. Especially if they never face time or stuff.", "NTA - Also a huge red flag that he tried to pressure you by saying that all his other friends were giving their addresses, and that you were \u201cinvalidating\u201d him. Friends don\u2019t pressure friends like that.", "I didn't really expect anyone to reply since this is my first time using reddit to post so I really appreciate your feedback. Thanks a ton!", "Your reaction is right\u2026. If you don\u2019t know him nor has he shown his face to you, you are right not to give him your address.\n\nAlso the way he guilted you about invalidating him and the others giving their address is a big red flag."]}
