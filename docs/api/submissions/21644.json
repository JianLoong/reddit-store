Sounds like this person is not who they say they are. Trying to guilt you into giving your address is definitely predatory behaviour. Blocking them was the right thing to do, I would also report them, I doubt you are the only young person this predator is trying to get to.", "NTA Good job, kid. You did great.", "NTA\n\nYou did the smart thing. No means no, and someone you don't really know over the internet asking for your address is always a big red flag, especially if they had no real reason to do so. Guarantee this person was not what he claimed to be to you in some way and had malicious intent.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely do not give him your address or personal information! It\u2019s suspicious that he would insist on you telling him. He\u2019s definitely not up to any good if he\u2019s trying to guilt you into telling him no matter how long you\u2019ve known him. If he wanted to actually be friends, he\u2019d understand and not insist any further.", "NTA this could be very dangerous, he could be an adult pretending to be a child", "You did a smart thing. Why wouldn't he show his face? That's a worrying sign tbh. NTA", "NTA, I am guessing that the person on the other end is not 14 at all.

Your safety needs to be your priority, always. Block them and be careful w whom you share your personal information", "NTA. Something ain't right.", "NTA, you don't have to be polite when you're in a dangerous situation. You be as rude as you need to be to protect yourself. You were raised well and you trusted your instinct. That's a very smart call. Well done.", "NTA\n\nYou are very smart. You did good mate. Never ever ever ever give out personal info such as your address. No matter what. Especially if they never face time or stuff.", "NTA - Also a huge red flag that he tried to pressure you by saying that all his other friends were giving their addresses, and that you were \u201cinvalidating\u201d him. Friends don\u2019t pressure friends like that.", "I didn't really expect anyone to reply since this is my first time using reddit to post so I really appreciate your feedback. Thanks a ton!", "Your reaction is right\u2026. If you don\u2019t know him nor has he shown his face to you, you are right not to give him your address.\n\nAlso the way he guilted you about invalidating him and the others giving their address is a big red flag.", "I\u2019m an older adult and thus have never had to deal with a situation like yours. I am SUPER impressed with your level of maturity in this matter.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nWell done for protecting yourself, as a mother I am so proud of you for trusting both your instincts and what you have been taught.  You are the very opposite of TA, you absolutely did the right thing. Your friend sounds very sketchy and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re who they say they are.  Your mature and sensible attitude has probably saved you from something horrible.  Can I ask you to please be brave a little more and report this situation to both your parents and law enforcement, as someone else they\u2019re talking to may not have the same wisdom as you.  You could potentially save multiple people from a very dangerous situation.\n\nWell done for keeping yourself safe, and possibly other people too.", "He\u2019s not 14. Good job keeping yourself safe!", "Nta", "NTA! Good job trusting your gut feeling - the fact that he a) won't face time, b) won't show you his face, and c) kept pushing and guilt-tripping you points to your instincts being 100% correct. It all sounds very sketchy to me. Never worry about being 'mean' when your spidey senses tingle and your safety is on the line.", "He's not 14. NTA, and good for you for cutting him off. Don't back down from that! Even if he showed you a picture now, or agreed to FaceTime, you don't already know his voice. How would you know the picture is a recent one of him, or that the person you're facetiming is really him? You did the right thing. Don't let anyone tell you differently.", "NTA you did exactly what you should have done. All your instincts were on point, and you not only set boundaries, but enforced them. So many people have trouble with both.\n\nI am sorry that you had to say goodbye to someone you thought was your friend, that isn't a good feeling at all, but these were the natural consequences of him being creepy, pushy, entitled, and gross.\n\nMake new friends, continue being awesome. <3", "NTA. How do you know these other 'friends' even exist? Unless you've talked with them yourself on voice chat I'd be doubtful, especially combined with the fact he's never shown you his face and refused to facetime you. There's a very good chance he's just lying to try and use the pressure of imaginary peers to get you to cave. RED. FLAG.  \nYou did good by blocking him. Always put your safety first online.", "Even when i started playing online games in my 20s i never gave out my address to anyone.  Still do not to this day.  You are being smart NTA", "NTA SAID When my children started playing online games, my rule was if someone started asking for their address it was sus. I told them to give them the address to the police department in a different city.", "NTA - you did completely the right thing not giving out your info. As others have said, please tell your parents about this, just to be on the safe side.  \n\n\nYou might also find this video campaign from the NZ Govt a useful watch (it's on YT): [https://youtu.be/89jOufetX1c](https://youtu.be/89jOufetX1c) and there is additional support for young people as part of the same campaign here: [https://www.keepitrealonline.govt.nz/youth/](https://www.keepitrealonline.govt.nz/youth/)", "NTA you\u2019ve done the right thing.

NTA", "NTA\nYOU DID THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT THING!!\nMake it a rule for yourself that you never give any identifying information to anyone unless you are expressly told by your parents that you can. That means no school info, exact birthday, street address, sports teams names or other extra curricular things you are involved in and where you undertake these activities. \nAlso -\n1) him never face timing or showing his face to you is a huge huge red flag that he is not who he says he is\n2) can you speak with your parents about this? Some kids can\u2019t so that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking. If you can, please let them know what happened & give them all the information you have about this person.\n3) if you can\u2019t speak to your parents but you\u2019re still worried speak to a school counsellor.\n\nI can\u2019t stress enough that your instincts were right on the money.

You have more backbone than people twice your age. The fact that he won\u2019t facetime you but is so insistent on having your address and trying to guilt you into giving it is such a red flag. A real friend wouldn\u2019t act like this. Good for you for following your instincts!", "Even if he *had* facetimed you and so on, it's still a good idea to avoid giving out full names and addresses \u2013 it only takes one bad argument for someone immature to think it'd be a *really* funny idea to SWAT someone, which gets people killed\n\nAs it is, with the amount of guilting and suspicious behaviour, it's fairly likely that the person on the other end of the chat was a grown-ass adult. Avoid at all costs", "you don\u2019t ever have to give someone your address if you don\u2019t want to, even in real life. when someone (you) says no, and the other person (your friend) keeps pushing, it is very natural to stop wanting to spend time with them, or block them. when people don\u2019t listen when you say no, they\u2019re showing you how they will treat you. good for you, standing up for yourself. nta.\n\nedit: typo"]}
