Even *if* you regularly facetimed, he doesn't need your address. And even if you decided that you wanted to meet up, it's better to do that in a public place - a bar or a cafe - and to have a parent tag along.

We made a date in a crouded area to meet for the first time, and only shared personal info like addresses once we were comfortable. Granted this was more for her comfort than mine, but still...
