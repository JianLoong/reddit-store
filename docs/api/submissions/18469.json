I was so focused on the moment, I did not realize at the time that my dad\u2019s wife, let\u2019s call her Sue, brought out her phone and made a spectacle of herself to record my dad\u2019s and my entrance. \nWe found out later, second-hand from many, many others that during the actual ceremony Sue was making decently loud negative commentary about our officiant, DURING the processional she was loudly asking questions to the other side of the aisle, and then, again, DURING the processional running across the aisle to change sides. We are extremely worried her running commentary will be caught by the mic\u2019s 2 of the groomsmen were wearing to capture the videographer\u2019s audio. \nWe laughed it off as just poor behavior but nothing too serious, that is until we logged into a popular social media app and saw that Sue posted the entire entrance with my dad. B and I were adamant about not wanting our ceremony posted, since this was not something we had decided if we wanted yet. Also, she was in the bridal suite when we asked our officiant to say the notice. \nI messaged my dad directly to ask Sue to remove the post, and then commented on the post itself to be removed.

But, the video was not removed.
