The rent is only about $50 per month, plus about $50 for utilities as we got the apartment through housing assistance. Usually it's me paying all of the rent even though the apartment is in my mom's name and it's only supposed to be her living here. \n\nFor some context, my brother helps my mom with rent and other expenses when I'm not able to. He has his own business and has really good income so normally he's more than happy to help us with things. My bf and I work but my mom doesn't, and usually I don't need any support from my brother since I have my own income; But my mom regularly asks him for money for things she doesn't even need.\n\nAnyways, my mom is extremely confrontational, both verbally and physically though I won't go into detail. But recently, I finally snapped and texted my brother about everything she has been putting us through. I even sent him videos of some of her behavior. She's about 60 years old but she acts like a petty child most times. She also refuses to work, and regularly takes my car without asking. She wrecked her own car, totaled it to be exact. Every car she's ever had she has wrecked. If I tell her she can't take my car, she starts getting verbally aggressive and if I don't give in, she won't stop. She also doesn't have a license anymore due to her reckless driving.\n\nAfter sending the videos and explanation to my brother, he didn't say anything directly to our mom. However, recently, she asked him for some money recently yet again, this time for makeup and a new phone because she broke hers. My brother flat out refused; Saying he had seen how she's been behaving and mooching off of both me and him, and throwing tantrums when she didn't get her way. He didn't say it was me who showed him proof but since I'm the only one my mom is really around, she knew I was the one who had talked to him. He said he is still willing to help me if I ever need it, but he said from now on he absolutely refuses to help my mom in any way financially. She's threatening to throw my bf and I out due to this; though she's threatened it many times before and never followed through with it. She knows that if she does she won't have a car to use nor a way to pay rent unless she gets a job of her own.\n\nSo AITA for basically ruining her only source of financial support?", "created_utc": 1667157101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhn2ky/aita_for_telling_my_brother_how_awful_my_mom_is/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not only is your mother toxic and abusive, you are all breaking the law living with her in subsidized housing. If you're struggling financially then the obvious solution is for you and your boyfriend to apply for similar housing of your own, you're the ones paying for everything so there's literally no reason to stay in this situation. If you're having serious money troubles and the move would be difficult, then that's exactly the sort of situation you should ask your brother to be helping you with.\n\nNeither of you should be helping your mother.

You all realize that with housing assistance, if they learn the two of you are there, the three of you will get evicted?!", "NTA, so why are you still living with her? You are nothing more than her wallet and a guaranteed source of income. You should be paying something for living somewhere but not at the expense of physical and mental health. Your BF and yourself should pull together your incomes and move out. You two might even qualify for financial assistance.", "You can't let her drive your car while unlicensed! Don't let her have access to the keys! The potential for things to go very badly wrong is so huge. What happens if the housing assistance people find out you are living illegally with your mother?
