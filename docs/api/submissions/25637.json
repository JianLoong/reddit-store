It seems as it is family's fault that his current GF is unhappy", "why doesn\u2019t his family just include the other kid? Everyone here sounds like they are generating unnecessary drama. Maybe instead of jumping to no visits you explain the actual problem to your ex. Esh", "ESH\n\nI can tell you what the problem is right here:\n\n>**\"Since my kids come from a \u201cbroken home\u201d my ex and his family go above and beyond to try to make up for that fact.** His girlfriend has had an issue with it from the start but recently things have escalated to the point where my daughter has been telling me she doesn\u2019t want to go stay with her dad because she feels like she\u2019s always in trouble because **his girlfriend gets mad whenever he or his family do something nice for my kids that they don\u2019t do for hers**.\"\n\nYour ex and his family are AH's if they are doing ANYTHING to treat the three children (that are all his) in that household differently. **So by your own description, they are giving YOUR two children special treatment \"because they come from a broken home\" and special presents, and special treats and not giving the child he shares with his GF the same presents and treats. Of COURSE his girlfriend is advocating for her child.** Wouldn't you do the same if every time your children went over to your ex's house, they came home and reported that replacement half-sister got all these presents from Daddy and grandma and grandpa that they didn't get? Of course the GF is rightfully pissed.\n\nThe right answer here is not to reduce custody time. The right answer here is for your ex and his family to stop treating your two children like the spoiled golden children and shunning the girlfriend's child. Then I suspect the friction with the GF will improve.", "Nta. When a 7 year old tells you they don't want to be at their own fathers place, it's pretty serious.", "NTA, you're acting according to what your daughter told you. He shouldn't make her do things that are not comfortable for her and he definitely should talk to his girlfriend.", "Just a suggestion, would you be able to meet up with his girlfriend and talk it out with her. \n\nIf he is over spoiling your kids then in time they will get more difficult to manage.  \n\nMaybe if you and her can provide a united front on treating all the children fairly and not treating them differently because of the \"broken home\" then he might see that he and his family are the issue.", "NTA  \n\n\nMake it clear to the ex, if things continue as they are he will loose his kids, they are already saying they don't want to go over his place because of how his GF is treating them. He can say he is trying to resolve it to his hearts content but so long as his kids feel unwelcomed he will loose them.  \n\n\nHe is not being fair to your kids, his GF or his GF's kids regarding this. Suppose the role was reversed and you got to see him spoiling her kids all the time and not yours, suppose he went above and beyond for hers and yours just yeah they are there. Would you feel resentful to him for that, thats the situation she is in. She is wrong to take it out on your kids though she should be taking it out on him.  \n\n\nHis failure to fully address this is going to cost him everything, it will cost him his kids with you (and already is since they dont want to visit him now) his GF who is lashing out at your kids when they are there because of her resentment towards him, and assuming her kids are also his it will cost him them as well because they will see the blatant favouritism.  \n\n\nHave a proper conversation with him, taking his kids away from his is not the answer. Pointing out if he cannot properly address this somehow to find balance it is going to cost him everything is.", "You can\u2019t just change the visitation because you want to change it. You would have to petition the court and this is not grounds to be successful. You can express your concerns to your Ex and that is the extent of the power you have.", "NTA - you need to fight for your daughter and Im glad youre doing so. But you also have to see that thats a really drastic measurement in his eyes. If thats the right approach depends on your daughter. In the end she has to make the call if she feels welcome and wants to be there. And if not, her dad has to respect that and talk to his gf how she has created this topic environment that has cost him having his kid around.", "NTA - Your ex is a huge AH, though. When you told him that your daughter doesn\u2019t want to visit because of his GF he should have IMMEDIATELY taken steps to resolve the situation.  There should never have been a reason to speak about it a second time.", "NTA but this is a job for lawyers.", "NTA . the father\u2019s girlfriend needs to be checked & court dates need to be ordered . something is going on for your 4 year old daughter to say that to you", "YTA \n\nYou don't get to decide on when he gets to see him own children! Happily married people have disagreements on how they parent. This is why he should take you to court and get a custody agreement. So you can't stop him from spending time with his children on a whim. Yes he should talk and work things out with his gf- but also they should try to treat all children equally and if she's perceing inequity then that should be addressed too. But you're honestly insane to think that means you can lessen his time with his children. It literally takes criminal acts and close to criminal acts to terminate or lessen parental rights. \n\nThis honestly can't be real. \n\nNo way is anyone divorced this immature.", "YTA. Not for you to say how the kids are treated when they are with dad unless there is physical abuse or trauma. In this case there is stress because all the kids aren\u2019t being treated the same, which the adults can remedy if they get their heads out of their asses.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and I\u2019m getting tired of having to explain that I\u2019m not trying to keep our kids away from him.\" .. that is EXACTLY what you tried to do.", "Oh good, another bitter woman trying to keep a man\u2019s children from him. \n\nYou let him go darling. If you didn\u2019t want him to build another family with another woman, you shouldn\u2019t have let him go. \n\nWhether you like it or not, his kids are every bit as much his kids as they are yours. You can do whatever mental gymnastics you need to do right now to make him the ass in this situation, but you are actively trying to come up with excuses to keep a man\u2019s children from him, for no good reason other than you want to.

He has every other weekends but she allows him to see them whenever he wants. She could just go back to the original agreement if she wants to.\n\nIf the kid doesn\u2019t want to go to his dads because stepmom is being unreasonable and dad refuses to do anything about it then I would do the same thing. She\u2019s not stopping him from seeing the children.\n\nI think everybody needs to sit down and figure out what\u2019s going on. The child should not be afraid to be at the Dad\u2019s house. Go back to the every other weekend and see how that works and if things get better then allow him to see them whenever they want. This is why custody agreements are so important.", "Read the story. Agreement was originally every other weekend.

Going back to the original custody agreement is fine if he is not going to try and work this out. She never once said she doesn\u2019t want him to see the children. The child has to be the priority. Again she never said he could not see his child", "Again read the story! She\u2019s not stopping him. Their custody agreement says every other weekend but she has been very good about allowing him to see the children whenever.\n\nIf the child is uncomfortable at the dads house it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to go back to the original custody agreement.\n\nShe is not stopping him from seeing the children. She is putting her child first. The only thing I could say is get everybody involved especially The stepmother because that seems to be the problem here and figure out what can be done. But the child has to come first and the father doesn\u2019t seem to want to do anything about the situation.", "But of an extreme reaction. She's stated It's the kids raising the issue, and she's relayed this to the ex who has done nothing about it. \n\nHow is she the asshole for being stuck.on the middle?", "It says he has a daughter with his girlfriend. It doesn\u2019t say his girlfriend has a daughter from a previous relationship.", "Every adult in this situation is doing the wrong thing. The GF, according to OP, hasn't been okay with the situation with the other children being favored with gifts and her child being left out since the start. This doesn't make her sayin anything to the kids okay. But I am also not impressed with OP for sitting smugly by while her children are showered with treats and presents and their half-sibiling is left out. How would she feel if that was her child being treated that way? And she's just fine with that? What a trash person. And of course the ex and his family are completely trash people for giving two children loads of treats and leaving out his 3rd child/grandchild. \n\nEvery adult in this situation is behaving horribly and should be ashamed of themselves. Every adult in this situation should come together and say ENOUGH. Stop spoiling the first two kids and leaving the 3rd kid out. Even if the OP changes the custody, does she really think it will be in the best interests of her children to have a distant relationship with their father? That will hurt them more growing up, as well as having a half-sibling who will resent the hell out of them for always having been treated as the golden child. If these adults want to do right by these kids, they will sit down and resolve to treat all of these man's kids the same while they are at his house. Period.", "To be fair, all the OP states is that \"I suggested my ex goes back to only having visitations with our kids until the drama between him and his girlfriend is resolved.\" She doesn't state that the GF is necessarily targeting the child but rather the child states \"she feels like she\u2019s always in trouble because his girlfriend gets mad whenever he or his family do something nice for my kids that they don\u2019t do for hers\" which could mean that the ex or his parents decides to spoil the first two children with big splashy presents and not the 3rd child, and the GF and the ex get into a fight over it. Nothing directed at the child, but the child witnesses the fight over the 3rd child being neglected AGAIN and it sours the presents.\n\nI do think every adult in this situation is behaving like a trash person and a selfish parent. Ex and his family need to stop playing Disney Dad and treat all 3 children in the house equally. GF has already stated she is not okay with it. OP is clearly in support of the unequal treatment and it might help if instead, she would be a united front on behalf of all the children (would she want her kid treated that way?) and say all kids need to be treated the same by their bio dad/grandparents and get the same treats/gifts.", "I read that as saying that she wants wants the father to have short time visits outside his home because the daughter feels uncomfortable. \n\nthat doesn't include every other weekend. \n\nhe would have to do a lot more than being insensitive to his daughters feelings for the OP to ban the children from staying at their father's house.", "The problem is being created because the ex and his family are treating the OP's children like the spoiled golden children and giving them extra presents and treats that they don't give the child ex shares with his girlfriend. That is bound to create resentment between half-siblings who all live in the same house part of the time and share the same father and grandparents. \n\nThe GF is doing the right thing in advocating for her child who is being mistreated by the ex and his family, just like I think the OP would advocate for her two children if the shoe was on the other foot and the new child GF/ex share was being showered with treats and presents the two children from the first marriage weren't getting. All the children in the household should be treated fairly and that is on ALL the adults in this situation. The ex and his parents are at fault for spoiling the two children of OP's and leaving the newest child out in the cold. And the OP is at fault for sitting smugly by and allowing it, saying \"well, they get a lot of extra treats and attention the other kid doesn't get because they are children of a broken home\" and then putting on her shocked stupid face when this causes tension with the mother of the other child. The ex needs to not be an idiot and treat all his children the same and insist his parents do so as well. And the OP needs to rather than blaming the new GF, lay down the law with her ex and tell him to stop spoiling their kids with presents and treats the half-sibling isn't getting, which will only turn their kids into brats, and ruin any relationship between the siblings (not to mention, sour the relationship with their father if they don't get to see him as often which will matter much more to them in the long run.) No adult is doing the right thing in this situation and changing custody is not the solution.", "she's the asshole for thinking she can change a custody agreement unilaterally over this issue. \n\nnot her call to make! \n\na father has rights to his child and his children are too young to determine/influence custody baring crminal acts of abuse and neglect.", "Exactly what power does OP have over her ex and his family?", "And the father has no dice in this? He's the asshole who is failing to deal with the issue created by his family, and his partner.\n\nThe child doesn't want to go for a reason. If he's any kind of father he'd take that seriously and be responding to it."]}
