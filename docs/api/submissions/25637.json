Of COURSE his girlfriend is advocating for her child.** Wouldn't you do the same if every time your children went over to your ex's house, they came home and reported that replacement half-sister got all these presents from Daddy and grandma and grandpa that they didn't get? Of course the GF is rightfully pissed.\n\nThe right answer here is not to reduce custody time. The right answer here is for your ex and his family to stop treating your two children like the spoiled golden children and shunning the girlfriend's child.

The GF, according to OP, hasn't been okay with the situation with the other children being favored with gifts and her child being left out since the start. This doesn't make her sayin anything to the kids okay. But I am also not impressed with OP for sitting smugly by while her children are showered with treats and presents and their half-sibiling is left out. How would she feel if that was her child being treated that way? And she's just fine with that? What a trash person. And of course the ex and his family are completely trash people for giving two children loads of treats and leaving out his 3rd child/grandchild. \n\nEvery adult in this situation is behaving horribly and should be ashamed of themselves. Every adult in this situation should come together and say ENOUGH. Stop spoiling the first two kids and leaving the 3rd kid out. Even if the OP changes the custody, does she really think it will be in the best interests of her children to have a distant relationship with their father? That will hurt them more growing up, as well as having a half-sibling who will resent the hell out of them for always having been treated as the golden child. If these adults want to do right by these kids, they will sit down and resolve to treat all of these man's kids the same while they are at his house. Period.", "To be fair, all the OP states is that \"I suggested my ex goes back to only having visitations with our kids until the drama between him and his girlfriend is resolved.\" She doesn't state that the GF is necessarily targeting the child but rather the child states \"she feels like she\u2019s always in trouble because his girlfriend gets mad whenever he or his family do something nice for my kids that they don\u2019t do for hers\" which could mean that the ex or his parents decides to spoil the first two children with big splashy presents and not the 3rd child, and the GF and the ex get into a fight over it. Nothing directed at the child, but the child witnesses the fight over the 3rd child being neglected AGAIN and it sours the presents.\n\nI do think every adult in this situation is behaving like a trash person and a selfish parent. Ex and his family need to stop playing Disney Dad and treat all 3 children in the house equally. GF has already stated she is not okay with it. OP is clearly in support of the unequal treatment and it might help if instead, she would be a united front on behalf of all the children (would she want her kid treated that way?) and say all kids need to be treated the same by their bio dad/grandparents and get the same treats/gifts.", "I read that as saying that she wants wants the father to have short time visits outside his home because the daughter feels uncomfortable. \n\nthat doesn't include every other weekend. \n\nhe would have to do a lot more than being insensitive to his daughters feelings for the OP to ban the children from staying at their father's house.", "The problem is being created because the ex and his family are treating the OP's children like the spoiled golden children and giving them extra presents and treats that they don't give the child ex shares with his girlfriend. That is bound to create resentment between half-siblings who all live in the same house part of the time and share the same father and grandparents. \n\nThe GF is doing the right thing in advocating for her child who is being mistreated by the ex and his family, just like I think the OP would advocate for her two children if the shoe was on the other foot and the new child GF/ex share was being showered with treats and presents the two children from the first marriage weren't getting. All the children in the household should be treated fairly and that is on ALL the adults in this situation. The ex and his parents are at fault for spoiling the two children of OP's and leaving the newest child out in the cold. And the OP is at fault for sitting smugly by and allowing it, saying \"well, they get a lot of extra treats and attention the other kid doesn't get because they are children of a broken home\" and then putting on her shocked stupid face when this causes tension with the mother of the other child. The ex needs to not be an idiot and treat all his children the same and insist his parents do so as well. And the OP needs to rather than blaming the new GF, lay down the law with her ex and tell him to stop spoiling their kids with presents and treats the half-sibling isn't getting, which will only turn their kids into brats, and ruin any relationship between the siblings (not to mention, sour the relationship with their father if they don't get to see him as often which will matter much more to them in the long run.) No adult is doing the right thing in this situation and changing custody is not the solution.", "she's the asshole for thinking she can change a custody agreement unilaterally over this issue. \n\nnot her call to make! \n\na father has rights to his child and his children are too young to determine/influence custody baring crminal acts of abuse and neglect.", "Exactly what power does OP have over her ex and his family?", "And the father has no dice in this? He's the asshole who is failing to deal with the issue created by his family, and his partner.\n\nThe child doesn't want to go for a reason. If he's any kind of father he'd take that seriously and be responding to it.", "NTA- why are so many commentators mad at OP about the fathers family not treating the kid with girlfriend the same.  OP has no control over that.  Her job is to go to her ex about their kids ONLY.  If dad doesn\u2019t fix the issue that makes OP\u2019s and ex kids feel unsafe, then mom will need to take further action, like going back to court and asking judge only allow dad at visitation since he\u2019s not married to the GF.", "NTA Though your ex and his family are complete and utter jerks for fawning over your kids and ignoring his youngest daughter.  Then he slanders you?  WTF??  I think you should go back to only visitations until your ex learns how to be respectful to the mothers of his children.", "INFO:  when you say the ex and his family are spoiling your kids and not their half-sister, does that only mean on the weekends they are over?  Does their half-sister treated well/ spoiled by your ex and his family when she is the \u201conly child\u201d of the house?  Of course, a 3 year old can\u2019t make that distinction, but the gf should be able to (and want their father to bond with his other children when he can!)\n\nI think it is a E S H situation. The ex and his gf suck for fighting in front of the kids to the point where your kids hate going, but it also sucks to be condoning special treatment. And it might be seen as \u201cif my kids don\u2019t get special treatment over their half-sister, then they can\u2019t come\u201d (although clearly that isn\u2019t what you\u2019re doing - but it may be perceived that way, especially to the gf).", "Ehs.

The problem is the GF is rite to be resentful, she is just directing it at the wrong people she should be resentful for Father and his Family not OP's children.  \n\n\nIf father does not fix this issue his GF will continue to be resentful and continue to take it out on OP's children leading to OP's children not wanting to spend time at fathers (like the already are stating)  \n\n\nFather's child with GF will grow up also resentful as that child will see OP's children being favoured and spoiled over them.  \n\n\nGF will continue to grow more and more resentful and continue to lash out more and more.

He is not protecting his children. He is awful. You are definitely not the asshole here. You are just doing your job as a mother and doing what you can to protect your kids. Do not let him make you feel guilty for it ever. Keep at it. And do keep setting that record straight for as long and as loud as you have to. Keep telling people over and over again how his partner is bullying your children and making them feel bad for nothing at a time in their life when they are supposed to be growing, loved, protected and safe.", ">my ex and his family go above and beyond\n\nNotice how OP isn\u2019t doing this or advocating for it. What is she doing that makes her an A H? She can\u2019t make ex and his family stop favoring them, she can\u2019t control GF\u2019s unfair targeting of her children. She is doing the only thing she can: attempting to remove her children from a toxic environment, at their request.\n\nOP is obviously NTA for doing everything in her power to fix the situation and nothing wrong.", "It\u2019s not OP place to say anything to the family for how they treat her kids and what they buy them. The issue really is the girlfriend telling the 7 year old how she feels or directing any misplaced anger towards a child. The issue is the ex and his family. The girlfriend needs to speak up. OP is trying to find a solution so her kids feel welcomed around the girlfriend. The ex and his family is the real assholes.", "Yeah, so you think they should stick with the custody agreement? That\u2019s him seeing his kids less. She\u2019s giving him above and beyond the custody agreement. This whole situation is on the dad to begin for treating the kids differently. The girlfriend is an ass for taking it out on the other kids, but I don\u2019t blame her for being pissed.", "I always felt anxious/guilty when my parents fought. Granted, my parents tended to take their bad temper out on me afterwards (scapegoat/oldest) but my siblings also felt nervous/on edge/guilty. I still get that feeling when people are fighting near me, especially when it's related to me (even when I know that I didn't do anything wrong). I'm not saying 100% of people are like me but I don't think it's unusual.", "A grown woman has no business taking that out on a child. It\u2019s not her fault. If she has a problem with what his family is doing then she needs to settled it with them. Op is NTA", "His own fault for staying with his GF. He's not going to end up with a relationship with his own kids.", "Given the short age difference between OP's youngest and the GF's baby, I'm wondering if a affair was involved, and the ex is feeling guilty. The ex's family might be holding the gf and her daughter responsible, hence the disparity between how they treat their grandchildren", "She is the mother and all she needed to be doing was telling them it wasn\u2019t healthy for the children and if not stopped she needed to speak to the kids and explain their home isn\u2019t \u201cbroken\u201d and they still have two parents who \u201clove\u201d them but it sounds more like she likes the idea of her kids being thoroughly spoilt and ruined cause that isn\u2019t doing the kids any good either \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "None of that is in the post\u2014she factually reports what the ILs do and think, that\u2019s all. She never said she agrees.", "I would suggest that you get your kids to a child psychologist, get yourself to a lawyer, and get yourself, the psychologist, and the lawyer to court to get your children away from your husband's GF.  Do it yesterday.  \n\nNTA", "That\u2019s literally what she is writing about! Her child are treated differently by the girlfriend.\n\nThe OP can\u2019t change how her ex in laws treat their grandchildren. That\u2019s a conversation for the ex and his parents. Just like it\u2019s his responsibility to reign in the girlfriend. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest, there\u2019s a huge overlap in this relationship by the ex with his girlfriend and their child. There was probably infidelity. We have no idea how the ex in laws feel about that relationship and the child but it\u2019s not the OP\u2019s fault. This all comes down to the ex.", "Definitely!", "Not her job to reason with her ex\u2019s affair partner. It\u2019s his job to man up and deal with the mess he has caused. Why does this woman need to fix everyone else?", "The phrase is in quotes because it was said by someone else. Not her. Understand how grammar works.", "Definitely an affair based on the ages. I think your take is correct regarding an affair and how the in laws feel.", "Literally none of that in her post.", "Not the OPs responsibility to work with the affair partner regarding her affair baby and how her ex\u2019s parents are handling this situation. It\u2019s her cheating ex\u2019s responsibility to deal with his parents, his affair partner, and his children.", "Kids normally and often feel guilty when parents argue over them. Feelings are not rational, including or especially the children's ones.", "None. OP has no power over the gifts they receive and would sound crazy to try and tell his family they need to start buying his new girlfriends child gifts too\ud83d\ude02", "Made a similar comment. There is an obvious overlap on relationships based on the age of the children. Whatever the fallout with the ex in-laws falls to the ex and whatever he and his girlfriend did. There is obviously some resentment by his parents, which again is not down to the OP.", "Well actually it is. Didnt realise she was an AP. But the fact remains someone in her childs life is being unfair to her child. So it is absolutely her job as well as her exes to get involved. Of course the hope is that her ex would sort it. But he hasnt. So now she has to step in. Is it fair? No. But being a parent isnt fair.", "Where did this whole special presents and treats come from maybe the fathers family shows them more attention cus they see OP 2 kids far less and see the girlfriend and fathers kid daily..."]}
