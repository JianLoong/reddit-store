(Also, sorry for formatting. I'm on mobile)\n\nSo I live in Florida, and we just had the hurricane hit, and because of where i live, i couldn't stay home, so i stayed with my BF's family. We are all okay. We just had a lot of flooding.\n\nBut he has a 6 year brother (S), and he isn't the nicest to animals. I had to bring my with me, and I told him, and so did his family not to touch or hold my animals.\n\nI have a 13 year old dog and two young cats. S constantly was picking up my cats and laying full weight on top of my dog, and I told him many times to stop. \n\nWhat ended up causing tension and his parents getting upset was he was holding my kitten by his legs and I told him three times to stop then I had to raise me voice to finally get him to drop him. \n\nNow I get I could have gone over and got him, but I was helping pack stuff up.\n\nI got told not to raise my voice at him, but I asked him three times not to mess with them, but he kept doing it. \nI didn't get in trouble, but anytime I tell S not to touch or bother my animals, I always get a look from his dad. \n\nMy BF has also told S not to mess with them, but he wouldn't even listen to him even though the kitten he was messing with is our shared cat.\n\nMy animals will ALWAYS come before people, even if they are my BF's family. \n\nI don't know if I'm the asshole for raising my voice. I don't feel like I am it just bothers me that I'm the one in trouble even though he was messing with my animals.\n\n\n\nEDIT/UPDATED: okay to clear some confusion I'm seeing in the comments, the house was very small and there was no way for me to put my animals in one room my dog always follows me around she is old and I'm her person and my kitten was getting comfortable and was running around. \n\nIt was only S dad that was mad at me for getting on to S. My boyfriend was very supportive the whole time. He kept S way from his brother and tried to keep our kitten in a separate room.\n\nMy animals are now way from S and will not be around him for a while unless it's an absolute emergency like it was now.", "created_utc": 1693495615, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166e7a7/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriends_little_brother_to/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Animal abuse is a red flag of a psychopath- they need to address their kid's issues and stop enabling his behavior.", "NTA...If I'm understanding correctly, his parents saw him mistreat the animals and didn't make him stop.  You raising your voice is a lot less harmful than him hurting an animal.", "NTA\n\nWhere are the parents in this?  As a parent, punishment would have already ensued for a number of reasons...\n\n1. That is an animal, not a toy\n2. He was told not to touch the animals, he has broken that rule\n3. He has been told repeatedly he is breaking the rule from (2), escalating the issue\n\nThe dad should be handling it, not glaring at you for doing his job for him.", "NTA. At 6 years old, kids should know enough about not doing things that make animals uncomfortable, especially when repeatedly told not to do something.", "Nta, yes they took you in at a time of need but you made it clear the conditions of your stay and they agreed. I assume you'd have looked elsewhere. They shouldve disciplined their own kid", "NTA. \n\nI have a 2 year old autistic son and he doesn't even act this way around animals. \n\nHis parents need to do better.", "100% NTA. That kid needs to be dangled by the legs", "Of course you're NTA, but pay attention to what you've learned here.   There seems to be an epidemic lately of couples \"sharing\" pets, and this can end very badly.   There's just no reason for 2  single people to share them.  \n\nIt's doesn't help that your bf comes across here as not supporting you enough with an animal  you share.  It's his family, not yours!  You say he agrees with you, but that isn't enough.  If nothing else, get the kitten to safety in a separate room.\n\nAnyway, the point here is you need to find a way to establish ownership of these kittens.  Do it through microchip, or whatever works.  Don't hide it from him, but simply point out that this really disturbed you, and you do not want these kitties to be around that child again.\n\nIf it sounds extreme, maybe so, but you call yourself a huge lover of pets.  That always means first and foremost you protect them.", "NTA. You just tried to protect your furry friends, so no, you're definitely not the AH. I hope your pets are safe. Personally I don't think raising your voice was wrong since the boy didn't listen. Maybe you could talk with your boyfriend's parents to find a solution so you don't have to defend your pets like that...?", "nope, that kid is very disrespectful and his parents seem, just from what you said, to be somewhat entitled", "NTA - they need to control their kid's ridiculous behavior even if you are a guest.", "NTA. Children need to be taught to handle animals correctly, if I were in your position I\u2019d do the same thing. If the family won\u2019t correct the behaviour, I\u2019d sure as hell put my foot down too.", "Definitely NTA. It\u2019s the parents\u2019 job to teach their young kid(s) to be gentle with animals. Also telling you not to raise your voice at him even after you repeatedly telling him not to hurt them, and which I\u2019m assuming they did in front of the child, instead of teaching him to be gentle, only teaches the child that what he\u2019s doing is right and what you\u2019re doing (like telling him not to hurt animals) is wrong. \n\nI had a kitten who died after my cousin\u2019s son, also 6 at that time, grabbed him by his tail and kept swinging him around and yes, in front of the adults and no one said anything. When I saw what he was doing, I was horrified and immediately told him to stop but instead I got yelled at by my mom and cousin (his mom). After like a few seconds, my kitten tried to escape from him but instead he fell and hit his head on the ground and hurt his leg. After that, he had stopped eating and I had to feed him (food, medication, water) but eventually he died because he was struggling too much. \n\nSorry if this got too depressing but children being rough with animals, especially smaller ones, do have deathly consequences.", "NTA. But his parents are the ones who need yelled at. They heard you ask him three times to be nice to the cat and still let him do it.", "NTA. Honestly maybe nobody ever raising their voice at the kid is part of the problem here.", "NTA. Those animals are your responsibility. Time to step up and be a good guardian. Get that child out of your house before he hurts one of your animals, hurricane or not, ot you will be TA. Remind them that this is how serial killers get started. Who cares if it insults them.", "You moved into a six-year-old's environment. So, train him gently - not harshly and then I can see fully supporting you.\n\nMy concern is that your BF's parents could ask you and you menagerie to leave. And your pets will suffer more. \n\nYWBTA if you think this can't get a lot worse very quickly.", "ESH. Of course the kid shouldn't be messing with the animals.\n\nBut these people have taken you in because you're homeless at the moment, and your response is to complain about these hosts and say \"my animals will ALWAYS come before people.\" Like, WTF? Are your animals going to be better off if these people kick you out into the floodwaters? If we're into ranking here, maybe they think (naturally enough, IMHO!) that their family has more right in their house before you and your animals do... I think it's reasonable to talk and ask them about finding ways for the kid not to tormet your pets, but the reality is you're a guest and that consciousness seems kind absent here. I do not at all see why your animals must 'always come before people'... in this case the people whose house it actually is! If I were the host Dad and that were your attitude, I'd be looking at you weird too, since this entitlement/ingratitude is really bonkers.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kids don't know their strength yet. That being said, I grew up on farm and my parents would always teach me not to be rough with animals, treat them with kindness. However, a few times I didn't listen and my mom and dad would let the animals teach me a lesson. A cat scratch, cat bite, and an angry bark or two taught me real quick that I needed to be nice to animals.", "NTA but is there a room you can get your animals away from the little brother. I had to evacuate for Hurricane Ida my ex mil can\u2019t stand animals so I kept my dogs in one room away from her", "NTA for raising your voice. You have a right to protect your pets, 6 is way beyond old enough to understand \u201cgentle touch\u201d and the parents should have already have stopped him, or at least backed you up when you tried to stop him.\n\nBut just for your own sake in the future, with people you want to keep a good relationship with, it might be worth stopping the packing for a moment to physically remove your pets from this child\u2019s grasp. Speaking as a parent, it can be hard to hear someone scold your child, even if they deserve it. It\u2019s just kind of a knee-jerk defensive thing. I\u2019d never let my child mistreat an animal, and I\u2019d always back up and enforce someone\u2019s direction if my child was ignoring what they were being told. But, yeah, it can be hard to be rational in the moment when you hear someone raise their voice to your kid. Which is why I\u2019d go over and physically remove my pet from a demon child rather than yell/speak sharply, just to keep the tension down.", "Uf my 4 year old can understand  that he can't hold and handle our cats in certain way, 6 year old can understand too. If he is still dealing improperly with them despite telling him and explaining him multiple times, either his parents failing in teaching him, or he has behavior issues that needs experts' help. Either way OP NTA.", "NTA, you have a responsibility to your pets to protect them from everything that you can reasonably protect them from. That includes poorly behaved children. Honestly the parents should have taken him to his room or been holding/playing with him to distract him from the animals. I have experience with children with disabilities, and if an autistic 4 year old can be taught how to play nicely with a kitten then a 6 year old should be able to do it as well. It sounds like the parents are not particularly good at doing their job. You didn't do anything wrong, you never laid a hand on him. I actually don't care if you were screaming at the end, it would have been your right when he was treating youe animals so poorly.", "His father ought to be ashamed for not stopping his son himself.\n\nAnd honestly - I've never had trouble with kids that age if I explained the appropriate way to act around a dog or a cat. Never, ever. I know kids have different levels of impulse control and all that, but nevertheless, if S is having trouble grasping this concept his parents really should be more on top of his behavior.", "Obviously NTA. Children who are cruel to animals tend to grow up to be psychopaths. If your bf's parents don't want to prevent this, they're going the right way about it. In the meantime, protect your animals however you see fit and feel no shame.", "NTA I long for the days when people actually disciplined children ....my kids are grown but any of my grandkids doing that would be meeting my version of \"Towanda\" (Fried Green Tomatoes reference)", "NTA\n\nnext time you see him approach one of your animals, stop what your doing and shoo the animal away from him.", "Exactly this, I used to work with children with significant developmental delays, and often, how to treat animals, small children, and other vulnerable individuals were ones we had to work on frequently. I never had too many issues with them learning it if their parents were active and participating. If your two year old and all my kiddos could learn this, then there isn't an excuse for just letting it happen.", "My boyfriend knows the kitten is mostly mine. He lives with me and is getting a getting a micro chip as soon as I get the money. \n\nHe is also very helpful with all my animals. I put more about to in the edit, but yes, they are my animals by owner ship, but they are both of our animals.\n\nAlso, this is the last time they will be around S until he learns to keep his hands to himself or until he is older!", "Its their house, though. So, I think OP doesn't have much room to negotiate how she behaves around their six-year-old. The kid was dead wrong. But, its not OP's home. And she could face getting the boot if she doesn't gentle her tones around that kid. Tell him no, certainly. Just don't yell at him.", "OP is a refugee guest living in these people's house. Aside from yelling at them, what does it mean to \"put one's foot down\" in a situation like this? OP's only option is to give the ultimatum \"if you don't stop meddling with my cats, I'm going to leave!\" and the family's likely response is going to be \"uh, great, we actually only had you here because you needed to be....\" All in all, probably the best course of action.", "He wasn't in my house I was staying with his family! This is the last time until he's older or learns to keep his hands to his self. He is gone now and my animals are safe", "I get what you're saying, and yes, I did move into his environment, but it wasn't just my animals he was being like this too. What bothered me the most was that they were only correcting his behavior with their animals, not mine.\n\nI told him many times before this not to mess with them and even pulled him a side and explained to him that my animals are to not be played with like toys. \n\nI was gentle at first, but it got to the point that I had to put my foot down", "Absolutely not. Humans know better than to not mess with animals in a way that they don\u2019t appreciate.

And if I had someone do that to one of my two kittens? Idc who they are.  My fiance, my little brother, my fiance's old as dust grand ma, im yelling.  She didn't slap the kid or anything, just told him that if he's going to disrespect and possibly harm her animals to not touch them.", "This.", "That doesn't mean the kid can treat the animals like that. OP has the right to protect them, and if the boy won't listen and his parents won't do anything against it, what should have OP done in your opinion? You're just assuming that they aren't grateful but that's not the point here. Even if you're right but still, we don't know how they think and feel about being a guest.", "My bad, I misread, it's early where I live. Glad you are out,  that kid should never be around your furry friends. I'm surprised your BF didn't help more to stop his cruelty.", "I'm not saying that she shouldn't protect her animals, but just that her prerogative is to leave and not to dictate things to her hosts in their own home. She and her animals are the ones needing and taking favors....", "OP should have..... left?\n\nThat's what I would do if I took my kids to a place and then I realized it wasn't a good environment for them. I wouldn't yell at my hosts whose house it is. I would leave and get my dependents to a better place. It sounds like she was crashing for free at this family's house, but if the pet environment is that important, then this is why people evacuating for storms either rent a room in a pet-firendly hotel or board their animal once they've driven outside the storm path. If for some reason OP can't or won't do that, then we're back to the reality that these people are doing her a favor by letting her + animals stay.... I think once OP realized the family home wasn't a good place, s/he should have just ponied up the money to pay for space.", "So if I need to stay with my grandparents for a week then I should just let them abuse me because im asking for favors? That's basically what your saying.  He's mishandling a kitten who is very fragile and an older dog who is also very fragile.  Just because she's asking favors does not mean the boy can abuse her animals.", "It was a hurricane! There was no space. Idk if you have even been through an actual disaster, but you can't just waltz up to the local hotel and book a room. You have to be like 13 years old from how little you know of the world. Often once it starts you are stuck where you are lest you literally die to flying debris, surging floodwaters, or other issues.", "I'm not trying to be rude but I don't think you understand my situation, I live on the coast of Florida right where the hurricane hit I couldn't leave because all of the roads were closed due to flooding there was no way I could leave. If I could have left, I would have. All hotels around me were booked, and none had pet friendly rooms. I was told by my boyfriend that I was staying with them, and I didn't argue because I knew I would be safe there. His family is very nice, and I am very thankful for them letting me stay.", "What part of hurricane do you not understand? I\u2019m pretty sure she would be going back to the place. She would normally stay if she could also, I\u2019m glad you changed your answer from your the asshole to everyone\u2019s the asshole here.", "No, I don't recomment that you stay with people who are abusing you. Again, my recommendation would be to LEAVE.", "I can yell that anyone mishandling my animals. Even if that's your child or the presidents child.  \n\nAnd if they're welcoming her to stay then she should respect her property she brought with her.  By law, animals are property.", "TBH, if you know your animals are being abused and you just yell and scream at the hosts instead of actually removing your animals from that situation, then you're guilty of any damage done thereafter . Think how harshly we judge human parents who leave their kids for extended periods of time in contexts where there is a known abuser. Find a way, GET OUT. I just think OP is wasting his/her time trying to change the parents/kids behavior in their home. If the behavior is truly abuse-level serious and OP's priority is the animals' safety, then there are actions that need to be taken to exit the situation.", "NTA. S and his useless dad need to be kept away from animals. Indulging him and enabling will only lead to him targeting vulnerable victims.", "NTA. Parents who don't want you to say things to their childen should? Exactly, discipline their children and/or stay away", "NTA.\n\nI know you were in their home, but it was because there was a hurricane so you had to be there. \n\nHis dad needs to parent and not glare at you. Animal abuse is wrong and 6 is old enough to be gentle.", "Or one of the animals getting hurt or scared and hurting the kid, then OP would have been the one getting yelled at", "This, 6 is old enough to understand not only the word 'no' but also consequences.", "This seems a little extreme. It doesn't sound like the kid was torturing the animals, more like he was just never taught how to respectfully interact with them. The kid's still a shit for not listening when told to leave them alone or put them down, but the parents are really the assholes for not teaching a young kid how to be respectful towards animals and letting this happen in the first place.", "That's true. The first sign of a sociopath or psychopath is cruelty towards animals. Also OP, no you are NTA. He is causing physical pain and instilling fear into animals and that is not okay. You are doing the right thing by protecting them from someone who will cause them harm. I'm frankly shocked his family isn't appalled by his behavior and actually thinks you're an AH for not wanting your animals to get hurt or killed. They need to take him to a doctor like a psychiatrist. Hurting animals will turn to hurting humans.", "EXACTLY", "Absolutely!  A very good point.", "They did teach him, he just never listened! He has been very harmful to their own pet. He grabbed their few weeknold kitten and was shaking him (he was completely fine, just scared). It's has gotten to borderline torture because of the way he will grab and hold some of their animals", "What are you talking about??? I'm sure OP has a degree in Netflix documentaries and is well qualified to accuse a 6 year old of being a murdering psychopath for *laying on a dog and holding a cat by the legs* \n\n/s ffs", "So what is OP supposed to do, wait until the kid actually causes harm to one of the animals?", "Seen it happen too many times, kid mistreats dog, eventually dog bites kid, parents have the vapours and grasp the pearls, dog and dog owner are blamed in SPITE of multiple warnings and attempts at stopping kid, dog ends up dead because parents won't PARENT", "Okay yeah that sounds a little more extreme. I'm glad your pets are safe now, I wouldn't allow the child in my house at all at this point.", "Toddlers as young as 2 can be taught (and are receptive to) how to be kind to animals, if they\u2019re being aggressive at age 6 where their brain is able to register that their actions are causing the animal to be in distress-  then yes, it\u2019s red flag indicator that the child lacks basic empathy."]}
