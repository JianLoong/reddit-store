They do not visit often (usually four times a year) even though they live close by. They do not support us financially in any way. Recently they went on vacation and wanted to come by because they had gifts for the children. I've never stopped them from visiting so was happy to set a time today. They came today and my twins who are two did like there gifts which were two teady bears. They were uncomfortable because they don't know there grandparents. They were pushing themselves on the kids and forcing hugs ect. Nana mentioned over and over that the toys were $15.00 each. As if she felt they were unthankful or something? I am sure these toys will be played with and I said so several times. I said thank-you repeatedly. My kids are behind in language so we're unable to say thank-you but I think they liked them. She continued to go on and on about the gifts that were not asked for. It got really uncomfortable for me so I got up and took $30 from my purse and paid for the toys. She took the money and didn't mention the cost again. She said the cost at least ten times in two hours. While I think I shouldn't have to pay for anything I didn't ask to be bought I could not listen to it any longer. My boyfriend is mad now that they have went home saying I embarrassed them.\n\nDid it make me an asshole for paying them back implying that they are too poor to buy an inexpensive gift?", "created_utc": 1693875242, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16a9om7/aita_for_paying_the_inlaws_back_for_gifts_given/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not the amount spent but the intent. Also, I can\u2019t stand when family members try to force affection from kids especially when they don\u2019t know them well.", "NTA.  Your actions spoke louder than any words she could have said.  You're right in thinking that she saw her so-called gifts as something that put you in debt.", "Not the AH. Shitty grandparents who think $30 worth of teddy bears makes them good grandparents whom the kids don't even recognize", "> implying that they are too poor to buy an inexpensive gift?\n\nThat's not what happened here. Your MIL thought $30 would buy her a ticket across your kids' boundaries and got flabbergasted when she found out it didn't. So you refunded her money. That's just good customer service.\n\nNTA", "So they mentioned the price multiple times. It's either they wanted money/wanted to make themselves seem superior to you/call you poor. You did great by giving them money. So now it's not like u owe them or anything. Idk why your boyfriend is upset, but that's a red flag... Good luck OP! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\nNTA btw", "NTA. If they didn\u2019t want the money, they would have refused and said they were a gift. That they didn\u2019t say that suggests that those weren\u2019t gifts from the grandparents, they were just delivery drivers.", "Nta. I think it was an appropriate response. You don\u2019t tell people the cost of the gift. That\u2019s inappropriate.", "NTA- I don't blame you!", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t want to be reimbursed, why did she bring it up? My only question is why you allows them to force hugs on your children? My child is a hugger by nature, but if someone ever forced a hug on him if he didn\u2019t want it, I would intervene immediately.", "NTA. She went on and on about the cost until you paid her the cost, then she stopped talking about it. Seems like she was expecting that payment. She doesn't seem like she was embarrassed. Your bf needs to understand that she was mollified with the money so that was what she wanted. She never tried to refuse it - therefore you read the room correctly and did what she expected of you. You are fine.", "Nta, they mentioned the money and if they didn't want it they wouldn't of taken it", "NTA. Why did she take the money? She could have refused. Seems like she got exactly wanted she wanted: the money. Your boyfriend is an a-hole to you here", "NTA.  They embarrassed themselves by constantly bringing up the cost.", "NTA, i have family that behaves similarly. if your in-laws are talking so much about the exact price of the thing they bought, i would\u2019ve taken the hint that they expect money back. and then if they don\u2019t expect money back, they\u2019ll say \u201coh no, don\u2019t worry about that, my treat\u201d or something of the like. this whole situation is uncomfortable and you handled it well IMO.", "NTA, I subscribe to this reaction so much. She was trying to manipulate and guilt you and your kids. She\u2019s the one who should be embarrassed and your bf needs to grow a backbone. His mother was being a jerk.", "NTA\n\nThey don\u2019t interact much with your children, so naturally the children won\u2019t be the typical \u201csuper happy to see grandma & grandpa!\u201d\u2026 for a 2 year old, not seeing someone for months at a time is a very long time\u2026 these people are like strangers to them. \n\nIs your MIL materialistic by chance?\n\nMaybe she\u2019s thinking the price of the gifts should mean the children appreciate it & her more\u2026 \n\nBut they\u2019re 2 & totally not going to understand that concept.", "NTA, this was a weird one. The grandparents attitude was werid like they expexted to be fawned over for the gifts they brought.", "it's like the people in these comments have never interacted with old people before. my grandma will repeat the price of things and over and over because either she thinks the price correlates with the quality or she can't believe it's that expensive. OP, you may not have been trying to be rude, but nonetheless you hurt their feelings. clearing the air is the right thing to do here. NAH.", "Yes you are. Your kids have no issue with them or the toys. You clearly have an issue and you\u2019re projecting it. It\u2019s not a mature way to handle things", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't just reward her shitty passive aggression with money or you'll be expected to pay for everything they buy your kids without asking", "NTA. I'd have asked outright if we needed to reimburse for the cost of the gifts. Why else did she keep bringing it up?\n\nEven my MIL who does that sort of thing \u2014 and she's one of two people I know who does that \u2014 would quit after the first mention. She and my SIL both want us all to know what a great deal they got on the items \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af", "NTA 30 whole bucks they spent on the kids and were expecting what in return ?? Your kids to play happy families with them for pics? Nope that was too high a price to pay and you did the right thing . They seem truly weird", "NTA\n\nJust really odd", "I think she was mad they weren't hugging her/posing for her Facebook photos to her satisfaction. I can't be sure but that's what I'm thinking. No gifts at all were necessary. My kids have toys", "I did. I told them several time to stop and it's happened on repeated visits. I had to take both kids to sit with me to stop it", "That's what I thought too. If buying a toy was out of there budget or something they didn't want to do they didn't have to buy it. I already know the other grandchildren get many more gifts and attention/sleepovers/vacations. I couldn't have cared less if they had not gotten a toy when the others did. My kids wouldn't have understood because Nana and poppa are complete strangers to them so they wouldn't have ever expected anything", "I would say she is. She has called me before her birthday and mother's day and requested specific expensive gifts. I have not purchased them because she is extremely absent in our lives and has never called on mine or my boyfriend's birthdays or mothers/fathers day never mind a gift. She also calls our son Jack the wrong name repeatedly every visit even though we correct her (Jackson/Jake/Joe/ ect)", "$15 for a teddy bear is pretty cheap, though. We're not talking luxury toys here", "She was mad about them not posing to her satisfaction in photos. My daughter was excited about the stuffy and was flapping her arms so she couldn't get the best picture. My son was tired so he didn't want to cooperate", "What AHs.", "I would have told her \u201cmoney can\u2019t buy love\u201d as I handed her the $30.", "Well they are two so they  just behaved totally normally then . You did the right thing definitely .", "My kids are very loving. They really like our local librarian as well as a babysitter we have watch them occasionally. They just don't know who they are at all so feel overwhelmed by them. Money never buys anything. They need love from their grandparents and some of their time on a regular basis to get it back."]}
