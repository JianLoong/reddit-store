I am sure these toys will be played with and I said so several times. I said thank-you repeatedly. My kids are behind in language so we're unable to say thank-you but I think they liked them. She continued to go on and on about the gifts that were not asked for. It got really uncomfortable for me so I got up and took $30 from my purse and paid for the toys. She took the money and didn't mention the cost again. She said the cost at least ten times in two hours. While I think I shouldn't have to pay for anything I didn't ask to be bought I could not listen to it any longer.

My fil married a woman who was nuts like that.They came over (before i got off work) & ordered a pizza. When i got there a few mins later, my husband called & ordered 2 subs for us (he wasnt sure what plans i made for dinner). So later that evening when she got me alone, she was demanding i pay for half the pizza even tho my fil bought their pizza & we had subs (my fil had $). She even wanted the 12cents. Fil got our daughter a johnny jumper, she literally stole it off my doorframe (at 1, it was her fav toy-mine too). It wasnt much, it was the point (her son was expecting & she didnt want to wait, even tho they have to be older to use). My fil made her turn around after she drove an hour & half home & bring it back w an apology.  Ppl like this dont get better either. If you try to bite your tongue for peace, they see pushover. Next they will expect you to buy the Christmas presents. $15 isnt much for a teddy bear or for any gift (esp for grandkids), so the fact that she keeps bringing up the price is insane.
