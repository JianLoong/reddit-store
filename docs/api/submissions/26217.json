I am sure these toys will be played with and I said so several times. I said thank-you repeatedly. My kids are behind in language so we're unable to say thank-you but I think they liked them. She continued to go on and on about the gifts that were not asked for. It got really uncomfortable for me so I got up and took $30 from my purse and paid for the toys. She took the money and didn't mention the cost again. She said the cost at least ten times in two hours. While I think I shouldn't have to pay for anything I didn't ask to be bought I could not listen to it any longer.

My fil married a woman who was nuts like that.They came over (before i got off work) & ordered a pizza. When i got there a few mins later, my husband called & ordered 2 subs for us (he wasnt sure what plans i made for dinner). So later that evening when she got me alone, she was demanding i pay for half the pizza even tho my fil bought their pizza & we had subs (my fil had $). She even wanted the 12cents. Fil got our daughter a johnny jumper, she literally stole it off my doorframe (at 1, it was her fav toy-mine too). It wasnt much, it was the point (her son was expecting & she didnt want to wait, even tho they have to be older to use). My fil made her turn around after she drove an hour & half home & bring it back w an apology.  Ppl like this dont get better either. If you try to bite your tongue for peace, they see pushover. Next they will expect you to buy the Christmas presents. $15 isnt much for a teddy bear or for any gift (esp for grandkids), so the fact that she keeps bringing up the price is insane.

She would just see something, think we would like it and buy it to surprise us on her next visit. She never said how much money something cost even when my father, her son, asked directly. Grandparents aren't obligated to buy gifts for their grandchildren, expensive or not. But when and if they do, they can't try to use these gift to guilt and emotionally blackmail parents or grandchildren", "Pretty dodgy and not uncommon behaviour. They may be family but toddlers who barely know them they are strangers who keep trying to hug them. \n\nNTA", "These people sound insufferable, you are NTA. Next time they want to play happy grandparents, meet a park 30 minutes before nap time. No hosting, no obligations. I hope your bf sees how fake his parents are and doesn't continue to force them on your family.", "They suck, you are NTA. Maybe don't see them much from now on?", "fuuuuck that used to make me crazy with my MIL. She decided that she would call my son Benji. I was like \"that's not his name and he doesn't like you calling him that.\"  She ignored me. Then he ignored her if she called him that (he's autistic, so to him, she wasn't talking to him since she knew what his name is) She did it until one day she snapped \"I'm TALKING TO YOU.\" He said loudly and slowly \"MY. NAME. IS. BEN!!!!\" and walked away. I think he was 5. lol He was sick of her shit.", "Then why was he upset?", "I don't think any do. She shouldn't be shocked because there are two other young kids in the family", "You are lucky if you can get even one of the twins to look at the camera. Forget about getting them both to look.", "In my experience, cats of any age and 2-year-old humans are very similar in that regard \ud83d\ude38", "My sisters a photographer and her son would smile everytime he saw a camera lens/phone camera as a baby cause she would get super excited when she got a good photo\n\nHes older now and a little model, even asks her to go take pictures sometimes lol", "My 2 year old will, but only for me or her mum, and you have about 6 seconds to get the shot before she gets bored or distracted \ud83d\ude02", "My niece is 2 actually and she will smile and pose and look adorable for photos and has been doing so since she was 1. She actually will ask, \"auntie take photo\"", "I can get mine to either sit/stand still OR smile, never both and even then she will only sit/stand still if her big brothers are with her", "Good job, Ben!", "Mine does... but I'm a hobbyist photographer so she sees a camera n goes \"Model time!\" In her Lil head lol\n\nBoth my girls were Lil posers. It's my 9yo who I can't get to smile nice for one these days lmao", "My nephew learned young to pose for pictures because he has been photographed daily as a baby / toddler. Most people don\u2019t have time and patience for that", "I can't even get my 3 and 8 year old kids to look at the camera at the same time", "My dog poses for photos. Haha. And by poses I mean that when I hold my phone a certain way, she knows to sit still until I put my arm down. And then she usually gets a treat.\n\nI can't always get her to look directly into camera though.", "My niece would pose if you waived a camera in her direction, my nephew only if he felt like it because of what he was doing for example I have a lovely picture of him in grandad\u2019s hat because he thought he was being cheeky and asked me to take it", "My twins are 16 now and still look in different directions", "I accidentally taught my spaniel to stare nose first into the camera ;) be thankful yours isn\u2019t so obsessed and thinks it\u2019s the treat machine when you pick it up.", "Now tempted to see if I can Pavlov my 9yo with treats for pics \ud83d\ude02", "I found one trick is to line the shot up and then look at the dog over the top of the phone, most dogs will hold eye contact long enough for a picture but get bored and look away the second your attention is off them when you look at your phone."]}
