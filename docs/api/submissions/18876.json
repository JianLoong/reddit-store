And they replace nothing. \n\nIt sounds like they've been taking a lot more than the basics based on this.  Who seriously goes rummaging through someone else's liquor cabinet?  OP should just cut off beach house access if the family can't handle it.  They're already getting free shelter and saving hundreds to thousands in lodging expenses to vacation on the coast.", "This sounds accurate. \n\nIf I had to make a guess, they probably think \"well you didn't *earn* this money so we are entitled to some of it\" (as if suffering the loss of your partner isn't price enough)\n\nYou are well within your rights to not stock your home with food to accommodate them. Tell them if they have an issue with it they are welcome to go pay for their own hotel room\n\n\nOP is absolutely NTA", "And for them to even bring it up and feel entitled to you, your home and money is ridiculous.", "This is the way.", "I LOVE red velvet cookies, I volunteer to be your family!", "I cant cook for shit, but i have Dash Pass!", "I'll bring the bourbon!", "My mousse cakes are to die for and incredibly sought after in the family (and what I bring when I visit my family member's cottage).", "Dammit. Now I want lasagna.", "Yum lasagna!", "This is typical for us as well for a reasonable stay of 1 day upto 4 weeks. Good food and drinks are made available from whichever side is the host. There is some missing context in this case.", "Sounds to me the family kind of expects to be hosted and OP  is to sweet to tell them to find someplace else. \n\nI get not wanting any trouble with the relatives, so indulging them halfway by hosting them and then letting them figure out themselves hoe to eat and drink at least seems less annoying than letting them plunder your place too.", "Only have food in the house they don\u2019t like.  Staunch carnivores???  You\u2019ve gone vegan.  They think Doritos are spicy???  Ghost peppers in everything. Even the water.", "The entitlement is infuriating but what upsets me is that OP didn\u2019t get the financial windfall from an inheritance or the lottery; it\u2019s from a settlement from her husband\u2019s untimely death.", "Muahaha. I initially pictured the tap water\u2026nothing says \u201cGTFO\u201d like the first time they brush their teeth or wash their face they get pepper-sprayed eyeballs and mouths", "yikes i feel like thats TOO evil hahaha!!!\n\nwe just want them to gtfo not suffer severe pain", "Oh no, I realized they meant bottled water and my initial read is, like, HIGHLY illegal and hopefully impossible, lol\n\n(The bottled water is also too much, ha)"]}
