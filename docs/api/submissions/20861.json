It is also your parents' responsibility to fend for your rights and space in your household and manage the rest of the household to make room for you and your needs and obligations.\n\nYour parents are dropping the ball big time in this situation and seem to be trying to make you take care of the younger children so they can slack off in that department.

Not only are you right that both you and the person you tutor deserve to have an uninterrupted session, but what they are allowing to happen is rude regardless of what activity you are doing.  The adults don't seem to care about your established boundary, and giving you that level of independence and respect is necessary for anyone, especially if you're still underage.  Good on you for finding a non-harmful and creative solution.\n\nAlternatively, I don't know if this will work depending on their ages, but perhaps you can see if a different approach might appease your parents while still maintaining your boundary.  It seems to me like the kids may be barging in because they really like your company, so finding a way to reward the kids when they listen to your sign and refrain from entering might go a long way towards not only making everyone happy, but also teach the kids about respecting boundaries in the process.  The reward need not be a physical object either.  They would probably find you spending some time with them after your sessions doing something fun for a little while as a good trade.  You could start the reward system before removing the spider decoys and once they start responding to it, start removing spiders.", "NTA.

My library has conference and study rooms, so you can speak quietly and not disturb others.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like they just want you to distract the kids.", "NTA they just like the fact that they didn't have to be responsible for the kids when they were bothering you. Your parents and aunt are dropping the ball in regards to not enforcing your boundaries", "NTA but please take note of how little respect your family has for your boundaries.... not just your aunt but your parents as well.", "NTA. And I must say GENIUS!!!  This is by far the most creative, non-threatening way to get those two to respect the boundary of your door.  (We all KNOW a door IS a boundary, some people just don't get it though!)  (I personally LOVE those fake spiders, so fun!)\n\nNTA by far and with that kind of creative thinking, I think you will do well in life.  Don't let anyone make you feel like you need to question YOUR boundaries for YOUR health and comfort.  They are not in your head or body, it's YOUR body, YOUR boundary.  \n\nI do advise trying to get away sooner rather than later, you seem like you're really smart and family forcing you outside your comfort zones, or INTERRUPTING your WORK environment is bad enough.  I hope it doesn't get worse.  \n\nRegardless of the kids and mom and the divorce situation, the are STILL KIDS, and kids NEED DISCIPLINE.  If they are not getting disciplined NOW, they are going to be hellions to deal with down the road.  We all go through rough spots in life, but that is NO REASON TO CHANGE THE RULES regarding polite interactions and RESPECTING OTHERS' space, room, phone call, property, car, job site...yeah...", "NTA and I noticed the other loophole you could use; 'Door can remain locked while getting dressed'. No timelimit is attached to that statement. If it takes you several hours to get dressed, so be it.", "> My parents also don\u2019t let me lock my door unless I\u2019m getting dressed.\n\nFound the AHs.\n\nYou found a creative and funny way to get rid of the spoilt little pests, NTA.", "Psychologist's perspective: your parents claiming that your aunt would get depressed if she actually started parenting is utter bullshit", "the thing that stuck out to me was the fact that poor auntie can't possibly discipline her children because then she'll be depressed! come on?! I realize she is going through a hard situation and navigating through this change, but... seriously? you have an obligation to tutor someone, you aren't being unreasonable at all for wanting the respect and privacy you deserve. kids learned their lesson. NTA.", "NTA - you respected your parents wishes and although they may not like the solution they gave you no other option. After all you have been very reasonable. You should ask them if I have to keep my door unlocked and do work uninterrupted how would they solve this problem?", "NTA. To hell with Aunt Savannah! It's your room and you are entitled to privacy and the peace you need to do your job.  Although if I were you I would start spending as little time there as possible.", "NTA - It looks as if your aunt and parents assume you are the kid's nanny/entertainer. They don't want the children to be afraid to be in your room because that means they will go into another space - probalby theirs.", "Now ive never been married but im assuming a divorce isnt an excuse to not be a parent to your kids", "Am lmao on this one. My kids do that all the time, i play along pretending  am crappin myself, they lap it up and grandpa loves it.", "NTA.\n\nBesides everything already pointed out on the thread for why you're NTA, your parents aren't even considering that they're completely disrespecting students (possibly strangers to them) who are going out of their way to get tutoring. You're doing people a service by volunteering your own time to help others and your family is just upset that you aren't volunteering your time to them, to take care of your cousins for them.", "Lol, NTA. Sorry, but your parents don't seem like particularly nice people", "NTA. you dont mention how old you are, but I'm assuming late teens due to Honor Society. These are little children. They do not need to be barging into anyone's room for any reason without at least knocking. You have nothing really in common with them besides the biological link. Everyone just allowing for the kids' behavior is just enforcing that rules and boundaries will not apply to these two because they are \"going through something\" and THAT is not the way to raise children.", "NTA. This is brilliant \ud83d\udc4f", ">My parents told me I was being mean to children whose parents just divorced and I should be ashamed with myself for purposely scaring them instead of being more patient.\n\nThose kids have 3 parents on their side while OP has none. So without going through parents divorcing, somehow OP is worse off than kids whose parents just divorced, while in their own home under the care of those legally responsible for their well-being. And OP is the one who should be ashamed with themselves?\n\nOP, NTA. And I appreciate how you also look out for your tutees even though it isn't a paid job. Your sense of responsibility, fairness in empathy and respect, creative problem solving, and overall intellect seems to make you the minority in your surroundings. I wish you the best.", "NTA.  A practical and clever solution!", "NTA doesn\u2019t matter if their parents are divorced, still being little assholes.", "NTA.  \n\n**You are being disrespected by everyone** in that house, and they are all using the excuse of Aunt's circumstances to justify how they are mistreating you.  \n\n**You should be allowed to lock your door,** anytime, for any reason.  \n\n**You have not done wrong.**  But **every 'parent' in the house is being a bad parent** about this.  Parents are supposed to teach respect by showing it, including to you.  Parents are supposed to teach you that privacy is allowed, not prevented.  Parents are supposed to support you in your work, whether it's paid or not.   Parents are supposed to teach younger children to be polite and compassionate to others, and even through Aunt's crisis, it's still her job to teach her children to not harass you, and to respect your privacy.  She's failing as a parent.  Your parents, as the ones in charge, should be taking up that lack on Aunt's part, not agreeing with her permissiveness and disrespect.\n\n**If Aunt plans to stay long, it might be necessary for you to find a way to move out.  I doubt they are going to realize that they are all being terrible parents,** to use her divorce as a reason to mistreat you.  Which means it's possible that they will all continue to find new ways to mistreat you, to deal with their tension by targeting you.", "Buy them a kid's drum set and place it where all the adults hang out.", "NTA.\nAunty needs to control her feral children.\nYou did a great job at deterring them without hurting them.\nYou\u2019re the hero on this one.", "NTA, but do you have another location you can go outside to tutor, like renting a study room out at a local library or at the student's house? Is it done remotely?", "NTA. I probably would have actually been mean. Hey you said something to your parents, they did nothing. They forced you to handle it. They should be happy you handled as nicely as you did.", "I know that this is a serious post, but I could not help but laugh at the methods you use.  Excellent tactics.  \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA", "This is on your parents to fix, no matter what your aunt is going through, she can\u2019t put others around her in a burdened state. She still has to be a parent, it rough, but that\u2019s life. Your parents not making this is issue is so sad, and you are literally tutoring. If this doesn\u2019t work, can you tutor elsewhere?", "nta at all", "the way they treat you would be enough to get them fined in many countries.\n\nprivacy is extremely important and they don't value yours.\n\nyour parents are shit and you are NTA", "Your parents are the AH.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**you are great. You manage your AH parents well.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My parents told me I was being mean to children whose parents just divorced and I should be ashamed \" .. **YOUR parents should be ashamed** how they treat THEIR OWN kid.", "NTA - this is brilliant and well thought out.  I can see why you are a tutor to your peers.  Well done, OP.  Well done!", "Nta. And may I say that was quite a smart solution.", "They're failing everybody! They're failing aunt Savannah and they're failing the kids! Treating somebody with kindness and tiptoeing around them are two different things! They keep this up and these are going to be the kind of kids who turn into little hellions because nobody wants to say anything to them because \"divorce is hard!\" Experience: my cousin was like 12 when his mom died. For years everybody just caved to anything he wanted because his mom died \"he has it so hard\". My dad died 2 years later and my mom refused to let them do that stuff with me and my siblings. We are all well adjusted all these years later, cousin still lives with his daddy... He's got to be in his late 40s. Just does not take responsibility for anything.", "I think she should start tutoring somewhere else like a library or a coffee shop so she's not there as often to be a meat shield so the parents don't have to care for the annoying kids.  The banging on the door is probably frightening for the people she's tutoring (this is bringing back memories of my own parents doing the same thing, shudder).\n\nThe rest of the time, if the banging doesn't bother her, she needs to just lock the door.  Eventually her dad will get sick of harassing her to do her aunt's job and hopefully start making the aunt do her own job.\n\nDivorce sucks but it doesn't mean life stops.  People still have responsibilities and adult tasks.", "Lol that reminds me of how people will keep their dogs out of certain rooms by putting a vacuum cleaner in the doorway!", "Nailed it. They want OP to keep the kids busy so the \"adults\" don't have to do the actual adulting. Which I find disgusting. The same parents are the ones wondering on Reddit why their children went LC or NC as soon as they could get out from under their thumb.", "8 and 10? I thought they were 4 or 5 years old.  8 and 10 old are enough to understand basic rules. \n\nAnd if it's not a \"problem\" to deal with them why aren't your parents be the good aunt and uncle and take care of them?", "It's so weird to me as someone who\u2019s also been through a divorce.  Like yeah, I felt like shit and I was on a boatload of antidepressants to cope.  But my responsibilities didn't evaporate, I still had to go to work and do chores and take care of my pets.  I had financial stress because I was suddenly paying more bills than I had before.  But I had to just shoulder through it.  I didn't have the luxury of living rent free in someone else's house and ignoring my obligations.", "Aunt and OPs parents are most likely telling the kids to go find OP because they don\u2019t want to be bothered", "This is potentially an excellent riff on Baby Goes to College.", "But why?", "It's control. This kind of control is more normalized in severe Christian households in the US. My parents didn't like locked doors either. The excuse was that we might have an accident that needed medical attention and could die if we locked a door.", "Reach out to the group you're volunteering for with your tutoring.  They may be able to arrange for you to do it somewhere else, and then you would be out of the house entirely.\n\nNTA.  These are not your kids and you are not obligated to entertain or babysit them.  You should also be able to lock your door if they can't learn to knock.", "I would do tutoring at school if possible. And or have a teacher talk to your parents.", "You can buy an untuneable ukulele from 5 Below. Remember, if your goal is to annoy, you don\u2019t really need lessons, you can just start making sounds immediately.", "That's when you take the little bastard somewhere private and beat the crap out of him. If mom and dad find out it will be worse and will continue until he behaves.", "I didn\u2019t even give a description. On what base are you saying that it is just accepted?", "Idk they just want to keep an eye on us. If parents do something, in India, you just get used to not even asking them about it and just get used to it.

My parents give me evasive answers and I\u2019ve just given up on asking them for answers. I am Christian but I wouldn\u2019t call it severely Christianised as I need to go to Sunday mass compulsory but on other days it\u2019s my choice.", "Yup. I owned a tutoring business for five years. Tutoring at the library - even online - was quite common.", "This situation is just crazy to me.  Getting divorced sucks but it doesn't disable you.  When mine was going on, I was severely clinically depressed, like my doctor maxed me out on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds.  It was incredibly stressful.  I was in one of the lowest places in my life.\n\nBut like...I still went to work.  I still had to earn money because I suddenly had to pay more bills than I used to.  I still had to care for my pets.  My adult responsibilities didn't cease just because my marriage did.\n\nEither the aunt is so depressed that she needs crisis level mental health care because she can't be responsible for her minor children, or she's using the divorce as a crutch to get free babysitting when she's living rent free in someone else's house.", "Masturbation. They think they are preventing us from masturbating. We can hear them coming up the hall. We masturbate over our clothes. We have broken the code people.

LOL", "I didn\u2019t understand what you said. Could you explain?", "I never locked my bedroom door.\n\nNot because I wasn't allowed to, but bc I had an agreement with my parents that none of us would enter other people's bedroom without knocking first - except when it was time to wake up and the alarm clock was going on for a while, my dad had to enter the bedroom to awake me (usually by grabbing my toe or shaking my ankle a bit).\n\nWhen the rooms were empty, going in was allowed, but snooping inside private drawers was not.", "Same way I used to play roblox when I was in 7th during covid", "Ah ok."]}
