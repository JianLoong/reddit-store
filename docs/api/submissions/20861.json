It is also your parents' responsibility to fend for your rights and space in your household and manage the rest of the household to make room for you and your needs and obligations.\n\nYour parents are dropping the ball big time in this situation and seem to be trying to make you take care of the younger children so they can slack off in that department.

Not only are you right that both you and the person you tutor deserve to have an uninterrupted session, but what they are allowing to happen is rude regardless of what activity you are doing.  The adults don't seem to care about your established boundary, and giving you that level of independence and respect is necessary for anyone, especially if you're still underage.  Good on you for finding a non-harmful and creative solution.\n\nAlternatively, I don't know if this will work depending on their ages, but perhaps you can see if a different approach might appease your parents while still maintaining your boundary.  It seems to me like the kids may be barging in because they really like your company, so finding a way to reward the kids when they listen to your sign and refrain from entering might go a long way towards not only making everyone happy, but also teach the kids about respecting boundaries in the process.  The reward need not be a physical object either.  They would probably find you spending some time with them after your sessions doing something fun for a little while as a good trade.  You could start the reward system before removing the spider decoys and once they start responding to it, start removing spiders.", "NTA.
