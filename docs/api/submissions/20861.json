You could lock it anyway and just let your parents bang on the door until they get tired of it. \n\nThis is such a violation.

You are NTA for getting creative with setting up boundaries", "NTA It's actually very similar to what I (m20ish at the time)  did to my niece when I babysat her. She was scared of skulls, and I got tired of chasing her over a baby gate (she climbed everything) and up the stairs. I got a resin skull and placed it on the other side of the gate.

Your parents are not helping your aunt to not get depressed, they are helping her to not discipline her kids, and teach them to be respectful.

Are they (unmedicated) ADHD by chance? Being that age and barging in on you either makes me think they seriously lack any impulse control and/or they are purposely doing it as an attention-seeking behavior, which makes sense with a mom going through divorce and dad being gone. (Any attention is good attention to them at this point) They need some counseling/therapy. What happens if you ignore them when they come in? Do they get in your face and scream and such?", "NTA- quietly move all the spiders around and periodically put some of them away and then bring them out again. And when the kids ask why be shocked that they had moved and tell them you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Just like elf on the shelf.", "Honestly, OP, you may need to look outside for a way to escape everyone there. If you can, make yourself real busy.", "You might want to try going to your local library instead!", "That or tell the adults that she's not their mom and that she shouldn't be raising them when her mom is failing in that department.", "Reasoned argument isn't going to do it; their Plan A has to be shown to be failing. If she likes, this can be ones of the things she yells, however.\n\nIf she tries to reason, they'll just pull rank and ignore it.", "Another plan would involve snakes and spiders."]}
