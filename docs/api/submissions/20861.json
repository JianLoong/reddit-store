It is also your parents' responsibility to fend for your rights and space in your household and manage the rest of the household to make room for you and your needs and obligations.\n\nYour parents are dropping the ball big time in this situation and seem to be trying to make you take care of the younger children so they can slack off in that department.

The adults don't seem to care about your established boundary, and giving you that level of independence and respect is necessary for anyone, especially if you're still underage.  Good on you for finding a non-harmful and creative solution.\n\nAlternatively, I don't know if this will work depending on their ages, but perhaps you can see if a different approach might appease your parents while still maintaining your boundary.  It seems to me like the kids may be barging in because they really like your company, so finding a way to reward the kids when they listen to your sign and refrain from entering might go a long way towards not only making everyone happy, but also teach the kids about respecting boundaries in the process.  The reward need not be a physical object either.  They would probably find you spending some time with them after your sessions doing something fun for a little while as a good trade.  You could start the reward system before removing the spider decoys and once they start responding to it, start removing spiders.", "NTA.

Tough shit, put your hands all over everything.          \nAlone time? Barge in and sit somewhere awkwardly.         \nMovie time? Watch YouTube shorts and TikTok videos loudly.          \nDinner? Fart at the table.         \nAlso just walk into their room from now on like you own the place. If they lock it, bang on the door until they open it and question why it's locked.          \nYou need to be difficult with difficult people.", "All the adults are letting down all the children in this scenario", "NTA.\n\nBut I fear your cousins will overcome their fear of the fake spiders and then your problem will be back.\n\n>My parents also don\u2019t let me lock my door unless I\u2019m getting dressed. \n\nYou have to work on changing this situation somehow. Why are your parents so obsessed with you having your door open nearly all the time?", "You're NTA. You tried all the reasonable routes and you were repeatedly ignored. Good job on your creative solution to a problem that could have been easily solved by the adults enforcing some basic manners.", "NTA. Good for you for coming up with a creative solution to your problem.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a bit shitty that your parents never let you lock your door. I mean, if you have like a gf or bf in there that\u2019s one thing, but it is perfectly reasonable for someone to lock their door so that anyone will knock before entering.", "Your parents are TA, they totally suck.", "NTA. Your parents are overcompensating for your Aunt and not respecting your right to privacy. No one is helping those kids by letting them do whatever they want without boundaries or limits. It is even likely they are misbehaving to get their mothers attention. Your parents and your aunt need to open their eyes; divorce isn't an excuse to stop parenting your children.", "Why can't my kid keep a job? Oh because we taught them jobs aren't important because wahhh we're assholes. \n\n>My parents told me I was being mean to children whose parents just divorced and I should be ashamed with myself for purposely scaring them instead of being more patient\n\nYour parents are assholes. They moved three people in. These people are not your responsibility. You should have your tutoring time respected. Your solution was great. They're mad they can't dump your cousins on you constantly. That's it. NTA.", "NTA, everyone else in the house is though!", "NTA. I\u2019d ask your parents who\u2019s relationship will be more important to them in 20 years their kid who will have kids and a family of their own or their nephews. It\u2019s clear your getting the short end of the stick and they need to do better", "NTA\n\nyou came up with a creative solution when none of the adults wanted to step in. They can't use the divorce as an excuse for you not to need any privacy. That's how you create entitled brats.", "Your parents are assholes \nYour aunt is an asshole too \nThe kids should be entertained by their parents not you OP", "NTA\nPeople need to learn how to respect boundaries and this should come from the adults. If using fake spiders works then crack on.\nPersonally I would go further and change the latch on your door for one that can be locked from the inside with a thumbturn (a lot of them can simply be changed with a screwdriver). That way you can physically prevent access to your room when you need to- only issue is that it won't prevent noise(but that can be dealt with by use of a headset).", "Absolutely weird that door-locking is not allowed. I'm wondering if OP is even allowed to put a password for their phone lockscreen.", ">But hey, if they would rather pay more for college\u2026\n\nTHIS. They're probably spending more on bills with the added people living there now, so what's a few extra thousands for college? \n\nI'd be roaming the house gushing about how great it is that I don't have to do honor work anymore or worry about scholarships because my parents will pay for full tuition! /s", "No, the kids will tell the parents OP said that. She has to be craftier. She has some candy or very minty gum that can be smelled 10 feet away. She steps into the parents room and then opens the candy, walks toward the door and puts the candy in her mouth wjere the kids see/smell it. When the kids ask for some \"I don't have any of my own\" while throwing a thumb towards the parents room. If the kids try to throw OP under the bus, she cn say \"noo when you asked for some I told you that I had none of my own.\"", ">It seems to me like the kids may be barging in because they really like your company\n\nOr the exact opposite. They're bored and upsetting OP is funny.", "Well, now the feature includes bugs!", "If it's that, then OP should absolutely keep the spiders because if upsetting OP is funny, then turnabout is fair play.", "And the dad coming banging on the door, even if OP has a tutoring session going on. That's so disrespectful. They demand OP be respectful while not respecting OP back, I hate that bs. Respect is a two-way street!", "I wasn't even allowed to close my bedroom door growing up. Only the bathroom door.", "Just because it's accepted doesn't mean it's normal. I do not know anything about Indian culture though", "NTA. u/MeanToCousins ,\nYou are the only \u201cadult\u201d in the house.\n\nI\u2019m a parent. This is shameful how all 3 adults are handling this situation. All of them are failing at \u201cadulting\u201d , especially setting reasonable boundaries while Aunt & cousins are living with you. I\u2019m livid over how you are not being treated with respect.\n\nThe spiders are a brilliant solution. (Congratulations on your Honor Society work\u2026 that\u2019s a big deal, IMO! Are your tutoring sessions online? Woukd you be able to go elsewhere for them? At least get a break from the chaos at home?)\n\nI\u2019m sorry you are being made the \u201cbad guy\u201d . I would never allow this behavior in my home. I would have stepped in on day one, explaining to Aunt & boys this is not acceptable. Doesn\u2019t seem like the boys have ever had discipline or boundaries.", "This is straight up child abuse. It's unbelievable. WTAF is wrong with your parents.", "That was my first thought too, you are not likely to get the adults to change so best would be to find somewhere else to work", "They weren't my parents. My mum died and my dad was denied custody simply because he was a man so my aunt and uncle had custody of me until I was 14 and said no more and moved in with my dad.", "In a situation like that you should just have a door barge thing so you are able to get in, but you have to weigh it against a broken door, so you only use it as a last resort. Just what I came up with in my head, I'm no parent", "Part of me wants to send more.\n\nLoad their beds with spiders. Launch tarantulas at them if they open her door."]}
