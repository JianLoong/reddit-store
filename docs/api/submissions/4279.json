The two coffee makers would be the first thought (and was)", "French press coffee makers are easy - scoop coffee in ( mine had 2, partner at the time had 1). Boil enough water to fill up both pressers. They aren\u2019t expensive ($20-40) and the taste is so much better\u2026", "Two simple solutions:\n1) Boil water in the kettle, add water to a splash of her coffee.\n2) Buy a second coffeemaker. They\u2019re like $30.", "For real \u2014 you can buy a mediocre coffeemaker for like $20.", "She moved in, so if she really wants a coffee maker of her own, she can buy her own damn coffee pot.", "He had to get rid of it because it threatened his dominance", "I'd go with ESH. OP refusing to dilute, and gf insisting on using OP's coffee pot ( which OP already uses) are both too childish for N A H.", "Why does she get the new one? Both of them are equally at fault.", "I like this idea.  If you do it, OP, be careful though.  Buying an appliance for one's SO as a holiday/birthday gift can be pretty touchy.  It needs to **very** clear that this is so she can make her coffee the way she likes it, and not that it's a tool she needs to maintain and is always responsible for.  \n\n\nI'm tired, so my point may not be getting across clearly enough, but reddit is probably littered with the bodies of men that have bought their wives vacuum cleaners and washing machines as \"Christmas gifts.\"  Don't be one of those guys.", "This seems like such an easy solution lol", "Seriously. Walmart or Amazon has them for $20.", "Well op did make the big stink it was theirs first", "Because the comment you replied to suggested getting her a coffee machine as an Xmas gift? That's... how gifting works.", "People will tell you it\u2019s because American outlets are 110 Volts vs the European 220 Volts so it takes kettles longer to boil, but in reality it\u2019s just that Americans drink less tea.", "Omfg. I make cowboy coffee sometimes, half bc I'm lazy, half because I actually kind of like it. \n\nI hope we're talking about the same thing. It's what I call tossing grounds into a baby sauce pot of boiling water for a bit and filtering it into a cup.", "I mean he already has one but sure", "I mean I have one that you use on the stove but I'm weird\n\nAnd I drink tea \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah, an American who drinks tea once a week is probably a heavier tea drinker than like 90% of Americans, very not worth it for most Americans to buy a kettle.", "Probably so put one on the kitchen table or coffee table.\n\n*edit spelling", "Lol, I know this is a good way to deal with two coffee makers, but I still find it irrationally upsetting that there would be a coffee maker on either of those places.", "Because she is moving into his house and using his coffee pot.\n\nI can guarantee you that if the genders were reversed, everyone would be enraged that OP's partner is so domineering over a simple coffee maker.", "More appropriate to say 'my coffee pot, my rules',", "No, everyone wouldn't. Because strong coffee can very easily be diluted by adding water, whereas weak coffee can't be made stronger. It's like when people have irreconcilable differences regarding the thermostat: people who are cold can always add more layers, but people who are hot can strip down to nothing and still be miserably hot, so the hot person wins. OP can dilute his gf's coffee without difficulty, so that's what he should do.\n\n(I would note that this is exactly what millions of people around the world do every day with tea. In many countries, it is standard practice to boil water, pour it into a small teapot with a lot of tea leaves, and just leave it there all day. When they want to drink some tea, they boil more water, pour a little strong tea into a teacup, then add hot water until it's diluted to their taste", "Yep. Man's footing the bill for the house. Least she can do is to buy her own coffee pot."]}
