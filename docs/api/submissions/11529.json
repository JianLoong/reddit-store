That is beyond wrong and feels exceptionally condescending.", "NTA\n\nThe MIL and SIL are totally assholes.\n\nHow adults speak gets woven into children. You are totally correct to prevent her from speaking curses over your child (and yourself too, who accuses someone of 'trapping' their son but  a total asshole).\n\nKeep up the solid parenting.

My grandmother hated my dad and blamed both my parents because of it. My parents would ship us all off to their house for most of the summer, either to get a break from parenting and/ or because of their deluded need to play happy family pretend time. \n\nMy grandmother spent hours every day yelling and lecturing me about everything anyone in our family had done to upset her. I had older siblings, but they just ran off and left me to be verbally abused. I heard all about how they hated my dad. And how my mom was a bad daughter for taking his side over theirs. And how I was bad because I was a messy eater when I was a baby. What a homely baby I had been. How my sister was perfect because my grandmother picked her up once as a baby, and she didn't cry. How my parents abandoned my mom's disabled brother to live on the street. On and on and on. I'd cry and beg not to go back, and my family would laugh and make fun of me for being a homesick mommy's baby.\n\nSo anyway, please protect your child from these people.
