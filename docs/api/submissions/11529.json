I\n\nAbsolutely not. If your daughter is actually precious to her, then MIL can apologize and stop calling her things like a bitch and a pain in the ass. It is perfectly acceptable for you to not want insults to be used as \"terms of endearment,\" *especially* for a literal baby. Who calls a baby a bitch, even if they claim it's \"affectionate.\" Just.... ew. NTA.", "NTA. What is wrong with this person??", "WOW. You're NTA at all. Your MIL seems very unhinged.  She probably did that on purpose because of what you told her before.  She was expecting your husband to let her get away with it.  Guess not. I wouldn't let her alone with the baby, ever..", "Haha hell no NTA. If your SIL is so upset she can give her trashy mother some home training. Who calls a baby that???", "MIL... say hello to my little friend consequences. \n\nShe chose to learn the hard way. That was her choice. \n\nNTA", "NTA!", "NTA.  Not sure what your MIL's play was here considering that you asked her not to swear. I'm assuming she wants to be seen as the victim in this situation and your SIL is playing along with that.", "NTA.", "NTA and good on you for defending your daughter from this ghastly woman. Stand your ground!", "Yeah, you are NTA at all. You can speak like that to pets but a child who is actively learning how to speak? No! That is beyond wrong and feels exceptionally condescending.", "NTA\n\nThe MIL and SIL are totally assholes.\n\nHow adults speak gets woven into children. You are totally correct to prevent her from speaking curses over your child (and yourself too, who accuses someone of 'trapping' their son but  a total asshole).\n\nKeep up the solid parenting.
