After I get them pulled I\u2019ll be coming down from the medicine they give you and I\u2019ll be unable to care for my kids. My youngest\u2019s dad lives very close to us and hasn\u2019t met her and wants to do so. He\u2019s yet to meet her bc he\u2019s with a drug addict and refuses to leave her. I was thinking about asking him to come to my home and care for her until I come down from the meds. After I come done go back to no contact with him bc I do not want a drug addict or drugs around my child and he refuses to leave her. So WIBTA?\n\nEdit: He hasn\u2019t seen her bc he wants to leave with her and take her around his gf aka the addict. I have a roommate that\u2019s not responsible enough to watch kids but can prevent him from leaving with them and him bring others over.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for commenting about care.com. I found a few potential people. I\u2019ll definitely be using this instead. I didn\u2019t know anything about it. I absolutely love it. I can read reviews about what people think about them and their work.

This is a bad plan. Like really bad. Like child neglect and getting the rest of your meds stolen kind of bad.\n\nHire a babysitter or ask a friend or coworker.", "Dude.\n\nThis isn't a WIBTA situation. This is a big risk you're taking. Unsafe. You're really that short in options?\n\nWhat makes you think he wouldn't bring a drug addict with him or then later he wants to be around more often?", "Hire a babysitter.  It'll be less emotionally expensive in the long run. Beyond anything do you want to risk your children with a drug addict *in the same building as your post-surgery painkillers* ?\n\n(Edited...too many typos to stay awake)", "YTA yes and if so concerned about his connections then willingly putting your kids at risk. Also that's how you want them to first meet? Hire a babysitter would be a way better option. Or asking a friend. This screams of not a good idea at all.", "YTA you're using him to baby sit his kid that you refuse to let him meet because he's a danger but are ok with using him when it's convenient for you? What happened to him being to dangerous to meet his kid? This is super manipulative if he's  not dangerous and very dangerous for your kids if he is.", "YTA hire a sitter.", "YWBTA. If someone is dangerous enough for you to not want them around your child in even a supervised setting while you're perfectly sober, it would be incredibly negligent to have them around your child in a setting while you're coming off surgical drugs.\n\nSo either he's not as dangerous as you claim he is, in which case you're an asshole for not allowing supervised visits, or you'd be a terrible parent for letting him around your child while you're not perfectly alert.", "YWBTA Find a babysitter. There are actual apps for that. [Care.com](https://Care.com) is one. Don't give him a taste of fatherhood just to yank it away.", "Edit as questions answered: worried YWBTA. You do have options, even if they might be difficult. Hire a reputable sitter, ask a friend, call your family and see if they can make arrangements even if they\u2019re states away, drop in daycare, etc. I\u2019m concerned you\u2019d lose your protective order if you willingly allowed him in the house because while it sounds like the order is against his gf, you cannot be sure gf won\u2019t get in. You also need care after getting your wisdom teeth taken out, so you need to consider yourself too. You\u2019ll need someone to drive you, someone to give you your medicine in the recommended dosage, someone to make sure you don\u2019t accidentally hurt yourself by eating food you\u2019re not supposed to. Getting put under for this is a real surgery and you really do need someone to help not just your kids, but you. \n\nInfo: do you have anyone else that can help? Like, literally anyone else that you haven\u2019t had to go NC with? Because if you do ask him, you won\u2019t be able to get him back out of your life very easily and it doesn\u2019t sound like you trust him. Why would you want him around your kids if you don\u2019t trust him? He\u2019s not in recovery, he\u2019s an active addict (unless i misread something) so\u2026why would he be safe to watch your kids?", "Yes YWBTA for having someone who has a reputation you do not approve of watch your children, and then cutting off contact.", "YTA - HOLY COW, YES! What do you think being able to see dad, then have him yanked away, will do to your kid? The utter selfishness here us mind-blowing.", "Is this really your best option?", "You would be putting yourself in a bad situation. How do you know he wouldn\u2019t take your post op meds.

I would rather die than leave my child with someone that is virtually a fucking STRANGER to them. You\u2019re gross. And yes YTA, you\u2019re the queen of assholes in fact.

And you're putting your children in danger doing that as well if he's with a drug addict. Ask reliable family or a friend for help. Not your dead beat baby dad.", "I read several comments saying OP will be on some opioids. Is that normal in the US? When my son got all four wisdom teeth pulled the dentist told him to take some Ibuprofen and he was fine. I\u2018m always interested in how things are done in different countries."]}
