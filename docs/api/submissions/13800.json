Did you assume that your daughter would be fine with caring for a child? Why?

That is an awful excuse to get unpaid labour out of her. No kid should be forced into practicing for that. \n\nEven the room situation sucks for her. Kids do need to accept it, if they don't get a room to themselves, but it doesn't mean it wasn't really hard for her and she didn't feel like she was losing something important and personal to her.

The soon she will have her own kids is such a load of crap, your daughter in law sucks for even saying that.
