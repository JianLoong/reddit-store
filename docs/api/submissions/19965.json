{"id": 19965, "submission_id": "14cf7hi", "title": "AITA for snapping at my brother and telling him his Reddit moderating isn\u2019t a real job?", "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I'm really frustrated with my brother right now, and I need some perspective. \n\nHere's the situation: My brother (let's call him Alex) graduated from college a couple of years ago and has been struggling to find a job in his field ever since. I completely understand that it can be challenging, and I've tried to be supportive by helping him with his resume, networking, and job searching. However, he seems to have given up on the idea of finding a paid job altogether.\n\nInstead, Alex spends most of his time on Reddit, moderating a large sports subreddit that he frequents. He claims that it's a valuable experience and that it will eventually open up opportunities for him. While I appreciate his enthusiasm for community management and his dedication, I can't help but feel frustrated by his lack of financial responsibility.\n\nI've tried explaining to Alex that he needs a paying job to sustain himself and build a stable future. I worry about his financial security and his ability to support himself in the long run. He dismisses my concerns and insists that he's building a reputation and gaining valuable skills through his job (as he refers to it) as a moderator.\n\nTo make matters worse, our parents are enabling his behavior. They think that being tough with him will only cause him to withdraw from life even more. He's living rent-free at our parents' house, not contributing to household expenses, and spending most of his time on Reddit. Meanwhile, I'm working hard at a full-time job to support myself and contribute my fair share.\n\nI'm getting increasingly frustrated because it seems like Alex is not even trying to find a job anymore. Whenever I bring up the topic, he gets defensive and accuses me of not understanding his passion. It's causing a lot of tension between us, and I'm starting to resent him for his lack of effort.\n\nThings finally came to a head today. The subreddit he moderates decided to participate in the protests that are occurring and shut down for about a week. When they came back online, the users of the subreddit were extremely hostile. They didn\u2019t care about the protests and were upset that they had missed the chance to discuss some major events in the sport. I came in to the house to find him on the couch with his laptop, so angry he was literally yelling at the screen. I asked him what was wrong and he said \u201chis users\u201d were being ungrateful and ignorant. I finally snapped and told him that his \u201cjob\u201d was meaningless and that he needed to find real work. He just glared at me and walked back to his room, slamming the door behind him.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for getting angry at my brother for refusing to get a job in favor of working for free as a Reddit moderator? I just want him to be financially responsible and contribute to our household like any adult should.", "created_utc": 1687077185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cf7hi/aita_for_snapping_at_my_brother_and_telling_him/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's on your parents \ud83e\udd37 move out and live your own life\n\nP.S. the whole \"protest\" makes little sense to me coz who cares that AI can't be trained for FREE to earn smb else (not reddit) money and several \"interface\" apps can't earn money out of air, by demonstrating reddit's content?)))

Is this a repost??", "Worth adding - if he's graduated with a college degree and is screaming at his laptop because of Reddit, then maybe a reality check is long overdue.
