It was just another way to abuse you. And any 'friends' who say you were wrong, are  not really friends!", "NTA\nEven setting aside the abuse (which imho means he isn't entitled to a normal level of consideration) he was using you financially, impacting your credit rating, and being an inconsiderate ass. \n2 and a half freaking years! Even watching an ex's Netflix, six months is too long \nGlad you got out of that relationship BTW", "NTA.  Nothing solves a problem faster than shutting down someones internet.", "NTA - You shut down something that you absolutely shouldn't have to pay for that could impact your credit rating etc.\n\nHowever I will add something OP. You refer to this person as your abuser and state that you didn't want to engage with them hence why you didn't wait for a response. Why message them asking why'd they'd keep you on the internet account then if you didn't wanna engage. I'm not gonna victim blame but it's interesting that for someone you're saying you want to actively avoid you'd message them first.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t need to give him any warning before shutting the account. You need better friends than the ones who are suggesting you did something wrong.", "NTA and ditch the friends that are saying you are.\n\nYou attempted to contact him and gave him a couple of days to respond. This is a situation he should have taken care of years ago.", "NTA", "NTA. What he did was shady...you don't owe him a few days...as soon as you found out you should have spoken with BT and cancelled.", "You're nta but your ex and some of your friends are wtf.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And I don't see how anyone feels different. It's not your responsibility to financially support anyone but yourself.

Sounds like he deserves it regardless. Good on you. but NTA", "NTA in the slightest.", "NTA\n\nHe knew what he was doing and you reached out on multiple levels. I'm just glad the company listened and adjusted it. He was screwing up your credit history and he didn't care.", "NTA. Dude had 2.5 years to get his shit together.", "NTA\n\nYou messaged him and he didn't answer.  You put a message on his FB and he didn't answer, so your next step was to get that bill put into his name.  Plus you said he is an emotional abuser and this was another way to abuse you more.  You did the right thing.", "ESH - him for doing what he did and you because your story doesn't add up.", "You're absolutely right. I still feel a bit bad but I guess  that's also remnants of trauma.", "I wanted to try and be an adult and give the benefit of a doubt but I guess I shouldn't have.", "Thank you. Apparently some people think my story doesn't make sense and I'm doubting myself even more now.", "Probably a \"people pleaser\" part of you, so i get that. You are doing the right thing. its been years you dont owe him anything. You tried to reach out and it went unanswered", "Hold up though. You first messaged him and confirmed that he'd read the message.\nYou then decided to post on his fb wall about it, a distinctly un-adult thing to do when someone leaves you on read.\nBy all accounts it sounds like he doesn't wanna engage with you and you're childishly forcing him to. Again, not denying the abuse but your story doesn't quite add up.", "Please don't doubt yourself.  You did what needed to be done and now it's over for good.

Go through and check all your other accounts", ">A few of my friends are suggesting I may be TA for not simply waiting for his response\n\nWhat? You don't have to wait for anything. NTA.

Its been taken from his bank card.", "I'm sorry you had to go through it too. Very stressful", "> Apparently some people think my story doesn't make sense and I'm doubting myself even more now.\n\nThe part that doesn't make sense *to them* is why you'd go out of your way to try to be nice to someone who abused you. It does make sense, because you're trying to be nice and mature and all that... but you need to take care of yourself first and simply stop worrying what he might think.", "If you're running up a tab in my name, you don't get to cry harassment when I try to reach out to you about it. \n\nIf he wants to completely disengage from her, he needs to disengage his utilities from her bank account first.", "NTA and you did the right thing and giving them his information\u2026", "NTA what possible response could he give that would change the situation at all? It literally doesn't matter why, you did what needed to be done no matter what.", "NTA. Your fault, to yourself, for not finalizing all of your bills. Always keep track of billing and legal contract that's under your name. It could seriously screw you over with collection and credits history. No way you're TA for changing the billing to the correct name. He was never going to change it because it has already been 3 years!", "NTA- The people who said that to you are not your friends. Are they normally like this?\n\nI know you don\u2019t live in the country anymore, but if you had plans to come back within six years, it would also have hurt your credit. You are completely in the right.", "NTA. His response would have been some form of \"you should pay it\". You avoided the argument. He shouldn't have done it in the first place.", "NTA", "Absolutely you should have waited for a reply from the man who repeatedly punched you in the face emotionally during your relationship with him. After all, you only tried to contact him several times by the means at your disposal /s\n\nWhat is the matter with your friends? Were they born stupid or have they been working on their skills?\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "NTA this was definitely intentional and he was never going to respond. You have some crappy friends, taking the side of your abuser.", "NTA. Dude knew what he was doing that's why he ignored you.", "NTA. I wouldn't have messaged him. I'd have just canceled it and made sure he got the bill", "Don't feel bad in any way! Your friends are idiots for thinking you could be the asshole in any way even ignoring the abusive relationship.", "yep. refusing and witholding the contact they've made necessary is in fact an emotionally abusive tactic.\n\nso give him what he's telling you he wants. he's a nonentity to be worked around, with contact as sparing and minimal as possible. nothing emotional or involved about it; that gives him a chance to ensnare you back in.", "That\u2019s exactly what it is.  He\u2019s continuing to act in an indirectly abusive manner to you.  F\u00a5\u20ack that shit.  And please check all other previous accounts while with him, and check on your credit to see that all else is as it should be.  NTA, of course.", "You gave him a couple of days after sending a message with no reply. It takes 30 seconds to reply. Definitely NTA. You did way more than you should have.", "I had an ex try to do this and in no way are you the AH.", "what's childish about protecting your credit by the means he's made necessary?\n\nhe made a situation where his engagement was a matter of her wellbeing. regarding his actions as his and addressing it as such forces him to stop being immature and take responsibility. there's nothing childish about it."]}
