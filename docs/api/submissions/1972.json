But this is years later", "Yo - NTA in anyway. \n\nHe was going to let that company keep charging you/sending you fees. He didn't respect you enough to tell you. Screw that", ">A few of my friends are suggesting I may be TA for not simply waiting for his response\n\nIt's been 2.5 years.  He knew exactly what he was doing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It was just another way to abuse you. And any 'friends' who say you were wrong, are  not really friends!", "NTA\nEven setting aside the abuse (which imho means he isn't entitled to a normal level of consideration) he was using you financially, impacting your credit rating, and being an inconsiderate ass. \n2 and a half freaking years! Even watching an ex's Netflix, six months is too long \nGlad you got out of that relationship BTW", "NTA.  Nothing solves a problem faster than shutting down someones internet.", "NTA - You shut down something that you absolutely shouldn't have to pay for that could impact your credit rating etc.\n\nHowever I will add something OP. You refer to this person as your abuser and state that you didn't want to engage with them hence why you didn't wait for a response. Why message them asking why'd they'd keep you on the internet account then if you didn't wanna engage. I'm not gonna victim blame but it's interesting that for someone you're saying you want to actively avoid you'd message them first.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t need to give him any warning before shutting the account. You need better friends than the ones who are suggesting you did something wrong.", "NTA and ditch the friends that are saying you are.\n\nYou attempted to contact him and gave him a couple of days to respond. This is a situation he should have taken care of years ago.", "NTA", "NTA. What he did was shady...you don't owe him a few days...as soon as you found out you should have spoken with BT and cancelled.", "You're nta but your ex and some of your friends are wtf.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And I don't see how anyone feels different. It's not your responsibility to financially support anyone but yourself.

Sounds like he deserves it regardless. Good on you. but NTA", "NTA in the slightest.", "NTA\n\nHe knew what he was doing and you reached out on multiple levels. I'm just glad the company listened and adjusted it. He was screwing up your credit history and he didn't care.", "NTA. Dude had 2.5 years to get his shit together.", "NTA\n\nYou messaged him and he didn't answer.  You put a message on his FB and he didn't answer, so your next step was to get that bill put into his name.  Plus you said he is an emotional abuser and this was another way to abuse you more.  You did the right thing.", "ESH - him for doing what he did and you because your story doesn't add up.", "You're absolutely right. I still feel a bit bad but I guess  that's also remnants of trauma.", "I wanted to try and be an adult and give the benefit of a doubt but I guess I shouldn't have.", "Thank you. Apparently some people think my story doesn't make sense and I'm doubting myself even more now.", "Probably a \"people pleaser\" part of you, so i get that. You are doing the right thing. its been years you dont owe him anything. You tried to reach out and it went unanswered", "Hold up though. You first messaged him and confirmed that he'd read the message.\nYou then decided to post on his fb wall about it, a distinctly un-adult thing to do when someone leaves you on read.\nBy all accounts it sounds like he doesn't wanna engage with you and you're childishly forcing him to. Again, not denying the abuse but your story doesn't quite add up.", "Please don't doubt yourself.  You did what needed to be done and now it's over for good.  Get this fool out your head and move on with your life."]}
