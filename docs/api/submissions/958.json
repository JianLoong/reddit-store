We had a very contentious divorce and ex is always trying to screw me over, including telling my daughter lies about me and trying to turn her against me. My ex has primary custody where I just get evenings and weekends. Despite my best efforts to bond with my daughter, she's way closer to her mother and it's a bit painful for me. We've always been somewhat distant, and she misbehaves and is lazy with her homework. She's also on her phone a lot, even when I try to talk to her. I've thought about trying to take my ex to court for full custody of my daughter, but I feel like my daughter might choose her in the end and it would all be for nothing.\n\nSometimes my daughter tells me that my ex says hurtful things to her, and that she's not happy living there. But she's never once said she wanted to live with me. I tried to nudge her into saying it, but she hasn't, which really hurt me. So the last time she told me about a big fight they had, I told her it was her choice to stay there, and she could leave. She didn't say anything to that.\n\nAfter thinking about it, I thought it might be better if she stopped sleeping over at my house, since she has roots with her mother and it's clear to me they have the closer, better relationship. Besides, if her life with her mother was so bad, why hasn't she said she wanted to live with me? My wife agrees with me. But lately my daughter hasn't spoken to me much, she's more quiet than usual and it makes me wonder if I did the right thing?

We had a very contentious divorce and ex is always trying to screw me over, including telling my daughter lies about me and trying to turn her against me. My ex has primary custody where I just get evenings and weekends. Despite my best efforts to bond with my daughter, she's way closer to her mother and it's a bit painful for me. We've always been somewhat distant, and she misbehaves and is lazy with her homework. She's also on her phone a lot, even when I try to talk to her. I've thought about trying to take my ex to court for full custody of my daughter, but I feel like my daughter might choose her in the end and it would all be for nothing.\n\nSometimes my daughter tells me that my ex says hurtful things to her, and that she's not happy living there. But she's never once said she wanted to live with me. I tried to nudge her into saying it, but she hasn't, which really hurt me. So the last time she told me about a big fight they had, I told her it was her choice to stay there, and she could leave. She didn't say anything to that.\n\nAfter thinking about it, I thought it might be better if she stopped sleeping over at my house, since she has roots with her mother and it's clear to me they have the closer, better relationship. Besides, if her life with her mother was so bad, why hasn't she said she wanted to live with me? My wife agrees with me. But lately my daughter hasn't spoken to me much, she's more quiet than usual and it makes me wonder if I did the right thing? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have always had a very strong relationship with my mother, and lived with her primarily, only seeing my father the same amount as you see your daughter. Because of this, like your daughter, I have a much stronger relationship with my mom and we are very close.\n\nLike any daughter, I wanted a strong relationship with my father, but it was always very awkward, cordial, and distant. I had a lot of animosity when I was your daughters age towards my father because of this. You have to remember, 14-year-olds are awkward, and don\u2019t know how to quite control or formulate their emotions. But I can promise you, all your daughter wants is to be accepted by you, even if they don\u2019t show it. \n\nI am 26 now, and a few years ago I was tired of the relationship I had with my father, so I went to see him to tell him that I hated the fact we we acted like strangers and I wanted to know why. He responded with \u201c I feel the same way, I gave up on you years ago\u201c. He explained that when I was around 14, he realized my bond with my mother was very strong and would never measure up to my relationship with him, and that he \u201cmissed too many moments\u201d so he just \u201cgave up\u201d. Although we are still working on having a better relationship, I don\u2019t think I will ever forgive him for \u201cgiving up\u201d \n\nBecause I never lived with him and only stayed on family visits to his house, I never had my own room in his house and stayed in guest rooms. It hurt, but I can\u2019t imagine what it would feel like if he said \u201coh your not allowed to stay in my home\u201d. She is your daughter, and a minor, and if you care about her in the slightest degree your house should be her house too, no matter how moody, angsty, or teenager-esque your daughter might be acting. \n\nI see so much of my life in your situation, but obviously from your daughters perspective. Your relationship with her now, and these years of her life, will affect the way she is for the rest of her life. Your relationship now will affect the way she sees you, and how she feels like she can act with you. \n\nIf you care about her and genuinely want your relationship to improve, the next time she is in your custody I would plan a special day. Do some thing fun, maybe some thing you could even do small talk through. However I think you need to have a conversation with her and talk about how you feel, how do you feel she is distant with you and you want a better relationship, and ask her why she is acting the way she is and as much of a non-accusatory way as you can. Tell her your side of the story in the divorce, and that you do not want to drive a wedge between her and her mother, but want to undo whatever wedge her mother has put in between your relationship. Make her feel heard, and most importantly, wanted by you.\n\nDo not give up on her, make sure she knows you love her. Telling her not to spend the night at your house would be straight up rejection and she will remember it for the rest of her life.", "YTA. And trying to guilt and gaslight your daughter with passive aggressive manipulations into picking you because you are jealous of her bond with her mother. 14 year girls are moody. Deal with it.
