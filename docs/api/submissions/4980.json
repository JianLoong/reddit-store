{"id": 4980, "submission_id": "zochf3", "title": "AITA for requesting that my wife cleans up after herself?", "selftext": " I (28m) married my wife (23f), who we\u2019ll call \u2018Dani\u2019, about a year ago and we were very lucky to get pregnant soon after. Dani is in her third trimester now and on pregnancy leave. \n\nOnce we got the good news, I started working extra hours in order to save more money for when the baby gets here. This means that I have to get up extra early every morning to get to work (I try to be out the door by 6AM). I get home a little later and I\u2019m usually pretty beat, but I still contribute to the house by doing dishes, cleaning up after the cat (coz she can\u2019t), that kind of stuff. This new routine has been hard on both of us, but we\u2019ve made it work and so far everything has been fine. That is, until the other day, when I wake up to Dani crying. \n\nWe only have one bathroom, which is downstairs, and lately Dani has been having a little more trouble going up and down the stairs. This usually went fine, but this time she didn\u2019t make it. So, when I came downstairs, I found her, in tears, standing in her own mess. She was clearly very embarrassed and even more so that I \u2018caught\u2019 her. I immediately felt bad for her, and tried to comfort her and told her it\u2019s all good, it can happen to anyone, just clean it up and we\u2019ll go back to bed. She asked me if I could help her, but I told her that that made me uncomfortable. I would never expect anyone to clean up after my mess. \n\nTbh it has happened before when I had a couple too many beers, but I always clean up after myself and it would feel weird to ask Dani to do it for me in that situation. She got really mad and called me insensitive for making her clean up after herself after an already embarrassing enough situation.I proposed a compromise - she would clean up the mess, and I would get her clean pj\u2019s (since I\u2019d just done laundry anyway). She asked me if this is what it was going to be like if the baby made a mess, and I told her I would be perfectly okay to clean up after the baby, since it can\u2019t clean up after itself. I then told her I didn\u2019t have time to stand there arguing with her all night when I had to get up in like three hours to go to work and provide for us. So, I walked upstairs, grabbed her pj\u2019s for her and went back to bed. \n\nThe next morning when I got downstairs, I found her on the couch. She told me that she barely slept and felt horrible about the night before. She called me an asshole and said that by not helping her, I only embarrassed her more. She then told me she would be staying with her mom until I got my shit together. It\u2019s been half a day now, and she\u2019s not responding to my texts. I talked about it with a few coworkers and I\u2019m getting mixed responses, but I just want to make sure\u2026 AITA?\n\nEdit 1: So after about 5 hours, most of y'all seem to agree that IATA. Dani's coming home tonight to pick up some stuff, so I hope we'll have a moment to talk it out then. I'll take you guys' verdict into account going into the conversation. I did see some people who would see my side of the story, so I do hope she'll take that into account too. Will update soon!\n\nEdit 2: Keeping it brief bc of word limit, will post full update after judgment. \nLong story short: Dani and her mom came to pick up her things last night. Dani and I talked, she told me her side, I told her my side. In the end, we both ended up apologising and agreed we were gonna work on it. She's gonna be staying with her mom until we find a comfortable way for Dani to sleep downstairs at my place.", "created_utc": 1671301332, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zochf3/aita_for_requesting_that_my_wife_cleans_up_after/", "score": 4851, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dani is in her third trimester now and on pregnancy leave. \n\nOnce we got the good news, I started working extra hours in order to save more money for when the baby gets here. This means that I have to get up extra early every morning to get to work (I try to be out the door by 6AM). I get home a little later and I\u2019m usually pretty beat, but I still contribute to the house by doing dishes, cleaning up after the cat (coz she can\u2019t), that kind of stuff. This new routine has been hard on both of us, but we\u2019ve made it work and so far everything has been fine. That is, until the other day, when I wake up to Dani crying. \n\nWe only have one bathroom, which is downstairs, and lately Dani has been having a little more trouble going up and down the stairs. This usually went fine, but this time she didn\u2019t make it. So, when I came downstairs, I found her, in tears, standing in her own mess. She was clearly very embarrassed and even more so that I \u2018caught\u2019 her. I immediately felt bad for her, and tried to comfort her and told her it\u2019s all good, it can happen to anyone, just clean it up and we\u2019ll go back to bed. She asked me if I could help her, but I told her that that made me uncomfortable. I would never expect anyone to clean up after my mess. \n\nTbh it has happened before when I had a couple too many beers, but I always clean up after myself and it would feel weird to ask Dani to do it for me in that situation. She got really mad and called me insensitive for making her clean up after herself after an already embarrassing enough situation.I proposed a compromise - she would clean up the mess, and I would get her clean pj\u2019s (since I\u2019d just done laundry anyway). She asked me if this is what it was going to be like if the baby made a mess, and I told her I would be perfectly okay to clean up after the baby, since it can\u2019t clean up after itself. I then told her I didn\u2019t have time to stand there arguing with her all night when I had to get up in like three hours to go to work and provide for us. So, I walked upstairs, grabbed her pj\u2019s for her and went back to bed. \n\nThe next morning when I got downstairs, I found her on the couch. She told me that she barely slept and felt horrible about the night before. She called me an asshole and said that by not helping her, I only embarrassed her more. She then told me she would be staying with her mom until I got my shit together. It\u2019s been half a day now, and she\u2019s not responding to my texts. I talked about it with a few coworkers and I\u2019m getting mixed responses, but I just want to make sure\u2026 AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You made your heavily pregnant, hormonal wife feel even more crappy than she already did. She is incubating a small human. She is overly hormonal as it is. Add to that, she's carrying this extra weight, which makes her feel awkward and unwieldy. She has very little control over her body and her emotions. She asked you for just a little bit of extra support, when she was feeling extra low, and, instead of providing it, you made her get down on the floor, and clean up her own mess. I don't blame her for going to stay with her mom. Though, it should've been you forced to sleep on the couch that night.", "YTA. There\u2019s a big difference between soiling yourself because you\u2019re drunk and doing it while pregnant. Are you going to tell the kid to clean up after itself too when there\u2019s an accident?", "YTA.

Not only while I was pregnant but in recovery my partner helped me clean up after the occasional accident which can\u2019t be helped when it happens. \nIt\u2019s so difficult to bend down and clean without being in some form of pain and the fact you made her do that is horrible. You need to grow up and help.\nMy partner has been sick and had accidents and I\u2019ve always helped him it\u2019s called a partnership for a reason", "100% YTA- are you going to criticize and talk shit about your child when they have accidents too?", "YTA. That\u2019s your wife and she\u2019s pregnant with your child. Pregnancy is hard. Part of marriage is being there for your spouse EVEN WHEN IT GETS GROSS. People get sick or incapacitated or overwhelmed and sometimes need help cleaning up after themselves. Someday it might be you. You took vows, honor them. \n\nIf you can\u2019t handle cleaning up someone else\u2019s mess, I have bad news about how babies work.", "YTA. Why would you even think of telling your coworkers?

There is a human on her bladder. That human does not care if she makes it to the bathroom or not or how uncomfortable she may feel. That human also makes it nearly impossible for her to bend over and squatting is also an extreme trial as getting back up is hard. Next time pull up your panties and help your wife", "Dude.. YTA. You feel \"uncomfortable\" cleaning up her mess? \n\nGrowing a brand new human is \"uncomfortable.\" I think you need to educate yourself on what pregnancy actually does to a woman's body. Or just like, not be married and have a baby if you're not willing to do things that are sometimes\"gross\" but necessary..\n\n The baby ends up taking up so much space that there's hardly any room for anything else. It's incredibly frustrating and painful. I'm 8 1/2 months pregnant.. my husband regularly has to help me get up/down.. helps me put pants & underwear on, clips my toe nails,  puts socks on for me, cleaned up my vomit when I couldn't make it to the bathroom, etc. I wake up gasping if I can fall asleep at all, because my lungs don't have enough room to give me full breaths. Baby is getting so big it's been hard to even wipe myself after going to the bathroom. I got a bidet installed to help with cleanliness, but I know damn well that if I needed my husband to wipe my ass, he'd do it. \n\nThank you so much for your post, because I'm realizing now what a godsend my husband is.", "NTA because this was a very effective way to show your wife who she really married, which was clearly valuable to her. Now she knows. Let us know how that goes.", "God I can\u2019t stand partners like you, my boyfriend was so sick one time he quite literally sharted on himself and our bed but guess what I never did? Claim how it made me uncomfortable and I also didn\u2019t refuse to help?? If anything I kept reassuring him that I would rather him go shower and soak and I\u2019ll clean up everything else, bc soiling yourself and being caught is soooo and embarrassing, and you to say cleaning it up would make you uncomfortable is like adding fuel to the god damn fire.", "YTA!!!!", "YTA. Your wife is 7 months pregnant and is literally growing a human being that is pressing on and displacing her internal organs. Help her. Also double YTA for telling your coworkers?! Like???? I couldn\u2019t put on my own shoes by the time I was 5 months pregnant. I can\u2019t imagine if my partner said I was too grown for help putting on my shoes or getting dressed. You owe your wife a MAJOR apology. Grow up.", "You told your CO-WORKERS your wife shit herself? I hope she makes you clean up every diaper your baby craps in. YTA, a completely clueless one.", "YTA. Your heavily pregnant wife is having difficulties carrying your baby, which is also taking a serious toll on your wife's body. Least you could do is just to suck it up and helped her clean up just this once. I hope you're not expecting any more kids because she'll remember this.\n\nDrunk weeing and pregnancy wetting are very different situations. The former is your own stupid fault brought on by yourself, so you should absolutely clean up after yourself. The latter is as a result of 2 consenting adults having a baby, but one of which doesn't want to help the other despite being partly responsible for the condition that she's in.\n\nShe'll not be too thrilled that you shared her embarrassing moment with your coworkers. Sharing anonymously like on here is fine, but in every other situation be it family or friends, it is always on her terms.", "YTA. You are a prime candidate for a vasectomy.", "Would you tell her to clean up after herself if she was having issues after birth? \nA lot of people have to wear diapers after, not even mentioning their wounds that need healing, internal AND external.

Three months prior I was running 16 miles, so it wasn\u2019t like I was out of shape\u2026it\u2019s just awful between ligaments stretching and everything else.\n\nYou are going to be dealing with a lot more bodily fluids once the baby arrives.  Start now.\n\nHopefully your wife has a complication free labor and delivery.  Otherwise she might end up like me and lose part of her intestines in addition to a c-section.  I\u2019m lucky because it could have been fatal.  So next time she asks you for help do it.  \n\nShe\u2019s assuming the pain, discomfort, and risk to make y\u2019all\u2019s baby.  The least you can do is wipe up.", "YTA. This isn\u2019t comparable to creating a self-induced mess because you\u2019ve had too much to drink. She\u2019s sober, growing YOUR baby, and her body has created a situation she has no control over. \n\nI get that you had to get up early to go to work to provide, but could you have a bit more compassion?  She\u2019s already in rough shape and being in her 3rd trimester makes it difficult to manoeuvre even without being sick.", "YTA. She\u2019s heavily pregnant and needed your help. And if you\u2019re uncomfortable with helping her clean up now, you\u2019re really not fit to be of any use to her when she\u2019s in labor and the couple of weeks following. Wait until you see how messy that gets. She\u2019ll likely need help using the bathroom for a while after she gives birth. Even in the hospital, nurses aren\u2019t always immediately available and sometimes a partner has to step in to help\u2014are you going to tell her you\u2019re not comfortable helping her then? She\u2019s carrying your child, which is pretty damn uncomfortable. Suck it up and help her when she asks. And before complaining about how difficult things are for you, remember pregnancy was found to be at the [very top limit](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/06/06/health/pregnant-women-peak-endurance-trnd/index.html) of what a human being can physically endure for an extended period, meaning it\u2019s quite literally the hardest thing a person can physically do without dying, so suck it up and get used to cleaning bodily fluids.", "NTA- unless she was physically unable to clean up after herself I think she\u2019s fine cleaning it herself. I\u2019d also assume the pregnancy hormones probably made her more sensitive to the situation, but I wouldn\u2019t say that to her\u2026. For the same reason. Lol.", "NTA-that is a bit much to ask.  A baby is an entirely different story.  Sounds like you are going to be dealing with 2 babies.", "Assuming she's capable of cleaning herself properly, NTA. I'd feel pretty uncomfortable about cleaning up after my significantly other if they're capable of doing so themself.", "ESH. She is questioning him about being able to clean up the baby...does that not work both ways. She should not expect of him to do what she is not willing to do herself. She is embarrassed, not sick, not physically incapable...both could have cleaned this mess and neither wanted to. Poor baby to come and enter a world of diaper rashes with these two as parents.", "NTA. What you said was perfectly reasonable and my guess is she's overreacting because of pregnancy hormones and emotions. You're going out of your way to work extra hours to take care of the family that the two of you are creating and I think that shows that you're not insensitive to her needs at all. I think she needs to come home to you and work on it like adults.", "NTA.", "Bullshit she could've gotten herself clean after pissing on herself. I'm a mother of 8 kids so I'm not hearing the shit at all. Sorry on this one she's being extra. Just because you're pregnant does not make you completely helpless. Definitely NTA", "Female here NTA. Nobody has ever cleaned body fluids for me and I would never expect them to. I walked to the hospital when I was in labor because I had no choice.

I feel like there is missing info.", "ESH, but mostly her. \n\nOn your part, would it have been that hard of you to get some disinfectant and some paper towels and help your giant pregnant wife clean up an accident? (The question was rhetorical. Of course it wouldn't have been.) It's not like your wife got herself sloppy drunk and made a mess or engaged in other acts of irresponsibility.\n\nNow your wife's reaction was outsized. Maybe it's hormones, maybe she's just a jerk. I don't know. But it sounds like you're a contributing member of the household. She has no business telling you to \"g\\[e\\]t \\[your\\] shit together\" when it sounds like you've done that. Nor does she have any business deploying the silent treatment. I'd ask her if that's the way it's going to be when the baby comes\u2014she runs away and deploys the silent treatment whenever she's unhappy.

Show her love, yes you're running after the material by working insane hours however the baby can't see that but he/she can feel his/her mother's frustration and it's not good. Once or twice a week go visit her with a gift even flowers are okey and ask her how she is doing make her laught, dance with her, just make happy again.

While pregnancy is not a disability in itself for some people the changes to your body during pregnancy is *disabling*. You demonstrated the literal opposite of supporting her and actively loving her *in sickness.* Her body isn't moving well enough to reliably navigate the stairs in a timely manner and you left her to get down on her hands and knees to clean up an accident because you were *uncomfortable.*\n\nI am not surprised that she is at her mom's house.

No, but I did it because I love him and I knew he would have a much harder time doing it. \n\nYTA", "So I think you might benefit by digging a little here. I need you to follow me on this - I don't think you've really thought deeply about what's going on here from your wife's perspective and more importantly, from her physical *experience*, and you really really need to.\n\nYou're thinking about this as she's just too slow to get to the bathroom in time sometimes, and that's not the truth. It's part of the truth - yeah, she's slowed down by this. Why is she slowed down? Because pregnancy. Because the baby. But there's a whole lot more to it.\n\nWhen women get pregnant, to help the physical changes, our bodies produce a chemical called relaxin. It's what it sounds like; it makes things relax, especially tendons and ligaments. This is one reason why women tend to end up with bigger pelvis gaps after birth, and sometimes even bigger feet; the relaxin causes everything to be more easily spread out (and it doesn't always go back to normal afterwards).\n\nThis also adds to difficulty in moving around and slows us down because - well, imagine an athletic figure with an articulated knee, held by a bolt. Normally that action's a little tight, right? Add relaxin and it's awkwardly loose. In other words, while we're figuring out all the other body changes, we also can't rely on our bodies acting the way we want and have come to expect over our entire lives, and if we do it wrong, or if it fails on us, we're risking ourselves and our babies.\n\nNow add in what's going on internally. The baby isn't very big yet, right? Except ... well, except everything else that's in there. There's the baby. There's also the placenta. There's the amniotic sac, filled with fluid. And the inside doesn't suddenly hollow out to make room for those. Instead, all our internal organs get rearranged and pushed around and squashed wherever they'll fit. The baby might be tapdancing on our bladder, but it's got a lot of company. \n\nYou've heard eating for two, by the way? Yeah... we're also peeing for two. Our bodies filter out whatever kind of byproducts the baby's producing. Our systems are kicked into overdrive, filtering out anything harmful to the baby while, like it or not, our own immune systems are dialed WAY down. This is necessary because if our immune systems were acting normally, they'd attack the baby as the invasive organism it technically is. So yeah ... we pee a lot more than we used to, when we're also physically unable to act the way we would, and can't move, and there's physical pressure on our bladders.\n\nAs for mopping it up herself - your wife can't make it to the bathroom on time because of all of this. She's cold, hurt, embarrassed and all too aware of her body not functioning the way she feel it should - and now, oh yay, her husband pretty much says 'yeah, good luck with that, you deal with it'.\n\nYTA. I mean, I get the why of it. But ultimately, you're going to have to make a lot of adjustments to having a new baby in the house. Helping your wife NOW should not be this hard for you to think of.

There is no way she should apologize and you should be extremely eashamed of yourself and should be doing everything in your power to make up for your AH behaviour!  Shame on you!"]}
