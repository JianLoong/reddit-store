{"id": 4980, "submission_id": "zochf3", "title": "AITA for requesting that my wife cleans up after herself?", "selftext": " I (28m) married my wife (23f), who we\u2019ll call \u2018Dani\u2019, about a year ago and we were very lucky to get pregnant soon after. Dani is in her third trimester now and on pregnancy leave. \n\nOnce we got the good news, I started working extra hours in order to save more money for when the baby gets here. This means that I have to get up extra early every morning to get to work (I try to be out the door by 6AM). I get home a little later and I\u2019m usually pretty beat, but I still contribute to the house by doing dishes, cleaning up after the cat (coz she can\u2019t), that kind of stuff. This new routine has been hard on both of us, but we\u2019ve made it work and so far everything has been fine. That is, until the other day, when I wake up to Dani crying. \n\nWe only have one bathroom, which is downstairs, and lately Dani has been having a little more trouble going up and down the stairs. This usually went fine, but this time she didn\u2019t make it. So, when I came downstairs, I found her, in tears, standing in her own mess. She was clearly very embarrassed and even more so that I \u2018caught\u2019 her. I immediately felt bad for her, and tried to comfort her and told her it\u2019s all good, it can happen to anyone, just clean it up and we\u2019ll go back to bed. She asked me if I could help her, but I told her that that made me uncomfortable. I would never expect anyone to clean up after my mess. \n\nTbh it has happened before when I had a couple too many beers, but I always clean up after myself and it would feel weird to ask Dani to do it for me in that situation. She got really mad and called me insensitive for making her clean up after herself after an already embarrassing enough situation.I proposed a compromise - she would clean up the mess, and I would get her clean pj\u2019s (since I\u2019d just done laundry anyway). She asked me if this is what it was going to be like if the baby made a mess, and I told her I would be perfectly okay to clean up after the baby, since it can\u2019t clean up after itself. I then told her I didn\u2019t have time to stand there arguing with her all night when I had to get up in like three hours to go to work and provide for us. So, I walked upstairs, grabbed her pj\u2019s for her and went back to bed. \n\nThe next morning when I got downstairs, I found her on the couch. She told me that she barely slept and felt horrible about the night before. She called me an asshole and said that by not helping her, I only embarrassed her more. She then told me she would be staying with her mom until I got my shit together. It\u2019s been half a day now, and she\u2019s not responding to my texts. I talked about it with a few coworkers and I\u2019m getting mixed responses, but I just want to make sure\u2026 AITA?\n\nEdit 1: So after about 5 hours, most of y'all seem to agree that IATA. Dani's coming home tonight to pick up some stuff, so I hope we'll have a moment to talk it out then. I'll take you guys' verdict into account going into the conversation. I did see some people who would see my side of the story, so I do hope she'll take that into account too.

This new routine has been hard on both of us, but we\u2019ve made it work and so far everything has been fine. That is, until the other day, when I wake up to Dani crying. \n\nWe only have one bathroom, which is downstairs, and lately Dani has been having a little more trouble going up and down the stairs. This usually went fine, but this time she didn\u2019t make it. So, when I came downstairs, I found her, in tears, standing in her own mess. She was clearly very embarrassed and even more so that I \u2018caught\u2019 her. I immediately felt bad for her, and tried to comfort her and told her it\u2019s all good, it can happen to anyone, just clean it up and we\u2019ll go back to bed. She asked me if I could help her, but I told her that that made me uncomfortable. I would never expect anyone to clean up after my mess. \n\nTbh it has happened before when I had a couple too many beers, but I always clean up after myself and it would feel weird to ask Dani to do it for me in that situation. She got really mad and called me insensitive for making her clean up after herself after an already embarrassing enough situation.I proposed a compromise - she would clean up the mess, and I would get her clean pj\u2019s (since I\u2019d just done laundry anyway). She asked me if this is what it was going to be like if the baby made a mess, and I told her I would be perfectly okay to clean up after the baby, since it can\u2019t clean up after itself. I then told her I didn\u2019t have time to stand there arguing with her all night when I had to get up in like three hours to go to work and provide for us. So, I walked upstairs, grabbed her pj\u2019s for her and went back to bed. \n\nThe next morning when I got downstairs, I found her on the couch. She told me that she barely slept and felt horrible about the night before. She called me an asshole and said that by not helping her, I only embarrassed her more. She then told me she would be staying with her mom until I got my shit together. It\u2019s been half a day now, and she\u2019s not responding to my texts. I talked about it with a few coworkers and I\u2019m getting mixed responses, but I just want to make sure\u2026 AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He said that he took a shit at the house before he went to work, and it overflowed when he flushed but he had zero time to clean it up because he had to get to a meeting and could I please clean it for him? I laughed so hard. When I walked in to the bathroom it had overflowed all over the floor but I just took a bunch of towels and cleaned it up and then cleaned it with the cleaner. I didn\u2019t have any problem doing this because sometimes when you love someone you just do stuff that\u2019s gross.", "YTA. Your wife is having trouble going up and down the stairs because she is CARRYING YOUR CHILD. You peeing yourself because you got slobbering drunk is so far removed from what happened to Dani that it isn't in the same universe. \n\nBeing physically unable to make it to the bathroom on time is a disability. While pregnancy is not a disability in itself for some people the changes to your body during pregnancy is *disabling*. You demonstrated the literal opposite of supporting her and actively loving her *in sickness.* Her body isn't moving well enough to reliably navigate the stairs in a timely manner and you left her to get down on her hands and knees to clean up an accident because you were *uncomfortable.*\n\nI am not surprised that she is at her mom's house. Personally, I'd be thinking very hard about continuing the marriage. Being in partnership with another person means that sometimes you have to do uncomfortable stuff when your loved one is having a hard time.

No, but I did it because I love him and I knew he would have a much harder time doing it. \n\nYTA", "So I think you might benefit by digging a little here. I need you to follow me on this - I don't think you've really thought deeply about what's going on here from your wife's perspective and more importantly, from her physical *experience*, and you really really need to.\n\nYou're thinking about this as she's just too slow to get to the bathroom in time sometimes, and that's not the truth. It's part of the truth - yeah, she's slowed down by this. Why is she slowed down? Because pregnancy. Because the baby. But there's a whole lot more to it.\n\nWhen women get pregnant, to help the physical changes, our bodies produce a chemical called relaxin. It's what it sounds like; it makes things relax, especially tendons and ligaments. This is one reason why women tend to end up with bigger pelvis gaps after birth, and sometimes even bigger feet; the relaxin causes everything to be more easily spread out (and it doesn't always go back to normal afterwards).\n\nThis also adds to difficulty in moving around and slows us down because - well, imagine an athletic figure with an articulated knee, held by a bolt. Normally that action's a little tight, right? Add relaxin and it's awkwardly loose. In other words, while we're figuring out all the other body changes, we also can't rely on our bodies acting the way we want and have come to expect over our entire lives, and if we do it wrong, or if it fails on us, we're risking ourselves and our babies.\n\nNow add in what's going on internally. The baby isn't very big yet, right? Except ... well, except everything else that's in there. There's the baby. There's also the placenta. There's the amniotic sac, filled with fluid. And the inside doesn't suddenly hollow out to make room for those. Instead, all our internal organs get rearranged and pushed around and squashed wherever they'll fit. The baby might be tapdancing on our bladder, but it's got a lot of company. \n\nYou've heard eating for two, by the way? Yeah... we're also peeing for two. Our bodies filter out whatever kind of byproducts the baby's producing. Our systems are kicked into overdrive, filtering out anything harmful to the baby while, like it or not, our own immune systems are dialed WAY down. This is necessary because if our immune systems were acting normally, they'd attack the baby as the invasive organism it technically is. So yeah ... we pee a lot more than we used to, when we're also physically unable to act the way we would, and can't move, and there's physical pressure on our bladders.\n\nAs for mopping it up herself - your wife can't make it to the bathroom on time because of all of this. She's cold, hurt, embarrassed and all too aware of her body not functioning the way she feel it should - and now, oh yay, her husband pretty much says 'yeah, good luck with that, you deal with it'.\n\nYTA. I mean, I get the why of it. But ultimately, you're going to have to make a lot of adjustments to having a new baby in the house. Helping your wife NOW should not be this hard for you to think of. I'm sorry, but if you think you're functioning on low sleep now, well ... you're going to have an interesting transition to new fatherhood.
