Dani is in her third trimester now and on pregnancy leave. \n\nOnce we got the good news, I started working extra hours in order to save more money for when the baby gets here. This means that I have to get up extra early every morning to get to work (I try to be out the door by 6AM). I get home a little later and I\u2019m usually pretty beat, but I still contribute to the house by doing dishes, cleaning up after the cat (coz she can\u2019t), that kind of stuff. This new routine has been hard on both of us, but we\u2019ve made it work and so far everything has been fine. That is, until the other day, when I wake up to Dani crying. \n\nWe only have one bathroom, which is downstairs, and lately Dani has been having a little more trouble going up and down the stairs. This usually went fine, but this time she didn\u2019t make it. So, when I came downstairs, I found her, in tears, standing in her own mess. She was clearly very embarrassed and even more so that I \u2018caught\u2019 her. I immediately felt bad for her, and tried to comfort her and told her it\u2019s all good, it can happen to anyone, just clean it up and we\u2019ll go back to bed. She asked me if I could help her, but I told her that that made me uncomfortable. I would never expect anyone to clean up after my mess. \n\nTbh it has happened before when I had a couple too many beers, but I always clean up after myself and it would feel weird to ask Dani to do it for me in that situation. She got really mad and called me insensitive for making her clean up after herself after an already embarrassing enough situation.I proposed a compromise - she would clean up the mess, and I would get her clean pj\u2019s (since I\u2019d just done laundry anyway). She asked me if this is what it was going to be like if the baby made a mess, and I told her I would be perfectly okay to clean up after the baby, since it can\u2019t clean up after itself. I then told her I didn\u2019t have time to stand there arguing with her all night when I had to get up in like three hours to go to work and provide for us. So, I walked upstairs, grabbed her pj\u2019s for her and went back to bed. \n\nThe next morning when I got downstairs, I found her on the couch. She told me that she barely slept and felt horrible about the night before. She called me an asshole and said that by not helping her, I only embarrassed her more. She then told me she would be staying with her mom until I got my shit together. It\u2019s been half a day now, and she\u2019s not responding to my texts. I talked about it with a few coworkers and I\u2019m getting mixed responses, but I just want to make sure\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1671301332, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zochf3/aita_for_requesting_that_my_wife_cleans_up_after/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This new routine has been hard on both of us, but we\u2019ve made it work and so far everything has been fine. That is, until the other day, when I wake up to Dani crying. \n\nWe only have one bathroom, which is downstairs, and lately Dani has been having a little more trouble going up and down the stairs. This usually went fine, but this time she didn\u2019t make it. So, when I came downstairs, I found her, in tears, standing in her own mess. She was clearly very embarrassed and even more so that I \u2018caught\u2019 her. I immediately felt bad for her, and tried to comfort her and told her it\u2019s all good, it can happen to anyone, just clean it up and we\u2019ll go back to bed. She asked me if I could help her, but I told her that that made me uncomfortable. I would never expect anyone to clean up after my mess. \n\nTbh it has happened before when I had a couple too many beers, but I always clean up after myself and it would feel weird to ask Dani to do it for me in that situation. She got really mad and called me insensitive for making her clean up after herself after an already embarrassing enough situation.I proposed a compromise - she would clean up the mess, and I would get her clean pj\u2019s (since I\u2019d just done laundry anyway). She asked me if this is what it was going to be like if the baby made a mess, and I told her I would be perfectly okay to clean up after the baby, since it can\u2019t clean up after itself. I then told her I didn\u2019t have time to stand there arguing with her all night when I had to get up in like three hours to go to work and provide for us. So, I walked upstairs, grabbed her pj\u2019s for her and went back to bed. \n\nThe next morning when I got downstairs, I found her on the couch. She told me that she barely slept and felt horrible about the night before. She called me an asshole and said that by not helping her, I only embarrassed her more. She then told me she would be staying with her mom until I got my shit together. It\u2019s been half a day now, and she\u2019s not responding to my texts. I talked about it with a few coworkers and I\u2019m getting mixed responses, but I just want to make sure\u2026 AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You made your heavily pregnant, hormonal wife feel even more crappy than she already did. She is incubating a small human. She is overly hormonal as it is. Add to that, she's carrying this extra weight, which makes her feel awkward and unwieldy. She has very little control over her body and her emotions. She asked you for just a little bit of extra support, when she was feeling extra low, and, instead of providing it, you made her get down on the floor, and clean up her own mess.

I hope you're not expecting any more kids because she'll remember this.\n\nDrunk weeing and pregnancy wetting are very different situations. The former is your own stupid fault brought on by yourself, so you should absolutely clean up after yourself.
