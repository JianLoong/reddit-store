This year my dad asked what I wanted to do for Christmas, he offered to drive me to my grandparents and pick me up any day, but it's still lonely after my mom's passing, so I asked if we could celebrate it just me and him, nothing big and I promised I won't ever ask again. We also didn't had to make a big dinner and I'll do it with pizza or something, but I wasn't really looking forward to spend the day with anyone else but him. The thing is, my mom and I had a whole ''ritual'' that day, we usually woke up at 8 am, put music (any music!) and cooked, baked and wrapped all day while talking an having fun. My dad dropped my present at 3 pm, every year, and every year my mom gave him a small container full with desserts. \n\nHe asked if we could invite his gf and her son and I, being completely honest, said I'd rather not, but that if he insist and made him happy then okay. He ended up agreeing to be just me and him this year and some family (including his gf) are not happy, since my dad spent the last two years with his gf and her son and people feel like I made him choose, I separated them and I'm not thinking about her kid like at all.

You're also not stopping your dad from celebrating Christmas on a different day with his gf and her son. My dad had to work a lot of Christmases so we'd celebrate around his work schedule like having \"Santa\" cone on Christmas Eve when he had to work the next morning. His gf's kid is 4 so them doing their own celebration on Christmas Eve or something isn't a big deal. Also, his gf's son is still able to celebrate with his mom. Your dad. needs to prioritize you right now. I'm sorry for your loss. Please ignore any family members who have a problem with your request.They can't understand your situation.

His girlfriend needs to see that for how amazing it is.", "Dear OP, I\u2019m very sorry your mom died so young. Good for you to speak honestly to your dad, and I hope you can ignore the people who are just saying negative stuff.  I will suggest that maybe you spend the day after Xmas with your grandparents, because they lost a daughter, just as you,lost your mom. They will probably be very happy to spend some time with you, and if you like they may have some stories about your mom that would be fun to hear.  Take care!", "NTA. You're grieving, and it's your first Christmas  after your mom's passing. Having lost a parent, I understand that holidays and traditions are never going to feel the same again.

Your not asking for anything huge, just a day with just you and your dad. A big Christmas celebration with everyone else can happen on a different day. \n\nWe do Christmas with my grandma the Saturday before. We do Christmas morning with my parents, and Christmas night with my husbands family. On the years I work Christmas, we figure out a different day to do Christmas with my family. \n\nWe are expecting our first baby on the 26th so we aren\u2019t even sure when Christmas celebrations will be this year. \n\nHaving ONE year where it\u2019s just you and your dad is a reasonable request, and your dad is a good dad for respecting that you just want it to be you. Christmas with his girlfriend can be the next day. I\u2019m sure this year will be very emotional for you. You deserve to spend it with someone you love who loves you back, and who isn\u2019t going to put pressure on you to make you feel happy and joyful on a day I\u2019m sure you\u2019d rather just feel your feelings. That\u2019s exactly what is going to happen if his girlfriend and her son are involved. She is going to make you feel bad that you are not playing happy for her son on a day that is special to you and your mom. \n\nAnyone who is days Y T A doesn\u2019t really understand the meaning of the holiday. It doesn\u2019t have to happen ON December 25. It can happen on any day. Heck, my job sometimes I\u2019m not even in the same state as my family. It can happen any day.

I\u2019m sorry for your loss, 8 months is not that long ago, and there is absolutely nothing wrong in needing your father there for a day which was particularly special, as this is your first Christmas without your mother. His girlfriend and her son can handle one holiday without him, your need for support should take priority. \n\nWhen you get to a better place with your grief, hopefully along with support from your dad, you may want to talk with him about how his gf is closed off towards you. There may be a way he can help facilitate a healthier dynamic going forward to make you more comfortable. \n\nLosing a loving parent, particularly a same-sex parent, is incredibly hard to come to terms with. Anything that helps you process any emotions that come up, any needs, or boundaries you have in regards to it is completely ok.

You\u2019re asking for your first Christmas without her. If she guilts you for that then that just shows her character and selfishness", "NTA. You are grieving, and it's wonderful that your dad is stepping up to help you. You may want to sit down with your dad and let him know that the comments gf and other family members are making about you forcing them apart for Christmas are really hurting you to the  point that you are ready to take the emotional hit and say never mind and spend the holiday with your grandparents even though you would rather spend them with him. Make sure he knows that you are not wanting to put a wedge in between him and gf, or him and the other family members, and as much as it would hurt you, you are willing to step back and let them have the holiday. He will probably respond by proverbially ripping everyone a new one, not only as your father but as the adult in your situation. Right now as you are adjusting and grieving is the time to keep all communication with your dad open. Something you might want to consider doing is talking with gf and tell her that this year while you are grieving your mother you aren't up to big celebrations involving you, but perhaps she could help with building traditions for future years. You may have gone all out with your mother in the past, and probably want to keep many of those traditions you and your mother built, but now you need to tailor them to your changed life. Perhaps you don't make as many different desserts or other foods. Perhaps it will be not doing the wrapping on that day. Only you know what you may or may not want to continue. Perhaps something new would be doing something special with dad, gf, and son in preparation in the days just before Christmas. Talk this over with your dad and see what ideas you might come up with. It doesn't need to be implemented this year, but having ideas and potential plans for the future might help with the anger (and bullying) the family is pressing on you.", "NTA there is a reason he asked you and let you choose", "I'm so sorry i couldn't imagine losing my mother at your age, but this is a hard one for sure, i understand where you are coming from, and your dad should be with you on Christmas but at the same time i can understand why your dad was hesitant separating from his gf and her son on Christmas, as far as that kid is concerned your dad is its dad and at that age he will remember not seeing his \"Dad\" on Christmas, is there any chance that there could be some compromise.  \nbut your NTA for wanting to be with your dad for Christmas.", "Nta the girlfriend is being unreasonable", "I mean tough one but ya YTA you can\u2019t commandeer a major holiday like that.

Op is a traumatized child who lost her mother this year and this will be the first Christmas without her, something that was special for the two of them.

When your older, remember to incorporate you and your mother\u2019s traditions and maybe even try to start them with your dad next year.", "NTA", "This right here, like I really feel like the dad needs to handle all of these flying monkeys. They shouldn't even be talking to the kid about this situation", "Yes but also OP: you did not separate them, you did not make him choose. Your dad is an adult, he is taking an active decision of prioritizing his kid. Period. \nYou have absolutely no responsibility on what he does and how he handles his relationship. You did have a responsibility of honoring your feelings and asking for what you need as you grieve your mom.", "Agreed NTA. My heart breaks for OP, because I noticed while asking her dad she  prefaced with being OK with pizza and \"she'll never ask again\".  She's literally asking for the bare minimum and people are calling her an AH.", "I was going to say the same thing. My Mom died 2 weeks before Christmas and a few days before me and my sisters birthdays. My Dad tried really hard to make everything good even though he was hurting so bad. I can\u2019t imagine prioritizing a girlfriend over your child. \n\nNTA", "Right. Not to mention your grieving  kid is asking to spend the holiday solo with you because they miss their mom and in the same breath he asks \"can I invite my Gf?\" How is that solo? I'm so angry for her", "Absolutely, he has to know how important Christmas was for them, to unless he really didn't pay attention. It should have been in his mind. He did ask her what she wants to do, but I just don't know.", "As a Mom I\u2019d be haunting the GF for daring to treat my grieving child this way. 100% NTA and Dad needs to get the rest of the family in line.", "Exactly what I thought.", "It's astonishing.  Dad should protect OP from all this AH's.", "This!!! Especially since OP said Christmas was huge to her mom .", "Completely agree with you here only one small thing he's not the father of the 4 year old he's from a previous relationship so gf should really suck it up she's 15 and lost her mother plus she can't be too surprised especially if op is correct and her dad's gf ignores her", "Thinking about what four year olds comprehend\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it be easy to do Christmas a day early or late with a four year old? Like just keep reminders of what day it is from them might work.", "A tantrum... wow. I sure hope if you have kids they never experience parental loss as a teenager if you're going to be so callous about it.", "And how dense is the dad?! OP is practically begging for solo time with him this holiday and his response is \"can I invite my gf?\" \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Why even put OP in a position to say she doesn't want the GF and kid there when OP already expressed what she needs?  \n\nThe dad being dense sparked the drama. He could have easily said \"OP just lost her mom so I'm going to spend the holiday with just me and her this year\" .....but I have no doubt in my mind he said something like \" OP said she just wants it to be me and her this year \"\n\nHonestly wouldn't surprise me if GF and kid show up anyway", "One year, but slightly more spread out, best friend May, MIL December, best cat ever Christmas eve. It may have been late enough that it was actually Christmas. We ate something with my parents who said\"we know you guys really not in the mood now.\" \n\nIt was nice knowing we didn't have to care. Meant more than some special fuss.", "(Hugs). Last year for me.  Dad and sister within a few weeks.  I tried but holidays last year were a struggle.  Firsts are so hard.  Be good to yourself, please.", "Shit that made me cry. This reminds me so much of my grandma. I used to go to her place to help her every day at 7am and 11pm, so before and after work. I miss my grandma terribly and I still catch myself waking up some days, getting ready to go to her place and only remembering I lost her when I call and there's no one there to pick up. That line that keeps on ringing and then ends when there's no answer always breaks my fucking heart and I can't seem to be able to pick up the pieces. Worst part of it all is that most people don't understand because she was not biologically a parent. To me though she was both mom and dad. She raised me and I owe the person I am to her. I miss her all the time. I just got my degree (computer science) and she was the only one who was in support of it. I kept searching for her in the crowd subconsciously on graduation day. I wish she could have been there. I wish we could spend one more evening playing cards, drinking soda and talking with some of her favourite songs playing in the background. She was my favourite person ever. It's almost been a year now and my heart is still as broken as it was the day I lost her", "I'm so sorry, that hurt so bad reading that picking up the phone line. Brings tears to my eyes too.\n\nMy mom passed 13yrs ago, I was 14. I had a very rocky relationship with her at the time and 100% internalized the grief to take care of my lil bro and grandma, her mom, who took us in.\n\nI didn't grieve, and now I feel those broken parts that I buried so deep not even I can find them. I wish so much that someone had been there for me back then, but it took me over a decade to realize that the person I was wishing for, who took care of me, was the one I was supposed to be grieving all along...\n\nOP is so so so NTA. Please take the time you need to grieve however you need to.", "I am so very sorry for your loss", ">I just got my degree (computer science) and she was the only one who was in support of it. \n\nCongratulations!!! Well done!\n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your grandma - but - I'm sure she would be proud of you!", ">I didn't grieve, and now I feel those broken parts that I buried so deep not even I can find them. \n\nYeah - I know exactly what you mean.\n\nI'm much older than 14 - and more equipped to handle it - and I still have not had the time or mindset to grieve; needing to take care of all the legalities and take over the coordination of taking care of my Mom; it's been a lot - and I'm a (reasonably) mature adult who works in Project Management and can manage some of this stuff like a project.\n\nI can't imagine the impact it would have had on me when I was 14 (well.. I can... from some other things that happened when I was young - but let's not get into that)", "Op is a girl, ffs.", "Where does OP say that gf is criticising her?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She doesn\u2019t seem to have argued or tried to prevent OP being with her dad, just been \u2018not happy\u2019 that she and her son are shut completely out of their normal Christmas celebration.
