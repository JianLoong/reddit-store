I used to always, always, spend Christmas eve and Christmas day with my mom, just because it meant more to her and her family than it did my dad (he and his family aren't really big Christmas lovers, but New Years? that's their deal), they never had a problem. \n\nMy dad begun to date his now gf 3 years ago, she has a 4 yo son from a previous relationship and to be completely fair the three of us aren't really close, I like her son and I like to play with him when we're in the house at the same time, but she and I aren't really friends and sometimes I feel she ignores me. This year my dad asked what I wanted to do for Christmas, he offered to drive me to my grandparents and pick me up any day, but it's still lonely after my mom's passing, so I asked if we could celebrate it just me and him, nothing big and I promised I won't ever ask again. We also didn't had to make a big dinner and I'll do it with pizza or something, but I wasn't really looking forward to spend the day with anyone else but him. The thing is, my mom and I had a whole ''ritual'' that day, we usually woke up at 8 am, put music (any music!) and cooked, baked and wrapped all day while talking an having fun. My dad dropped my present at 3 pm, every year, and every year my mom gave him a small container full with desserts. \n\nHe asked if we could invite his gf and her son and I, being completely honest, said I'd rather not, but that if he insist and made him happy then okay. He ended up agreeing to be just me and him this year and some family (including his gf) are not happy, since my dad spent the last two years with his gf and her son and people feel like I made him choose, I separated them and I'm not thinking about her kid like at all.

Everyone else can have their opinions but the only thing that matters is that you and your dad do something together.", "Absolutely NTA. It's totally understandable that a 15 year old facing her first Christmas without her mom would want to spend special time with her dad. If anyone is an AH here it's the girlfriend, who's exhibiting a serious lack of empathy. She can't spare ONE day for her boyfriend to have alone time with his bereaved daughter???

You're also not stopping your dad from celebrating Christmas on a different day with his gf and her son. My dad had to work a lot of Christmases so we'd celebrate around his work schedule like having \"Santa\" cone on Christmas Eve when he had to work the next morning. His gf's kid is 4 so them doing their own celebration on Christmas Eve or something isn't a big deal. Also, his gf's son is still able to celebrate with his mom. Your dad. needs to prioritize you right now. I'm sorry for your loss. Please ignore any family members who have a problem with your request.They can't understand your situation. Honestly, I think you handled everything in a very mature way expressing what you needed to your dad without insulting his gf.", "I reported the adfun person.

His girlfriend needs to see that for how amazing it is.", "Dear OP, I\u2019m very sorry your mom died so young. Good for you to speak honestly to your dad, and I hope you can ignore the people who are just saying negative stuff.  I will suggest that maybe you spend the day after Xmas with your grandparents, because they lost a daughter, just as you,lost your mom. They will probably be very happy to spend some time with you, and if you like they may have some stories about your mom that would be fun to hear.  Take care!", "NTA. You're grieving, and it's your first Christmas  after your mom's passing. Having lost a parent, I understand that holidays and traditions are never going to feel the same again. It's just one Christmas, one day. Your dad's girlfriend and her son can be with him. Christmas Eve, the day after Christmas, etc. Right now you need him more.", "Pleaseet your dad know about this.", "NTA - the fact you specified this was a one-time request makes it okay in my book\n\nI'm very sorry you lost your mom so young.

Your not asking for anything huge, just a day with just you and your dad. A big Christmas celebration with everyone else can happen on a different day. \n\nWe do Christmas with my grandma the Saturday before. We do Christmas morning with my parents, and Christmas night with my husbands family. On the years I work Christmas, we figure out a different day to do Christmas with my family. \n\nWe are expecting our first baby on the 26th so we aren\u2019t even sure when Christmas celebrations will be this year. \n\nHaving ONE year where it\u2019s just you and your dad is a reasonable request, and your dad is a good dad for respecting that you just want it to be you. Christmas with his girlfriend can be the next day. I\u2019m sure this year will be very emotional for you. You deserve to spend it with someone you love who loves you back, and who isn\u2019t going to put pressure on you to make you feel happy and joyful on a day I\u2019m sure you\u2019d rather just feel your feelings. That\u2019s exactly what is going to happen if his girlfriend and her son are involved. She is going to make you feel bad that you are not playing happy for her son on a day that is special to you and your mom. \n\nAnyone who is days Y T A doesn\u2019t really understand the meaning of the holiday. It doesn\u2019t have to happen ON December 25. It can happen on any day. Heck, my job sometimes I\u2019m not even in the same state as my family. It can happen any day.

However, if you wanted to turn this into an every time situation that would be wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, 8 months is not that long ago, and there is absolutely nothing wrong in needing your father there for a day which was particularly special, as this is your first Christmas without your mother. His girlfriend and her son can handle one holiday without him, your need for support should take priority. \n\nWhen you get to a better place with your grief, hopefully along with support from your dad, you may want to talk with him about how his gf is closed off towards you. There may be a way he can help facilitate a healthier dynamic going forward to make you more comfortable. \n\nLosing a loving parent, particularly a same-sex parent, is incredibly hard to come to terms with. Anything that helps you process any emotions that come up, any needs, or boundaries you have in regards to it is completely ok. You deserve the opportunity to heal, don\u2019t ever feel guilty for that.", "NTA / your mom died. you are 15 ,gf needs to back off", "NTA but everyone else\u2019s opinion doesn\u2019t matter. Also it\u2019s not even his kid. That sounds mean but it\u2019s not about his gf or her kid. It\u2019s about you. You lost your mom. They will have plenty of time with him. You\u2019re asking for your first Christmas without her. If she guilts you for that then that just shows her character and selfishness", "NTA. You are grieving, and it's wonderful that your dad is stepping up to help you. You may want to sit down with your dad and let him know that the comments gf and other family members are making about you forcing them apart for Christmas are really hurting you to the  point that you are ready to take the emotional hit and say never mind and spend the holiday with your grandparents even though you would rather spend them with him. Make sure he knows that you are not wanting to put a wedge in between him and gf, or him and the other family members, and as much as it would hurt you, you are willing to step back and let them have the holiday. He will probably respond by proverbially ripping everyone a new one, not only as your father but as the adult in your situation. Right now as you are adjusting and grieving is the time to keep all communication with your dad open. Something you might want to consider doing is talking with gf and tell her that this year while you are grieving your mother you aren't up to big celebrations involving you, but perhaps she could help with building traditions for future years. You may have gone all out with your mother in the past, and probably want to keep many of those traditions you and your mother built, but now you need to tailor them to your changed life. Perhaps you don't make as many different desserts or other foods. Perhaps it will be not doing the wrapping on that day. Only you know what you may or may not want to continue. Perhaps something new would be doing something special with dad, gf, and son in preparation in the days just before Christmas. Talk this over with your dad and see what ideas you might come up with. It doesn't need to be implemented this year, but having ideas and potential plans for the future might help with the anger (and bullying) the family is pressing on you.", "NTA there is a reason he asked you and let you choose", "I'm so sorry i couldn't imagine losing my mother at your age, but this is a hard one for sure, i understand where you are coming from, and your dad should be with you on Christmas but at the same time i can understand why your dad was hesitant separating from his gf and her son on Christmas, as far as that kid is concerned your dad is its dad and at that age he will remember not seeing his \"Dad\" on Christmas, is there any chance that there could be some compromise.  \nbut your NTA for wanting to be with your dad for Christmas.", "Nta the girlfriend is being unreasonable", "I mean tough one but ya YTA you can\u2019t commandeer a major holiday like that.
