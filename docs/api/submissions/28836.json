I don't like her because shes always eating my food and using my makeup (she even ruined one of my favourite eyeshadow palettes that has been discontinued so I cant even get another one). She doesnt like me because she thinks I'm trying to get with her boyfriend (I'm gay).  \nOur blowup fight was on Friday last week, I was planning on going to a party at a friends house so I was in an admittedly skimpy outfit when I found out my palette was ruined. I was so angry so I confronted her right then. She again accused me of trying to get with her boyfriend because 1) I was making her look bad in front of him and 2) because of my outfit. She accused me of this right in front of him!!! For the millionth time I reminded her that although I dress very femininely I am a LESBIAN.  \nI went to the party, got really drunk, came home, and crashed.  \nThe next morning I woke up and went to the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth and I looked in the mirror and MY EYELASHES WERE CUT SHORT. I was so angry that I immediately went to the living room where she was and started yelling at her, not even noticing that her parents were there at first. Apparently they had stopped by for a visit that day on their way to a wedding. As soon as her mom found out what happened she flew off the handle and started yelling at my roommate too. Get this, when she was in high school her and her little sister got into a fight and she cut off her little sister's eyelashes while she slept!!!! This isnt the first time shes done this!!!  \nThey told her that they were cutting her monthly allowance and that her expenses would be limited to groceries and school related things, no eating out or doing anything fun, until my eyelashes grew back.  \nAs soon as her parents left she started yelling at me for getting her in trouble with them. I just told her that she was crazy and went to my room. I stayed at a friends house that night and the next day I bought and installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door.  \nI talked to my other roommates and while they agree what she did was crazy they think that I could've waited until her parents weren't there and that I \"did it again\" by confronting her in front of her parents right after confronting her in front of her boyfriend. They also say that I can just wear false eyelashes until they grow out again since I wear makeup everyday anyways.  \nI feel like they're completely dismissing the severity of her actions. She snuck into my room at night with a pair of scissors!!! What if I had shifted in my sleep and she had cut my eyelid, or worse, my eye? The thought of her sneaking into my room while I slept with a sharp object makes me shiver.  \nNow I spend most of my time either out of the house and away from her or in my room with the deadbolt locking my door.

At this point, I would call the cops because I\u2019m not dealing with crazy", "Exactly.  File criminal charges against her and get a restraining order barring her from returning to the apartment.", "Yeah she should press charges and get a no-contact order immediately! The roommate can then move out or OP can break lease without penalty.", "Until I read this story, I always thought it was horrific people cut other people's hair while they sleep. Nutjobs cutting my eyelashes while I sleep may be a brand new fear.", "NTA, press charges. Protect yourself from this nutcase.", "File a police report.", "You should go to the police now though.", "Maybe the friends knew what the crazy roommate was planning and agreed with her? \n\nNTA OP but honestly, next time your \"friends\" downplay what she did tell them they're more than welcome to get the same treatment. (btw, they sound like they're not your friends OP)", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

If it's granted she will have to move because she will not be allowed near you.", "Agree! Please REPORT THIS IMMEDIATELY.", "Truly unhinged behavior. Can you even imagine being the roommate? You\u2019re leaning over a sleeping person, you\u2019ve got scissors in hand, the lights are off\u2026 what does that specific moment feel like? Is she thinking \u201cyeah, I\u2019m definitely the good guy here\u201d? Does she grin like she\u2019s doing a good job?\n\nMany questions remain.", "Yup to get that close to her face with scissors means she doesn't give a toss about OPs safety and is at risk of escalating to physically harming OP. OP needs to report this to the police, her uni, the landlord etc and get a restraining order. It is assault and domestic violence. Seriously scary stuff.", "Assault charge and restraining order.  Pretty sure the landlord could evict her over this.", "Time to learn to stand up for yourself.\n\nPolice report for assault, a restraining order, and demanding that she find other accommodations are what an adult needs to do.", "Call the police. File a report. Get a restraining order. Talk to your landlord and explain the situation. Ask if you can be released from your lease earlier.", "Call the campus police, call your landlord, call the real police! You deserve to feel safe and she clearly isn't safe to be around.", "Others have said it, but it's worth reiterating.\n\nYou need to report her to the police.\n\nYou need to report her to your university.", "Be careful, she can tamper with tooth paste, toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner, etc. Anything that goes in or on your body is possibly tainted.", "In my response, I forgot, go to the university and report the assault, don't stop at the police and landlord, do all three and do it quickly.", "Get a fridge for your room and hide your makeup there too.

She\u2019d be kicked out for cause.", "It is not safe for you to be there. At all. She could be poisoning your food. This is 100% a get out situation. Immediately, at any cost.", "You need to contact the uni, the police and your landlord. She broke the terms of her lease by committing multiple criminal acts against you, first criminal damage (makeup) and then actual bodily harm. Your landlord has a legal duty to provide a safe living space. This is not currently a safe living space. This is a really serious situation, You need support with it. You need the unis help to support you with the landlord and also they need to deal with this girl. She is committing a campaign of criminal acts against you.

The university NEEDS to be made aware!

Like girls, you wouldn't fly off the handle IMMEDIATELY if someone cut YOUR EYELASHES? Please. People always tell the victim to act in a way they themselves wouldn't act. NTA", "OP needs to absolutely file a police report about this. Even though she doesn\u2019t have evidence of the act, it needs to be on file. This is seriously psychotic behavior. She is not a child anymore, she\u2019s an adult. This kind of behavior can and will escalate. You need to find a way to move out immediately. The stuff with her parents is irrelevant. Honestly, who cares if Mummy found out? You shouldn\u2019t. But you need to protect yourself from this person.   NTA", "Yeah, the boyfriend should be told about this.", "Exactly!!"]}
