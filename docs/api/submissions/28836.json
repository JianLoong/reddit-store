{"id": 28836, "submission_id": "1772b81", "title": "AITA for confronting my roommate in front of her parents?", "selftext": "Me (F20) and my roommate (F21) have not been getting along very well since moving in together earlier this year but we had our first blow up fight just a couple days ago. I don't like her because shes always eating my food and using my makeup (she even ruined one of my favourite eyeshadow palettes that has been discontinued so I cant even get another one). She doesnt like me because she thinks I'm trying to get with her boyfriend (I'm gay).  \nOur blowup fight was on Friday last week, I was planning on going to a party at a friends house so I was in an admittedly skimpy outfit when I found out my palette was ruined. I was so angry so I confronted her right then. She again accused me of trying to get with her boyfriend because 1) I was making her look bad in front of him and 2) because of my outfit. She accused me of this right in front of him!!! For the millionth time I reminded her that although I dress very femininely I am a LESBIAN.  \nI went to the party, got really drunk, came home, and crashed.  \nThe next morning I woke up and went to the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth and I looked in the mirror and MY EYELASHES WERE CUT SHORT. I was so angry that I immediately went to the living room where she was and started yelling at her, not even noticing that her parents were there at first. Apparently they had stopped by for a visit that day on their way to a wedding. As soon as her mom found out what happened she flew off the handle and started yelling at my roommate too. Get this, when she was in high school her and her little sister got into a fight and she cut off her little sister's eyelashes while she slept!!!! This isnt the first time shes done this!!!  \nThey told her that they were cutting her monthly allowance and that her expenses would be limited to groceries and school related things, no eating out or doing anything fun, until my eyelashes grew back.  \nAs soon as her parents left she started yelling at me for getting her in trouble with them. I just told her that she was crazy and went to my room. I stayed at a friends house that night and the next day I bought and installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door.  \nI talked to my other roommates and while they agree what she did was crazy they think that I could've waited until her parents weren't there and that I \"did it again\" by confronting her in front of her parents right after confronting her in front of her boyfriend. They also say that I can just wear false eyelashes until they grow out again since I wear makeup everyday anyways.  \nI feel like they're completely dismissing the severity of her actions. She snuck into my room at night with a pair of scissors!!! What if I had shifted in my sleep and she had cut my eyelid, or worse, my eye? The thought of her sneaking into my room while I slept with a sharp object makes me shiver.  \nNow I spend most of my time either out of the house and away from her or in my room with the deadbolt locking my door. I don't feel safe in my home even a week later.", "created_utc": 1697213484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1772b81/aita_for_confronting_my_roommate_in_front_of_her/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If anything, she should be thanking her lucky stars that you didn't call the police.\n\nI wouldn't be able to stay there any longer.", "NTA. You could actually press charges for assault for this- and frankly, given her utter  lack of remorse, I would. She will absolutely only get worse. Do you share a bedroom or is it a shared common space with private bedrooms? I\u2019d start locking up absolutely everything you can- I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she retaliates. \n\nI think its fantastic that you called her on this in front of her parents, especially since you didn\u2019t know they were there. They need to know who they\u2019re supporting financially. If you\u2019re at a university and this is campus housing you should also inform the university of her behavior.", "What?\n\nShe physically assaulted you and your friends think you should have waited to confront her and it's no biggie because you can just wear falsies?\n\nGet better friends.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd I think her parents are dope for not blindly siding with their child AND for administering a little bit of consequences for her actions.\n\nYou could have confronted her with the cops at your side. She's getting off light.", "NTA. Holy shit, your roommate is insane! Who goes into someone's room, hovers over them while they sleep.... and cuts their eyelashes. What the ever loving fuck?! I would feel so violated. She assaulted you in your sleep and called her out (rightly so) in front of her parents and she had the gall to be mad at you? What's she going to do next? You could press charges or get a restraining order. That girl needs hardcore therapy and to not live with roommates until she can figure out how to appropriately deal with her emotions.", "Uh... NTA. This person isn't roommate material. I think it's actually good you did it with her parents there. You got important context that her behavior is habitual vs. a one-time thing.", "I truly wish this is fake because who does that??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK let me tell you why your friends are dismissing it. it is because they are 20.\n\nas a former young person, i truly believe in my past self that I would have said something similar. \n\nhowever, as an adult with a developed brain, i know that your roommate is a psychopath. no one ever does that like ever.\n\nAlso as a super normal person when i get angry i cry like every other normal person. NTA  do not live with her.", "NTA you reacted to nice you should be going to the police and press charges against her for assault, that is crazy behavior she should be locked up. also get some new friends", "NTA. I would definitely feel unsafe living with her. If you live in a dorm, talk to the housing folks about moving or having her moved. If you live off campus I\u2019d explain this story to the apartment management and see if you can get a different lease.\n\nYour friends may be trying to see both sides here, but her behavior IS NOT NORMAL. And who knows what comes next with someone like that? I\u2019d never feel safe in my bed again.\n\nThe one positive here is that her parents are using all their leverage to get her to do better. But obviously they failed given she did this to her sister too", "NTA\n\nWho the hell does that?  I can't imagine how she comes up with that, oh let me go cut off her eye lashes?!?!.  Your roommate is completely psycho.  I would move away from her immediately.", "That is assult", "A very clear NTA and she\u2019s lucky you only shouted at her, people get hurt for a lot less.\n\nThe girl is a psycho, I mean..who does that shit? And your other roommates are out of their mind if they don\u2019t think she\u2019ll do something to them one day as well.\n\nI\u2019d either kick her out or move out", "NTA and this is basically assault (also, just psycho behavior). I don't know what your lease is like but please get out/kick her out before it happens again or escalates!", "NTA I would move as soon as you are able", "NTA\n\nIt's unthinkable that anyone would see this as an ok thing to do.\n\nPlease move out to be safe asap", "Strong NTA. Move as soon as you practically can. Can your parents help you with the money that will be required for you to get out before your lease is up? Never, ever fail to lock the deadbolt on your door, even if you are only leaving to grab a drink or go to the bathroom.

NTA You deserve to feel safe in your own home. She needs to find a new place to live or you do, but I think she should have to move out.", "That was assault! You need to make a police report. A roommate who sneaks in another's bedroom at night with scissors isn't funny or trivial. She needs treatment, possibly to be in a facility for mental illness.\nYou're NTA, and the other's are under-reacting to something very serious!", "NTA, move out as soon as you can", "NTA\n\nUm... That is assault. You should have called the freaking police over this. She is lucky that she wasn't arrested.", "NTA. I'd think about a restraining order since this type of 'snip' revenge seems habitual... over what? You didn't want her in your stuff, and she's delusional about your intentions towards her BF?\n\nI'm also afraid for her boyfriend, who she seems overly possessive over and insecure about. If she sees a text from another girl on his phone, is she going to do a Lorena Bobbitt snip on him in the middle of the night?", "Call the police? Pretty sure you are a victim of battery? Nta\n\nEdit. Maybe shave her head. She can wear a wig", "Nta\n\n*You're* completely dismissing what she did. She assaulted you while you slept. Report her to the police, get a restraining order, and make her an ex roommate.", "NTA \n\nCall the police and charge her with assault.", "Nope, there was no reason you needed to wait for anything. She deserved an immediate confrontation -too bad for her that it was witnessed by her parents. NTA\n\nYou need to report this, both to the police and to the college - if only to have a record in case things escalate.", "Damn right. NTA at all. She\u2019s lucky that being scolded by her parents is the only thing she\u2019s dealing with right now.", "And the sad part is I don't even think I personally could have controlled myself from slapping her one. \n\nThat is some next level psycho shit. Nevermind a deadbolt girl get the fuck out. \n\nAbsolutely NTA. She needed a harsh lesson and thankfully her parents were there to give her one.", "Agreed!
