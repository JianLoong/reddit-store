He was 12 at the time. He was my first best friend and as a child, it was was incredibly traumatic seeing him deteriorate and eventually die. I needed years of counselling and I dealt with a lot of depression as a teenager because of it. \n\nA large part of me not being able to really move on (not forget him ever, but just get on with my life) was my mother insisting I get him a card and we go out for a meal to celebrate his birthday every year. I know for some people that might seem like an OK request and a nice thing to do, but it\u2019s incredibly difficult for me and can make my mental health decline.\n\nI like to just remember him privately and light a little candle on his birthday. I\u2019ve told my mum this many times. \n\nYesterday on his 29th, my mum showed up with a birthday cake and candles for him and said I had to join in singing happy birthday. \n\nShe then said for his 30th she\u2019s going to throw a huge party and invite all of our family/friends. I don\u2019t want to go, but I know she\u2019s going to be furious and criticise me to everyone we know since the first time I told her I didn\u2019t want to go out for meals anymore, she said I was being awful and I didn\u2019t care about my brother.

Yesterday was All Saint's Day where I live and it is a day where people also generally go to graveyards to visit the graves of departed loved ones.

She doesn't like visiting her dad's grave.  She prefers to look at photos of him from when he was still with us rather than go to a cemetery and \"be around his corpse\" as she puts it.", "NTA. I recommend therapy for you to learn how to set boundaries with your mother and the gaggle of meddling family friends who are trying to make you feel guilty. \n\nHere\u2019s an essay on guilt that I found on Reddit. It applies to many situations. \n\n_________\n\nFor the feelings of doubt and guilt you are experiencing: \nGuilt can be a helpful feeling when you\u2019ve wronged someone, because it helps you hopefully make better choices in the future and grow to be a better person. However there are times when guilt is what my therapist called \u201cinappropriate guilt\u201d, and that\u2019s when you feel guilty over things you don\u2019t need to, don\u2019t deserve to, or shouldn\u2019t ever feel guilty for. Oftentimes we feel this inappropriate guilt when others get upset over or strongly disagree with our choices/boundaries, especially if they also guilt trip us about it.\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with inappropriate guilt many times in my life before. My therapist recommended me to go through these questions and phrases when I\u2019m wondering if my guilt is \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d guilt:\n\n* Why are you feeling guilty?\n* Did you actually do something wrong or cause real harm to the other person? (And no, them being inconvenienced or upset that they didn\u2019t get their way is NOT harm!)\n* Or did you do something innocuous (not harmful) that the other person just doesn\u2019t want you to do?\n* Does the other person have an ulterior motive for making you feel guilty?\n* Is the other person a reasonable, trustworthy person? Or do they have a history of manipulation, mooching, selfishness, guilt tripping, and/or cruel behavior?\n\nIf you did do wrong then apologize and make things right with the person you wronged/harmed.\n\nHowever if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and they\u2019re guilt tripping you then reminding yourself of these phrases might help:\n\n* You\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions or how they choose to react to your decisions. If your actions aren\u2019t harming anyone, yet someone else chooses to be upset over it anyways, then that\u2019s their choice to make- let them be upset!\n* You are not responsible for other people\u2019s (or their children\u2019s) mental, emotional, financial, or physical well-being. It\u2019s on them to take care of themselves and their dependents, not you.\n* It\u2019s ok to disagree with other people over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok for other people to be upset over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d to something that harms or inconveniences you, or even if you just plain don\u2019t want to do it.\n* Just because someone is upset it doesn\u2019t automatically mean you did anything wrong. Sometimes people get upset just because they\u2019re not getting their way.\n* It\u2019s not your job to fix the situation or their emotions. Their emotions are their responsibility to manage.\n* Being a good person does not equal being a doormat! You can be a kind, generous person and set healthy boundaries, refuse to tolerate disrespect towards you/your loved ones, and not allow others to take advantage of you.\n* You matter too! Prioritizing your mental, emotional, financial, and physical well-being is important.\n* Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. If helping them hurts you, then say no!", "NTA\nBut your mom is. She shouldn\u2019t impose her will on you, over something that makes you genuinely unhappy.", "NTA you should be able to process and grieve in your own way. The fact that this ritual of hers is damaging to you mentally and she refuses to acknowledge this, makes it seem like she doesn't care about you.

I mourn my dad by doing things together that we used to do when he was around, my mum mourns in a totally different way, by staying busy and trying to do the things they always said they would do but never did. \n\nYour mother sounds like she\u2019s been disregarding how you yourself respect his memory your entire life, and there comes a time that you have to put your foot down. It\u2019s going to be messy, but this will carry on until she\u2019s physically incapable of doing it any more, and then the guilt will be laid out for you to continue it after she\u2019s gone. \n\nNTA", "I can't say N A H just because the mom isn't respecting OPs mental health or grieving process at all. She's effectively prioritizing her dead child and her grief over her still living child's mental health and that's... Pretty fucked. NTA.", "She's probably really sad that it won't be a wedding, or a graduation, or grandchildren's birth, and all of those occasions that she would get to celebrate. She might even be jealous than her friends being able to do all of that and her not having an occasion for a big gathering. \n\nI wish she would turn her focus on you instead and celebrate you, your achievements, your birthdays, and your family to come. That would be healthy. This is not.", "I've unfortunately encountered a number of parents who have lost children. Their loss always seemed so deep and they frankly never seemed to fully heal. I always give them wide berth. (Perhaps too much. I'm child free so I maybe I'm erring on the side of caution.)\n\nI agree it sounds like mom is probably dealing with everything suboptimally - - but I can't call her an asshole for doing what she's doing. Almost a \"not an asshole by reason of mental disease or defect\" sort of thing.", "Sorry!", "I am admittedly kind of curious who she\u2019s inviting to this too. A few close family members or maybe really close friends, I understand, but this sounds like it\u2019ll be a big thing. \n\nIf it is, I guarantee that some of the people she\u2019s invited didn\u2019t know him when he was still alive. Unless I was someone who knew him when he was alive or I was a significant other or a close friend or something, I would be VERY uncomfortable if someone invited me to something like this.", "That a really lovely tradition to honor bro.", "Yeah but the way the ratings on this sub go it's basically NTA = OP is right. Y T A = OP is wrong. And N A H = no one's wrong. So while I don't think mom is truly an AH because she is grieving, I can't tell OP that no one's in the wrong here. Mom's definitely in the wrong on this, and if someone tried to tell me how to grieve at the expense of my mental health I'd be pretty upset if someone told me that they weren't wrong for that.", "She has had quite a lot of therapy over the years and she was assigned a psychiatrist for a long time. Unfortunately, presently she won\u2019t hear from anyone that she might need a bit of help. I have suggested it, but she gets very angry and insists she\u2019s fine. I even bought a book on family dynamics/ dealing with trauma that I thought we could read together and she shouted at me and threw me out of her house. It\u2019s really sad, but I\u2019ll keep trying to nudge her to seek help again", "OP - I'm so sorry to hear that. Despite wanting to throw a celebration for your deceased bro, it seems like she's still very actively grieving...and that's affecting her thinking so its her way or grieving or the highway :(  But OP, please protect yourself - you can't help mom if she wan't help herself.", "This is a reference to the  OP's mother's insistence on celebrating her dead son's \"birthday. \"  \n\nDidn't you read it throughout, FFS?", "NTA everyone mourns differently and that should be respected.  Honestly she is acting in a very narcissistic manner, are you sure she isn't doing this for all the sympathy so she can't let anybody forget her terrible loss? You've told her \"many times\" so sometimes the best defense is a good offense.  Before you tell her you won't be going tell her she lost one child and if she doesn't stop retraumatizing you you will go NC and she will have lost two children.", "NTA. Im sorry for your losd. Good luch with you mom and family", "NTA. People grieve differently and sometimes letting go and grieving quietly in private are what is best for someone", "You\u2019re not the AH but your mom needs therapy.

By doing so, she jeopardizes your growth & your relationship with her. \n           Advice from a stranger on an app: don\u2019t be home on his birthdays. Shut off your phone, go to a friend\u2019s home or just don\u2019t answer your door. It sounds like you could have some unexplored resentment towards your brother. He sounds like he was the favorite.", "NTA, you are entitled to to grieve how you want to and your mother insisting that her way is the only right way is very inconsiderate of how this has impacted you", "NTA. Do not risk your mental health for anyone. Your mom can grieve the way she wants, but she cannot force you to grieve the same way. Maybe wrote her a letter explaining how you feel? See if she will join you for a few counseling sessions?", "I could understand if she wanted to throw a fundraiser on his birthday to raise money for pediatric cancer or something. But this same thing every year, with accusations that you don\u2019t care about your brother, does not seem healthy to me. I\u2019ve never lost a child and I can\u2019t imagine her pain. But I\u2019ve known enough siblings who were the ones left after losing a child. If it hasn\u2019t been said, perhaps she needs told she\u2019s alienating her surviving child. You don\u2019t have to be handcuffed to her grief to have loved your brother. The rest of your family should understand that, too.

Throwing a large birthday party for some who has been dead for 18 years is absolutely insane. This should not be normalized as \u201cgrieving\u201d. It\u2019s deeply fucked up, and I\u2019m shocked OP\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t have people in her life trying to get her some help. She\u2019s clearly unwell in some way. NTA obviously", "NTA.  You should be able to mourn in your own way and your mom should realize that what helps her may not help you.  Has your mom gotten counseling along the way?", "I get grief is hard but throwing a 30th birthday PARTY for your child who died at 12 is fucked up. Remembering your kid on the day of their birth? Sure. \n\n\nBut calling it a 30th like he\u2019s actually that old when he died a child is problem uno.\n\nHaving a big party like you\u2019re actually celebrating a 30th party is problemo duo.\n\n\nPutting your grief party ahead of the mental health concerns of your LIVING child is fucked up numero tr\u00e9.\n\nNTA. Skip the party and just silence your phone that day and for the week following until the trolls go back under their bridges. Just bc your mom is into performative grief doesn\u2019t mean you have to go along or that you\u2019re an ah for refusing to take part in this wacko play of hers.", "NAH. I can't imagine the pain your mom has been through. And the pain you have been through. So I just can't bring myself to imply that your mom is the AH in any of this. Because losing at child at 12 years old is so unfathomably awful. \n\nThat said, you are NOT the AH for needing to move on. Your needs are important too. And you do not deserve to be criticized for feeling the way you feel.", "NAH. She\u2019s allowed to throw a party. You\u2019re allowed to decline. Families should find a way to support each other though.", "I'm so sorry for your loss.", "Not to sound too judgmental, but doesn't it feel like she is kind of making it really all about her and her feelings? Like, to host a party every year for somebody who is long gone, it just kind of feels attention seeking in a way. Especially if she's shaming OP for not wanting to be there, it really just seems like she's making it more about her and her feelings. Again, I don't mean to sound too judgmental, but this is just what I'm getting from it.", "She's going to lose another child. It's why I no longer speak with my Mother. She was so busy and lost in the death of my brother she forgot I existed.   \nFamily therapy, individual therapy, interventions. None of it helped. My mother is now NC with her remaining kids, and will never see her grand kids.   \n\n\nNTA OP", "The mother is delusional at this point, this reads like the plot of Next to Normal and how Diana keeps celebrating her son\u2019s birthday even though he\u2019s been dead 18 years.", "I\u2019m so sorry. Cancer is the biggest jerk that ever was.", "Fuck cancer.", "Might I suggest you make your own traditions of honoring your brother by doing some\nVolunteer work that day? By helping others it helps you, plus the added benefit of your mother not being able to criticize you doing a nice thing for others. Might be worth a try. Bottom line though is you need to prioritize your mental health over your mothers tantrums.
