Bringing up someone's disability is exactly the same thing as bringing up their race.", "Ok but what about the initial disability comment which sounds entirely irrelevant? They absolutely shouldn't have used slurs, no excuse for that, but I'm always surprised when ableism is treated as NBD compared to other forms of bigotry.", "If OP ordered more food and/or a lot of customised food, it is possible. I often get modified orders at McD's, so I'll be still waiting for my food even after people who came in after me got their food. Since they have to make modified items - for example, a big mac with extra pickles and no lettuce - from scratch, whereas unmodified items they can just grab from the pre-prepared stuff", "Op was using the table, at least to sit there and wait. It was pretty rude of them to just come in and make themselves at home at the occupied table when there were other options. Complete lack of awareness or consideration for others. I would have been annoyed too. And it\u2019s not like op \u201cwent off\u201d he asked them to just move to an open table. One guy was reasonable and the other one decided to pop off.", "There were 4 wheelchair accessible tables: the one I was at, the one next to me, and two opposite me. It's why I didn't understand what was so hard about scooting his wheelchair a couple inches next to me to the other wheelchair accessible table. But I suppose the drunkenness definitely was a factor, and me responding to his intoxicated self with frustration was not an appropriate response.", "If that were the case I\u2019m sure op would have gotten up and moved for them. That\u2019s just polite and the right thing to do. But these guys just moved on in and took over the table he was sitting at when there were others available. Drunk or not that is just such rude and strange behavior", "Well I had had a bit of a breakdown during that shift, so yes I definitely wasn't in a good place to be around intoxicated men. I regret what I said, but I doubt he does seeing as once I got up he started using other slurs to describe POCs and the LGBTQIA+.", "[deleted]", "How is the word disabled a slur?

You're still an asshole. They're just one too.", "Idk I don't feel like that comment was ableism. He stated that the disability doesn't make him less of an asshole... that's not saying he is an asshole bc of his disability. Apart from that many disabled people are assholes bc they often get coddled and get special treatment, parents saying less no, etc. My mom works with disabled kids and she always says that it is astonishing how little disabled kids get parented bc families feel sorry for them and want to make it up, which then leads to misbehaved adults. So even if he was relating their disability with the entitlement to use the first \"available\" table then it wouldn't have been all too wrong.\n\nBut aside from that rant, I really can't see any ableism with his comment.", "That\u2019s a fair assessment of the situation, and I understand all of the ESH comments and could see why that would also be an acceptable response. I feel as though it was more of a petty/ spiteful thing to say after he was provoked, which is why I went with NTA.", "It would be very rare for a fast food place to have multiple wheelchair accessible tables that can fit 2 people in wheelchairs, I've typically only seen 1 per place, if that. To an able-bodied person it may look like it is at first glance, but things like the exact placement of the rods underneath can make it inaccessible or accessible. Idk without seeing it obviously but just saying that it's *possible* it was the only one that fit both of them.", "There may have been a reason that the other tables would not have worked.  Like angles.  Some tables are harder to get lined up at.  But maybe it was just drunken stubbornness.  The bigotry makes me think they were not good people.  But you bringing up the disability while being at a wheelchair accessible table makes me wonder if you aren't either.", "Was it wheelchair accessible for 2 wheelchairs?", "[deleted]", "That\u2019s rough. I hope your next shift is better!!!", "Reread.\n\nOP says \u201cjust because you\u2019re disabled doesn\u2019t mean you get the table\u201d\n\nRacist man says \u201cOhh you\u2019re playing the disability card!\u201d\n\nAgain, that is not what playing a disability card means.", "It's not a slur but \"you're using your disability as an excuse\" and able-bodied people thinking everything a disabled person does is automatically because of/related to their disability (which it sounds like OP did, the drunk guys' behavior doesn't sound related to their disability - OP decided to jump to that conclusion) are VERY common forms of disability discrimination. No it's not as bad as the N word because nothing is, but it's certainly discriminatory.", "\"you're using your disability as an excuse\" \n\n\"You're using your race as an excuse\"\n\n\"You're using your gender as an excuse\"\n\n\"You're using your sexuality as an excuse\"\n\n\nThey were assholes, but they didn't mention their disability at all. OP just made a bunch of negative assumptions and accused them of something untrue. It's no more acceptable to do with somebody's disability than it is for other things that are  recognised sources of discrimination e.g. gender, race, sexuality etc.\n\n'Disabled', 'gender', 'race', 'sexuality' aren't slurs inherently, but when used against people in this way are clearly all problematic.", "Hard to do when you're dependent on a wheelchair for mobility? I think it was more about being drunk? But no matter. Don't pull nonsense on people, because they don't have to overlook it?", "ORRR it sounds like OP was being ableist which is just as bad as being racist.  Same shit different flavor.", "The guy didn't bring up his disability, so why would OP assume he was using it as an excuse? They're the one who brought it up, not him. It's irrelevant.  \n\nAs for \"many disabled people are assholes because they are coddled and get special treatment,\" lol omg. I'd like anybody who says disabled people get special treatment to spend 1 week navigating inaccessibility and other people's degrading misconceptions. Special treatment my ass.", "Sure it was spiteful but bringing up someone's disability and insinuating it's related to why they're being a dick is no different than bringing up their race, gender, sexual orientation, weight, age, etc. for the same reason.\n\nI don't particularly feel bad for *this* wheelchair user because it sounds like he's a complete asshole on an individual level, but yeah. It's weird how people often dismiss ableism as \"petty\" whereas other forms of bigotry are taken a bit more seriously.", "So if that were the case these guys could have used their words and asked OP to move. But they were rude and then flipped out for no reason", "It\u2019s not hard to do but that doesn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t try. That is what we call an idiot. I just hope it was the alcohol that gave him the audacity and he isn\u2019t like that sober.", "You missed the part where there was a table RIGHT next to them, huh? It\u2019s ok. Reading comp isn\u2019t a gift of all.", "uhh... I wouldn't compare the two. They are entirely different.", "As a disabled person, I want to know what special fucking treatment they're referring to.", "I have noticed this attitude about disability at AITA, as well as the same attitude toward ageism.  It surprises me because with AITA, racism, sexism and bigotry toward the LGBT+ seems well-understood and rejected.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "The first words op writes are \u201cI was sitting at a table.\u201d \n\nI mean idk where you live but I find most people are usually more reasonable and civil about these things. Even the one guy was fine with it, his drunk friend just wanted to fight", "Probably right but if some stinky entitled drunk gets in my face and harasses me, I\u2019m likely to say something I would regret, too. This guy at least admits he does regret his words\u2026pretty sure the other guy doesn\u2019t feel the same.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m not, so I guess I can\u2019t speak from experience of having to ask people to move. However, in this case it wasn\u2019t an issue of op needing to move. These guys were rude, drunk, and aggressive", "Agree to disagree. Harassing someone is a shitty thing to do. OP owns his mistake. He isn\u2019t TA.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Ya I\u2019m sorry, I was just speaking from the viewpoint of a normal human who doesn\u2019t see it as an attack on my rights to just do the right thing and move over to a different table when someone with a wheelchair needs the one I\u2019m specifically sitting at. I\u2019m definitely ignorant to what that\u2019s actually like to live everyday. \n\nAnd agreed, they were drunk and obnoxious and OP went for the low blow which was wrong as well.
