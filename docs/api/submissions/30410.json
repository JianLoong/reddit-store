He stated that the disability doesn't make him less of an asshole... that's not saying he is an asshole bc of his disability. Apart from that many disabled people are assholes bc they often get coddled and get special treatment, parents saying less no, etc. My mom works with disabled kids and she always says that it is astonishing how little disabled kids get parented bc families feel sorry for them and want to make it up, which then leads to misbehaved adults.

Idk without seeing it obviously but just saying that it's *possible* it was the only one that fit both of them.", "There may have been a reason that the other tables would not have worked.  Like angles.  Some tables are harder to get lined up at.  But maybe it was just drunken stubbornness.  The bigotry makes me think they were not good people.

It's no more acceptable to do with somebody's disability than it is for other things that are  recognised sources of discrimination e.g. gender, race, sexuality etc.\n\n'Disabled', 'gender', 'race', 'sexuality' aren't slurs inherently, but when used against people in this way are clearly all problematic, and are actively being used in a derogatory way.", "Hard to do when you're dependent on a wheelchair for mobility?

Same shit different flavor.", "The guy didn't bring up his disability, so why would OP assume he was using it as an excuse? They're the one who brought it up, not him. It's irrelevant.  \n\nAs for \"many disabled people are assholes because they are coddled and get special treatment,\" lol omg. I'd like anybody who says disabled people get special treatment to spend 1 week navigating inaccessibility and other people's degrading misconceptions. Special treatment my ass.", "Sure it was spiteful but bringing up someone's disability and insinuating it's related to why they're being a dick is no different than bringing up their race, gender, sexual orientation, weight, age, etc. for the same reason.\n\nI don't particularly feel bad for *this* wheelchair user because it sounds like he's a complete asshole on an individual level, but yeah.

Also the placement of the buttons.... What the Frick you go right up to the door up the ramp hit the button and the door opens up into your face..... So this special treatment.
