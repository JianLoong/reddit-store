She made it clear that her and her husband want their private space upstairs and they're only comfortable with their niece in the office because she is like their child to them while OP has barely known her step niece and regardless of marriage is still mostly a stranger to her. Hence why shes not comfortable with the step-niece being upstairs and sharing the room.\nI mostly say NTA because OP's niece and her step niece have barely been \"sisters\" for a year and according to OP they dont get along. Furthermore if the parents didnt like this arrangement I feel theyre free to go elsewhere and not look a gift horse in the mouth because at least they have a place to go. \nAlso if its so much an issue the step-niece goes to her fathers on the weekends.

I am in the NTA camp because I think this is a complicated situation and it sounds like you're not crazy about having anyone of them there (other than Jane) and you are doing them a massive favor so that they aren't homeless.

It's true she's already sacrificing a lot for her brother and niece (presumably she doesn't give a flip about the wife and step-niece as she has made it clear they are essentially acquaintances) but putting all four downstairs, allowing the adults upstairs & trusting them to behave like adults, or finding another solution, like air mattresses in the living room, would have been better *for her niece*.\n\nFavouritism is terrible for everyone in a family, and if OP wants the best for her niece- which, presumably, she does- she ought to promote peace between the girls, not take sides, and take advantage of this time to get to know Eve and her mother better as well as spend time with her beloved niece.\n\nETA: u/SignificantNew3200 I'd like to hear your opinion on this.

I wouldn\u2019t put two teenagers in one room if they obviously don\u2019t get along. She did the right choice for her and her husband, the people that own the home and the niece.", "And this OP only further confirms that she\u2019s TA with every comment.", "Because they don\u2019t get along and it\u2019s her aunts home they are staying in. It\u2019s such a cheap shot to make her share space with someone she doesn\u2019t get along with and everyone just acting like they have the same level of relationship. That\u2019s actually so unrealistic.", "Yeah, I\u2019m sure this will do wonders for their relationship.", "I've always found this perplexing. The stepdaughter has her own father.  This can never be fair.    Let's say her family did treat the kids all the same. Is the father of the step niece also going  to by her bio niece a present? I would venture not.  In the same token, it's always going to be unfair to someone.  If all the kids they live with get a present on their birthday. Then the step kids get another present from their bio parent.  Didn't 1 kid just get 2 presents and one kid just got 1 present?    The step niece can choose if she wants to live with her father or even her grandparents. I have no opinion on OP situation, but I always hear the argument that's its unfair to the stepchildren  and I am looking to get a bit more clarity on the situation.", "What are you talking about? Have you never heard of camp? Dorm rooms??", "But \"protecting\" implies that Eve is a threat. There's a big difference between \"don't get along\" and \"one is hurting the other\". \n\nEven if Eve were bullying Jane, OP's decision would be a bad one because it would absolutely enrage Eve and make Jane the target of even more bullying. But we don't have any evidence that Eve is a bully- just that they fight. Eve will be extremely upset & hurt over this, which won't help the fighting. Are you saying you wouldn't be, in her place? She's just a kid.\n\nNo one expects OP to feel the same way about them. We expect her to be *fair* to them in basic, obvious ways. Partly because it prevents hurt & upset like this!", "If you're so quick to treat them this way, how is the rest of the family?? I would imagine they're also horrible to the step daughter. This is fucked up.", "Yes. My mom is 72 and people still believe she's a saint. I'm now forever alienated from family because nobody believed she was hitting my body with anything she can get her hands on (hammer on fingers, belt buckle on my ass, the works). But what's scary is how manipulative she talks.", "Eh. The stepdaughter has a father probably she can live with. She has options besides this.", "How long has Evie and her mom been in your brothers life? And in your lives?", "OP stated in another comment that he has known stepdaughter for about a year", "No I don't treat them badly, but I wouldn't necessarily be comfortable sharing my home with them.", "Absolutely not. As I stated in another comment. If I was staying at a non family members house and they let me out of the goodness of their heart, I would not expect equal treatment to a family member. That\u2019s totally unrealistic.", "Also we don\u2019t give in to bullies to appease them. I\u2019m not saying Eve is a bully. I\u2019m saying OP is the aunt and has loyalty to her niece. Which she would be betraying. That\u2019s her family. Eve is not.", "Why would she give both equal treatment, gifts, and affection? One is her brother\u2019s stepdaughter, who hasn\u2019t been in her family for long, and the other one is her niece, who she has watched grow up and helped raise for 14yrs.\n\nBlended family can\u2019t expect their relatives to immediately treat stepchildren (especially who they just met) the same as the children they watch grow. Her brother decided to step up and be a dad to Eve, that was a decision he made of his own free will, not obligated. He doesn\u2019t get to take away that choice from the rest of his family simply because he chose to step up. Eve is simply his stepdaughter, maybe one day she\u2019d be consider a niece, granddaughter, etc., but that hasn\u2019t happened yet.", "Jesus Christ.  Now I\u2019m sad\u2026. Why do full grown adults do that to their own freaking kids?!", "I would put up with it for family.  Which she is.\n\nOr I would put them all in the same room.\n\nLaying favorites is clearly wrong.", "Boo freaking hoo. It\u2019s been hard on the WHOLE FAMILY. You are honestly the first person I\u2019ve felt the need to stress my verdict in every comment.\nAnd with that, YTA.", "She mentions on another comment that he has been married a year, and dated 4? Before that", "It doesn't matter though. It doesn't matter how she feels about her because she's *behaving* like an asshole. She's letting her feelings push her into bad behaviour & bad choices. The favouritism hurts her *niece* by hurting & upsetting her family & making it *more* difficult to make peace with her stepsister.", "She doesn\u2019t owe eve anything. It\u2019s fair that OP is only comfortable with Bruce in her space. Can eve sleep on the couch then?", "We rarely get to choose our family. \n\nIn fact OP had no say in *either* niece, and just because she loves the blood niece (which is usually quite easy) doesn't mean she couldn't have failed to bond with her niece but wound up liking the stepniece due to common interests or similarities. If that were the case would it be okay for her to have the step-niece in the favoured upstairs room? \n\nI don't know what on earth you're on about with \"performative\" or \"cheap & worthless\". I was talking about being *kind and welcoming* to the stepniece. OP's relationship with Eve doesn't reflect on her relationship with Jane. She isn't picking one over the other. Being *polite* to Eve is not being *hurtful* to Jane.\n\nThe two girls must share a space already: their house. I'm not saying that we have the solution on Reddit- I think the best solution is probably along the lines of all guests sleep downstairs or the guests sort themselves out- but it's times like these that make or break people. OP shouldn't be bringing her worst to the table while her brother's family is having such a bad time. I can't even imagine trying to parent through this."]}
