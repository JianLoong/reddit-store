They dont get to decide what to do with OP's home and shes been more then generous letting them stay there while their situation gets resolved. She made it clear that her and her husband want their private space upstairs and they're only comfortable with their niece in the office because she is like their child to them while OP has barely known her step niece and regardless of marriage is still mostly a stranger to her. Hence why shes not comfortable with the step-niece being upstairs and sharing the room.\nI mostly say NTA because OP's niece and her step niece have barely been \"sisters\" for a year and according to OP they dont get along. Furthermore if the parents didnt like this arrangement I feel theyre free to go elsewhere and not look a gift horse in the mouth because at least they have a place to go. \nAlso if its so much an issue the step-niece goes to her fathers on the weekends. If anything arrangements could be made for her to stay with him if possible in the event that is that big of an issue to share a room or not with her family.", "My only question is did you discuss this with Jane first? I am in the NTA camp because I think this is a complicated situation and it sounds like you're not crazy about having anyone of them there (other than Jane) and you are doing them a massive favor so that they aren't homeless.
