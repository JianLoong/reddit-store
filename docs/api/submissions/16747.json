My husband and I have decided that we are finally in a place to start having babies. Last month I went out to eat with my younger sister and mom to tell them that we are going to start trying. They both were very excited but later my sister took me aside and said she did the math and if I got pregnant like right away I would be due right around her wedding. I told her not to worry because I probably won\u2019t get pregnant right away. She asked if I could maybe wait a month or 2 just in case and I said no because I want a baby before I\u2019m 30 and I shouldn\u2019t have to put my life on hold for her wedding. She dropped it after that. \n\nI found out a couple days ago that I\u2019m pregnant. I really didn\u2019t think I would get pregnant so soon. I did an online due date calculator and according to it my due date is the day before her wedding. I have not went to the doctor yet. \n\nMy husband and I wanted to wait before we told anyone but I knew I had to tell my sister as soon as possible because we are going to go bridesmaids\u2019 dress shopping soon and I\u2019m going to have to adjust my size. I had her over for lunch yesterday to tell her. I knew she would probably be a little upset but when I told her she didn\u2019t say a word. She just got up and left. I was so confused and started crying. She texted me later saying that she knew this was going to happen because I always make everything about me. She said now she has to worry about me not being there and maybe mom because if I go into labor that day mom will want to be at the hospital. She called me selfish and asked why couldn\u2019t I have waited a bit before I started trying. \n\nI told her that just because that\u2019s my estimated due date it doesn\u2019t mean I will go in labor the day before or during her wedding. I haven\u2019t even seen to doctor yet: We can figure out plans closer to the date. She never replied to me.\n\nMy mom called me later and said that my sister told her we had a fight but not what it was about. I didn\u2019t tell her either because this isn\u2019t how I wanted her to find out about her first grandchild. I feel like I can\u2019t even be happy about my pregnancy now. Am I the asshole for not waiting? I just didn\u2019t want to put my life on hold especially if I had trouble conceiving.", "created_utc": 1683574385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13c273m/aita_for_not_waiting_to_get_pregnant/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You agreed to be the MOH, which is a lot of work, but you won't be able to fulfill those duties anymore, will you?  No, of course not.  The baby will be born on or very near to her wedding day, and you'll likely ruin her one day.  Nice job, AH.  Could have been considerate and waited 2 months, but that's not what narcissist older sister does, is it?", "Wanting to have a baby before 30 doesn't really mean much when you're 29 and 30 is right down the road. \n\nAnd you're right you may not go into labor the day before or during the wedding. You may go into labor the week before and there is no way in hell you're gonna be up for being at a wedding let alone as a member of the bridal party. \n\nNow yes you were fully free to start trying for a baby whenever you wanted. Now however that choice has a consequence, probably no longer being part of the wedding party and wedding planning. \n\nSo slight yta", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like this idea of suddenly HAVING to try for a baby exactly nine months before your sister\u2019s wedding is a part of a lifetime of you trying to upstage your sister. You were out of options to upstage her, but having a potential medical emergency during her ceremony is the perfect answer, isn\u2019t it?", "YTA\n\nSeriously, you could have waited one month. You play a big role in your sister's wedding and you decide to start at the worst possible moment. \n\nDon't become MOH or don't try to become pregnant at the worst possible moment for the wedding. Because you did both YTA.", "INFO:  has it always been about you?  Are you the golden child?  Would your mother leave her wedding to be a spectator at your delivery?", "I was between a no assholes & YTA... but settled on YTA for one reason.  You agreed to be the MOH, and don't seem to see why this is a big deal at all.  Do you realize what you signed up for?\n\nThe MOH isn't a ceremonial role;  it's a lot of work to make sure things go smoothly.  And the way the timing works - all you really needed to do was delay things a couple of months.  The alternative is you probably should have just declined being the MOH.\n\nBecause, really... you can't be the MOH anymore - or at least, not without someone else doing the role as well.  MOH is a ton of work & stress;  how the hell are you doing that if you are 9 months pregnant??\n\nSo yeah, I get your sister being pissed off.  If the wedding was 2 years in advance - this would be a VERY different story.  But considering all you had to do was wait a couple more months... I can't fault her reaction.", "Gentle YTA.\n\nIt's true that your life is yours, but a) you agreed to be MOH, b) it's hard to do MOH duties around your due date, c) your sister warned you that it might be bad timing, and d) it would only be a few month wait.  Assuming you had no history of fertility issues, there was no reason you absolutely *had* to start trying right then.  Sure it's not guaranteed you'd get pregnant immediately, but it's not surprising either.\n\n\"Make plans closer to the date\" doesn't really work for the MOH position.", "YTA if you knew you had to be in a wedding in 9 months why not wait a month or 2 to start trying. \n\nYour sister is right no matter what happens at this point you have took the limelight of her wedding off of her.\n\n1- either you will be so big and uncomfortable that everyone will be focusing on making you comfortable.\n\n2- you go into labor the week or two ahead of the wedding and bring a newborn who family will spend more time gushing over it then her.\n\n3- you have put your mom in a horrible position of having to choose between her 2 daughters if you go in labor the day off.\nNo matter what she misses a once in a lifetime event.", "YTA here.  Her comment about you making things about you is telling.  Have you always had a need to steal the attention from her?  Is she smarter, prettier, more popular?  It's one thing to put all the attention on you and the baby but it's Jedi level aholery to make it likely that her own mother won't be at the wedding.  This was absolutely intentional-- be honest and own that.  You've forever altered the fabric of your relationship with you sister.  Not sure why you wanted to do that but congrats you did it.", "INFO: if your mom does have to choose between being at the hospital with you or at your sisters wedding, are you going to encourage your mother to go to the wedding or are you going to ask her to be at the hospital?", "light YTA but here's why. i don't think you should have to put your life on hold for someone else's wedding. *however*.\n\nyou said you and your husband decided you were ready to start trying. that means you planned this. a lot of people plan to start having kids and also consider any future commitments they've already made, in that planning. vacations they've already paid for, job changes if you know in advance, moving house, etc. you had a prior commitment to your sister, but you chose to ignore it simply because you \"didn't think it would happen so fast (and potentially take you and maybe others from her big day).\" but it did.\n\nnow, your sister's wedding day might be completely overshadowed by something no one can control, something everyone is supposed to be really happy about, and it's your fault because you couldn't have just waited an extra couple of months. at least if you had waited and maybe went into premature labor or something, it wouldn't be your fault because you tried to avoid it. but you didn't even do that.", "YTA. Play funny games win funny prizes. \nYou willingly risked not being part of your sisters wedding and voil\u00e0 you got it. You said, you would be maid of honor but clearly can't fulfill the role as promised. Starting with not being able to party and drink, to being exhausted, probably vomiting and overall feeling strange and finally not taking part in the wedding, because either you will just have given birth, birthing on her special day or just feeling too uncomfortable to leave your own house when you are about to pop (sorry for the language, mom of two, I know what I am talking about). You could have waited one or two months and let her have her wedding all to herself, like she asked you to.", "YTA. You could have just waited one or two months.", "Tiny YTA\n\nIn the grand scheme of things having a baby at 29 years and 8 months old isn\u2019t all that different than having a baby at 30 years and 6 months old. \n\nYou have no idea how your body will handle pregnancy. You might be the healthiest and hardiest person ever. Or that baby will sap everything out of you and you\u2019ll be exhausted. Or something in between. \n\nEither way you\u2019re not going to be able to fully participate in the wedding as much as you may think. Your health has to come first and you don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll be feeling when you\u2019re so far along.", "YTA.\n\nYou knowingly risked your sister not having her mom at her wedding just so you could have a kid before 30, which is an arbitrary and asinine goal when you're basically 30 already? *And* you had agreed to be MoH? \n\nYou sound exhausting, and I'd hate to have you for a sister. I hope you tell your mom that she has to stay at the wedding no matter what, since you're the one who made the shitty decision.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou made future commitments and knowingly started with a clear timeline of your sister wedding. Putting your mother in a position where she will be damned choosing either way.\n\nHowever, are you prepared for your mother to choose your sister and supporting her instead? Would you be open to missing the wedding and waiting introducing your bundle of joy to your parents? \n\nIf not this comes off planned and calculated.", "YTA. You could have waited and it sounds like you just want to constantly be the centre of attention. Do your sister a favour (if you love and care about her), step down from the MOH role ASAP. She deserves to be the centre of attention.", "YTA. \"I want a baby before I'm 30.\" But you didn't start planning until you were 29 and your sister was getting married.", "YTA\n\nYou made a commitment to your sister, then you deliberately did something that will eventually break that commitment, even after she asked you to wait just a month, but noooo, you just couldn't keep it in your pants. Now you're gonna ruin your sister's wedding, won't be there to support her like you promised, miss out on most of the pre-wedding events that should have been your job to make happen, possibly take away your mom from the wedding as well, just because you had a personal agenda. This was incredibly selfish.", "I'm gonna go with YTA. You could have started a couple months sooner or waited like 2 months and this wouldn't be an issue. Now there's a good chance you'll miss your sisters wedding. It's not just if you go into labor on her wedding day. If you are early, going to a wedding with a baby that tiny and freshly postpartum will be hard. If you are late, going to a wedding that pregnant could be very miserable. Adjusting by a couple months is not putting your life on hold. I do think it was selfish to start trying right when it would put your due date at her wedding date.", "So you what go have a baby before 30 and you\u2019re 29.. girl you could have keep that lie.. YTA", "Small YTA - it seems from what your sister says that this isn't the first time you've upstaged her. Your sister wanted you to be maid of honour you won't be able to do that a couple of days after giving birth. Putting it off by a couple of months would have had literally no effect what so ever you chose to put your desire to have kids above your sisters desire for you to be maid of honour. Obviously it's more important to you to meet an arbitrary age limit for having kids than it is to be there for your sister on her wedding day. \n\n Try not to be too offended when she drops you from the bridal party since you probably won't be at the wedding due to either being in labour or saddled with one of the many complications of pregnancy.", "YTA....you could have waited to start trying. And she probably is right, you probably do it to her all the time", "Me personally? It would be a no brainer for me to put TTC on hold for 2 months for my sister\u2019s wedding.", "Forget the MOH stuff. YTA because there is now a really good chance the mother of the bride will have to skip the wedding.", "So selfish. I\u2019m sure your sister would give a very different story with a lot of missing details", "INFO:\n\nWhat other events of hers does she think you stile from her or made about you? Her engagement, graduation, when she was ill or injured? \n\nWhat is your history like?\n\nYou're the MOH, you would not be doing all the assisting your role entails. You sound like you have no idea of that reality. Were you hoping to use that against her and blame her for demanding you do MOH when you're pregnant? \n\nIt sounds suspicious.", "INFO: \n\n>She texted me later saying that she knew this was going to happen because I always make everything about me\n\nWhat do you think she meant by this comment? \n\n>if I go into labor that day mom will want to be at the hospital\n\nHow will you handle this situation if it ends up being the case?\n\nRight now I'm thinking N A H. You shouldn't put your reproductive plans on hold for someone else's wedding. That said, it also sounds like you don't really care too much about missing your sister's wedding and/or potentially causing your mom to miss it too.....which kind of sucks a lot for your sister.", "YTA", "YTA- I don't think you're a bad person or anything but, I can completely get why your sister is mad. It seems like you may just be completely ignorant to what being 8-9 months pregnant and/or birth is going to be like. If your still pregnant; you will NOT want to move. If you have the baby before; you aren't going to want to leave the house for at least two weeks after. You could have waited a couple of months to show how important her wedding is to you. After that; she made up a story about why your fighting to your mom.......... as to not ruin something so important to you.", "Slight yta\n\n drop from being moh.  You will be hugely pregnant, if not just-given-birth.\n\nAnd don't act all shocked that sis is upset that her sister AND her mom might not be at her wedding.\n\nYou already waited this long, would 1 or 2 months have really mattered?", "You need to bow out of the MOH position, there\u2019s no possible way you can fulfill that role adequately and there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t even be able to attend the wedding. YTA only for accepting the role knowing there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be pregnant", "You need to get your head around the fact that you cannot plan on being at her wedding, and she cannot plan on you being there.

You started 9 months before the wedding. \n\nYou're not going to be at this wedding and you're not going to be MOH. It's gonna be way to exhausting while making a human being. You're mom is gonna be focused on you since you're growing a human being. Often women want their mother in the delivery room with them. Who knows when you will give birth, can be earlier or later. Everyone is gonna be on alert around your due date. You could have waited 2 weeks and it would have made a difference.", "Your sister is right, you\u2019re definitely an attentive seeker. You could have waited a month and not interrupted your fertility window at all. It would have saved your relationship with your sister. This wasn\u2019t an accident, it was planned. Your sister only asked you to wait a month, not until after her wedding.\n\nNow the next 9 months that should have been focused on her will be on you. You need to drop out of MOH duties immediately before you ruin her wedding.\n\nAnd if your delivery keeps your mom away from the wedding you can bet your sister will go NC on you and probably your mom. It\u2019s too late to save your relationship.\n\nYTA", "OP should never have accepted MoH duties knowing she planned on getting pregnant. She knew there was a risk of giving birth around the time of the wedding. Her sister knew there was a risk as well. OP went and did it anyway.\n\nGive up MoH role, don\u2019t steal focus and let your sister have her day. \n\nIt is really difficult to not believe you have planned this to upstage your sibling and steal focus. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Seems there's more at play since you note that your sister accused you of making everything about yourself.", "I'm going to go with YTA because you could have been kind and waited a few weeks.", "NAH. No one knows how long it\u2019ll take them to get pregnant. I know people who tried for years and other people who didn\u2019t even try\u2026I\u2019m sure we all do. \n\nTry to handle this situation delicately. Due dates are estimates. There is now a chance that you won\u2019t be able to attend your sister\u2019s wedding. It also puts your parents in a tough spot - if you go into labor during the wedding, will they leave? I think the best thing to do here is try to make a list of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and think about solutions to these potential problems. \n\nIf you end up going to the wedding, your husband should absolutely not drink and should be ready to take you to the hospital on a moment\u2019s notice.", "YTA, like one or two months of waiting to start trying isn't a big deal to make sure if you did get pregnant right away it wouldn't be due on the wedding. Some people take years to get tpregant some roght away but waiting a couple of weeks wouldn't have killed you but has ruined your sister's big day... as you have said it is the first grandchild too so of course this will completely overshadow her big day so not only has she lost her MOH but also her wedding hype so she is right you do make it all about you .", "I think YTA because you're acting like you're still gonna be MOH. I'm 26.5 weeks pregnant right now. Second trimester, I'm supposed to be full of energy, and I'm exhausted all of the time.

Normally I\u2019d said N-T-A in this situation but, all she did was ask that you wait two months so you could be at her wedding.

All she asked was that you wait a couple months. That\u2019s nothing in the grand scheme of things. Your sister was not asking you to wait until after her wedding. You\u2019re selfish for agreeing to be her MOH, and then doing this. You\u2019re a terrible sister for potentially making it that your mom won\u2019t be at your sister\u2019s wedding. I hope your sis goes NC with you", "NAH\n\nShe's absolutely right though that you could go into labor right before or at her wedding. What's the plan if that happens? Do you think your mom would be present to celebrate her wedding if that happens?", "YTA. Your sister is right. Instead of being supportive in her milestone, you'll be taking your family's attention and time away from her. Family is supposed to take care of each other. If you didn't care about her wedding, why should she care about your baby. You may be the main character in your story, but you're not in everyone else's.", "YTA you could had waited. Now if you are super pregnant or have the baby around the wedding it will be very complicated. Hope karma everything goes well for both you and your sister m Good luck.", "NAH. Your sister can understandbaly be upset at this. Other than finding a new MOH, she now has the very real possibility of not having very important immediate family not being at her wedding and everyone spending the entire wedding focused on you instead of her. Also, you planned to start right away, so it wasn't an accidental pregnancy, so I can understand her feelings that this feels intentional from her perspective. She is just worried about being overshadowed on an important day for her. \n\nObviously it wasn't intentional, but it has happened now and you can't really brush it off on the idea that is might not happen. Contingency plans are going to need to be made and every possible scenario needs a possible solution. Involve your parents in these plans and hopefully, neither of you will feel lesser than on both those special occasions. \n\nI hope your sister has a wonderful wedding and you are all able to attend. Congrats on your baby as well! I hope you have a wonderful pregnancy and get to feel happy about it.", "NAH but you should step down as MOH", "YTA\n\nWhy did you say it wouldn\u2019t happen?

You want her to just YOLO her way through her wedding? For you? Come on.", "NTA. Not a lot of women get pregnant so quickly at this age.  It\u2019s usually 6-12 months.  So she was right to start trying and not wait another 8-9 months.  Mom doesn\u2019t have to be at the birth.  She can go after the wedding.", "NTA but you\u2019ll likely need to not be the MOH given that you\u2019ll either have a fresh baby or be about to pop on her wedding day.", "NTA. At all. Do not let anyone on this sub tell you that you are. You do not put off having a baby for a wedding. What if you had problems conceiving? What if something happened?

Live your life and chase joy.", "NAH. \nI can\u2019t believe that people here are saying you should have waited longer as the MOH. You would still be heavily pregnant by delaying the 1 month and that would likely cause an issue too. Personally, I would resign from being MOH so the bride has an easier time. \nHowever, she can be upset still. She may be dreading her wedding acting as an informal baby shower and almost every conversation being \u201comg op is pregnant/in labour/\u201c.", "NTA. Conceiving can be hard and take a long time. You don\u2019t need to put this off for someone else. Yes it would be great if you weren\u2019t heavily preggo for the wedding (or miss it due to having just given birth). But no one gets to dictate when you try to conceive. As for the whole \u2018MOH is a huge job you\u2019re being irresponsible\u2019. Well, depends where you\u2019re from - where I live it\u2019s just an honour and a title, sure you can help out a bit more if you want but you\u2019re not obligated to. Plus, pregnant people can do a lot of things, in case others have forgotten. They\u2019re not (usually) incapacitated.", "NTA WTF. I guess lots of ppl just don't get this bc of their family size. \n\nAs one of 9 kids, someone is always announcing or having something go on and it's delightful every time. \n\nYay wedding! Yay babies! \n\nPpl don't OWN a day, and especially not a month or two. Good luck OP. Don't put off having kids for a reason outside your home.", "First of all, congratulations. To be fair, you opened yourself up to the wrath of Reddit but people are being unnecessarily rude and mean on here and not thinking about the person on the other side of the screen. You deserve to celebrate you pregnancy and not feel a tremendous shadow over you!\n\nI have seen so many comments about how you could have waited a month and pregnancy does not always work like that. If you had waited, you could have wound up trying for 6 months. It can be a dice roll and fertility is complicated and (as someone who has been trying for two years) I don\u2019t think it is fair for people to act like you could have waited a month and you would just have gotten pregnant then and all problems solved. \n\nAnd I feel like everyone is ignoring that your sister was a complete B when you told her you were pregnant. Clearly her wedding isn\u2019t for at least 9 months and instead of being happy for you in YOUR moment, she made it about her wedding and even ruined you sharing your pregnancy with your mother. That is crap and you don\u2019t deserve for your pregnancy to be made miserable because your due date falls around your sisters wedding date. \n\nAs to all the comments about how being an MOH is such a big deal- so is being a MOTHER. I won\u2019t lie- the timing ironically sucks. But give your sister the option to allow someone else to play that role and be a bridesmaid if she feels like she needs someone to give more attention to her or she is worried about you missing it. Be clear with your family that her wedding is important and that you and your husband expect everyone to go to her wedding if the timing falls that way. But really NTA, just a crappy set of circumstances. \n\nEnjoy this time! You deserve to, no matter what the trolls of Reddit say.", "Sigh. NTA. Your sister isn't *quite* being a bridezilla, but she obviously has emotions over what is happening.\n\nI hope you can all get to a place where you celebrate two really wonderful things happening in your family at the same time.", "NTA you can bow out of the wedding party maybe \u2026 but lots of pregnant bellies show up at wedding. Congratulations!

I understand your sister being upset that you might miss her wedding but not her claim that you\u2019re trying to make it about you. The two are unrelated. Do you often make big life events about yourself? This sounds like a deeper convo with your sister because it sounds like she is harbouring resentments about something.\n\nHonestly you should step down as MOH because of that possibility. Be a bridesmaid but let someone else be MOH who has no risk of missing the wedding.", "NtA. I was in a similar situation. I agreed to be my sister MOH.

I love how everyone is making MOH duty sound like you're going to Afghanistan.  OMG how can you ever do it if you're pregnant????

My husband and I have decided that we are finally in a place to start having babies. Last month I went out to eat with my younger sister and mom to tell them that we are going to start trying. They both were very excited but later my sister took me aside and said she did the math and if I got pregnant like right away I would be due right around her wedding. I told her not to worry because I probably won\u2019t get pregnant right away. She asked if I could maybe wait a month or 2 just in case and I said no because I want a baby before I\u2019m 30 and I shouldn\u2019t have to put my life on hold for her wedding. She dropped it after that. \n\nI found out a couple days ago that I\u2019m pregnant. I really didn\u2019t think I would get pregnant so soon. I did an online due date calculator and according to it my due date is the day before her wedding. I have not went to the doctor yet. \n\nMy husband and I wanted to wait before we told anyone but I knew I had to tell my sister as soon as possible because we are going to go bridesmaids\u2019 dress shopping soon and I\u2019m going to have to adjust my size. I had her over for lunch yesterday to tell her. I knew she would probably be a little upset but when I told her she didn\u2019t say a word. She just got up and left. I was so confused and started crying. She texted me later saying that she knew this was going to happen because I always make everything about me. She said now she has to worry about me not being there and maybe mom because if I go into labor that day mom will want to be at the hospital. She called me selfish and asked why couldn\u2019t I have waited a bit before I started trying. \n\nI told her that just because that\u2019s my estimated due date it doesn\u2019t mean I will go in labor the day before or during her wedding. I haven\u2019t even seen to doctor yet: We can figure out plans closer to the date. She never replied to me.\n\nMy mom called me later and said that my sister told her we had a fight but not what it was about. I didn\u2019t tell her either because this isn\u2019t how I wanted her to find out about her first grandchild. I feel like I can\u2019t even be happy about my pregnancy now. Am I the asshole for not waiting? I just didn\u2019t want to put my life on hold especially if I had trouble conceiving.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don\u2019t think you should have to put your life on hold, however I think it would\u2019ve been respectful and courteous to wait to start trying. Also, your sister has a point. What if you went into labor during the wedding or during the reception? Is there a plan in place? You\u2019re also the MOH, the size of your dress will change as you grow and the bridal shop is going to be doing quite a bit of alterations to make sure the dress has room for the growing bump. Also, you may not be able to fully participate for whatever reasons due to the pregnancy. However, if you really are doing this just to steal her thunder, you\u2019re an AH. Regardless, I really hope you guys find a way to work things out.", "YTA - technically you're right, you don't have to put your life on hold for your sister. However, it seems like there may be reoccurring issues with you pulling focus. Also - you could have waited a month to avoid the direct overlap. A delay of a month would not have been a major I convenience. It's not like the fertility clinic had called and said this is the appointment or you wait a year.\n\nYou're the maid of honour. There is pretty much no way you will be able to fulfill all those tasks day of when you're hitting your due date.\n\nMy one bridesmaid did have fertility issues. She had to do IVF for both her kids. She was pregnant at my wedding - almost 7 months along. She was careful not to complain during the day but she was miserably uncomfortable in the heat and I kept trying to get her to sit down. But she genuinely wanted to be there for me and because of the situation I knew in asking her this was a possibility.\n\nOne of my friends is getting married this summer. Her you get sister got married last year. They're MOH for each other. Younger sister's due date is pretty much her wedding as well because she just couldn't wait even a month to start trying.

If it was accidental, you figure it out, but this was intentional. That\u2019s what makes you TA. \n\nSeriously\u2026 if I was your sister, I would be livid. Way to steal her thunder. Now the next 9 months, which should have been about her, will be about you instead. Sounds like this kind of self-centered behavior is a trend for you. Maybe you ought to reflect on that some.", "YTA. Yes, it's your life and you can choose to try conceiving whenever you like, but you also chose to accept her offer as MOH. Now, at *best*, you will have to step down from that roll, as it is a lot of time and energy. At *worst*, neither you nor your mother will even be attending the wedding. Would it really have killed you to wait a few months? I feel so bad for your sister.", "Yta", "YTA, I'm so sick of women not understanding how pregnancy works. You absolutely can get pregnant right away. For some people it takes years, yes. She asked you for like a month just so that she could have the people she loved with her for one day. You could become high risk, be put on bed rest, you are NOT promised a smooth road when you get pregnant. She didn't ask you to wait until after the wedding , just give her a few weeks of a buffer. You are 29 years old, you could not have waited one month? I get the feeling that you have been a bit of a golden child and you don't even realize it. Which makes this so much worse.\nsmh", "One cannot really plan to get pregnant at the exact time they want. Most people take a couple of tries/months (some even year or two, and I talking about people who don't have infertility problems). So you are N T A for getting pregnant on the \"first try\". Even if it was your hope to get pregnant. You and your partner decide on your timeline, not anyone else and thus not your sister either. And actually, it's not like you can really plan 100% when someone gets pregnant. You can try, but biology is the one that dictates if it is \"a fusion\" ;-)\n\nI am not American and we do weddings differently where I livet: both partners have a witness and close friends together with that witness do plan a stag/hen party and that's it (and being present at the ceremony as well, of course). But no rehearsal dinner, no matching outfits, heck even a speech isn't a necessity during the festivities (though it is optional if the couple agrees). This is not to diss at the American wedding culture, just pointing out that MOH duties are a big thing in the USA, so if I were you I would step down from the MOH duties. It's going to be a stressful period and your sister does deserve a MOH who can focus on those duties.\n\nNow, first you need to figure out how far along you are, and think things through with your partner and come up with a plan if the due date is exactly or very close to the wedding day. (Another reason for you to step down from being MOH, you might not even be there at the wedding).\n\nI'd say at the moment NAH under the condition that you do step down as MOH.

This way the parents do not have to choose who to support and op again would not be taking attention away from the sister.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t gracefully bow out of the wedding or even gracefully desire not to go then we know op pretty much got pregnant to one up her sister.", "The sister didn't say she had a problem with her being pregnant at the wedding, she just didn't want her due date to be in the same month for fear of her going into labor on the day of the wedding. \n\nHer sister is different than other guests because it could effect the presence of her mother, which would not necessarily cause the same situation if it were her second cousin or her friend. \n\nI am not saying it would have made any difference if she waited a month or not, but now there is a real possibility of it happening on the same day and that suck for everyone involved here.", "Fit in to an altered dress and high heals\n\n\n1- either you will be so big and uncomfortable that everyone will be focusing on making you comfortable.\n\n2- you go into labor the week or two ahead of the wedding and bring a newborn who family will spend more time gushing over it then her.\n\n3- you have put your mom in a horrible position of having to choose between her 2 daughters if you go in labor the day off. No matter what she misses a once in a lifetime event.\n\n\nBut either way I don\u2019t think op will be maid of honor now anyway. If sister doesn\u2019t kick her out she at least volunteer not to be one.", "> Also I'm still waiting to hear what duties a pregnant MOH can't perform.\n\nShe straight up can't be there if she's either in labor or as you suggested went into pre-term labor and has an infant. Or for any of the multiple issues that result in bed rest.  She's unlikely to effectively be present if she's having Braxton-hicks contractions.", "Now she is playing the victim of she can\u2019t be happy. And sister is taking my joy. Never mind op took her sisters joy of  getting to absolutely have moms undivided attention for things. \n\nWhat happens when showers need to be planned? Who gets to have one if family need to travel for one or the other? Instead of focusing all on her sister now mom will have to divide time between op and sister. Which is probably what op wanted.\n\nFact is if she got pregnant now or 6 months it would not have matter. Now just seems like she is competing with the sisters wedding!", "Which is the reason that she wanted to make SURE that SHE had the first grandchild. She\u2019s TA.", "I mean, this would be pretty easy for OP to clear up.\n\nIf she happens to be in the hospital during her sister's wedding and their mom wants to be there as well (delivery room or not), will OP encourage her mom to attend the wedding and be there for her sister or happily accept her mom's presence at the hospital?\n\nI don't think OP should've put her life on hold for the wedding, but she should be aware that this could be very disruptive for her sister's wedding and hopefully plan accordingly. Obviously she can't do much about the actual physical event itself, but she can assure her sister that mom will be at the wedding even if she's giving birth then, and tell mom not to plan on coming to the hospital if it's the same day as the wedding.", "Even bedrest or possible labor is going to disrupt the ceremony.", "That's completely impractical. A wedding functions a lot like a play - if you're in front of the audience you can't also manage the back of the house. The bride and groom are basically on stage all day. They are not available and do not have the bandwidth to manage issues that come up.", "But that\u2019s what you do when you sign up for maid of honor. You help and deal with issues not cause more stress for the bride.", "It's almost like the WHOLE POINT of a MOH is so not everything *has* to fall on the heads if the bride and groom.  Are you OP's alt? Cuz that's the vibes I'm getting from you.", "Exactly\u2026 it\u2019s not just the birth, but she will be baby shopping while the sister is wedding shopping, baby showers during the sister\u2019s bachelorette party, pregnancy photo shoots during the wedding photo shoots, etc. Meanwhile, when OP was getting married, she had the undivided attention of the entire family. OP knows that she is completely taking all of the attention for the entire state of wedding activities from her sister and is dividing the family.", "So she shouldn't get pregnant at all? Because bedrest is not confined the last weeks of pregnancy. Complications could occur at any time. What if she waited until a month or two before and then had a miscarriage close to the wedding? Is she still an asshole then?", "I was thinking the same thing. There are a thousand things they will be competing with each other with.\n\n\nI can\u2019t help this was nothing but away to take attention away from sister", "No one said that. It was that she deliberately waited until nine months to date from her sister\u2019s wedding when she could have had a baby nine months before any wedding was planned or even started the day after the wedding. Do you think that if she was just offered a great job she would have gotten pregnant right away? No, because that is important to her. Yet, her sister\u2019s wedding wasn\u2019t important?\n\nWhy get pregnant at ALL (on purpose) during any part of the last nine months before a major event?"]}
