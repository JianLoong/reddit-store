My husband and I have decided that we are finally in a place to start having babies. Last month I went out to eat with my younger sister and mom to tell them that we are going to start trying. They both were very excited but later my sister took me aside and said she did the math and if I got pregnant like right away I would be due right around her wedding. I told her not to worry because I probably won\u2019t get pregnant right away. She asked if I could maybe wait a month or 2 just in case and I said no because I want a baby before I\u2019m 30 and I shouldn\u2019t have to put my life on hold for her wedding. She dropped it after that. \n\nI found out a couple days ago that I\u2019m pregnant. I really didn\u2019t think I would get pregnant so soon. I did an online due date calculator and according to it my due date is the day before her wedding. I have not went to the doctor yet. \n\nMy husband and I wanted to wait before we told anyone but I knew I had to tell my sister as soon as possible because we are going to go bridesmaids\u2019 dress shopping soon and I\u2019m going to have to adjust my size. I had her over for lunch yesterday to tell her. I knew she would probably be a little upset but when I told her she didn\u2019t say a word. She just got up and left. I was so confused and started crying. She texted me later saying that she knew this was going to happen because I always make everything about me. She said now she has to worry about me not being there and maybe mom because if I go into labor that day mom will want to be at the hospital. She called me selfish and asked why couldn\u2019t I have waited a bit before I started trying. \n\nI told her that just because that\u2019s my estimated due date it doesn\u2019t mean I will go in labor the day before or during her wedding. I haven\u2019t even seen to doctor yet: We can figure out plans closer to the date. She never replied to me.\n\nMy mom called me later and said that my sister told her we had a fight but not what it was about. I didn\u2019t tell her either because this isn\u2019t how I wanted her to find out about her first grandchild. I feel like I can\u2019t even be happy about my pregnancy now. Am I the asshole for not waiting? I just didn\u2019t want to put my life on hold especially if I had trouble conceiving.", "created_utc": 1683574385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13c273m/aita_for_not_waiting_to_get_pregnant/", "score": 440, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You agreed to be the MOH, which is a lot of work, but you won't be able to fulfill those duties anymore, will you?  No, of course not.  The baby will be born on or very near to her wedding day, and you'll likely ruin her one day.  Nice job, AH.  Could have been considerate and waited 2 months, but that's not what narcissist older sister does, is it?", "Wanting to have a baby before 30 doesn't really mean much when you're 29 and 30 is right down the road. \n\nAnd you're right you may not go into labor the day before or during the wedding. You may go into labor the week before and there is no way in hell you're gonna be up for being at a wedding let alone as a member of the bridal party. \n\nNow yes you were fully free to start trying for a baby whenever you wanted. Now however that choice has a consequence, probably no longer being part of the wedding party and wedding planning. \n\nSo slight yta", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like this idea of suddenly HAVING to try for a baby exactly nine months before your sister\u2019s wedding is a part of a lifetime of you trying to upstage your sister. You were out of options to upstage her, but having a potential medical emergency during her ceremony is the perfect answer, isn\u2019t it?", "YTA\n\nSeriously, you could have waited one month. You play a big role in your sister's wedding and you decide to start at the worst possible moment. \n\nDon't become MOH or don't try to become pregnant at the worst possible moment for the wedding. Because you did both YTA.", "INFO:  has it always been about you?  Are you the golden child?  Would your mother leave her wedding to be a spectator at your delivery?", "I was between a no assholes & YTA... but settled on YTA for one reason.  You agreed to be the MOH, and don't seem to see why this is a big deal at all.  Do you realize what you signed up for?\n\nThe MOH isn't a ceremonial role;  it's a lot of work to make sure things go smoothly.  And the way the timing works - all you really needed to do was delay things a couple of months.  The alternative is you probably should have just declined being the MOH.\n\nBecause, really... you can't be the MOH anymore - or at least, not without someone else doing the role as well.  MOH is a ton of work & stress;  how the hell are you doing that if you are 9 months pregnant??\n\nSo yeah, I get your sister being pissed off.  If the wedding was 2 years in advance - this would be a VERY different story.  But considering all you had to do was wait a couple more months... I can't fault her reaction.", "Gentle YTA.\n\nIt's true that your life is yours, but a) you agreed to be MOH, b) it's hard to do MOH duties around your due date, c) your sister warned you that it might be bad timing, and d) it would only be a few month wait.  Assuming you had no history of fertility issues, there was no reason you absolutely *had* to start trying right then.  Sure it's not guaranteed you'd get pregnant immediately, but it's not surprising either.\n\n\"Make plans closer to the date\" doesn't really work for the MOH position.", "YTA if you knew you had to be in a wedding in 9 months why not wait a month or 2 to start trying. \n\nYour sister is right no matter what happens at this point you have took the limelight of her wedding off of her.\n\n1- either you will be so big and uncomfortable that everyone will be focusing on making you comfortable.\n\n2- you go into labor the week or two ahead of the wedding and bring a newborn who family will spend more time gushing over it then her.\n\n3- you have put your mom in a horrible position of having to choose between her 2 daughters if you go in labor the day off.\nNo matter what she misses a once in a lifetime event.", "YTA here.  Her comment about you making things about you is telling.  Have you always had a need to steal the attention from her?  Is she smarter, prettier, more popular?  It's one thing to put all the attention on you and the baby but it's Jedi level aholery to make it likely that her own mother won't be at the wedding.  This was absolutely intentional-- be honest and own that.  You've forever altered the fabric of your relationship with you sister.  Not sure why you wanted to do that but congrats you did it.", "INFO: if your mom does have to choose between being at the hospital with you or at your sisters wedding, are you going to encourage your mother to go to the wedding or are you going to ask her to be at the hospital?", "light YTA but here's why. i don't think you should have to put your life on hold for someone else's wedding. *however*.\n\nyou said you and your husband decided you were ready to start trying. that means you planned this. a lot of people plan to start having kids and also consider any future commitments they've already made, in that planning. vacations they've already paid for, job changes if you know in advance, moving house, etc. you had a prior commitment to your sister, but you chose to ignore it simply because you \"didn't think it would happen so fast (and potentially take you and maybe others from her big day).\" but it did.\n\nnow, your sister's wedding day might be completely overshadowed by something no one can control, something everyone is supposed to be really happy about, and it's your fault because you couldn't have just waited an extra couple of months. at least if you had waited and maybe went into premature labor or something, it wouldn't be your fault because you tried to avoid it. but you didn't even do that.", "YTA. Play funny games win funny prizes. \nYou willingly risked not being part of your sisters wedding and voil\u00e0 you got it. You said, you would be maid of honor but clearly can't fulfill the role as promised. Starting with not being able to party and drink, to being exhausted, probably vomiting and overall feeling strange and finally not taking part in the wedding, because either you will just have given birth, birthing on her special day or just feeling too uncomfortable to leave your own house when you are about to pop (sorry for the language, mom of two, I know what I am talking about). You could have waited one or two months and let her have her wedding all to herself, like she asked you to.", "YTA. You could have just waited one or two months.", "Tiny YTA\n\nIn the grand scheme of things having a baby at 29 years and 8 months old isn\u2019t all that different than having a baby at 30 years and 6 months old. \n\nYou have no idea how your body will handle pregnancy. You might be the healthiest and hardiest person ever. Or that baby will sap everything out of you and you\u2019ll be exhausted. Or something in between. \n\nEither way you\u2019re not going to be able to fully participate in the wedding as much as you may think. Your health has to come first and you don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll be feeling when you\u2019re so far along.", "YTA.\n\nYou knowingly risked your sister not having her mom at her wedding just so you could have a kid before 30, which is an arbitrary and asinine goal when you're basically 30 already? *And* you had agreed to be MoH? \n\nYou sound exhausting, and I'd hate to have you for a sister. I hope you tell your mom that she has to stay at the wedding no matter what, since you're the one who made the shitty decision.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou made future commitments and knowingly started with a clear timeline of your sister wedding. Putting your mother in a position where she will be damned choosing either way.\n\nHowever, are you prepared for your mother to choose your sister and supporting her instead? Would you be open to missing the wedding and waiting introducing your bundle of joy to your parents? \n\nIf not this comes off planned and calculated.", "YTA. You could have waited and it sounds like you just want to constantly be the centre of attention. Do your sister a favour (if you love and care about her), step down from the MOH role ASAP. She deserves to be the centre of attention.", "YTA. \"I want a baby before I'm 30.\" But you didn't start planning until you were 29 and your sister was getting married.", "YTA\n\nYou made a commitment to your sister, then you deliberately did something that will eventually break that commitment, even after she asked you to wait just a month, but noooo, you just couldn't keep it in your pants. Now you're gonna ruin your sister's wedding, won't be there to support her like you promised, miss out on most of the pre-wedding events that should have been your job to make happen, possibly take away your mom from the wedding as well, just because you had a personal agenda. This was incredibly selfish.", "I'm gonna go with YTA. You could have started a couple months sooner or waited like 2 months and this wouldn't be an issue. Now there's a good chance you'll miss your sisters wedding. It's not just if you go into labor on her wedding day. If you are early, going to a wedding with a baby that tiny and freshly postpartum will be hard. If you are late, going to a wedding that pregnant could be very miserable. Adjusting by a couple months is not putting your life on hold. I do think it was selfish to start trying right when it would put your due date at her wedding date.", "So you what go have a baby before 30 and you\u2019re 29.. girl you could have keep that lie.. YTA", "Small YTA - it seems from what your sister says that this isn't the first time you've upstaged her. Your sister wanted you to be maid of honour you won't be able to do that a couple of days after giving birth. Putting it off by a couple of months would have had literally no effect what so ever you chose to put your desire to have kids above your sisters desire for you to be maid of honour. Obviously it's more important to you to meet an arbitrary age limit for having kids than it is to be there for your sister on her wedding day. \n\n Try not to be too offended when she drops you from the bridal party since you probably won't be at the wedding due to either being in labour or saddled with one of the many complications of pregnancy.", "YTA....you could have waited to start trying. And she probably is right, you probably do it to her all the time", "Me personally? It would be a no brainer for me to put TTC on hold for 2 months for my sister\u2019s wedding.", "Forget the MOH stuff. YTA because there is now a really good chance the mother of the bride will have to skip the wedding.", "So selfish. I\u2019m sure your sister would give a very different story with a lot of missing details", "INFO:\n\nWhat other events of hers does she think you stile from her or made about you? Her engagement, graduation, when she was ill or injured? \n\nWhat is your history like?\n\nYou're the MOH, you would not be doing all the assisting your role entails. You sound like you have no idea of that reality. Were you hoping to use that against her and blame her for demanding you do MOH when you're pregnant? \n\nIt sounds suspicious.", "INFO: \n\n>She texted me later saying that she knew this was going to happen because I always make everything about me\n\nWhat do you think she meant by this comment? \n\n>if I go into labor that day mom will want to be at the hospital\n\nHow will you handle this situation if it ends up being the case?\n\nRight now I'm thinking N A H. You shouldn't put your reproductive plans on hold for someone else's wedding. That said, it also sounds like you don't really care too much about missing your sister's wedding and/or potentially causing your mom to miss it too.....which kind of sucks a lot for your sister.", "YTA", "YTA- I don't think you're a bad person or anything but, I can completely get why your sister is mad. It seems like you may just be completely ignorant to what being 8-9 months pregnant and/or birth is going to be like. If your still pregnant; you will NOT want to move. If you have the baby before; you aren't going to want to leave the house for at least two weeks after. You could have waited a couple of months to show how important her wedding is to you. After that; she made up a story about why your fighting to your mom.......... as to not ruin something so important to you.", "Slight yta\n\n drop from being moh.  You will be hugely pregnant, if not just-given-birth.\n\nAnd don't act all shocked that sis is upset that her sister AND her mom might not be at her wedding.\n\nYou already waited this long, would 1 or 2 months have really mattered?", "You need to bow out of the MOH position, there\u2019s no possible way you can fulfill that role adequately and there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t even be able to attend the wedding. YTA only for accepting the role knowing there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be pregnant", "You need to get your head around the fact that you cannot plan on being at her wedding, and she cannot plan on you being there.

You started 9 months before the wedding. \n\nYou're not going to be at this wedding and you're not going to be MOH. It's gonna be way to exhausting while making a human being. You're mom is gonna be focused on you since you're growing a human being. Often women want their mother in the delivery room with them. Who knows when you will give birth, can be earlier or later. Everyone is gonna be on alert around your due date. You could have waited 2 weeks and it would have made a difference.", "Your sister is right, you\u2019re definitely an attentive seeker. You could have waited a month and not interrupted your fertility window at all. It would have saved your relationship with your sister. This wasn\u2019t an accident, it was planned. Your sister only asked you to wait a month, not until after her wedding.\n\nNow the next 9 months that should have been focused on her will be on you. You need to drop out of MOH duties immediately before you ruin her wedding.\n\nAnd if your delivery keeps your mom away from the wedding you can bet your sister will go NC on you and probably your mom. It\u2019s too late to save your relationship.\n\nYTA", "OP should never have accepted MoH duties knowing she planned on getting pregnant. She knew there was a risk of giving birth around the time of the wedding. Her sister knew there was a risk as well. OP went and did it anyway.\n\nGive up MoH role, don\u2019t steal focus and let your sister have her day. \n\nIt is really difficult to not believe you have planned this to upstage your sibling and steal focus. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Seems there's more at play since you note that your sister accused you of making everything about yourself.", "I'm going to go with YTA because you could have been kind and waited a few weeks.", "NAH. No one knows how long it\u2019ll take them to get pregnant. I know people who tried for years and other people who didn\u2019t even try\u2026I\u2019m sure we all do. \n\nTry to handle this situation delicately. Due dates are estimates. There is now a chance that you won\u2019t be able to attend your sister\u2019s wedding. It also puts your parents in a tough spot - if you go into labor during the wedding, will they leave? I think the best thing to do here is try to make a list of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and think about solutions to these potential problems. \n\nIf you end up going to the wedding, your husband should absolutely not drink and should be ready to take you to the hospital on a moment\u2019s notice.", "YTA, like one or two months of waiting to start trying isn't a big deal to make sure if you did get pregnant right away it wouldn't be due on the wedding. Some people take years to get tpregant some roght away but waiting a couple of weeks wouldn't have killed you but has ruined your sister's big day... as you have said it is the first grandchild too so of course this will completely overshadow her big day so not only has she lost her MOH but also her wedding hype so she is right you do make it all about you .", "I think YTA because you're acting like you're still gonna be MOH. I'm 26.5 weeks pregnant right now. Second trimester, I'm supposed to be full of energy, and I'm exhausted all of the time. There is absolutely no way you at 39/40 weeks is going to have the energy to do *anything* MOHs are supposed to do.", "YTA", "YTA. Normally I\u2019d said N-T-A in this situation but, all she did was ask that you wait two months so you could be at her wedding.

All she asked was that you wait a couple months. That\u2019s nothing in the grand scheme of things. Your sister was not asking you to wait until after her wedding. You\u2019re selfish for agreeing to be her MOH, and then doing this. You\u2019re a terrible sister for potentially making it that your mom won\u2019t be at your sister\u2019s wedding. I hope your sis goes NC with you", "NAH\n\nShe's absolutely right though that you could go into labor right before or at her wedding. What's the plan if that happens? Do you think your mom would be present to celebrate her wedding if that happens?", "YTA. Your sister is right. Instead of being supportive in her milestone, you'll be taking your family's attention and time away from her. Family is supposed to take care of each other. If you didn't care about her wedding, why should she care about your baby. You may be the main character in your story, but you're not in everyone else's.", "YTA you could had waited. Now if you are super pregnant or have the baby around the wedding it will be very complicated. Hope karma everything goes well for both you and your sister m Good luck.", "NAH. Your sister can understandbaly be upset at this. Other than finding a new MOH, she now has the very real possibility of not having very important immediate family not being at her wedding and everyone spending the entire wedding focused on you instead of her. Also, you planned to start right away, so it wasn't an accidental pregnancy, so I can understand her feelings that this feels intentional from her perspective. She is just worried about being overshadowed on an important day for her. \n\nObviously it wasn't intentional, but it has happened now and you can't really brush it off on the idea that is might not happen. Contingency plans are going to need to be made and every possible scenario needs a possible solution. Involve your parents in these plans and hopefully, neither of you will feel lesser than on both those special occasions. \n\nI hope your sister has a wonderful wedding and you are all able to attend. Congrats on your baby as well! I hope you have a wonderful pregnancy and get to feel happy about it.", "NAH but you should step down as MOH", "YTA\n\nWhy did you say it wouldn\u2019t happen?

You want her to just YOLO her way through her wedding? For you? Come on.", "NTA. Not a lot of women get pregnant so quickly at this age.  It\u2019s usually 6-12 months.  So she was right to start trying and not wait another 8-9 months.  Mom doesn\u2019t have to be at the birth.  She can go after the wedding.", "NTA but you\u2019ll likely need to not be the MOH given that you\u2019ll either have a fresh baby or be about to pop on her wedding day.", "NTA. At all. Do not let anyone on this sub tell you that you are. You do not put off having a baby for a wedding. What if you had problems conceiving? What if something happened?

Live your life and chase joy.", "NAH. \nI can\u2019t believe that people here are saying you should have waited longer as the MOH. You would still be heavily pregnant by delaying the 1 month and that would likely cause an issue too. Personally, I would resign from being MOH so the bride has an easier time. \nHowever, she can be upset still. She may be dreading her wedding acting as an informal baby shower and almost every conversation being \u201comg op is pregnant/in labour/\u201c.", "NTA. Conceiving can be hard and take a long time. You don\u2019t need to put this off for someone else. Yes it would be great if you weren\u2019t heavily preggo for the wedding (or miss it due to having just given birth). But no one gets to dictate when you try to conceive. As for the whole \u2018MOH is a huge job you\u2019re being irresponsible\u2019. Well, depends where you\u2019re from - where I live it\u2019s just an honour and a title, sure you can help out a bit more if you want but you\u2019re not obligated to. Plus, pregnant people can do a lot of things, in case others have forgotten. They\u2019re not (usually) incapacitated.", "NTA WTF. I guess lots of ppl just don't get this bc of their family size. \n\nAs one of 9 kids, someone is always announcing or having something go on and it's delightful every time. \n\nYay wedding! Yay babies! \n\nPpl don't OWN a day, and especially not a month or two. Good luck OP. Don't put off having kids for a reason outside your home.", "First of all, congratulations. To be fair, you opened yourself up to the wrath of Reddit but people are being unnecessarily rude and mean on here and not thinking about the person on the other side of the screen. You deserve to celebrate you pregnancy and not feel a tremendous shadow over you!\n\nI have seen so many comments about how you could have waited a month and pregnancy does not always work like that. If you had waited, you could have wound up trying for 6 months. It can be a dice roll and fertility is complicated and (as someone who has been trying for two years) I don\u2019t think it is fair for people to act like you could have waited a month and you would just have gotten pregnant then and all problems solved. \n\nAnd I feel like everyone is ignoring that your sister was a complete B when you told her you were pregnant. Clearly her wedding isn\u2019t for at least 9 months and instead of being happy for you in YOUR moment, she made it about her wedding and even ruined you sharing your pregnancy with your mother. That is crap and you don\u2019t deserve for your pregnancy to be made miserable because your due date falls around your sisters wedding date. \n\nAs to all the comments about how being an MOH is such a big deal- so is being a MOTHER. I won\u2019t lie- the timing ironically sucks. But give your sister the option to allow someone else to play that role and be a bridesmaid if she feels like she needs someone to give more attention to her or she is worried about you missing it. Be clear with your family that her wedding is important and that you and your husband expect everyone to go to her wedding if the timing falls that way. But really NTA, just a crappy set of circumstances. \n\nEnjoy this time! You deserve to, no matter what the trolls of Reddit say.", "Sigh. NTA. Your sister isn't *quite* being a bridezilla, but she obviously has emotions over what is happening.\n\nI hope you can all get to a place where you celebrate two really wonderful things happening in your family at the same time.", "NTA you can bow out of the wedding party maybe \u2026 but lots of pregnant bellies show up at wedding. Congratulations!

I understand your sister being upset that you might miss her wedding but not her claim that you\u2019re trying to make it about you. The two are unrelated. Do you often make big life events about yourself? This sounds like a deeper convo with your sister because it sounds like she is harbouring resentments about something.\n\nHonestly you should step down as MOH because of that possibility. Be a bridesmaid but let someone else be MOH who has no risk of missing the wedding.", "NtA. I was in a similar situation. I agreed to be my sister MOH.

It worked out well for us", "NTA.

I love how everyone is making MOH duty sound like you're going to Afghanistan.  OMG how can you ever do it if you're pregnant????

My husband and I have decided that we are finally in a place to start having babies. Last month I went out to eat with my younger sister and mom to tell them that we are going to start trying. They both were very excited but later my sister took me aside and said she did the math and if I got pregnant like right away I would be due right around her wedding. I told her not to worry because I probably won\u2019t get pregnant right away. She asked if I could maybe wait a month or 2 just in case and I said no because I want a baby before I\u2019m 30 and I shouldn\u2019t have to put my life on hold for her wedding. She dropped it after that. \n\nI found out a couple days ago that I\u2019m pregnant. I really didn\u2019t think I would get pregnant so soon. I did an online due date calculator and according to it my due date is the day before her wedding. I have not went to the doctor yet. \n\nMy husband and I wanted to wait before we told anyone but I knew I had to tell my sister as soon as possible because we are going to go bridesmaids\u2019 dress shopping soon and I\u2019m going to have to adjust my size. I had her over for lunch yesterday to tell her. I knew she would probably be a little upset but when I told her she didn\u2019t say a word. She just got up and left. I was so confused and started crying. She texted me later saying that she knew this was going to happen because I always make everything about me. She said now she has to worry about me not being there and maybe mom because if I go into labor that day mom will want to be at the hospital. She called me selfish and asked why couldn\u2019t I have waited a bit before I started trying. \n\nI told her that just because that\u2019s my estimated due date it doesn\u2019t mean I will go in labor the day before or during her wedding. I haven\u2019t even seen to doctor yet: We can figure out plans closer to the date. She never replied to me.\n\nMy mom called me later and said that my sister told her we had a fight but not what it was about. I didn\u2019t tell her either because this isn\u2019t how I wanted her to find out about her first grandchild. I feel like I can\u2019t even be happy about my pregnancy now. Am I the asshole for not waiting? I just didn\u2019t want to put my life on hold especially if I had trouble conceiving.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don\u2019t think you should have to put your life on hold, however I think it would\u2019ve been respectful and courteous to wait to start trying. Also, your sister has a point. What if you went into labor during the wedding or during the reception? Is there a plan in place? You\u2019re also the MOH, the size of your dress will change as you grow and the bridal shop is going to be doing quite a bit of alterations to make sure the dress has room for the growing bump. Also, you may not be able to fully participate for whatever reasons due to the pregnancy. However, if you really are doing this just to steal her thunder, you\u2019re an AH. Regardless, I really hope you guys find a way to work things out.", "YTA - technically you're right, you don't have to put your life on hold for your sister. However, it seems like there may be reoccurring issues with you pulling focus. Also - you could have waited a month to avoid the direct overlap. A delay of a month would not have been a major I convenience. It's not like the fertility clinic had called and said this is the appointment or you wait a year.\n\nYou're the maid of honour. There is pretty much no way you will be able to fulfill all those tasks day of when you're hitting your due date.\n\nMy one bridesmaid did have fertility issues. She had to do IVF for both her kids. She was pregnant at my wedding - almost 7 months along. She was careful not to complain during the day but she was miserably uncomfortable in the heat and I kept trying to get her to sit down. But she genuinely wanted to be there for me and because of the situation I knew in asking her this was a possibility.\n\nOne of my friends is getting married this summer. Her you get sister got married last year. They're MOH for each other. Younger sister's due date is pretty much her wedding as well because she just couldn't wait even a month to start trying.

If it was accidental, you figure it out, but this was intentional. That\u2019s what makes you TA. \n\nSeriously\u2026 if I was your sister, I would be livid. Way to steal her thunder. Now the next 9 months, which should have been about her, will be about you instead. Sounds like this kind of self-centered behavior is a trend for you. Maybe you ought to reflect on that some.", "YTA. Yes, it's your life and you can choose to try conceiving whenever you like, but you also chose to accept her offer as MOH. Now, at *best*, you will have to step down from that roll, as it is a lot of time and energy. At *worst*, neither you nor your mother will even be attending the wedding. Would it really have killed you to wait a few months? I feel so bad for your sister.", "Yta", "YTA, I'm so sick of women not understanding how pregnancy works. You absolutely can get pregnant right away. For some people it takes years, yes. She asked you for like a month just so that she could have the people she loved with her for one day. You could become high risk, be put on bed rest, you are NOT promised a smooth road when you get pregnant. She didn't ask you to wait until after the wedding , just give her a few weeks of a buffer. You are 29 years old, you could not have waited one month? I get the feeling that you have been a bit of a golden child and you don't even realize it. Which makes this so much worse.\nsmh", "One cannot really plan to get pregnant at the exact time they want. Most people take a couple of tries/months (some even year or two, and I talking about people who don't have infertility problems). So you are N T A for getting pregnant on the \"first try\". Even if it was your hope to get pregnant. You and your partner decide on your timeline, not anyone else and thus not your sister either. And actually, it's not like you can really plan 100% when someone gets pregnant. You can try, but biology is the one that dictates if it is \"a fusion\" ;-)\n\nI am not American and we do weddings differently where I livet: both partners have a witness and close friends together with that witness do plan a stag/hen party and that's it (and being present at the ceremony as well, of course). But no rehearsal dinner, no matching outfits, heck even a speech isn't a necessity during the festivities (though it is optional if the couple agrees). This is not to diss at the American wedding culture, just pointing out that MOH duties are a big thing in the USA, so if I were you I would step down from the MOH duties. It's going to be a stressful period and your sister does deserve a MOH who can focus on those duties.\n\nNow, first you need to figure out how far along you are, and think things through with your partner and come up with a plan if the due date is exactly or very close to the wedding day. (Another reason for you to step down from being MOH, you might not even be there at the wedding).\n\nI'd say at the moment NAH under the condition that you do step down as MOH.

This way the parents do not have to choose who to support and op again would not be taking attention away from the sister.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t gracefully bow out of the wedding or even gracefully desire not to go then we know op pretty much got pregnant to one up her sister.", "The sister didn't say she had a problem with her being pregnant at the wedding, she just didn't want her due date to be in the same month for fear of her going into labor on the day of the wedding. \n\nHer sister is different than other guests because it could effect the presence of her mother, which would not necessarily cause the same situation if it were her second cousin or her friend. \n\nI am not saying it would have made any difference if she waited a month or not, but now there is a real possibility of it happening on the same day and that suck for everyone involved here.", "Fit in to an altered dress and high heals\n\n\n1- either you will be so big and uncomfortable that everyone will be focusing on making you comfortable.\n\n2- you go into labor the week or two ahead of the wedding and bring a newborn who family will spend more time gushing over it then her.\n\n3- you have put your mom in a horrible position of having to choose between her 2 daughters if you go in labor the day off. No matter what she misses a once in a lifetime event.\n\n\nBut either way I don\u2019t think op will be maid of honor now anyway. If sister doesn\u2019t kick her out she at least volunteer not to be one.", "> Also I'm still waiting to hear what duties a pregnant MOH can't perform.\n\nShe straight up can't be there if she's either in labor or as you suggested went into pre-term labor and has an infant. Or for any of the multiple issues that result in bed rest.  She's unlikely to effectively be present if she's having Braxton-hicks contractions.", "Now she is playing the victim of she can\u2019t be happy. And sister is taking my joy. Never mind op took her sisters joy of  getting to absolutely have moms undivided attention for things. \n\nWhat happens when showers need to be planned? Who gets to have one if family need to travel for one or the other? Instead of focusing all on her sister now mom will have to divide time between op and sister. Which is probably what op wanted.\n\nFact is if she got pregnant now or 6 months it would not have matter. Now just seems like she is competing with the sisters wedding!", "Which is the reason that she wanted to make SURE that SHE had the first grandchild. She\u2019s TA.", "I mean, this would be pretty easy for OP to clear up.\n\nIf she happens to be in the hospital during her sister's wedding and their mom wants to be there as well (delivery room or not), will OP encourage her mom to attend the wedding and be there for her sister or happily accept her mom's presence at the hospital?\n\nI don't think OP should've put her life on hold for the wedding, but she should be aware that this could be very disruptive for her sister's wedding and hopefully plan accordingly. Obviously she can't do much about the actual physical event itself, but she can assure her sister that mom will be at the wedding even if she's giving birth then, and tell mom not to plan on coming to the hospital if it's the same day as the wedding.", "Even bedrest or possible labor is going to disrupt the ceremony.", "That's completely impractical. A wedding functions a lot like a play - if you're in front of the audience you can't also manage the back of the house. The bride and groom are basically on stage all day. They are not available and do not have the bandwidth to manage issues that come up.", "But that\u2019s what you do when you sign up for maid of honor. You help and deal with issues not cause more stress for the bride.", "It's almost like the WHOLE POINT of a MOH is so not everything *has* to fall on the heads if the bride and groom.  Are you OP's alt? Cuz that's the vibes I'm getting from you.", "Exactly\u2026 it\u2019s not just the birth, but she will be baby shopping while the sister is wedding shopping, baby showers during the sister\u2019s bachelorette party, pregnancy photo shoots during the wedding photo shoots, etc. Meanwhile, when OP was getting married, she had the undivided attention of the entire family. OP knows that she is completely taking all of the attention for the entire state of wedding activities from her sister and is dividing the family.", "So she shouldn't get pregnant at all? Because bedrest is not confined the last weeks of pregnancy. Complications could occur at any time. What if she waited until a month or two before and then had a miscarriage close to the wedding? Is she still an asshole then?", "I was thinking the same thing. There are a thousand things they will be competing with each other with.\n\n\nI can\u2019t help this was nothing but away to take attention away from sister", "No one said that. It was that she deliberately waited until nine months to date from her sister\u2019s wedding when she could have had a baby nine months before any wedding was planned or even started the day after the wedding. Do you think that if she was just offered a great job she would have gotten pregnant right away? No, because that is important to her. Yet, her sister\u2019s wedding wasn\u2019t important?\n\nWhy get pregnant at ALL (on purpose) during any part of the last nine months before a major event?", "YTA, what\u2019s two months of waiting when you\u2019re already almost 30? It\u2019s a small thing to do for someone. Is everything always about you? I\u2019m getting a feeling that it is.", "Ahhh YTA. Waiting 1 or 2 months is perfectly reasonable. If she had asked you to wait until after her wedding, now that would be a different story.  I think you need to apologize to your sister, back down from MOH, and make sure she knows that you won\u2019t be stealing your mom away to the hospital.  You\u2019d have to be a special kind of cruel to take your mom from your sisters wedding. If having your mom at the hospital was important enough to you then you could\u2019ve waited a month to start trying.", "YTA.  You intentionally made the decision that assumed the risk that you would both let your sister down as a MOH and steal the focus of her wedding/your mom.  \n\nIt was your decision to make but making the decision you did does make you a crappy sister.  \n\nAnd I note that even in the face of you demonstrating how little you cared about her wedding, your sister still didn\u2019t steal your baby news thunder by telling your mom about your pregnancy.  Think about that.", "YTA, you haven\u2019t even gone to the doctor yet, and you\u2019re already causing drama. Waiting even one month would have been best, at least so your due date is not close enough that you could literally be in labour during her ceremony. I wouldn\u2019t blame her for changing her date just so people will be present and not checking their phones for updates every ten minutes.", "Just say what's important to your sister isn't important to you and move on", "YTA - how are you gonna be a MOH while you\u2019re either about ready to give birth or have just given birth? And like she pointed out, what if that takes your mom away from the wedding too? PLUS the MOH isn\u2019t a bridesmaid but a huge role in the wedding. Kinda wild she wants you there that badly and you\u2019re brushing it off like it\u2019s not an issue.", "YTA. She asked you to wait a month or 2. She wasn\u2019t asking for a year. Now I understand the desire to start trying immediately when you decide you want a baby, and how each month can feel like an eternity. But seriously - it\u2019s suspicious that you decided 9 months before the wedding.", "YTA. You could have waited a few months. Especially if the only reasoning for starting to try for a baby is a made up goal based on your age and has no medical reasoning behind it. And if you had medical reasoning I doubt you'd have waited until you were exactly 29 to try and get pregnant before 30.", "You didnt care about her wedding and her feelings. Fine, you do you since as you say it\u2019s not fair to you. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t care about your pregnancy and your feelings, that\u2019s fair too. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair of you to now be all upset about this, when THIS EXACT ISSUE could have been avoided. You knew she asked, you didn\u2019t care, did it anyways, and then now expect little sis to be happy? \n\nThat\u2019s not rational and is cruel. \n\nYTA for sure. You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too.", "You really couldn't have waited a little bit longer to raw dog it? YTA.\n\nYou sound like a \"I'm the main character\" kinda person and seems like your little sister is finally fed up.", "If you do give birth day of, will you tell mom to go be with sister? Or will you demand mom to be with you. \n\nYTA- I wavered back and forth but sisters comment sealed the deal for me. You made it about you. That was purposeful. No one tries hoping it doesn\u2019t happen. You knew exactly what you were doing.", "You may end up missing her wedding entirely. All because you couldn't wait a couple months.\nYTA. Im so glad my sister and I would never dream about doing that to each other.", "YTA. \u201cI told her not to worry because I probably won\u2019t get pregnant right away.\u201d You realized it was reasonable for her to be worried, yet accepted being her MOH anyways. This wasn\u2019t an accidental pregnancy. It would have been no inconvenience to start trying 2-3 months later. Your sole reason for not doing so is because you arbitrarily/superficially want a baby at 29 and not 30. You also put your sister in the unenviable position of having to ask someone to be her second choice MOH.", "Yta, seems like you stealing the spotlight isn\u2019t a new thing and you knew when the wedding is going to be. Of course you\u2019re free to do as you choose with your life choices but there\u2019s still going to be consequences. You will either be very nearly going to give birth, be giving birth or have just given birth and have a newborn at the wedding. So you\u2019re unlikely to even make your sisters wedding. I hope your parents aren\u2019t going to be forced to choose between being with you at the hospital and your sisters wedding, if they do then I hope they choose her wedding. When she throws a bachelorette party then are you scheduling a baby shower for the same time too?", "I initially thought it was N A H because I thought your sister asked you to wait and then you discovered you were pregnant very shortly after...then I read it again and saw that the meeting was a month before you learned about your pregnancy. So, yeah. YTA.\n\nI won't bore everybody with the stats here, but contrary to the beliefs of many rather gross people, AFAB people don't actually dry up into ovum-less husks on their 30th birthdays. If you're under 37 and have no known issues that would get in the way, you stand a very good chance of conceiving within a year, and not even particularly terrible odds of it happening in the first month (about one in five). \n\nIf you were already 35 and could see the fertility cliff from where you're standing, I might have a little more sympathy, but as it stands, a month or two wouldn't have had any impact on your chances. The kind thing to do would be to wait.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019ve had this scenario transpire with a couple of friends.\n\nYou were aware of your sisters wedding date and you absolutely could have waited one month or two. You chose instead to commit to being maid of honour and being at the wedding only to start trying to get pregnant at a time that would immediately coincide with her wedding. Not only will you not attend, but it\u2019s likely your families will be preoccupied and not attend as well.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing you can do now, but this will likely irreparably harm your relationship with your sister.", "YTA, you couldn't have waited three months? Would it really have made such a huge difference to your baby timeline?", "YTA. In addition to what everyone else says, you will take the focus off the wedding. Will you have a joint baby/bridal shower with your sister? If you don't have the baby before the wedding, will everyone be watching and catering to you expecting you to go into labor at any moment? Your sister has every right to be upset with you. Go ahead and step down as MOH now so she has time to find a replacement.", "Nevermind the MOH role, you knowingly made it very likely that you won\u2019t be in any condition to be at your own sister\u2019s wedding, and made it possible that your mom won\u2019t either. The fact you couldn\u2019t just wait a month makes it crystal clear you aren\u2019t one to compromise (selfish). It\u2019s pretty sus that you just out of nowhere announced that you will now start trying for a baby knowing completely well that it would interfere, and then after announcing it immediately got pregnant. Seems the entire thing, including the impact it would have on your sister, was premeditated.", "YTA!  Normally I don\u2019t think people should have to wait to get pregnant because of a wedding but you completely disregarded your sister by getting pregnant with a due date the day before her wedding.  All she asked of you was that you wait a couple of months to start trying; you\u2019re young and I assume you have no reason to assume you would have trouble conceiving. But it\u2019s over now, so you need to remove yourself from the wedding and have a very serious talk with your mom about making sure the wedding takes priority even if your baby is born.  Your sister gets one wedding day and I think she probably has a very good reason to accuse you of making everything about you.", "YTA. She was only asking you to wait one or two months, not years. You did make her wedding about you. She\u2019s not wrong.", "YTA and better not ask her to plan the baby shower!", "Let's look at this from the other perspective. I have a wedding coming up thats been planned for monthes. My sister agrees to be maid of honor for the wedding which can be alot of work, and then she decides to start trying for a baby and get pregnant at the moment where the birth will land right on the same time frame as my wedding. Plus this is a reoccurring problem where she wants all the attention.\n\nYTA.", "Wow, you are a *massive* AH. \n\n\u201cI want a baby before I\u2019m 30\u201d\n\nYou are *29* years old. You make it sound like your biological clock has run out. You are still at your *most fertile* until your mid 30\u2019s.  It could have waited 2 months and you already had obligations that you are now throwing aside", "Wow you have major main character syndrome. Your sister is allowed to be mad that her own mother and sibling might not be at her wedding. You sound very selfish. \nYTA", "You just figured out that you want to have a baby before you are 30 when you are already 29....\nI understand that conceiving is not always easy and that thoughts of having potential fertility issues are normal however waiting for 2 or 3 month would not have made a difference even if you were to experience issues. Your sister asked you to delay by 1 or 2 month not years so YTA and congratulations on also putting your own  mother in a difficult position. I hope she chooses to attend your sisters wedding and not be by your side should you go into labour around the time of her younger daughters wedding", "YTA.", "Yes, YTA. Were taking about delaying trying for one month. That's it. There was no real risk based on your age to waiting one single month to ensure the timelines were different. You agreed to be MOH and now you may not even be able to attend. You really were the selfish one here. It was one month. One month.", "You could have waited ONE month.... 4 weeks.\n\nListen... My kiddo is MY WORLD and we had several struggles with pregnancy,.so I understand how you want to get things going because so much can happen. But... 4 weeks. You could have waited Four. Dang. Weeks.", "YTA. Everyone\u2019s covered the reasons why but going forward, you need to tell your mom you want her to attend your sister\u2019s wedding (and all related events) even if you end up giving birth that same day/week, and do whatever else you can to ensure your sister\u2019s wedding is minimally disrupted. Don\u2019t schedule any baby showers/gender reveals close to pre-wedding events like the bachelorette party.", "YTA. Normally I am team \u201cpeople can\u2019t put their entire lives on hold for someone else\u2019s wedding,\u201d but it\u2019s really convenient that you and your husband just now decided you\u2019re ready to start trying and that it\u2019s important that you get pregnant now, all within the couple of month frame that would impact your sister\u2019s wedding. In that case, you absolutely could have waited.", "YTA!  All you had to do is wait maybe 1 to 2 months before actively trying to get pregnant.  Would that of been such a hardship? You\u2019re stealing your sister\u2019s spotlight.  How would you feel if the roles were reversed?  Now you\u2019ve put your mom in a bad spot.  If you go into labor around the wedding will you expect your mother to leave the wedding to be there?", "YTA. You signed up for it and your timing is a slap in the face.", "YTA only because you think youll still be at this wedding. Girl cmon. At least be honest about it.", "YTA. Her insinuating that you always have to make everything about yourself comes from somewhere. No doubt you want attention at HER wedding and that\u2019s why you so stubbornly chose to get pregnant right now instead of waiting 2 months.", "YTA.. You dont want to wait to have babies after 30 but wait until youre 29 to stat... and right after your sister said she was getting married? You are clearly trying to steal her spot light it wouldnt have made a difference for you to wait 1 month but it did make an already stressful event even more so.", "This was an asshole move on your part and I bet there\u2019s a history here of you being selfish. The LEAST you can do is insist that if you do go into labor, that your mother does not miss the wedding. That has to take priority. I hope you do this, otherwise you\u2019re a bigger asshole than I thought. YTA", "Sounds like sister held an olive branch out to her sister by asking her to be MOH and she just threw it back at her.\n\nOP, does that sound like YTA because to me it does.\n\nEdit: grammer", "YTA - and this feigned na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how you don\u2019t quite understand why she\u2019s so upset, *but she literally told you!*\n\nShe can\u2019t family plan for you, but damn you literally couldn\u2019t wait a month??? Anyone trying to get pregnant would know their prospective due date, **so you knew this would be the time where your birth would overlap!**\n\nNot only do you have a history of pulling focus, but you complete dismissed her concerns on to do exactly what\u2019s she was concerned about.\n\nYou don\u2019t care.\n\nYou\u2019re already married, so you\u2019re good there.\n\nYou\u2019re also having the first grandkid, so not only will that likely be the focus of her wedding day, her anniversary will always be second to your babies birthday.

If you had already been trying for awhile I would feel differently. You literally picked the one month to start trying that would mess with her wedding. You could have waited one cycle! Just one month! It seems awfully convenient that you decide suddenly you are ready to try the exact month that makes you due the time of the wedding....", "YTA. You could have waited 2 months. If you had difficulty conceiving, 2 months means nothing. \n\nYou need to give up your MOH duties. You also need to tell your sister and mother that her wedding is a priorit, and if you go into labor on her wedding day or the night before, you will accept that your mother can't be there, as she will be at your sister's wedding. That's the price you're going to pay for not waiting two months to start trying to conceive.", "Usy I'd say n t a. But something about your tone and wording does make it seem like this is. Just yoh and not about her. Especially when you say \"This isn't how I wanted my mom to find out about her first grandchild.\" \nLike, what did you think was gong to happen? Also, what's magical about having a bay before 30? Your eggs dont shrivel up and head to the nursing home the alday you hit 30. \nYTA.", "YTA I am 40w+4 days pregnant right now.

Then she literally said \u201cI will readjust our plans a bit!\u201d I didn\u2019t ask her to, and if she doesn\u2019t that\u2019s okay, but it was so thoughtful and instantly in that moment recognized that she cares about my event and her agreed role.

Unfortunately, YTA, and I\u2019d start thinking now about how you\u2019re gonna fix this to salvage your relationship with your sister.", "Slight YTA. You\u2019re gonna have to step down as MOH and let someone else take the role.", "I wish this wasn\u2019t a throwaway account so I could see OP\u2019s previous situations, I feel like it would provide so much context.", "Op\u2026What bridesmaid dress? \n\nYou can\u2019t be a MOH or even a bridesmaid with a due date on or near the wedding date. You have to step down. \n\nGirl, you basically just uninvited yourself to the wedding. You may barely get to guest status given your condition, and it\u2019s entirely dependent on if that baby stays in for the wedding. \n\nAll you had to do was wait one or two cycles\u2026 and you couldn\u2019t do that for your sister. \n\nIn the world of giving birth, you are a wildcard. You have no idea what\u2019s in store for you and neither do the doctors since it\u2019s your first time. \n\nExamples: \nI gave birth on my due date for the first one, and for the rest I have been consistently 10 days early. My SIL was 10 ten days late for her first and 1-4 days early for the rest. \n\nIf you give birth a week before, you probably will not be up for going to a wedding. If you go into labour that day, you will essentially steal the limelight and miss the wedding, and if you are about to give birth a few days later, you will probably not feel pretty great and will be digging deep to even get dressed and get to the couch in your own house. \n\nAnd you don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s twins or what kind of pregnancy you will be carrying. \n\nI wish you well in your pregnancy OP, but honestly, knowing that if you started trying 9 months to the day before your sister\u2019s wedding, you could get pregnant and but her and some people in the family in a bind, that makes you TA in my books. Especially when your sister accused you of always stealing the limelight and doing these kinds of things. \n\nYou have strained your relationship with your sister even more and don\u2019t you dare add any more stress to her by saying you will still be her MOH or a bridesmaid knowing you may need to duck out the literal day of the wedding leaving her high and dry. \n\nYTA", "YTA. I'd be furious.", "YTA. There's no 'slight' or 'soft' about it. Major AH.

Gosh, it was really going to kill you to let your sister have her day.\n\nYou're absolutely right that you don't have to put your life on hold for others. But there are indeed consequences for our actions, and part of those consequences is that you've severely damaged your relationship with your sister and will probably not be able to be the MOH. On top of this, you've put your mom in the horrible position of having to choose which special life event she will attend to if you give birth the day of the wedding. Your sister has every right to be pissed with you.", "YTA. \n\nYou have now made your sister\u2019s special day all about you, which from what your sister says, is something you often do. \n\nE.g. inviting mom and sis for lunch to announce you\u2019re going to start trying. That\u2019s so dramatic and ott. Speaks volumes about your need for attention.", "I hope she chooses to have a child free wedding and you\u2019re a week early.", "YTA. Your sister KNOWS you and it seems like she's sick and tired of you trying to steal the spotlight. \"Having kids before 30\" is such an arbitrary and pointless boundary to draw when you've been twiddling your thumbs until 29.

Her mind wouldn't go there if she wasn't already sick to death of your stunts. \n\nYou could have waited literally a couple of months. Whether it took you a month or a year to conceive, a couple of months wouldn't make a difference at all.

How about the fact that through *your* choices, your sister doesn't get to enjoy her engagement to the fullest? You know, like how I'm sure you had your family's undivided attention during *your* engagement?", "YTA, you could have waited 1-2 months and nothing would have been sacrificed.  You are the MOH, you are now pregnant, may be in labor for the wedding, god forbid you may be on bed rest, will have 1-2 baby showers, and as MOH it\u2019s your job to help with the wedding, plan the bachelorette party, plan the bridal shower, help with wedding day stuff, and likely be there for wedding dress shopping, maybe even go with her to pick flowers, decor, or various vendors alongside the bride, and your Mom, etc.  And the Bride being your sister, now your Mom will be divided up with your first pregnancy and your sister\u2019s wedding.  And will you be upset when it is not all about you, your first child, your parent\u2019s first grandchild, when they are doing the wedding related activities? What if you can\u2019t be at the wedding?  This was really selfish and short sighted.

It would be one thing if you found out you were pregnant unexpectedly right after agreeing to be MOH. HOWEVER, you had already agreed to this role, and couldn\u2019t be bothered to wait a few months before trying for a baby? I\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you weren\u2019t consciously being malicious, but dude, you\u2019re messed up.

Now you may have destroyed your relationship with your sister and ruined her day.", "YTA. It\u2019s the whole offering and/or accepting to be her MOH and then making this time completely conditional on YOUR milestone. That\u2019s seeking control, and you want control of all the attention.

So selfish.", "Info: can you give other examples of how you make everything about your self ?", "YTA and obviously clueless. She wasn\u2019t asking you to wait several years she literally said a month because she can do basic math. You\u2019re going to upstage her wedding either just having had a baby, not there because you\u2019re having a baby or gigantic pregnant. Either way you can\u2019t perform MOH duties.

You actively tried to get pregnant during the month that would put your due date in conflict with your sister's wedding. \n\nYea I've convinced myself, YTA.", "YTA and honestly I think you did it on purpose.", "YTA.  I was Matron of Honor for my little sister. I was  FORTY and held off a few months trying for our second bc I wanted to be there for my sister. You are MUCH younger than I was and your chances of getting pregnant are much easier than mine were. YTA bigtime", "Why does she feel you always make everything about you? YTA and I feel like there\u2019s more to this story.", "YTA for sure. You couldn't wait two more months? It's not like you knew you were going to start trying for kids and she decided to plan her wedding to inconvenience you. You decided out of the blue to actively try for kids and now she has to rework her wedding, not to mention that her special day is going to forever be overshadowed by the birth of your child when you literally could have waited a month. She's right, it was selfish of you.", "YTA not for getting pregnant but for agreeing to be MOH when you knew you would be trying and the dates might conflict.  \n\nYou should gracefully bow out of the wedding party and offer your sister an apology, honestly someone who is on their due date as part of a wedding party would steal focus from the day.  And\u2026 get your sister a hell of a wedding gift.", "If you were already pregnant before she asked you to wait, my judgement would have been different but she sincerely asked you to wait just for few months for the vary reasons other redditors are mentioning here already. I can understand why she's pissed and I don't even blame her. She also said that you do make things about yourself so she might have prior experience with you where you tried to grab attention on her special occasions? Even if that's not true, this time you really did that. YTA", "Sound like a professional thunder stealer", "While you can get pregnant at any time I feel the fact your sister said you make everything about your self. Makes me think you have a history of this. Honestly if you go into labor the day of or even the day before your sister big day will not be about her. A lot of guest on your side of the family may even leave or not attend the wedding. YTA", "YTA, I agree with pretty much everyone here. Your sister definitely did see this coming, and I hope you feel happy you've put your mum in this position. You can't be the MOH. Well done you. \n\nIf I were your mother, and I knew all of this, I'd commit to the wedding as babies come on their own schedule. Maybe she will make it, maybe she won't, if you wanted her at the hospital.", "I\u2019m surprised I\u2019m coming down on this side, but YTA. You seriously could have waited a couple of months.", "Lmao the worst thing that could have happened if you waited like 2 months is your baby being a Gemini.  You wanting to have a baby before you turn 30 is such a bullshit excuse.  I feel bad for your mom.  She might have to choose between being at your sister's wedding or your baby's birth.  I'm sure you would have been mad as hell if it was the other way around.  If you told her your due date and then she picked that weekend to get married you'd be bitching to Reddit about that!  YTA.  You need to apologize to your sister", "YTA simply for the \u201cI can\u2019t wait for two months when I\u2019m twenty-seven because I don\u2019t want to have a baby when I\u2019m thirty.\u201d\n\nDo you have the gestational timeframe of an elephant?", "YTA. Congratulations.", "It\u2019s this your first pregnancy? If so chances are your child comes later than expected (like 41 or 42 weeks instead of 40), so hopefully both you and your mom will be at the wedding, now for the verdict I\u2019d say soft YTA, being MOH is too much stress for a pregnant woman, you should step down from the role, maybe your sister\u2019s best friend or a close cousin could step up, but you can\u2019t do it anymore, between doctor appointments, hormones and the possibility of complications (there is always a possibility) it would be forcing yourself too much, it would add stress to your sister too, and you about to pop would steal some of the spotlight of your sister.", "YTA.", "YTA, but make it a soft one.\n\nYou have to make decisions right for you, that's cool. Starting a family is not a decision to be taken lightly or second guessed. However ... yeah. A few months wouldn't have been a huge sacrifice since you've put it off until it's convenient for you and hubby financially - but sister is not worth that consideration and level of planning.\n\nI notice you kind of emphasized  wanting to have a baby before 30 - it's just a number, you know that, right? a few months is very little time in the grand scheme of things. Your sister made a reasonable request IMO and you didn't even think twice about dismissing her perspective. You made a commitment to your sister and you can't predict what your pregnancy will look like at that time or how you will be feeling. What if you're on bedrest trying to do your MOH duties or can't be at the wedding? You did a stellar job predicting how long it would take to get pregnant.\n\nHonestly the more I'm thinking about this, the more I'm just thinking you were being more selfish than I originally thought.", "Yeah you told her that just because your estimated due date is her wedding doesn't mean it will happen - like you told her not to worry because you probably wouldn't get pregnant right away.  \n\nYou are such an asshole.  Since you *allegedly* didn't think you'd get pregnant right away - you could have waited a couple of months and it wouldn't have made one bit of difference - if you did or didn't have trouble - it's a couple of months.  Your sister's reaction also tells me this isn't the first time you've done shit like this and it's a regular occurrence for you to treat her this way.\n\nThis is nothing but blatant attention seeking, knowing that your baby showers and all the other crap that goes along with it will steal focus from wedding stuff.  In addition, all of the things that need to be done as the MOH, you will be otherwise occupied and someone else will have to take on those things.  AND you're putting your mother in a position to have to choose what she goes to and who she goes with.  You're terrible.", "YTA. You should have absolutely waited. It's incredibly selfish. Now, what should be a moment for your sister is overshadowed by you. You owe her an apology and need to rethink why you felt the need to take the spotlight away from your sister.", "YTA - majorly. I feel so badly for your sister.", "YTA. and you didn\u2019t even make it past the first trimester yet, so don\u2019t gloat too much.", "Soft YTA, I understand wanting a baby, but your sister was 100% correct on everything. This was kinda a selfish move. She also said you always Mae everything about you. Is there a history of you stealing her spotlight?", "YTA only because you didn't check the calculations first and figured out you only needed to wait 30 days", "YTA\n\nDude, you agreed to be the MOH and she asked to wait 2 Months! A mere 2 months! That's not bridezilla unreasonable, it would have also made it easy to hold to your duties as a maid of honor. \n\nEven if you weren't the maid of honor, quite possibly missing your sister's wedding not because you accidentally got pregnant is one thing... But because you started trying basically 9 months before the wedding date... Peak weird time to decide on that.\n\nAgain TWO MONTHS.\n\nBut nope you couldn't wait.", "Success in that first month would result in a 100% certainty of fucking over the wedding and failing in your MOH duties (you'd be absent or exhausted). Lack of success in that first month in no way increases future chances of pregnancy so I'm baffled by your logic of starting early in case you hit problems.\n\nYour sister is right to be furious. You've gone ahead and done the ONE THING GUARANTEED to right royally screw her over and mess with her big day. Not to mention stealing her thunder if baby arrives before the wedding.\n\nMassive AH. All you can do now is withdraw from MOH role and hope someone else can take over.", "YTA for all the reasons everyone mentioned... PLUS  throwing \"trouble conceiving\" in at the end like it's an afterthought or rationalization.\n\nIf you've never been TTC you don't know you have trouble conceiving and \"putting my life on hold\" is like the worst possible frame of mind for fertility issues plus insulting for those who actually had fertility issues.", "There\u2019s no science behind conceiving especially if OP was on BC. It took me 6 months to conceive my baby and then I didn\u2019t stop getting pregnant. Op is lucky she must have read the books that said plan to wait 6 months to a year before you can conceive.  It just happens. I also wanted to have my child before I was 30 so I understand her reasoning behind not waiting.", "Nta. I'm questioning why my answer is not the norm here? Maybe because I struggle with infertility (just finished my fourth egg retrieval) my perspective is different?\n\nYour sister's wedding is important but so is your pregnancy. Why should you put your life on hold to help her feel less insecure on her wedding day? Why should she feel her wedding is ruined because her sister is pregnant? This is all bizarre to me. I'd be thrilled for my pregnant sister. You do you and good luck with your pregnancy.", "NTA at all. I\u2019m not putting my life on hold for a wedding. I\u2019m not going to not get pregnant or arrange my pregnancy around someone\u2019s wedding. This is some next level silliness.", "I can't believe these responses. NTA. Come on. OP is nearing 30. The time to start trying for a baby is now, now, now. If she has fertility problems she needs to find that out and get on it from the perspective of her health, the baby's health, and her chances of having a baby at all. I wasn't a bridesmaid in my sister's weddings and they weren't in mine. We love each other but we each had close friends play that role.

Brings out the best and worst in people. I have a rule: You have to treat good news like good news. Even if it's untimely. Because so much bad stuff is just waiting for us in life.

Sure, but the chances of getting pregnant your first month are super low. You had no clue it would work or how fertile you are.\n\nPlus, I don\u2019t want this to happen, but you don\u2019t even know if it\u2019ll make it full term.

You are entitled to live your life. Your sister doesn\u2019t get to control your body for a year.

You cannot be expected to put your life on hold for someone else\u2019s wedding whether or not you\u2019ve agreed to be apart of the wedding party. Plus, most of the time someone suffers from infertility it\u2019s because of an unknown reason & not diagnosed until after a year of trying. Unless OP has had multiple pregnancies before this how was she supposed to know how fertile she was? It takes healthy couple up to a year to conceive and I will forever die of this hill that you can\u2019t plan your life around others live events. \n\nSide note, my cousin thought it would be a good idea to put off trying for a baby around their work schedule & when they were over a year in & finally got around to fertility testing they found an 8 lb ovarian tumor that was cancerous. Had they not put off trying they could have found her cancer a lot sooner. \n\nIt\u2019s not selfish to start trying for a baby based off your own timeline.", "YTA. I don\u2019t blame your sister, you had 1 job. Show up for your sister and support/help her as the MOH. Baby could of came anytime after that. I feel this was very intentional.", "NTA- your sister is being immature. But I guess some people put a lot into wanting to be the most special on their wedding day?

Your just you.", "NTA. Fertility is not guaranteed, you start trying when you are ready. If someone else has to be the maid of honor, so be it.

She should be HAPPY for you in the moment..not thinking about how it could /possibly/ distract from her wedding. \n\nIn the tryingforababy forum, they tell you all the time DO NOT PUT PLANS ON HOLD FOR A BABY!!!

It would have been smarter to just do your thing and announce the pregnancy if that happened.", "NTA from me. I just don\u2019t understand all this pomp and circumstance over weddings now.

Bring a part of someone else\u2019s wedding should not become your only reason for living.", "NTA people live their\nLives uniquely to their situation. It is silly to expect someone not to try to conceive due to a wedding. You must also understand that your sister and your family are committed to the wedding.

She and her husband were supposed to be in the wedding. She ended up delivering the day of the wedding!  She went early because she was pregnant with twins but they didn\u2019t know; it was the 80\u2019s.

You had every reason to want to start getting pregnant. Wether it is true or not, social views have settled on 30 being the age when pregnancy gets difficult. Further more IVF specialists are less likely to help with fertility issue the old a women is. So because of that starting as early as possible was the most logical choice for you.\nAlternatively, sister has every right to be upset. You did agree to being to MOH, so I can see why that is a let down to her. You did, however, give her enough notice to change plans or remove you as MOH. Also she did voice this exact concern, and although it was a long shot, it did happen. This makes it perfectly valid for her to make the \u201ci told you so\u201d claim.", "NTA\n\nNo one knows how long it will take to get pregnant.

You both can still plan for you to attend even if its by video phone. How beautiful a baby and a wedding to celebrate. Your family is truly blessed. But if it's a girl you have to name her after your sister", "YTA. You really should have worked under the assumption that you might get pregnant right away. It would not have made much difference in your age or fertility if you'd waited just three months to start trying. You can't change this now, but what you can do is apologize to your sister, be up front with your mom and insist that your mom attend your sister's wedding no matter when the baby decides to come.", "YTA I generally believe that major life decisions shouldn't be based around someone else's wedding, this is the one case I disagree. You agreed to be her MOH and conveniently you decide to get pregnant exactly when it would for sure make you and possibly family members miss the wedding, and the attention leading up to the wedding will be split to you. \n\nYour sister even pointed out if you got pregnant now that you would be due on her wedding, why couldn't you just wait like 1 month? It sounds like you've already been waiting awhile so whats 1 more month so you could honor your previous commitment and not steal the spotlight from your sister. It really sounds like you did this on purpose so everything could be about you, and your sisters comment seems like this isn't the first time either.", "Yta", "YTA - Don't agree to be the MOH if you have zero intent of following through.

You could have waited 1 month", "If her date was set, especially if you\u2019re in the wedding, before you tried to conceive, you are the asshole.", "YTA. Totally on your sisters side.", "Jfc YTA. And her comment about you always needing to make things about you solidified my answer for me. I was weighing it out until I read that part. You come across as very narcissistic and self centered. You\u2019re playing the naive trope and acting innocent, but you knew exactly what you were doing. Your poor sister doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s been able to have one moment to herself without you butting in. This was HER day, HER milestone, and you\u2019ve robbed her.

Okay, tell your sis you understand if she wants to reassign MOH that you understand (I was 7th bridesmaid of 8). Explain you understand that your mom might be conflicted but that it's her choice ( you and your partner draw up your birth plan and you might not even want your mother present during the \"messy\" part). \n\nThe truth is this: you and your sister are both building your futures.

OP is right that she shouldn\u2019t have to put her life on hold. But this wasn\u2019t asking for years, it was just a couple months which was easily doable. If they\u2019re in a place where they can now start trying, I don\u2019t really see anything major happening in two-three months that would affect that. And if her sister threw this in her face, then OP must have a habit of stealing the spotlight from her sister. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she went LC with her if not NC. I would if I were her.", "The part that gets me is that OPs sister didn't tell their mum why they had the argument. She still respected that it was not for her to announce OPs pregnancy, especially to explain an argument that would have given people reason to potentially side with her. From that alone, she seems like a reasonable person.", "I agree with all of this, and also it seems so weird to me that she took her mom and sister out to a meal to tell them she and her husband were going to *start trying* for a baby?? That... just... who does that? It seems kind of attention-seeky to me.", "Yeah, I was a little torn too. But settled on YTA as well. \n\nOn the one hand, I\u2019m sick of all of the \u201call of the attention needs to be on me and me alone, and no one else can live their lives if it interferes with my main character syndrome spotlight\u201d posts in regard to weddings, proposals and pregnancies. If sis was asking OP not to get pregnant until after her \u201cbig day\u201d because it had to all be about her, then I would be firmly set in NTA territory. \n\nOn the other hand, it would take less than a minute to figure out that getting pregnant *now* would likely have the birth *directly* interfering with the wedding. Like she could go into labor *at* the wedding for crying out loud, even if the baby is a week early or late, that\u2019s not really better. A week early and she loses her MOH last minute, and her parents are too preoccupied with a new baby to pay attention to rehearsal dinners and such, a week later and everyone is gonna be talking about OP being ready to pop, and she\u2019d be so uncomfortable the whole day she\u2019d do a crappy job as MOH anyway. \n\nIf OP, cared about her sister she would have taken that *minute* to do the math and waited 2-3 months, which would have made *no* difference in their long term goals. Whether or not they ended up having trouble conceiving. \n\nSo, ya OP you were being selfish. It would have been one thing if it was a surprise, these things happen. But you specifically planned for this, which is what makes you TA in my book. There\u2019s nothing you can do about it now though, so be a good sister, apologize, and excuse yourself from the wedding party. In the meantime, do your best to help your sister *now* in any way you can to show that you do actually care about her and her wedding.  You\u2019re not gonna be much good to her once the wedding gets close, so make up for it now before you\u2019re too far along.", "Oh but OP had to have a baby before she turned 30. Sheesh. OP, YTA.", "Yep. No way you'll be able to be MOH. And it would be a miracle if you even made it to the wedding at all. If the baby is born a week or two before, you'll be in no shape to want to attend a wedding, especially with a newborn in tow. And if you're late, you will have a hard time going to the ceremony let alone sticking around for a big meal and speeches afterward.", "Yep, big YTA.
