We were in a friend group and almost everyone would basically obsess and worship over her it wasn\u2019t healthy, almost all of them ended up dating her and they were all super toxic to me and her which ruined both our mental health in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL and sent us both spiraling downhill.\n\nYears later she lives in Kentucky and we don\u2019t speak to any of the people in that friend group except for each other but in the past years she\u2019s been going down a hill of despair.

(I was not around but her friends were talking about it.)\n\nSome time ago when she had just moved back to Kentucky she introduced me to her best friend online and we all became the best of friends. But once my friend went into their downhill despair pit their devices would constantly be taken away so we couldn\u2019t contact or do anything for months but her friend in Kentucky wouldn\u2019t get her stuff taken away and at the time I didn\u2019t really have friends so I would talk to her. My friend and my friends friend had known each other and been besties since they were like 5 but recently they stopped being friends because my friend was being an a-hole.

They had been cutting and their friend just wanted to help as they\u2019d cut before but instead they yelled at them and stopped being friends. I know they have terrible mental health but I still can\u2019t see what they did was right or just as they have not made an attempt to fix it after months.

Rather about the bad things she\u2019s done. Remember you are all in different positions. You don\u2019t know what she goes through at home.\n\nIt\u2019s ok to have someone familiar with the situation to vent to. When someone\u2019s mental health is affecting yours, it\u2019s best to step away. You sound young. This is a hard lesson often taught by experience. Always take care of yourself first. If you want to help her than you need your own strength and mental fortitude to be able to handle her if she lashes out, ONLY so that it doesn\u2019t affect how you feel about yourself.\n\nIt can be hard to learn to accept you have a problem and need help. Maybe she needs professional help? I wouldn\u2019t go as far as talking to her parents behind her back, but if you think that she is at risk for hurting herself more seriously, you should definitely talk to your own parents for guidance. Everyone will be grateful to you.", "YTA.  THIS. Absolutely. There is no need to kick someone when they are down. If she isn\u2019t your friend, let her go. If she is, be supportive. Would you like someone to talk behind your back and pretend friendship?"]}
