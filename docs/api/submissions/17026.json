When she lost her hair, she was understandably completely devastated and inconsolable. No matter what I tried to do or say to comfort her or help her, nothing helped. I brought up shaving my head to support her and she was very excited about the idea and kept telling me how sweet it was of me and how happy she was I\u2019d be willing to do something like that for her. Avery didn\u2019t want to be the one to shave my head, so I had my older brother help me with it. We pulled a chair out to the back porch and shaved my hair off. Afterwards, when I looked at myself in the mirror, I didn\u2019t recognize myself and got really spooked and caught off guard. I didn\u2019t want to get upset in front of Avery because I didn\u2019t want her to feel bad, so I went to to the bathroom. I cried for a couple minutes, but pulled myself together pretty quick. I wasn\u2019t upset about cutting my hair, I think I just felt really different and wasn\u2019t used to it. I came out of the bathroom and went to give Avery a hug, but before I could she said that my eyes were bloodshot and asked me what was wrong. I said nothing because I didn\u2019t want to upset her, but she got mad and started crying and called me a liar and said I don\u2019t get any right to react this way because I get a choice and I\u2019m a guy so I shouldn\u2019t be emotional about my hair. I tried to tell her I wasn\u2019t upset about my hair and that I just freaked out because I didn\u2019t recognize myself, and I tried to apologize, but she was still really mad. She said that me being upset about not having hair implied that I thought she looked bad without hair and that being bald was a bad thing. I tried to tell her I don\u2019t think that and still think she\u2019s so beautiful and tried to apologize again but she yelled at me to shut up. I feel like such a douchebag. I never wanted to hurt her, she\u2019s genuinely the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me and I adore her.

You put the effort in and it was very sweet. Your heart was absolutely in the right place", "Nah.  Clearly this is heavy for both of you.  I still remember getting my head shaved for basic training.   I had never seen myself without hair before and it wigged me out.  Had to fight a tear myself and I was never super attached to my hair either.  It was just weird to not recognize the guy I was seeing in the mirror for a moment.", "NAH for being upset. It's a very emotional time, speaking as a cancer survivor, both for the ill person and those around them. I'm sure your gf's emotions are all over the place, along with a hefty dose of anxiety.

If this is recent, she probably just needs some time to cool down and recollect herself.

Bottom line: you did nothing wrong and I am sorry your girlfriend reacted that way.", "Nah, no way! NTA at all. Your a very sweet guy doing a really sensitive thing. These kind of misunderstandings just happen sometimes.", "NTA. Almost anyone is less than pleased seeing themselves bald for the first time (including Yul Bryner, star of The King And I, who was told to shave before he played it.

You are to be commended for actively supporting your woman in time of immense need.", "NAH - you\u2019re both riding a really big wave, youre both entitled to be upset and sad about whatever you\u2019re feeling.

Also, men can be just as attached to their hair as women.\n\nShe's not an AH though as she's got a lot going on and your reaction likely triggered some stuff she's not dealt with by telling herself it's fine. I hope she's getting psychotherapeutic help as this would be a difficult time for anyone.", "NAH\n\nYou both need to take time to process your feelings. Hopefully by the time both of you have calmed down you can have a conversation with her. \n\nYour feelings are valid. You being overwhelmed by this change doesn't mean you are a liar about wanting to support your girlfriend. In fact, I think this experience can help you understand how scary and overwhelming your girlfriend's situation is now that you get to experience a part of it. \n\nAt the same time I feel that your girlfriend's reaction probably comes from the very stressful situation she's in. I'm not saying what she said is right and that yoy have to just accept whatever she says tho.\n\nI hope you guys reconcile soon!", "NAH  She's not acting appropriately, but she is going through a big grief and trauma, so I really don't feel comfortable quite calling her an AH for her own emotional reactions and not knowing how to work through them at her age.  I hope she has some time to cool down and is able to come around.\n\nYou are not at all an AH for having your own emotions.  You did your best to take them out of her space, and I am glad she has a boyfriend willing to take such solidarity with her.  But you still have a right to your feelings.  You are not an AH for crying.  I'm sorry this is causing conflict with her.  Do you think there may be any mutual friends or trusted adults that can help you navigate this with her?", "NTA \n\nA big part of her anger and hurt is the disease talking. Try to be patient and keep supporting her. Leave her alone for a little while, say a few hours or something. She'll eventually cool down. \n\nShe's going through a lot right now. It's something that you can't really understand. I'm a hospice nurse and the emotions are often like a roller coaster. You didn't do anything \"wrong\" I assure you. She just lashed out. You're being great by showing her the love you have for her no matter what.", "NTA you both are very emotional. She is going through a very tough time so at times her anger is going to possibly displaced.  She didn\u2019t have a choice in losing your hair but you chose to shave your head for her but she did not want you to be emotional about it", "Nah. She\u2019s going thru a lot and change is scary in general. It was just a hard moment. Keep showing up.", "NTA. I think your intentions were good, and you didn't expect to react the way you did. But being honest about it was very good. That being said, i wouldn't say anything more than that you're sorry. Here's the thing, you see her as beautiful, you didn't care about her hair falling out, but you know that she did. You watched that. You can shave and cut all day, it will start to come back immediately. She has to live with it without it coming back, maybe ever, while facing a lot of healing or the opposite in the coming months. She doesn't give a shit about your hair, you still have it, as far as she's concerned. She doesn't want to be mimicked out of pity, so there's that too, not that you intended that. If she comes out of this fine, and with hair, years from now, it will be a memory she'll flip you shit about. Don't expect her to care that you're NTA, she's NTA either, she's going through fucking chemo.", "NTA", "NAH. You're both young and it's hard to deal with emotional maturity when your hormones still haven't settled. It's even worse when you're going through cancer treatment. However, having cancer doesn't mean no one around you gets to not have emotions. You did the best you could and I wish her well in treatment.", "It sounds like maybe you had a little moment of seeing some of the same feeling she has faced over her hair, and it was upsetting.  Try putting it that way - you got a small taste of how she has probably felt about losing her hair, and it was hard.  It was only a small taste, but it was still strange and upsetting and a little scary.  You get to have some feelings over that.  Yes, it\u2019s not the big things she\u2019s facing, but the reason that what you did is supportive is because it is choosing to take a bite of the bitter meal she\u2019s forced to endure - doing something that does change what you look like and how the world sees you.  You chose to do that to stand with her, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t affect you.  If it didn\u2019t affect you, it wouldn\u2019t have much meaning.\n\nHaving said that, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s TA either.  I don\u2019t think she really understands that even if what you\u2019ve chosen to do is a much smaller portion of what she\u2019s been forced to do, they are related.  And I suspect she doesn\u2019t understand because her struggle and the losses forced on her are so big and loud and hard right now that it\u2019s hard for her to see or hear anyone else struggling. NAH.", "Your gf sounds like quite TA and if she pushes you to the point you leave she has no one to blame but herself", "NTA. Nothing gives her the right to dismiss and belittle your feelings. Not even cancer.\n\nAnd the whole \u201ccut your hair for me\u201d is bullshit. It\u2019s one thing if you do it out of solidarity. But she basically wants you to suffer the same way she is, but also suppress your suffering so that all the attention is on her.\n\nYou\u2019re both 17, so a lack of emotional intelligence is understandable. But if she doesn\u2019t apologize after calming down, I\u2019d rethink the relationship. You can do better than someone who will drag you down with them.", "I don't see how shaving heads does anything to support cancer. I'm not trying to be horrible,  but i seriously dont see how.

Both of you go through a lot rn. It's okay to feel whatever you also feel.

Thank you for being such a supportive person and going through with shaving to support your girlfriend. It's very kind of you to make the decision to do this.", "NAH (it would be N T A except she has cancer so is dealing with a lot). \n\nMost of therapy in late life comes down to \u201cspent too long pushing emotions out of the way rather than letting yourself experience them & figure out a way to deal rather than hiding\u201d - so it\u2019s really, really important that you do not learn the lesson here that \u201csometimes it\u2019s wrong to feel the thing that you are feeling\u201d. \n\nYour girlfriend is just entirely & absolutely wrong about that part. \n\nBut the \u201cnext bit\u201d is where you can both learn a bit & potentially get closer over it. \n\nI would say that the fact that you had this unexpected emotional reaction is actually *awesome* in terms of offering her support with what she is going through. \n\nThat\u2019s actually amazing - because if you hadn\u2019t shaved your head alongside her, you wouldn\u2019t have known that that kind of unexpected emotional reaction was a thing. But having experienced it, it can make you more sympathetic to what she is going through, and better able to support her. \n\nAnd the second angle is that you can also both talk about how her reaction shows that she is probably feeling overwhelmed with dealing with her own stuff, and has no \u201cresources\u201d left for dealing with other people\u2019s problems. \n\nWhich is understandable for a period of time & with good reason - it\u2019s part of the \u201cfor better or worse\u201d commitment in a relationship - sometimes things are not equal, because of what you are going through. \n\nI know that when I\u2019m struggling with life I find it much harder to support my partner with his struggles.\n\nAnd you are both young, and she is going through a LOT - so it will be hard for her to find that level of maturity to allow you to have some \u201cneeds\u201d on occasion. \n\nBut for things to stay healthy between you, she needs to at least acknowledge that you have a right to your emotions / reactions, even if she cannot personally provide you support with them. \n\nAnd you need to make sure you have a support system in place. Google \u201ccaregiver burn out\u201d and how to avoid it. \n\nGood luck. This will be hard. But done well (with support) you will both be better off for the things you learn along the way.", "NAH.\n\nIf anything, you being upset about losing your hair makes you more understanding of how hard it is for her.  Going through something like hair loss *does* hurt, which is why you shaving your head to support her is meaningful in the first place.  Try to explain to her that while you're not in her exact situation, feeling upset about your experience makes you much more empathetic of her and what she's going through.  It's not about beauty--for a lot of people their hair is very much tied to their identity and autonomy.  She is going through a lot right now, so it is understandable that seeing someone else cry about hair loss triggered a lot of negative emotions.  Talking with her again when you're both calmer and explaining how much she means to you, and how much your gesture of support reflects that will hopefully clear the air and bring you two closer together.  I wish you both the best.", "Exactly, NAH .", "This says it all.", "I\u2019unno, I was one of those kids who was blonde and turned brunette, and I put it off with tons of highlights and bleach for the longest time. There were times right after I let it go brown / cut off residual highlights and the mirror just\u2026 didn\u2019t look like me. I wouldn\u2019t say shock, but some level of upset, yeah. Things Are Not Correct. It\u2019s hard to explain but I understand OP feeling off.

Also understandable that she was upset by your reaction, and while she was wrong to invalidate your feelings she was right that it is different for women. Thanks to society for many of us a lot of self-worth is tied to our image and hair is a huge component of that for a lot of women. Haircare is deeply engrained in girl culture. Even though your experiences are different and hers may be more intense because of this and the involuntary nature of her hair loss, it doesn't make your feelings any less valid or significant though and she should apologize for invalidating you when she calms down. You had no way of knowing you would react this way and you're not an AH for having feelings, and she's not an AH for being upset by your reaction but is maybe a little bit for invalidating you. I honestly don't think I'd want my SO to shave with me because I don't think any reaction to it would make me feel better and I say this as someone with a shaved head. It's very sensitive for me and even seeing videos of women voluntarily shaving their heads because they *want* to be rid of their hair makes me irrationally angry because it feels so unfair. It's just tough. You didn't do anything wrong and there probably wasn't a way for this to play out without her being overwhelmed. The best thing you can do for now is make her feel beautiful as is, not \"despite\" this.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong, however she did by dismissing your feelings.

You're allowed to feel that way about yourself and while it's a difficult time for her, I don't think it's fair to call you names and yell at you.", "No one ITA here\u2026 she\u2019s understandably sensitive right now, she\u2019s going through a lot. No, she shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you or called you names, and after she calmed down I hope she apologized. But you are entitled to feel how you feel about your appearance and that does not affect your image of her. I hope she realizes that now\u2026 just because you\u2019re a guy doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t care about your looks. Seeing yourself look so different so suddenly can be jarring, and she will undoubtedly feel the same way when she shaves hers. I understand where she is coming from- she\u2019s expecting you to be strong and shave your head to show her it\u2019s not so bad. By your reaction, she feels as if you\u2019re saying shaved hair is ugly, therefore she is ugly. I\u2019m positive she doesn\u2019t actually think this.

Remember you are a safe person for her to let off steam to.

The idea is that wherever you are in relation to the patient, support goes inward but dump outward.

You are expecting too much of yourself - to be perfect for your gf.\n\nI know she's going through so very much. Her emotions can be extreme as she fights this extreme fight. Plus, chemotherapy can affect one's personality, too. Her response to you was incredibly unempathetic, unkind, and self-centered, and you know that's not typical of your gf, then you can cut her slack and give her grace. It's the cancer and the chemo talking. I hope it's not your gf just being herself.\n\nEither way, her reaction was so very wrong. (That is why I say NTA.)

Losing a piece of your personal identity (whether it's physical or mental or emotional) CAN BE devastating for anyone. **Just because she had no choice and you actually chose to experience that loss doesn't mean it was less traumatic for you.** Her own grief and pain may have blinded her to that, but the truth remains. Your heart is HUGE. You feel so very deeply. You know in your heart how devastating her losing her hair is and that is why you offered to share that experience with her.\n\nI know you are focused on being there for your gf, but you must also take care of you. Let your brother, your parents, your friends, etc. be there for you. Give yourself a break. Neither you nor your gf - nor anyone else - needs to be perfect, CAN be perfect. There is no such thing as perfect because what's perfect for one is not going to be perfect for someone else.\n\nHugs to you.", "NTA. Her reaction was very self-centred, which given the circumstances may be understandable, but that doesn't make what she said or did okay.\n\nA lot of comments are rightfully pointing out that she is going through something pretty extreme so that's definitely contributed to her response. That being said, she needs to realise that she was in the wrong and apologise, which hopefully she will! If she doesn't though, and insists that you've done this really awful thing when you haven't, unfortunately I don't see how that's not abusive, even in these circumstances. To dismiss your feelings because your a guy is just plain sexist as well. We don't do that anymore.\n\nYou were trying to do something very considerate and nice. It's a shame that she's taken you showing the slightest bit of feeling about your own hair having ruined the whole thing is sad. I'm disappointed for you. I hope she will reflect and apologise to you soon. You seem like a thoughtful and sensitive guy so I hope you end up getting the credit you deserve", "NAH, also we often cry about one thing but we legitimately thinks it\u2019s about another thing. You are 17 and dealing with a loved one who has cancer at 17. This is a very real reason to reach out to someone for help. Speaking to a counsellor regularly can help you. You might gain some skills in recognizing your own feelings and dealing with them properly while also learning to communicate in a way that helps your girlfriend understand what you\u2019re feeling, without escalating into a disagreement. \n\nHonestly she should be in counselling too. At 17 it\u2019s normal to believe that every situation has a \u201cway you should feel, a way you should react\u201d but becoming an adult means that you learn all the ways that feelings happen and how to properly deal with them.", "This is a terrible situation all around for 17 year olds. You are well within your rights to have had a moment of vulnerability and she shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you. All I\u2019ll say is that chemo absolutely wrecks you physically and emotionally, almost as bad as the cancer itself does. She was projecting, she didn\u2019t mean it, I\u2019m sure of that", "NAH.", "NAH. I'm a woman who had chemo long ago and lost my hair during treatment. That was, by far, the worst thing about my cancer diagnosis and treatment. Worse than the possibility of death, worse than feeling like shit after each round of chemo, worse than the 100s of tests they do to make sure you can survive chemo, worse than having all my finger and toenails fall off, worse than the surgery, worse than months of radiation treatments.\n\nIt's a lot for both of you. Hopefully you can give each other some grace about it. Personally I didn't want anyone shaving their head in solidarity because it just would have been one more reminder and other people being bald didn't make me less bald. But everyone reacts differently and it's hard for both of you. She's feeling things she never expected to feel and it's just hard to cope.", "The sexism here is disgusting. She doesn't get to use OP as an emotional punching bag nor does she get to dictate how he reacts because \"he's a man.\" You need to examine yourself and why you seem to think emotional abuse is okay.", "I agree, but I don't think she's TA. She's going through a lot, and she's also only 17.", "This!"]}
