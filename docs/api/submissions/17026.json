When she lost her hair, she was understandably completely devastated and inconsolable. No matter what I tried to do or say to comfort her or help her, nothing helped. I brought up shaving my head to support her and she was very excited about the idea and kept telling me how sweet it was of me and how happy she was I\u2019d be willing to do something like that for her. Avery didn\u2019t want to be the one to shave my head, so I had my older brother help me with it. We pulled a chair out to the back porch and shaved my hair off. Afterwards, when I looked at myself in the mirror, I didn\u2019t recognize myself and got really spooked and caught off guard. I didn\u2019t want to get upset in front of Avery because I didn\u2019t want her to feel bad, so I went to to the bathroom. I cried for a couple minutes, but pulled myself together pretty quick. I wasn\u2019t upset about cutting my hair, I think I just felt really different and wasn\u2019t used to it. I came out of the bathroom and went to give Avery a hug, but before I could she said that my eyes were bloodshot and asked me what was wrong. I said nothing because I didn\u2019t want to upset her, but she got mad and started crying and called me a liar and said I don\u2019t get any right to react this way because I get a choice and I\u2019m a guy so I shouldn\u2019t be emotional about my hair. I tried to tell her I wasn\u2019t upset about my hair and that I just freaked out because I didn\u2019t recognize myself, and I tried to apologize, but she was still really mad. She said that me being upset about not having hair implied that I thought she looked bad without hair and that being bald was a bad thing. I tried to tell her I don\u2019t think that and still think she\u2019s so beautiful and tried to apologize again but she yelled at me to shut up. I feel like such a douchebag. I never wanted to hurt her, she\u2019s genuinely the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me and I adore her.

Take a deep breath and do your best to support her. \n\nI think what you are both doing to show your love for each other is beautiful.", "NTA - she\u2019s dealing with some really difficult stuff and she is likely much easier to upset than normal. Pain and sickness make it harder to cope with every day things. \n\nI hope she has some times to reflect and realize what happened later. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough job to support people through medical illness. You put the effort in and it was very sweet. Your heart was absolutely in the right place", "Nah.  Clearly this is heavy for both of you.  I still remember getting my head shaved for basic training.   I had never seen myself without hair before and it wigged me out.  Had to fight a tear myself and I was never super attached to my hair either.  It was just weird to not recognize the guy I was seeing in the mirror for a moment.", "NAH for being upset. It's a very emotional time, speaking as a cancer survivor, both for the ill person and those around them. I'm sure your gf's emotions are all over the place, along with a hefty dose of anxiety. Keep communicating with each other, and reassuring her. My best wishes to her.", "NAH. She's just frustrated and scared. You have every right to be emotional too. Just be there for her as you have been. It's all you can do.", "NTA. Cancer doesn\u2019t give you a pass to dismiss others feelings. Both your feelings are valid. Let her calm down and you can talk about it", "NTA but your girlfriend is definitely deserving of some empathy. Your feelings about your hair are completely valid. If this is recent, she probably just needs some time to cool down and recollect herself. It sounds like a projection of her own feelings, which, regardless of where they come from, you don\u2019t deserve. Bottom line: you did nothing wrong and I am sorry your girlfriend reacted that way.", "Nah, no way! NTA at all. Your a very sweet guy doing a really sensitive thing. These kind of misunderstandings just happen sometimes.", "NTA. Almost anyone is less than pleased seeing themselves bald for the first time (including Yul Bryner, star of The King And I, who was told to shave before he played it. He went on to do the show 1,200 times in his life, so I guess he got over the initial shock). You are to be commended for actively supporting your woman in time of immense need.", "NAH - you\u2019re both riding a really big wave, youre both entitled to be upset and sad about whatever you\u2019re feeling. Understandable that emotions are high for her\u2026 and for you too! \n\nPlease don\u2019t stop feeling things when they arise, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that stuff!", "NAH\n\nThis is tough on you both. Good on you for trying your best to support her. She needs to reconsider her reaction to your emotions, but it is really hard for people who are very sick to understand that their illness impacts others.", "NAH\n\nYou being upset about your hair does not mean you think she looks bad without hair, that's her inaccurate opinion based on her own projected beliefs. Also, men can be just as attached to their hair as women.\n\nShe's not an AH though as she's got a lot going on and your reaction likely triggered some stuff she's not dealt with by telling herself it's fine. I hope she's getting psychotherapeutic help as this would be a difficult time for anyone.", "NAH\n\nYou both need to take time to process your feelings. Hopefully by the time both of you have calmed down you can have a conversation with her. \n\nYour feelings are valid. You being overwhelmed by this change doesn't mean you are a liar about wanting to support your girlfriend. In fact, I think this experience can help you understand how scary and overwhelming your girlfriend's situation is now that you get to experience a part of it. \n\nAt the same time I feel that your girlfriend's reaction probably comes from the very stressful situation she's in. I'm not saying what she said is right and that yoy have to just accept whatever she says tho.\n\nI hope you guys reconcile soon!", "NAH  She's not acting appropriately, but she is going through a big grief and trauma, so I really don't feel comfortable quite calling her an AH for her own emotional reactions and not knowing how to work through them at her age.  I hope she has some time to cool down and is able to come around.\n\nYou are not at all an AH for having your own emotions.  You did your best to take them out of her space, and I am glad she has a boyfriend willing to take such solidarity with her.  But you still have a right to your feelings.  You are not an AH for crying.  I'm sorry this is causing conflict with her.  Do you think there may be any mutual friends or trusted adults that can help you navigate this with her?", "NTA \n\nA big part of her anger and hurt is the disease talking. Try to be patient and keep supporting her. Leave her alone for a little while, say a few hours or something. She'll eventually cool down. \n\nShe's going through a lot right now. It's something that you can't really understand. I'm a hospice nurse and the emotions are often like a roller coaster. You didn't do anything \"wrong\" I assure you. She just lashed out. You're being great by showing her the love you have for her no matter what.", "NTA you both are very emotional. She is going through a very tough time so at times her anger is going to possibly displaced.  She didn\u2019t have a choice in losing your hair but you chose to shave your head for her but she did not want you to be emotional about it", "Nah. She\u2019s going thru a lot and change is scary in general. It was just a hard moment. Keep showing up.", "NTA. I think your intentions were good, and you didn't expect to react the way you did. But being honest about it was very good. That being said, i wouldn't say anything more than that you're sorry. Here's the thing, you see her as beautiful, you didn't care about her hair falling out, but you know that she did. You watched that. You can shave and cut all day, it will start to come back immediately. She has to live with it without it coming back, maybe ever, while facing a lot of healing or the opposite in the coming months. She doesn't give a shit about your hair, you still have it, as far as she's concerned. She doesn't want to be mimicked out of pity, so there's that too, not that you intended that. If she comes out of this fine, and with hair, years from now, it will be a memory she'll flip you shit about. Don't expect her to care that you're NTA, she's NTA either, she's going through fucking chemo.", "NTA", "NAH. You're both young and it's hard to deal with emotional maturity when your hormones still haven't settled. It's even worse when you're going through cancer treatment. However, having cancer doesn't mean no one around you gets to not have emotions. You did the best you could and I wish her well in treatment.", "It sounds like maybe you had a little moment of seeing some of the same feeling she has faced over her hair, and it was upsetting.  Try putting it that way - you got a small taste of how she has probably felt about losing her hair, and it was hard.  It was only a small taste, but it was still strange and upsetting and a little scary.  You get to have some feelings over that.  Yes, it\u2019s not the big things she\u2019s facing, but the reason that what you did is supportive is because it is choosing to take a bite of the bitter meal she\u2019s forced to endure - doing something that does change what you look like and how the world sees you.  You chose to do that to stand with her, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t affect you.  If it didn\u2019t affect you, it wouldn\u2019t have much meaning.\n\nHaving said that, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s TA either.  I don\u2019t think she really understands that even if what you\u2019ve chosen to do is a much smaller portion of what she\u2019s been forced to do, they are related.  And I suspect she doesn\u2019t understand because her struggle and the losses forced on her are so big and loud and hard right now that it\u2019s hard for her to see or hear anyone else struggling. NAH.", "Your gf sounds like quite TA and if she pushes you to the point you leave she has no one to blame but herself", "NTA. Nothing gives her the right to dismiss and belittle your feelings. Not even cancer.\n\nAnd the whole \u201ccut your hair for me\u201d is bullshit. It\u2019s one thing if you do it out of solidarity. But she basically wants you to suffer the same way she is, but also suppress your suffering so that all the attention is on her.\n\nYou\u2019re both 17, so a lack of emotional intelligence is understandable. But if she doesn\u2019t apologize after calming down, I\u2019d rethink the relationship. You can do better than someone who will drag you down with them.", "I don't see how shaving heads does anything to support cancer. I'm not trying to be horrible,  but i seriously dont see how.  Donations to research. A massage. Or cleaning or washing or cooking for those able to be home. Some gardening, shopping. Pet care . A ridiculous girlie or guy fun time.", "[deleted]", "wat chemotherapy?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Both of you go through a lot rn. It's okay to feel whatever you also feel. I'm sure that it was probably chemo effects making her have that outburst and I hope you keep being loving and patient w her.", "NAH\n\nYou were caught off guard with emotions.and that is perfectly fine during such a time for all parties involved. Thank you for being such a supportive person and going through with shaving to support your girlfriend. It's very kind of you to make the decision to do this.", "NAH (it would be N T A except she has cancer so is dealing with a lot). \n\nMost of therapy in late life comes down to \u201cspent too long pushing emotions out of the way rather than letting yourself experience them & figure out a way to deal rather than hiding\u201d - so it\u2019s really, really important that you do not learn the lesson here that \u201csometimes it\u2019s wrong to feel the thing that you are feeling\u201d. \n\nYour girlfriend is just entirely & absolutely wrong about that part. \n\nBut the \u201cnext bit\u201d is where you can both learn a bit & potentially get closer over it. \n\nI would say that the fact that you had this unexpected emotional reaction is actually *awesome* in terms of offering her support with what she is going through. \n\nThat\u2019s actually amazing - because if you hadn\u2019t shaved your head alongside her, you wouldn\u2019t have known that that kind of unexpected emotional reaction was a thing. But having experienced it, it can make you more sympathetic to what she is going through, and better able to support her. \n\nAnd the second angle is that you can also both talk about how her reaction shows that she is probably feeling overwhelmed with dealing with her own stuff, and has no \u201cresources\u201d left for dealing with other people\u2019s problems. \n\nWhich is understandable for a period of time & with good reason - it\u2019s part of the \u201cfor better or worse\u201d commitment in a relationship - sometimes things are not equal, because of what you are going through. \n\nI know that when I\u2019m struggling with life I find it much harder to support my partner with his struggles.\n\nAnd you are both young, and she is going through a LOT - so it will be hard for her to find that level of maturity to allow you to have some \u201cneeds\u201d on occasion. \n\nBut for things to stay healthy between you, she needs to at least acknowledge that you have a right to your emotions / reactions, even if she cannot personally provide you support with them. \n\nAnd you need to make sure you have a support system in place. Google \u201ccaregiver burn out\u201d and how to avoid it. \n\nGood luck. This will be hard. But done well (with support) you will both be better off for the things you learn along the way.", "NAH.\n\nIf anything, you being upset about losing your hair makes you more understanding of how hard it is for her.  Going through something like hair loss *does* hurt, which is why you shaving your head to support her is meaningful in the first place.  Try to explain to her that while you're not in her exact situation, feeling upset about your experience makes you much more empathetic of her and what she's going through.  It's not about beauty--for a lot of people their hair is very much tied to their identity and autonomy.  She is going through a lot right now, so it is understandable that seeing someone else cry about hair loss triggered a lot of negative emotions.  Talking with her again when you're both calmer and explaining how much she means to you, and how much your gesture of support reflects that will hopefully clear the air and bring you two closer together.  I wish you both the best.", "Exactly, NAH .", "This says it all.", "I\u2019unno, I was one of those kids who was blonde and turned brunette, and I put it off with tons of highlights and bleach for the longest time. There were times right after I let it go brown / cut off residual highlights and the mirror just\u2026 didn\u2019t look like me. I wouldn\u2019t say shock, but some level of upset, yeah. Things Are Not Correct. It\u2019s hard to explain but I understand OP feeling off. And it isn\u2019t like OP was placing blame, he was just processing a feeling."]}
