I have always been sympathetic towards them ! I have always kept their wellbeing on my mind. So when my mother called me today to say it\u2019s another negative, I told her its okay if they want to try again they can or else there are other options too like surrogacy or adoption! Its entirely their choice. Now my mother knows I am a childfree by choice person. Mostly because of my mental health. I am married and even my husband is one too. So then she goes on by saying that \u201cIts just sad that neither of my kids have any children.\u201d I knew she is not agreeing to my lifestyle but I have learnt to ignore her comments usually. However i said my SIL had PCOS so sometimes it does take time to conceive but it will happen ! Don\u2019t worry! To which my mother started yelling \u201cYou only cursed them to not have any kids I know that\u2019s why they are failing every time. Your mouth is evil. Why are you saying that sometimes it takes time to conceive?\u201d Now this was not the first time that she has put this weird blame on me. The past two failed attempts had similar reaction from her. Tbh i didn\u2019t even knew this time that they were going through it again but somehow she ended up calling me and blaming me. So I felt it\u2019s high time I should stop her from doing this so I told her \u201cThey are doing sex they have decided to have kids how am I involved in this ? Why would you constantly blame me for their issues ? I am not your dustbin! Go instead ask your God why it\u2019s not happening? Or may be consult another doctor?\u201d And then I disconnected my phone. Now I feel if she goes on to tell all these in front of my SIL she will definitely feel its true cos since my own mother believes this stupidity.

There\u2019s no way you could be responsible. Perhaps she feels you should volunteer to be a surrogate, but that\u2019s too much to ask, especially as you have chosen not to have your own children. She probably really wants grandchildren, but you don\u2019t owe her that. Sometimes people look for someone or something to blame, but she\u2019s totally out of order in blaming you. Unfortunately, I worry that she\u2019ll also be blaming SIL too, so maybe discuss this discreetly with your brother. If she\u2019s calling you up to blame you, she might do the same to your SIL, and the stress of that will not help her conceive.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your mother has issues of her own, what with her wanting grandchildren and blaming you for being child-free and also for blaming you for your brother and SIL's trouble conceiving. \n\nI don't blame you for reacting either, it can be tough to just listen to that bullshit and not react when it's not your fault.", "NTA\n\nI see nothing wrong with your action.  Honestly, your mother is sick individual.  How can you be held responsible for something you have nothing to do with it?\n\nIf your SIL and brother believe your mother's BS, it might be better to go NC because they believe you to be evil which is bunch of crap.", "Sounds like your mom is in one of those \u201cpositive confession\u201d religious groups. Could be Buddhist based, could be Christian based. Doesn\u2019t really matter. The teaching is very strong in those communities that everything which comes out of your mouth affects what happens in real time. So if somebody has a cold, they can\u2019t say I\u2019m sick because that would actual cause the cold and make it real. \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating, for sure dealing with people who believe this. What you can do is have a calm conversation in which you point out that this kind of belief puts your mom, you, or others in the place of God.  Which is not logical. While you appreciate her frustration over no grandkids your words simply aren\u2019t that powerful. Cause if they were you could conjure up millions by just saying the words. And we all know that doesn\u2019t happen.", "NTA\n\nWow your mother is off the rails. I'd take a hard pass on interaction with her if only to avoid repeated irrational discussions (fits that defy reason). You were right to speak to what she was saying since presumably you were engaged in a conversation. The next time she calls, maybe just ask her upfront if she's calling for conversation with you or calling to speak at you.", "NTA\n\nBut i would have maybe told her \"you better watch your mouth or i will curse you too\", lol.", "Wtf did I just read ??", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t cause anything . \n\nYour mother just wants grandkids", "NTA. Why do so many of these religious types believe in a God that is infinitely wise about everything except understanding hyperbolic speech and emotional release? Why trust a God if you have to spend the rest of your life being paranoid about everything you think and say for it? Wouldn't a loving understanding God that knew absolutely everything automatically know what you meant and when you were just speaking out of frustration with the situation?", "NTA - just because you are child free my choice doesnt mean you \u2018affect\u2019 people who want kids and are struggling to conceive", "NTA. I'm in a similar family situation and i'm in my last fertil ages. I decide not have childs long time ago. My mother want grandkids and she never blame directly to me but i know she has some kind of feelings against me like someone \"owns\" her grandchilds, my brother try but i don't ever try so she feel at least i could try for her.\nPerhaps your mother has this feeling and she just find a way (stupid) to blame you.", ">\u201cYou only cursed them to not have any kids I know that\u2019s why they are failing every time. Your mouth is evil.\n\nWhat is this?  Curses and evil? This is not the Middle Ages. NTA", "NTA \n\nAs an infertile person myself... no action by others can cause or cure my infertility. Well, small exception for the actions my doctors and other specialists perform, but, you know. Someone else having or not having kids has zero impact on my situation. Removal of the uterus, vasectomy, birth control, whatever. Feel free. It is not going to hurt or help any infertile couple.", "NTA she is being totally unreasonable and quite an AH.
