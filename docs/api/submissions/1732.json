My child likes to reach out and touch his feet to the chair in front so we were relieved that we didn't have to spend the entire flight fighting his legs off the seat in front.

We were just hoping to get him to sleep so everyone could get some rest. The woman started looking back huffing every time her seat was nudged even before take off. Right after take off she fully reclined putting the seat back into the lap of my kid and looks like she's trying to sleep. After more looks and comments about controlling my kid I asked her if she'd be willing to move over to one of the other empty seats in the row where she could fully recline and I assured her she wouldn't be bothered. I explained how the airline dictated my kid had to be in the window seat due to his car seat otherwise I'd have moved him.

Anyway finally I had enough and told the flight attendant that the woman wasn't in her assigned seat and that the situation would be resolved if she had to move back to her assigned seat.   To diffuse the situation the flight attendant made her go back to her middle seat in the back of the plane, not only pissing her off but also the other two innocent people she was shoved between. I was at my witts end by the time it was all resolved because nothing I did was working to make it an amicable resolution.  In the end as she huffed her way passed us I quipped \"have fun in the back\". \n\nMy friend who doesn't have kids said I was an asshole by asking the flight attendant to put her back where she came from and for the comment at the end.

If that happens to be the case here, and the woman was noted as already getting huffy prior to takeoff, what else is the OP supposed to do? Plus, knowing there was a child sitting behind her who had already struggled with feet on the back of the chair, she still decided to recline the chair fully into the child\u2019s space.", "A six year old?

If it was an assigned seat, how were you going to handle it? You were lucky this flight, but what about the next?\n\nI get it, kids, hard to control, etc, and yeah, I think people who put their seats back more than 2 clicks are AH's. However, if the seat HAD been assigned, and the person had put it back, you had no good way of coping w/ situation. A situation you were well aware was more likely than not to happen. When it did happen, you ended up acting like you had more right to the empty set in-front of you than the woman who took the seat, but you actually didn't.", "I am saying the flight attendant should have offered to help with doing that instead of chastising the OP in front of the obnoxious woman in front.\n\nThe reason the OP sucks is because of the comment.", "[deleted]", "Instead of reclining her seat further into the baby, moving one seat up would have solved it.", "No but there's a pretty high probability of it.

She was in the wrong, doubled down, and it didn't pay off.", "No but there were several other options.  Even moving a seat over, picking another row.  This is not some woman trapped in a seat.  You sound like the person who loves into a neighborhood and demands the neighborhood change to accommodate you.", "You definitely take that risk! It's like saying \"I'm going to sit in front of the baby goat\" and then wondering why you're getting head butted. It would be one thing if the woman *didn't have a choice*, but in this case, there were options. *Choosing* to sit in front of a being that has very little to no social awareness or control means that you're taking on the risks of being disturbed.\n\nHeck, sounds like she could've moved one seat over to be in front of the parents and not have been disturbed at all. Why is it on the parents to completely mitigate a choice the other woman made?", "Well she didnt have a right to ask for the seat not to be kicked because well that wasnt her seat.. and then she decided to recline the seat all the way back to the childs lap?

Oh, that\u2019s too hard for her in your opinion right? YIKES", "Yes. One year old can't logic. They get bored they find something to entertain, often to the dismay of everyone. You can pack a kid a million toys and activities and they will still get bored and be annoying. Entitled parents exist but not every parent with an offending child is entitled just bc they don't have their child calm and quiet. Kids are annoying this is life and kids exist. All if you used to be an annoying kid. Trust me most parents are losing their mind trying to keep their kid from annoying you", "It wasn\u2019t her seat though, so what she wanted in this situation was completely irrelevant and it\u2019s why she was sent to the back of the plane. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers", "Thank you", "If it was her seat then absolutely I\u2019m gonna do EVERYTHING in my power as a parent to stop him from kicking. I don\u2019t know if people realize how hard it is to manage movements like that from a one year old. \n\nI would work that hard even it is wasn\u2019t their assigned seat but is also be kinda pissed that the passengers decision to move made my life so much harder. And she simple could have moved to a different seat in the row.\n\nI think as humans we all just need to work together to try and make the best of shitty situations like air travel. I have compassion for people with kids/people with disabilities etc. and will do what I can to make life easier for all of us.

They should not be asked to move.", "Um, moving. A family member dying. Having to travel for work. Do you think ppl with kids should just stay home until their kid understands traveling?", "One of the first times my son flew was for a funeral. Neither my husband nor I wanted to miss the funeral due to the the degree of closeness with the deceased, and we do not have anyone in our current city able to watch our children overnight (on the few occasions where it has been required, a relative has flown out to stay with the kids - but in this case that person was also attending the funeral, and they had a closer relationship with the deceased than we did). Our son did not attend the actual funeral as we arranged local babysitting in the funeral city, due to having a larger network there.", "Look man, OP took his kid on a flight and had no solution to his kid kicking the chair in front of him.

So did OP. You can only do so much with an infant/baby. Do you expect them to hold them prisoner with shackles on their legs. I\u2019m fucking sick and tired of childless people acting like they are soo much better. \n\nESH. Op shouldn\u2019t have made a shit comment. Passenger in question should be knowledge about kids not being prisoners and that kids fuck up all the time. \n\nAnd your comment just proves why people are starting to not want kids. One reason is that they don\u2019t want to raise kids in a world where their parenting is judged by non-parent adults and be shit on when kids have normal behavior. You act like kids are born knowing rules and social norms. You act like OP didn\u2019t make attempts to \u201ccontrol\u201d their kid. You also want to say that parents are entitled? Tell me how you expect a child to sit there quietly for 3 hours doing almost nothing so you can have your nap isn\u2019t entitled?", "Entitled parent? The child in question is literally a toddler! They\u2019re very new to the world and still learning. As much as you want to stop them, they tend to do as they please, on top of that, this story takes place on an airplane. You can\u2019t really enforce any consequences or distract them easily in that environment because there are limited resources. These people and OP aren\u2019t entitled. They\u2019re just parents doing their best to teach a child how to behave in public.", "True but the dude with a 1 year old in a forward facing car seat doesn\u2019t seem too into \u201cbest practice\u201d.", "I\u2019m not arguing about that verdict.

But that makes you an AH,  because nobody has to live with getting their seat kicked. \n\nLucky for OP that the situation resolved without him having to do anything, but OP had no guarantees that his kid wouldn't be kicking someone who paid to sit in front of him, and OP had no solution for that happening... and then acted like a smug prick when his lack of preparation didn't end up coming back on him.", "Hahaha indeed!", "Woman sees seat being kicked for last hour, sits in seat being kicked, is surprised and upset seat is being kicked.
