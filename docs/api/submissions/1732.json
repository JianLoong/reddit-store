My child likes to reach out and touch his feet to the chair in front so we were relieved that we didn't have to spend the entire flight fighting his legs off the seat in front.

The doors close and a woman from the back of the plane decided to come up and take the window seat in front of my kid. \n\nThen starts the hour plus struggle of fighting legs off of the seat, intermixed with him being upset we were trying to pin his legs down.  We were just hoping to get him to sleep so everyone could get some rest. The woman started looking back huffing every time her seat was nudged even before take off. Right after take off she fully reclined putting the seat back into the lap of my kid and looks like she's trying to sleep. After more looks and comments about controlling my kid I asked her if she'd be willing to move over to one of the other empty seats in the row where she could fully recline and I assured her she wouldn't be bothered. I explained how the airline dictated my kid had to be in the window seat due to his car seat otherwise I'd have moved him.

Anyway finally I had enough and told the flight attendant that the woman wasn't in her assigned seat and that the situation would be resolved if she had to move back to her assigned seat.   To diffuse the situation the flight attendant made her go back to her middle seat in the back of the plane, not only pissing her off but also the other two innocent people she was shoved between. I was at my witts end by the time it was all resolved because nothing I did was working to make it an amicable resolution.  In the end as she huffed her way passed us I quipped \"have fun in the back\". \n\nMy friend who doesn't have kids said I was an asshole by asking the flight attendant to put her back where she came from and for the comment at the end.

OP claims there were other rows ahead that had unoccupied seats, but evidently she wanted a whole row to herself and the only one she could find was directly in front of a baby and his parents. She was entitled, remarkably braindead in figuring out a way to solve the problem she'd created and OP was well within their rights to offer a comment when she was directed back to her seat.

This woman probably wanted a first class upgrade. She thought if she had a reason (like a kid kicking her) and was obnoxious enough about it she\u2019d be upgraded. If she just wanted a seat other than her assigned one she would have either sat in a different spot from the get go or relocated to one once she realized that the child was going to be an issue. But instead of doing that she did the one thing that everybody with two brain cells to rub together knows would probably escalate a child\u2019s behaviour by moving her seat even closer to the child\u2019s legs. That\u2019s also why she didn\u2019t bring up it not being her OG seat when she called the attendant. \n\nBecause she wanted that upgrade. \n\nSucks to sucks", "Seriously.

I would never sit infront of a child. Baby, toddler or teenager", "Exactly. All the hypotheticals are just that--hypotheticals. OP is asking about this specific situation. In this specific situation, this lady was insisting on a totally unnecessary choice when there were other perfectly good options available, and she had an attitude about it. OP is NTA", "This! Had this women sat in front of me and then reclined I'd be pissed as well. Leave the 1 year old out of the scenario and this woman was still an AH.", "You forget that this sub hates babies and kids.

If my kid was kicking someone's seat I'd either get them to stop or move myself.

Sure wtf you gonna do about that if the parent is doing all they can to soothe the child show some grace.  Kicking chairs or being obnoxious?  Yeah- not cool.", "I'd go with ESH because this all could have been handled better.\n\nI don't have kids and mostly dislike them, but if I'm making a decision to sit in an unassisted seat in a plane, then it's my own choosing to put myself in that situation.

It can definitely help at least a bit with the child being able to communicate simple wants/needs, like something to drink, eat, play, etc (this is a bit off topic, but it is helpful for people with kiddos that can't yet speak.

There will still be yelling and everything of course (because they are still incredibly young), but it does make things easier)", "And frankly Reddit hates kids sooo", "Yes, you're supposed to keep your kids rear facing as long as possible.

I bought tickets just recently for thanksgiving travel and it's absolutely true certain seats cost more.", "Even if he had paid for a whole extra seat, that wouldn\u2019t have solved the issue of the woman choosing the empty seat right in front of his child and then getting mad about it.

The carseat didn\u2019t fit well or at all rear-facing because the airplane seats are really close together and carseats are huge; and\n2.

Mothers are struggling with toddlers anyway. What were they supposed to do? Throw their child off the plane???? Some kids are more energized than others. I once was on a flight where the kid decided it wanted to sit on my lap. Not the mothers. The flight attendants had to get him strapped to me when we took off, and he refused to go to anyone else.
