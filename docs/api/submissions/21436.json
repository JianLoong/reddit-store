It is a public space and you asked nicely. The best way to bring a jerk to his knees is to tell him he looks upset. Adding that he looked like he was going to cry is a nice touch.", "NTA. The first response was condescending. The second unprompted response was asking if you were offended. He was purposefully looking to get into an argument and got his panties in a wad when you didn\u2019t engage the way he wanted.", "NTA since you asked nicely. \n\nThis is a touchy subject.

Noise is a biproduct of common spaces, especially those deemed recreational.\n\nAgain, nothing wrong w/ asking but nothing wrong w/ playing, either.

Where I come from, people who blast music, making everybody around them listen to it as well, are considered assholes. They might have the legal right to do it, but the people around them are also legally entitled to think of them as assholes.

There are all kinds of ways to be an asshole that are perfectly legal.", "It depends where you are at, but a public pool is one of those places where it is common (same with beach, park, etc).  It's not on a train.", "Well, quite recently in my country, a law was issued to curtail this very issue on a beach setting. There are now fines for those who \"use sound equipment or other noise generating activities that cause disturbances\" to other beachgoers.", "There are noise ordinances here. It is nothing that a bluetooth speaker would amount to, though.  There are decibel amounts, and it's typically professional speakers and stuff of that nature, that BLARES music, not simply plays music (even if on full volume).  It varies by location, as well.  If this was yesterday in the US, and kids were running and people playing music (as they most certainly were), no one would say anything about the noise.\n\nI'm just saying - OP's desires are out of sync with reality.  She went to a COMMUNITY POOL.  It's a RECREATION AREA.  People play music.  Wanting peace and silence is not something one should reasonably expect.\n\nI am a property manager - I have to tell tenants this shit all the time. The neighbor is acting lawfully and reasonably, and at a reasonable hour.  I've never seen a Bluetooth that can produce the type of sound that would be excessive.

I LOVE it. Apparently men like this refuse to acknowledge that anger is an emotion. The author used the phrase, \u201cyou\u2019re having some big emotions right now\u201d and suggested they needed some time to calm down. Act like a baby, get treated like a baby.

I was on the bus last week, and the guy behind me was listening to Kanye at top volume on his phone, which means we were all listening to Kanye.
