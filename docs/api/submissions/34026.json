My siblings were less than impressed with the location and had said they would never live in such a city, but good for us. Fast forward a year, the siblings that had originally judged the location moved in under the pretense that they needed a place to stay until they could get back on their feet. They also brought their families, so space was very cramped. Initially they could not pay into the mortgage, but after a few months we got into a groove and they started to contribute to \u201cthe rent.\u201d My husband and I paid for the bills and about 50%-70% of the mortgage, and I saved their rent money to help in their eventual move. Fast forward another two years and my SO and I moved for work. We ended up purchasing a second home and left the first for my family to use until they got on their feet. This unfortunately meant they had to pay the full mortgage amount plus their bills as well. We refinanced to lower the payment and make it more manageable, but they have never paid the full amount and I ended up paying the remainder. Over the next two and a half years my credit cards have maxed out and my credit has taken a significant hit from making up the difference. I\u2019ll also note that after buying the second home I quit my job to care for my LO. This was intentional. I\u2019ve always been calculated with big life decisions, which is why I opted to have children later in life once I had secured an alternative form of income other than working. My intention was to use our first house as a rental property, though for obvious reasons this didn\u2019t work out as planned. Well now we need to move again and we\u2019ve decided to sell our first home as it has the most equity. Unfortunately, my siblings and their families are faced with the incredibly difficult task of finding a home at the price point they were renting my home for, and now I think they\u2019re all upset with me (and maybe rightfully so). I\u2019ve offered assistance but have yet to hear from them. Their silence has always been an issue as well because too many times have simple fixes around the house ballooned into more complex and expensive issues due to their lack of communication. I feel very bad for putting them in this position, but we simply can\u2019t afford to house them any longer. They have no disabilities that stop them from getting jobs, they simply don\u2019t have the skills, motivation or education to get high paying jobs. They also have a preference for living in more expensive locations than what they can reasonably afford, and they\u2019ve made terrible financial decisions in the last few years (think buying a new car, then trading it in a couple of years later for another newer car, maintaining an expensive habit, etc). I\u2019m also reluctant to allow them to stay in my second home, as that mortgage is higher than the one they already weren\u2019t affording.

They have limited income due to poor financial planning, and will most likely need to move much further away to afford anything within their price range. Some may end up homeless due to a lack in motivation in finding a place to stay.

Not your problem.", "Can you pay my bills as well? i might want a house too. I mean, you're letting your family take advantage of you, so who's one more person to drag throught, right?  \n\n\nSeriously? You have a family to take care of , your own future to secure, and you drag these lazy people with you, pay their way and freeload off of you.  \nGirl, really. come on.  \n\n\nSend them a text or whatever telling them that you're over it. That their behaviour is disrespectful of everything you've done for them despite them shitting on the house when you bought it first and that it reeks of entitlement that they think YOU need to continue to provide for their lazy asses. Remind them how much time they have to find new accomodation.  \nAlso be prepared to sue them if they destroy the house in the process of moving out.", "NTA - They were not renting, they were freeloading by not paying you the full amount or market rate.  They were totally abusing your generosity and expected it to continue forever.  Unfortunately, their bad habits will cost you $$$ in selling the home.  May not be able to show it due to clutter and them resisting.  May have to legally evict them, and have the house decluttered and cleared out - they certainly won't be able to move all of their stuff.\n\nOther option is to sell the home far below market rate and let the new owners do all the eviction, cleaning, rennovation, etc.  \n\nEither way, they have cost you $$$ in addition to what they didn't pay in rent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sell the house and never let them move in again.", "NTA They have you wrapped around their finger if you can't realize that. Why on earth would you be responsible for their poor choices? It was painful to read how you are bending over backwards to accommodate them.They have benefited from \nyour kindness for years, having them make their own way is looooong overdue.   Obviously they don't want that because they will have to take responsibility themselves but that is how life works.", "Nta.    \n\nYou can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink.   \n\nYou did everything you could to help and get them on their feet. But they just took advantage of you.  Now than 2 and a half years now. Time to cut them off.", "> and now I think they\u2019re all upset with me (and maybe rightfully so)\n\nIt is absolutely NOT right or justified that they\u2019re upset with you. They\u2019ve been freeloading off of you for years - the fact that they\u2019ve been blowing all their extra money instead of using this opportunity to save is their fault and not yours. \n\nYou have been incredibly generous - too generous to be honest. While it was a kind thing to do you\u2019ve also been financially irresponsible by getting into debt to help support their lifestyle. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA.

And now you have to deal with this. \n\nBefore you put it on the market, you need to do a proper *legal* eviction. Because you know they won\u2019t go quietly and will most likely try to hinder the sale if they are still there. They will put up a huge fuss, but it must be done. NOW!\n\nYou\u2019ll probably hear how you are abandoning them in their time of need, yadda, yadda, but you have to stay strong. And NOT offer them another place. Your \u201chelping\u201d them has only enabled them to do nothing and has hurt your finances. \n\nLegally *evict them now!* And don\u2019t do anything like that again.
