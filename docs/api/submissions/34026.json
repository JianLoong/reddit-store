There is no logical reason they\u2019ve freeloaded off you this long, which for the record is what they\u2019ve done. Maybe they did have a situation in the beginning but that\u2019s long since past, they became complacent because they knew sis would pick up the slack. They haven\u2019t found housing not because it\u2019s not available, but because why would they? When they have it made with you? & their taste is bigger than what their pocket can afford. The same likely goes for jobs, now I\u2019m not saying they can find great jobs but if any of them are unemployed or working part time there\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t find a full time job. If they lack education and skills they can easily go into manual labor and make a shit ton of money. In fact most trades will pay for your education because they\u2019re needed so badly, all while paying you great money. With how many people are living in that home there\u2019s zero excuse why between them all they can\u2019t rent a cheap home with even minimum wage jobs. \n\nTheir want for things they can\u2019t afford or their lack of motivation is not a good enough excuse for you to continue to fund their lives. It\u2019s also not your responsibility. They\u2019re not children and they\u2019re definitely not your children you don\u2019t owe them cheap rent or an easy life. Yes, family helps family but there\u2019s limits with that. I come from a family of 7 siblings, I\u2019d die for them. God knows I\u2019d do anything to help them, but there\u2019s a huge difference between helping and enabling/being taken advantage of. You letting them stay in the beginning? understandable, but that line ended months in. That\u2019s where it went from helping family to being taken advantage of. Not to mention the point where you left the home and let them stay; or how about when you reduced the payment even after that? babe, you have way over done what should ever have been expected of you. Your responsibility to \u201chelp family out\u201d ended long long ago. \n\nI\u2019m not saying never help in general but I\u2019m saying specifically with them and regarding housing/money. It\u2019s time for them to figure it out on their own, and it\u2019s time for you to grow the spine you need. I\u2019m willing to bet you grew up in an environment that guilted you into believing that this is what family does, or that it\u2019s your responsibility to pick up where they fall short; you don\u2019t. Helping also means helping them in the long term not the short. I.e helping them get a job, maybe helping with the down payment on an apartment, etc. You letting them freeload has only hurt them long term. Sidenote; I wouldn\u2019t take a word they say to heart, not a one. They have everything to gain by convincing you that you\u2019re in the wrong, because if done successfully their free ride continues. Do not believe a word or insult they say because it\u2019s all biased and loaded so you can do what they want. I also need to warn you if they\u2019re extremely resentful there\u2019s a chance you may have to legally evict them. \n\nEdit: It\u2019s best to do things by the book from the start. Send a mass message to all of them and/or send a letter via mail that has to be signed to be received stating they have until x date to leave. Make sure it\u2019s 2 months before you plan to have the house sold. That way if they\u2019re not out by then and you have to evict it won\u2019t affect your ability to have the house sold. Since there\u2019s a likelyhood the court may give them 30 more days; then once those 30 days are done the court will enforce them leaving on the 30th day with constables. You need to be logical and relational about this, and dont you dare let yourself feel guilty or be made to feel guilty for this.", "When has \"Just until we get on our feet\" ever meant anything but \"For as long as we can possibly milk this\"?", "Your comment hit the nail on the head. We\u2019re actually already in escrow, but had to list it for 40k below market. The tight finances we\u2019ve been working with have prevented us from doing any type of fixes, so the poor house has no working ac, a leaky roof, and many leaky faucets. They\u2019ve also painted the rooms odd colors (somewhat allowed as I wanted them to feel at home..at first), but one sibling outright drilled holes into his door with the screws sticking out toward the hallway. I blame his drug use for this, and of course myself for enabling this behavior. And the walls have drawing and crayon markings from a child they used to babysit. It hurts because my husband and I painted those walls during our new home montage (ha). So yes, the home is in dire need of repairs, which is why we have offered buyers credit and it is listed below market value. Fortunately the market in that area is a sellers market, so we received plenty of offers above asking. The appraisal is today, so we\u2019ll see just how bad our situation is. I calculated how much profit we\u2019ve missed out on since leaving, and I immediately regretted it.", "Agree 100% with this.  Get them out now and stop subsidizing them.

And I also get that some families are raised differently and put varying degrees of importance on family ties, so it\u2019s hard to understand why a person would sacrifice themselves \u201cneedlessly\u201d. I was unfortunately raised in an all for one setting, where one\u2019s success are a shared success. Things started fracturing when in-laws made their way into the family, though. It became an everyone for themselves situation.

But people rarely act as one thinks they will.", "My thing is that every story has multiple viewpoints. I\u2019m the villain because I enabled this behavior and now I\u2019m taking away their ability to simply survive in that area. And they most likely don\u2019t see it as freeloading since they\u2019ve been paying what we\u2019ve agreed upon (forget that I asked them what they could afford and they came back with a fraction of the cost of the house). And as adults, I didn\u2019t see it right to tell them what to do with their finances, I just assumed they knew to be saving for this eventuality. I had previously tried to get them out two other times, but both times they said they couldn\u2019t afford to leave. I recently found out that their alleged car payment is $600-$800 dollars (again, allegedly because the husband likes to exaggerate sometimes), and that kinda set me on this path I\u2019m on today. But I honestly have tried to get them out, or have at least kept that in the forefront of their thoughts.", "And I would\u2019ve kept the house and you would\u2019ve paid me alimony and child support. Hopefully you have better forethought in your life decisions. And well, thankfully my husband  and I see marriage as a permanent state and we are both honorable, so this would never happen. Unfortunately this means we need to work through stupid decisions we each might make. Then again, that\u2019s what makes a marriage. Additionally, if I hadn\u2019t carved out this life, he wouldn\u2019t have done anything to put us on this path. We wouldn\u2019t have what we do if I hadn\u2019t pushed his butt to make these financial moves. Not to say that it gives me a right to squander them, just saying that they exist because of me, but are also being stupidly squandered because of me. This means it also falls on me to remedy the situation, which is what I\u2019m working on now. It a complex situation that may seem easy to the third party not emotionally invested. Imagine your most trusted family members needing help and they make a 180 a few months into the help. That\u2019s what happened here.", "He hasn\u2019t, and I think he understands that he\u2019s a major contributing factor to their current predicament. The thing is, I don\u2019t think that household is capable of working together, or would even know how to live outside of family properties. Most of them have spent a large majority of their lives either living under my parents roof or under extended family\u2019s roofs, until finally landing under mine. And I honestly believe in my heart that they\u2019re not malicious about it either, they just simply don\u2019t know how to do it on their own. My plan is to help them get into their next place and hopefully they can start making more responsible moves after that.", "Thank you for the suggestion. My biggest issue with doing something like this is reluctance to put my nephews through something traumatic like an eviction, but also hurting their parents chances of finding a place by putting an eviction on their records. And more directly, we can\u2019t afford the fees associated with an eviction. I don\u2019t think they would fight me to leave, or at least I hope they wouldn\u2019t, but then again I had higher hopes for them when I let them stay there. Thank you again for the well wishes.", "This. Also, do not tell them you are keeping home #2 to rent or they will demand you let them move into that one and continue to leech off you.", "Unfortunately I\u2019m now at the mercy of the appraisal.

I also worry that they\u2019ll ask for money because they considered their stay as a favor to me for \u201ctaking care\u201d of the house. I\u2019m not sure what to do in situations where realities are skewed to this degree.", "Yes I realized I was enabling them, but I didn\u2019t know to what degree.

OP cost themselves tons of unnecessary money.", "NTA- and way to not lead with the the family spending money on drugs instead of the bills", "You're now in the position where you're enabling their freeloading ways.  You have child but instead of saving money for their (and your) future, you've gone into debt paying for your adult siblings and their families.  Of course they're not going to stop making bad financial decisions and of course they're never, ever going to move out on their own accord.  You will have to evict them and then they will blame you.  You've created this situation and now there's only one way to fix it and you need to do it immediately.", "This is the right take! My wife makes good money, however my role allows me to make even more.\n\nThe difference is that while I focused on my career when I was young, she focused on us, pushed me to get my certifications, pushed us into buying a house in what I thought was a bad market. Pushed us to have our first child at a reasonable age (while I maintained that we still were not ready).\n\nIf it were up to me, we\u2019d still be living in the same shithole just forgoing life for the pursuit of money.\n\nBut she opened my eyes to a lot more, she was always the one wanting to elevate us.

I can\u2019t expect her to only be kind to me.\n\nNTA - but eventually you need to stand firm with a No. they are taking advantage of you, hopefully your husband is also noticing and helping to nudge you into the hard but correct decision of eviction.

You are, however, doing the right thing by selling the house.  I married into a family much like yours - my wife is wonderful and functional but the rest have squandered every advantage they had.  We are a team and have done well.  In our case, I gave her relatives chances she said I shouldn't have - and she was right.  Good luck.  I can tell you from decades of experience that \"helping\" often turns to enabling.", "Stop helping (enabling) them. You\u2019re just kicking the can. Get them out of your house and focus on your own children. Enough is enough!", "Didn\u2019t you say that you had saved their rent money to help in their eventual move? You could take the legal fees from there.

You helped when you could, now you need to take care of yourself. Stop letting them mooch, and stop subsidizing their lifestyle. Evict and sell. Your relationship with them will be damaged, but you need to prioritize yourself because no one else will.", "Their stay was not a favour, it was a burden. \n\nYou said yourself, they paid less than market rate, which you would have gotten if not renting to them. You wouldn't have had to make up the difference if they had paid market rate, you wouldn't have maxed your own credit cards and stuff to support them. \n\nThey were a burden, not a favour. \n\nAlso, you really do need to stop saying they contributed to the mortgage or references like that, if they fight things and you're quoted as saying it someone may interpret it as there being a verbal agreement in place. With you buying a 2nd home elsewhere it may be viewed as rent to buy, where they paid part price to own equity and they'd have part ownership. \n\nBe super careful when you say or write anything. Make sure they can't use it against you. They paid rent, while renting, as tenants. \n\nThey've have reduced rate for what, 4 years? More? And they haven't \"gotten on their feet\". How long are you supposed to support them? \n\n6 months, 9 months, a year? 2 years, 4 more years? Would it ever end. \n\nThey moved multiple people in with them, and you're saying multiple families and people can't make a full mortgage payment which is less than market rate rent??? How would these people ever live at all? \n\nPay a friend with a clipboard to show up, \"value\" the house, slap a sign up. 2 weeks later start having your friends turn up to view the place as prospective buyers. Tell your family they need to be out, the house is sold on \"X date\", turn up to hand the guy with a clipboard the keys and say you've signed contracts. \n\nDo not under any circumstances say you'll pay for a moving truck or storage temporarily for their stuff.

Change the locks!!", "The magic word in that situation would be a firm no.", "You are going to need any gains you get out of the home sale to pay off your bills that THEY caused you to accumulate.

Started using my credit after that was depleted.", "I have an issue with thinking of their behavior as mooching, even though it might be clear as day for third parties. I see it as ignorantly surviving bc they were never taught to be responsible. Granted I had to learn that on my own, I think I had better tools to learn these life skills and I might just be setting myself on fire because I know they couldn\u2019t withstand getting cold. Their decisions, although stupid, were a result of ignorance, and through no fault of their own, my nephews were born into that. I suppose the guilt of making better decisions for myself led to my taking limited responsibility of their lives.

We already pulled the trigger and have an actual appraiser coming in bc the house is in escrow now. And I feel responsible because I have the means to help, and I\u2019ve always been taught to help if you have the means.

This is your fallback plan, you don't have a second fallback to keep helping them forever.", "Yeah, hence why we\u2019re now in the middle of selling the house. I saw that my nephews were on the same path as their parents, so now it\u2019s time for them to learn the harsh realities of living to survive, and hopefully one day thrive.
