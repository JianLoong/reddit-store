Of course Logan was not jumping for joy at this request and he was hurt, angry and told Madelyn he wasn't going to be their family ever. Madelyn went to court to try and get rights to Logan back but dropped the case before it reached its conclusion. The judge had ordered therapy for Logan and once Madelyn heard the therapist say it would be a very long battle if Logan were to ever consider Madelyn and Rob any kind of family, let alone parents, she gave up and stopped the fight to get custody back.\n\nA few years later Madelyn and Rob had \"Jace\" (18m) and \"Sophie\" (17f) together. \n\nFor more than a year Jace and Sophie have lived with me because their parents did not give them the happiest home life lately.

My husband found them snooping through our phones. We had another talk and they refused to stop. I told them they need to stop because they cannot keep living with me if they don't.

And you need to stand your ground on this one. These kids aren\u2019t going to learn anything if you cave on this.\n\nYou are a saint. Don\u2019t become a martyr. They will be relentless, because they don\u2019t seem like they\u2019ve been held accountable, ever. Their needs and wants do NOT trump Logan\u2019s.

Your home is a safe space, and you won't use it to house people who actively ignore your loved ones boundaries. \n\nExplain that whatever happened with them and their mum, Logan was left behind so their mum could have fun and they are proof of that.\nHe has done a lot of healing but things like that run deep and whole you hope one day he will be able, and want to meet them, you won't risk your relationship by letting them force it.", "Finally a sane comment lol.
