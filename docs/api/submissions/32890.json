Of course Logan was not jumping for joy at this request and he was hurt, angry and told Madelyn he wasn't going to be their family ever. Madelyn went to court to try and get rights to Logan back but dropped the case before it reached its conclusion. The judge had ordered therapy for Logan and once Madelyn heard the therapist say it would be a very long battle if Logan were to ever consider Madelyn and Rob any kind of family, let alone parents, she gave up and stopped the fight to get custody back.\n\nA few years later Madelyn and Rob had \"Jace\" (18m) and \"Sophie\" (17f) together. \n\nFor more than a year Jace and Sophie have lived with me because their parents did not give them the happiest home life lately.

I respected his decision and never tried to convince him.\n\nFrom the time they came to live with me I insisted Jace and Sophie seek therapy because they had been through a lot.

He showed me screenshots of the messages and Jace and Sophie have been demanding he see them. Two days ago Jace and Sophie tried to get mine and my husband's phones to get to Logan. My husband found them snooping through our phones. We had another talk and they refused to stop. I told them they need to stop because they cannot keep living with me if they don't. I said Sophie could stay until she's 18 because I would not make her homeless. But I won't tolerate them harassing Logan and pushing his boundaries like they have.

Those two kiddos have some serious lack of respect for boundaries. I guess it\u2019s from their relationship with their folks. They are harassing Logan, invading your, your husbands, and Logan\u2019s privacy!!! And they refuse to stop. \n\nI know this going to sound harsh, but I actually think you should consider enforcing the \u201cyou can\u2019t live with me anymore if you continue\u201d boundary. The fact is that Logan is your son. For all intents and purposes. These two are not. You are their aunt. Yes, you are putting Logan first, unlike everyone else in his life. And you need to stand your ground on this one. These kids aren\u2019t going to learn anything if you cave on this.\n\nYou are a saint. Don\u2019t become a martyr. They will be relentless, because they don\u2019t seem like they\u2019ve been held accountable, ever. Their needs and wants do NOT trump Logan\u2019s. And if they are held accountable and still continue, then that sounds pathological, and nothing you do will help. Either they will help themselves or they won\u2019t. But Logan needs you in his corner on this one. \n\nYou love these kids, too.  That\u2019s clear. But love sometimes has to be firm and hard, when necessary.", "NTA but what do they mean that they should be your priority? Why?", "First of all, you are lovely for taking in and raising your sisters abandoned children.\n\nJayce and Sophie should leave Logan the hell alone. So what if they are interested in and want to meet Logan. Logan doesn\u2019t want to have anything to do with *them*.\n\nLook, I might be interested in Taylor Swift. I might have some damn kind of little obsession and feel a connection want/need/feel *entitled*, even,  to meet her. But ya know what? Calling her and harassing her is one step from stalking, and you can get arrested for that. Or at least face some legal action and get put on a list. \n\nNTA, Logan for wanting and you for enforcing some boundaries.", "*They told me it wasn't fair and I was putting Logan before them when they should be my priority.*\n\nYou're not and it's very weird for them to frame it this way. Can you do a session with their therapist where y'all focus on this? NTA but woof this is a hard one.", "Btw put passwords on your phones.", "NTA at all.  You've given them multiple opportunities to knock it off.  Forcing them out was your last option.  Don't leave your phones lying around anymore.", "NTA. Logan is your son. You raised him and he chose you. You absolutely should prioritize him! Your niece and nephew need to respect the boundaries Logan and you have set. You are a much more tolerant person than me. If I had caught them snooping through my phone for his contact info after being repeatedly asked not to contact Logan, I would have already been making alternate living arrangements for them. You're a wonderful person, OP. Don't question your efforts to protect your son.", "Nta and what a great parent you are to Logan", "NTA but what exactly do they think they will gain here? Logan doesn't want anything to do with them. They will only get hurt when he ends up shutting them down completely because he's going to get very tired of being harassed and stalked. He would have every right to snap and be extremely rude as is needed. Take away their phones and internet access.", "What the hell is wrong with your sister?  She seems to be the root of all the issues that are now on your shoulders because she has kids she doesn\u2019t parent. I have a lot of respect for you and your husband for stepping up with all her children but these girls need to back off. I know you\u2019re doing your best. Absolutely NTA. It\u2019s a sad situation all around.", "NAH. Logan doesn\u2019t want a reminder of his shitty bio mum. His half siblings want to work out what happened to them and why and Logan (they think) has those answers. None of these kids are assholes. They were failed by a caregiver. OP, you are an awesome human but please don\u2019t add to these kids trauma. Don\u2019t threaten them. They\u2019ve had enough of that from their mum and dad. Ring their therapist again, make it clear what is happening and ask for a family session where you and they can talk with their therapist present and mediating.", "NTA - Why should they be the priority? Like yes, you are helping them that doesn't mean you let them do whatever they want. I would sit down and ask them why they seem to keep trying to reach out to him. What do they think it will accomplish? They have a brother and a sister and it's the two of  them. They are old enough to realize that he wasn't around when they were growing up and therefore he doesn't consider them family. That all they are doing is pushing him further away by trying to contact when he doesn't want contact. In fact, I would go so as far to tell them that they need to understand that their mother selfishly abandoned him so that she could go \"live her life\" and end up having them, and because of that Logan doesn't care for any of them. They are old enough to hear all of this.", "NTA.

That said, I\u2019m confused, how would they know about you and not know about Logan?? Did you continue to raise him? If so didn\u2019t they see him when they saw you??

I would reiterate firmly that they can't \"force\" someone to talk to them, and that they are guilty of harassment and stalking, and both old enough to be prosecuted.

I can't imagine the effort they are going through to contact a lost brother for no reason. I think their therapist needs to get to the bottom of this because there seems to be a deeper reason.

But their mother pretty much screwed them there. It's unfair and it's not right but it's their reality and they have to accept that. \n\nThey are going to mentally poison themselves if they keep dwelling on the people who refuse to have them in their life.", "They likely grew up hearing how Logan \u201crefused\u201d to be part of their family; and now he\u2019s an adult and they\u2019re teens so they figure they come first \n\nIllogical", "The post says only that they haven't met Logan, not that they didn't know about him. I guess they're asking a lot of questions about him now because they have the opportunity to do so, now they're with OP full time.", ">*And why does Logan refuse?*\n\nI imagine it's because he doesn't want anything to do with the siblings his mother chose to keep and raise after essentially abandoning him because she thought he would get in the way of her dating/sex life.\n\nI know his siblings didn't have anything to do with that, and it's not their fault, but I can understand why he wouldn't want a relationship with them.", "They say because he is their brother and they should all know each other and be close.

If maybe they chill out and learn the family dynamics, they may one day get to meet their ***cousin*** but you\u2019re not holding out hope given their current actions. \n\nAnd, of course, follow through with kicking the eldest out if they won\u2019t stop. I understand the wariness of kicking out the minor for now.", "Aha; no worries!"]}
