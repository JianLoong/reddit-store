We couldn't go a day without us arguing, and it felt like I needed to walk on eggshells every day otherwise she would start yelling and cursing. She has Asperger's, depression, and anxiety, and she's gotten treatment for the depression and anxiety and is now doing much better, but keep in mind that it wasn't always like this. She never had issues like sneaking out or drugs, which I am grateful for, but she wasn't easy to handle at all.\n\nAnother thing to add, there was a time when she took a 20 dollar bill from off my desk, and gave it back after I asked where it was, saying that she didn't want to keep it and wanted to \"see if I would notice\".\n\nAnyway, onto the main issue. While I was working in my office, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, and I look and see it is my daughter. I see that she is looking around (like making sure no one is seeing her), ruffles around in her mother's purse, closes the purse, then jogs back to her room, and she was smiling the whole time.\n\nI will admit, I felt very angry then, it basically took me back to when I was fighting with her all the time and having to deal with her, and I was thinking \"Now she is stealing from us.\" The reason why I thought this is because why else would she make sure no one is watching her and then go through her purse? I was basically seeing red, because I don't care if it was a cent or 100 dollars, she stole from her mother.\n\nI got angry and I went into her room, and I started to yell asking why the hell she would do this to her own mom and that she should be ashamed for it, and she begins to cry, and I thought she was playing dumb so I got angrier, until my wife came in and asked what was going on, and I explained it to her. My daughter was trying to speak but she was crying too hard, and so my wife left the room for about half a minute, and came back, with a very confused look, holding her purse, and a little origami paper swan. \n\nAt this point I was confused too, but my daughter finally calmed down and said \"I made a paper swan and put it in there because I thought it would be funny and cute, and you would notice it when you got ready for work next morning\". I was dumbfounded for a few seconds, and I said to my wife \"are you sure she didn't take anything?\" (not in accusing way, more like in confusion way), and my wife said no, there was nothing missing from her purse at all.\n\nAfter that we all stood in silence for a minute, and my daughter said \"can both of you leave for now? I need some time alone.\" and we did leave her room.\n\nNow my daughter hasn't been talking to us (me or her mother) since last night, and I do feel bad, and my wife says I should apologize. But what can one assume when you see a difficult person going through at bag? I was wrong, but it looked very bad.

You owe her a serious and heartfelt apology.\n\nI would also encourage family therapy. It\u2019s obvious there are some leftover wounds from the hard times you\u2019ve had. Still, *you\u2019re* stuck in your daughter\u2019s past\u2026 and that\u2019s not fair to her.\n\nEDIT: Also, Asperger\u2019s is an outdated term that is no longer endorsed universally by healthcare professionals, at least not in the US. Autism is the recommended term.\n\nEDIT: I mentioned this in a comment, but I will add it here as well. My original edit was for educational purposes.

The fact that you jumped immediately to stealing was a huge red flag; I immediately thought that she'd put something IN the purse, like a note or a present. (Thieves generally don't *grin ear to ear*, they want to look nonchalant. Present-givers do.)\n\nThe fact that you didn't talk to your wife first and verify that something was missing, and didn't *ask* the daughter but just jumped straight to loud accusations is horrible. You need to get therapy and anger management counseling *right now* before you lose it and hurt someone again.", "YTA. Essentially you are equating past struggles with mental health issues as gateway to stealing.\n\nI wonder why your daughter struggled with all this.\n\nMaybe you were not the most loving patent.", "YTA.  Even your throwaway name \"AITAstealingmoney\" - no money was stolen here.  You're still blaming your daughter for your mistake.  You made a big mistake, but it's her fault you made it.  No.  You made a mistake, own you made the mistake.  And apologize.    \n\n\nYou mention a lot of problems between you and your daughter.  Is this the type of example you set in the past?  Not owning up to and apologizing for mistakes?  Flying off the handle based on assumptions, without getting all the facts first?  Were those the lessons you imparted as a parent?", "YTA. You owe your daughter a very big apology. Your ASSumptions made a very big asshole out of you and extremely alienated your daughter. Kids grow up. Kids change. You could\u2019ve simply walked into her room and asked what she was doing in her mothers purse. If something didn\u2019t lineup you could ask your wife off-line.\n\nInstead you raged all over your daughter damaging an already complicated relationship.\n\nAgain, you owe your daughter a very big apology.", "Yes, YTA.

That\u2019s normal, and judging from the way you treated her here, I\u2019m suspecting you didn\u2019t \u2018walk on eggshells\u2019 nearly as much as you claim to.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you ask her what she was doing? Why immediately jump to the conclusion that she was stealing from her mother when she\u2019s never done anything that bad? Why start screaming at her without waiting to hear her side? If she did steal, she wouldn\u2019t be able to lie about it \u2014 her mother knew what was in her purse. You need to apologize.", "YTA straight up, you said that she's gotten better and the fact that you assumed the worst of her? That says a lot, you immediately went with \"why else would she be looking around to make sure no one was around?\" And you decided to completely ignore the fact that she went to her room all smiling and happy. You didn't even think of talking to her before you started yelling at her and went straight to yelling?

Immediately just started yelling at her without having a conversation.", "Yes YTA \n\nYou flew off the handle immediately and screamed at her until she cried.\n\nThere were other ways to approach the situation and honestly you just seem bitter and resentful because she\u2019s been a \u201cdifficult person\u201d. Maybe don\u2019t be so quick to see the worst in her.", "YTA 1000 times over. Get your facts straight before you make any accusations. Also, since you mentioned the $20, it is not really what you think. You noticed the $20 missing, asked her about it, she returned it.

Whether it looked bad or not you were wrong, and need to apologize.", "YTA Majorly.\n\nSo you went straight to the extreme and immediately assumed she was stealing. The first thing that came to mind was theft...\n\nYou owe your daughter a major apology because what you did was wrong.

Man I feel so sorry for your daughter to have parents who goes 0-100 on assumptions. Seek help OP", "YTA, extremely much.    \n\n\n>why else would she make sure no one is watching her and then go through her purse? \n\nJust because YOUR first thought was theft doesn't mean that was the only possible explanation .\n\nEven if you think she stole, a calm \"I saw you with your mother's purse, can I ask what you were doing? would work better than going nuclear on her, regardless of what your daughter did, but especially in this case.", "YTA. Apologize. Profusely. Your behavior in this scenario was absolutely wrong and unacceptable and the fact that you didn't immediately apologize and actually came her to ask if you should is absolutely mind boggling. Yes, you were wrong at every step of this and you need to take accountability for that. Not only did your daughter not do anything wrong, but she was trying to do something sweet, and you immediately assumed the worst of her. Not only do you need to apologize, but you need to do some work on acknowledging who your daughter is as a person and not assuming that because she was mouthy to you as a child that she's a bad person.", "YTA my god whoever said mental health issues and the like were a gateway to stealing? You had so many different ways of dealing with this and giving the benefit of the doubt. Be better next time you think of people who struggle", "YTA.  You made a judgment mistake and you should apologize.  Imo it\u2019s important to acknowledge our errors with our children.  We all make mistakes.  You could have handled this better.  While it is understandable she has lost trust due to her past actions, you could have asked her what she was doing in her mothers purse calmly.  She likely would have told you about the origami swan, no harm no foul, and your wife would have had a nice surprise.", "YTA. And a brutally awful parent. That poor kid.", "YTA. Jumping right to yelling and accusing her is bad enough, but then  \n  \n> my wife says I should apologize.  \n  \nYou haven't apologized??  You made a wrong assumption and hurt your daughter. APOLOGIZE TO HER.", "YTA as soon as you said \"smartmouth.\"", "YTA You immediately jumped to the worst conclusion and then went in guns blazing and never let your daughter explain.

Shame on you.", "YTA.  Not to pile it on,  but behavior like this causes depression in your kids. You need to reevaluate the way you deal with your daughter and her mental health will probably improve", "YTA but I think you already know that.\n\nI understand the panic witnessing that would\u2019ve caused you, and how that influenced your reaction. When you don\u2019t know all the facts, it can be best to take some time to calm down before you approach the person. Remember, at the end of the day she\u2019s your daughter, not an enemy.\n\nIt\u2019s much harder to find the truth when you go in expecting the worst, and stay on the attack. Misunderstandings like this are less likely to happen if you let them tell their story first, and then discuss the inconsistencies together, if there are any. \n\nYou definitely should apologize and do something nice for her, maybe make some paper swans in return, or something else that would be meaningful to her.", "You must have some very strong leg muscles from all that jumping to conclusions.

Why are you, as a 50 year old adult, coming into this subreddit asking if you should *apologize*? \n\nLet's review what happened:\n\nYou already see your daughter as a theif because when she was younger, a TEEN struggling with *untreated* disorders, she was \"hard to handle\". But this is besides the point, honestly.\n\nYou see her doing something you thought was stealing, so you go and yell at her like mad, not asking her what she did, not even giving her a chance to speak. Turns out you were wrong.\n\n\nSo why shouldn't you apologize? Is that not what people do in these situations? What if the roles were reversed? Would you not expect an apology? It's two fcking words. Gosh this sub gets me so angry sometimes because of the mental gymnastics people go through to avoid saying \"I'm sorry\". You are so prideful. No shame. I don't care what your shtty reasons were for accusing her, you were wrong and you were extra wrong for handling it how you did. You apologize like the big boy you are.\n\n\nEdit: and nice to know that because of your daughters history battling a mental battle you failed to treat, she's still a \"difficult person\". Hope she gets out soon as she can", "YTA - She's difficult, but you're not making it any easier.

And you owe your daughter a swift apology.\n\nThere's nothing I hate more than when my boss at work hears one side of a story, sits me down, and says I was wrong, without hearing from me, when I was actually right.

Your mistake was not conducting an investigation, not even asking a simple question of, \"What are you doing?\" Even an accusation of \"I saw you do X.\" Instead it was straight to opinionated judgment: \"she stole from her mother\" and the yelling about why she would do that.\n\nZero to sixty in an instant is not cool, even, and I would say especially, when you have a poor relationship with a child.", "YTA. You ask what was happening to clarify, not run in screaming and acting insane.", "YTA if she had a history of stealing I would understand.

He was the one starting 90% of all arguments, and he always said I was being a smartmouth when I was simply trying to defend myself from his accusations and outbursts.

We couldn't go a day without us arguing, and it felt like I needed to walk on eggshells every day otherwise she would start yelling and cursing. She has Asperger's, depression, and anxiety, and she's gotten treatment for the depression and anxiety and is now doing much better, but keep in mind that it wasn't always like this. She never had issues like sneaking out or drugs, which I am grateful for, but she wasn't easy to handle at all.\n\nAnother thing to add, there was a time when she took a 20 dollar bill from off my desk, and gave it back after I asked where it was, saying that she didn't want to keep it and wanted to \"see if I would notice\".\n\nAnyway, onto the main issue. While I was working in my office, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, and I look and see it is my daughter. I see that she is looking around (like making sure no one is seeing her), ruffles around in her mother's purse, closes the purse, then jogs back to her room, and she was smiling the whole time.\n\nI will admit, I felt very angry then, it basically took me back to when I was fighting with her all the time and having to deal with her, and I was thinking \"Now she is stealing from us.\" The reason why I thought this is because why else would she make sure no one is watching her and then go through her purse? I was basically seeing red, because I don't care if it was a cent or 100 dollars, she stole from her mother.\n\nI got angry and I went into her room, and I started to yell asking why the hell she would do this to her own mom and that she should be ashamed for it, and she begins to cry, and I thought she was playing dumb so I got angrier, until my wife came in and asked what was going on, and I explained it to her. My daughter was trying to speak but she was crying too hard, and so my wife left the room for about half a minute, and came back, with a very confused look, holding her purse, and a little origami paper swan. \n\nAt this point I was confused too, but my daughter finally calmed down and said \"I made a paper swan and put it in there because I thought it would be funny and cute, and you would notice it when you got ready for work next morning\".

Let me try to explain: When I was a child, I set up \"tests\" for my environment to see how they react. I wrote with my left hand in class to see if my teacher would allow it or stop me. I made jokes about others, trying to imitate friendly teasing, and learned which jokes are okay and which ones are hurtful. Sounds rude and dumb, and in hindsight, it was, but as a child I was not socially skilled enough to see what \"tests\" were socially accepted. It was also not done out of malicious or careless reasons. Think of it as a scientific experiment. Most people have their intuition to know what outcomes a social interaction will have. Autistic people don't. They often do \"science experiments\" instead, to learn how people react to the situations they create. The motivation is curiosity and also a more secure understanding of how the world works. \n\nGiving your daughter the benefit of the doubt now: When your daughter took your 20$, she tried to see how you would react.

The face where I am sitting here silently trying not to cry because you just yelled at me and I know if I leave you\u2019ll accuse me of avoiding the conversation, and I know if I start to cry you\u2019ll accuse me of being dramatic/manipulative, but apparently I\u2019m being manipulative anyway because I\u2019m *giving you that face*? \n\nWhich would usually end with me yelling at her, because if you assign a kid a role in a dynamic where everything they do is wrong and there is no choice that won\u2019t be assumed to have wicked motivations, your kid\u2019s probably going to go \u201cfuck it. You won\u2019t deescalate this, and I don\u2019t know how to deescalate this, so I\u2019m just going to vent my emotions.\u201d \n\nSometimes, in relationships like these, parents will fall into the pattern of assuming the worst, and if you do that to someone enough, *especially* a child who is still *learning* who they are and is being told over and over through your treatment of them that they\u2019re \u201cdifficult\u201d, you don\u2019t leave them with any way to prove you *wrong.*\n\nThe way OP not only immediately assumed the worst, but didn\u2019t even take the time to verify or ask her for the truth before coming into her space and *screaming at her* makes me think that this pattern of thinking about his child is a *habit*. \n\nHe owes her a big apology, and he owes it to her to try and change that habit moving forwards and let her show him who she *actually* is.", "My ex is like this to our son, who is also neurodivergent. His attitude towards our son has lead to so much damage to our son that will take years to heal from, causing his depression and anxiety to be so much worse. And all my son wants is for his dad to love him and be proud of him. I make sure his dad has a little contact with him as possible, and visits are supervised. I've never understood how his dad can be so resistant to even trying to understand our son. \n\nOP, YTA, for judging your daughter so harshly with no proof, for being so angry at her that you screamed at her until she was in tears and non- verbal, and for refusing to apologize for the harm you have caused. What you did is verbal and emotional abuse, and you should be ashamed of yourself.", "Do they now just lump everyone under the Autism Spectrum?", "Mentioning that Asperger\u2019s is no longer a stand-alone medical diagnosis (in the US at least) and that there *are* individuals who are offended by saying they have Asperger\u2019s is not the same as saying not to use it at all.\n\nFor the final time, they are just trying to make people aware that the medical term has changed but it should be handled on an individual basis.", "He\u2019s not a jerk, he\u2019s a nazi sympathiser. If you did some research you\u2019d know. He encouraged the killing people he considered the \u201cuseless,\u201d autistics. Like someone with what\u2019s now known as level 3. Sure, the same can be said about other diagnostic names; do you have a particular example of this? Genuinely curious. \n\nThing is, Asperger\u2019s IS autism, the symptoms are the same. Literally no differences, except for the lack of language delay is Asperger\u2019s. I get better support cause where I live, therapy\u2019s aren\u2019t only for kids (Australia) and my diagnosis of level 2 says to people, I need more help. When I move out, I can get a weekly carer. I won\u2019t go into further detail about my medical information though. \n\nHow does the term help? It wouldn\u2019t help any more or less than just saying \u201cautism,\u201d you still have to go into detail on how you\u2019re affected and accomodations you need, which are illegal to deny btw. People are actually less likely to help someone saying they have Asperger\u2019s, as it has always been portrayed as barely being a disability. \n\nPeople treat you differently because of ableism, we can fight against that, really. People who have higher needs are treated worse than level 1 (formerly Asperger\u2019s) they do not have different symptoms, if you do an bit of research, you\u2019d see extreme if not full overlap. The more terms there are, the harder it is to diagnose something specific, leading to more misdiagnosis, double or triple diagnosis etc. You seem to be struggling with change and that\u2019s okay, but it doesn\u2019t justify the lack of awareness you display on autism. You are autistic, you can say you have Asperger\u2019s if you want to, but people won\u2019t stop correcting you, and it won\u2019t suddenly become recognised as a diagnosis again. Some countries do still use it, some aren\u2019t even meant to but do (my sil was diagnosed Asperger\u2019s after they put it in the same diagnosis as autism.)\n\nAnyway, Asperger\u2019s has always been seen as autism anyway, so why do you have such a problem with it being part of the autism diagnosis? Outside of it, it enforces the idea of Asperger\u2019s syndrome people having more intelligence, and even the idea of a linear spectrum which isn\u2019t possible.\n\nYou just don\u2019t like the idea of being lumped in with autistic people, that\u2019s internalised ableism. Work on it. \n\nAnyway, have a good day.", "Asperger\u2019s has always been known as a form of autism, it\u2019s not lumping in, it\u2019s acknowledging that they\u2019re the same. Asperger\u2019s and autism have the same symptoms. I was diagnosed in 2006 with Asperger\u2019s, has the same symptoms as a friend diagnosed with autism. My diagnosis has since been re-evaluated as level 2 autism", "Correcting people on their usage is erasure. If they say I or my child have Asperger\u2019s you shouldn\u2019t \u201cum actually them\u201d. If they wanted it to be called asd they would have said I have autism spectrum disorder. They said what it was and it should have been left alone.", "It\u2019s a spectrum and it states where I am on it. They could come up with a better term but shouldn\u2019t erase it all together. To me it\u2019s like saying all cancers are cancers so don\u2019t say what type you have. Even though different types affect you differently. Technically it\u2019s all cancer but saying what type narrows it down.", "OP also screamed at his daughter and still wants to paint her as the bad guy in the situation, so I\u2019m not sure he has her best interest in mind on this subject. He seems to be using her diagnosis as justification for his own anger and mistrust towards her. \n\nBut if you think otherwise then by all means.", "All the term \u201cAsperger\u2019s,\u201d does is state that you wouldn\u2019t have been killed in a genocide. It is JUST autism, level one support needs. You are so stuck in an ableist mindset that you can\u2019t acknowledge the harm some terms do. Names change ALL the time. It\u2019s not M\u00fcnchausen syndrome anymore, it\u2019s factitious disorder.\n\nLet\u2019s not use cancer as a comparison, all cancer is cancer. All of it is awful and needs treatment, no matter the type. Correct? Yes. Yes, different types need different treatments, but most use radiation too.\n\nThe only difference in the symptoms of Asperger\u2019s and autism, was that Asperger\u2019s don\u2019t have speech delay. That\u2019s it, all the rest is the same. \n\nYou\u2019ve been able to call yourself autistic and say autism in reference to what you do desperately want to call Asperger\u2019s, it\u2019s evident you know they\u2019re the same thing. Why so hung up on a word that did people harm? \n\nDo you not like being grouped in with more severely disabled people or what? Cause I\u2019ll say now, it doesn\u2019t tell anyone what symptoms affect you, at all. If you want to distinguish it, you\u2019re most likely level one support needs."]}
