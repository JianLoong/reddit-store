You don't need anyone's permission to talk to anyone, plain and simple.\n\nYou're NTA, and it's your choice whom you talk to and whom you share the information with (your mother sounds paranoid, though).", "NTA\n\nYou're a full grown adult and you can make your own choices. I'll be honest, at 70 your sis isn't getting any younger so it's best to make a move sooner rather than later. If you want to know her, go for it", "NTA - Your mom is way off base on this. What is a talking to a 70 year old woman about a dead man going to do.\nYour mom was a sugar baby, that fact cannot change now, she needs to get over it.", "NTA. It sounds like your mom has a guilty conscious about something. You should talk to your half-sister. She's the only family on your father's side and she's 70 year old. You may never get another chance if you wait to talk to her. Once she passes away there won't be anybody else to answer your questions about your family history.", "NTA. Whether your mom likes it or not, that is your family and if you are both agreeable then you are both adults and have the right to get to know one another. If your mother didn\u2019t want you asking questions one day, she shouldn\u2019t have been having an affair with a married man old enough to be her grandfather.", "NTA.  Wanting to know about your relatives is a perfectly normal impulse.  Your mom\u2019s acting on insecurity and assumptions, and it sounds like she really has no grounds to believe your half sister will be nasty other than that.  With your dad long passed, and the divorce happening over 25 years ago, there\u2019s been enough time for any rancor to have dissipated.  Sure, it\u2019s possible that it hasn\u2019t, but if your half sister turns out to be nasty about it\u2026you can just stop talking to her.", "NTA But be prepared, there is likely a good reason your mother is and always has been so against you meeting your half-sister.

It sounds like there was a lot going on when you were conceived that may be hard to explain if it reflected badly on their choices. You're an adult and can make your own choices. If your mom is asking you to respect her wishes above your own interests, do it anyway! You have a new sister, how exciting! Don't let their insecurities, shame, embarrassment of what you may find out about them stop you. That's entirely unfair of them as you have no reason to carry on something that neither your sister or you had any part in creating. Time for them to either change their minds or mind their business!", "NTA.  You're an adult and can do as you see fit but I suspect that there is a lot of information about your father, and possibly your mother, that your mother does not want you to know.  Don't talk to your half-sister if you're not prepared to hear things that will be less than flattering to your parents.", "NTA\n\nYour 25 not 5. Live your life the way you see fit", "NTA. \n\nYou're 25 years old. Do what you want. Your mother doesn't get to decide for you.\n\nIt's just speculation, but I would guess that your mother is reacting out of shame -- she was the homewrecker 25 years ago, and she's probably worried that her husband's original family will think very poorly of her.\n\nThat may or may not be true, but it has nothing at all to do with your desire to connect with your remaining family.", "NTA. Or YWNBTA.\n\nYour mom denied you the opportunity to connect with people who could teach you and tell you stories about your dad, whom you lost when you were young. \n\nYour mom also had a hand in robbing your half-sister a chance to be on good terms with her father in the years before he died. \n\nShe may have treated you wonderfully growing up, but it can also be true that she did a very bad thing with lifelong consequences and is now doubling down on that bad decision. That's not acceptable, and no amount of past good motherly deeds can cancel this out. \n\nConnect with your sister. Learn about your dad. Let her feel some connection to her father through you. And if your mom wants to act like a child, it's ok to take a break from her for a while; it may give her perspective on the consequences of her actions.", "NTA\n\nListen, you're 25. You're an adult, you can make your own decisions. You can make good ones and bad ones. So can your mom. Whether talking to your half sister is a good idea or no, none of you know. You don't know what she's like. It's possible that she's a nasty old lady. It's possible that she's the sweetest person you'll ever meet. It's possible that she's angry and bitter about how your dad's marriage went after he met your mom. You just don't know.\n\nWhat you do know is that you can decide for yourself if you like what she says, if you want to continue contact, and what you'll do from there. Your mom and others sound paranoid that your half-sister knows some big, dark secret about her or has something else big she might tell you. Or they don't trust you to think for yourself. Neither of these seem good reasons to NOT reach out.\n\nIf you wanna talk to her, then by all means, reach out. It's not an asshole move to try to make SOME connection to a bit of the family you've never met.

Yup and that will be because she chooses to be mad about something that doesn't have anything to do with her. \n\nAnd I'm just going to say it because it doesn't come up in the op directly - your mom may have been the other woman giving the timing and your half sister likely given that she was an adult made her feelings towards your mom clear to your father.", "NTA.

Even if she is older than your grandparents, she is a biological relative.  Don't worry about what your mom and her family think.

However in the process I have found a complete other family my grandfather had. If my mother was a live she would be appalled and try the same thing yours is doing. The point is this is your sister. You can hear about your dad and have something more the just memories of a young child. You have a chance you were denied growing up. You can chose what YOU want to do.
