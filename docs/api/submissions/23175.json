You may have to explain that this has to do with Melody being your niece.  That means you're occasionally going to want to spend time with her yourself, and that's the way you're doing it.  No offense to Leah, but she's not your niece.  It's too bad if she doesn't have an equivalent relationship with people in her actual family, but that's one of the hard parts of being in a blended family.

Do you not consider her family?\n\nIs Melody uniquely skilled to babysit? Do your children have particular obstacles or issues for which Melody is suited to deal with, but Leah is not?", "It's good answer but question remains why you trust one a lot more than other to be a babysitter when both are raised by your oldest brother.

There are plenty of other ways that OP can make sure Leah feels included in the family, but they do not have to cater to Leah's Mom in this instance.", "It sounds like you\u2019re actually going out if your way to not engage with Leah here. \n\nEspecially considering that you spend all the extra time with Melody (rides to and from, ice cream after, etc), I feel like this issue is more about how you feel about treating Leah like a part of your family than it is about her babysitting.

My siblings at a young age are the ones that made me feel included. They included me with their cousins, friends etc when I was new to the family. My \u201cstep\u201d dad also made sure I was involved in all family activities. I was niece, granddaughter, etc not \u201cstep\u201d this and that.

But \u201cwe change our dates to avoid using Leah if Melody cant babysit\u201d is a different story. \n\nIf they really don\u2019t know her or feel comfortable, there are really easy ways to work that trust up (e.g., hiring a sitter while you work on a really big project in the house that takes attention, ask Leah to co-babysit and get used to their kids, invite Leah and family over to specifically get to know her better) they go out 3-4 times per week so it would seem money and time are not hugely important. \n\nAs it is though and from the comments OP is leaving theyre making a pretty conscious and outward choice not to ingratiate Leah into their world in any way, and it also sounds like its coming across about as hurtful as it could. \n\nDef some conjecture on that last part, but the whole situation as OP explains (and doesn\u2019t) is a super weird red flag \ud83d\udea9", "He commented what he doesn\u2019t give this job to a neighbour kid as well.\nSil needs to keep stuff equal for girls, both should be able to get some money.

You have the right to say no, but people have a right to have bad feelings about it.", "So is \"fuck off\" the next time he wants to do family stuff with the people he offended. You can do whatever you want but if your goal is to not be an AH and take others into consideration, there's that.", "A complete answer doesn't mean it's not AH behaviour. While OP has every right to never ask Leah, that doesn't mean that it's not still going to cause tensions and divisions, and there's an innocent kid, who is part of the family, whether or not OP likes it, who's going to be getting deliberately excluded.\n\nIf Leah has been proven to be unreliable, that would be one thing, but other this is a definite YTA to me.\n\nI think too often, people on here over conflate what people have the right to do with actually decent behaviour.", "The kids might prefer ice cream for breakfast, too, so in and of itself without context, no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sufficient reason.", "The question is not whether or not he has to give a reason.
