No offense to Leah, but she's not your niece.  It's too bad if she doesn't have an equivalent relationship with people in her actual family, but that's one of the hard parts of being in a blended family.

Why is someone a favourite? Is it because they are blood? Because someone naturally likes the person who is blood related to their family? That is literally the point that's being contested. Maybe Melody is a favourite for legit reasons, being around 24/7 or offering to help or just being more kind in general. So between your opinion and mine, they're both subjective and we can't come to a conclusion in good faith as our foundational belief has differences. \n\nYour staunch stance though is that Leah can't take Melody's job. My staunch stance is that for lack of context, if there is no discernible difference in trust or disposition of the girls, the job unfairly went to Melody in the beginning. Should Leah have bad been offered first or declined first or said no, or scoffed at the job that's also different and it would be unfair for Melody to give him her job but as it stands the original post has zero context as to why Leah is untrustworthy. Favouritism seems to be a clear factor and it's highly likely that the favouritism is linked to blood, and without reason that's actually crappy.\n\nI personally, with the lack of context that OP is providing, believe I am making the most logical conclusion and will be willing to change with new info, but I don't believe blood means family and if there is nothing else differentiating the two girls other than blood I don't know what else to say. I am open and willing to hear why Leah is less trustworthy or if Melody just spent a ton more time with the family, that is all fair. I didn't see that in the post though.\n\nEdit -trying to comb through to make sure I say Melody bc autocorrect is a thing and an inexcusable blunder.", "Perhaps OP wouldn\u2019t have said \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d if SIL didn\u2019t keep pushing the subject.

If Melody isn\u2019t available, they don\u2019t use Leah, they cancel or change their plans. \n\nSo while thats still their right, for all the options to get to know Leah, let their kids know them, and actually figure out if she would work as a family sitter, it does seem they\u2019re just hiding behind excuses as a means of excluding her. \n\nAnd thats AH behavior.", "This is 100% how id handle it. My kids arent babysitting for you anymore til you can start to treat my step child like part of our family. No sibling of mine is going to make one of my kids feel like they arent part of the family.", "This sub gets weird about step kids, so any suggestion of \u201cunfair\u201d treatment toward a step kid gets lots of people riled up. \n\nBecause the SIL is forcing the issue and OP is resisting (most likely in large part because she\u2019s forcing the issue so hard), the people in here get flipped around and go \u201cWhy are you pushing back against this? Since they\u2019re a step kid who isn\u2019t getting the same exact opportunity as their stepsister, this is unfair and you hate step kids and you\u2019re bad.\u201d\n\nIn short, a lot of projection from young people who very likely don\u2019t have kids. I wish there was a verified AITA Over 30 sub", "Because she's being heavily overplayed to watch tv and do her homework while her cousins behave themselves. Dudes language makes it obvious that he knows he is the AH, so he overplays the minor parts that make him look like he's NTA and underplays the major parts that reveal how much of an AH he is", "Seriously. Trust needs to be there before you can watch my kid, not after.", "That's my point though - nobody has even asked Leah what her feelings are. Maybe she doesn't want to, and asking her that would solve the problem wouldn't it? If she does then it's a simple matter of explaining that's not how jobs work and you don't just get to take over someone else's job for them because you want it. Obviously Leah's mother is an AH for making this this an issue in the first place, but If Leah is interested in babysitting for money she can baby sit someone else's kids. But I digress. I just think op or SOMEONE in the situation can just speak to Leah and ask what she thinks instead of deciding that for her or just assuming she's not reliable.", "Not only that this is going to cause a lot of conflict between BOTH of op\u2019s brother\u2019s daughters.", "Also these people seem to also be glossing over the fact that the mom wants this job for *her* kid because the pay and  \u201cperks\u201d.", "There is reference to the fact that pushy SIL said that she wanted Leah to have the perks of Melody's job and hence did not want to look elsewhere. It's not about loving the kids, it's about ice cream and rides back and forth so SIL does not have to put any effort into Leah's job."]}
