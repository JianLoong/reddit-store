Who could want to do this?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m going to guess the husband has a few people he could name, but OP is definitely one of them.

If you set fifty dollars on your desk, in full view of a coworker and they take it. You've just outed your coworker as a thief, you didn't entrap them, the thief was inside them all along. Obviously, the only reason this guy wasn't messaging other girls is because he didn't have girls lining up to ask him for pics, the temptation would have come along sooner or later. Better his wife know now what kind of person he is in the face of temptation.", "Different contractor, different unfaithful husband.", "Still waiting on an explanation.", "By definition, it has to be done by a government or law official. Civilians can\u2019t entrap another civilian. Also, it\u2019s only considered entrapment if the person was forced to do something they wouldn\u2019t have normally done. Sounds like this dude was already cheating, but OP ensured he would have the screenshot to prove it."]}
