It\u2019s a 8k project and he didn\u2019t pay anything down but he would continuously try to annoy the shit out of me. When we first did the contract he agreed to the price and then tried telling me some pity excuse for the price and how he wanted the work done for 4k(said oh it\u2019s a priority for me to get this job done but my vacation is also expensive, like why would this be a priority then for you?) \n\nWe just wrapped it up and he still won\u2019t pay and keeps trying to threaten bad reviews and spreading the word that I cheated him. The app that he had reached out to me on had shown his involvement in singles groups. I joined that group and screenshotted everything, and had a few of my friends text him from fake numbers pretending to be girls from that social media group and get him to send pics and texts that would incriminate him. \n\nCompiled it all into a big letter to his wife explaining what I had seen on his social media activity and send printouts of the screenshots. Dropped it off when I knew he would be at work in the mailbox. \n\nHis sister is a sweetheart and she has me on a big project for her home, and I went today to check on the work there and she was talking to her husband about a divorce that was filed against her brother from his wife.", "created_utc": 1685840429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zvwx7/aita_for_exposing_my_customer_as_a_cheater_to_his/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't be putting things in mailboxes, but either everybody sucks here or nobody does, and personally, I'm just here for the drama.", "ESH\n\nNo doubt that he was an AH throughout your dealings with him.  You mentioned contract...if he signed it, he has no recourse for wanting to pay less at a later date. \n\nAs a person, he's an AH for cheating on his wife.\n\nBut when he doesn't pay and is threatening bad karma, you didn't go through normal channels (at least not any that you describe), you go the nuclear option and set this AH up to showcase his cheating ways.\n\nI get it, you got your revenge, and in the end, you are helping the soon to be ex-wife get away from this AH, but it was an AH move any  way you look at it.", "NTA.\n\nNot your business but I'm of the belief that if you know someone is cheating on their significant other, you tell them. No sparing feelings. Most people would want to know their spouses true colors.", "ESH. Why on earth do you think interfering in his and his wife's relationship is an appropriate response to a business dispute? Regardless of his behaviour, you sound very unpleasant.", "Jeeeeez....\n\nI love it when petty people try to screw over petty people and get the arses handed to them. \n\nSounds like you did the wife a good service and she'll have all that proof for the lawyers.\n\nMake sure you chase him up for the payment after the divorce lol\n\nNTA", "He may be the asshole for trying to shortchange you and undermine your business. I think you\u2019ve punished the wrong person, his wife is now suffering, whilst she may be better off without a man that\u2019s apparently cheating or attempting to, that wasn\u2019t your place, she\u2019s ultimately been humiliated by finding out from a third party and your intentions were for your own appeasement not out of concern for her.

Why sink to his level? \n\nETA.", "He looks like an asshole for what you describe. although in this situation you have behaved quite horribly man, and I would argue that if he get divorced due to your letter to his wife  he could have grounds even to sue you. That\u2019s not way to make business.", "ESH. While I love a good revenge story, this just isn't right. There are so many avenues you could've gone down in order to get the payment you were owed (Contacting the app, small claims court, etc.) Has he paid you yet? If not, and I assume not because now he is dealing with a divorce, you only screwed yourself here.", "YTA because this does not get you paid.  You need to file a lien on the property and get paid.", "ETA\n\nHim for trying to cheat you and you for blowing up an entire family out of revenge. No one has the moral high ground here. But for sheer collateral damage done to innocent people, you're worse.", "ESH. \n\nHim for hassling you about the project and then refusing to pay. \n\nYou for entrapment and blowing up his family over this job.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
