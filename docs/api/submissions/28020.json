Got an A on an assignment? Sister got an A+ and a national award. Scored a goal in soccer? She got recruited to play on the varsity team as a freshman. Have a crush on a guy in high school? He worships her and follows her on Instagram and likes every photo. Only one teacher my entire life actually treated me like an individual. To everyone else, I was just \u201cX\u2019s Sister\u201d, and treated like dirt for not being her. Our parents can\u2019t get through a sentence without mentioning her and her accomplishments. It\u2019s like I\u2019m invisible, even though I\u2019ve done some cool things too (I have a moderate internet following and have spent a lot of time improving my guitar and songwriting skills). \n\nShe left our small town and went to an ivy league school, and that just made her legend around town even bigger and more annoying to deal with. While there, she met a guy from a super wealthy family and started spending all her holidays traveling with him instead of coming home. So I basically haven\u2019t seen her since she was 19 and I was 16. This has been genuinely good for me, it would have been better if everyone would stop talking about her all the time, but I\u2019ve been able to control my reactions and most people don\u2019t know that I have any problems with her. \n\nNow she\u2019s planning \u201cthe wedding of the century\u201d, literally a $60k blowout bash, and I\u2019m a bridesmaid (\u201cwear whatever you want! But it has to be a stupid shade of powder blue! And no patterns! And wear your hair in a ponytail!\u201d). But I don\u2019t want to go. I don\u2019t even want to be in the same room as her, much less attend her four day celebration/attention fest. She keeps asking me if I\u2019ll be able to make the bachelorette party, and our parents are putting pressure on me to book my flights for the wedding and bachelorette. They\u2019re devoting all their time this year to planning her wedding with her future in-laws, and I\u2019m left behind to take care of our pets. They don\u2019t even check in with me while leaving me home alone with high need animals, and I\u2019ve had to drop plans several times to petsit and take them to the vet. \n\nI just want to RSVP no and skip the wedding. My boyfriend is supportive, but thinks it would be a bit of an asshole move, because I have plenty of experience bottling up my feelings and getting through things like this, and she will only get married once.", "created_utc": 1696198384, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xen8h/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_21f_sisters_24f/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did you leave off a zero?", "YTA.  It doesn\u2019t sound like your sister actually did anything to you, just that you are jealous of her life and the attention other people have chosen to give her.  I can understand why it\u2019s been hard for you, but you\u2019re taking out your anger on the wrong person.", "Sounds like she hasn\u2019t actually done anything malicious to you and you sound incredibly jealous and bitter. You should seek therapy to work through what ever perceptions you have about how you\u2019re treated and how having her accomplishments celebrated makes you feel less because that\u2019s on you. She shouldn\u2019t have to dim her life to ensure you feel comfortable. Also yea don\u2019t go you\u2019ll probably try to make it about yourself and how her wedding and those attending are (rightfully) giving her all of the attention on her big day.", "None of this is what I would call golden child behavior, how exactly does she fit that title?", "You need to be honest and rsvp no now. I think you\u2019re being incredibly immature over the dress color. Most bridesmaids have less input in what they\u2019re wearing. If your hatred of your sister can\u2019t be put aside for one day, it\u2019s best you don\u2019t attend.", "Decline the invitation to be a bridesmaid and to attend the bachelorette party, just say you can't afford it and can't take that much time away from your job and/or studies, which is undoubtedly true.  Don't bring up the favoritism now, because your parents and sister will absolutely refuse to hear it.   The thing is, your sister may not really want you to be a bridesmaid or bachelorette, that could well be your mother's idea.\n\nAs for the wedding, if you refuse to go in advance, there will be no end of family drama, so you'll either have to insist that you're the only person in the world who understands the needs of the pets, or plan to spring a last-minute emergency on the family.", "Try  to share in other people\u2019s successes.   If you cannot, skip the wedding. If you see your family and friends as competitors, you will have a miserable life.  Self esteem comes from within.", "YTA. You're not dripping jealousy, you're drowning in it.", "You will send a message by not going and I'm sure you will find support on reddit. But, are you willing to give up your family. Personally I would, but everyone is different.\nBTW $60 thousand is differently not a blow out bash, especially for super wealthy people.", "If this bothers you, don't go. But I'll suggest therapy for you. Your parents really screwed up though.", "YTA she hasn\u2019t actually done anything to you. She\u2019s just living her life and your are jealous.", "Wtf. Should she have dumbed herself down so you felt better about yourself? You sound like you have a lot of resentment and therapy might be good for you.", "YTA. You are being jealous. I don\u2019t know if a powder blue dress goes with green envy.", "YTA, and I\u2019m also the black sheep under the shadow of the golden child. Your sister didn\u2019t do anything to you, and it\u2019s not her fault that your parents favored her.", "YTA. \n\nYou sound like a typical, whiny younger sibling who just needs to get over themselves.

She hasn't mistreated you, I'm pretty sure because it sounds like you hate her and you'd be sure to list mistreatment.\n\nSo you're just bitter and jealous.

Jealousy is a bitch!", "I\u2019m surprised at the negativity of some of the comments stating the OP is TA and bashing her for being jealous.   When one is NOT the GC, of course jealousy plays a role.  Who wouldn\u2019t be jealous when no matter what one does, it is never good enough?  And to say, \u201cjust get over it\u201d?   Sure. That\u2019s easy.  With a snap of the fingers all emotions will go away.  \n\nOP\u2019s feelings are valid for where she is in life.  She very well may need therapy later in life.  So what?  NTA, but OP you need to think about this decision.  This could be a make or break with your family.", "ESH all the way around.\n\nI get it, you are not the favorite, but you are holding on to this so much and your sister lives rent free in your brain at all times.  It's time to go low contact with all of them, move out on your own, and leave these people behind.  Also, you absolutely need therapy to let go of all of this.\n\nAs for the wedding, it's still early and you can decline being a bridesmaid by citing work or school or whatever as your excuse.  It's just not a commitment that you can make at this time.  You will absolutely hear about this so be prepared.  Honestly, if you can swing it, I'd move out now.", "YTA just go, smile and wave\u2026. Things may look different in 10 years and you may actually get on with your sister when you\u2019ve both had a chance to grow up. If you don\u2019t go, she\u2019ll remember it forever and that\u2019ll be it for relationship", "1. 60k + super wealthy family doesn\u2019t equal \u201cblowout bash\u201d lol that\u2019s just a regular wedding. \n\n2. An invitation is not a summons, don\u2019t go if you don\u2019t want to go. \n\n3. Your sister didn\u2019t do anything to you, other people did. So you being jealous and mad at her for what other people did is stupid.", "I'm finding it hard to believe this is real. You didn't speak for 5 years, but she wants you in her bridal party? What did you say when she asked you to be a bridesmaid? If you agreed to it, YTA for waiting this long to back out.\n\nSecondly, $60,000 is an absolutely reasonable amount for a wedding, not a \"blowout,\" but there's no way that'd be enough for a 4 day extravaganza. YTA for judging before you get your facts straight. \n\nAnd lastly, if this is true, it sucks to be in a siblings' shadow, but you're a grown ass adult now. Everything you described has nothing to do with you and is in no way stopping you from living your life. She's allowed to live the way she wants without you being condescending about her wedding colors or whatever else you've chosen to take offense to. YTA", "YTA. It's not as if your sister is just some goddess that everyone worships for doing absolutely nothing while you get abused for daring to exist, like so many real golden children. She worked hard for her success and seems to genuinely love you enough to want you in the bridal party rather than asking you for \"appearances\", and your post is dripping with jealousy.\n\nI was jealous of my younger sister for being pretty and popular and having lots of friends and being able to move out by herself and work a full-time job (I'm disabled). She was jealous of me for being academic and doing so well at school and getting praise for getting good marks and for not getting yelled at nearly as much by our mum because I was the \"good girl\" who followed the rules instead of being a typical rebellious teenager like she was. \n\nYou know what we did? We talked it out. We yelled at each other over what we were jealous of the other for, and then we had a good, long talk rather than bottling it up and oozing jealousy. Now we're closer than ever and we give each other advice instead of silently resenting each other. You absolutely need to find some way of dealing with this resentment you have towards someone who did nothing to you or it'll boil over and eat you alive and you'll spend every waking moment comparing every single thing you do to her and making yourself miserable.", "If you don't want to go, don't go. You both arecadults. If you don't wish to have a relationship with your sister, you don't have to. We haven't walked in your shoes and have no business making a judgement on your situation. If she is the golden child, your parents will be so wrapped up with her you won't be missed. Am I right? Go do something with your boyfriend. Take a trip and enjoy life. Life is too short to waste it on toxic relationships.", "NTA. It sucks when another child is favoured over you. I would decline the bachelorette, saying you can't afford it/it clashes with another event/work commitments, etc. As someone else has said, agree to go to the wedding, but be ill at the last minute. \nBf should have your back. That he doesn't is a red flag.  Also I would move away. Like a long way away. Get out from under your sisters shadow.", "NTA. Do what\u2019s best for you. Whatever you do, just realize that there will be consequences.", "Soft YTA. You sound very jealous. Have you talked to a professional to try and work through your feelings and figure out ways to move forward? \n\nBottling it up, or avoiding family functions, isn't the way.", "YTA. Pretty clear the spoiled brat here is you.", "NTA. sometimes, siblings are insufferable and we're better off without them. if you're gonna be mentally better without going to the wedding, skip it. I'm really sorry your parents have a favorite, it messes up with one's life. hang on xx", "Jealous for sure iam youngest of six dealt with what your feeling get over it I figured it out in 9th grade and was happier for it , guaranteed your sister dosent know how you feel do better not for family or sister but for you", "NTA you clearly don\u2019t want to go so don\u2019t go but be upfront about it flaking last second will just cause more trouble in the long run. It does sound like your parents have a favorite and you greatly resent your sister perhaps it\u2019d do your mental health some good to distance from the family and go LC for awhile.", "who's going to take care of the dogs while the parents jet off to celebrate the wedding? doesnt sound like they're good with thinking of the pups while they're eyes are full of stars.", "Pretend you have Covid.", "ooh these people saying you sound jealous and/or bitter are weird. It sounds like you have had to deal with being second best and being used, and that takes a toll on you. You are allowed to make whatever decision makes you feel better, life really isn't that serious. If you want to go no-contact because that feels better, then do it. Want to get sick last minute, then do it. Want to go and see how you feel, then do it. I think that you RSVPing \"no\" will cause a lot of feelings and possibly a blow-up so you have to be ready for the drama. \n\nMy sister was the golden child, I feel you. Just live your own life and don't worry about it so much. You are not required to live in her shadow, you just may have to move a little to get away from it. \n\nNTA", "Nta. Just RSVP no and don't go. And try to get away from everyone asap. You'll be happier without that in your life.", "Super wealthy and only a 60K wedding? Shocking lol. \n\nNTA.", "NTA for not wanting to attend.\n\n\n Beautiful thing about invites they aren\u2019t a court order you don\u2019t have attend \n\nMaybe have a chat with your sister is she even aware of the treatment you received growing up", "NTA - you don\u2019t have to go to your sister\u2019s wedding but boy oh boy be ready for some serious reactions from your family. Additionally, your sister may not know how you feel and could be genuinely hurt by this. Just something to consider. Ultimately, you need to take care of yourself.", "YTA. This is giving Jan Brady and \"Marsha Marsha Marsha!\". Whiny, jealous, younger sister syndrome.  I hope you feel better after venting all that. \n\nYour post  reads as if you are simply bitter and jealous of your sister. To the point where every single thing she does upsets you. Her getting an A+ doesn't take away your A. So why do you feel like it does? You seem mad(?) that she went to an Ivy league school? That is a bizarre reaction. You could really benefit from a therapist to explore these feelings of envy and jealousy that are affecting your relationships. There probably is a golden child dynamic here, but there is a time and place to fight family power dynamics, and their wedding isn't it. \n\nThe point of your post seems to be that you are very upset because she is having an extravagant wedding. And receiving lots of your family's attention while planning a large family event. So what? That is normal for a wedding. And it doesn't affect you all - except that you are obviously jealous.  You should recognize your own emotions are running amok before your overreactions do irreparable harm to your relationships. \n\nThe pet-stting thing is another odd tangent to get stirred up about: if you are a 21yo adult living with your parent's it is completely reasonable to pet-sit while they are out of town - no matter where or why they are traveling. Do you pay rent, or otherwise contribute? If not, then favors like pet/house sitting, are your contribution. You also said our pets not their pets, so I'm not sure if you are sitting, or just taking care of your own animal(s). \n\nMy advice: It would be best if you could keep your own feelings of resentment in check and enjoy participating in your sister's nuptials - and really try to have a great time celebrating with your family.  If you can't do that, then go ahead and skip the event. Not because it is better for YOU, but so you don't ruin the big day of the happy couple with your spiteful, main-character attitude. It's not about you right now, but it could be a real growing opportunity for you. I hope you take it. \n\nHOWEVER if you don't go, of if you go and act like an AH: Do not be surprised if your sourness and unwillingness to participate in your family like a grown adult affects your family dynamics - maybe for the rest of your life. Choose wisely.", "NTA, but be ready for the backlash from your family.", "YTA. You have a you problem. Your sister has done NOTHING terrible to you but live her best life. You sound jealous. Sadly I have a sister EXACTLY like you. \n\nIrs sad", "YTA. Suck it up, go to the wedding and have fun on their dime. Your making a point that you're resentful is not worth creating a giant family drama.\n\nALSO, don't be a doormat. If it's not convenient for to pet sit or whatever else she asks, say no. Have appropriate boundaries, not based on years of resentment, but based on what is real for you today.\nSounds like therapy would be helpful to you - get this chip off your shoulder and shine your own light whether your family acknowledges it or not. The best \"revenge\" is being happy in your own life. Stop comparing yourself. If others continue, thar is their bad.", "According to your own side of the story there is nothing wrong with your sister or the way she treated you. You are just butthurt.\n\nHow is she spoiled in this story? Did she get A+ and awards because they threw money at tutors and expensive schools while you had to figure things out on your own? Are your parents paying for her expensive education while you have to take student loans?\n\nYou should talk to your parents about the pets, but there is nothing wrong with their behavior around the wedding. They are excited to plan it with your sister, like they will be for yours in its time if you let them.\n\nHave you tried being open with them about how you felt all these years? If you do, they will probably make you feel better and more confident, because again according to your own story, it doesn't seem like they despise you. YTA", "YTA. You haven't seen her in five years. How is your parents' recent behavior her fault?\n\nI'm completely sympathetic to the fact that your parents suck, but I don't see why you're blaming your sister for that. Your parents continually compared you to her. She didn't do that. Your parents task you with caring for their pets. She's not doing that.\n\nI suggest doing what you can to let bygones be bygones. Book your travel. Remind your parents that their pets are their responsibility, not yours.\n\nDecline the invitation to be a bridesmaid, if that's how you feel, but don't completely alienate your sister by refusing to go at all. She doesn't sound like the villain in your story. You and her probably have a lot more in common than you realize. She might even dislike your parents more than you do.", "ESH. If you don\u2019t go at all you will be signing up for a world of drama that will last well beyond the wedding and won\u2019t make your situation any easier. You might have legitimate reasons to be upset at your family but it\u2019s obvious by some of the things you\u2019re hung up on that this resentment is taking up way to much space in your life (her bridesmaid requests, for example, are completely reasonable and standard for almost any wedding\u2026you\u2019re upset about a pony tail\u2026really?) so the best thing you can do is go to the wedding, bow out of being a bridesmaid now if you want to, and then make a plan for your future. Stop being a free pet sitter for your parents, stop expecting them to validate you\u2019re career choices. Move out if you haven\u2019t and put your energy into people that show you they value you and put some distance between yourself and your family.", "I take no pleasure in calling YTA here, but yeah. \n\nIt sounds like your parents never made any real attempt to give individual attention to you, make you feel important, validated, cherished. They pit you against her with these comparisons and still treat you poorly, yet you continue to direct your envy/rage/hurt at her. That really sucks, I'm sorry this has festered even while she was out of the picture. It wasn't her fault but you loathe her for having the best of your parents and what looks like a great life.\n\nYou may want to consider how your family will come down on you for not showing. It might just cause more issues between you and your parents.", "YTA. You\u2019re the one who sounds nasty. Blame your parents and teachers who put your sister on a pedestal instead of your sister as it doesn\u2019t sound like she did anything except exist", "YTA", "Well we all THINK we're only going to get married once, not really a valid reason to attend. You are an adult, if you don't want to go then RSVP and move on.\nNTA", "NTA. But it sounds like your parents, teachers etc are the AHs.  Have you ever sat down with your sister and explained yor feelings and asked her viewpoint on the situation?", "NTA. If you don't want to go to your sister's wedding for whatever reason, then don't go. RSVP no, but make sure to expect an angry reaction from your sister and family tho.", "YTA. Take a deep breath and stop comparing yourself to her. This is a super common sister dynamic. You can distance yourself from it but it would be nice if you could set aside sibling rivalry to be there for her special day, which she invited you to with a special role. If you can\u2019t be happy for her on her important day and celebrate her that one day, you\u2019ll regret it later.", "NTA, but realize that just RSVPing no won't be the end of it. She'll have to find a new bridesmaid and other issues.", "Is the only reason you dislike your sister is the fact that your parents doted on her? Did she ever do anything to you maliciously? It doesn't sound like she was ever really that awful to you. You only mention that \"you had problems with her\" but I'm not entirely clear whether those problems are actually caused by her or your own jealousy.", "You\u2019re weird", "NTA. But unwise and jealous.", "I will give this an ESH. If you do not go, it will always make things worse with all relationships and make you look very immature You are still in college (and probably still need parents support and $$). You are too busy with school to do anything for the wedding, so I don't understand how the wedding of the century should take precedence over your education. If the golden child syndrome continues, you can always go low contact with them all after you have established yourself.", "YTA. \n\nNothing you described is even your sister\u2019s doing. \n\nYes, it sucks to be compared to someone. But it\u2019s not her fault that other compared you to her. It\u2019s not her fault if they talk about her. It sounds like your parents and teachers sucked. But, according to this post, your sister has literally done nothing.", "NTA. Go to the wedding, unload your feelings there! Any chance you can volunteer to do a speech at the reception?", "Yta. Golden children get everything handed to them without effort. By your description, your sister achieves highly off her own efforts. It must get wearing to be compared with her. But your level of jealousy is properly pathological.", "NTA, you feel how you feel. Decline being a bridesmaid and bachelorette attendance. Give them whatever excuse will cause the least blowback. Arrive just on time for the wedding and leave the reception slightly early, a 60K party could be fun.", "It\u2019s not an asshole move to skip a wedding if you feel this way about her, even if you just don\u2019t feel like going it\u2019s a good enough reason. Your attitude however is a different case altogether, since you didn\u2019t ask about that I won\u2019t comment on it.", "NTA you don\u2019t owe anyone a relationship, just be prepared for any consequences which I can see you are from the post", "You dont have to go to a wedding if you don't want to.\nYes, the goldenchild does bear some responsibility, but the real issue seems to be your parents and how they compare you with your sister. You should be resenting your parents and not your sister. Also, it's your parents' fault for leaving you with pet care, not your sister's.\nThe stuff with your sister dobbing you in to your folks is an AH move on her part, but kinda a typical sibling thing. You can block her on social media, you know.\nYour sister has no control over how other people treat you because you are her sister. She can't control how her crushes likes all her IG posts. She can't control how your teachers treated you. She can't control that people worshipped her for going to an Ivy League.\n\nIt also seems that your sister has no idea how you feel, considering she asked you to be a bridesmaid.\n\nHave you confronted your parents or sister?\n\nYou are coming across as jealous, envious, and hateful. I do sympathise, It can't be fun to always feel inadequate and an afterthought to your parents. I would suggest therapy and also move out and go LC with your parents. As long as you are in contact with them, you will always be compared to and hear about your sister.\n\nYTA", "NTA -- but you should make it clear to your sister why you don't want to attend.", "I get that it sucks feeling like an afterthought, but reading your post it seems your sister did nothing to you. Maybe address your feelings of inferiority and jealousy with a professional, and have a talk with your family about how you feel like you're not good enough for them. See how they react, and decide whether or not you attend the wedding after this conversation.\n\nOr just don't go while never even talking with them and be TA.", "I mean, you can totally do that,  but be prepared to go nc with mom, dad, sister, etc. Because this isn't something you can give some vague excuse about, this is her WEDDING, & you'll have to explain WHY you not only don't want to be a bridesmaid, but also don't want to go at ALL.

Got an A on an assignment? Sister got an A+ and a national award. Scored a goal in soccer? She got recruited to play on the varsity team as a freshman. Have a crush on a guy in high school? He worships her and follows her on Instagram and likes every photo. Only one teacher my entire life actually treated me like an individual. To everyone else, I was just \u201cX\u2019s Sister\u201d, and treated like dirt for not being her. Our parents can\u2019t get through a sentence without mentioning her and her accomplishments. It\u2019s like I\u2019m invisible, even though I\u2019ve done some cool things too (I have a moderate internet following and have spent a lot of time improving my guitar and songwriting skills). \n\nShe left our small town and went to an ivy league school, and that just made her legend around town even bigger and more annoying to deal with. While there, she met a guy from a super wealthy family and started spending all her holidays traveling with him instead of coming home. So I basically haven\u2019t seen her since she was 19 and I was 16. This has been genuinely good for me, it would have been better if everyone would stop talking about her all the time, but I\u2019ve been able to control my reactions and most people don\u2019t know that I have any problems with her. \n\nNow she\u2019s planning \u201cthe wedding of the century\u201d, literally a $60k blowout bash, and I\u2019m a bridesmaid (\u201cwear whatever you want! But it has to be a stupid shade of powder blue! And no patterns! And wear your hair in a ponytail!\u201d). But I don\u2019t want to go. I don\u2019t even want to be in the same room as her, much less attend her four day celebration/attention fest. She keeps asking me if I\u2019ll be able to make the bachelorette party, and our parents are putting pressure on me to book my flights for the wedding and bachelorette. They\u2019re devoting all their time this year to planning her wedding with her future in-laws, and I\u2019m left behind to take care of our pets. They don\u2019t even check in with me while leaving me home alone with high need animals, and I\u2019ve had to drop plans several times to petsit and take them to the vet. \n\nI just want to RSVP no and skip the wedding. My boyfriend is supportive, but thinks it would be a bit of an asshole move, because I have plenty of experience bottling up my feelings and getting through things like this, and she will only get married once.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not going will ruin the relationship with your parents unfortunately, Idk why she\u2019s screenshotting your pics and sending to your parents, but you are an adult. Idc how strict your parents are, you gotta stand up. Maybe in the future you guys can repair your relationship but not going will damage it even more. Plus with your parents. But maybe being a bridesmaid might mend your relationship with her, and she can stop seeing you as a kid. And see you as the adult you are.

I hope you\u2019ll consider speaking to someone qualified to help you overcome those frustrations so you can have a better relationship with your family and communicate with them when it\u2019s bothering you. Other than your sister ratting you out from time to time (mine did that too), it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s to blame. She seems eager to have you at the wedding and bachelorette.

Just to process the fuckery of your parents.", "How is that your sister\u2019s fault?", "Sounds like you should be upset with your parents, not your sister.", "THAT. IS. YOUR. PARENTS'. PROBLEM.\n\nNOT. YOUR. SISTER'S. FAULT.\n\nHave you processed this yet or are you still banging your head against the \"big sissy baaaaad lady\" wall?", "I don't understand how exactly she's the golden child? It sounds like all her achievements were all well deserved. She seems to be hard working. \nPeople naturally gravitate to those who work hard and achieve great success. It's natural in that sense for her to be popular. I don't believe she was put on a pedestal by your parents, rather, she elevated herself there because she damn well deserved it.", "That's not quite what it means on reddit, it's more a thing that narcissistic parents do (split kids into golden child/scapegoat) as a way to exert control.", "Thank you!  \n\nAnd may I add, that if the OP decides to go with the last-minute emergency option, and she's paying for her own trip, she needs to buy a plane ticket and hotel reservation that are refundable.", "Not a family meeting, your parents are AH. Make it just her and you. Ask her to get together with her before the wedding.", "100%", "Because op is the one that's being a bitter jealous person. Not the sister . I would blame op too", "But don't purchase the travel insurance for your ticket. The airline will want proof that you're ill, and you won't have it. If you lose money on your ticket, you can complain loudly about that, adding to verisimilitude. The monetary loss will be worth it. Book early, so you lose the least amount.", "As an older sister with a younger sister who has manufactured the same perceptions about me, I agree with you wholeheartedly.", "That will not go well.", "Our parents are super strict, so anytime I went out with friends in high school or to a party, she would screenshot social media proving I was there and send it to them. I live at home and she continued to do this even after I turned 18 and started taking college classes.", "I have a feeling that big sis already knows about the favoritism and doesn\u2019t mind basking in the glow of being the golden child.  GC know when they are beloved by all.  It\u2019s the rare GC that sees the disproportionate behavior of others towards their tarnished relative and actually does something about it.", "I agree she\u2019s worked hard, but so do I. She worked hard at college, and I work hard at college, and on top of that I take care of the animals and spend 40+ hours a week on my music. My parents don\u2019t respect music as a career and worship her because she has a fancy Director tier job in a field they\u2019re obsessed with.", "I mean, I would consider myself a scapegoat. Everything I do gets picked apart.", "A lot of places require proof of actual illness or injury because this policy has been abused. I wouldn't encourage this if the money is something that cannot be lost.", "Or just photoshop (or get the photoshop subreddit) to manufacture a receipt for the airline ticket", "So why not just block her on social media so she can\u2019t see your stuff?  Per your original post, she had already moved out by then.  This feels like a lot of made-up drama to get out of going to her wedding.", "If your parents are still enforcing consequences on you for breaking their house rules, that's between you and them. I find it telling that you haven't responded as to why you don't simply block her so she cannot access what you do. You're jealous and bitter. Get over her, and yourself. You'll be happier for it.", "So she told on you for not following your parents rules. There are plenty of siblings that would do that. Your post comes across as whiny and that you're jealous of her success, not that she was actively favored over you.", "Again, you are 21. What is there for her to snitch on? You have been an adult for three years now. Grow up.", "So don\u2019t post yourself on social media doing stupid shit", "Sounds like normal sisterly behaviour", "WTF? What kind of \"friends\" did you have that they'd post anything online that could get back to your parents?", "So your 24yr old sister is already in a director level position? It's hard not to be impressed with that...\n\n\nSo you spend over 40hrs a week on your music? Most people spend over 40hrs a week working. This is a pretty standard salaried work week. Everyone has commitments outside of that. In your case, it's taking care of the animals. This is common with most adults, not exactly what is considered 'above and beyond'. \n\nTake a moment and read back the last line of your comment. It's honestly really sad that there's this bitterness between you and your sister and it's completely unwarranted.", "YTA. The jealousy and bitterness from you is insane. Nothing that you\u2019ve stated is golden child. Your sister worked hard. She\u2019s actually earned her achievements. \n\nYour sister is a director at 24? That IS an accomplishment. That usually takes people years. \n\nOh and sisters do tattle growing up. Mine did all the time.\n\nSeriously, go to the wedding, get therapy. Stop being an asshole.", "But she was actually more succesful so you're jealous.", "What is your issue with \u201ctaking care of the animals?\u201d Is this a giant menagerie?", ">spend 40+ hours a week on my music. \nAre you making any money from said 40+ hours? Do you have a real job?", "Maybe you need the power of lingling /s\n\nI don't think she's the gc", "I think YOU need to be tested for narcissism", "You need to spend some time researching these terms instead of using them so flippantly. \n\nPeople who were raised in dynamics with scapegoat and golden child were often victims of childhood abuse. \n\nThat is DIFFERENT to favouritism, sibling rivalry, jealousy etc. \n\nYou may feel you were the scapegoat. I strongly suggest you speak to a therapist about this to dig down to what the issue/s actually are, instead of throwing about terms you clearly don\u2019t understand. \n\nFWIW if you were actually the scapegoat, you wouldn\u2019t be posting here. You\u2019d be on other support group subs seeking support, resources etc. and not on AITA wanting validation your parents are providing. \n\nBased on the post and your responses, YTA.", "Do that only if you're positive that no one but you can get access to your banking info.", "Probably because everyone else is friends with her so she\u2019d see it regardless?", "I mean, that\u2019s pretty bitchmade", "It sounds like she\u2019s showing up on other peoples posts in photos they\u2019ve taken.", "I actually disagree. My sister and I don\u2019t have a great relationship & we still didn\u2019t do this.", "She\u2019s in college AND working on her music."]}
