And if you usually are involved in child care decisions, making arrangements without discussing with you is inappropriate.", "Many of these responses are wild. She absolutely sprung this trip on her live-in partner of four years. That is not how relationships work. Many of you are twisting yourselves into knots trying to paint the OP as controlling.

That\u2019s 7+ years in the few places that still consider that.  Your view on that might be indicative of the problem? Idk.  Good luck figuring this out.

Who does this? Spring a weeklong vacay a week before and make plans for YIUR daughters care without your knowledge?!   This is a huge \ud83d\udea9 record Aidee this relationship.
