I took my 16yr old to meet my old friends as they have never met him before and we were in from out of state. They invited both my son and I to come. \n\nWhile I knew the host smoked pot and it was a possibility that he might while we were there, I was hoping this person would act his age (50\u2019s) and not take bong hits while my son was in the same room. My son has never been around people who do drugs nor has seen a bong in person. I recall going in another room while his kid was little so his kid wouldn\u2019t see us. \n\nI thought it was inconsiderate of the host to not be respectful of my son\u2019s age and introduce him to that while I was in the kitchen helping with the meal. I certainly wouldn\u2019t do that if they brought their 16 year old to my house, although his kid is almost 30. \n\nI told the host he had never seen that before to hint at my unhappiness and all he said was it was a good first bong to see since it was from Germany.  \n\nUpdate: These old friends know I have been sober for 22 years and I was a hardcore partier doing way worse shit at 13. So I\u2019m not clueless about being a teenager and drugs. Another person who was there also has 5 years sober. We all were wayyyy over the top and did stupid shit when we were young.\n\nUpdate 2: My son agreed I\u2019m the asshole because \u201cmy old friends are losers\u201d and I shouldn\u2019t have taken him. He said he saw pot online but not in person until then. So there you have it. \n\nUpdate 3:  since it has come up over and over, these people had the party knowing we (my son and I) were coming to CA to meet with them and my other old friends. Knowing that they were ALL meeting my son for the first time. So it was a gathering that took place at his home since they didn\u2019t want to go bowling or some other thing to meet up. We all had dinner together. It wasn\u2019t a fucking rager and never intended to be a big party. A dinner party.

The *stories* he tells me shock me even at 42. The one that sticks out the most was about the person that introduced him to heroin and gave him his first hit. There are people out there that actually DO THAT! Like, just introduce someone to bad shit knowing it\u2019ll ruin their life. It ruined him until he was damn near 30 and was finally able to kick it for good. Your story reminded me of that in a very lose way, I\u2019m not comparing the two drugs. It was just the relaxed nature of it that made me uncomfortable on an emotional level. Intellectually, I know it\u2019s different.", "Ok, that changes things, because that makes it more a problem with the host planning an inappropriate party for the target purpose.", "And you confidently said your kid has never seen drugs.... you are delusional to think a 16yo hasnt yet he went to a party with it there. Have you kept him locked in the attic?", "Secondhand smoke is one difference if the kid is in the same room. I know plenty of people who smoke, but none of the adults would smoke in the same room as kids, or even really other adults who don\u2019t smoke. They would be outside or in a closed off room with a vent out of courtesy.", "It was when I was growing up (GenExer) Guess I haven\u2019t come to terms that people consider the same as alcohol. I imagine ur gen Y or Z.", "Maybe you shoulda read the instructions first. If you can't California stop whining and stay home.", "When I was in school some of the biggest stoners were nerds.  When I was at an anime convention in high school most of us did ecstasy the whole time.", "I take it your child hasnt gone to public school then?", "'I'm not stupid'\n\nYes you are.\n\nEven if your son hasn't seen one in person he's absorbed the concept through cultural osmosis already.", "i was a nerd in high school! smoke all the time. nerds smoke now hun lol", "Thank you. All good. I just wanted feedback as to my expectations. I can accept if I\u2019m the asshole which is y I threw it out there.", "He doesn\u2019t go to parties. He is on the spectrum and doesn\u2019t dig big scenes. So yes, I\u2019m confident. It\u2019s bizarre that people don\u2019t get that I know my kid. If he saw it and was at a party he\u2019d tell me if I asked him. I wouldn\u2019t yell at him and use it as a teachable moment. Now would he lie about other shit? you betcha. He isn\u2019t a saint.", "> Secondhand smoke is one difference if the kid is in the same room\n\na bong rip is almost certainly less harmful to a kid than sitting by a campfire...", ">Guess I haven\u2019t come to terms that people consider the same as alcohol.\n\nWe don't, alcohol is MUCH worse than weed.", "You are wrong. I\u2019m also Gen X. Cannabis has always been a plant. Not drugs.", "I\u2019m also Gen X, and you\u2019re both wrong and YTA. You\u2019re acting like the party host was railing coke in front of the kid. That\u2019s a drug\u2026cannabis is more akin to alcohol, and it\u2019s also wildly less harmful than alcohol.", "Pot isn\u2019t the same as alcohol, it\u2019s far far safer", "I'm on medicinal cannabis. \n\nI've never been on medicinal alcohol.", "Marijuana is [definitely a drug](https://www.cdc.gov/marijuana/index.htm).  Legality doesn't change that, just like alcohol and nicotine being legal doesn't change that they're addictive and unhealthy.  I use a dab pen and drink alcohol with complete understanding that they might have a negative effect on my health, and I'm Gen Z.", "Gen X here and pot is not \u201cdoing drugs.\u201d  It\u2019s no different than buying alcohol or a pack of cigarettes. They\u2019re mood altering substances legal for those of age. Period. \n\nAnd if you actually believe - not just agree to accept, but actually BELIEVE - that your 16 year old son has never seen a bong and now will be somehow damaged, you\u2019ve gone way too far down the AA/NA rabbit hole. \n\nYTA and I suspect your old friends think so, too.", "That would be a great place to roll.", "Not sure what public school or private school has to do with anything. It\u2019s about exposure. It\u2019s interesting that no one believes he hasn\u2019t seen pot. Not sure what that says about our culture.", "Not almost certainly, it is. Wood smoke is even more dangerous than tobacco smoke. \n\nAnd WEED smoke? Well, there\u2019s studies that indicate that someone who smokes weed+tobacco is less likely to have lung damage or cancer than someone who smokes only tobacco.", "I'm GenX, too, and am actually prescribed medical cannabis. No one is prescribed alcohol from a legit doctor to help with medical issues. Also, alcohol is highly addictive, too socially acceptable to escape it, and one of the only drugs you can die from detoxifying. Not to mention the number of deaths from drinking and driving; my mother being a part of that statistic.", "Do you not consider opium a drug?", "> I've never been on medicinal alcohol.\n\nI do get the point you're trying to make but I'll point out that you almost certainly have used medicinal alcohol since it is still used quite a bit in modern medicine.\n\nFor example a lot of liquid cold and cough medicines (for example Nyquil) have a small amount of alcohol in them. Plus of course things like mouthwash, hand sanitizer and cleaning swaps all use alcohol as an antiseptic.\n\nFinally alcohol is also used to treat certain types of poisoning for example if someone drinks anti-freeze then drinking regular alcohol will actually help to neutralize the effects of the anti-freeze and hopefully save their life.", "It's a culture where people like weed?", "Your right, I should have said I take it your child is home schooled. Public and Private schools are places where kids often get exposed to things parents wouldn't expect and often would prefer their kids not be.\n\nAs for our culture. Weed is legal in many states in the US now and bongs and wrappers can be purchased in local convenience stores in most of those states. They are often shown in media and even regular commercials now. \n\nI honestly have no clue what you are trying to protect your son from at this point. Knowing it exists and what it looks like is not harmful especially at 16. Parents that try to over shield their children only set those kids up for hard reality walls they run in to when they finally get detached from the apron strings.", "Lol I'm not gonna cast judgement but as a 17 year old lemme tell you. Public schools especially (I've never been in private school so can't speak for those) it is a VERY active drug field. Passing, smoking, the whole 9 yards. I remember my fresh year alone walking to the bathroom was like walking straight into the mist. Hallways reek of pot and cheap dollar store vanilla coconut perfume that the kids spray cuz they think it'll cover it up. Kids will hit up in the classrooms too", "I'm sure he's seen plenty of alcohol, which is way worse for you, but you're not freaking out over that.", "or peyote, san pedro, yopo...", "The opium poppy? No. But opium is a whole ordeal of extraction and turns into pharmaceuticals. Likewise, peyote and mushrooms aren\u2019t really drugs either. Coca leaves aren\u2019t drugs, but the derivative cocaine is. Weed is a dried plant.", "Ingesting something is very different from a topical application. They also sell topical cannabis products for pain relief that have no cerebral effects... The same way rubbing alcohol applied to a cut would not cause inebriation.\n\nI can't take NyQuil and cold meds so no, I don't and haven't taken them. \n\nAlcohol saving a life is SUBSTANTIALLT less likely than it leading to death from alcohol poisoning or resulting in violent crimes. \n\nAnyone arguing cannabis is remotely as dangerous as alcohol has no idea how they affect the body or how easy it is for heavy drinking to lead to alcohol poisoning. There are also a lot of medications that might make someone woozy if if they smoke up on them, but could kill someone if they drank on them.", "Opium just oozes from a cut in the poppy pod and can be scraped off. There is no massive refinement needed.  It\u2019s equivalent to smoking weed.", "That argument falls apart when you take dabs/concentrates into consideration. So flower is nota drug but dabs are? How does that make sense. Dabs also take a whole ordeal of extraction", "You can just cut the opium poppy with a razor and and resin that forms is smokable no extra extraction needed. very similar to curing cannabis buds", "Except Dabs are legal in Southern California.", "That\u2019s good to know. \ud83d\ude09", "Yeah its information I wish I was never in a situation to learn about haha but that was over a decade ago and it always stuck with me how easy it was."]}
