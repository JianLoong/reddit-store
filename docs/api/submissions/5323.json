I took my 16yr old to meet my old friends as they have never met him before and we were in from out of state. They invited both my son and I to come. \n\nWhile I knew the host smoked pot and it was a possibility that he might while we were there, I was hoping this person would act his age (50\u2019s) and not take bong hits while my son was in the same room. My son has never been around people who do drugs nor has seen a bong in person. I recall going in another room while his kid was little so his kid wouldn\u2019t see us. \n\nI thought it was inconsiderate of the host to not be respectful of my son\u2019s age and introduce him to that while I was in the kitchen helping with the meal. I certainly wouldn\u2019t do that if they brought their 16 year old to my house, although his kid is almost 30. \n\nI told the host he had never seen that before to hint at my unhappiness and all he said was it was a good first bong to see since it was from Germany.  \n\nUpdate: These old friends know I have been sober for 22 years and I was a hardcore partier doing way worse shit at 13. So I\u2019m not clueless about being a teenager and drugs. Another person who was there also has 5 years sober. We all were wayyyy over the top and did stupid shit when we were young.\n\nUpdate 2: My son agreed I\u2019m the asshole because \u201cmy old friends are losers\u201d and I shouldn\u2019t have taken him. He said he saw pot online but not in person until then. So there you have it. \n\nUpdate 3:  since it has come up over and over, these people had the party knowing we (my son and I) were coming to CA to meet with them and my other old friends. Knowing that they were ALL meeting my son for the first time. So it was a gathering that took place at his home since they didn\u2019t want to go bowling or some other thing to meet up. We all had dinner together. It wasn\u2019t a fucking rager and never intended to be a big party. A dinner party.

There are people out there that actually DO THAT! Like, just introduce someone to bad shit knowing it\u2019ll ruin their life. It ruined him until he was damn near 30 and was finally able to kick it for good. Your story reminded me of that in a very lose way, I\u2019m not comparing the two drugs.

You may not have taken the road he did when it came to disclosing your past with your child, but that\u2019s OK, too. You\u2019re doing what you think is right for your situation.

His parents maybe should have a convo with him about it and not be treated like a damn 5 year old.", "Yeah, I'm really confused by this thread  I was never around weed until I was in college. People who don't do drugs do exist, including teenagers.", "Thanks for chiming in. Idky people don\u2019t believe he hasn\u2019t been around it. Like it\u2019s unfathomable. my son has never been to a party without parents and I kid you not it hasn\u2019t been more then like 15 ever. Including bday parties since he was tiny. My kid just doesn\u2019t get invited to that shit or decided not to go because he doesn\u2019t want to. He is on the spectrum and is socially anxious. I\u2019d celebrate him getting invited to and attending parties. I had to push him to go to one on Halloween.", "Thanks for your openness and honesty. My son knows the basics of my past. He knows I was a runaway. He knows I did drugs and I share more with him depending on the situation. I haven\u2019t been in jail myself. Just got lucky and never been caught. But I did live in a world of drugs, violence, guns, selling drugs. It was ugly and I don\u2019t want him to start down the wrong path. The shit literally screwed up my mind. Who wants that for their kids. Ya know?", "Now that is downright hilarious. Don\u2019t know why I think that is funny as hell but I do.\n\nThank you sir may I have another. \ud83d\ude09", "You must be completely right. You know all about me and my son. If only I could communicate with you in a daily basis so you could tell me how it\u2019s done.", "I suppose it\u2019s because I associate it with being a drug as in behind closed doors illegal drug. That is how I grew up. That is how the host grew up. We smoked pot behind closed doors - together! The only person who I\u2019ve been around who has done bong hits was my brother and he would never do it in front of my son.", "I'm glad you have a drug of choice. When was the last time your teenager had an energy drink? How's his sleep schedule? Do you know the half life for any of the substances you're talking about? \n\nMy original was supposed to point out the ridiculousness of the ALL DRUGS ARE BAD argument. Most of us injest one or more regularly.  \n\nAs a cannabis smoker, I'm not going to spark up infant of your kid, but I am going to pack my bowl happily at my kitchen counter because it's my house and that's where the weed lives. \n\nA ton of smokers are really fighting the stigma by being as open as possible because they are tried of being treated like \"pot heads\" when they are partaking in a perfectly legal and widely socially acceptable substance. Generally if the situation is appropriate for alcohol it is also appropriate for cannabis.", "If you don't think he'll be damaged, what specifically did you find inconsiderate about it?", "Opium does not come from Marijuana. Completely different plant and substance and high. \n\nNot comparable.", "That's on you not Mr Bongripsofchronic though", "I mean yeah one could see it that way. On the other hand there is a difference between a small family get-together and a larger happening where you are just one of many.", "Actually if his dad has 5 beers a year I\u2019d be shocked. I don\u2019t drink. I\u2019m not freaking out about anything. I\u2019m thinking it was inconsiderate. You don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m trying to understand if my reaction was normal or over the top. And by reaction meaning I wasn\u2019t happy with the situation. I don\u2019t go off in anyone, just trying to process it.", "Everyone judges something. You just judged me.", "Yep! I mean, my husband was what I call \u201cgang adjacent\u201d in that he never joined but was part of them. The guns and violence and just absolute savagery of being in the drug world is insane. I thought it was just Hollywood but turns out that it\u2019s not just Hollywood. And my husband said the same thing as you- if he actually got caught for all he did he\u2019d be a lifer. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t told me all of it. I don\u2019t think anyone knows all of it but him. That life plus the childhood abuse that got you into that life DEFINITELY screws with your head. It also changes the brain physically. Your guys brains don\u2019t look like or operate like \u201cnormal\u201d brains. I think it\u2019s a really good sign that you doing everything you can to make sure your son doesn\u2019t experience that life. \n\nI can respect the hyper-vigilance. It\u2019s coming from a good place. \n\nI also see the irony of your son calling your friends losers. Like, boy, THEY MADE MOVIES ABOUT US!!  \ud83d\ude02", "Lol I don\u2019t have to know your son to know that 99% of teenagers in the US and Canada and the UK have seen drugs. And that most teenagers lie to your parents. You can continue to be delusional\u2026 it\u2019s no skin off my back lol.", "I just asked him and he said he had Gatorade a couple of months ago. He doesn\u2019t even know what energy drinks are by his response. \n\nThat said he doesn\u2019t like to drink soda or pop or whatever you want to call it. His sleep schedule sucks. Thanks for asking. I\u2019d have to look up the half life. I don\u2019t have that shit memorized. He doesn\u2019t drink coffee drinks after noon. At least the ones we have around the house. He does have chocolate at night which could also jack up his sleep. \n\nI can understand your take and I try to get autism more understood and socially acceptable as he is on the spectrum. I can respect your opinion and how you want people to view it. I truly can. \n\nThat said I really didn\u2019t want my friend to expose him to it. I guess it\u2019s my old school way of thinking. I guess I\u2019m one of those I remember when an 1/8 of da kine was $50 and u had to buy it from a dealer people.", "On me. Ok. I asked. You answered.", "This was 1 teen. 3 in their earlier 20s and 7 adults. Not big at all.", "...judging people is the whole point of this sub", "Yes and we are all here judging you at your request. We have all unanimously agreed you are the asshole", "If he is anything like me, he might not want to tell you all of it. And I think that you would be ok with that. I\u2019m glad he got out alive. \ud83e\udd17", "Oh the prices are way better now ;-) and we get to walk into well lit stores and there is more and more research about which parts (terpenes incase you get a research bug) have what effect and you can even just buy those to get the effects you need (ptsd sucks lol) \n\nI get the protective instinct, I'm a mom, if this introduction wasn't what you wanted maybe you could explain it on a medical physiological level so he understands the substances that he might encounter and can make better/more informed decisions (I AM SOOOO NOT TRYING TO TELL YOU HOW TO PARENT JUST AN IDEA THAT POPPED up)", "Equivalently as easy to smoke. Effects are very different mentally and physically it is much more addictive", "I understand that.", "Are u trying to tell me you don\u2019t judge ur friends and family?  I think not. I did ask and you all did answer. I\u2019m fucking old and shit doesn\u2019t work the way it used to. Got it.", "He says he doesn\u2019t want to tell me all of it, you\u2019re right. He knows he\u2019s safe with me and I don\u2019t judge him for his past. I don\u2019t understand exactly why he wouldn\u2019t want to but I respect that he has his reasons. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t even told his psych all of it but I know he\u2019s told her more than he\u2019s told me. \n\nI\u2019m glad he got out alive, too, and I\u2019m glad you did as well. I wish ppl could remember the inherent value ppl like you and my husband have even when you\u2019re in the deepest of dark places. I tell my husband all the time that his value didn\u2019t change with his circumstances- he was as valuable in the middle of the worst as he is now that he\u2019s his best. Same goes to you. \n\nBe gentile on yourself. You did it.", "Appreciate your insights. I really do.", "They werent talking about the legality of any of these things. Just what is and isnt a drug"]}
