Although we were raised in a very catholic country our whole family is atheist. We are not fond of religion however we keep that to ourselves and respect others.\n\nDuring the pandemic my sister discovered muslim side of TikTok. She became obsessed with Islam and spent hours learning about it (which was fine by us). Then she told us she is converting. My family didn\u2019t take this lightly as this goes against what we believe however she is an adult and we respected her decision. Now this is where issues started.\n\nShe started to demand changes in the house to fit her religion. She told us she wants all of the pictures of people or animals down because it goes against her beliefs. She berates my parents when they cook pork because thats a huge problem for her (although no one forces her to eat it). She made my mom feel bad for using gelatin when making a cake although my mom made her a separate one in regards to her beliefs. She started giving me lessons on modesty and behavior, telling me I have to act more like a woman. She asked my parents for an arranged marriage which caused a huge fight because we don\u2019t believe or do arranged marriages in our culture. She said that she cannot take care of our old dog anymore because he is dirty and impure (this broke me). My boyfriend recently moved in with us and initially she was ok with it however now she is uncomfortable because she cannot take her hijab off when he is in the house and that we should move out.\n\nI lost it there. I told her that we have been more than respectful to her but she is taking advantage of this situation and asking for unreasonable accommodations. She then started to talk to me in arabic (not our language). I told her to stop her madness and that \u201cI don\u2019t care about your god, prophet or rules because they are making you act like a bitch.\u201d\n\nShe cried and called me an asshole saying that being a \u201cminority\u201d is hard and she doesn\u2019t want us to burn in hell because we don\u2019t know the truth. Later my mom also scolded me, although she agrees with me, she said I acted harshly.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate 1: Thank you all so much for support and solid advice. I\u2019m literally crying writing this. I miss my sister and I am scared of her extreme behavior. Some of you mentioned mental health issues and I agree, it sounds like a mental health issue. Others mentioned radicalization, and I also agree with that. I talked to my parents. They are looking for a therapist who specializes in cases of religious extremism. I will contact a local mosque and a muslim student association at her college and ask them for their opinion and help. When we have all of the details and help available, we will do an intervention. We will not antagonize her and will try to understand her but also tell her how worried we are and hopefully set some boundaries. I\u2019ll make an update on how that went.", "created_utc": 1679070217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tvuoy/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_i_dont_care_about/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m Muslim myself and Allah is against us telling people that they will \u201cgo to hell\u201d for not being Muslim. In Islam, we must respect others and treat them like equals.", "NTA - you and your family are allowing her to practice her own beliefs and respecting it, she is not extending the same respect to you or your family.", "NTA. Sister needs to move and do as she pleases in her own home. You don't get to force your new beliefs on the rest of the family.", "NTA your sister sounds unhinged", "NTA - your sister changed religion and expects evreybody in the house to accomodate her sudden 'rules'.  Its time for her to move out (although muslim women arn't supposed to live solo i suppose) into some housing that suits her , althoug your parents are probably hoping this phase will pass and shortly she'll find another cause\n\nI strikes me that she WANTS to act persecuted and chose this religion to satisfy this strange desire of hers.", "NTA\n\nYour sister has every right to follow her religion. She does not have the right to ask other people to follow her religion. She is creating a hostile living environment for you and your family.", "NTA. what on earth. if she doesn\u2019t like shit - she is the one who should move out. the \u201chow to be a real woman\u201d and the whole \u201ci am a minority\u201d feels to me as if she is using this newfound religion to overcompensate for something\u2026 especially since a lot of converting happened through tiktok, an absolute shithole of a platform, it gives a whole \u201cextreme beliefs preying on emotionally vulnerable\u201d. you as a family done everything to accommodate her, i honestly dont know what her problem is, she sounds unhinged. her talking to you in arabic is also kinda insane. she needs an intervention and maybe therapy tbh", "NTA, and frankly, I'd look into getting your sister some medical help. Sudden onset of hyper-religious feelings can be an indication of mental issues; it would be good to rule that out.", "NTA.  I'm also an atheist, and tend to keep my beliefs to myself, and I also respect everyone's personal beliefs.  \n\n\nI know this is anecdotal, but I have absolutely never met a Muslim who behaved that way.  I'm sure there are assholes in every religion, (leaving out fanatics on all sides, they don't count) but every Muslim I've personally met (I live in Michigan, there's a sizable population) has been nothing but generous, and kind.", "NTA\n\nBut is there a history of schizophrenia or other mental illnesses in your family? I say this out of genuine concern that maybe your sister is experiencing a mental health crisis and that's why she's latched very hard onto a religion that isn't culturally relevant to your family or national culture. Like it would be one thing if she became Catholic, it's all around you. But Islam seems really random.", "NTA \nI have friends who are Muslim and not even they act this way. Being Muslim means to treat others with kindness and respect others religions. I'm agnostic and even I can respect someone else's religion if they don't try to shove it down my throat. And what your sister is doing is not only rude but as far as I know against what Muslims believe. You can't force someone to convert or follow your new rules just because of your religion. And I suggest that she either talk to a scholar or other Muslims before she goes and says/do the wrong thing to the wrong person.", "NTA\nMuslim tiktoks are some of the worst I have ever seen. Some are great and just Muslims having fun. But, so many of them are just a cesspool of ridiculous rules. It goes from \"Women can only wear heels that don't make a sound\" to \"Sculpting class and photos or paintings of your loved ones are forbidden\" to \"You can never have any contact with someone who is gay because your religion makes rules for other people and they just need to swallow their own beliefs and accept mine, I mean yours\". And I say this as someone who lives in a Muslim family and household. We obviously have piectures of our loved ones and would never remove them. I do art and some sculpting and my family brags to the rest of our very Muslim family that I'm an artist. My mom and SIL still wear heels and they are some of the most devout.\nTrust me when I say be very very careful when following Muslim TikTok because you will get people telling vulnerable and confused people that all the harmless things that bring them joy will send them to hell. It is a rabbit hole.\nYour sister needs some kind of intervention because this is like falling down a Q anon rabbit hole. Contact a therapist or Mosque and see if any sense can reach her that way.\nYour family should not be suffering through this all because fanatics reached someone likely lonely and suffering from the pandemic. And your sister is just going to end up alone and just constantly sad and upset following such fanaticism! Good luck to you", "You need to find a way to get her off tiktok.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her beliefs can govern her life but no one else's. She'll have to get over it.", "NTA she has become obsessive and fanatical and has fallen down a internet rabbit hole. She needs a mental health check up, or counselling.", "NTA but as someone else mentioned, this sounds more like fanaticism / extremism / radicalism as opposed to a healthy and sane interest or conversion.  Please don't ostracize or antagonize her, it may push her further to unhealthy beliefs and practices.  Try to understand what's going on with her and reconnect to that sister you used to know, I hope that she's still in there somewhere and a more moderate worldview will persevere.  Is there a Muslim community or mosque that you could speak to about your sister and perhaps see if they can help her find a less radical interpretation of the faith?", "NTA \nAll religions are stupid.", "The way you phrased about her religion and God etc. was wrong, however, she can't push her beliefs on you. She demanded you kove out because you are with your bf, she is 20, she can move out. Also Hijab is a choice, I've know many Muslim women that did not wear one on a general basis. Sister is in the wormg for trying to force other people into her to follow her beliefs, when it's her life, and she should take her own active way to avoid things against her beliefs if she truly follows them. None of the Muslims I've known have ever tried to push their beliefs on to me, so this definitely seems like a her issue.", "NTA. Sounds like she needs her own space to do as she likes", "NTA she can practice whatever religion she wants, she can't force the rest of you to do it. Sounds like your family has been as respectful and accommodating as is reasonable.

I think most people would have eventually acted similarly in the face of religious fanaticism and intolerance. NTA\n\nYour sister is being an intolerable ass... and one can only hope that eventually she will relax eventually.  My family became born again Christians, and were just as bad... and I really didn't want to spend time around them. Eventually, they mellowed and were ok to be around, but in the beginning...", "NTA your sister is just trying to use religion to controlling and oppress the family.. so she caught on quick!

Time for sis to move out.", "Info: why didn't she raise her objections before he moved in? \n\nIt seems like a pretty obvious consequence for her living with an unrelated male. She can be uncomfortable with that but she should have discussed it before moving in so she could move out if you and your parents insisted", "NTA. It sounds like she may have been radicalized by online extremists. Hopefully you can find some people in your local Muslim community who can talk to her and get her involved with Islam in a healthier way.", "NTA. Look into help groups for her. She sounds like she's gone off the deep end. Shit even look into talking with the local mosque and see if they can calm her down.", "Your sister found Islamists who are stupid. Other muslims also hate them.", "What's so weird about this is I have many Muslim students in my classes and they literally don't care about any of this stuff.  They can sit next to another student eating pork rinds and not flip out. They can look at other people's selfies and even take their own, no problem.  \n\nI'm not saying your sister's faith is not sincere.

I'd have been crueler about it.", "I don\u2019t know much about Islam, but I do know that\u2019s incredibly rude, abusive, and cruel to change one\u2019s behavior and lifestyle and then use that to judge other people, demand that they change and make unreasonable accommodations for them, and then act like a victim. NTA. It honestly sounds like she\u2019s a fanatic or something.", "NTA. You and your family have done all they can to accommodate her and she is abusing that. She isn't respecting your beliefs and how you want to live your life. How can people expect respect when they themselves don't give it?", "As a Muslim , what she is doing is inappropriate. There is no compulsion in Islam, so she can\u2019t force people to follow her lifestyle or accept her beliefs , she should be grateful for whatever accommodations the family gives her .

Her sister's braincells must have started dying at an exponential rate. Chick had no chance man, no chance.", "Hijab is a choice only in certain parts of the world.\n\nMajority of Muslim countries it's forced at a cultural and societal level. See the Iranian hijab protests as an example of how pervasive it was - before people pushed back in that country, and many died as a result.\n\nHijab is a complete symbol of oppression imo. I grew up Muslim for reference. \n\nUnrelated to this whole post, I just hate it when I see people say \"hijab is a choice\" when for the majority of Muslim women in the world it absolutely is not.", "I'm sorry, that has to be distressing.

Changes in attitude, sleep, how often she eats and drinks, changes in how she talks in general (too fast or nonsensical)?\n\nSome mental illnesses have aspects that can include religious obsession, and not only is your sister at the right age for onset but the pandemic easily qualifies as a triggering stressor. \n\nYou might want to talk to your family about getting her evaluated to see if she is healthy.", "Are you sure she isn't having some kind of mental health crisis?", "Buy her a plane ticket to Tehran if she's serious.

When he sticks to his meds and is more grounded he goes back to Christianity. Constantly going between crosses and stars of david.", "Thank you! Its really heartbreaking.

From what I have seen they seem to be normal organization. She goes there to pray but she is not involved with their community to much. I think she gets her extreme views online.", "To be fair they mostly kill other muslims for not being the right kind of muslim or not being muslim enough.", "Yeah that could be really helpful! It would be better to have some older and more established Muslims guiding her, and hopefully through the community she can learn a healthier view and get into the positive things about religion, like helping people and discovering the loving side of God/Allah. I'm also fairly athiest but I think religion can be healthy if it actually comes from a place of love instead of anger and hate.", "Omg I wish I could talk some sense into her. I\u2019m an ex muslim, it\u2019s easy to get sucked into this religion, but a nightmare to leave"]}
