When I asked him to explain his reasoning, he kicked me out of the house. To the extent this has caused conflict in the family, it's only because many people in the family recognize that it was unfair of him to kick me out because of *his* cowardice and prejudice. But I'm absolutely willing to be the bigger person: I'm more than happy to accept his apology at any time or, if he is unable to do that, I'm willing to come to the next family event and continue as if he had never made the inappropriate comment to me in the first place... That way, as long as Dad behaves himself and avoids making additional inappropriate comments, we can move forward.\"\n\nNTA. The reason there is conflict in your family is that the women properly recognize that the men are homophobic AHs.

I can imagine that it makes you feel bad, it is your family in the end that's homophobic, but you also know that that's their problem and not yours.
