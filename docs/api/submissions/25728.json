I pointed out all the behaviors, compared notes on what they knew of said niece based on SIL's updates on the children, and came to the conclusion that we were, in fact, concerned.\n\nMy spouse waited until the next time they were naturally speaking to SIL, and particular niece came up. They asked questions about whether SIL noticed any of the things I had noticed and when SIL confirmed, *then* my spouse gently said that I, a person who had extensive knowledge and history of dealing with such things, had noticed them right away as signs of ED. No accusations, etc.\n\nSIL did a little gentle inquisitive exploration in her home, with her daughter, and lo and behold- niece admits to even more extreme behaviors and it's confirmed she is suffering. Because her parents were loving and supportive, she felt safe confiding in them once they knew what to look for. Having no experience with it before, they had no idea what to even look for or be concerned about regarding her behaviors.
