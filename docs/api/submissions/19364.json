Hair is hair and you're young so obviously it will grow back. \n\nThat being said, you have to think about whether you'll be okay with maintaining your shave or growing it back to full length hair.

Is it about donating to a good cause or just wanting a drastic change?  Technically, it's your hair and you can do whatever you want with it, but you'll have to be prepared to deal with the fallout. It may not seem like a big deal now but \"buyer's remorse\" is a VERY real thing.  I'd say NTA, it's a worthy cause, but are you going about it the right way?

It's saddening that your family had that reaction over something very trivial - your hair will grow back so why do they care?", "NTA", "NTA. I think your mom is maybe afraid that if you shave it all off you might hate it and there will be nothing to fix for months until it grows some. Even though you\u2019re the one who wants it, it is a drastic change that there is no coming back from. I can understand you don\u2019t like bobs and don\u2019t want one.

Not a bob but not a buzz and maybe an in between your mom can handle.", "NTA Your parents have no right to treat you like that. They must be very insecure and thus want to avoid any \"comments\" they couldn't handle.

Do what you want, but you would be may surprised to find out how many people react extremely negatively to cutting off all their hair. Also, you may be surprised with how people may treat you differently. Jobs will be more likely to turn you down. It also leaves some people with a general bad impression. To some, it is a political statement.\n\nI personally have cut off all of my hair several times. I truly am a fan of it. It suits me and the upkeep is simple. I think it's worth doing at least once. But I would not recommend it for any 16 year old. It's more of a \"I've got a secure place in college now. Let me try something different\" kind of thing. The only exception is for black girls and women (Which I am). And that's because it's a lot more common in our community for people to cut off all of their hair.\n\nEven if you are dead set on going for a straight buzz cut, I would suggest you actually just get a pixie cut instead.", "Why are your only options a bob or a shaved head? There's about 20,000 other styles of haircuts in the middle there.

Instead I just had hair below my shoulder blades that I was sick of. So I went to the hairdresser and got it cut into a long pixie length, then went back twice more that week and got it almost shaved with a bit on top. It was the late 90s so imagine all the male haircuts of that time and that's what I had as a female. I didn't care and I felt great. Even my hairdresser commented to my mum how much confidence I got from the first cut to the third. \nThen I had my make friends helping me shave the short back and sides one day in the bathroom at home and one of my girlfriends asked if she could have a go on the clippers. No problems, except my male friend had taken the number 3 off so he could tidy up around the neck... Well, my female friend goes straight up the back of my head like a racing stripe. Haha. And that was the story of how I started shaving my head a zero.\nIt's been 25+ years now and I've still never had my hair grow past my ears. \nYou do you! It's just hair. It grows back. Have fun with it.", "It's your hair. Do what makes you most comfortable. But also research short haircuts more. There are tons that are not bobs! NTA", "NTA.  But please research before you cut you hair.  There are strict guidelines about hair that is donated.  Anything not meeting certain standards will be tossed.  Plus some places will sell the hair.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo 1 or 3.", "NTA\n\n& sorry, but your family kinda sucks here.

What triggered it: I've heard stories from people who have had cancer and underwent chemo about their hair insecurities, and I feel I can do something about that and I want to do something about that with my own since it will grow back eventually\n2. Organisation: Worlds Greatest Shave\n3. Stylists: Still Looking since I want my Parents Approval\n4. Hair Lost: I am, which is why I am willing to give all of my hair\n5. I would love to do this, and if I somehow don't like it, at least I got it out in my young-dumb years", "I have considered it, I just don't want to have a bob immediately. I want to settle into it by cutting it all off first since I'm comfortable with that", "First, I think it\u2019s great that you want to help people, but I do want to point out (having done this same thing so sharing my experience), that when your hair is growing out, not only will it turn into a bob look at some point, but regrowth is *weird*. There were many awkward stages of hair growth that just made me look like I was wearing a helmet instead of having hair. So bear that in mind before you decide. Growing your hair back from a bob will take a few weeks, growing it back from a complete shave is going to take months and like I said, you\u2019ll still look like you have a bob at some point anyway.", "What an incredibly generous and selfless thing you\u2019re doing!\n\nJust to help you make up your own mind about how short you want to go, the average rate of hair growth is about six inches a year. If there is a future occasion that you (not your mom) want your hair at a certain length for, you may wish to factor that time in. There will also be a \u2018bob length\u2019 time during the grow out unless you keep it shorter. \n\nIt\u2019s your body, so you get to decide what you want to do. That goes for your hair and for things like formal dances.", "Have you looked into how and where to donate it? I'm only asking because I was going to do that too a few years ago, and the places that would accept it said they wouldn't be doing it for much longer, that synthetic hair has improved so much that donations were no longer necessary. So just know where to mail it before you get it cut and do whatever works for you! NTA", "I know. I should have elaborated on my comment - it does sound quite flippant to just say it will grow back, but I've donated hair for years (8 times since 1987), and each time it's stressful for me until I'm done. When my fiance was diagnosed with cancer in the '90s, I did the head shaving in support. And it has grown back, and I will donate again and again. I just hope I never have to shave my head in support of someone's cancer journey again; that's heartbreaking.", "Donating to a worthy cause is always a good thing if you\u2019re passionate about that cause. If that is your goal, then you have your answer. You\u2019re cutting your hair. \n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about the upcoming formal & the way you will look for that then talk to a hair dresser about your time lines. Show some pictures of how you might want your hair to look for that event. At some point in the regrowth of your hair, you\u2019re going to probably have a bob look. Maybe you should talk about all the options with a professional prior to making a decision. You may not need to cut all your hair or ever have a bob. \n\nGood luck!", "Hey - I had this issue with my parents too, not wanting me to donate because it was a waste and unfeminine. So I kept growing it until I got to uni and donated then. I had a similar amount of hair to donate as you do now, but with a bob at the end of it. \n\nI\u2019m out of uni now, and living away from home, with a pixie to match. You have a future of wild hairstyles awaiting you :)", "It's your hair. Do what you want with it. It'll grow back.", "I would be careful cutting it all off. Depending on your facial features it will be a massive shock. I have a long face and I went really short, think pixie cut. It was horrid and didn't suit my face.\n\nIf you don't want Bob could you just keep growing and  just leave some length in so the hair sits on your shoulders?", "I understand that, I know. But regarding the soon-bob, I'd just rather not have it immediately, so I'd just want to shave entirely.", "Then that\u2019s 100% your choice. NTA btw."]}
