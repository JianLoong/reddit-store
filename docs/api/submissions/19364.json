To some, it is a political statement.\n\nI personally have cut off all of my hair several times. I truly am a fan of it. It suits me and the upkeep is simple. I think it's worth doing at least once.

Instead I just had hair below my shoulder blades that I was sick of. So I went to the hairdresser and got it cut into a long pixie length, then went back twice more that week and got it almost shaved with a bit on top. It was the late 90s so imagine all the male haircuts of that time and that's what I had as a female. I didn't care and I felt great. Even my hairdresser commented to my mum how much confidence I got from the first cut to the third. \nThen I had my make friends helping me shave the short back and sides one day in the bathroom at home and one of my girlfriends asked if she could have a go on the clippers. No problems, except my male friend had taken the number 3 off so he could tidy up around the neck... Well, my female friend goes straight up the back of my head like a racing stripe. Haha. And that was the story of how I started shaving my head a zero.\nIt's been 25+ years now and I've still never had my hair grow past my ears. \nYou do you! It's just hair. It grows back.

I want to settle into it by cutting it all off first since I'm comfortable with that", "First, I think it\u2019s great that you want to help people, but I do want to point out (having done this same thing so sharing my experience), that when your hair is growing out, not only will it turn into a bob look at some point, but regrowth is *weird*. There were many awkward stages of hair growth that just made me look like I was wearing a helmet instead of having hair. So bear that in mind before you decide. Growing your hair back from a bob will take a few weeks, growing it back from a complete shave is going to take months and like I said, you\u2019ll still look like you have a bob at some point anyway.", "What an incredibly generous and selfless thing you\u2019re doing!\n\nJust to help you make up your own mind about how short you want to go, the average rate of hair growth is about six inches a year. If there is a future occasion that you (not your mom) want your hair at a certain length for, you may wish to factor that time in. There will also be a \u2018bob length\u2019 time during the grow out unless you keep it shorter. \n\nIt\u2019s your body, so you get to decide what you want to do. That goes for your hair and for things like formal dances.", "Have you looked into how and where to donate it? I'm only asking because I was going to do that too a few years ago, and the places that would accept it said they wouldn't be doing it for much longer, that synthetic hair has improved so much that donations were no longer necessary. So just know where to mail it before you get it cut and do whatever works for you! NTA", "I know. I should have elaborated on my comment - it does sound quite flippant to just say it will grow back, but I've donated hair for years (8 times since 1987), and each time it's stressful for me until I'm done. When my fiance was diagnosed with cancer in the '90s, I did the head shaving in support. And it has grown back, and I will donate again and again. I just hope I never have to shave my head in support of someone's cancer journey again; that's heartbreaking.", "Donating to a worthy cause is always a good thing if you\u2019re passionate about that cause. If that is your goal, then you have your answer. You\u2019re cutting your hair. \n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about the upcoming formal & the way you will look for that then talk to a hair dresser about your time lines. Show some pictures of how you might want your hair to look for that event. At some point in the regrowth of your hair, you\u2019re going to probably have a bob look. Maybe you should talk about all the options with a professional prior to making a decision. You may not need to cut all your hair or ever have a bob. \n\nGood luck!", "Hey - I had this issue with my parents too, not wanting me to donate because it was a waste and unfeminine. So I kept growing it until I got to uni and donated then. I had a similar amount of hair to donate as you do now, but with a bob at the end of it. \n\nI\u2019m out of uni now, and living away from home, with a pixie to match.

Depending on your facial features it will be a massive shock. I have a long face and I went really short, think pixie cut.

That way you're not stuck with a bob (they don't suit everyone, I can't wear a bob as it makes my jawline look too masculine) but you still have a feminine haircut that may suit you better.

Think of it as kind of an equivalent to Muslim women who wear a hijab (the rules aren't exactly the same, but the idea is similar.) They shave their head for comfort underneath the wig.\n\nChasidic women actually typically wear a headscarf or snood instead, because many Chasidic rabbis are of the opinion that a wig is too much like having uncovered hair.", "It's your hair, if you want to shave it off then do it.  That's really all this boils down to.\n\nAs a side note:  You should know that the majority of donated hair (up to 80%) actually gets thrown away.  Unless your hair is in *perfect* condition as well as a good length, it's not going to be good enough to make a wig from.  Your hair length is probably fine, but if you're going to donate please make sure to take really good care of your hair until you do.  Get split ends trimmed before going and do a hot oil treatment as well.  If you can stand it, let your hair get greasy right down to the ends before washing it at least once BEFORE the trim and hot oil treatment as well.", "I appreciate the added details and clarification! And am embarrassed that I didn\u2019t know how to spell Chasidic lol.", "You've got nothing to be embarrassed about, both spellings are widely used in English."]}
