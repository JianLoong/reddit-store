He isn't learning anything by bumming off of me and my husband and I just can't support him any longer. All my brother does is stay holed up in his room watching anime and playing video games.

You are being generous allowing him 6 months to save but be aware that he'll hope to extend it the time period or change your mind one excuse at a time.\n\nEDIT: The only AH move for you is if you DON'T throw his lazy ass out. Do you really want your kids growing up with your brother as a role model?", "Tell your family to take him on then! If they\u2019re so high and mighty ask them to come get him and take him in as a boarder. \nThey\u2019re always full of good advice but won\u2019t ever offer their own hand to help out!", "NTA", "NTA to your brother, but honestly, you are kind of being the asshole to yourself, your husband and your kids by letting him get away with this much for this long. You love your brother, but you're enabling him. You're teaching your kids that toxic family members are allowed to exploit you. And you're robbing your kids and husband of the best version of you because you're exhausted.\n\nYou need to realise that he's not going to go anywhere when his 6 months are up. So start making him less comfortable in the house right now. First, give him written notice and cover your ass legally. Change the WiFi password and don't give him the new one. Keep your car or if you don't need the car, sell it for stuff *your* family needs. He can get the bus or ride a bike to the library to job hunt. Put a lock on the fridge. Take the door off his room. Wake him up every morning with an air horn if his chores aren't done. He's way too comfortable right now, and you're letting him be too comfortable. \n\nAnd if any family members complain, tell them thanks for stepping up, and you've booked his ticket to their house. \n\nBut seriously, the fact that you've put up with this for so long says that there's a serious lack of boundaries in your life, and that sounds like it comes from your family. You deserve boundaries. You can set them with your brother and you can set them with any other family member you want too.", "NTA... You are not responsible.  He is.  If he had wanted to make this work he would have. \nYou had reasonable expectations he had the ability to meet.  Ask his parents if they taught him any basic life skills?", "NTA- He's waaaayyyy TOO comfortable!  Definitely time to GROW UP!  He is disrespecting you, your family, and your home. Way past time to go! If anyone is a naysayer tell them to Open Their Doors to him!!", "ESH because you should've thrown him out a LONG TIME AGO. And stealing your kids' food? By not IMMEDIATELY evicting him you became neglectful of your children.", "The best part is that nobody wants to live with him, he's the black sheep of the family because he's a dipshit. I've tried because he's my brother and I love him, but I'm just so tired. I'm definitely going to follow through but I just feel like it's an asshole move.", "I've thought about charging him like he were a stranger because he sure acts like one. The other day he walks downstairs around 2pm (still looking groggy from JUST waking up) and asked me when imma go to the store because he needs food. I go the same day every week, like I have been since he got here. He owes me like 2k for rent fir the first 6m he was here and everything else that we've given him. I know I'll never see it though...", "I love calling hubby my little manbearpig, I think it's hilarious. Also stole it from South Park (one of his fave shows) and that makes it funnier. \n\nRegarding my brother, nobody else will take him. Him and our mom have never gotten along and he's only talked to his dad a handful of times his whole life. Our grandmother is too old and bc our mom is an asshole we have no support system from the extended family, yet they are quich to judged", "This. Tell your parents to take him in if they think you\u2019re an AH.", "Yeah I totally understand the conflicting feeling over booting him out, but seriously, if you didn't would he just mooch off you forever?? Sounds like he's never really had to take responsibility for himself and this might actually be the reality check he needs.", "Just imagine how good it's going to feel when he's gone.", "Tell me someone has addiction problems without telling me he has addiction problems.......(If it were just depression, he'd still have money)", "Yeah no\n\nNot the way things (should) work\n\nEveryone is always SO quick to whine, and complain, but as soon as you try to make it THEIR problem it's \n\n-surprised Pikachu face- what do you mean?  Or they immediately back off and say \"you're fine\" because they don't want to be involved\n\nHow pathetic\n\nEdited, clarity", "He's not the brightest crayon in the box and people are easily able to take advantage of him, which is one of the reasons he's here to begin with. But if given the option I'm 100% sure he'd mooch off of me forever, I just don't want that.", "It's gonna be awesome to have my office back, it's definitely gonna need a deep clean. You can smell the room from the hallways and it's apauling.", "The worst part is that a lot of my family are better off than me and can afford trips to foreign countries, countless vacations, and big ass homes. \n\nThey are honestly just relatives to me, I only count my sister, and my mil as true family.", "How much does he make? Have you asked him where his salary is going to see if he really doesn't want to save or is being taken advantage of?", "Yikes, I hope you get the smell out.", "Honestly same, cause we are just renting this place and leave in a year. I don't wanna be charged for it."]}
