At that point I left because I really didn\u2019t want to argue with them. \nToday I got a text from Max saying I was a huge asshole and demanded an apology. My brother is saying that I\u2019m an asshole for not telling them the cause they deserve to know.

Also as someone with a chronic disability and a cane, I've explained the basic explanation of my condition countless times to people and they don't understand.

I have a cane, and many people expected me to go on long difficult hikes with them. I also do not do well with stairs. My activity level can vary, depending on severity of symptoms. It can vary from day to day. \n\nPeople also generally see in black and white, not the shades of gray. Just because you technically can, it doesn't mean you should. It was a potential emergency and OP's friends don't understand the distinction of circumstance. If the fire spread, did the friends expect OP to stand upstairs waiting for rescue or to burn to death? \n\nIt's really hard keeping up friendships as a disabled person.

You told them the norm for your disability. Evacuations mean risk evaluation, and going down the stairs with assistance is a NORMAL thing for disabled people (like myself) to do in emergency situations", "NTA. You can't use stairs going down because it's unsafe, not because you literally can't walk down them. Shockingly, burning to death is more unsafe, so that case is an exception.

Did it run ahead and get down without even sparing you a glance? Most likely. \n\nWith the friend who's arm you held - did they offer to do that for you or did you just grab the arm? Did ANY of them offer any form of help, believing that you physically could not get down in any shape or form? Anyone who went ahead and just left you is not your friend. I can say with complete confidence, if I was with my group of friends and a fire alarm went off that involved us all having to going down stairs, their first thought would instantly be \"How are we getting NowWithMoreChocolate down?\" AND THAT'S NINE OTHER PEOPLE.

Lol you think people actually listen when told those things anyway? I've told people 4 or 5 times and they still ask me to do things for them that they should know I can't haha. I get you're offering a different perspective, but it gets really old telling every single person everything about your issues.", "What liability of it? She doesn't use the stairs typically, clearly only in emergencies. There is no liability.", "And I've thought a lot about this, because I was perfectly healthy and able bodied for the first 25 years of my life, and of course never could relate or fully understand the difficulties or the frustrations with disabilities or chronic pain conditions. I'm not happy that it happened to me, but I do see it as a silver lining that now I'm more aware of this sort of thing and see the frustration behind it. I always wished others could live a day in in the life of someone with a disability or chronic pain or both, and have that person ask them the same questions over and over. \n\nI know people don't understand because they haven't lived it, so I try my  best to be patient, but when people repeatedly refuse to listen it just gets to be too much. Mine was a spine injury that I fixed with about 6 years of physio, so I got into really good shape and I'm starting work finally with a few hours per week at my own pace, and the amount of people telling me I should be full time doing things that are way out outside my limitations is astounding. Like you said, it's black or white with them. They don't realize I wake up in pain every morning and deal with it at 4 am before the day starts and basically can only do one job option as a new career path haha.", "No but if you're good enough friends to hang out you should feel comfortable enough to get into the nuances with at least one of them. It's not a you HAVE to tell them but for liability reasons I would recommend considering it. \n\nI have a disability and usually tell people so they know how to help me should an emergency occur. I would hate for somthing to happen and my friends get distracted with compounding details about my condition", "Becoming disabled definitely takes a lot of adjustment. I don't know if it gets easier over time, but accepting it and adjusting certainly does ease the grief overall. And maintaining a positive attitude (for the most part) helps. \n\nI'm glad to hear you have some semblance of independence, and that you recognize your boundaries and listen to them. It can become a slippery slope, bowing to peer pressure. I've been there enough times. My disability was from a medical condition and probably genetics, and it started before I was a teenager. The height of peer pressure. It took me years to undo that conditioning. \n\nI'm almost 30 now and doing a lot better. I don't maintain friendships if they can't understand. I can only explain so much, and if they don't understand, it's as simple as that. I don't hold it against them. The relationship just wasn't a good fit. \n\nLike people in your life, many people in my life don't understand either, but they don't ask or shame me for it (and I keep some distance from those that do), so it's fine. Health and success looks different to everyone.", "\"Health and success looks different to everyone\" perfectly describes how I feel about life now :) This year I actually found all the silver linings in my injury and to be honest, there are almost more silver linings at this point than there are downsides, which I never thought I'd say. \n\nIt does take a long time to figure these things out though, and to figure out how to sort through relationships based on how well the other person actually listens and puts in effort to understand. Glad to hear you're in a better place and gotten past that 'figuring it all out' phase! Best of luck to you :)", "Max is... the dumbest pile of $#!+. He really needs to learn critical thinking skills. \n\nI am in a similar situation.

It\u2019s kind of scary how similar our situations are (especially since you used to be a gymnast). I had a situation in reverse, in which a bunch of kids broke my dorm\u2019s elevator during a dance, and my date had to help me upstairs. It hurts me to go up and downstairs, and it hurt me then, but I did it so I wouldn\u2019t have to spend all night in the dining hall.\n\nI\u2019m so lucky that my date and my roommate didn\u2019t judge me for it. My date just made sure I got upstairs okay, and my roommate walked my date out for me. I might have broken down if ANYONE accused me of faking it.

She\u2019s surrounded by jerks.", "If there is an emergency and she needs to use the stairs her friends can know what risks exist, ie if it's a putting weight on a certain part of her body vs a brittle bone vs just unfirm.\nPersonally, I'd rather my friends be aware of any special care and I'd rather be aware of the needs of my friends. \n\nIf they forget the nuances that's on them, but if you never tell them and end up hurt because of mishandling the situation that's on you and avoidable."]}
