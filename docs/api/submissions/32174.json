You admit she's not \"tech savvy\" but I don't think you understand what that means. Once upon a time, before smartphones and Wi-Fi, people prepared for a trip by planning everything in advance. They couldn't use GPS, so they learned the route on a map. They couldn't check \"what this place was\" online, so they read guidebooks. Your mom says you should do this when planning a trip, so you can answer her questions. You can't because you are doing it \"tech way\" and she doesn't understand how it works.\n\nNow you are stressed and you're taking it out on her.
