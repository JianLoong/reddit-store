Second, you made a very reasonable statement. You need to spend less money and save more. Third, he hasn't offered to pay for you. Fourth, he took this as an opportunity to say \"we won't go out anymore.\" Fifth, I am sorry, but he's not that serious about you. My advice? Even if you're upset about it, cry to your friends if need be, but to him you can appear to shrug and say \"okay.\" I'm an older woman, and looking back, that's the advice I would give to my younger self, to feign that I didn't care.   \n\n\nI advise EVERY woman to read \"He's just not that into you.\" It's a book that came out at least 15 years ago, but it will always apply. Read it, believe it.", "NTA... If he said he \"doesn\u2019t care how much he spends on the relationship\", why don't you suggest to him to split any bill from going out according to income and see what is his reaction?", "Nta. Find a better boy friend", "NTA.  \n\nAlso, his insinuation that your desire to be financially responsible means that you care less about the relationship is a major red flag. Take a close look, he may be manipulating you in other ways, too.", "Nta, he basically threw a temper tantrum. he is not showing you any compassion for your goals and where you want to be instead throws a fit..", "What is it-he either \u201cdoesn\u2019t care how much he spends in\u201d your relationship\u2026 or he insists you pay your half?\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t want to be \u201crestricted\u201d, then he can start paying for some of your outings. Mr Money-pockets over here, with double your income.\n\nHe sounds like he is trying to get you to dump him with this little foot stomp that you just won\u2019t go out together at *all* if you can\u2019t do whatever he wants. All the time.\n\nYup, it sounds like he is too delicate to break it off, so he wants you to do it. NTA", "NTA.   He makes double you do, split bills 50/50 and still expects you to keep up with him.   That's not fair at all.   I've been in your situation, but we didn't split bills the same.   We calculated, based on income, a similar percentage of major bills.   So for the rent we each has around 20% of income going to that.   He paid more of it, but equal percentages.   I'd suggest you try to work on that.   As it stand now you're actually paying more into the bills than he does so not even taking into account the disparity of income, he has more.   If he's not willing to do something like this you're not in the same page and need to get there or move on.", "NTA - your financial stability is important. He needs to respect your rules towards maintaining healthy spending habits for yourself. It's not that he doesn't care how much he spends - if you ask him to spend an equivalent of \u00a310000 on a luxury vacation for you both, would he do it? Probably not, which is exactly what you're doing, trying to limit expenditure to what's acceptable and feasible for your income.", "NTA - first of all, 50/50 doesn't sound fair. You should be calculating the split based on how much each person makes. Second of all, even after adjusting for that, if it's still top much money for you, he needs to respect your financial decisions. If going out a lot is so important to him, he can chip in more than his share and/or compromise on going out less.", "NTA\n\nWhat a manipulative dude you've got in your life. If he wants to go out several times a month and you don't have the funds to do so, he can suck it up and pay for you. He's now acting like a child having a tantrum because he is not getting exactly what he wants all the time. Re-think a relationship with someone who tries to be that controlling and a bully.", "NTA. You expressed your boundaries and he is trying to either dismiss or exaggerate them. Let him cool a bit, but stand your ground. Calculate for yourself how often you can afford to go out or how much you want to save, and when it gets to it - you either start having cheaper entertainment time together (going out for picnic or walk in the park instead of drinking in a bar) or just stay at home and have chill time at home. Your boyfriend is older than you and in a different place in his career, with different income. You don't want to be spending all your money on him, you want to be saving for your own future. If he really wants to spend time with you it won't be just going out spending money.", "**He said that he does\u2019t care how much he spends on our relationship and going out because our relationship is important to him.** \n\nIf that were true then he wouldn't be having you pay for half of everything when you can't afford it.   Is this a case of YOU insisting on paying half even though he's willing to cover you OR is it a case of him insisting you pay half of everything despite having far more discretionary income than you?", "NTA - he needs to respect your budget or not spilt everything 50/50. Fair and equal are not the same thing. If HE wants to go out more often and HE can afford to pay more HE can pay more.", "NTA you two have different goals in life. Need to discuss if this relationship will work.", "NTA sounds like he resents you for wanting to be financially responsible and maybe a little for making less than him and not being able to keep up. Both are concerning and his response demonstrates a lack of maturity for someone his age.", "NTA. If you don't have the money, you don't have the money.\n\nAnd if he can't think of entertaining things to do w/o spending money, then he's more interested in going out, than in being with you.", "Info: is he going to pay for the both of you for all the dates then?", "What in the third grade mentality is going on here?  \n\"I don't want to feel restricted, so I'm gonna restrict it completely!\" Grow up, dude. It was a reasonable request.  \nNTA", "NTA And why the hell are you paying for yourself every time you guys go out? If he wants to go out he needs to spend money on you not just himself. Point blank", "NTA! Did you ask him if he was willing to split 75/25? Do not go broke to make him happy.", "Going out, like buying a bunch of food and drinks at bars? Several times a week? In this economy? \n\nSeriously though... Inflation is wild right now. N T A Extremely reasonable to cut back and want to do less expensive hobbies. You can still go out, just not to bars or restaurants. There are other places, or cheaper places. \n\nHe's the asshole for saying you shouldn't do anything anymore ?? You need to stand your ground and refuse to spend money frivolously. Offer other activities though like hanging out at a park or something somewhere, only going during happy hour specials. \n\nAnd if he doesn't like that then fuck him. Even if he makes more money than you, it would be beneficial for him to save, too, and put into a high yield savings account.", "NTA, how about you split not 50/50 but income-proportional? If he also refuses this, then he is an AH", "NTA. Your bf earns more than twice what you make and shows not one iota of understanding about your finances. His all or nothing/\"my way or the highway\" attitude about money WILL follow you into a commitment like buying a house or marriage. This is a big red flag you shouldn't ignore. I really hope you are not close to buying a house together as I think it would be disastrous for you. Please examine this attitude with a long-range lens. Good luck, OP.", "NTA - Honestly, it sounds like he isn't mature enough to be in a relationship. He essentially just threw a temper tantrum when you said you want to be more responsible with money. Close your eyes and picture yourself talking to a toddler. You say \"honey, i need to cut back on spending to improve my savings\" the toddler gets huffy puffy, stops his foot and says \"I don't wanna cut back! Fine, we won't do nothin'! I don't care\" with a big lower lip sticking out. That's what your man sounds like...is that really what you want to attach yourself to? This doesn't seem like a man you can depend on when times are tough.", "This is not a good partner. He is manipulative, selfish, narcissistic and mean. This isn't what love feels like\nIf he really didn't care what he spent on the relationship, he'd pick up the tab more often. He's way too old to be making you overextend yourself financially. And they way he deals with conflict is really immature and problematic. These are red flags. This isn't what healthy love looks or feels like. You'll save money and sanity by ending this lopsided relationship. \n\nNTA.  Run.", "Run like hell, girl! He\u2019s too old to be so immature. Put that on your list of qualities that are important in a partner.", "NTA\n\nThis guy is not worth wasting any more time on. Cut your losses and leave now.", "NTA.  Yeah, this ain\u2019t the guy and he\u2019s acting like a baby.  He only cares about himself and his whole manipulative tantrum is gross.", "He's 8 years older than you,  makes double what you earn and you pay 50/50?

So maybe sit down and set a percentage that you are willing to use per month towards your outings? That\u2019s how my friends went about it and it works great. My best friend makes quite a bit more than her boyfriend. He moved into the house that she already had and was worried he couldn\u2019t go 50/50 with her.
