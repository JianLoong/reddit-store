We both thought it was PPD related. Just after the second arrived, my son and his wife separated. She would bring the kids over for a visit, it was then she began unloading on us. I know there\u2019s two sides to every story, but considering I know my son, I believed her. I sat my son down numerous times to speak with him regarding his marriage. He refused to take responsibility, blamed her for everything even when I directly pointed out where he was the sole problem. \n\nThey got into counseling, for a year things were \u2018ok\u2019 on the surface. Our DIL filed for divorce, my son 3 days later was on Facebook announcing his new girlfriend. A month later, they were engaged. My son had forced his then wife to become a permanent SAHM at the birth of their first child. She of course had no other family or friends here, she knew no one aside from us. She had nowhere to go with two small children. Unbeknownst to our son, my wife and I helped her financially and got her an apartment. \n\nBefore the divorce was even finalized, we received a wedding invitation. I made it clear to my son, I would not be attending and they would not have my blessing. His mother told him she would see to it that I would attend. I stayed consistent in my decision, I also asked him not to bring his fianc\u00e9e around our house out of respect for the mother of his children. \n\nThe wedding happened on Feb 11. The night before, my wife gave me the finial push. I did not attend. Our daughter, also did not attend for the same reasons. My wife picked up our grandkids, got them dressed and attended the wedding. My daughter and I decided to spend the evening with his ex. I couldn\u2019t imagine her sitting alone, while her kid\u2019s attended their father\u2019s wedding. \n\nShe was taken aback that I didn\u2019t end up attending his wedding. We took her out to distract her mind. I just wanted her to know, she\u2019ll always be considered family to us. My daughter also made a joke they can drop the in-law status and just be sisters now. She was very tearfully grateful, I realized just how badly she needed our support and specifically on that night. \n\nThe next morning, my son called to tell me how much of a horrible father I am for not attending his wedding.

(Watched that happen in my family). With his lack of maturity, he probably doesn't even understand that he did anything wrong, or if he does, doesn't know how to work through it and accept his part of the responsibility.

I feel like it's hard to fully judge without knowing the issues of a marriage, but based on the timeline you shared of your son's 'girlfriend' announcement, it speaks volumes. Your daughter aligning in your views also says something about the arc of the relationship.\n\nI think it's very brave for you to see your daughter-in-law (I guess now she's your daughter-in-love, not law) as a person who most needs family and your support. \n\nStanding with your beliefs may have cost you a relationship with your son, and likely with future grandchildren. But it will have profoundly impacted the life of some very real humans in your life now. \n\nSometimes family comes to us outside of blood. It sounds like you found someone you genuinely brought into yours, and don't want to see wronged, even by another family member. NTA, in my opinion.", "NTA, when you get into a relationship and specially when you have children with someone, you put that person into your family's life and they might end up bonding.\n\nThat's a risk you take, and if the way you harm the other person makes your family/friends side with your ex rather than with you, then that is a natural consequence of putting two people together and then harming one of them. The other might just chose to support your ex rather than you", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI don't understand people that think you are required to side with family members regardless of their decisions.  \n\nFrom the sounds of it your son wasn't faithful to your DIL.

Child support left him homeless, so he lived on a friend's little sailboat for 8 years. It was not a \"nice\" boat. There was no place for the children to come for visitation.

I say no.\n\nTypically the abusive behaviour you see from toxic estranged parents is a refusal to stop treating their children like kids. But you are treating your son as an adult. Your reaction would be totally normal coming from a friend or coworker of his. Family is not a relevant factor.\n\nMaybe he was certain his dad would always be in his corner, but if that was an issue, he should have sat you down and talked to you about it.

Make no mistake - with the refusal to attend the wedding, send a gift, or even pass along congratulations, you have effectively decided to disown your son. And that's fine. Breakups happen. They're not just for partnerships that don't work out. You are well within your rights to say \"this is spousal abuse, this is abominable treatment of the mother of my grandchildren, and I will not stand for it\".\n\nThe only *possible* issue is that, should your son repeat his pattern of behaviour with DIL #2, I don't see anyone well positioned to help her (or any future grandkids from that union).
