The way your post reads, it seems like the idea of moving to Europe was discussed casually (like pillow talk) but not regarding this specific situation until the offer came.\n\nAlso, can you clarify your recent comment? I believe it said she cannot go. So, is she choosing not to move or is there some sort of restriction that does not allow her to move?", "NAH probably. If she \"always said\" she wanted to move with you, but wasn't involved in the concrete planning, you just have poor communication. If you planned it together and now she's backing out, she's changing her mind. Has she given you reasons? Have you talked about it? She can of course decide not to go--but can't \"veto\" *your* move. That's the difference between her life and your life.\n\nIt sounds like you have a lot to work out, as there's a house involved, but doing what you want in life is important. If that's different for two people in a relationship, they often break up over it.", "NTA\n\nYou are following your previously announced dream. Your GF changed her mind and no longer shares your dream so she will be left behind; such is life.", "NTA. This was the plan, she's allowed to not want to do it but she cannot and should not try to stop you, she should simply recognise if she no longer wants your shared goals she should get off the bus.", "NAH \n\nBut I think if you don't go you'll regret it for the rest of your life", "NAH - you went into this relationship thinking you had shared goals, you had her support when applying for this job, you even had a plan established for your house while you\u2019re gone. She changed her mind, which she\u2019s perfectly entitled to do, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay. Ultimately, you\u2019d probably resent her if you don\u2019t see this through. And that\u2019s not good for anyone.", "NTA for wanting to move as you both planned but potentially one for bailing on the house you own together. That is unless you can buy out her share and she can afford it on her own. Why not give her chance to visit your new city and get over her fear of moving/ selling the house. Is she upset you want to move or is she upset you decided without including her in the decision making? If she feels you do not mind if she agrees or not, it might not be the move she is doubting but actually you and your feelings for her. The risk she fears may be you.", "NTA. And she doesn't have any veto rights. She does have the right to be upset that you are leaving but she could apply for jobs and find a way to join you. Take the job and go enjoy yourself.", "NAH I was the gf/wife with cold feet and my partner was the one with the job in the EU. I ended up going to keep the relationship. The first 18 months were really, really, really difficult for me\u2014and I\u2019m still not confident our relationship will survive our immigration abroad, even though now I\u2019m really enjoying our new city and my new career. \n\nIf you two decide to go together; make sure you both support each other more than you ever have before, because you will both be having wildly different experiences if one partner is the trailing spouse without a job and moderate cold feet. It will be way easier for you than for her, so bear that in mind.", "You\u2019re not married and there are no children. You may never have an opportunity like this again and you\u2019d probably have a lifetime of regret if you didn\u2019t go! \nYou just have to ask yourself which you would regret more\u2026leaving your gf or not taking the job.

But does it make me the asshole because I\u2019m the one physically leaving?", "That is the approach I am going with. The fruits of labor haven\u2019t been picked yet. Let\u2019s see. Also love the optimism of when arriving in Belgium", "How about she is the AH because she is going back on their plan to move to Europe?", "Well I disagree.

Assuming this move ends your relationship, she could similarly try to force a sale of the home to recover her investment, make you to buy out her share, or any other number of scenarios.

If you go alone you might get lonely at first before you acclimate. you have to make new friends, learn the culture and stuff like that", "YTA for presuming that she\u2019s just pick up and go to Europe if that was never expressly stated as a concrete goal at any point. Having a mortgage together also sends some wildly mixed signals too if you\u2019ve been serious about this. I agree that you should go if this is really and truly what you want for your career. You\u2019re 28 and these opportunities don\u2019t just appear all the time.

Generally speaking wages here are worse than in the states", "NTA. It's your dream, do it! You'll regret it later, if you don't. She changed her mind, then she can stay. That's fine. If she doesn't want to follow at some point in the near future, maybe you're not meant to be together bc of different life goals and it's better to break up.", "NTA.  If you don't go, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.  You'll also resent her if you stay, so you wouldn't be saving the relationship anyway.", "NAH, but you\u2019re trending toward TA. Sure, you\u2019ve both been dreaming about this, but writing as someone who has moved from the U.S. to a European and an Asian country for work\u2026you don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re looking at this realistically. \n\nWhat\u2019s the visa situation look like for your gf? How are her language skills? What\u2019s her employment outlook in Belgium? How will she build a social circle while you\u2019re working? How close is he with her family? Do you have pets? \n\nI can tell you, moving abroad was worth it, but it was in no way easy those first few months. And it is ALWAYS more difficult for the spouse, who usually arrives with no employment possibilities, and who is expected to take care of the household. And you\u2019re not married, complicating even the easier stuff. \n\nSo, NAH, but consider the tone you\u2019re using to talk about your gf here. Consider how her experience would be different and likely more difficult. I\u2019d be more worried if she just jumped into this\u2014cold feet can be warmed, maybe, but it needs to be done with calm, rational discussion, not playing the blame game.", "NTA- go live your best life and enjoy it!", "NTA, you've always been open about your ambitions and your gf changed her mind. You guys just have different goals, and hey there's always the option of long distance relationship", "Did you _discuss_ this as a hard and fast goal, or did you _assume_ she would want to move to overseas if the opportunity presented itself? Love of traveling and exploring other places does not equate to _moving_ to another place.

I'm not sure why there are so many comments that say NTA.\n\nPeople's dreams, ideas, and expectations out of life change. She probably realized she now has a cushy, comfy home, a long-term relationship, (likely) a dual income household, and stability. Both of you already own a home. Now you're willing to throw that stability away to pursue an old dream of moving overseas, while leaving behind everything else that both of you have been working for, and possibly while leaving her unemployed during your time working there.\n\nFrom her perspective, I can see why she veto'd your decision. The fact that you took the job anyways regardless of her wishes shows you have little empathy for what she wants. This move would be a deal-breaker in a long-term relationship like yours, and you should expect to be \"bought out\" if you end up moving forward with this job.", "NTA. If you really saw a future with your gf find out why she changed her mind.  Prepandemic it was my goal to move to Belgium for a couple years. My bf decided he didn\u2019t want to leave for years, it was bc his dad isn\u2019t in the best of health, so we postponed the trip and settled on a shorter trip to a different country.", "She can't veto your life \ud83d\ude02 you're nta", "NAH - You will both just find other relationships", "Didn\u2019t take long for you to move on from that 5 year relationship, did it?  \ud83d\ude44\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a cis man from The States and hoping to meet people here in Antwerp!

These levels of complexity haven\u2019t been able to be discussed yet. But this is good to know I should address!", "This is a very insightful comment & should be much higher. OP doesn\u2019t seem to have considered her side of this at all. He\u2019s getting a once in a lifetime chance at a dream job & she\u2019d get . . . him, but only if she gives up her house, her home, all of her family & friends, her job & everything else. \n\n\nShe\u2019d be making huge sacrifices but is he giving her a reason to do so? He\u2019s ready to move across the ocean without her & leave her with a complicated real estate situation so doesn\u2019t seem to be in this for the long haul.", "OP mentioned in a comment that she knew he was applying to the job and was supportive. That fact alone changes my vote to your position!", "Based on OP\u2019s comments, this never sounded like a real agreement, but rather a \u201cdream.\u201d  They have never discussed any of the actual logistics of moving to another country and what it entails for her.  Even if she was still 100% on board with this, the chances of her being able to move there are very slim since she is unmarried and doesn\u2019t have a job lined up that would support her visa. Immigration is never as easy as people think it\u2019s going to be. Like every time we get a new president in the US, people from the losing side declare they are moving out of the country. And none of them ever do because it\u2019s not easy.", "GF doesn't have veto power. She doesn't get to dictate his life because she wasn't honest about her changing feelings about moving. They have spoken about this move for years, going as far to say they will rent out their home (income for her) when they move. She is just like someone saying they don't want kids just to say different after the wedding. She is the asshole for not being honest with him. She wasted both of their time by playing the it will never happen, I can say I want to go game and then getting demanding when he got the job. The job she knew he applied for. \n\nWhere is her empathy, trying to crush his dreams by lying about her wants?", " Not the A H per se, but you are choosing your dream of living abroad above her. Which you have every right to, but it does show that moving is more important than being with her. She has every right to change her mind and not go, and in doing such she is choosing her reason stay above you. You didn't write why she changed her mind so it's hard to decide who has the most important reason to stay or go. But eitherway: if you would resent her if you didn't go, iust go and accept that it will probably be over between you.", "I don't think you're the asshole for wanting to go, any more than she is the asshole for not wanting to go.  Of course, you both have plenty of potential for behaving like assholes about it at this point\u2014or, for behaving as your best selves and seeing whether this means you still have a relationship or not.\n\nPersonally, I think it's the dreams you give up on that you regret the most, so I don't at all blame you for wanting to go.  But, she chooses differently.  Essentially, neither of you wants to give up something for the sake of your relationship, so\u2014what now?", "Thanks for clarifying. You're NTA, she is. She should have shared her true thoughts when the role was discussed. Good luck with everything!", "If she was bluffing is the case, I can only say: play stupid games, win stupid prizes", "Fwiw, having once been in your gf's position -- potentially going abroad with partner, unmarried, expensive country where I didn't speak the language nor could easily work -- it may not necessarily be she lied to you. It could be once the realities set in, she's rethinking things. In my case, I didn't think the offered salary was nearly enough to live on (it wasn't), I wouldn't have been able to work, and being unmarried I worried about my lack of legal protections. It was a great idea on paper, but the facts just didn't add up. And also the thought of being away from everything I knew was harder than I anticipated.\n\nI'd actually still like to do it, if the chance comes up, but I have a much better sense now of who I am and what I need to be ready for.", "How have none of these things come up yet in discussing moving to a foreign country?  Everything AstroDocJr wrote are basic things to consider when moving abroad.", "Nah, if I were the GF I wouldn't sacrifice anything for OP unless he \"put a ring on it.\" Best for both of them to part ways.", "I don't think she lied. My guess is, neither of the two made real plans for the logistics and how they would actually live abroad.", "Wa a typo. She is of course allowed to choose not to go with me*", "Visa laws.  She can\u2019t work in Belgium unless she finds a job there that would sponsor her work visa, which is highly doubtful unless she has a specialized career and a company looking for that specialization. So she would only be able to stay there as a tourist and be limited to 3 month stays.\n\n\nEdit: I know OP clarified that he made a typo, but my comment still stands.", "Yup, 100% chances OP will be bought out. And maybe that's OK - OP will get a lump sum and do whatever he wants with that money. I just don't see this relationship lasting."]}
