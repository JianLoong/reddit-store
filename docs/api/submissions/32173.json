You two agreed that that moving to Europe was a mutual goal and life aspiration. She knew you were actively pursuing that goal, and (presumably) supportive of it. Then you get the opportunity to go, and she \u201cvetos\u201d it. Which\u2026 No. She can say she doesnt want to go. But you can still 100% go. \n\nThe house ownership is gonna be something to deal with. If you two are serious about making things work, you can try an LDR. But man, imo she sucks for acting so supportive and on board with the idea, but as soon as it becomes a reality, she bails. I\u2019d be livid, and hurt.", "NTA you have worked hard for this and she can stay if she wants.", "INFO Is this a longterm relationship in which you live together or otherwise share living expenses, or are you just dating? That makes a big difference.", "I don't see that anyone is right or wrong here, unless you have made a lot of assumptions about your girlfriend's willingness to move abroad without any justification.  She's allowed not to want to go, and you are allowed to want to go.  \n\nNeither of you can force the other to comply with your own wishes.  Now, you just have to figure out what happens next.\n\nNAH", "tell her that you want her to come. Tell her nicely and calmly with a smile. Should she refuse smile, tell her you love her and respect her decision. Hmm.. on another note You can get a new hot young wife in Belgium.", "Why are you even asking? you\u2019ve made the decision for both of you and sounds like you don\u2019t plan on changing your mind.

The way your post reads, it seems like the idea of moving to Europe was discussed casually (like pillow talk) but not regarding this specific situation until the offer came.\n\nAlso, can you clarify your recent comment? I believe it said she cannot go. So, is she choosing not to move or is there some sort of restriction that does not allow her to move?", "NAH probably. If she \"always said\" she wanted to move with you, but wasn't involved in the concrete planning, you just have poor communication. If you planned it together and now she's backing out, she's changing her mind. Has she given you reasons? Have you talked about it? She can of course decide not to go--but can't \"veto\" *your* move. That's the difference between her life and your life.\n\nIt sounds like you have a lot to work out, as there's a house involved, but doing what you want in life is important. If that's different for two people in a relationship, they often break up over it.", "NTA\n\nYou are following your previously announced dream. Your GF changed her mind and no longer shares your dream so she will be left behind; such is life.", "NTA. This was the plan, she's allowed to not want to do it but she cannot and should not try to stop you, she should simply recognise if she no longer wants your shared goals she should get off the bus.", "NAH \n\nBut I think if you don't go you'll regret it for the rest of your life", "NAH - you went into this relationship thinking you had shared goals, you had her support when applying for this job, you even had a plan established for your house while you\u2019re gone. She changed her mind, which she\u2019s perfectly entitled to do, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay. Ultimately, you\u2019d probably resent her if you don\u2019t see this through. And that\u2019s not good for anyone.", "NTA for wanting to move as you both planned but potentially one for bailing on the house you own together. That is unless you can buy out her share and she can afford it on her own. Why not give her chance to visit your new city and get over her fear of moving/ selling the house. Is she upset you want to move or is she upset you decided without including her in the decision making? If she feels you do not mind if she agrees or not, it might not be the move she is doubting but actually you and your feelings for her. The risk she fears may be you.", "NTA. And she doesn't have any veto rights. She does have the right to be upset that you are leaving but she could apply for jobs and find a way to join you. Take the job and go enjoy yourself.", "NAH I was the gf/wife with cold feet and my partner was the one with the job in the EU. I ended up going to keep the relationship. The first 18 months were really, really, really difficult for me\u2014and I\u2019m still not confident our relationship will survive our immigration abroad, even though now I\u2019m really enjoying our new city and my new career. \n\nIf you two decide to go together; make sure you both support each other more than you ever have before, because you will both be having wildly different experiences if one partner is the trailing spouse without a job and moderate cold feet. It will be way easier for you than for her, so bear that in mind.", "You\u2019re not married and there are no children. You may never have an opportunity like this again and you\u2019d probably have a lifetime of regret if you didn\u2019t go! \nYou just have to ask yourself which you would regret more\u2026leaving your gf or not taking the job. You definitely NTA if you decide to go without her.", "We\u2019ve been together for 5 years. We also bought a house together as an investment and are paying the mortgage each 50%. Plan was to rent out the house when we left for oversees.", "True that. She is of course not allowed to go with me. But does it make me the asshole because I\u2019m the one physically leaving?", "That is the approach I am going with. The fruits of labor haven\u2019t been picked yet. Let\u2019s see. Also love the optimism of when arriving in Belgium", "How about she is the AH because she is going back on their plan to move to Europe?", "Well I disagree. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m the one ditching. You could also view it as she being the one ditching. Because we had the plan and she is now bailing from that plan\u2026", "Both are 28 years old. And we\u2019ve been together for 5 years. And are paying off a mortgage together.", "She was aware that I was applying. However we both thought the chances of getting the job were slim. I\u2019m afraid she was mostly bluffing hoping me getting the job wouldn\u2019t blow her cover", "I'll say NAH, but you could be in for some legal hassles regarding your shared property. Assuming this move ends your relationship, she could similarly try to force a sale of the home to recover her investment, make you to buy out her share, or any other number of scenarios. I've watched a friend go through this exact same thing. I would suggest talking to a lawyer well before you actually move abroad.", "why isn't she allowed to go with you.", "Well time to prep. If you go alone you might get lonely at first before you acclimate. you have to make new friends, learn the culture and stuff like that", "YTA for presuming that she\u2019s just pick up and go to Europe if that was never expressly stated as a concrete goal at any point. Having a mortgage together also sends some wildly mixed signals too if you\u2019ve been serious about this. I agree that you should go if this is really and truly what you want for your career. You\u2019re 28 and these opportunities don\u2019t just appear all the time. But there\u2019s no way you\u2019re escaping being TA here.", "How do you know that this was not an expressly stated concrete goal?\n\nIt seems that this very possibility was discussed when purchasing their house.\n\nThey agreed to rent it out while living in Europe.\n\nSo, there was a backup plan in place for returning to the US at some point.\n\nIt seems that the opportunity could have arisen through OP's job, and it did. \n\nNow, all the GF has to do is follow through with their plans. \n\nOP should not allow the GF to ruin a dream.", "Hence my use of the word \u201cif.\u201d"]}
