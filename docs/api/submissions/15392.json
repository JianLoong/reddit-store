Cindy tried to get her to finish more and more insistently until she said that Amy wouldn't get desert if she didn't finish her entire meal. That's pretty standard and totally fair but when Amy's full, she's full so I'm told she replied with attitude \"I don't want any desert I said I'm full!\"  Cindy got extremely mad at Amy and went on a tirade about respect and wastefulness. She made Amy sit at the table and refused to let her leave until she finished her entire meal. Amy cried at the table for a full hour taking small bites until her food was gone, she didn't end up wanting desert.

I don't think it's possible to over react to this type of situation. Your sister body shamed your child and force fed her through tears for an HOUR! How on EARTH does she know what an appropriate serving is for a 7 year old child?? She clearly doesn't know what healthy weight looks like given that her comments about your daughter's weight are out of touch with reality (as verified by your doctor).\nPersonally? I wouldn't allow her to have unsupervised time with your children for... months at least. She abused your children!!! It doesn't matter that the night ended in an okay or even happy place.

This reminds me of some Mommy Dearest shit. NTA", "NTA. This is how unhealthy relationships with food are developed. Amy is never going to forget this trauma. I was (and still am somewhat) a picky eater. \nWhen I was a child, my mother wanted me to taste something I didn\u2019t want to. She was frustrated and decided no matter what I would taste this food. She chased me and forced it down my throat whilst I was crying. I promptly threw it up and have never ever tried it since. The smell is nauseating to me. I will never try it. Even if someone offered me a million dollars. I simply couldn\u2019t do it. \n\nThis is a core memory for me. I\u2019m willing to bet that this experience is now a core memory for Amy as well.

Do you think it's alright for me to ask for an apology though?", "Forcing people to eat when they're full is literally torture.  You're taking small bites trying not to throw up while feeling extremely nauseous as your stomach is painfully stretched by the volume of food.    \n\nCindy absolutely should change her belief that it is okay for adults to physically torture young children and everyone has the right to demand that she change those beliefs.", "But it\u2019s not wasteful, it\u2019s saved for the later \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\nThe same thing we do with our 6 year old\u2026we give her as little as she needs to sustain herself on her plate and is welcome to have more if she\u2019s hungry.

More often than not she\u2019s refusing to eat because the food might be new or unfamiliar. We do encourage her to at least try a few bites because she\u2019s discovered all kinds of things she wouldn\u2019t have known she likes otherwise.
