My kids frequently visit their aunt 27F, we'll call her Cindy for \"girl's nights.\" My daughters love the visits because they get to be pampered and my SIL doesn't have any kids of her own so she really enjoys the quality time. \r\n\r\nThe kids are well behaved and there are rarely any issues, with the exception of one thing that keeps on getting brought up. Amy is a light eater, always has been and this absolutely infuriates Cindy. \r\n\r\nAs someone who grew up with the \"always clear your plate\" mantra, I know how damaging that can be to someone's relationship with food so if my kids say they're full, then they don't have to eat anymore (for clarity we don't throw food away, just store it for later). \r\n\r\nLast night Amy and Rose had a sleepover at Cindy's. Apparently all was well until dinner. Cindy served the girls what she later told me were the \"proper servings\" of Mac'n'Cheese. Amy decided she was full with about 1/3 of her meal left uneaten. Cindy tried to get her to finish more and more insistently until she said that Amy wouldn't get desert if she didn't finish her entire meal. That's pretty standard and totally fair but when Amy's full, she's full so I'm told she replied with attitude \"I don't want any desert I said I'm full!\"  Cindy got extremely mad at Amy and went on a tirade about respect and wastefulness. She made Amy sit at the table and refused to let her leave until she finished her entire meal. Amy cried at the table for a full hour taking small bites until her food was gone, she didn't end up wanting desert. The entire time my youngest Rose was also crying because she hates to see her sister upset. I heard all of this from Amy and Rose supported the story, though apparently the rest of the night went smoothly and they watched some cartoons and had a mini spa.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard about this I was FURIOUS. Not only did Cindy blatantly disrespect my daughers boundaries, but she body shamed her and forced her to eat while she was BAWLING. She told Amy that she way way too thin and had to get some meat on her bones (her doctor says her weight is perfectly healthy for a girl her age). There has been a repeated problem with Cindy trying to pressure my kids to eat more but this incident was the last straw. \r\n\r\nI'll admit I was probably a bit harsh on Cindy but I'm refusing to let her have the girls over again until she apologizes to Amy, explains to her why forcing her to eat was inappropriate and promises to never repeat it again. Cindy thinks I'm encouraging the girls to be wasteful and ungrateful. \r\n\r\nTLDR My SIL force-fed my kid and body shamed her into eating while my daughter cried.

Who would actually make a kid eat mac n cheese through tears for like an hour? Only a crazy person who is exercising power over children would do that.", "NTA, I would even argue that something like this could be threatening your daughter's health and safety by eating more food than her stomach can physically hold. Her comments about your daughter's weight are also very inappropriate and can be damaging to someone of any age, let alone a 7-year old.", "NTA, this is unbelievable behavior, I would be fucking furious. Fuck her for doing this to your kid. Is she trying to make your kid fat why? because she\u2019s self conscious about her own weight?", "NTA boy did reading this made me furious... \n\nCindy has issues, that she'll need to sort on her own (hopefully with the help of a therapist). But she has absolutely no right to force her problems onto your daughter. What she did could very well have contributed to giving Amy an eating disorder (and no, I am not exaggerating or overreacting, one traumatic experience with food or around the topic of food is enough to root a disorder in the future). \n\nLuckily you advocate for your daughter and I believe you did all the right things to protect her and make sure she knows that Cindy was in the wrong and that the shitty experience of the Mac n' Cheese was that, one shitty experience because of one shitty person. I'm sure she'll be fine. \n\nStand your ground. And honestly, even if Cindy apologizes to Amy, I think she shouldn't be left unsupervised with the kids for a while, until she's proven she can be trusted not to stomp over their boundaries and not to mistreat them.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019ve done everything right - not forcing your kids to eat when they\u2019re full, making sure their weight is healthy, and encouraging good habits in regards to eating and their bodies. Your SIL could do with a reality check on what she perceives as \u201cnormal\u201d portions. \n\nKeep doing good OP.", "NTA. If a kid doesn't want to eat that's fine.  But no snacking later.  Don't finish half your veggies and then come crying to me in an hour that you want ice cream...\n\nIf a kid says she's full, fine.  She's excused from the table.  NO need to start World War III over it.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForce feeding is literally torture.  Your Sister-in-law might as well have been waterboarding her. You're response is very mild. You're giving her a chance to apologize. You're actually willing to let your daughters stay with her again if you're given assurances that this won't be repeated.  This is a very mild reaction.  I would have called the police,  pressed charges for child abuse, and made it clear that under no circumstances would she ever be alone with my kids again.", "NTA. What she did was abuse and it was wrong.", "NTA \n\nIf a kid often says they're full and then is hungry 30 minutes later, I can understand trying to get them to eat more at a sitting. Doesn't sound at all like this is the case with Amy.", "NTA, that's just a bad behavior from her, it's very wrong,  you have all the right to not let her have your kids", "Thank you for standing up for your daughter's boundaries. Stick with it even if it means having less contact with Cindy. If it gets to that point, make sure your girls know why.\n\nNTA", "NTA\u2026this seems to be a common occurrence with Cindy.  If a kid says they\u2019re full, there\u2019s no need to make them sit there and eat every morsel and on top of them tell them they need meat in their bones.  Cindy needs to back off and learn boundaries.  I don\u2019t think you were harsh at all.", "NTA \nI don think you were OTT with your reaction. You are clearly aware of the damage that mindset can have whereas your sister isn't. Stand your ground to protect your daughters. I don't know how anyone could think leaving a child to cry for an hour while they try to force themself to eat food is an okay thing to do.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Cindy needs to learn respect and boundaries. Leaving 1/3 of mac & cheese in the fridge for later is not \u201cwaste\u201d.  If your daughter isn\u2019t hungry, she isn\u2019t hungry. And it\u2019s not up to Cindy to parent her. If the doctor says she\u2019s healthy, it\u2019s not up to Cindy to disagree or force her own beliefs onto this child.", "NTA. If it is a recurring issue and Cindy is not reacting to you request you are absolutely right to limit the contact.  Period. Full stop.  However, I do think that you request that Cindy \"explains to Amy why forcing her to eat was inappropriate\" is wrong. Clearly Cindy does not believe that it is inappropriate and she has a right to her view (she does not have a right to force your kids). It is fair to put conditions on her actions (as in \"never force my kids to eat\"), demanding that she changes her believe is a step too far.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like she isn't a good option to have the girls over, especially for meals.", "NTA\n\nStand your ground. Don\u2019t talk to Cindy AT ALL until she apologizes.", "Um, 1000X NTA!!! I don't think it's possible to over react to this type of situation. Your sister body shamed your child and force fed her through tears for an HOUR! How on EARTH does she know what an appropriate serving is for a 7 year old child?? She clearly doesn't know what healthy weight looks like given that her comments about your daughter's weight are out of touch with reality (as verified by your doctor).\nPersonally? I wouldn't allow her to have unsupervised time with your children for... months at least. She abused your children!!! It doesn't matter that the night ended in an okay or even happy place. Just because your daughters didn't spend the rest of the night sobbing does not negate that they were abused!\n\nhttps://www.spokesman.com/stories/2007/oct/09/force-feeding-is-child-abuse/", "NTA  People like your SIL are why I have issues with my body and weight even now at 64.   Keep doing right by your kids Mom.", "OooooWeeee. Can't post what I would have done to SIL but it would have had me somewhere unpleasant eating bologna sandwiches. My sister and I were forced to eat whatever we were served, whether we liked it or not. I VOWED the day I left home that I would be as picky as I wanted about food and 30 years later I still am. This reminds me of some Mommy Dearest shit. NTA", "NTA. This is how unhealthy relationships with food are developed. Amy is never going to forget this trauma. I was (and still am somewhat) a picky eater. \nWhen I was a child, my mother wanted me to taste something I didn\u2019t want to. She was frustrated and decided no matter what I would taste this food. She chased me and forced it down my throat whilst I was crying. I promptly threw it up and have never ever tried it since. The smell is nauseating to me. I will never try it. Even if someone offered me a million dollars. I simply couldn\u2019t do it. \n\nThis is a core memory for me. I\u2019m willing to bet that this experience is now a core memory for Amy as well. It\u2019s particularly hurtful when someone you love and trust traumatizes you; especially with food. \n\nEven if Cindy apologizes she should have overnights with your girls. And perhaps your should get your daughters some cheap \u201cdumb\u201d phones so if anything like this were to happen again they could call you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to both of your daughters. It was abusive behavior on Cindy\u2019s part. You are most certainly NTA.", "NTA your priority isn't Cindy's feelings it's your daughters wellbeing! Do you think they'd easily forget this encounter & move on? NO! This is exactly how body dysmorphia starts! Protect your child at all cost! Even if they're too young to understand", "NTA", "NTA.  If SIL can\u2019t even fake an apology, she not only believes she\u2019s right, but has every intention of repeating her horrible behavior.", "I don't think so, Cindy has a pretty average weight. I figured she's just mad about the wastefulness and Amy's attitude and \"disrespect.\"", "I wouldn\u2019t leave her alone with my kids again even if she did apologize.", "No not at all, Amy's starting to get really good at knowing how much she needs to keep her energy up an feel good. We're super proud of her!", "Honestly, they didn't seem super freaked out by it, but they haven't really had any time to fully process what happened. Amy seemed more annoyed while she explained it to me, they're young and they bounce back fast. However I do think we'll be taking a break from Cindy until we sort things out.", "I just don't want Amy to get the idea that her aunt's behavior is normal or okay, although I could just have a chat with her myself. Do you think it's alright for me to ask for an apology though?", "Forcing people to eat when they're full is literally torture.  You're taking small bites trying not to throw up while feeling extremely nauseous as your stomach is painfully stretched by the volume of food.    \n\nCindy absolutely should change her belief that it is okay for adults to physically torture young children and everyone has the right to demand that she change those beliefs.", "But it\u2019s not wasteful, it\u2019s saved for the later \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\nThe same thing we do with our 6 year old\u2026we give her as little as she needs to sustain herself on her plate and is welcome to have more if she\u2019s hungry. The expectation is she eats what she\u2019s given when she says it\u2019s gross/yucky/whatever before actually even trying it but if she says she\u2019s full she doesn\u2019t need to eat more. More often than not she\u2019s refusing to eat because the food might be new or unfamiliar. We do encourage her to at least try a few bites because she\u2019s discovered all kinds of things she wouldn\u2019t have known she likes otherwise. Additionally, we always build her plate to include 1-2 items that we know she\u2019s into to help fill her up and buffer whatever else she may not know of or have tried yet. Never once has she been forced to sit at a table for an hour or more to finish her plate. Anything leftover goes in the fridge for her dad or lunch the next day.\n\nI think you did exactly right to your SIL. She was completely off base and damaging!", "Yeah, that's healthy. \"Clean your plate\" is a contributing factor to obesity, IMO.", ">I absolutely do.  Not only it is warranted in this situation, but done correctly it also will reinforce to your kids the importance of taking the responsibility for one's actions.  \n>  \n>Another thing to consider is to have a chat with Cindy about allowing at least Amy to select the size of the portions herselves (Not sure if Rose is old enough - you will now your daughter the best). It will allow them to feel in control, while eliminating Cindy issue (or trigger) of leaving food on the plate.", "You should talk to Amy. Forcing Cindy to deliver what she considers a lie won\u2019t help. And as Amy\u2019s mom, you have much more influence. Amy is even old enough to understand an explanation in age appropriate terms of how you and Cindy were raised, that you think it\u2019s a mistake and that unfortunately Aunt Cindy doesn\u2019t see it that way.", "The SIL should apologise to your daughter. And not a half-assed \"I'm sorry you got upset\" non-apology. She should admit she was wrong and promise to never do that again", "Sorry but I disagree with you.  You seems to use very different definition of  \"full\" than I ever heard of.  People can eat a significant amount of food after feeling \"full\" and not wanting to eat more without any pain.  While I think Cindy was wrong, I think your description overdramatic."]}
