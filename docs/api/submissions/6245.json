It was an accident. Uncle was 30 years old. It was so hard and the family is still mourning. We didn't speak about him much but there is constant feeling that someone is supposed to be here but he isn't.\n\nI was five when uncle M died. I liked him so much. He was smiling all the time, he was funny... In some way he was like my second dad. I have few memories and feeling like something is missing in my life. After all that time I'm still sad. Sometimes it is good but around his birthday, holidays... It's sometimes really terrible.\n\nFew years ago, uncle John got drunk and confessed me he is responsible for uncle M's death. He send him to do the job during he died. I didn't blame him. No one ever blamed him, because it was an accident. We all know it was the accident. Accidents just happens. He blames himself.\n\nFew days ago, after years and years of healthy issues, infertility struggles and few miscarriages uncle John's wife gave birth to a healthy beautiful baby boy. It's like a miracle and we all are so happy for them.\n\nBut... They named the baby M... Like uncle.\n\nI felt like the worst person on the world and total A because I hated it. It's uncle's name. The baby is not M! The baby is constant reminder that uncle M is not here and I don't wanna meet the baby. I cried about it so much.\n\nYesterday my mum called. The whole family is so sad and pissed because of the name. We all think it's awkward. Grandpa don't speak. My dad is so sad. Uncle Paul is pissed. The old wound are open again. Only grandma is happy because uncle John asked her about the name. Of course she said it's OK. She would never tell him no. But uncle John didn't asked grandpa or his brothers (my dad and uncle Paul) how they feel about it. Grandpa would said no.\n\nI'm scared grandma will later realized what this really means and the baby will be the reminder of her late son and she will be so sad and didn't handle it. I'm scared the baby will feel excluded because we will not able to look at him and don't think about uncle. It will be of course unconsciously. But still. I don't wanna hurt the baby.\n\nSo can we asked uncle John to think about to change his baby name or we will be TA? They could gave the name M as middle name...\n\nEDIT:   \n\nThank you for all your comments and please trust me I'm feeling like TA since day one when I was feeling sadness instead of happiness of new member of our family. I never wanted to hurt anyone. I just looking for some way to handle this situation and I'm doing it wrong way. So no asking about the change of name. Really bad idea and I didn't see it because I was so focused on my feelings.\n\nThank you for helping me realize this is not just sadness and mourning but it's more like unsolved trauma. I will talk to my therapist as soon as possible. I never realized this could be so big problem. I always though I'm just sad, because I miss my beloved uncle. I'll take some time to get myself up and try to talk with my family, so the baby can feel welcomed and loved.", "created_utc": 1672603418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100rzut/wibta_for_telling_my_uncle_he_should_change_his/", "score": 379, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It very much reminds me of the way my grandmother used to grieve\u2014for everyone. She would often bring up old wounds to feel them again. I think she thought that if she didn\u2019t, she\u2019d forget them. It was exhausting. \n\nMy mother talks about the way she view death often.

To talk about your loved ones without becoming broken in sadness and grief. For instance, my mother in law was wonderful. She was killed in an motorcycle accident 18 years ago. I can now bring her up with my husband and laugh. I had laser on my face yesterday and was laughing that this is what I\u2019d get her for Christmas if she were still here and she\u2019d be SO into it. This is the same with my dad\u2019s memory. He died horribly in 2020, and sometimes that catches me by surprise\u2014the death is still very close, but I can still remember him and laugh. We were looking at BBQ\u2019s the other day and I could hear his voice in my head saying, \u201cShoot! That\u2019s a nice piece of machinery!\u201d \n\nThis baby was named in honor of your uncle. It is a new soul that will live many many years. He will be different. Remember you uncle with fondness and tell your new cousin the tales of his life.", "Oh so much YTA.

Again, not your tradition, but I would think other people also do it sometimes. I\u2019m having trouble seeing what your uncle did as traumatic or insulting and apparently so do other posters.\n\nAnd I agree with all the people who are suggesting therapy for everyone.

Also maybe going on a visit to talk with psychologist wouldn't hurt, because yes, losing a loved one is hard.", "NAH. Seems like Uncle J has a lot of lingering guilt over the tragic accident. And people give their babies names to honor other people all the time. I don't think he's an AH for wanting to do this. But I can see your family's POV that it's a constant reminder of him. Even though my stance is generally that it's better to confront your grief and honor people's memories than to shut down and just not talk about them... everyone is different, and your aging grandparents just not wanting to hear the name all the time makes perfect sense. Although it sounds like your grandma doesn't mind it, and I don't really know what you mean by her eventually realizing what the name \"really means\".\n\nHaving a family sit down and gently bringing up these points and suggesting it be a middle name instead seems like a sensible thing to do. Just keep in mind that it's still within his rights to turn you guys down and name the kid what he wants, so it might turn into a sticky situation.\n\nUltimately it's important to make sure that the kid isn't alienated by the family for the name he didn't choose, though. Regardless of what your uncle does, don't stoop so low as to ignore the poor thing. Even if the name brings you guys grief, that's on Uncle J, and the family will be the AHs if the kid feels excluded because you all won't interact with him.", "YTA in this situation. This is his way of honouring his brother. \n\nI do however sympathise with your grief, perhaps see someone about it so you can process it better", "Yta", "YTA your uncle has every right to name his son after whoever he wishes. He asked his  mother gave him permission and he doesn't need yours", "NAH. I think both your point of view are okey since you all had a relation with M and didn't all reacted the same way. The name has a meaning for all of you, a good one because you knew M but a poor one too because you still miss him a lot. \n\nThat being said I am pretty sure it's not a good idea to give the name of the man you think you killed to your kid. It's very sad, heavy for the child and it seems like John did a penance rather than a honor. I mean it's already hard to be named after a relative but this baby will be named after the man his father thinks he killed. That's just not okay. It's just like Lady Di, both of her sons gave her name as a SECOND name to their daughters to avoid having them carrying the image of Lady Diana.  \n\nYou all need family therapy to learn to deal with it.", "Ok, there's a hella lot of grief still being dealt and processed by the entire family. But here is where my opinion differs from the majority. I understand where Uncle John feels he is honoring his late brother, but I believe that in this particular case, his son should definitely NOT have M's name as a first name. \n\nA middle name absolutely, but one, the baby shouldn't be burdened with carrying such a legacy of still profound grief from within your family. Two, while M's death was said to be an accident multiple times by OP, it's a bit clear that the family holds John responsible subconsciously for it. John himself held with that belief that he was responsible for his brothers death. While this has been stated as being completely untrue, feelings are rarely logical, and grief is often expressed by anger and blame.\n\nIn this particular family, the naming of the baby after his deceased uncle is causing intense pain and anguish to the others. A baby joining the family should be one of happiness and celebration, not strife and a recurrence of grief. \n\nNAH.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My brother and only sibling died when he was 20 (I was about to turn 23). It was excruciating. It really crushed my family. For years I could not bring myself to say his name, it was too painful. Then I got pregnant with my firstborn (a girl). We were trying to figure out names when I saw a friend of mine at a party and she was like, \u201cso her name is totally gonna be (brother\u2019s nickname), right?\u201d My brother had a nickname that he went by since he was a child. People often assumed it was his legal name. It is commonly used for both men and women, but he had a unique spelling. The last time I spoke to my brother, he made me promise that if anything ever happened to him and he didn\u2019t have a son, that I would name one of my sons after him (he was in the military.) His official name is also a unique and long name. \n\nThe more I thought about it, the more it felt right to name her after him using his nickname (I had fertility issues and figured this might be our only child). I still could not bring myself to say the name before she was born and we kept it a secret from the family. When she was born, we gave her my brother\u2019s nickname, and she has grown to really embody her name. She wears it well, but it is her name, not his, and it didn\u2019t take me long to call her by her name without the pain of associating it with my late brother. My family found it a touching tribute to him.\n\nMy daughter knows who she was named after. Sometimes she draws me pictures of me and my brother when we were kids (she\u2019s 4). It\u2019s the very best. I\u2019m really glad we chose to honor him by giving her his nickname. He would be proud of her creativity. They are very similar, but we put no pressure on her to be like him. She is her own person with her own hopes and dreams, and I don\u2019t ever want to stifle that.\n\nBut I do understand you and your family and the weirdness of it and to not be ready to hear the name of someone who\u2019s memory is so painful. My mother\u2019s family is Jewish and their common condolence when someone dies is, \u201cMay their memory be a blessing.\u201d For a long time my brother\u2019s memory was not a blessing. It was just painful. Now it is a blessing and I credit that to my daughter. It\u2019s been very healing.\n\nYour family has been through and is going through a lot. You all will love this child. Unconditionally. I\u2019ll admit that it may take a little time to get used to calling someone else in your family the name of Uncle M, but that baby will be his own M, and your heart will be able to embrace that joy and pain simultaneously. Humans are complicated and so are our emotions. Sometimes complicated can be good. Try to embrace the good. I wish you all much healing and lots of baby snuggles and kisses.", "I\u2019m going to give a soft YTA because it sounds like OPs family has not healed from this death and OP I think you and your family really need to move forward in the healing process and maybe seek help with it , this doesn\u2019t seem like the normal reaction from a family when someone chooses to honor a loved one", "Gentle YTA.  I understand that you're hurting, but your uncle has named the baby after M to honor his memory, and asking him to change the baby's name would be presumptuous and wrong.
