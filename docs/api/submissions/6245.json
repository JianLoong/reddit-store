It was an accident. Uncle was 30 years old. It was so hard and the family is still mourning. We didn't speak about him much but there is constant feeling that someone is supposed to be here but he isn't.\n\nI was five when uncle M died. I liked him so much. He was smiling all the time, he was funny... In some way he was like my second dad. I have few memories and feeling like something is missing in my life. After all that time I'm still sad. Sometimes it is good but around his birthday, holidays... It's sometimes really terrible.\n\nFew years ago, uncle John got drunk and confessed me he is responsible for uncle M's death. He send him to do the job during he died. I didn't blame him. No one ever blamed him, because it was an accident. We all know it was the accident. Accidents just happens. He blames himself.\n\nFew days ago, after years and years of healthy issues, infertility struggles and few miscarriages uncle John's wife gave birth to a healthy beautiful baby boy. It's like a miracle and we all are so happy for them.\n\nBut... They named the baby M... Like uncle.\n\nI felt like the worst person on the world and total A because I hated it. It's uncle's name. The baby is not M! The baby is constant reminder that uncle M is not here and I don't wanna meet the baby. I cried about it so much.\n\nYesterday my mum called. The whole family is so sad and pissed because of the name. We all think it's awkward. Grandpa don't speak. My dad is so sad. Uncle Paul is pissed. The old wound are open again. Only grandma is happy because uncle John asked her about the name. Of course she said it's OK. She would never tell him no. But uncle John didn't asked grandpa or his brothers (my dad and uncle Paul) how they feel about it. Grandpa would said no.\n\nI'm scared grandma will later realized what this really means and the baby will be the reminder of her late son and she will be so sad and didn't handle it. I'm scared the baby will feel excluded because we will not able to look at him and don't think about uncle. It will be of course unconsciously. But still. I don't wanna hurt the baby.\n\nSo can we asked uncle John to think about to change his baby name or we will be TA? They could gave the name M as middle name...\n\nEDIT:   \n\nThank you for all your comments and please trust me I'm feeling like TA since day one when I was feeling sadness instead of happiness of new member of our family. I never wanted to hurt anyone. I just looking for some way to handle this situation and I'm doing it wrong way. So no asking about the change of name. Really bad idea and I didn't see it because I was so focused on my feelings.\n\nThank you for helping me realize this is not just sadness and mourning but it's more like unsolved trauma. I will talk to my therapist as soon as possible. I never realized this could be so big problem. I always though I'm just sad, because I miss my beloved uncle. I'll take some time to get myself up and try to talk with my family, so the baby can feel welcomed and loved.", "created_utc": 1672603418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100rzut/wibta_for_telling_my_uncle_he_should_change_his/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It very much reminds me of the way my grandmother used to grieve\u2014for everyone. She would often bring up old wounds to feel them again. I think she thought that if she didn\u2019t, she\u2019d forget them. It was exhausting. \n\nMy mother talks about the way she view death often. She used to tell me as a child that dredging up the day and focusing on the death was no way to remember the person who lived many, many days and not just the day of their death. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to move on. To talk about your loved ones without becoming broken in sadness and grief. For instance, my mother in law was wonderful. She was killed in an motorcycle accident 18 years ago. I can now bring her up with my husband and laugh. I had laser on my face yesterday and was laughing that this is what I\u2019d get her for Christmas if she were still here and she\u2019d be SO into it. This is the same with my dad\u2019s memory. He died horribly in 2020, and sometimes that catches me by surprise\u2014the death is still very close, but I can still remember him and laugh. We were looking at BBQ\u2019s the other day and I could hear his voice in my head saying, \u201cShoot! That\u2019s a nice piece of machinery!\u201d \n\nThis baby was named in honor of your uncle. It is a new soul that will live many many years. He will be different. Remember you uncle with fondness and tell your new cousin the tales of his life.", "Oh so much YTA.

I mean, at some point, life moves on. He\u2019s not here and that\u2019s tragic, he should be here, but he isn\u2019t.

Again, not your tradition, but I would think other people also do it sometimes. I\u2019m having trouble seeing what your uncle did as traumatic or insulting and apparently so do other posters.\n\nAnd I agree with all the people who are suggesting therapy for everyone.

I suggest you all look into grief counselling, quickly.", "Wtf\n\nDefinitely YTA. You and the entire family. First, he named his child after his brother because he loves and cherishes his brother. And second, it\u2019s not your business what he names his child. How would you like it if you named your child after a relative who died and the entire family got upset with you and tried to force you to change their name???", "Oof you\u2019re absolutely TA, losing a family member is hard but naming a child after them is a great way to honor them.", "YTA - a named tribute from someone who died 25 years ago is impacting you this much?

Adding onto that I think I'd be happy when my mother, dad or an other family members died and my brother would call his son/daughter their names in honor. Also maybe going on a visit to talk with psychologist wouldn't hurt, because yes, losing a loved one is hard.", "NAH. Seems like Uncle J has a lot of lingering guilt over the tragic accident. And people give their babies names to honor other people all the time. I don't think he's an AH for wanting to do this. But I can see your family's POV that it's a constant reminder of him. Even though my stance is generally that it's better to confront your grief and honor people's memories than to shut down and just not talk about them... everyone is different, and your aging grandparents just not wanting to hear the name all the time makes perfect sense. Although it sounds like your grandma doesn't mind it, and I don't really know what you mean by her eventually realizing what the name \"really means\".\n\nHaving a family sit down and gently bringing up these points and suggesting it be a middle name instead seems like a sensible thing to do. Just keep in mind that it's still within his rights to turn you guys down and name the kid what he wants, so it might turn into a sticky situation.\n\nUltimately it's important to make sure that the kid isn't alienated by the family for the name he didn't choose, though. Regardless of what your uncle does, don't stoop so low as to ignore the poor thing. Even if the name brings you guys grief, that's on Uncle J, and the family will be the AHs if the kid feels excluded because you all won't interact with him.", "YTA in this situation. This is his way of honouring his brother. \n\nI do however sympathise with your grief, perhaps see someone about it so you can process it better", "Yta", "YTA your uncle has every right to name his son after whoever he wishes. He asked his  mother gave him permission and he doesn't need yours", "NAH. I think both your point of view are okey since you all had a relation with M and didn't all reacted the same way. The name has a meaning for all of you, a good one because you knew M but a poor one too because you still miss him a lot. \n\nThat being said I am pretty sure it's not a good idea to give the name of the man you think you killed to your kid. It's very sad, heavy for the child and it seems like John did a penance rather than a honor. I mean it's already hard to be named after a relative but this baby will be named after the man his father thinks he killed. That's just not okay. It's just like Lady Di, both of her sons gave her name as a SECOND name to their daughters to avoid having them carrying the image of Lady Diana.  \n\nYou all need family therapy to learn to deal with it.", "Ok, there's a hella lot of grief still being dealt and processed by the entire family. But here is where my opinion differs from the majority. I understand where Uncle John feels he is honoring his late brother, but I believe that in this particular case, his son should definitely NOT have M's name as a first name. \n\nA middle name absolutely, but one, the baby shouldn't be burdened with carrying such a legacy of still profound grief from within your family. Two, while M's death was said to be an accident multiple times by OP, it's a bit clear that the family holds John responsible subconsciously for it. John himself held with that belief that he was responsible for his brothers death. While this has been stated as being completely untrue, feelings are rarely logical, and grief is often expressed by anger and blame.\n\nIn this particular family, the naming of the baby after his deceased uncle is causing intense pain and anguish to the others. A baby joining the family should be one of happiness and celebration, not strife and a recurrence of grief. \n\nNAH.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's doing it to honour his brother and you all need to respect his reasons for doing so.", "YTA. \n\nBig time. \n\nSeek therapy, dude. \n\nYour uncle has every right to name his child after the brother he lost.", "NAH and i'm super confused by all the YTAs. Look up any other post on here about someone naming a baby after a dead sibling and there's tons of people saying YTA for doing it. So idk why suddenly everyone's good with it in this case.", "It's super odd how possessive OP is over his uncle's name instead of considering how if M made that big of an impact in 5 yrs that he likely made an even bigger one on his actual brothers who knew each other their whole lives.", "Yeah it is really weird how possessive OP is over an uncle they hardly know. They were 5 when he passed and the average human only starts forming more permanent memories at 3 so that's only really 2 years worth of memories and even then it's only probably a handful since it was so long ago and these are early memories. \n\nThey didn't really know their uncle at all compared to his actual brothers who spent a their lives with their brother since their childhood.", "My son is named after his uncle who passed away, my brother is named after one uncle who passed away and I have multiple cousins named after another uncle that passed away. That seems like a normal thing for someone to do to honor a relative.", "This is also a common thing for people who have lost a sibling to do.", "But OP, who was 5 when M died, is the biggest AH of all.", "[deleted]", "Imagine lecturing someone who was an adult during the tragedy and had known M his entire life when M died, like OP wasn't just exiting toddlerhood at the time. Like it's his actual brother, OP absolutely needs to back off.", "Pretty sure M is the first name, they were just suggesting changing it to the baby's middle name as a  compromise.\n\n>So can we asked uncle John to think about to change his baby name or we will be TA? They could gave the name M as middle name...", "People say this but people have been named after the dead since time immemorial and this is rarely a problem. I\u2019ve never been told \u201cI wish you were like your grandad you\u2019re named after\u201d heck nobody even tells me about him and I have his name.", "My children are both named after my late parents, and my nephew is named after my grandfather. Nobody, absolutely nobody, was surprised. OPs family is very weird.", "My husband\u2019s grandfather was named for his older deceased\u2026. sister.  That gives some My Sweet Audrina vibes, but whatever.", "My middle name was to honor my grandma. She wasn't even close to death's door when I was born and named but my mom loved her mom so much and wanted to honor her in some way anyways.", "\\*Raises both hands\\* I'm named after both my late maternal great-aunts, OP and their family are being Really Weird about this.", "YTA.   Why do you have to make everything about you ?   You don\u2019t remember him.  Get over yourself and let the people who knew him get on with their lives.", "This comment was the best. OP is very entitled for thinking they have the right to dictate whether or not the brother of the guy who passed away should name their child after him or not when they were just 5 when said guy died, this is very weird.", "OMG in that case, absolutely.", "No, but living in the past ain't helping them or yourself either", "If it was my brother and something had happened, then literally no one in this entire world would tell me how I was to grieve and where I could use his name!", "And no one said I was. But pretending my brother isn\u2019t /wasn\u2019t special to me, and forsaking what his name means is what \u201cheal and move on\u201d implies. \n\nTo do so is disrespectful.", "Especially someone who was 5 at the time and barely remembers the dead brother in opposite as me who has known him for my whole life", "This is psychotic. I was named after my grandmother. She died 5 years ago. Do I need to change my name so it's not a reminder of her?\n\nI was named after her because she was loved and appreciated by my parents. That name is now my own and reflects my own life, too.\n\nThe fact you can't get over something that happened THERE DECADES AGO isn't normal. The idea that naming a child is \"forsaking\" your brother or \"disrespectful\" is insane.\n\nPeople choose a name because it has meaning. Maybe that meaning is as simple as they like the sound. Maybe it has a definition or story they like. Or maybe it was the name of someone they loved or respected. These are all valid reasons to choose a name. They are not disrespectful."]}
