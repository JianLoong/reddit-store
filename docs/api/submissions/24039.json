Your sisters reasoning is absurd and I understand your dismissal of it, but you\u2019re still wrong for scheduling like you did. There\u2019s going to be tons of common guests at your weddings, which means a bunch of people are going to be paying for and dealing with being in two wedding parties, buying two gifts, taking several days off of work for events for two weddings, buying two or more outfits, etcetera.

It is rude, but ultimately it's only to your disadvantage. Your family isn't going to be able to give you much a month after your sister's wedding.", "YTA. So, you knew her date was in April, so you purposely picked a month later? Yeah, that's kinda dirty. Especially to expect family to all come to another wedding so soon.", "I think yta. Your guests will be almost identical, can they afford to go to two weddings in close proximity? Most families can't, I'd have moved yours to the year after hers. It's only a year, barely matters.", "YTA for deliberately choosing a date a month later.  I guess there is a lot of competition between you and your sister.  This will also cause huge problems for guests.  But you don't care about anyone it seems.", "YTA. Not because of the newlywed thing, but because you are putting your family through the pressure and expense of having two weddings so close together.

I recommend looking at possibly changing your venue date closer to late summer, or early fall when the weather isn't too bad if you're looking to host it outside.

Thats definitely a factor for considering moving the weddings further apart.", "The comments seem rather balanced and I think for good reason. I'm going to go with each of you are a bit in the wrong here, but for different reasons. \n\nYour wedding is YOUR wedding. You get to do whatever you want with it as long as your partner is onboard and you both are willing to accept the consequences of your choices. If this is the only day and time you could ever see yourself getting married, then thats your answer.

Even simple ones are like yikes. I got married in Vegas and we kept it so basic and simple it was great, but also it wasn't nothing. It's a lot of coordination with folks. \n\nI'd say ONLY because of your sister's main concern, and not many details, you are NTA.\n\nAlso, I think it's you that has an anniversary date for the rest of your life, and maybe you want a spring date, and not a fall one. It's your life, nobody else has your wedding anniversary date, you do and your spouse.", "NTA. If you had scheduled yours to occur before hers, then you would be the AH.

It\u2019s not really about the sisters feelings, its more about the family for me.

People who live far enough away that they'll need to spend the night?\n- do you have a lot of overlapping guests?\n- are the weddings on Saturdays?\n- are kids invited?\n- are your parents paying for the wedding?\n\nIf you're asking a lot of people to travel twice in a month, many people realistically can't afford to travel twice that closely. Especially if they need to take time off, find babysitters, and arrange travel. This could lead to a lot of guests not coming or having to pick just one wedding.\n\nSo a wedding on a Saturday where everyone is local and kids are invited? You're good.

If the invitations are sent with lots of time ahead, why would it be a problem if people can plan financially for attending both weddings in advance? Also, it is a whole month later, not one week, I assume people will have received their paycheck by them. \n\nAlso, I had six weddings to attend last year, and some were really close to each other.
