And that I would rather want to do stuff like going eat nice food, escaperooms/climbing/wellness, \u2026 whatever - just have a nice time with my friends, enjoying ourselves. \n\nWell a week ago my bachelorette party started and I got handed a vendors tray from Jill, a shirt that said \"bride\" and a crown that said bride too. \ni thanked her for the crown and the shirt but told her thank you for the tray and that it was a good joke but now she should put it away. \nshe insisted it wasnt a joke and i should just wear it as it is a tradition. \nwe argued for 45 minutes (yes thats sad) until she left that stupid tray and we went to grab a bite and mocktails in a restaurant. \nwhen we wanted to ordet she handed me a bingo card - but instead of numbers there were tasks to fullfill like \"kiss a stranger\" and stuff. \n\ni handed it back and told her if she didnt stop i would go home. after a few minutes she asked if i dont want to give the games a try so i payed for my drink and left. \n\nthen i organized a girls night for yesterday. Starting with an escape room, nice foods, lots of talking and games we all love and wellness (doing face masks, painting pur nails,\u2026) in a hotel suite with my friends. \njill refused to come and called me an AH for leaving the party she planned and organizing my own.", "created_utc": 1681929381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s5s2b/aita_for_organising_my_own_bachelorette_party/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like Jill planned the bachelorette party SHE wanted and completely ignored your wishes.", "NTA she planned what she wanted you to do not what you wanted", "NTA. You set very reasonable boundaries for what YOU wanted for YOUR bachelorette party and she disrespected them. You told her that you would leave if she didn\u2019t quit and when she didn\u2019t, you followed through. She should honestly be grateful that she was even invited to the bachelorette party that you planned and hosted.", "NTA - You did the exact right thing.    I used to have a friend like this..... used to - this gets worse, I swear that woman could make anything situation about her, always going all out no matter how someone told her not to then getting explosively angry when she didn't get her way.   She once old me \"when I turn 40, you b\\*tches better f\\*cking take me to Hawaii for 2 weeks or else\".", "NTA, sounds like she planned a Bachelorette party for herself.", "NTA\n\nA bachelorette party shouldn't be uncomfortable. I've personally never really understood the \"last night of freedom, so I'm going to act a fool\", but to each their own. Anyway, sounds like you wanted something very different, expressed that prior, and she still planned what she wanted to plan.", "NTA Jill planned a party she wanted not what you wanted", "NTA- you stated you weren't comfortable with these things, an told her what you were comfortable with. She didn't listen to what YOU the BRIDE wanted. \n\nShe should've known better, let her be upset. Cause I'd be pissed if someone did everything exactly opposite to my comfortability for my own party.", "NTA but Jill is.  Are you sure she's a friend, because she did everything you asked her not to.  Is she jealous?   Wow..... yeah no, good for you for standing up for yourself and then doing what you want!", "NTA, you set your boundaries at the start, your friend should have listened to you. It sounds to me like she wanted the night to go her way and not to be about you!", "NTA. What you did sounds amazing. You gave her a list of no's and she apparently took that as \"please do these things\", lol. What in the actual hell?", "NTA. You told her you wanted an escape room--she shouldn't blame you for escaping!", "NTA, Jill seems like those people \"who know better what you want\"", "NTA.\n\nSounds like she didn't listen to anything you said and just organized a party for herself.", "NTA\u2026. You told her what you were comfortable with and she ignored you.", "NTA\n\nYou stated what you wanted and they should have respected that.", "NTA - Jill is", "NTA - she didn\u2019t listen or respect your boundaries.", "nta, it sounds like she threw herself the party", "NTA \n\nShe refused to plan something that you would enjoy.
