And that I would rather want to do stuff like going eat nice food, escaperooms/climbing/wellness, \u2026 whatever - just have a nice time with my friends, enjoying ourselves. \n\nWell a week ago my bachelorette party started and I got handed a vendors tray from Jill, a shirt that said \"bride\" and a crown that said bride too. \ni thanked her for the crown and the shirt but told her thank you for the tray and that it was a good joke but now she should put it away. \nshe insisted it wasnt a joke and i should just wear it as it is a tradition. \nwe argued for 45 minutes (yes thats sad) until she left that stupid tray and we went to grab a bite and mocktails in a restaurant. \nwhen we wanted to ordet she handed me a bingo card - but instead of numbers there were tasks to fullfill like \"kiss a stranger\" and stuff. \n\ni handed it back and told her if she didnt stop i would go home. after a few minutes she asked if i dont want to give the games a try so i payed for my drink and left. \n\nthen i organized a girls night for yesterday. Starting with an escape room, nice foods, lots of talking and games we all love and wellness (doing face masks, painting pur nails,\u2026) in a hotel suite with my friends. \njill refused to come and called me an AH for leaving the party she planned and organizing my own.", "created_utc": 1681929381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s5s2b/aita_for_organising_my_own_bachelorette_party/", "score": 655, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You set very reasonable boundaries for what YOU wanted for YOUR bachelorette party and she disrespected them.

She should honestly be grateful that she was even invited to the bachelorette party that you planned and hosted.", "NTA - You did the exact right thing.    I used to have a friend like this..... used to - this gets worse, I swear that woman could make anything situation about her, always going all out no matter how someone told her not to then getting explosively angry when she didn't get her way.

Wow..... yeah no, good for you for standing up for yourself and then doing what you want!", "NTA, you set your boundaries at the start, your friend should have listened to you. It sounds to me like she wanted the night to go her way and not to be about you!", "NTA. What you did sounds amazing. You gave her a list of no's and she apparently took that as \"please do these things\", lol. What in the actual hell?", "NTA. You told her you wanted an escape room--she shouldn't blame you for escaping!", "NTA, Jill seems like those people \"who know better what you want\"", "NTA.\n\nSounds like she didn't listen to anything you said and just organized a party for herself.", "NTA\u2026.

I was prepared to say otherwise based on the title but she literally ignored your wishes.

She threw a fit, cussed everyone out going on an on about how she does all this and that for everyone but when her day comes we all just don't care.   It's a massive emotional upheaval.    After this last time a year ago April 8th 2022, I blocked her number.   I just had to move the heck out of crazy town.", "NTA.\n\nI planned the bachelorette party for one of my friends (her wedding is next weekend!). I asked the other bridesmaids what the bride would like to do (I wasn\u2019t 100% sure), then I made sure everyone could make it on the agreed date. It got stressful at times because I didn\u2019t want to mess up, but the bride-to-be had fun, which was the entire point of her bachelorette party.\n\nYou told \u201cJill\u201d specifically what you didn\u2019t want and she went ahead and did it anyway.

You should have the party you want, not what she wanted. Many of those \"traditions\" are mean, offensive and/or embarrassing. OP, if you don't want to do any of those things, no reason to do them or tolerate her pushing them.", "NTA\n\nJill refusing to come is a win.", "NTA and I hardly think you can say she \"planned\" a party. It's not planning to use every lame \"bachlorette go to\" at a bar and print out a card. So you planned a party you liked and got to know a little something about how crappy of a friend Jill is.", "NTA, she organized what she wanted for HER enjoyment, not YOUR enjoyment.", "Nope, you gave her some boundaries and she ignored them. The Bachelorette/bachelor party is supposed to be fun for the groom/bride and Friends, not for just one person. \n\nAlso congratulations!", "It sounds like she offered less out of friendship and more because she thought she would get something out of it such as getting to do all of the \"fun stuff\" (it doesn't sound fun to me either) but when you said you didn't want to she thought she could bully you into it and you would just accept it. Unfortunately, I do know people who do not like confrontation and would just accept it because they didn't want to \"make a scene\" but instead you (proud of you) stood up for yourself.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Sounds like my kind of party!", "My MIL planned my bachelorette party. There was my mom and sister then the rest was her side of the family because I had nobody else who lived around us. One of the games was to make a wedding dress out of toilet paper. There were some other games but I can\u2019t remember them because it was almost 25 years ago. But it was actual fun stuff. No last night of freedom bull either. My MIL was quite a bit older than me so her ideas would have been from around her time. I didn\u2019t mind because it was actually fun. It was more like celebrating your last night of freedom instead of going wild/last chance to do stupid shit. I think this was the style poor OP had in mind but with modern games.", "That sounds a lot like you accidentally had fun doing something that sounded boring. And that can sometimes be nice because the chances you'll ever do it again are slim, so the memory sticks.", "I gate crashed a bachelorette my mum hosted when I was 8. She was a single mum, and I could hear all the laughter downstairs and wanted to join into. They let me do the toilet paper bride game with them, but then I had to leave and go back to bed so they could play the adult games. I got to keep the toilets paper bouquet though.\n\nNTA, bachelorette parties are more about female bonding than last night of freedom in my opinion and I definitely would have enjoyed OPs version more than the one Jill planned. Plus drinking in a hotel suite is more fun and relaxing because you don't have to worry about creepy guys leering at you.", "No I\u2019m just a weird person and like things that those in my age group wouldn\u2019t ever do.", "Well that's fair, too.", "NTA  You communicated what you didn't want and what you did want and she chose to do it her way anyway.   Let her go.", "NTA. Her goal was to embarrass you and make you uncomfortable. You stated your preferences beforehand, and held up your boundaries when she stomped on them. She repeatedly badgered you in an effort to wear you down. This bachelorette party wasn't for you, it was for her own amusement.", "NTA", "NTA.

We were roughly 25 at the time. We went to Drive A Tank and spent time running around in APCs and he crushed a car with a bigger tank. Then we went to the bar up the road from his house and had a few beers. Obviously very different than yours, but also nothing he couldn't show pics of to his wife."]}
