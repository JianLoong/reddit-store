She is a kid just learning. Anxiety is rough when you're first learning something. Tell your brother that you're sorry you upset her and maybe offer to draw with her one day. Lesson one is never to offer unsolicited advice, even if you think it would help them. And if you do have the need, word it gently for someone younger as they might not have learned those techniques yet. Maybe word it like: \"Wow, that looks great! Hey Niece, I, too, am somewhat an artist. Do you want me to show you some tips and tricks?\"", "Based on the information provided, your intentions to teach and guide your niece in improving her drawings were well-intentioned. As an individual with expertise in art, you noticed a particular aspect that could be improved, specifically shading, and you offered guidance to help her understand and apply the concept.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider the emotional impact of your feedback on a young and developing artist. While your intentions may have been positive, it appears that your niece felt insecure and frustrated, resulting in her tearing up her drawings and becoming upset. It is important to recognize that criticism, even when constructive, can have varying effects on individuals, especially children.\n\nIn this scenario, the question of whether you are the asshole (TA) or not the asshole (NTA) depends on how you approached the situation and delivered your feedback. If you provided constructive criticism in a supportive and gentle manner, emphasizing the room for improvement while also acknowledging the strengths of her drawings, you could be considered NTA.\n\nHowever, if your feedback was delivered without sensitivity and caused significant distress to your niece, then you would be deemed TA. It is crucial to balance constructive feedback with empathy and encouragement, particularly when dealing with young artists who may be more vulnerable to feelings of self-doubt.\n\nIn conclusion, the determination of whether you are the asshole (TA) or not the asshole (NTA) depends on the manner in which you provided feedback to your niece. Ensuring that your guidance is delivered with sensitivity and compassion is essential in nurturing her artistic growth and preserving her confidence.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But maybe use compliment sandwiches when constructively critiquing her art from now on. Or, if you have the spare time and energy and are inclined to do so, you might help her to receive the criticism in the encouraging and helpful spirit in which it was intended by sitting down to demonstrate the techniques you're telling her about and maybe even drawing together a bit so she can learn by watching you rather than just trying it out on her own and feeling disappointed/frustrated by her efforts. \n\nLike, I remember being really insecure in my talents at that age and a lot of other people I knew also were (and just insecure in general), and it obviously isn't your fault that she's a preteen but it'd be a pretty easy thing to accommodate and work around moving forward.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA as an artist myself and I\u2019d say I\u2019m pretty good having been an artist pretty much all my life.. I WISH I had someone to teach me about shading when I first started. It took a long time before I learned correct shading. Being an artist and being passionate about it can lead to frustrations I\u2019ve ripped up MANY drawings as a kid and it had NOTHING to do with anyone saying anything to me. It\u2019s a learning process and anger is definitely a common reaction when learning about something your passionate about.. alot in art, can\u2019t get the perfect shading = equals lots of frustration. Same goes with color, shape, lines ect..\nHas anyone asked her if what you said upset her? \nI know this child isn\u2019t \u201cevery artist\u201d so no one can speak for her\u2026 so has anyone asked what she thought? If she appreciated the advice? Me PERSONALLY, at that age would have worked just as hard to perfect it if someone gave me that advice. In the future definitely ask if she wants advice on how to improve, I can guarantee if she said yes \n, or even if she asked you herself, the same reaction would have occurred", "My dad did that to me when I was younger and it did make me extremely frustrated that I couldn't figure it out and got no assistance I learning how to shadow even when I chose a light source\n\nNta- maybe show her with you drawing the shading or finding a way to teach about shadows, it seems trivial and dumb as adults but as kids trying to make something look nice and make sense feels good when we learn.", "NTA\n\n\nHer acting like a teenager is not your fault. She got frustrated and made a mistake. Shit happens. Let her cry it out.", "NTA", "This is a Reddit where I\u2019m not too sure if you are or not be a-hole when you\u2019re starting to draw and are younger, you may not know all the techniques of how to make the art realistic or looking like the real thing, but I think it\u2019s great. How are you showed her? what she could improve on, but maybe you should\u2019ve been with her like sit down and showed her how to do it I guess it\u2019s not really your fault that she got upset about not knowing how to do it, but maybe to allow that to happen you should\u2019ve showed her in person how to do it correct but also then again she is 12 years old it doesn\u2019t really matter too much on accuracy.", "I don't know.  I would have loved a tutor at that age. \n\nBut it really depends on whether your help was sought or pushed, and whether it was addressed at an appropriate level.", "NTA You were simply trying to teach her some basics. She would have found that out anyway if she were to actualy take a course on drawing one day if she is that passionate. The thing with criticizim though is that you have to coat it pretty well in sugar, like 95-99% sugar and then add the thing you need to say. It usually depends on the person how well they take it or how much they apreciate the input, but with a kid it's unpredictable. Your brothers reaction and anger are very misplaced. He could have used the incident to teach her about emotional restraint and not making harsh decisions out of impluse. Instead of ripping up the drawings or correcting them, she could try to recreate them with the new knowledge and then study the differences and see for herself the progress in time. Also maybe it's ok to tell her that many artists end up destroying their own work for different reasons, if she really wants to do that it's ok, but the best approach would still be the one where you keep the art and then in time it will make you feel better to see the progress. It's only normal to get better and better in time, but that does not mean you should destroy older art which you might now see lacks different things. It's like photographs, you don't get rid of the one's when you were a baby just because you're getting older.", "NTA\n\nGiven her drastic reaction, I would assume it\u2019s one of the first time Emily heard constructive criticism. I would offer to teach her but don\u2019t feel bad about it.", "NTA with cautionary opinions. Emily is definitely an artist, but she hasn't realized that you don't have to change something you already did. You can make something new. There might be an OCD leaning in there, too. But if you can, talk with your brother, and tell him you'd like to explain about that to Emily. Run the explanation by him first, along with profound apologies for having set this off. Accident, yes, I know, but it's a kindness to Emily and she's who is important in this.", "NTA you just wanted to be helpful and make a connection, it\u2019s totally normal when you see someone trying at something and one sees room for improvement to teach them a little.", "NTA, I don't get what people are talking about unsolicited advice here. In this context and as a relative. Giving such simple advice to a young kid is normal. You would want youngsters to advance, and it was a valid point that would improve her skills.\n\nNow the question is why did she go back and destroy her old drawings. This is what you should ask your brother. Just shading advice won't make someone insecure about their drawings.", "Honestly NTA whether she asked for criticism or not. What you said was the guidance that a teacher may give in a lesson, nothing offensive or harsh, unless you\u2019re watering down how you delivered this to her? It\u2019s a shame she got frustrated but her dad should have used that as an opportunity to teach her that these things take practice and how to handle constructive criticism in the right way.", "NTA. It's surprising she has got to a competent level without knowing about the importance of light. You've been helpful and perhaps she's embarrassed that she hadn't understood about light till you showed her.", "NTA but maybe do a drawing with her", "NTA You we\u2019re giving constructive criticism, Emily is 12 so maybe she\u2019s not mature enough to realise that and act on it correctly. But your brother shouldn\u2019t be blaming you, especially considering her age.", "NTA - you offered good advice to someone who seems to be taking drawing as seriously as possible at that age. If she didn\u2019t want the advice, she would ignore it and keep doing what she was doing. You know how I know? I was in her position. I was obsessed with drawing at that age. And often had people give me unsolicited advice. Some I liked because it fit my goals at the time (to be a comic book artist) and plenty I ignored (including shading, since it wasn\u2019t really the style I was trying to emulate, stuff like Mark Bagley). I had no problem sorting out advice that was good and advice I didn\u2019t need at that age, and I doubt she does either. If she took the advice, asked for or not, she finds value in it. \n\nThe issue here is that she got frustrated (which like, welcome to art!) and had an emotional reaction (welcome to being 12!). It seems like her dad needs someone to blame instead of talking to his daughter about emotional regulation and not letting perfection get in the way of incremental growth. Even if her interest is purely casual it\u2019s expected to sometimes be frustrated by an inability to execute something as an artist. \n\nIgnore the YTA people here and talk to your niece about the fact that progress is incremental and that you only become proficient by first doing something poorly many many times.", "YTA. Based on your comments. Your niece was showing you her work, she didn\u2019t say anything about how to fix it. All you did explore a range of 2 and 3 dimensional approaches and to work with a range of things, such ad drawing, textiles, printmaking, sculptures and life drawings.
