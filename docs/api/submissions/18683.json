And if you do have the need, word it gently for someone younger as they might not have learned those techniques yet. Maybe word it like: \"Wow, that looks great! Hey Niece, I, too, am somewhat an artist. Do you want me to show you some tips and tricks?\"", "Based on the information provided, your intentions to teach and guide your niece in improving her drawings were well-intentioned. As an individual with expertise in art, you noticed a particular aspect that could be improved, specifically shading, and you offered guidance to help her understand and apply the concept.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider the emotional impact of your feedback on a young and developing artist. While your intentions may have been positive, it appears that your niece felt insecure and frustrated, resulting in her tearing up her drawings and becoming upset. It is important to recognize that criticism, even when constructive, can have varying effects on individuals, especially children.\n\nIn this scenario, the question of whether you are the asshole (TA) or not the asshole (NTA) depends on how you approached the situation and delivered your feedback. If you provided constructive criticism in a supportive and gentle manner, emphasizing the room for improvement while also acknowledging the strengths of her drawings, you could be considered NTA.\n\nHowever, if your feedback was delivered without sensitivity and caused significant distress to your niece, then you would be deemed TA. It is crucial to balance constructive feedback with empathy and encouragement, particularly when dealing with young artists who may be more vulnerable to feelings of self-doubt.\n\nIn conclusion, the determination of whether you are the asshole (TA) or not the asshole (NTA) depends on the manner in which you provided feedback to your niece. Ensuring that your guidance is delivered with sensitivity and compassion is essential in nurturing her artistic growth and preserving her confidence.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But maybe use compliment sandwiches when constructively critiquing her art from now on. Or, if you have the spare time and energy and are inclined to do so, you might help her to receive the criticism in the encouraging and helpful spirit in which it was intended by sitting down to demonstrate the techniques you're telling her about and maybe even drawing together a bit so she can learn by watching you rather than just trying it out on her own and feeling disappointed/frustrated by her efforts. \n\nLike, I remember being really insecure in my talents at that age and a lot of other people I knew also were (and just insecure in general), and it obviously isn't your fault that she's a preteen but it'd be a pretty easy thing to accommodate and work around moving forward.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA as an artist myself and I\u2019d say I\u2019m pretty good having been an artist pretty much all my life.. I WISH I had someone to teach me about shading when I first started. It took a long time before I learned correct shading. Being an artist and being passionate about it can lead to frustrations I\u2019ve ripped up MANY drawings as a kid and it had NOTHING to do with anyone saying anything to me. It\u2019s a learning process and anger is definitely a common reaction when learning about something your passionate about.. alot in art, can\u2019t get the perfect shading = equals lots of frustration. Same goes with color, shape, lines ect..\nHas anyone asked her if what you said upset her? \nI know this child isn\u2019t \u201cevery artist\u201d so no one can speak for her\u2026 so has anyone asked what she thought?

How are you showed her? what she could improve on, but maybe you should\u2019ve been with her like sit down and showed her how to do it I guess it\u2019s not really your fault that she got upset about not knowing how to do it, but maybe to allow that to happen you should\u2019ve showed her in person how to do it correct but also then again she is 12 years old it doesn\u2019t really matter too much on accuracy.", "I don't know.  I would have loved a tutor at that age. \n\nBut it really depends on whether your help was sought or pushed, and whether it was addressed at an appropriate level.", "NTA You were simply trying to teach her some basics. She would have found that out anyway if she were to actualy take a course on drawing one day if she is that passionate. The thing with criticizim though is that you have to coat it pretty well in sugar, like 95-99% sugar and then add the thing you need to say. It usually depends on the person how well they take it or how much they apreciate the input, but with a kid it's unpredictable. Your brothers reaction and anger are very misplaced. He could have used the incident to teach her about emotional restraint and not making harsh decisions out of impluse. Instead of ripping up the drawings or correcting them, she could try to recreate them with the new knowledge and then study the differences and see for herself the progress in time. Also maybe it's ok to tell her that many artists end up destroying their own work for different reasons, if she really wants to do that it's ok, but the best approach would still be the one where you keep the art and then in time it will make you feel better to see the progress. It's only normal to get better and better in time, but that does not mean you should destroy older art which you might now see lacks different things. It's like photographs, you don't get rid of the one's when you were a baby just because you're getting older.", "NTA\n\nGiven her drastic reaction, I would assume it\u2019s one of the first time Emily heard constructive criticism.

Emily is definitely an artist, but she hasn't realized that you don't have to change something you already did. You can make something new. There might be an OCD leaning in there, too. But if you can, talk with your brother, and tell him you'd like to explain about that to Emily. Run the explanation by him first, along with profound apologies for having set this off. Accident, yes, I know, but it's a kindness to Emily and she's who is important in this.", "NTA you just wanted to be helpful and make a connection, it\u2019s totally normal when you see someone trying at something and one sees room for improvement to teach them a little.", "NTA, I don't get what people are talking about unsolicited advice here. In this context and as a relative. Giving such simple advice to a young kid is normal. You would want youngsters to advance, and it was a valid point that would improve her skills.\n\nNow the question is why did she go back and destroy her old drawings. This is what you should ask your brother. Just shading advice won't make someone insecure about their drawings.", "Honestly NTA whether she asked for criticism or not. What you said was the guidance that a teacher may give in a lesson, nothing offensive or harsh, unless you\u2019re watering down how you delivered this to her? It\u2019s a shame she got frustrated but her dad should have used that as an opportunity to teach her that these things take practice and how to handle constructive criticism in the right way.", "NTA. It's surprising she has got to a competent level without knowing about the importance of light. You've been helpful and perhaps she's embarrassed that she hadn't understood about light till you showed her.", "NTA but maybe do a drawing with her", "NTA You we\u2019re giving constructive criticism, Emily is 12 so maybe she\u2019s not mature enough to realise that and act on it correctly. But your brother shouldn\u2019t be blaming you, especially considering her age.", "NTA - you offered good advice to someone who seems to be taking drawing as seriously as possible at that age. If she didn\u2019t want the advice, she would ignore it and keep doing what she was doing. You know how I know? I was in her position. I was obsessed with drawing at that age. And often had people give me unsolicited advice. Some I liked because it fit my goals at the time (to be a comic book artist) and plenty I ignored (including shading, since it wasn\u2019t really the style I was trying to emulate, stuff like Mark Bagley). I had no problem sorting out advice that was good and advice I didn\u2019t need at that age, and I doubt she does either. If she took the advice, asked for or not, she finds value in it. \n\nThe issue here is that she got frustrated (which like, welcome to art!) and had an emotional reaction (welcome to being 12!). It seems like her dad needs someone to blame instead of talking to his daughter about emotional regulation and not letting perfection get in the way of incremental growth. Even if her interest is purely casual it\u2019s expected to sometimes be frustrated by an inability to execute something as an artist. \n\nIgnore the YTA people here and talk to your niece about the fact that progress is incremental and that you only become proficient by first doing something poorly many many times.", "YTA. Based on your comments. Your niece was showing you her work, she didn\u2019t say anything about how to fix it. All you did explore a range of 2 and 3 dimensional approaches and to work with a range of things, such ad drawing, textiles, printmaking, sculptures and life drawings.

I'm not going to say soft because you're 34, near the same age as me, and you ought to have known better.\n\nI take wet on wet (Bob Ross method) painting classes in my small town because they never let us paint this technique in college. I'm learning and humbled by my teacher, a middle aged woman who took a few classes from Stephen Ross. My paintings look just like the reference and no one else's does, but do i go around trying to \"help\" others? Nah dog. I step back and look to my left and right and compliment them. Find the beautiful and subtle parts and encourage them to keep going, to keep trying, and they are doing great. Remind them that each peice of art is unique and beautiful. *IF* (and that's a big if) a freind in the class says \"hey, how do you do -insert technical brush skill-, I'll happily grab some scratch and show them the technique. But that's it. Only when asked. \n\nYou overstepped, and trampled on the kids work. Whatever you do don't keep comparing your artwork to hers. I think really of all you did that was probably the worst. For her it must have felt like someone was comparing her work to the Mona Lisa, and who wouldn't be totally demotivated and feel like they are lacking in skill or talent, especially a child? \n\nAnd not for nothing, but maybe she's a budding cubist or dadaist or fauvist and shading is something she'll never really need.", "i know your heart was in the right place. you most likely saw yourself in this kid; just an aspiring artist who wanted to improve and would take any criticism if it meant getting better. I know I personally had this exact conversation with my older stepsister, and it helped me improve a lot. i still remember the conversation to this day, and if she never explained lighting to me, i would not be where i am now. The problem isnt emily's age either; I was around 10 when my stepsister told me this, and i took it fine.  \n\n\nThe problem is I ASKED for that criticism. She helped me improve because it was just something we did together. The most important thing about being an artist is not 'helping' people who didnt ask for it. Sometimes people just want to draw, and you pointing out the flaws and how they could improve just makes it into a chore, especially for a young child. That kid went to someone they look up to hoping for a 'wow thats super pretty!!' not an in depth description of why they were wrong and how they could improve. It doesnt \\*matter\\* if their drawing wasn't perfect. They were doing it for fun. This is not their job and they do not need to 'improve' their art if they do it simply because they enjoy it. You are making this into a chore for the kid because they feel like they can never be complimented and accepted unless they make a 'perfect' piece.", "YTA. Your niece didn't ask to be critiqued. She wanted you to say \"great job that looks awesome!\" and encourage her. I'm 34. I've been drawing off and on since I was 10. Still not great, I don't do it often, it's purely just a boredom thing. But ANYWAY.....one of my best friends has a degree in art, and I've shown her stuff. You know what she did if she felt the need to critique to help me improve? She asked if she could give me some constructive criticism.\n\nMost people of any age, when they show you things they made that they are proud of, they aren't doing it to get critiqued. They want to share their pride with you. If they want advice on it, they will surely ask.

Let's draw some mushrooms together and I'll show you some cool tricks!\" \n\nTelling the child that the shading was wrong isn't helpful.", ">\tIt\u2019s not impolite to give good faith advice.\n\nOutside of a serious matter (e.g., an intervention), yes it is. \n\n>\tit\u2019s juvenile to think that advice you didn\u2019t specifically ask for is rude.\n\nThere are people in your social circle who wish you would talk less.", "I was referencing the other posters and directly responding to the poster above me.", "Then I'll recant. I've always received unsolicited feedback in multiple avenues of life. It doesn't mean that it's the right way to go about things.", "You don\u2019t have to be unhappy with something to be given advice. That kind of logic makes no sense.\n\nAdvice is just guidance. If someone gave me advice on what the best way of cooking a certain dish was, I don\u2019t have to be unhappy with my cooking for that advice to be allowed to be given.", ">You straight up told her that her drawings were wrong and didn't look the way they should\n\nNo, I did not do that. I said that the lighting was inaccurate. That is a completely different thing.", "Of course children need advice. Saying that because she\u2019s a child (one who evidently takes her drawing very seriously!) she can\u2019t be given advice is infantilizing. That\u2019s how you raise kids that think advice they didn\u2019t ask for is hostile and a personal attack.", "Of course children need advice.

If I hadn\u2019t had unsolicited advice thrown my way I would have stalled out and been much worse than I was. advice given in kindness and good faith shouldn\u2019t make someone an asshole.", "This is incredibly combative and very unrealistic.\n\nKids need to learn to take advice, solicited or not.  Especially when that advice comes from a place of kindness.  \n\nAgree with the person you're responding to that children need to be coached through these issues in order to grow and improve.  The world isn't as black and white as your posts suggest.", "When I hit reply your post only said \"Welcome to the world. Not everyone is like you.\"\n\nI don't know if that was because you were adding an edit or something displayed wrong. Regardless, there is an inherent implication there that what the other commenter said is invalid somehow, which is combative. I'm sorry you don't like that. Personally? I don't take issue with it. I think there's room on both sides.\n\nI do appreciate your tactic with the children you've handled. It's especially helpful when dealing with groups of children.\n\nHowever, one-on-one and based on how the OP described their approach, constructive feedback can be helpful. OP was trying to discuss some cool tricks, and looking at an example they had in front of them is helpful to illustrate what more their neice could take into consideration.\n\nAdditionally, while the school probably offers art courses it's entirely possible that they live in an area where art funding has been drastically cut and/or the school teacher is busy or teaching at a level meant for the rest of the class and not able to address the neice at her level, which sounds well above the average 12-year-old.\n\nOP tried to offer a cool trick of something more to consider and tried to meet her where she was at. We can't know exactly how the exchange went. Maybe neice or did something to indicate that moment was not a good time to approach growth. Maybe it only settled after OP left. Neice needs emotional guidance and additional reassurance. But that doesn't mean it's inherently wrong to offer artistic guidance either.", "Nah I think their social circle probably consist entirely of talentless assholes like themselves. No one with any actual creative drive or just basic manners would stick around that for very long.", "The point they are trying to get at is \"what made you think she needed or wanted your advice?\"", "You know what, I retract what I said before. You absolutely intended to be a dick to your niece. Also, she's a kid. Ffs.\n\n\nI really hope you didn't permanently destroy her love of drawing and that you absolutely never have children. You don't have the emotional maturity or the ability to treat someone else as an independent person so you would make a harmful parent.", "You could have given som guidance in how to handle disappointment when a drawing doesn't turn out right. Instead you set her up for disappointment with no tools to handle it. She's just a kid, she needs encouragement, not criticism", "Of course you don't, but that doesn't mean everything is a free for all crit session all the time.\n\nTake a step back: does she even really understand the idea of doing critique? You are way too inside baseball about it. You're viewing it as mentor/experienced peer sharing advice, which yes your point about advice would be true. But if she doesn't even understand critique that way (because...she's 12 and when she gets critiqued by family it's usually because she's in trouble) all she's feeling is someone who she trusts and wanted to validate her just looked at something she loved and went \"Cool, kind of shitty though.\" It was not something she was emotionally prepared for and you dumped it on her without following it up. It was not appropriate for the situation or the person. \n\nYou are not interacting with her in a way that is appropriate for a 12 year old whos learning and you aren't understanding your impact on her or taking responsibility for what it made her feel. It's not like she needs safety gloves for you to interact but even asking if she wants advice would have been better than unsolicited. There can be no longterm and healthy relationship to creativity and passion without having someone in your corner to cheer you on. She wanted you to be her person for that and you didn't meet her where she needed, and it's your mess to fix.", "She was enjoying herself just as she was. A kid having fun in a way so many adults struggle with. Drawing her mushrooms in whatever way made her happy without worrying about how they \"should\" look, or fussing over techniques, or making it \"better\". \n\nHeaven knows in this world she'll likely lose the ability to just enjoy herself without any care like that soon enough.\n\nShe didn't need guidance in that moment.", "Sorry, but inaccurate mean wrong. If you say the whole picture got bad, because the lighning is off, then you just said the drawing is wrong.\n\nIt is not a digital art, where you just do a quick undo, or put up a new layer. Things are mostly permanent.", "But OP isn't the childs mother. \nThis isn't her place to do so, unless asked otherwise. \n\nThe child wanted to show their aunt a picture they were proud of, not learn how to shade properly.", "Again, not everyone is like you. \n\nI've worked with kids for 10 years, not every child is the same. I would have kids from ages 6-14 come ask me for help. \n\nI also drew constantly as a child, and I was the opposite of you. I didn't care for the \"correct\" way, I just wanted to draw. \n\nOf course, that changed as I got older.", "If you would have stalled because of that the it's only because you're a shit artist with no internal drive.", "That's your problem.\n\nYour opinion is yours and mine is mine. \nLet's agree to disagree because it seems like we are going to defend what we believe until we are blue in the face.", "The intention is not as important as the effect of an action. If you intended to help someone and unintentionally make them feel awful about their prior work, then the net effect of your actions is not kind, it's in fact it's pretty brutal.\n\nSo here's some advice for you: \n\nIf someone is not asking for constructive criticism, don't criticize them.", "How is anything they said unrealistic?", "Yep, agree to disagree.", "I don\u2019t understand you. What did I say that made you think that I intended to be a dick to Emily?", "But her ability to handle disappointment wasn\u2019t what we were talking about. Unless this is my autism once again refusing to let me see what is appropriate in social situations, her showing me her drawings and then me saying \u201cwell when a drawing doesn\u2019t turn out the way we want it to\u2026\u201d would have come across even worse?", "Even as a teenager, when someone shut down/criticize my hobbies, it hurt like hell. How can anyone think it is good for a child?", "If you don\u2019t care for the advice you ignore it. That doesn\u2019t make the advice giver an asshole.", "That was my first comment, why does it seem to you that I'm going to defend what I believe until I'm \"blue in the face\"?  \n\nIt's also the third time I've counted from your responses in this thread that you've told someone their opinion is their problem - it's an odd way to converse and further illustrates your combative approach to this thread.", "Offering advice is not criticism."]}
