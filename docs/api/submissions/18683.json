Hey Niece, I, too, am somewhat an artist. Do you want me to show you some tips and tricks?\"", "Based on the information provided, your intentions to teach and guide your niece in improving her drawings were well-intentioned. As an individual with expertise in art, you noticed a particular aspect that could be improved, specifically shading, and you offered guidance to help her understand and apply the concept.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider the emotional impact of your feedback on a young and developing artist. While your intentions may have been positive, it appears that your niece felt insecure and frustrated, resulting in her tearing up her drawings and becoming upset. It is important to recognize that criticism, even when constructive, can have varying effects on individuals, especially children.\n\nIn this scenario, the question of whether you are the asshole (TA) or not the asshole (NTA) depends on how you approached the situation and delivered your feedback. If you provided constructive criticism in a supportive and gentle manner, emphasizing the room for improvement while also acknowledging the strengths of her drawings, you could be considered NTA.\n\nHowever, if your feedback was delivered without sensitivity and caused significant distress to your niece, then you would be deemed TA. It is crucial to balance constructive feedback with empathy and encouragement, particularly when dealing with young artists who may be more vulnerable to feelings of self-doubt.\n\nIn conclusion, the determination of whether you are the asshole (TA) or not the asshole (NTA) depends on the manner in which you provided feedback to your niece.

But maybe use compliment sandwiches when constructively critiquing her art from now on. Or, if you have the spare time and energy and are inclined to do so, you might help her to receive the criticism in the encouraging and helpful spirit in which it was intended by sitting down to demonstrate the techniques you're telling her about and maybe even drawing together a bit so she can learn by watching you rather than just trying it out on her own and feeling disappointed/frustrated by her efforts. \n\nLike, I remember being really insecure in my talents at that age and a lot of other people I knew also were (and just insecure in general), and it obviously isn't your fault that she's a preteen but it'd be a pretty easy thing to accommodate and work around moving forward.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA as an artist myself and I\u2019d say I\u2019m pretty good having been an artist pretty much all my life.. I WISH I had someone to teach me about shading when I first started. It took a long time before I learned correct shading. Being an artist and being passionate about it can lead to frustrations I\u2019ve ripped up MANY drawings as a kid and it had NOTHING to do with anyone saying anything to me. It\u2019s a learning process and anger is definitely a common reaction when learning about something your passionate about.. alot in art, can\u2019t get the perfect shading = equals lots of frustration.

How are you showed her? what she could improve on, but maybe you should\u2019ve been with her like sit down and showed her how to do it I guess it\u2019s not really your fault that she got upset about not knowing how to do it, but maybe to allow that to happen you should\u2019ve showed her in person how to do it correct but also then again she is 12 years old it doesn\u2019t really matter too much on accuracy.", "I don't know.  I would have loved a tutor at that age. \n\nBut it really depends on whether your help was sought or pushed, and whether it was addressed at an appropriate level.", "NTA You were simply trying to teach her some basics. She would have found that out anyway if she were to actualy take a course on drawing one day if she is that passionate. The thing with criticizim though is that you have to coat it pretty well in sugar, like 95-99% sugar and then add the thing you need to say. It usually depends on the person how well they take it or how much they apreciate the input, but with a kid it's unpredictable. Your brothers reaction and anger are very misplaced. He could have used the incident to teach her about emotional restraint and not making harsh decisions out of impluse. Instead of ripping up the drawings or correcting them, she could try to recreate them with the new knowledge and then study the differences and see for herself the progress in time. Also maybe it's ok to tell her that many artists end up destroying their own work for different reasons, if she really wants to do that it's ok, but the best approach would still be the one where you keep the art and then in time it will make you feel better to see the progress. It's only normal to get better and better in time, but that does not mean you should destroy older art which you might now see lacks different things. It's like photographs, you don't get rid of the one's when you were a baby just because you're getting older.", "NTA\n\nGiven her drastic reaction, I would assume it\u2019s one of the first time Emily heard constructive criticism.

In this context and as a relative. Giving such simple advice to a young kid is normal. You would want youngsters to advance, and it was a valid point that would improve her skills.\n\nNow the question is why did she go back and destroy her old drawings. This is what you should ask your brother. Just shading advice won't make someone insecure about their drawings.", "Honestly NTA whether she asked for criticism or not. What you said was the guidance that a teacher may give in a lesson, nothing offensive or harsh, unless you\u2019re watering down how you delivered this to her? It\u2019s a shame she got frustrated but her dad should have used that as an opportunity to teach her that these things take practice and how to handle constructive criticism in the right way.", "NTA. It's surprising she has got to a competent level without knowing about the importance of light. You've been helpful and perhaps she's embarrassed that she hadn't understood about light till you showed her.", "NTA but maybe do a drawing with her", "NTA You we\u2019re giving constructive criticism, Emily is 12 so maybe she\u2019s not mature enough to realise that and act on it correctly. But your brother shouldn\u2019t be blaming you, especially considering her age.", "NTA - you offered good advice to someone who seems to be taking drawing as seriously as possible at that age. If she didn\u2019t want the advice, she would ignore it and keep doing what she was doing. You know how I know? I was in her position. I was obsessed with drawing at that age. And often had people give me unsolicited advice. Some I liked because it fit my goals at the time (to be a comic book artist) and plenty I ignored (including shading, since it wasn\u2019t really the style I was trying to emulate, stuff like Mark Bagley). I had no problem sorting out advice that was good and advice I didn\u2019t need at that age, and I doubt she does either. If she took the advice, asked for or not, she finds value in it. \n\nThe issue here is that she got frustrated (which like, welcome to art!) and had an emotional reaction (welcome to being 12!). It seems like her dad needs someone to blame instead of talking to his daughter about emotional regulation and not letting perfection get in the way of incremental growth. Even if her interest is purely casual it\u2019s expected to sometimes be frustrated by an inability to execute something as an artist. \n\nIgnore the YTA people here and talk to your niece about the fact that progress is incremental and that you only become proficient by first doing something poorly many many times.", "YTA. Based on your comments. Your niece was showing you her work, she didn\u2019t say anything about how to fix it.

I'm not going to say soft because you're 34, near the same age as me, and you ought to have known better.\n\nI take wet on wet (Bob Ross method) painting classes in my small town because they never let us paint this technique in college. I'm learning and humbled by my teacher, a middle aged woman who took a few classes from Stephen Ross. My paintings look just like the reference and no one else's does, but do i go around trying to \"help\" others? Nah dog. I step back and look to my left and right and compliment them. Find the beautiful and subtle parts and encourage them to keep going, to keep trying, and they are doing great. Remind them that each peice of art is unique and beautiful. *IF* (and that's a big if) a freind in the class says \"hey, how do you do -insert technical brush skill-, I'll happily grab some scratch and show them the technique. But that's it. Only when asked. \n\nYou overstepped, and trampled on the kids work. Whatever you do don't keep comparing your artwork to hers. I think really of all you did that was probably the worst. For her it must have felt like someone was comparing her work to the Mona Lisa, and who wouldn't be totally demotivated and feel like they are lacking in skill or talent, especially a child? \n\nAnd not for nothing, but maybe she's a budding cubist or dadaist or fauvist and shading is something she'll never really need.", "i know your heart was in the right place. you most likely saw yourself in this kid; just an aspiring artist who wanted to improve and would take any criticism if it meant getting better. I know I personally had this exact conversation with my older stepsister, and it helped me improve a lot. i still remember the conversation to this day, and if she never explained lighting to me, i would not be where i am now. The problem isnt emily's age either; I was around 10 when my stepsister told me this, and i took it fine.  \n\n\nThe problem is I ASKED for that criticism. She helped me improve because it was just something we did together. The most important thing about being an artist is not 'helping' people who didnt ask for it. Sometimes people just want to draw, and you pointing out the flaws and how they could improve just makes it into a chore, especially for a young child. That kid went to someone they look up to hoping for a 'wow thats super pretty!!' not an in depth description of why they were wrong and how they could improve. It doesnt \\*matter\\* if their drawing wasn't perfect. They were doing it for fun. This is not their job and they do not need to 'improve' their art if they do it simply because they enjoy it. You are making this into a chore for the kid because they feel like they can never be complimented and accepted unless they make a 'perfect' piece.", "YTA. Your niece didn't ask to be critiqued. She wanted you to say \"great job that looks awesome!\" and encourage her. I'm 34. I've been drawing off and on since I was 10. Still not great, I don't do it often, it's purely just a boredom thing. But ANYWAY.....one of my best friends has a degree in art, and I've shown her stuff. You know what she did if she felt the need to critique to help me improve? She asked if she could give me some constructive criticism.\n\nMost people of any age, when they show you things they made that they are proud of, they aren't doing it to get critiqued. They want to share their pride with you. If they want advice on it, they will surely ask.

Sometimes even negative experiences don't always spring from someone being an AH. Niece asked Aunt what she thought, and as she knew something about art, she combined praise with suggestions. She meant to help the niece learn and doesn't appear to have approached it by saying her artwork was bad, but rather introducing her to an aspect of drawing she didn't appear to be aware of before. More importantly, niece appears to have taken the critique/suggestion ok in the moment--they seemed to have a casual meeting of the minds as artists--but then realized it was harder than she thought when practicing which led to her getting frustrated. That doesn't seem like a wild or malicious progression. I feel like this is not an uncommon learning experience that everyone goes through at least a few times in their life. The age range sounds about right too; I feel like 9-12 is when kids start getting criticisms in their feedback rather than just praise. Imo, the real AH move is for the aunt not to call her niece up, talk about it, reinforce that her skill is great and growing and *that's true for everyone, in every field, at every age*.

I remember spending hours and hours trying to get body proportions and shading right at that age, because 12 is old enough to recognise when art doesn't quite look right.", "But, there's also the self critical stage you hit before you have serious skills to consider.\n\nI, personally, was usually pretty happy to have a better artist give me little tips like light sources, or basic proportions,etc.  Nothing worse that knowing you're missing something that others can do, but not knowing what you are missing.\n\nAnd, honestly, the idea you can't get past that self critical stage is BS.  I've always loved drawing, and art in general.  Took it all through school, plus 4 years of university in Fine Art, and 3 more in college for Graphic Design.  Worked for game companies, worked as a designer, still do art on my own.   I hit the self critical point, and move past it, every few years, as I max out one thing, and decide to try a new one.", "Ask a kid in kindergarten to do fractions and then come back bc you clearly can't comprehend the difference between a 12 year olds education and that of a high schooler.", "Sometimes people take this 'no unsolicited advice' thing waaay too far. If I'm learning a skill and someone more experienced offers to give me tips and teaching, that's awesome. \n\nPresumably the niece *wanted* the advice because she took the tips on board and tried to learn from them. In my experience if kids don't want to hear something, they don't listen and they *definitely* don't spend hours trying to follow the advice.

Maybe unearth some old sketchbooks from their own drawing classes or pull up one of the thousands of lighting and shading tutorials easily available on the internet.

It's the hardest lessons to learn in life because they feel so bad while learning but it honestly helps. OP should call niece and praise her again for her skill then suggest they practice shading together so they can both improve as a way to show niece that adults also need practice, OP could even ask niece how OPs drawings can improve to continue the cycle of positive feedback and helpful critiques.", "The AH is the parents for accepting Emily's poor behaviour and then blaming her aunt", "Guess Vermeer was wrong then.\n\nEdit: And Caravaggio.", "I think it's a balancing act, and I don't know enough about the kid in question to say whether OP made a good call or not.

Hard to say without knowing the kid. I just know that, like I said, it's a one-way door.

Jesus Christ she wasn\u2019t telling her how to dress, she was giving her useful tips that was within her skill set. \n\n\u201cOnly a child\u2019s mother can give her drawing tips\u201d is the most Reddit brained thing I\u2019ve seen all week lol.", "> I would have kids from ages 6-14 come ask me for help.\n\nAh, so kids need \u201chelp\u201d, but never advice?", ">You could have given som guidance in how to handle disappointment when a drawing doesn't turn out right\n\ncome off it, OP isn't a mind reader.
