After the call I realized I don\u2019t want to see him at Christmas or spend time with him. And then I realized I don\u2019t have to! So I canceled my flight and I'm planning to go to my bf's friend's house for Christmas day.\n\nI texted my dad tonight that I won't be visiting for Christmas since I don't want to be around him and that I already canceled my flight. I told him that being around him is frustrating and stresses me out and I'd rather spend my Christmas holidays with people who build me up and also since I am an adult, I can choose who I want or don't want in my life.\n\nHe tried calling me, I didn't answer because I didn't want to argue with him and make us both more stressed out. He left me a voicemail asking me to call him back, I ignored it of course. He then texted me \"If you're trying to hurt me, congrats you win\".\n\nNow I feel like an AH.

That involves adult conflict resolution and paying your own way. \n\nParents and adult kids get into disagreements all the time. The adult way to do it is to talk it out, not just cancel this trip back home like a big temper tantrum. If you don\u2019t want to see him, then you shouldn\u2019t be taking his money. What you did was rude and hurtful. And ignoring his call is the cherry on top of this shit sundae.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYour dad doesn't approve of your college major and argues with you about it. So what? It's not like he told you: \"My way or the highway!\". And because he dares to *gasp* hold a different opinion to you, you're punishing him. \nBuilding someone up doesn't mean not arguing or disagreeing with them.\nYou sound entitled and childish.", "Sounds like you are 100% financially dependent on your father -  tuition, room & board. At 20, I\u2019m guessing you have 2 more years of school and need/would like to keep your dad\u2019s financial support.  \nYou don\u2019t have to spend time with people you don\u2019t want to. You can choose to live your life how you wish.  BUT you need to be able to support those choices.  You\u2019ve made a statement by canceling your ticket.  Now answer your phone and talk to your dad.  You need to come to an agreement or you may not have your spring semester paid for by dad.  \nJust curious, what it your major?", "YTA\nYou want to be an adult but you sure aren\u2019t acting like an adult. You are punishing him for having a disagreement with him. That\u2019s childish. Then you won\u2019t even take his calls. Even more childish. \n\nYou are right, you don\u2019t have to go. He also doesn\u2019t have to pay for college. If you want to be treated like an adult then act like one, go there and discuss it like an adult. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to your family to cancel at the last minute like this. They likely had plans set up already. \n\nObviously you want to major in whatever you want. But young are far from the first person who had that problem. My grandfather wanted to be an architect but his dad said no. It was the Great Depression and no one was building things. She he b\u00e9came and attorney and then a very well respected judge. \n\nI argued with my parents over my major too. But I didn\u2019t punish them by not showing up for a holiday. \n\nYou need to face this head on and be done with it. All your doing is avoiding your problem and prolonging it. That will only make things worse. You are compounding your problem by creating a new problem without resolving the other. I don\u2019t think you will have a great time because it will be weighing on your mind. The best thing to do is resolve the problem, not run away and make your dad sad. He obviously loves you very much. At least treat him with a little respect and love. \n\nI no longer have the option to spend any holidays with my parents. So please be grateful you still have him, he won\u2019t be around for you forever.", "If you want to play at being a grown up you should be paying your own expenses. Hurting your dad for having a difference of opinion is cruel and childish", "YTA. Hopefully your dad got his money back on your plane ticket and can go to a nice dinner on his birthday without his ungrateful child. \n\nBTW, he pays for your life 100%. He's allowed to vocalize his displeasure. You may be over the age of 18, but you're not an adult. Call your mf dad.", "YTA\n\nYou are an adult and can make your own decisions. You are also old enough to understand that your actions have consequences and as an adult you have to be prepared to accept those consequences. Your dad is paying your college expenses. You are 20 and he has no obligation to you to continue to pay those expenses. You cut him off and he is well within his rights to stop providing any financial assistance. \n\nSo unless you are prepared to take out student loans and get a job that allows you to be completely self sufficient while you put yourself through school, you might want to consider picking up the phone, apologizing and trying to repair the damage you have done. You also need to pay him back the cost of the ticket that you canceled.", "Take a read through some of the reasons that people on here are torn about avoiding family: their parents took sides with their abusers; their family member blamed them something clearly not their fault and kicked them out without notice; their family berated them for not buying Christmas gifts for an infant because they can barely pay rent. Your dad cares about you and is providing for your education because he cares about your future security and well-being. He reserves the right to disagree about your major because he has seen other people struggle financially and he wants you to have everything you need. He might not have expressed himself well, and your conversation got heated. You might feel exhausted by his lack of understanding and confidence in you and your decisions. But he loves you. What are some ways you might build your relationship while setting limits on arguing about something you clearly aren't going to see eye to eye about? \n\nRelationships with family take communication, and are worth some stress and difficulty. We might not always agree but that doesn't change that we love each other. Family is often there for you when no one else is. If you continue refusing to communicate and you intentionally drift off, YWBTA.", "YTA.

You\u2019ve been rude and disrespectful to someone who is paying for your college. Someone who will likely stop paying if you cut him off. Is that what you want? You want to give up your college education and your relationship with your dad because he disagrees with you?\n\nYou want to be an adult now you have to act like one. You\u2019re being childish and hurtful to your father for no reason. Shame on you.", "I'm not gonna say whether you're the A.H. or not, I'm just going to tell you that you're not going to have your dad around forever.

And if they do, they\u2019re generally going there for something else. And if they sense that someone is onto them, or if their therapy isn\u2019t giving them the desired result (eg their wife getting back with them, or them being validated), they often quit.\n\nJust fucking forget that I even mentioned covert narcissism and just take my description of his behaviour for what it is - the reason I am giving OP the benefit of the doubt here.\n\n[Edited for clarity]", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 ok, whatever you say. im not carrying on a conversation with someone who edits every comment they make after i've responded lol\n\nedit: damn i'm getting downvoted for pointing out someone else's complete lack of internet etiquette? damn", "I\u2019m editing for clarity, first of all. I forgot to make a distinction between therapist and psychologist because I was using your wording, and then realized that would confuse other people in the comments. \n\nTrust me, I am the first one to come at people in the comments for claiming they have ADHD without a diagnosis, or calling every single person who acts selfish a narcissist.\n\nBut this has been my whole goddamned life, and we have gone to great lengths to understand his behaviour and prepare ourselves for my mother to leave him. We have done our homework, and this \u201ceducated suspicion\u201d about him has finally helped us to unpack what we have been dealing with for 30-40 years.\n\n[Edited for clarity]", "if you were editing for clarity, you wouldn't add or change entire paragraphs without saying \"Edit for clarity:\" first. it's not very clear when you're just changing all your responses to make me look wrong. \ud83e\udd25"]}
