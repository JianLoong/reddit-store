I had a very rough first trimester with morning sickness which is now tapering off, but I still have it some days. During my first trimester, I found out the hard way that the smell of tuna will trigger vomiting for me. \n\nMy supervisor, let\u2019s call him Dave, whose office is about 10 feet from my desk will usually eat tuna and crackers for lunch. I disclosed my pregnancy to HR and Dave in the same meeting, and HR shooed him out to discuss my maternity benefits. I took the chance to question if I could ask Dave to refrain from tuna until I felt better as it triggers my morning sickness and I can smell it at my desk when he eats it. I was told I can certainly ask, but that HR cannot enforce anything as it isn\u2019t a documented allergy, which I was ok with. \n\nTalking to Dave one-on-one, I asked if he could not bring tuna in, or at least eat it in the break room that\u2019s a good 50ft from our office area. He said yes without hesitation as he doesn\u2019t want to be the cause of me being sick or interrupt my work flow. I profusely thanked him.\n\n12 weeks later and I am feeling much better than I was. Last week we did a test run in the break room to see if tuna still bothered me, and it does. I apologized and Dave was a bit huffy about it, but I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time.\n\nWhich brings us to today. I came back from lunch and Dave\u2019s door was closed which is not unusual. I\u2019ve been sitting for about five minutes when Dave pops out to chat with one of my coworkers and the tuna smell instantly hits me. Goodbye lunch.\n\nDave starts telling me I\u2019m overreacting and just being dramatic. That I can\u2019t expect everyone to cater to my pregnancy. My coworker tell him to back off and helps me get to the bathroom to clean up. I come back to my desk about 5 minutes later, someone used Febreeze but the tuna smell is EVERYWHERE and I get sick again. I grab a paper mask to try to mitigate the smell, but tuna is still all I can smell. \n\nAfter 20 minutes I can\u2019t take it anymore and request if I can go home early. Dave huffs and asks if I can\u2019t make it the final 3 hours. I told him no, and he hits back with that my leaving early will affect my end of year review. I said \u201cso be it\u201d and got  out of there.\n\nOn my drive home I get a call from HR. Dave told them what happened, and they again reiterate that they cannot keep Dave from eating whatever he wants in his office. I ask if my desk can be moved further away at least, to which I got \u201cwe\u2019ll look into it, but don\u2019t expect anything\u201d. They ended the call by saying to should seek other medication from my doctor so my illness isn\u2019t an office problem. \n\nSo now I\u2019m home, feeling like crap and waiting to hear back from my OB.
