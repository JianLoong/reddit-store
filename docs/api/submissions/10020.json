I don't pick people who  tend to copy off of others for their own success because at the end of the day it boils down to how little respect they truly have for someone else's hard work. \n\nIt's showing that your friend is going through a downward spiral right now so if possible could you sit her down and talk to her about it in the most non confrontational way possible. I tend to be the sort of person that doesn't like having others around when I break down, but I do somehow lend help when they do. \n\nIf possible, please speak with your friend calmly and have a girls night. If she still happens to have a problem or doesn't exactly give you a proper reason such as depression, burden, burnout syndrome etc, then do remind her that you're supposed to be sharing responsibility and that you might be there now but there's no telling if you both will walk down different paths in the future. \n\nYou feel disrespected when she wants credit for work you've been doing on your own. Independence comes with responsibility, a lot of people go through difficult times alone, this is an opportunity for the two of you to grow together and for her to evolve as a person and understand her boundaries better. \n\nI will not call you an AH because honestly, no matter how close I am with someone the moment they talk about copying off of me, I cut them out and lose respect for them immediately. Despite whatever she's going through that's no reason to drag both of you into trouble with professors (considering how strict they tend to be about plagiarism) \n\nRemind her that your there to help but only if she wants to help herself otherwise, please distance yourself from her so as to not create further resentment and harsh feelings between the both of you.", "There's a step to go before you commit to that. Personally I would seek revenge 1st. Put a lock on your door and everytime you go out play a nursery rhyme on repeat, nice and loud. Make sure sleep is disturbed and it will drive them nuts. \n\nMaybe buy some duck tape and put it down the middle of the living room and only clean 1 side. Make a point of making them look like a tit. Dirty tampons left in the bathroom, just before their friends come round. Make their lives a misery, if they don't get the point then turn your \"friend\" in.", "ESH yes, she sucks, tell her to get help and request to not live together anymore.\n\nYou don't need to report her, she's failing on her own. Let her learn from her own mistakes instead of trying to turn her in. \n\nI understand you're bitter about the situation, but you turning her in for cheating  is clearly revenge and not ok, it's you betraying her.", "You say she is your friend and she's self destructing. Why aren't you doing anything to find out why she is self destructing? Trying to get her help?

No need to burn down her life.", "YwNBTA.. Here's why.. If you give her your work, depending on the academic policies at your school,  most schools allow for kicking out the students who abet others in cheating. You have an academic responsibility to make sure you don't share your work with anyone else, especially if you know that they are going to cheat.\n\n\n\nYou don't need to rat her out, but you do need to cover your ass, at the very least. Don't give her your stuff..", "You aren\u2019t responsible for her, I would move out if possible, or if it is a college dorm complain to the dorm manager. You have a right to your rest.

I'm going to go NTA because it is really sucks to watch someone who doesn't care get the same reward, but in time, she will drop or flunk out.  \n\n\nI had shitty roommates in college. It's unfortunately part of the experience. Lesson here: Don't move in with friends. I moved in with my 2 best friends in college and resented the fuck out of them in 2 months. Once we split up our living situations, we got close again (after like 6 months of fall out). It's hardly ever a good idea.", "YWBTA\n\nIt seems like you might be motivated by revenge for her not pulling her weight domestically. This is understandable, but unhealthy imo.\n\nDon't give yourself the extra stress by putting yourself into a position where you make yourself responsible for someone else's growth as a person, or failure to grow as a person.\n\nFocus on your own work; her actions ultimately make no difference to your success, but this kind of slacking will always catch people up.", "NTA. Report it to cover your own ass in case she does steal your work. I hope you also find a different living situation quickly, too.", "YWBTA it's clear that she is having some issues. You don't know what is going on with her so stop assuming things. You say lazy but she could be depresses, and using alcohol and partying to cope. Why are you being so judgemental about her choices. Move out and live your life and also learn some empathy.", "[removed]", ">I am hoping she would get booted from the school and then would have no reason to live with me anymore, but that's neither here nor there. She doesn't deserve to be in class if she's not committed to it.\n\nYTA and YWBTA.\n\nThis part especially comes off as elitist, and even petty. \n\nIs she an AH for leaving all the housework to you? Yes.\n\nIs she an AH for being disruptive on school days? Yes.\n\nAre you well within your rights not to let her copy off of you? Yes.\n\nEverything else you've mentioned frankly doesn't concern you. You can ask to switch rooms or roommates. That's fine.\n\nGetting booted from school when she's clearly having an unhealthy relationship with herself is hardly a fair outcome. Why would you want that for her? The work you put in won't be of less quality just because she isn't as hardworking. Your grades won't be affected at all. And where do you draw the line anyway with that kind of thinking? Is everyone who's not getting straight As also undeserving to be there? What about those who don't get a 100% on their assignments? Or are we just supposed to kick out those that get Cs or Ds because they're not dedicated enough?", "Lol sorry but if you see someoe take something that's not theirs do you all just say nothing. This is partly what's fcked up with society, people do shit that's just wrong and don't get called out for it. There are plenty of situations I'd not mind Mt own business. If she isn't putting in the work like the rest of the students and wants to cheat then she can deal with the consequences. Doesn't deserve to be there if she's going to cheat. She's grown and knows better.", "YWBTAH, I 100% understand your frustrations but tattling won't help anyone. It would just be vindictive for the sake of being vindictive. \n\nAbsolutely maintain your boundary of not helping her with school in any way. Change your living situation asap.

About about how things have changed and it's affecting your life at the home y'all share? And expressed your unwillingness to contribute to her cheating? I'd do that first if you haven't. Just explain that you know you're in college and everyone is dealing with their freedom differently but that you have to draw the line when you feel you can't relax in your own home. I'd also explain that you aren't comfortable with cheating because ultimately it won't be beneficial to her and because you run the risk of getting in trouble as well.\n\nAlso, when is the lease up?\n\nETA: Either way, the solution isn't turning her in. I think you need to consider your motives and also know that it will catch up with her, one way or another. I'd let that play out and keep a clear conscience. Also, if you've willingly (even if begrudgingly) participated in any way, you could end up in a lot of trouble too.", "YWBTA. Your friend's actions are going to have consequences regardless.

I had a friend whose roommate was just like this. He stole answers from my friend and nearly got both of them kicked out of school. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s copying OP behind her back. Colleges take plagiarism extremely seriously and you should protect yourself.

It's perfectly within your rights to go to your professor and explain that your friend has asked you to share your work so she could plagiarise it, because there is a chance that she might decide to just take your work without asking and then have it end up with *you* being branded as the cheater, where your education is put at risk.\n\nYou have to protect yourself first and foremost. Why she's acting out isn't your business, and I get the frustration of working hard and seeing someone else just want to coast along to keep having fun.\n\nThe ones here saying \"mind your business\" haven't thought at all about the potential damage she could cause you. You need to be proactive when it comes to potential plagiarism in college/university. It might not even go further than a note taken to watch out for it, in any case, and then you'd still be safely covered.", "NTA. Let her figure it out herself. You owe her nothing. I hate people who think allowing this lazy behavior is okay. \n\nI personally would tell. Play stupid games. Win no/stupid prizes. \n\nI hate college kids who think they can act lazy, not do their work and make those who actually work hard, work harder. \n\nNo OP. I\u2019d sing like a canary.", "YWBTA. It is frustrating that she does nothing on her study while you study hard. But that is her problem. You just tell her no when she wants to copy your work. That is all you can do. Sooner or later she will not pass a class or get in trouble herself. Don\u2019t nudge her into that direction by telling on her. That is immature. Just don\u2019t give her your homework and focus on yourself.", "YWBTA. You\u2019re not her counsellor or her teacher. If she cheats it doesn\u2019t affect you at all. The moment her actions affect you, then you can do something about it. Complain about not sleeping, set rules, move out, whatever you want. But just \u201cplaning to do something\u201d doesn\u2019t concern you at all. It won\u2019t affect your schooling, your grades or your learning. It just seems like an act of revenge. Sure, don\u2019t let her copy your answers, but whatever she does with her own life is her own business, even if she\u2019s self-destroying. A friend would offer help with whatever she\u2019s going through. I can also tell that you\u2019re upset it\u2019s not fair that she can (potentially) pass with cheating while you\u2019re actually doing the work. Well life isn\u2019t fair, sometimes not everyone gets the same deal. Like if you\u2019re great at maths and can easily get a 100% without studying while someone has to study a whole week just to get one answer", "YWBTA. You have to recognize that while being dirty and obnoxious as a roommate are bothering you and possibly harming you, the potential cheating has absolutely nothing to do with you. You just want revenge and an outlet for your judgement. But the behaviors you\u2019re upset about wouldn\u2019t even bother you if you two weren\u2019t living together. So the solution isn\u2019t to try and get them kicked out of school. The solution is to move out. \n\nAlso if someone comes to you and asks you for help to cheat it\u2019s because they trust you. You know this. If you truly had such high moral standards, you simply would have said at the time that you want nothing to do with a violation of academic integrity. Instead, you\u2019ve turned yourself into some sort of informant for the prof for the express purpose of exposing your own roommate for actions taken in the privacy of their own space. That\u2019s pretty low and an AH move unto itself. \n\n.", "YTA if you turn her in. Try paying attention to your own work instead of hyperfocusing on her. What she does is none of your business.

You'll miss out on your own life while you worry about how others are living theirs.", "It\u2019s not ok to cheat. However it\u2019s not your job to tell on her just cause she may do it. She may get caught with her cheating (if she does it), and it\u2019s up to her to face the consequences of her actions. But how would you feel 5-10 years down the line looking back and knowing that the reason she got kicked out of school was just having an idea about cheating?", "Everyone has mental issues and the only answer is are you going to let it affect you to the point that you lose relationships or go to jail. If you don't make toxic people feel like shit they're not going to have a reason to change, that's why people who try to make Rock Bottom comfortable for those there they are not helping the problem they're just enablers. \n\nHaving mental health issues is not a valid excuse if you're not actively taking care of it with psychological counseling and medication. Going to a normal counseling is not going to cut it, only psychological counseling and medication will.", "It's wrong. If I don't fix this, who will?", "In the same way that benefits cheats, tax evaders, insurance scammers, shoplifters and all the other leaches affect us. By making society incrementally worse and stopping the rest of us having nice things.", "Because it's wrong and anyone sane would not be okay with it. Why should I knowingly let her cheat while everyone else puts the work in?", "She's not looking for reasons to snitch on people, not like she is stalking her classmates to see if they cheat.\n\nSame way I don't \"look for reasons\" to report crimes but yes if I saw someone steal something I would report it.", "I suppose that's true. I know her parents are suuuuper strict, but maybe this was why.", "When I say mental health I\u2019m talking about severe and chronic disorders like bipolar, schizophrenia, depression, psychosis, etc. Not run of the mill OCD or anxiety. \n\nTreating those with the \u201chit rock bottom\u201d mentality isn\u2019t always appropriate nor should it be applied so early on, it should be saved as a last resort. \n\nI also didn\u2019t use mental health as an excuse to be toxic, hence why I said her behavior is still wrong.", "It's not your issue to fix. If she always tries to sit by you during exams though you could ask that the teacher makes sure to seat you away from her because you find her distracting during your studies and homework time. Focus on you, and work on your life, not hers. Trust us, and be the main character in your story. Don't try to write her novel", "She will get caught some time.  \n\nThe problem is you appear to be doing so you would get to live alone not for some moral objection to cheating.  That would make you the asshole.\n\nShe also appears to have developed a drinking problem and while you aren\u2019t obligated to get her help if you want to try to intervene then trying to get her help for that rather than trying to get her kicked out of school would be a better course of sction", "You aren\u2019t fixing anything. You\u2019re being a self righteous AH. Mind your business.", "I know it\u2019s wrong, nobody is disputing that her cheating is wrong it most definitely is\n\nWhat you asked about is if it\u2019d be an AH move of you to go tell on her. And what most people (including myself) agree is, yes. \n\nIt is not *your* job to go around making sure everyone suffers the consequences of their own poor choices. What she is doing is wrong, but it\u2019s also not your place to decide *you\u2019re* going to make sure she\u2019s punished for it.", "You don\u2019t care about fixing anything or helping your roommate. And I say roommate because you are clearly not her friend since you see she\u2019s self destructing and clearly going through something, and don\u2019t care. You don\u2019t want to help her or check in and see if she\u2019s okay because you don\u2019t care about her. You just want to punish her, which is not your job. Yeah, she shouldn\u2019t be cheating, but you shouldn\u2019t call yourself friend when your response to her clearly struggling it to try to ruin her life instead of see if she\u2019s ok.", "OP: No one appointed me god, so I appointed myself. So I alone will decide the fate/life of my roommate. It \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThats how this sounds.", "Morality is subjective, and you don't get to shoehorn yours onto somebody else.\n\nYTA", "You are so young. Eventually you will learn that you can't fix everything and anyway, this is not your problem to fix. Try focusing all that energy on your studies instead", "OK, let\u2019s say for a minute that letting her get away with cheating is wrong and it is your moral responsibility to turn her in. Where does your moral responsibility for her end? If you are morally responsible for her cheating, are you not morally responsible for finding her help for her self-destructive behavior? Moralism is a messy, messy business and you cannot pick and choose based on your self-anointed sense of Justice.", "This is why no one likes snitches, who cares and who is it hurting? \n\nBy all means find a new roommate, she sounds horrible to live with, but this is not the way to handle it. Ywbta.", "You sound exactly like Sheldon Cooper", "Your shocked sensibilities are how it affects you.  Gotcha.", "Nope. Don't listen to these people. If she actually cheats and you have proof, please notify the school. This is why we have foolish assholes ruining so much of our society, IMO. Foolish assholes are skating by because \"don't be a rat\" is so prevalent. You know who else doesn't snitch on their associates for doing fucked up shit? Cops. Don't be a cop. Gather evidence and serve her a cold plate of karma.", "I'm sorry, are you comparing *trying* to cheat on homework assignments with the police being corrupt? Like in your mind, shooting people without consequences, and accepting bribes that allow organized crime to flourish is the same as wanting to copy someone else's homework?", "Right? \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed and self destructing and looking for bad solutions\u201d =\\= \u201cstate sanctioned corruption\u201d", "I know! I'm honestly in awe of this.", "People really do reach very far here, don't they?"]}
