I don't pick people who  tend to copy off of others for their own success because at the end of the day it boils down to how little respect they truly have for someone else's hard work. \n\nIt's showing that your friend is going through a downward spiral right now so if possible could you sit her down and talk to her about it in the most non confrontational way possible. I tend to be the sort of person that doesn't like having others around when I break down, but I do somehow lend help when they do. \n\nIf possible, please speak with your friend calmly and have a girls night. If she still happens to have a problem or doesn't exactly give you a proper reason such as depression, burden, burnout syndrome etc, then do remind her that you're supposed to be sharing responsibility and that you might be there now but there's no telling if you both will walk down different paths in the future. \n\nYou feel disrespected when she wants credit for work you've been doing on your own. Independence comes with responsibility, a lot of people go through difficult times alone, this is an opportunity for the two of you to grow together and for her to evolve as a person and understand her boundaries better. \n\nI will not call you an AH because honestly, no matter how close I am with someone the moment they talk about copying off of me, I cut them out and lose respect for them immediately. Despite whatever she's going through that's no reason to drag both of you into trouble with professors (considering how strict they tend to be about plagiarism) \n\nRemind her that your there to help but only if she wants to help herself otherwise, please distance yourself from her so as to not create further resentment and harsh feelings between the both of you.", "There's a step to go before you commit to that. Personally I would seek revenge 1st. Put a lock on your door and everytime you go out play a nursery rhyme on repeat, nice and loud. Make sure sleep is disturbed and it will drive them nuts. \n\nMaybe buy some duck tape and put it down the middle of the living room and only clean 1 side. Make a point of making them look like a tit. Dirty tampons left in the bathroom, just before their friends come round. Make their lives a misery, if they don't get the point then turn your \"friend\" in.", "ESH yes, she sucks, tell her to get help and request to not live together anymore.\n\nYou don't need to report her, she's failing on her own. Let her learn from her own mistakes instead of trying to turn her in. \n\nI understand you're bitter about the situation, but you turning her in for cheating  is clearly revenge and not ok, it's you betraying her.", "You say she is your friend and she's self destructing. Why aren't you doing anything to find out why she is self destructing? Trying to get her help?

No need to burn down her life.", "YwNBTA.. Here's why.. If you give her your work, depending on the academic policies at your school,  most schools allow for kicking out the students who abet others in cheating. You have an academic responsibility to make sure you don't share your work with anyone else, especially if you know that they are going to cheat.\n\n\n\nYou don't need to rat her out, but you do need to cover your ass, at the very least. Don't give her your stuff..", "You aren\u2019t responsible for her, I would move out if possible, or if it is a college dorm complain to the dorm manager. You have a right to your rest.

I'm going to go NTA because it is really sucks to watch someone who doesn't care get the same reward, but in time, she will drop or flunk out.  \n\n\nI had shitty roommates in college. It's unfortunately part of the experience. Lesson here: Don't move in with friends. I moved in with my 2 best friends in college and resented the fuck out of them in 2 months. Once we split up our living situations, we got close again (after like 6 months of fall out). It's hardly ever a good idea.", "YWBTA\n\nIt seems like you might be motivated by revenge for her not pulling her weight domestically. This is understandable, but unhealthy imo.\n\nDon't give yourself the extra stress by putting yourself into a position where you make yourself responsible for someone else's growth as a person, or failure to grow as a person.\n\nFocus on your own work; her actions ultimately make no difference to your success, but this kind of slacking will always catch people up.", "NTA. Report it to cover your own ass in case she does steal your work. I hope you also find a different living situation quickly, too.", "YWBTA it's clear that she is having some issues. You don't know what is going on with her so stop assuming things. You say lazy but she could be depresses, and using alcohol and partying to cope. Why are you being so judgemental about her choices. Move out and live your life and also learn some empathy.", "[removed]", ">I am hoping she would get booted from the school and then would have no reason to live with me anymore, but that's neither here nor there.

Yes.\n\nIs she an AH for being disruptive on school days? Yes.\n\nAre you well within your rights not to let her copy off of you? Yes.\n\nEverything else you've mentioned frankly doesn't concern you. You can ask to switch rooms or roommates. That's fine.\n\nGetting booted from school when she's clearly having an unhealthy relationship with herself is hardly a fair outcome. Why would you want that for her? The work you put in won't be of less quality just because she isn't as hardworking. Your grades won't be affected at all. And where do you draw the line anyway with that kind of thinking? Is everyone who's not getting straight As also undeserving to be there? What about those who don't get a 100% on their assignments? Or are we just supposed to kick out those that get Cs or Ds because they're not dedicated enough?", "Lol sorry but if you see someoe take something that's not theirs do you all just say nothing. This is partly what's fcked up with society, people do shit that's just wrong and don't get called out for it. There are plenty of situations I'd not mind Mt own business. If she isn't putting in the work like the rest of the students and wants to cheat then she can deal with the consequences. Doesn't deserve to be there if she's going to cheat. She's grown and knows better.", "YWBTAH, I 100% understand your frustrations but tattling won't help anyone. It would just be vindictive for the sake of being vindictive. \n\nAbsolutely maintain your boundary of not helping her with school in any way. Change your living situation asap.

Only what happens between you and her.", "[deleted]", "Have her read this very note and see if it wakes her up.  It must be so incredibly frustrating and maddening for you.

About about how things have changed and it's affecting your life at the home y'all share? And expressed your unwillingness to contribute to her cheating? I'd do that first if you haven't. Just explain that you know you're in college and everyone is dealing with their freedom differently but that you have to draw the line when you feel you can't relax in your own home. I'd also explain that you aren't comfortable with cheating because ultimately it won't be beneficial to her and because you run the risk of getting in trouble as well.\n\nAlso, when is the lease up?\n\nETA: Either way, the solution isn't turning her in. I think you need to consider your motives and also know that it will catch up with her, one way or another. I'd let that play out and keep a clear conscience. Also, if you've willingly (even if begrudgingly) participated in any way, you could end up in a lot of trouble too.", "YWBTA. Your friend's actions are going to have consequences regardless. No need to snitch. If you don't want to live with her any more, seek out a new living situation. And then put her out of your mind.", "YWBTA.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, I see this all the time. Someone gets to a breaking point, then all of a sudden the person they\u2019re talking about has somehow become a completely irredeemable person in every way, almost as a means of justifying some crazy retaliatory behavior.\n\nHer being messy has nothing to do with her cheating. But you added it, why? \n\nSay no to giving her your papers, and stay in your lane. Move out, live your life. Don\u2019t worry about hers.", "I strongly advise you to make sure she does not have access to your work while you aren\u2019t in the home.

I had a friend whose roommate was just like this. He stole answers from my friend and nearly got both of them kicked out of school. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s copying OP behind her back. Colleges take plagiarism extremely seriously and you should protect yourself.

Move out and move on.", "YTA - it sounds like you just want to turn her in to get back at her for how she acts at home. Just move out when you can and let it be. Sometimes friends can\u2019t live together which is fine, but if you do this you will burn that bridge and destroy her chance of ever going to college.", "YTA\n\nShe hasn't done anything yet. So you know nothing. \n\nIf you concretely know she's cheating that's one thing, but  'plans' mean nothing.", "NTA. It's perfectly within your rights to go to your professor and explain that your friend has asked you to share your work so she could plagiarise it, because there is a chance that she might decide to just take your work without asking and then have it end up with *you* being branded as the cheater, where your education is put at risk.\n\nYou have to protect yourself first and foremost. Why she's acting out isn't your business, and I get the frustration of working hard and seeing someone else just want to coast along to keep having fun.\n\nThe ones here saying \"mind your business\" haven't thought at all about the potential damage she could cause you. You need to be proactive when it comes to potential plagiarism in college/university. It might not even go further than a note taken to watch out for it, in any case, and then you'd still be safely covered.", "NTA. Let her figure it out herself. You owe her nothing. I hate people who think allowing this lazy behavior is okay. \n\nI personally would tell. Play stupid games. Win no/stupid prizes. \n\nI hate college kids who think they can act lazy, not do their work and make those who actually work hard, work harder. \n\nNo OP. I\u2019d sing like a canary.", "YWBTA. It is frustrating that she does nothing on her study while you study hard. But that is her problem. You just tell her no when she wants to copy your work. That is all you can do. Sooner or later she will not pass a class or get in trouble herself. Don\u2019t nudge her into that direction by telling on her. That is immature. Just don\u2019t give her your homework and focus on yourself.", "YWBTA. You\u2019re not her counsellor or her teacher. If she cheats it doesn\u2019t affect you at all. The moment her actions affect you, then you can do something about it. Complain about not sleeping, set rules, move out, whatever you want. But just \u201cplaning to do something\u201d doesn\u2019t concern you at all. It won\u2019t affect your schooling, your grades or your learning. It just seems like an act of revenge. Sure, don\u2019t let her copy your answers, but whatever she does with her own life is her own business, even if she\u2019s self-destroying. A friend would offer help with whatever she\u2019s going through. I can also tell that you\u2019re upset it\u2019s not fair that she can (potentially) pass with cheating while you\u2019re actually doing the work. Well life isn\u2019t fair, sometimes not everyone gets the same deal. Like if you\u2019re great at maths and can easily get a 100% without studying while someone has to study a whole week just to get one answer", "YWBTA. You have to recognize that while being dirty and obnoxious as a roommate are bothering you and possibly harming you, the potential cheating has absolutely nothing to do with you. You just want revenge and an outlet for your judgement. But the behaviors you\u2019re upset about wouldn\u2019t even bother you if you two weren\u2019t living together. So the solution isn\u2019t to try and get them kicked out of school. The solution is to move out. \n\nAlso if someone comes to you and asks you for help to cheat it\u2019s because they trust you. You know this. If you truly had such high moral standards, you simply would have said at the time that you want nothing to do with a violation of academic integrity. Instead, you\u2019ve turned yourself into some sort of informant for the prof for the express purpose of exposing your own roommate for actions taken in the privacy of their own space. That\u2019s pretty low and an AH move unto itself. \n\n.", "YTA if you turn her in. Try paying attention to your own work instead of hyperfocusing on her. What she does is none of your business.

Problem solved.", "It is OPs business. If her work is copied they will both suffer. That's how it works.", "And if she's caught with OP's papers, OP will get punished too. NTA", "All that is irrelevant if OP gets dismissed.", "Except it *is* their business if the roommate has cheated off of them. They could get in serious trouble (like getting kicked out themselves) if they \"help\" the cheater because they would be seen as a cheater themselves. It wouldn't necessarily matter if OP didnt do it willingly as that can ve difficult to prove. This is a big deal to universities.", "Trusting you can get OP academically dismissed if the roomie steals her work and OP has no prior defense.

Coz world will never be fair, and at some point the weight will be too much to bear in my experience.\n\nBut also generally fixing what\u2019s wrong in front of your eyes is not by default wrong. People just think you shouldn\u2019t put things right, if it affects people negatively? But then again, where do you draw the line? Everything there is highly subjective.\n\nWhat\u2019s most important is, that you can live with yourself and your decision. I wouldn\u2019t let my own conscious be affected by other peoples opinions, if made up my mind, as I have to live with that. Likewise I should be sure with my decision, as eventually you can\u2019t reverse it.\n\nLike in this scenario I personally would rat her out too, as my morale codex is quite broken.\nBut I don\u2019t know her, nor her problems, so maybe one day I learned the reasons for her behaviour and might regret my decision.\nMaybe a compromise would be to gather and secure evidence, and give her a chance to come clean, get help, improve her situation, and only rat her out if she keeps cheating?\n\nBut in the end: you yourself decide what you can live with and what not.", "How is she protecting herself by ratting out her roommate?"]}
