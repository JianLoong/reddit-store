I don't pick people who  tend to copy off of others for their own success because at the end of the day it boils down to how little respect they truly have for someone else's hard work. \n\nIt's showing that your friend is going through a downward spiral right now so if possible could you sit her down and talk to her about it in the most non confrontational way possible. I tend to be the sort of person that doesn't like having others around when I break down, but I do somehow lend help when they do. \n\nIf possible, please speak with your friend calmly and have a girls night. If she still happens to have a problem or doesn't exactly give you a proper reason such as depression, burden, burnout syndrome etc, then do remind her that you're supposed to be sharing responsibility and that you might be there now but there's no telling if you both will walk down different paths in the future. \n\nYou feel disrespected when she wants credit for work you've been doing on your own. Independence comes with responsibility, a lot of people go through difficult times alone, this is an opportunity for the two of you to grow together and for her to evolve as a person and understand her boundaries better. \n\nI will not call you an AH because honestly, no matter how close I am with someone the moment they talk about copying off of me, I cut them out and lose respect for them immediately. Despite whatever she's going through that's no reason to drag both of you into trouble with professors (considering how strict they tend to be about plagiarism) \n\nRemind her that your there to help but only if she wants to help herself otherwise, please distance yourself from her so as to not create further resentment and harsh feelings between the both of you.", "There's a step to go before you commit to that. Personally I would seek revenge 1st. Put a lock on your door and everytime you go out play a nursery rhyme on repeat, nice and loud. Make sure sleep is disturbed and it will drive them nuts. \n\nMaybe buy some duck tape and put it down the middle of the living room and only clean 1 side. Make a point of making them look like a tit. Dirty tampons left in the bathroom, just before their friends come round. Make their lives a misery, if they don't get the point then turn your \"friend\" in.", "ESH yes, she sucks, tell her to get help and request to not live together anymore.\n\nYou don't need to report her, she's failing on her own. Let her learn from her own mistakes instead of trying to turn her in. \n\nI understand you're bitter about the situation, but you turning her in for cheating  is clearly revenge and not ok, it's you betraying her.", "You say she is your friend and she's self destructing. Why aren't you doing anything to find out why she is self destructing? Trying to get her help? Anything could have happened to cause this change in behavior and instead of being an actual friend you're using cheating as an excuse to get rid of her so you don't have to deal with it anymore.  \nYTA and a bad friend.", "YWBTA \nYou aren\u2019t the academic police.  \nAnd if you are considering this, you aren\u2019t a friend.\nSounds like she annoys you in a variety of ways and this would be a convenient way to get them out of your life.\nLet them reap what they (do not) sow.\nJust don\u2019t live together. No need to burn down her life.", "YwNBTA.. Here's why.. If you give her your work, depending on the academic policies at your school,  most schools allow for kicking out the students who abet others in cheating. You have an academic responsibility to make sure you don't share your work with anyone else, especially if you know that they are going to cheat.\n\n\n\nYou don't need to rat her out, but you do need to cover your ass, at the very least. Don't give her your stuff..", "You aren\u2019t responsible for her, I would move out if possible, or if it is a college dorm complain to the dorm manager. You have a right to your rest.

Distance yourself from her, move out - you have plenty you can do on your own.", "YWBTA - Put aside your judgemental attitude and understand that it's not your problem. \n\nYou have some valid complaints, but cheating ain't one.", "Don't help her, but don't turn her in unless you have substantial evidence that she is cheating. I'm going to go NTA because it is really sucks to watch someone who doesn't care get the same reward, but in time, she will drop or flunk out.  \n\n\nI had shitty roommates in college. It's unfortunately part of the experience. Lesson here: Don't move in with friends. I moved in with my 2 best friends in college and resented the fuck out of them in 2 months. Once we split up our living situations, we got close again (after like 6 months of fall out). It's hardly ever a good idea.", "YWBTA\n\nIt seems like you might be motivated by revenge for her not pulling her weight domestically. This is understandable, but unhealthy imo.\n\nDon't give yourself the extra stress by putting yourself into a position where you make yourself responsible for someone else's growth as a person, or failure to grow as a person.\n\nFocus on your own work; her actions ultimately make no difference to your success, but this kind of slacking will always catch people up.", "NTA. Report it to cover your own ass in case she does steal your work. I hope you also find a different living situation quickly, too.", "YWBTA it's clear that she is having some issues. You don't know what is going on with her so stop assuming things. You say lazy but she could be depresses, and using alcohol and partying to cope. Why are you being so judgemental about her choices. Move out and live your life and also learn some empathy.", "[removed]", ">I am hoping she would get booted from the school and then would have no reason to live with me anymore, but that's neither here nor there. She doesn't deserve to be in class if she's not committed to it.\n\nYTA and YWBTA.\n\nThis part especially comes off as elitist, and even petty. \n\nIs she an AH for leaving all the housework to you? Yes.\n\nIs she an AH for being disruptive on school days? Yes.\n\nAre you well within your rights not to let her copy off of you? Yes.\n\nEverything else you've mentioned frankly doesn't concern you. You can ask to switch rooms or roommates. That's fine.\n\nGetting booted from school when she's clearly having an unhealthy relationship with herself is hardly a fair outcome. Why would you want that for her? The work you put in won't be of less quality just because she isn't as hardworking. Your grades won't be affected at all. And where do you draw the line anyway with that kind of thinking? Is everyone who's not getting straight As also undeserving to be there? What about those who don't get a 100% on their assignments? Or are we just supposed to kick out those that get Cs or Ds because they're not dedicated enough?", "Lol sorry but if you see someoe take something that's not theirs do you all just say nothing. This is partly what's fcked up with society, people do shit that's just wrong and don't get called out for it. There are plenty of situations I'd not mind Mt own business. If she isn't putting in the work like the rest of the students and wants to cheat then she can deal with the consequences. Doesn't deserve to be there if she's going to cheat. She's grown and knows better.", "YWBTAH, I 100% understand your frustrations but tattling won't help anyone. It would just be vindictive for the sake of being vindictive. \n\nAbsolutely maintain your boundary of not helping her with school in any way. Change your living situation asap. Drop her friendship all together if that feels right. \n\nIt's not your business what happens between her and the school, though. Only what happens between you and her.", "[deleted]", "Have her read this very note and see if it wakes her up.  It must be so incredibly frustrating and maddening for you.

About about how things have changed and it's affecting your life at the home y'all share? And expressed your unwillingness to contribute to her cheating? I'd do that first if you haven't. Just explain that you know you're in college and everyone is dealing with their freedom differently but that you have to draw the line when you feel you can't relax in your own home. I'd also explain that you aren't comfortable with cheating because ultimately it won't be beneficial to her and because you run the risk of getting in trouble as well.\n\nAlso, when is the lease up?\n\nETA: Either way, the solution isn't turning her in. I think you need to consider your motives and also know that it will catch up with her, one way or another. I'd let that play out and keep a clear conscience. Also, if you've willingly (even if begrudgingly) participated in any way, you could end up in a lot of trouble too.", "YWBTA. Your friend's actions are going to have consequences regardless. No need to snitch. If you don't want to live with her any more, seek out a new living situation. And then put her out of your mind.", "YWBTA.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, I see this all the time. Someone gets to a breaking point, then all of a sudden the person they\u2019re talking about has somehow become a completely irredeemable person in every way, almost as a means of justifying some crazy retaliatory behavior.\n\nHer being messy has nothing to do with her cheating. But you added it, why? \n\nSay no to giving her your papers, and stay in your lane. Move out, live your life. Don\u2019t worry about hers.", "I strongly advise you to make sure she does not have access to your work while you aren\u2019t in the home. I know someone who almost got kicked out of college because her friend had stolen papers from her computer when she wasn\u2019t in the room. I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone but make sure she doesn\u2019t get you in trouble.\n\nETA: If she is lazy then she will probably get caught when cheating.", "Um, apparently I\u2019m going against the grain here, but NTA. I had a friend whose roommate was just like this. He stole answers from my friend and nearly got both of them kicked out of school. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s copying OP behind her back. Colleges take plagiarism extremely seriously and you should protect yourself. Without evidence the school may not do anything but by informing them you could save yourself trouble down the line.

You can't report her intentions. \n\nCheaters really piss me off.", "YWBTA - No need to get involved with the cheating. Rather than judging her though you could ask if she needs help. That would be the human thing to do.", "YTA. You don't get to decide if someone is worthy of being in school. that's not your place at all. Grow up. Move out and move on.", "YTA - it sounds like you just want to turn her in to get back at her for how she acts at home. Just move out when you can and let it be. Sometimes friends can\u2019t live together which is fine, but if you do this you will burn that bridge and destroy her chance of ever going to college.", "YTA\n\nShe hasn't done anything yet. So you know nothing. \n\nIf you concretely know she's cheating that's one thing, but  'plans' mean nothing.", "NTA. It's perfectly within your rights to go to your professor and explain that your friend has asked you to share your work so she could plagiarise it, because there is a chance that she might decide to just take your work without asking and then have it end up with *you* being branded as the cheater, where your education is put at risk.\n\nYou have to protect yourself first and foremost. Why she's acting out isn't your business, and I get the frustration of working hard and seeing someone else just want to coast along to keep having fun.\n\nThe ones here saying \"mind your business\" haven't thought at all about the potential damage she could cause you. You need to be proactive when it comes to potential plagiarism in college/university. It might not even go further than a note taken to watch out for it, in any case, and then you'd still be safely covered.", "NTA. Let her figure it out herself. You owe her nothing. I hate people who think allowing this lazy behavior is okay. \n\nI personally would tell. Play stupid games. Win no/stupid prizes. \n\nI hate college kids who think they can act lazy, not do their work and make those who actually work hard, work harder. \n\nNo OP. I\u2019d sing like a canary.", "YWBTA. It is frustrating that she does nothing on her study while you study hard. But that is her problem. You just tell her no when she wants to copy your work. That is all you can do. Sooner or later she will not pass a class or get in trouble herself. Don\u2019t nudge her into that direction by telling on her. That is immature. Just don\u2019t give her your homework and focus on yourself.", "YWBTA. You\u2019re not her counsellor or her teacher. If she cheats it doesn\u2019t affect you at all. The moment her actions affect you, then you can do something about it. Complain about not sleeping, set rules, move out, whatever you want. But just \u201cplaning to do something\u201d doesn\u2019t concern you at all. It won\u2019t affect your schooling, your grades or your learning. It just seems like an act of revenge. Sure, don\u2019t let her copy your answers, but whatever she does with her own life is her own business, even if she\u2019s self-destroying. A friend would offer help with whatever she\u2019s going through. I can also tell that you\u2019re upset it\u2019s not fair that she can (potentially) pass with cheating while you\u2019re actually doing the work. Well life isn\u2019t fair, sometimes not everyone gets the same deal. Like if you\u2019re great at maths and can easily get a 100% without studying while someone has to study a whole week just to get one answer", "YWBTA. You have to recognize that while being dirty and obnoxious as a roommate are bothering you and possibly harming you, the potential cheating has absolutely nothing to do with you. You just want revenge and an outlet for your judgement. But the behaviors you\u2019re upset about wouldn\u2019t even bother you if you two weren\u2019t living together. So the solution isn\u2019t to try and get them kicked out of school. The solution is to move out. \n\nAlso if someone comes to you and asks you for help to cheat it\u2019s because they trust you. You know this. If you truly had such high moral standards, you simply would have said at the time that you want nothing to do with a violation of academic integrity. Instead, you\u2019ve turned yourself into some sort of informant for the prof for the express purpose of exposing your own roommate for actions taken in the privacy of their own space. That\u2019s pretty low and an AH move unto itself. \n\n.", "YTA if you turn her in. Try paying attention to your own work instead of hyperfocusing on her. What she does is none of your business.

Now, it seems like she's done a 180: she's not pulling her weight around the house, she's staying up late and disregarding your schedule, she's showing up to class hung over, her grades are slipping to the point that she's looking for a quick fix as opposed to buckling down and doing the work.\n\nIf not an alcohol problem, she's at the very least, handling some sort of issue or issues, atrociously and it's hurting her and those around her.\n\nYou *would* be the asshole if you didn't try to have a conversation about what happened to her because this doesn't sound like the person you moved in with. This is an opportunity to not just fix things, but to also be there for someone you obviously once considered a friend.", "YWBTA - just leave it alone OP, it's clear you're becoming resentful of this person. I used to be exactly like this when I was in college and you know what I learned in the end.... who cares? In the end of the day of your whole thing you're going to leave and do whatever you want with your life and she is going to do whatever she wants to do with her life (assuming she passes).

Her friend asked to copy her answers, she said no. Her involvement ended there (with no wrongdoing on her part).

Why interfere when it is going to affect your homelife? She is going to fail her education on her own anyway. I get the feeling that it is unfair. But I still think you should not interfere when it is not hurting your own education.", "I agree. But she should protect her work by not letting her friend copy her work. If she tells her no and she still copies without permission then you have a point to make with the teacher. If she asks, OP tells her no and that is that then there is no reason to tell the teacher. Then it is just because you don\u2019t want her to pass with minimal effort while you try your hardest. Then it is not because you are a victim of plagiarism but because you don\u2019t want her to pass with minimal effort.\n\nIf I would live in a house with someone who is not working as hard I would still not tell the teacher because it is her own problem. If you are not doing the work you should then Sooner or later she will fail classes. That is on her. \n\nIf you tell on her then she might take it out on you at home.

In fact, it seems like the roommate already has moved on and has a plan b by paying someone (presumably not OP) for answers. If she has the means to pay someone, in what world does she need to then go and steal the answers/work from OP? Nowhere does OP even suggest that the roommate would go to those lengths, and I have no doubt that OP would have mentioned it since they seem not to think highly of this person as it is and are more than happy to see them out of their life. If this was a real concern for OP, they would have mentioned it. Instead they\u2019ve already admitted the reason they want to turn their roommate in is so that they no longer have to live together and because OP believes the roommate doesn\u2019t deserve to be there.", "I'm also a professor and I agree with all parts of this recommendation, especially the \"go in person\" part.", "This should be the top comment!!!

If nothing improves then obviously they took advantage of that kindness, and you shouldn\u2019t let that happen again.

Both parties are seen as equally at fault unless one can prove they didn't do it. OP has no proof unless she says something before it happens. After the fact it's too late. \n\nLook at it from the administration's standpoint: They're roommates, they're friends, one's grades are slipping, it's natural for her friend with good grades to want to help. That's the reasoning they follow. OP has no proof she didn't share willingly so she's assumed to be guilty.

Anecdotally I can say that the majority of my classmates from undergrad would have had little to no issue with copying homework answers, particularly for assignments/classes that weren't very important, but I'd bet that almost all of them wouldn't even think about stealing answers from someone. Regardless, most assignments are digital now, so password protecting your pc should be enough to protect against that anyway.", "I\u2019m guessing most, if not all of their class work is done digitally so I don\u2019t know how she would steal her friend\u2019s work without logging in to her computer and such.", "But if you are looking at it from the point of view  where the administration will see them both at fault no matter what, then telling in advance still won\u2019t help OP. It could genuinely harm OP. Let\u2019s say roommate has already stolen something without OP\u2019s knowledge and hands it in. Now OP has told them that she is cheating and they look into her and finds the plagiarism and OP is dragged into it.

Most assignments were turned in digitally back when I went to college 12 years ago, and when I recently went back to change careers, it\u2019s been even more so digitized.

I told the class that I knew it was taken and that I had an electronic copy of the original and I would be grading this lab very carefully and any similarity to the stolen one would be handed over immediately.

A friend copied my answers once, we got a 0 on the exam. Just lovely", "It does, but saying nothing gives no protection. It at least sets the date for future assignments while she's living there and would give a reasonable degree of protection for recent ones. We're no longer in the age of hand- and type-written reports so if someone gets into your computer it's not an easy thing to pinpoint what was taken. The proof of that is in the similarity and if OP reported that her work was at risk that should give a measure of protection.", "If the roommate steals her work and uses it and OP hasn't told the prof first, the assumption is she shared it willingly.

I told my prof about this and he may have talked to her about it but he asked me to redo an alternative assignment on top of what I had already done because I was liable for \u201cgiving\u201d the answers, she had no consequences as far as I know (she remained in school graduated with honors).

It has nothing to do with you, you already refused to let her copy from you so that's about it. Sounds like this living situation isn't working out so find a new place or ask her to move out and you'll never have to deal with her again outside of class.", "So when op's friend throws op under the bus when they do copy ops work where was the friendship then? Naw op needs better friends", "Glad to see someone, especially who knows what they're talking about, mention proof. That was the biggest factor in me saying not to turn her in based solely on the facts in OP. It seems no form of cheating has even occurred yet and there's zero proof of roommate's ask/OP's denial. I don't see any benefit on involving the university at this stage. The reporting seems to mostly stem from resentment from a friendship gone sour and a bad living situation, not from wanting to do the right thing. With those motives and OP being stuck under the same roof, reporting roommate's question (not even actual cheating) without any proof seems unproductive at best. \n\nETA: It's not an AH move but it wouldn't result in anything substantial, including this carte blanche everyone seems certain the university would grant to OP for any and all times when she doesn't protect her work from her roommate in the future. The roommate who OP would have acknowledged, on record, as being a liability.", "I already replied to the comment above but the schools I've gone to require proof. Everything can't be hearsay and one person's word can't be valued more than another's if there's no history of infractions or dishonesty. If no cheating has actually occurred yet and OP turns roommate in, how much weight can her word truly carry? Even if roommate eventually steals from OP, what keeps the roommate from saying she gave it to me willingly but got mad about something else/got paranoid/felt guilty and tried to get ahead of it? If the college is going to believe hearsay, where do they draw the line? Or if OP goes on record saying it's a potential problem, wouldn't it almost look worse if they left their work where it could be stolen by the roommate? Why would the university feel more sympathy for someone who acknowledged the risk but didn't mitigate said risk than they would for someone who, understandably, believed their private space was private and trusted their friend/roommate?\n\nI don't think any of it is good but I wouldn't recommend stirring the pot in a situation where nothing has technically even happened yet, you have zero proof, and you currently live with the person and used to be friends with them. Especially if it's a situation that will likely play itself out anyway either by the roommate failing out or there coming a time when there actually IS proof. I think OP should distance themselves as much and as soon as possible and remain adamant in not wanting to share answers, in writing if possible. I don't OP they would be the asshole if they turned her in but I just can't make sense of the risk vs reward when, again, there is zero proof and zero actual cheating so far.", "Which university is it? I didn't see that mentioned?\n\nI also didn't see where OP said roommate had already cheated. If she has and OP has proof, sure, I can see turning her in. But I don't really see the benefit of turning her in for asking to which OP said no. Or roommate saying she's going to get them from someone else. Unless roommate has actually done it and/or OP has evidence of her saying this, I feel like OP could be dragging herself into something that would be one person's word against another over something that hasn't even happened yet. I see people arguing that OP would be protecting herself by staying ahead of it, saying her work could be stolen without her consent, but what if this has already happened? Where's the proof? If school comes to roommate and says \"Someone has reported that you asked to copy their answers\", roommate may be able to easily know that was OP and could say it was the other way around. Or just say it never happened and OP wants her kicked out. Or if roommate had gotten answers from someone else but claimed she got them from OP? Even if OP had violated some other unrelated policy, however minor, roommate could bring that up. They're friends so roommate could also pull anything from OP's personal life or past. Maybe she's never done one single thing wrong. I don't know a ton of college kids like that but I guess it's possible. \n\nI understand the argument but with zero proof of anything (even the ask) and zero indication that cheating has actually taken place, I wouldn't stir the pot or insert myself into a situation that will inevitably play itself out when roommate fails out or actually cheats and leaves proof. Otherwise, this could just start a huge battle with someone OP shares a home with. And for what? I'm not sure where y'all went to school but at my high school and at both universities I attended, you need proof that someone cheated or at least that they asked. They wouldn't have disciplined or expelled someone based solely on hearsay. \n\nMy high school actually tried and there was massive backlash involving a lawyer and counter accusations regarding the person that originally said something as well as successful efforts to retaliate in ways that weren't against policy and/or were impossible to prove. The original accuser  wasn't squeaky clean perfect, but they were as close as any high school student I knew. And everyone has personal stuff or things they wouldn't want everyone to know about. No one got expelled from the original incident and this was just high school but it was a huge mess for the person who originally reported with no proof. After all that, less than 2 months later, the person originally accused was caught pulling up a website to cheat during an exam and was promptly expelled.", "Lmaoooo ok\nGetting heated huh", "I think I might have forgotten what I might have wrote, but do you think she should notify the teachers beforehand about plagiarism? I'm starting think that might be better, just to be on the safe side, I suppose I'm concerned if this might rock their already rocky relationship, especially if the teachers start becoming overtly cautious towards the roommate, But It might be this or plagiarism? I don't think I have too much problems with either, again I'm not aware if I said anything about this in my original comment (which you replied to) what's your stance? Should Op tell the teachers, or should she Not? I hope this doesn't come across unfriendly, I'm genuinely curious I swear, and don't mean to make anyone uncomfortable.", "And lock up your work.", "Yesterday there was another post about a 17 y/o asking if she should tell her parents that her 15 y/o brother was lying to his parents about his paychecks and almost every single comment was YTA, a lot of them calling her a snitch or worse (she hadn't even told yet, it was a \"WIBTA if\" question).\n\nWonder where all those people are today. There's only a few comments on here saying \"don't snitch\" and they've mostly been downvoted.", "I don't know OP's university. Academic dishonesty policies are in place at every accredited institution of higher learning and the penalties are severe. The point in OP mentioning it was not to get the roommate expelled. It was to put the prof on notice that OP had been approached to share answers and papers. OP lives with this person and while she is taking steps to secure her work she is concerned that until she can move this person may gain access to her materials. So, if something turns out to be suspiciously similar it was not due to OP voluntarily sharing.\n\nWithout getting ahead of it, it will be assumed that OP shared and will have to prove she didn't. Not an easy thing. If OP waits the only proof will be two nearly identical assignments and by then it's too late. This puts the prof on notice that it's a possibility and if it does happen OP is protected. \n\nAcademic dismissal is no joke. The threat of bringing up any other infraction pales in comparison.\n\nFWIW as part of our academic dishonesty policy we were told to encourage students to be aware, protect their assignments and report if anything turns up missing or if they thought it might. That way we had an inkling that something may happen. I had it happen once. I addressed the class and said I'd be grading that assignment with particular care. We had our suspicions but no proof. Nothing came of it but the student whose work was taken would not have been the one in trouble for cheating.", "I think OP should inform the profs that the roommate had asked for answers and to copy her papers. Reason being is they live together and if the roomie can't find someone to pay for the answers/papers she may resort to lifting OP's work.\n\nIf roomie does steal and OP hasn't said anything the assumption will be OP voluntarily shared her work and she'd have to prove she didn't. That's tough. If she can't then OP will suffer the consequences. The obligation is to protect your work and to inform the administration of anything sketchy if you want to protect yourself.\n\nNo worries, you're perfectly fine!", "The roommate cheating actually can potentially affect a lot more people than the young brother wanting to keep more cash. Imagine an academic cheater finishing a degree say in engineering or medicine and then getting a job where their decisions and performance actually impact people's lives.\n\nThat brother is a family member for life, and unless he already knows how to do his own taxes, his secret earnings will come out at some point. OP never has to talk with her roommate again if she so chooses. That roommate has the potential to ruin OP's own record and future employment.", "If if if", "Nta but check in with her. I have no tolerance for cheating and you should protect yourself. Check in though. If this is a change that occurred I\u2019d be worried that something happened to make her deteriorate like this.

If I have two students submit identical work, all I know is both of them are cheating. I don't know who is copying off who and I don't really have a reason to trust whoever points fingers. \n\nIn other words, if you continue to help her, YOUR ass is also in the academic dishonesty sling. \n\nLet's...let's not go there.  \n\nOr if you do, do it now as a pre-emptive situation but be aware that you are going to have to really suck it up if you've at any point already helped her with work.  Because you're gonna have to come TOTALLY clean to those profs, meaning admit that you gave unauthorized aid to another student (check your school's honor code, btw), throw yourself on their mercy and hope for the best.  That...might not be something you're comfortable with. \n\nRather than turn her in for cheating, just...don't help her.  Get creative, do whatever you have to do to not help her...that way. \n\nEither choice YWNBTA\n\nIt sounds like she's decompensating in some way and that needs to be addressed.

When someone uses Chegg on a test at a school that price gouges thousands for tuition i keep my mouth shut.

How awful for the student who didn\u2019t actually do anything wrong!", "Yea that's fair, and if I seen someone stealing food I'm going to assume they need it. Stealing shit that's not a need I will say something, stealing personal property I will say something and if someone cheats on a test I'd say something. The reason in this case I would say something is probably because of ny own moral compass, she's in a position many would love to be in but can't yet she's cheating her way through. I have a huge issue with dishonesty so I'd say something but it strait up tell her if she cheats I will speak up.", "Simply telling her no to copying her work is enough. She doesn\u2019t have to go scorched earth and try to get her expelled (and do so in a way that will make her untouchable to other colleges). She asked for something stupid.

But she hasn\u2019t, and the college is likely to just say \u201cshe\u2019s not done anything wrong yet\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s relying on OP for everything, and feels entitled to this as a handout; let her deal with the consequences when that easy ride she is expecting is denied to her. These institutions have anti-plagiarism measures that will catch this kind of thing, but I think putting yourself into a position of responsibility with people like this only affects you negatively.", "This is a great plan!", "I'm also a professor and this is 100% correct.", "You said the university had strict policies, which is why I thought you knew. I know every university has strict policies on cheating and plagiarism. I am not sure on the average policy on acting on hearsay that one student asked another student to copy their answers and that student said no. If there was proof, I understand that the university could act on that. \n\nIf the ultimate goal is the university taking note, my thinking was that acknowledging the risk on record yet OP allowing it to happen, however careful she claimed to be, could be seen as worse or at least less sympathetic than OP saying her work was stolen by a friend/roommate she trusted (IF OP ever allows this to happen). If the university takes the stance that OP is just as guilty, even if her room is broken into and laptop hacked, why would her acknowledging the risk beforehand make them change their mind? And if OP doesn't say anything and eventually has her work stolen, why do you assume the university will take the roommate's word as gospel when she accuses OP of being a willing participant? It seems that you're arguing that by making a report now, OP will be definitively proving, in the eyes of the university, that she could never be convinced to share her work voluntarily in the future. And that, in the event that her work is stolen, the university will now hold OP less accountable than they would any other careful, innocent student who had no reason to be suspicious of their friend and roommate. I understand where you're coming from but I think it's a lot to assume that reporting now would ensure OP's full protection in the future. To me, it seems a very thin veil of protection and not worth the risk of backlash from the roommate.\n\nI really do see what you're saying but I am looking at risk vs reward when there's no proof of any interaction and no cheating has actually occurred. I'm also, admittedly, taking into account the full post and it seems like OP's motives are based on anger and resentment and not on doing the right thing. I don't think a lot of good can come from acting on those feelings, especially when, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, I see no indication that OP can prove the interaction ever took place or that any academic dishonesty has occurred. It's very possible that the university will be able to see this for what it is: an uncorroborated statement made by a frustrated roommate who is there to get her roommate in trouble, not to do the right thing and honor policies or even to protect herself. \n\nAlso, I didn't mention other infractions as a comparison to academic dismissal or even to plagiarism. I compared hypothetical infractions by OP, which roommate/friend may have evidence of, to what is actually mentioned in the post: hearsay accusation of one student asking to copy another student's work and being denied. If a cop pulls me over for clocking me going 10 over in a school zone but I argue that the day before, in the same school zone, my friend was drunk going 30 over on a suspended license while texting, but I have no proof, who is getting a ticket? The infraction doesn't matter. Proof does. OP has none.", "Yeah but if the friend decided to copy without permission they both go down. Where's the friendship there?", "And if she steals OP's work and OP hasn't said anything when they both get called up before the review board how is OP to prove she didn't share her work with her friend voluntarily? Because that will happen and OP will be in as much trouble as the roomie.\n\nThat's why we told our students to report suspicious activity. CYA It is not brushed aside by any means. The student isn't reprimanded for an accusation but we were very careful about grading their work from then on.", "NTA.

You're right she hasn't done it yet but put someone in a desperate enough situation. That idea will sound really good. So in academia, being caught of plagiarism is very serious and will punish both. Unless the roommate throws op under the bus first which is a possibility. So with the very real chance of plagiarism(the roommate already floated the idea) it's actually in the realm of possibility.  So if and or when the roommate does it.

In which case, the roommate probably wouldn't get caught and all these PROTECT YOURSELF! arguments aren't really relevant. These arguments are also based on the assumption that the seemingly lazy, disinterested party girl is also a tech genius who is both willing and able to hack into OP's computer and steal answers in the first place. The same roommate who obviously feels there is enough of a friendship/enough trust left to ask OP for her answers and, when denied, divulge her backup plan: paying for the answers. All while OP, who seems to hate her roommate at this point, still sees enough good in her roommate that this threat hasn't even occurred to her. \n\nAlso everyone is acting like OP is wanting to do this to protect herself or because she feels she has a moral obligation to do so. She's pissed off and wants to get her ex-friend kicked out of college so she doesn't have to tell her they can't live together anymore. I've even seen multiple people say that she needs to go express her concern that her roommate will steal from her. OP never said she had that concern. So all these morally superior people want OP to go to her professor and...lie? \n\nThis post, more than any other on this sub, is making me feel truly insane. There's so much that could go wrong by someone, who is clearly pissed off and seeking retaliation, turning in a friend/roommate, whom they still share a home with, for merely ASKING to share answers. A conversation that OP doesn't even have proof of. For what \"benefit\"? To protect OP from the roommate potentially ditching her plan B (paying someone) and hacking into OP's computer to steal answers AND those answers being obvious enough for roommate to get caught AND roommate throwing OP under the bus IF she gets caught? AND the university choosing to take the roommates word over OP's? Or, if they do believe OP didn't participate, the university says, \"hey, so we have a university policy that says when a student's work is stolen, even if they are totally innocent and someone enters their private room and steals it, we have to hold them equally responsible. But, because you told us that you were concerned about this happening and still didn't do enough to prevent it, we will give you a freebie!\" Am I taking crazy pills?!
