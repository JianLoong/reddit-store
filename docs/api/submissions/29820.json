There was no reason for that person to sit in that seat if they hadn\u2019t reserved it. They took down all the details and will be escalating this to the drivers\u2019 manager.

No they can not resell the seats as you have purchased them already and they have no way onboard to sell or refund tickets.\n\nIf they\u2019re dragging their feet or refusing to do anything then tell them you\u2019ll take it to trading standards and see what they think about the situation - they\u2019ll prefer to pay you than eat the fines they\u2019ll get.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes, the rule sucks, but unfortunately nothing you can do about it and not the drives fault for the policy", "I did include that in the complaint but annoyed this has happened in the first place :/", "Did you get a refund too?", "I just commented before realising this update. Yay!

That you were even denied to pick which one. Next time get that solo seat in first class. Last two times I visited UK I did that and it was awesome. Got it from a discount site. So didn't pay much more for it.", "Thanks! Unfortunately no first class on these coaches. You can pay to reserve any of the seats in the first few rows and the rest is just a free for all. But will definitely mention the fact they didn\u2019t let me choose the seat even!", "And NTA", "Have you tried FlixBus at all they are newish to the uk I\u2019ve used them from Glasgow a couple times anyway you can pay a bit extra specifically to have nobody sat next to you \n\nSounds like the same thing as what you did but clearly for the purpose of having an empty seat next to you, so I don\u2019t think any drivers would give you hassle !\n\nEditing to add NTA", "Added an update in the comments but got my refund and then some!
