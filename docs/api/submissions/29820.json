There was no reason for that person to sit in that seat if they hadn\u2019t reserved it. They took down all the details and will be escalating this to the drivers\u2019 manager.

Yay! Very happy that you got this outcome!", "Tried that as well saying it was initially booked for a friend and they said \u2018Well they\u2019re not here\u2019!", "Just waiting on the customer service line to open at 8:00 and then I\u2019m on it!", "Thanks for the response!", "Ask for the extra window fee as well. That you were even denied to pick which one. Next time get that solo seat in first class. Last two times I visited UK I did that and it was awesome. Got it from a discount site. So didn't pay much more for it.", "Thanks! Unfortunately no first class on these coaches. You can pay to reserve any of the seats in the first few rows and the rest is just a free for all. But will definitely mention the fact they didn\u2019t let me choose the seat even!", "And NTA", "Have you tried FlixBus at all they are newish to the uk I\u2019ve used them from Glasgow a couple times anyway you can pay a bit extra specifically to have nobody sat next to you \n\nSounds like the same thing as what you did but clearly for the purpose of having an empty seat next to you, so I don\u2019t think any drivers would give you hassle !\n\nEditing to add NTA", "Added an update in the comments but got my refund and then some! Yay", "I've done this, it's usually avoid \u00a37.50 and I had the front seat all the way from Dundee to Birmingham and back - no motion sickness, but no phone charger either!", "Go, you!", "NTA. Also, why did the older lady have to sit right next to you? I\u2019d find that uncomfortable and weird. Those bus drivers were really rude along with the lady. Like, personal space anyone?!! You also bought the tickets!", "NTA\n\nYou paid for two seats.", "I prob would have made the ride intolerable for that lady the entire time.", "NTA. They basically stole your money by not giving you what you paid for.", "Nta", "Nta. Report them and get your money back.", "I'm glad you got a refund and I hope they actually do the training. NTA.", "My dad had the same experience a few years ago. Fuck National Express lol", "NTA.  \nYou paid for and reserved that seat. At the very least, you deserve a refund for the total cost of that seat.", "Report all AH\u2019s, yes please", "You are NTA!! get a refund!! I would not have been this kind! \ud83d\ude2d", "I'm not sure what's their policy and I don't feel like looking it up.\n\nMy local town bus company has policy like this. One seat per one person only and if you don't turn up on time your ticket will be reselled.\n\nBus drivers were assholes for not letting you choose which seat you want to sit in. As for the rest, I don't have enough information to tell who's in the right. It could be a legit policy. I guess NTA.", "NTA. Had a terrible experience with National Express a couple months ago. You paid for that seat and had perfectly valid reasons", "YTA. You can't do that and expect them not to give away the seat. They get a lot of people who book and don't show up, and people who hope to get on if they turn up on the day. The bus company rightly let's people sit in those free seats if people who have booked haven't turned up. They usually tick you off on the list as you arrive, so you would be recorded as ticked off on one seat, not two. I honestly can't believe how selfish you are wanting two seats all to yourself and forcing an old lady to get staff involved so she could sit down. Shame on you.\n\nYTA", "NTA, you paid for the seat it is yours, personally I would have refused and blocked her from sitting there and outright told the driver to go official so that I can formally complain about them trying to take my reserved seat.", "I know right?! It was so specific considering there were other seats around", "Haha, definitely plotted the whole ride but couldn\u2019t come up with anything that wouldn\u2019t get me kicked off the coach", "I\u2019m sorry your dad experienced that as well!  Will be avoiding National Express going forward", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that! Will honestly be avoiding them in the future", "From update we can see that it wasn't their policy but them being rude", "This is the worst take ever. How are you this dumb? They PAID for both seats. The old lady can get bent and f*ck off, along with the idiots driving the bus.", "So you are saying they can rightly double book seats and we shall be OK with it? What does booking mean to you exactly? You are also missing the point of the lady having lots of other seats to choose from.", "\"I honestly can't believe how selfish you are\"\n\nBy purchasing 2 tickets for themselves? What if two people HAD sat there? Well old lady can go to the other free available seats like OP said.\n\nBoth seats were paid for. With OP's money, now someone sat in OP's PAID FOR (reserved) seat. Which part are you unable to comprehend?", "This bus company doesn\u2019t allow people to get on the bus without tickets. You can\u2019t just show up on the day. The correct amount of seats are allocated, meaning there was a seat available for that lady. It just didn\u2019t have to be my reserved one. Either way, customer services did confirm the drivers were in the wrong.", "I did!!", "Thank you!", "INFO: when it became apparent you were going to lose this fight, why didn\u2019t you just Slide over to the window seat? I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong but it\u2019s unclear how they made you let her have that seat when she could\u2019ve had the outside seat and you\u2019d paid for it.", "Hooray!  \\o/", "That's brilliant! I'm so glad you got your money back!", "Good ending :)", "I was so annoyed with myself over this! I was caught off guard, I didn\u2019t even think when I took my stuff off and she sat down. But really I should have done what you said!", "Did you actually pay 2 tickets, or only reserve 2 seats on 1 ticket?", "Thanks!!", "Will definitely be trying that next time!", "Oh damn, flixbus is in the UK?? Fuck the megabus, with their \u201cyou can\u2019t get on one stop later than the station\u201d bullshit then!", "You have to purchase a ticket to reserve a seat so I paid for 2 :)", "Yaaass! Only for about a year or so I think, used them a couple time with all the train strikes, liked them a lot more than the megabus", "Thanks!!"]}
