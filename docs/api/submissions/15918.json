{"id": 15918, "submission_id": "1322zyy", "title": "WIBTA for complaining to customer service about deli worker.", "selftext": "Update: I did file the complaint. I didn\u2019t mention the eye roll and sigh. I simply said that he made a remark that indicated that he clearly did not understand the importance of why I made the request. I was told by management that every deli employee is trained on food allergies, celiacs, safe food handling and cross contamination protocols. The person I spoke to managed to name this person just by my complaint which tells me he could very likely use some continued reeducation on something he\u2019s been trained on. I\u2019m not entirely stoked but the fact that they were able to pinpoint who without me saying is telling. \n\nHere\u2019s the background. I do the grocery shopping in my house for my partner and I. My partner has celiacs. for those who don\u2019t know what that is, it\u2019s a serious autoimmune disease that is triggered from the consumption of gluten (found in wheat and some other grains). \n\nI was out getting us groceries and went to the deli counter for one of my items. The person who came to help me was just handling rolls. I ask him to please change his gloves and tell him the food is for someone with celiacs and they cannot have any wheat. the threshold for a celiacs flair is so low that simple cross contamination like that will trigger a reaction. The deli clerk loudly sighs and rolls his eyes. He does change his gloves. But a couple seconds later he goes \u201cya know I guess I get it, my brother is a germaphobe too\u201d, which I found to be pretty underhanded but that\u2019s more or less whatever. People have bad days. But the problem with this is it shows a clear lack of understanding of critical food safety and cross contamination protocols. Not really a big deal for a typical grocery worker, but for someone who\u2019s handling ingredients it seems like a pretty egregious oversight that this person 1) found issue with the request in the first place, and 2) expressed a fundamental lack of understanding of food safety for allergies (note - celiacs isn\u2019t an allergy but when it comes to cross contamination the same type of safety protocols apply, please excuse my brevity). \n\nI\u2019m struggling because at 32, I\u2019ve never filed a complaint about a service industry worker before. I\u2019ve worked retail and I know how much the work can suck. I empathize with that. But I\u2019m strongly considering it given the health implications involved in this particular instance. \n\nSo as the title states, WIBTA if I filed this complaint with customer service?\n\nETA - removed the word \u201craw\u201d before ingredients. There are no raw ingredients in question here.", "created_utc": 1682702105, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1322zyy/wibta_for_complaining_to_customer_service_about/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they hold those viewpoints, there is a high likelihood that they view safeguards to prevent such reactions as unnecessary, and have a high likelihood of ignoring them, which could get someone killed.

You would need a more rigorous channel to monitor what they eat. \n\nYour question regarding peanuts, shellfish or dairy is a different case. Ingredients are posted on the prepared food, or you ask the waitress or chef. If 1 mg of a peanut would bring someone to their knees, then they also  should be under far more strict monitoring than in a store deli. \n\nDo you really expect every service food worker to change their gloves for each and every customer so as to insure 100% purity down to the last crumb of food?\n\nThis is simply not realistic.\n\nI also agree with the other posts that you could have handled this better What if the person's boss interprets your criticism to make it seem worse than it was?

They can't get punished for failing to comply with the request, because they did comply with the request.

This has been weighing pretty heavily on me for a minute now. On one hand I\u2019ve never wanted to make a complaint about someone. On the other, not taking food handling seriously is a pretty major thing.", "No he in fact didn\u2019t have an understanding.

That in and of itself is a complete non issue to me. I said that in my post and in other comments. I have an issue with a fundamental lack of understanding regarding food safety and diet restrictions due to allergy or disease. Nothing more, nothing less.", "Edit to add - it looks like our friend here blocked me. Could anyone enlighten me with what he said in his reply before he decided to run and hide? \n\nBelieve it or not the threshold for an auto immune response to gluten for people with celiacs is in the micrograms. That being said, we have strict vetting protocols that we adhere to to ensure safety for my partner. It\u2019s no skin off our back if a restaurant can\u2019t accommodate that. A lot cannot and we just don\u2019t eat there. If a deli doesn\u2019t clean their slicers between uses we don\u2019t buy from there. There are ways to stay safe. \n\nAnd yes I absolutely expect a food service worker to change their gloves when asked. It\u2019s quite literally never an issue. The only issue here was an expressed lack of understanding of a component of this persons job that they are trained on by their employer. I went in to talk to this business and was told that yes, they are trained on all food allergies and food based auto immune diseases including celiacs. \n\nStill not sure what you mean by how I handled it. I was asking would I be the asshole, because I had not done it at the time of posting. I have since made the complaint. I dodged bringing up the initial attitude and I just mentioned his remark that indicated he didn\u2019t know something he was trained on. That\u2019s it. If someone cannot do their job, they need to be trained or get a job they can do. There are consequences to fucking up on your job. I hope his is that he gets retrained.", "No one got sick in this story. That\u2019s not the point.", "I get that you're saying, however, the store where the items were purchased would be *liable* for any damages to a customer due to negligence, or not following procedure. She doesn't have to report the person specifically, however, this issues shouldn't be brushed aside. \n\nShe also doesn't need to necessarily report to the store, but could easily just make a report to the health department to investigate. \n\nCross contamination is serious, and whomever the manager is, did not train that employee accordingly. However actions have consequences, even in food service work. \n\nCould she have explained that celiac disease was not a germaphobe thing and a disease, sure. Should management have gone over the procedure and ensure employees know the importance of following procedure to prevent cross contamination. \n\nWhy should an employee get a raise for not following procedure? There are specific rules for food handling that have to be inspected by the health department prior to opening. Restaurants typically get inspected once to twice a year, depending on how well you score. The sanitation grade isn't based food quality, but procedures. There is effort that needs to made to deserve a raise. \n\nIt's not even just about the gloves, did the worker ensure that slicer has been cleaned between different deli meat? Or between cheeses? Did they make sure the utensils they were using hadn't been cross contaminated?", "Ah OK - apologies, I may be being harder on this guy than he deserves. But I still think it's pretty bad he was so rude about it when OP has a legitimate allergy.", "So what are you complaining about ? Not his attitude ? Not that he changed his gloves ?

Do you?", "He's not trained to adhere to the levels of prevention that you are demanding. \n\nI do volunteer work in a kitchen that caters to the elderly. Believe me, we keep a very clean house and are very careful. But no way were we ever trained to the levels you require. You are asking a deli worker to be a registered nurse. \n\nSo yeah, YTA because you didn't come here to listen to us. You're just defending yourself and not budging.

If I had an issue with it I would have stated that as opposed to stating the exact opposite. Understanding cross contamination of foods that trigger allergies or auto immune disease is just as fundamental as using gloves.", "No, he's not an MD, a PA, a paramedic or an EMR.
