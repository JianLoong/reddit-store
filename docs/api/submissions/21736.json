On fight days he likes to invite some guys around for ribs and beers, we put our teens on devices and I aim to gave a couple of hours sewing or whatever. Unfortunately we have one friend who is not capable of leaving his wife at home, she comes along and pouts while the guys watch the fights until I take pity on her and come and socialise. It's got to the point now where i don't bother planning to do my own thing. My husband thinks i should ignore her and carry on with my plans as she was not invited, but I think that would be extremely rude. WIBTA if i just did my own thing?", "created_utc": 1688862446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14uk3n3/wibta_ignoring_an_uninvited_guest/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I\u2019m going to make a passive suggestion. Tell your husband you have plans outside of the house for the next 3-4 games. Leave before people show up. \u201cOh sorry. Suzie had something important she had to go do. She will be gone for a few hours.\u201d After a few games of you not being home she will probably stop coming. Then, for awhile mix it up. Be home for one game. Be gone for the next. If you are unpredictable she won\u2019t know when there will be company. It will disrupt you for a bit but eventually it should give you freedom. Maybe see about a glass mosaic place where you can work on a craft project for multiple visits.", "NTA, my old friend had an awful gf then fianc\u00e9 then wife, no ex-wife (thank god) and I couldn\u2019t stand her. But she didn\u2019t let him go anywhere without her, then she just complained and pouted the whole time. Eventually I had to just stop hanging out with him because I couldn\u2019t take her, I couldn\u2019t make myself be nice any longer and I didn\u2019t want him in the position to choose, like who\u2019s choosing a dude over a wife anyway? But anyho, those clingy miserable type need to stay home or do their own thing.", "Nta she not your guest . If you still entertain her every time she come your home this will be continue and you might can't do anything. Don't reward bad behaviour.", "NTA You could also find somewhere else to be for a while too, as husband is hosting the event; go visit relatives if you have any nearby, go for a spa visit, find a wine tasting event to uber to and back.... or lock yourself in your sewing room for  a couple of hours!", "NTAH. You didnt invite her, you dont need to babysit her. Maybe if you dont hang out with her, her husband will stop forcing her to come/she will stop demanding he bring her.", "NTA do your own thing and enjoy it. You are not an unpaid babysitter for an adult who can stay home and not go where they aren\u2019t invited and where they clearly don\u2019t really want to be. \n\nDoes she not have any friends or interests of her own?", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t change my plans for her. If I were you I would say hi but then say you are going to be sewing and she can either hang out with the boys or in your sewing room. Then it\u2019s her choice. You aren\u2019t there to entertain her. You could give her half your attention by chatting while sewing.", "YWNBTA", "NTA. You're not responsible for her insecurities.", "NTA - this is not a couples event, the guys are having a UFC afternoon. You are not a babysitter. If you enjoy her company, then that is fine. If you had wanted this time to yourself by all means, you should not feel guilty about setting boundaries and having some private time.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to entertain her but it would be nice of you to let her tag along with you if it's not an inconvenience. Maybe she has a hobby she could do while you sew or she could read or something?", "YWNBTA but your husband should be stepping up and telling his friend that he isn't being given a +1 invitation, and if he can't come alone, don't bother showing up. No one needs a pouting, univited guest tarnishing the mood, and you don't deserve to be burdened with intervening and entertaining her when you have things to do.", "YWNBTA \n\nI\u2019m not sure what exactly is meant by \u2018not capable\u2019 of leaving her at home but I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s a control thing. So selfish she\u2019s making herself miserable, it\u2019s almost humorous.\n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to make her feel comfortable at an event she isn\u2019t invited to. She sounds soul-sucking and don\u2019t let her do it to you, especially in your own home.", "This is pretty good, but your husband absolutely does not need to say \u201cSorry.\u201d", "I agree- I should point out I don't dislike her. I just have plans", "No, her husband is her hobby", "Still fine! My wife has people over or vise versa and we don\u2019t make our individual plans turn into full group plans. Sometimes it is because we both want to, but other times is just us and what we want to do.", "Stick you your plans. It\u2019s not your task to entertain her, and you don\u2019t want to enable her behavior. This is not your problem to solve.", "I am presuming shes not at all crafty? If so she could come and bring any project like embroidery or knitting or what not and you could just hang out \ud83d\ude04", "But *she* is not *your* hobby. NTA if you don't give up your free time to entertain an uninvited guest who keeps showing up.", "You are NTA"]}
