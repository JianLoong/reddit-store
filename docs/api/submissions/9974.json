Surely he can grasp that this was new information to you and you will need time to fully process the depth of his betrayal and how you feel about it, your relationship and him. After all, what do you have if you don\u2019t have trust? \n\nThe fact that he\u2019s being so flip about it like you should just get over it makes me wonder if he realizes just how seriously he breached your trust. It is unlikely he won\u2019t do it again. \n\nBe careful there. NTA.", "NTA! The chutzpah of him to guilt trip you!", "Kissing is getting physical. He is wrong if he thinks you should just forget and move on. He should thank his lucky stars he was not kicked out the door. Nta.", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t expect you to act like everything is just grand when he\u2019s the one who cheated. His loving actions should extend for the whole year, not just this corporate holiday.", "Ugh, being asked to do the performative romance that is Valentine's Day just days after learning of marital infidelity?  That sounds painful and exhausting. Honestly, the act of putting on everything-is-fine gave right now for dinner reservation might just push you further apart. NTA.", "Imo, NTA. You just found out your husband has been cheating on you and your emotions are still raw. You\u2019re not obliged to feel a certain way just because he apologized. Take all the time you need to feel better and decide if you want to forgive him or not.", "NTA. You're processing a betrayal, and that takes time. You have nothing to feel guilty about - he's starting to show a classic cheater behavior in which the cheater gets sick of being repentant and starts blaming their partner for not forgiving them.\n\nIf you feel this marriage is worth saving, then I highly recommend counseling/therapy. I'm not an expert or anything, but I think both couples counseling and individual counseling for you would be good ideas. Good luck!", "NTA. He's cheating on you and expects you to go on as usual? He can't have it both ways.", "TIL that some people don't consider kissing physically cheating.", "NTA, but I don't envision this relationship continuing without some serious adjustments to expectations. He sounds like he thinks he apologized and that's all that needed to happen. You clearly don't feel the same. Until you guys address that discrepancy, you're both going to keep running into these types of situations where one party is annoyed at the other while the other party simply has no clue about what's really going on.", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable that you'd be feeling off about Valentine's Day, given the situation. And \"inconvenience to the restaurant staff\" is by no means an adequate excuse to set that aside - they'll be fine with the \"inconvenience,\" assuming they don't fill the table with someone who waited until the last minute to plan anything.", "NTA.\n\nCheating isn't just sex, what he did was absolutely cheating. He broke your trust. If reconciliation is even possible it is **vital** that he shows you that he is willing do whatever it takes to regain your trust and make-up for what he's done.\n\nMoping and telling you to suck it up isn't that. Reconsider reconciling.", "NTA - if you\u2019re not out to it, you\u2019re not up to it.  Don\u2019t feel guilty. He\u2019s the one who kissed a co-worker.", "NTA but he is for trying to coerce you into going when he is responsible for you not wanting to go", "NTA he cheated and you are still dealing with this. He has no right to push you to do anything you don\u2019t want to. Honestly he needs to get over the reservations, that is small shit. \n\nI hope you two are seeking marriage counseling and that he chooses to be better in the future.", "Mmmhh I just want to point out that kissing IS physical.  Also, he could have been having an Emotional Affair that later led to the kissing. \nMake sure that\u2019s all there is to it though. His story is pretty suspicious. \nAnd in regards to the reservation you\u2019re absolutely NTA. You have every right to feel betrayed and not wanting to celebrate your marriage right after an infidelity.", "You feel how you feel and no romantic gesture can make you hurry up and get over those feelings.

You weren\u2019t wrong for canceling dinner.\n\nYour a-h husband doesn\u2019t get to dictate your feelings or how you react to his infidelities.

One does not accidentally kiss. Similarly, flirting is intentional. Both are a complete betrayal of your trust.\n\nThen he has the gall to guilt you, when he is the violator.\n\nIf you want to continue your marriage, I highly recommend seeking therapy, individually or as a couple or both.", "Nta tell him to take his new gf", "Tell him if he wants to be a part of your life in any way, shape, or form (besides alimony payments), he needs to be understanding of your feelings right now and really take a look at himself.\n\nThat kiss would have and could have led to more.

That\u2019s going to be a no.", "NTA\n\nYou do whatever you need to do to work through his betrayal.  You owe him nothing.", "NTA. \u201cYeah last year sucked and you cheating kinda ruined this year, so thanks for that.\u201d", "NTA. He's so inappropriate to want to go celebrate your \"love\" when he's been cheating. Consider this tantrum proof that he doesn't actually care about you or reforming himself and please get out of there. You have NOTHING to feel guilt for.", "NTA: it was important, he chose to be unfaithful. Remorse required he understands the ramifications of his actions", "NTA- maybe if it was sooooo important he could've kept his lips (and probably his cock) to himself.", "NTA. He cheated. It takes time to get over that, even if you have decided to do so. And you get to get over this at your own pace, not his. Don't let him guilt you for still being upset at his cheating, and still working on getting over what he did.\n\nIf you want, you could suggest you just delay it - don't give a specific time, but tell him that when you feel up to it, you can reschedule. Make it a celebration of you when you BOTH feel safe in the relationship.", "NTA. He cheated and is now trying to rug sweep it by buying you things and spending money on you. You don\u2019t owe him anything. He should be lucky you haven\u2019t asked for a divorce already.", "NTA.\n\nHusband: Look, I know I flirted with and kissed another woman, but I really need you to suck it up and put a smile on your face for the sake of this reservation.  \n\nNope!  You are understandably hurt and are not in the mood.  Unsolicited advice: Couple counseling may be beneficial for you two.", "NTA:  OP states it didn\u2019t get physical flirting & a kiss. Ummmmm a kiss is physical. Your not going to forgive because who really does when their cheated on. If it happened once it will happen twice. (IMO) He sounds like a real prick!", "You\u2019re fine. He\u2019s delusional.   \nNTA.  Feel free to remind him loudly and often that HE ruined this Valentine\u2019s Day. \n\nBest wishes working through this.", "First of all, you don't know 100% with surety that it was only flirting/kiss.  For all you know they've been having sex regularly.  I would not want to have Valentines with him and the whole guilt trip thing, he's a major AH.   I think you need to step away and maybe take a break to see if you want to continue this relationship.  I would never trust him.  \n\nNTA", "NTA - He cheated on you", "NTA - He needs to quit his job and go full no contact.  He had an emotional affair and physical affair with the kiss and your response is understandable.

LOL at the offer of wine to put a smile on your face. I don't think he quite gets it.", "If they're kissing it's already physical.  If you stay with him and don't go to counseling, then you're continuing to delude yourself.", "NTA.

If this Valentine\u2019s Day was really important to him, he wouldn\u2019t have been flirting and kissing his coworker. You have every right to be upset. If you want to continue this marriage, I would suggest marriage counseling, because if he\u2019s truly remorseful he will need to see and discuss just how upset his actions have made you.", "NTA just call the restaurant and cancel the reservations. They will be grateful", "NTA. He wants an easy out for his emotional cheating- take you out on Valentine's and all is forgiven! Emotions don't work that way.", "NTA.  But honestly your husband is a cheater.  He will cheat again.\n\nHe should be going to individual therapy and showing you the most transparency.\n\nLet me guess - he\u2019s doing none of that.  You deserve better.", "As an ex-hospitality member of 16 years (server, bartender, hostess, cook, dishwasher), please let your husband know to not worry about inconveniencing restaurant workers. Valentine\u2019s Day is such a clusterfuck anyway that it\u2019s probably a relief that you canceled your reservation - one less table to serve on this shit show of an evening. Also, a big fat NTA. He\u2019s the AH for guilt tripping you after he cheated - incredibly repulsive behaviour", "NTA. He seems to be more concerned about inconveniencing restaurant workers than hurting you by having an affair. I\u2019m glad you stated your needs. Think about what you need going forward. What he needs to do to regain your trust and relationship and tell him that.", "NTA i would have told him to take the affair partner if he is so concerned about the reservation! He is the AH!", "Nta. What he was trying to do was 'Lovebomb' you and guilt you into forgiving him. Good on you for standing your ground.", "NTA but he did more than kissing. You need to get the full story from her. Him moping about you canceling Vday is actually weird.", "Nothing physical. They kissed. Someone needs a dictionary....", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When you are living with someone it's easy to be manipulated and gaslighted. The way you wrote it came across as if what he did was  a little thing that can be forgotten easily and that you believe you are overreacting. Your husband had an affair. Emotionally and physically. He betrayed your trust, connected with another woman. Trust once lost can never truly be 100 percent repaired. You deserve respect and understanding. The fact that he was behaving like this about a reservation tells me that you are not really a consideration for him.

I don't know how he manipulated you into thinking kissing and an emotional work affair is no big deal, but he sure did.\n\nNow he suddenly cares about valentine's and the servers and other people, he's oh so thoughtful except to... You know... His wife. You should've shut that shit down immediately. I can't believe his audacity, but I guess now he knows he can push you and you will just take it.", "NTA for cancelling but YTA for not leaving because you deserve better.", "Yet another thing that isn't an AH post IMO. This whole thing is driven by your feelings and your relationship status. \n\nIs it AH to not show up to your reservations at a restaurant on Valentine's day when you are perfectly able, yeppers.

It could be seen as a gesture of apology by some, or a chance to talk, connect and try to take steps back onto the right track.  You don't see or feel it that way, so you don't want to go which doesn't make you an AH but trying to put the date together wasn't an AH move either.", "YTA - While overall he's the AH, in this specific case you are the AH because you waited until the last minute.
