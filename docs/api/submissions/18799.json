When I was a freshman in high school, I met a white girl named \"Hailey\" [mid 20s] who quickly became one of my best friends. From the start it was clear, that my brother and \"Hailey\" were attracted to each other. A bit after high school, Hailey, and my brother became official.

I told my brother he should tell our parents about Hailey. My parents already knew Hailey as my best friend, and my mom, especially, really liked her. I told my brother that our parents were more liberal compared to people in their generation from a similar cultural background, and he had less reason to hide his relationship compared to some other Indians.

I probably would\u2019ve avoided that shit, too.", "Soft YTA. You're right that they probably didn't go about this the right way, but you didn't need to insult Hailey when she asked for an explanation. Instead you could say\n\n\"You know I'm 100% supportive of your relationship. My parents are too - they are very happy that you found each other. But they are hurt that the two of you lied to them for 6 years and didn't trust them despite having given you no indication that they would be anything but supportive.\"", "Dude NTA. I\u2019m in their exact same situation and even I know you need to tell parents *before* you drop the \u201cI\u2019m getting married\u201d ball. Not sure what they expected here.", "NTA, they were idiots.", "INFO: Is idiots a common phrase used between all of you? My friends and I frequently refer to each other and ourselves as 'idiots' so I'm pretty desensitized to the word.", "NTA you gave them sound advice before and they chose not to listen. Instead they chose to get engaged without ever telling your parents they were an item to begin with. He\u2019s using their situation as a crutch to listen the insult they inflicted on your parents for waiting so long. \n\nThe dating aspect their excuse is understandable waiting until marriage definitely not understandable.", "NAH.  I understand the frustration at watching your loved ones dig themselves a hole, but on the otherhand the only reason they were scared was because they love you and value your opinion.  No one is trying to hurt anyone, but it might have been more productive not to insult them.", "YTA \n\n\nI absolutely agree with you about this. It shows a lack of trust in your parents and a lack of closeness that I'm sure was heartbreaking for your parents because of how supportive they've tried to be. They were upset, not angry.\n\n\nThis happened to one of my parents' friends. Their son and his \"roommate\". He was always at family dinners, welcome as a best friend, etc. And then suddenly \"We're getting married\". His parents were happy for him and incredibly supportive, but hurt that they weren't included in such an important part of his  life.\n\n\nI know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, that parents aren't entitled to know, (especially when it comes to a same sex relationship, like in my example), but I can understand it being really hard for parents to basically be told \"I didn't trust you to love and support me\". \n\n\nBut the situation already happened. What was the point of calling them idiots after the fact? I understand the trying to convince them earlier that your parents would be supportive,  but now? That's just kicking a dog when it's down. You just want to rub an \"I told you so in their face\".", "INFO:  Why do you think you get to make decisions about other people's personal lives?  They don't have to tell anyone until they want to.", "Nta. Sounds like they never told the parents before because they liked having a \"secret \" relationship, and now it blew up on them for lying about it.", "YTA.\n\nThis is like saying someone who's gay is an idiot for not coming out to their parents soon enough, because obviously they'll accept them.\n\nBut even if you, and the person themself, is 99% sure that the parents would support them, that doesn't stop that 1% chance from niggling away in their brain. \n\nAnd, ultimately, it's their decision in the end when to come out.\n\nI view this situation as being no different.", "NTA. They were idiots especially considering your parents being accepting and the length of time they dated. cry me a river about dating a white girl dude as if every single movie with an Asian male lead doesn't have him marrying a white girl.", "ESH. Hiding the relationship for so long was not particularly kind or smart of them. However, you could have chosen to explain to Hailey why they were upset without being insulting. \n\nInstead of being gracious and generous in this difficult time, you chose to be hurtful. What did you gain by acting in this way?", "YTA. Name calling wasn't going to do anything but make a stressful situation more stressful. In your culture its hard to figure out who will actually be liberal and who will not.", "YTA - Their relationship is none of your business. You gave them advice they did not follow. So what? Does saying (basically) \"I told you so\" help them in any way? Don't be a dick about it.", "YTa", "YTA for name-calling, that was uncalled for and immature. \n\nYour parents do have the right to be upset that it took 6 years for them to come out. For 6 years, your brother was willing to hide his relationship. That must've been hard for Hailey. She wasn't an idiot, but going along with your brother's plan that was based on fear all this time must've been very difficult for her. You owe them a genuine apology.", "There is no such thing as \"the pressures an interracial couple faces\". It depends on your individual circumstances.\n\nI'm going to suspect that this was a lot worse for your parents because they know and like Hailey. It's not like your brother has a secret girlfriend that he's been keeping hidden for years: this is someone your parents know and like, and who has been in your home on a regular basis throughout this time period. \n\nThis isn't just a lie of omission. Your brother didn't \"just not mention that he had a gf\" - he and Hailey were effectively lying to your parents continuously for years.\n\nBut I don't see how your response was even vaguely helpful, so YTA.", "YTA for name calling. That was uncalled for and not helpful.  Yes, your brother should have been more open with your parents much earlier, but he must have felt they would be disapproving and did not want to deal with that. And, of course your parents are hurt that their son did not come to them earlier about his relationship with Hailey.\n\nSo, all that is what it is.  It's not the end of the world.  Apologize for the name calling and move forward.  You are brothers and you like Hailey as do your parents.  Make peace and have a happy family.  Go forward in love, not discord.", "YTA. Yes, it would be preferable if they were honest from the start, but they had reason to doubt they would be accepted by your parents. You said yourself that your parents are \"more liberal compared to other Indians\", which implies:\n\na) Indian families are generally not very accepting;\n\nb) Your parents are only relatively accepting. How accepting they can be still remained to be seen.\n\nSo yeah, your brother had reasonable doubt about your parents reaction.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
