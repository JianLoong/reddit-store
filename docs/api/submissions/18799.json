My friends and I frequently refer to each other and ourselves as 'idiots' so I'm pretty desensitized to the word.", "NTA you gave them sound advice before and they chose not to listen. Instead they chose to get engaged without ever telling your parents they were an item to begin with. He\u2019s using their situation as a crutch to lessen the insult they inflicted on your parents for waiting so long. \n\nThe dating aspect their excuse is understandable waiting until marriage definitely not understandable.", "NAH.  I understand the frustration at watching your loved ones dig themselves a hole, but on the otherhand the only reason they were scared was because they love you and value your opinion.  No one is trying to hurt anyone, but it might have been more productive not to insult them.", "YTA \n\n\nI absolutely agree with you about this. It shows a lack of trust in your parents and a lack of closeness that I'm sure was heartbreaking for your parents because of how supportive they've tried to be. They were upset, not angry.\n\n\nThis happened to one of my parents' friends. Their son and his \"roommate\". He was always at family dinners, welcome as a best friend, etc. And then suddenly \"We're getting married\". His parents were happy for him and incredibly supportive, but hurt that they weren't included in such an important part of his  life.\n\n\nI know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, that parents aren't entitled to know, (especially when it comes to a same sex relationship, like in my example), but I can understand it being really hard for parents to basically be told \"I didn't trust you to love and support me\". \n\n\nBut the situation already happened. What was the point of calling them idiots after the fact? I understand the trying to convince them earlier that your parents would be supportive,  but now? That's just kicking a dog when it's down. You just want to rub an \"I told you so in their face\".", "INFO:  Why do you think you get to make decisions about other people's personal lives?

Hiding the relationship for so long was not particularly kind or smart of them.

Does saying (basically) \"I told you so\" help them in any way? Don't be a dick about it.", "YTa", "YTA for name-calling, that was uncalled for and immature. \n\nYour parents do have the right to be upset that it took 6 years for them to come out. For 6 years, your brother was willing to hide his relationship. That must've been hard for Hailey. She wasn't an idiot, but going along with your brother's plan that was based on fear all this time must've been very difficult for her. You owe them a genuine apology.", "There is no such thing as \"the pressures an interracial couple faces\". It depends on your individual circumstances.\n\nI'm going to suspect that this was a lot worse for your parents because they know and like Hailey. It's not like your brother has a secret girlfriend that he's been keeping hidden for years: this is someone your parents know and like, and who has been in your home on a regular basis throughout this time period. \n\nThis isn't just a lie of omission. Your brother didn't \"just not mention that he had a gf\" - he and Hailey were effectively lying to your parents continuously for years.\n\nBut I don't see how your response was even vaguely helpful, so YTA.", "YTA for name calling. That was uncalled for and not helpful.  Yes, your brother should have been more open with your parents much earlier, but he must have felt they would be disapproving and did not want to deal with that. And, of course your parents are hurt that their son did not come to them earlier about his relationship with Hailey.\n\nSo, all that is what it is.  It's not the end of the world.  Apologize for the name calling and move forward.  You are brothers and you like Hailey as do your parents.  Make peace and have a happy family.  Go forward in love, not discord.", "YTA. Yes, it would be preferable if they were honest from the start, but they had reason to doubt they would be accepted by your parents. You said yourself that your parents are \"more liberal compared to other Indians\", which implies:\n\na) Indian families are generally not very accepting;\n\nb) Your parents are only relatively accepting. How accepting they can be still remained to be seen.\n\nSo yeah, your brother had reasonable doubt about your parents reaction.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From the outside I think my parents seemed fairly liberal in some ways, but I was privy to conversations that made me feel like I should not take the chance.

I wouldn\u2019t call them an asshole just because they didn\u2019t tell their parents about their relationship when their sibling wanted them to, versus when they themselves felt comfortable with it.\n\nOP, I agree with your brother that you don\u2019t seem to understand the pressures that come with interracial relationships. For that reason I think YTA, but if all you did was call them an idiot, that\u2019s a pretty minor thing to do tbh.", "Siblings like to call each other idiots?", "I also feel like \u201cWe\u2019re just hurt you kept it a secret so long\u201d Can be 100% genuine but it can also be \u201cThis is a more socially acceptable thing to be mad about so I\u2019m going to say this is why I\u2019m mad.\u201d You see it with people coming out as gay or trans all the time, some parents have to find an angle that allows them to be hurt and mad because they know they\u2019re not supposed to be but they are.\n\nI don\u2019t know these parents so it could be the real story! But also for these parents if your kids are scared to tell you the truth it says something and when you get mad they didn\u2019t tell you earlier it shows them they were right not to tell you", "Yes, agreed. Additionally, the OP should\u2019ve taken into account that there is a lot of stress involved with disappointing parents who you love and respect. That alone can cause years of procrastination issues. However, as someone else said it\u2019s a \u201csoft\u201d YTA. The OP ultimately gave them good advice. Now the couple needs to apologize and make it up to the parents. Maybe the BF/fianc\u00e9e takes the OP\u2019s Mom to a spa day, and the brother/fianc\u00e9 takes his dad golfing or whatever. OP should take the new fianc\u00e9s to dinner or drinks or something to apologize. Then all a happy family. \ud83d\ude01", "Crazy Rich Asians", "*Thank* you. I'm thinking the same thing. \nI can absolutely understand it being upsetting that your child hasn't felt that they can confide something like this in you, but sometimes societal expectations gnaw at us even when we know someone has been accepting. \n\nMy best friend is trans and my parents accept her fully. I still haven't told them that I am as well, because I think \"well, they support her, but what if it's different because I'm their child?\" Or \"What if they're supporting her around us to be nice but secretly don't?\" \nI know there *are* plenty of cases where parents will support something in theory but for some reason it's different with their kids, and that alone is scary enough to make you want to keep things that are often seen as controversial or outright unacceptable by others around you a secret from them. \n\nThey were scared and I completely understand it. It's not like this was a malicious lie.", "It's completely understandable though. My daughter came out to me as bi when she was around 19-20. Also told me she was polyamorous. She was a little taken aback and confused that I was more concerned with the polyamory than the bisexuality. I've sinced changed my mind on polyamory as well though. Anyway, their fears are understandable, and so is the hurt that the parents felt. I'm going with NAH because I believe OP meant well and maybe just stated it a little harsher than intended.", "Awe the shit you can get away with with a smile", "There\u2019s a difference between a playful idiot and \u201cyou all have fucked up an important relationship in your lives, idiot.\u201d\n\nThe second one isn\u2019t going to go over well.", "Sometimes parents are angry they didn't know sooner so they could put a monkey wrench in the relationship at an earlier stage.", "That's a very good point", "True but name one film made in the west where a guy whose family is from India didn't end up with a white girl.", "\u201cBless your heart.\u201d", "I was shocked at how butthurt some of my California friends got when I as like, \u201cshut up for a second assholes.\u201d  I live in New York.", "If you were ever a gamer, being called an idiot is just a greeting.", "Philly here. \"shut up for a second assholes\" sounds pretty polite to me.", "Boston here. It\u2019s only rude if you call them fucking assholes.", "you were unnecessarily put into spot . next time just stay away from being in the middle . nta ofcourse", "NTA. \n\nWaiting 2 years to tell parents is a while already, so giving them a little prod to say maybe you should tell them is good. They then waited another 4 years and would've continued waiting if it wasn't for them taking the next step of marriage. \n\n6 years ago was 2017. Think about how long it's been since COVID was first a thing and then roughly double that time. The parents are right to be upset, you tried to tell them and they didn't listen. That's idiotic. What's not idiotic is making sure you weren't there lol", "NTA: they were idiots. Who cares if they don't like it.\nYour brother is being sensitive and will get over it.", "NTA they shouldn't have hid the relationship. You could've worded it better idiot is harsh but overall not your fault and you warned them", "NTA. I could see waiting until it was serious, but waiting until your engage would feel like a betrayal to the parents.  Especially since they know the woman.  OPs brother has some fence mending to do with his parents.  I am sure they will forgive him soon but it hurts now", "You\u2019re a little bit unkind because you feel guilty too. You know you could have been more encouraging of them telling your parents a long time ago.  Don\u2019t make a big deal of this by trying to be right. \n\nThey know they did the wrong thing and you know they were in a difficult situation otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have been so invisible in this whole situation. It\u2019s not simple or easy for anyone including you. \n\nJust be open that you\u2019re sorry you snapped and wish you\u2019d been more supportive much earlier.  You wanted to protect your relationship with them too and didn\u2019t want to pressure them. The main thing is that no one is disowned and you can learn from this and be stronger as friends and family. Surviving these tests makes bonds stronger. Big hug.", "YTA, I'm afraid. What may appear easy to you -- from the outside looking in at a relationship -- can be very different from the way those involved in the relationship feel. It's not just a familial issue, interracial  couples of all kinds still get a second look or a raised, questioning eyebrow. How your brother and his fiancee handle their relationship is up to them. No one was actually hurt by not being let in on their romantic connection. Hindsight can be a double-edged sword. It's futile for the parents to hark back to what didn't happen six years ago; it cannot be undone. What's important is how the interracial union is regarded now and in the future.\n\nName calling says more about you than it does your brother and his fiancee. It's beneath you. You may want to pour oil on the waters with a sincere apology, but that's up to you.", "YTA", "Yta. You dident tell them why they were mad?", "YTA.\n\nThey went about this in a dumb manner. You were proven right in the end.\n\nBut you didn't have to be an AH about saying \"I told you so\".", "Soft YTA. This isn't quite the same, but my partner and I spent the first 6 years of our relationship (been together eleven years, for context) in the closet. We hid it from both our parents, but mostly hers, because they were very religious. \n\nThey become less prejudiced during that six year period, but we had every reason to believethey would strongly disapprove during the early years. It wouldn't have been safe, mentally or emotionally, to tell them at the beginning. They wised up towards the end, and though we did eventually tell them, they were cross with us for lying. \n\nHowever, the concerns we had were real, and their being upset with us was not one of our primary worries. Our worried were not being permitted to see each other anymore, my partner being pressured to return to church, or being pulled from the competitive school we attended. \n\nIf anyone had told me we were stupid or idiots for waiting until it was safe for us to come clean, I'd be really upset with them too. \n\nTry to understand where they are coming from, and do your best to make amends. You can say that you hadn't considered the concerns that they'd be grappling with as an  interracial couple, but you see now, and you'll support them through this time as your parents adjust. \n\nI wish them both a happy future together. \u2764\ufe0f", "sure, its an asshole thing to say but i don't think it's a *massively* shitty thing. honestly, its on your parents for not making them feel safe to say--ni matter how progressive you may persyieve them to be.", "NTA- Your poor parents, doesn't sound like they've done much to deserve the assumption they'd have a bad reaction! But regardless, they were always going to have to tell them one day, and if they had got a bad reaction they'd have lost the high ground somewhat by lying. If Bill Clinton taught us nothing else...", "Soft YTA\n\nA lot of people have an \"it's okay until it's my kid\" mentality. I've seen parents accept interracial marriage, gay couples, etc., from other people, but if it's *their* kids? Nope, must be a mistake. \n\nI think the real question here is why they felt the need to hide. It's on the parents to show their children they'll accept them no matter what. Especially if you come from a cultural background that typically doesn't accept such relationships. If your parents did not actively talk to you both about acceptance, that's on them.", "YTA. While you might think there was no reason for them to keep their relationship under the radar, that is their decision. Ideally it could have come out before an engagement announcement, but imagine having the fear (whether likely or not) that your parents wouldnt take your relationship as well as you thought. If he is going to stay with her, end of the day it could come down to having to chose her or his parents. That is a rough spot to be in. If they are getting married, presumably that choice is already made should it come up. At least a bit understandable to not want to risk it when you don't even know if the relationship is going to progress. \n\nAnd I take issue with accusing him/them of lying. Unless your parents actually asked and they denied it. Not telling your parents something about your personal life isn't lying.", "This level of coddling makes me legitimately nauseous lol.", "Yes soft YTA for how you reacted", "Exactly!  Words mean everything and how you say them.", "Oh that's a really good point.", "This comment is important and also YTA.\n\nEveryone\u2019s heart is in the right place and all of this is more wholesome than it seems except for OP\u2019s comment to her brother and friend. What was the purpose of it? What was the desired  reaction from them supposed to be to that?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right?\u201d\n\nCome on now. That\u2019s an odd way to be supportive and paying it forward to them, especially your friend who you wrote that she made the effort to make sure you weren\u2019t overlooked.\n\nJust inform them and it\u2019s for them to work it out with the parents. Be supportive. This is about them not you.", "definitely", "Yes", "Because they asked her??", "A Mandalorian reference?", "Yeah, they're lucky they don't live in the UK. Here it's pretty standard to be verbally abusive to the people you are close to. It's a sign of affection between friends (unless it's said in an aggressive, mouth spitting, red-in-the-face way - then its meant seriously).\n\nI'd be more soncerned with cold politeness. That's a sign your friend is pissed at you. \n\n\"You idiot\" isn't really an insult among relatives/friends here. More an affectionate observation."]}
