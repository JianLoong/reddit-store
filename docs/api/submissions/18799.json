But as my dad later told me, they weren't upset because Hailey is white. They're upset that they hid their relationship from them for so long. \n\nWell I met my brother and Hailey today.

I probably would\u2019ve avoided that shit, too.", "Soft YTA. You're right that they probably didn't go about this the right way, but you didn't need to insult Hailey when she asked for an explanation. Instead you could say\n\n\"You know I'm 100% supportive of your relationship. My parents are too - they are very happy that you found each other. But they are hurt that the two of you lied to them for 6 years and didn't trust them despite having given you no indication that they would be anything but supportive.\"", "Dude NTA. I\u2019m in their exact same situation and even I know you need to tell parents *before* you drop the \u201cI\u2019m getting married\u201d ball. Not sure what they expected here.", "NTA, they were idiots.", "INFO: Is idiots a common phrase used between all of you? My friends and I frequently refer to each other and ourselves as 'idiots' so I'm pretty desensitized to the word.", "NTA you gave them sound advice before and they chose not to listen. Instead they chose to get engaged without ever telling your parents they were an item to begin with. He\u2019s using their situation as a crutch to listen the insult they inflicted on your parents for waiting so long. \n\nThe dating aspect their excuse is understandable waiting until marriage definitely not understandable.", "NAH.  I understand the frustration at watching your loved ones dig themselves a hole, but on the otherhand the only reason they were scared was because they love you and value your opinion.  No one is trying to hurt anyone, but it might have been more productive not to insult them.", "YTA \n\n\nI absolutely agree with you about this. It shows a lack of trust in your parents and a lack of closeness that I'm sure was heartbreaking for your parents because of how supportive they've tried to be. They were upset, not angry.\n\n\nThis happened to one of my parents' friends. Their son and his \"roommate\". He was always at family dinners, welcome as a best friend, etc. And then suddenly \"We're getting married\". His parents were happy for him and incredibly supportive, but hurt that they weren't included in such an important part of his  life.\n\n\nI know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, that parents aren't entitled to know, (especially when it comes to a same sex relationship, like in my example), but I can understand it being really hard for parents to basically be told \"I didn't trust you to love and support me\". \n\n\nBut the situation already happened. What was the point of calling them idiots after the fact? I understand the trying to convince them earlier that your parents would be supportive,  but now? That's just kicking a dog when it's down. You just want to rub an \"I told you so in their face\".", "INFO:  Why do you think you get to make decisions about other people's personal lives?  They don't have to tell anyone until they want to.", "Nta. Sounds like they never told the parents before because they liked having a \"secret \" relationship, and now it blew up on them for lying about it.", "YTA.\n\nThis is like saying someone who's gay is an idiot for not coming out to their parents soon enough, because obviously they'll accept them.\n\nBut even if you, and the person themself, is 99% sure that the parents would support them, that doesn't stop that 1% chance from niggling away in their brain. \n\nAnd, ultimately, it's their decision in the end when to come out.\n\nI view this situation as being no different.", "NTA. They were idiots especially considering your parents being accepting and the length of time they dated. cry me a river about dating a white girl dude as if every single movie with an Asian male lead doesn't have him marrying a white girl.", "ESH. Hiding the relationship for so long was not particularly kind or smart of them. However, you could have chosen to explain to Hailey why they were upset without being insulting. \n\nInstead of being gracious and generous in this difficult time, you chose to be hurtful. What did you gain by acting in this way?", "YTA. Name calling wasn't going to do anything but make a stressful situation more stressful. In your culture its hard to figure out who will actually be liberal and who will not.", "YTA - Their relationship is none of your business. You gave them advice they did not follow. So what? Does saying (basically) \"I told you so\" help them in any way? Don't be a dick about it.", "YTa", "YTA for name-calling, that was uncalled for and immature. \n\nYour parents do have the right to be upset that it took 6 years for them to come out. For 6 years, your brother was willing to hide his relationship. That must've been hard for Hailey. She wasn't an idiot, but going along with your brother's plan that was based on fear all this time must've been very difficult for her. You owe them a genuine apology.", "There is no such thing as \"the pressures an interracial couple faces\". It depends on your individual circumstances.\n\nI'm going to suspect that this was a lot worse for your parents because they know and like Hailey. It's not like your brother has a secret girlfriend that he's been keeping hidden for years: this is someone your parents know and like, and who has been in your home on a regular basis throughout this time period. \n\nThis isn't just a lie of omission. Your brother didn't \"just not mention that he had a gf\" - he and Hailey were effectively lying to your parents continuously for years.\n\nBut I don't see how your response was even vaguely helpful, so YTA.", "YTA for name calling. That was uncalled for and not helpful.  Yes, your brother should have been more open with your parents much earlier, but he must have felt they would be disapproving and did not want to deal with that. And, of course your parents are hurt that their son did not come to them earlier about his relationship with Hailey.\n\nSo, all that is what it is.  It's not the end of the world.  Apologize for the name calling and move forward.  You are brothers and you like Hailey as do your parents.  Make peace and have a happy family.  Go forward in love, not discord.", "YTA. Yes, it would be preferable if they were honest from the start, but they had reason to doubt they would be accepted by your parents. You said yourself that your parents are \"more liberal compared to other Indians\", which implies:\n\na) Indian families are generally not very accepting;\n\nb) Your parents are only relatively accepting. How accepting they can be still remained to be seen.\n\nSo yeah, your brother had reasonable doubt about your parents reaction.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They had six years. They could have slowly revealed this to your parents. They didn't, parents got hurt. My advice, stay out of it. You said you're piece. My guess is they probably feel foolish for not being more up front earlier.", "NTA, your poor parents! I'm also South Asian and my parents aren't conservative either. It would break their hearts to know their children felt the need to hide their relationship for years.  \n\nHow long have Hailey's parents known? It will break their heart again to find out that they are the last to know and that your bro and Hailey think so low of them to hide for 6 years over some imagined discrimination by your parents. It's going to take a long time for your parents to heal from the hurt they caused. Idiots.", "NTA, I'm in an interracial relationship, and I told my parents when we started dating so I wouldn't surprise them if we do get engaged.

They are just taking out their anger on you because your parents aren't the happiest to find out this late.", "YTA - of course the parents were going to be hurt, but they also need to understand there is a lot of pressure in their community.  Calling them idiots was uncalled for and just mean for no reason.  You could have explained your parents' perspective without being cruel.", "I mean, you're right but YTA, it wasn't necessary, I'm sure they already knew at that point that they were being ridiculous.", "NTA, this is such a nothing sandwich. You basically said it was stupid to hide a relationship when your parents wouldn't have cared, and you were right. I don't know why they keep trying to involve you in telling the parents, it's their relationship, they need to stand in their own two feet on these things.", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, Six years is way too long of a period to keep being afraid. And \u201cIdiot\u201d is not a slur or anything to be this much offended over, especially to the person who\u2019s been warning & encouraging them again and again to come clean. \n\nBecause of their Idiotness, I\u2019m not saying N AH, But I think your brother has some issues with your parents. Maybe you\u2019ve noticed more of a liberal side of them while your brother experienced things differently. Of maybe they\u2019ve other interracial couples go through hell for this and hence they were scared. I\u2019m just saying there must be a reason why they thought it wasn\u2019t safe to come out till now.

It sounds like your parents are much more understanding than hers (they\u2019d more than likely kick her out) so I wonder what gave your brother the concern or impression that this would be an issue? Regardless - I think it\u2019s not something any of us can understand unless we go through it ourselves. You\u2019re also old enough to be able to communicate better without calling them idiots. \nYTA", "ESH except for the parents. All 3 of you did a lot of lying, hiding, and omitting to your parents over 6 years. It's hard to believe that no one thought to even bring up a hypothetical situation where one of  you was dating outside your culture/race with your parents to see their reactions. They took in a gay cousin for f**ks sake! That's sounds like some amazing parents. It makes me wonder about the brother and fiance relationship. A  big part of which was built on hiding and lying.", "YTA you\u2019re insulting them when they were scared they wouldn\u2019t be accepted. Instead of your parents being mad at them, maybe they should look at themselves and wonder how they raised their child to not trust in them. I\u2019m sure there is a lot of subconscious stuff that they did that your brother picked up on. \n\nLike when parents tell their kids they love them no matter what,  whether they are straight or gay but then talk negatively of two men kissing in public. It\u2019s fine they are gay but I don\u2019t want to see it type stuff. Kids instantly pick up on that and realize that their parents in fact would not be happy if they were gay.", "YTA. Why would you editorialize like that, at this stage of the game? Even if (or though) you're right, what does it add to anything now?

It's a different world now adays and there are different things we are all scared of. Touching base from time to time could help with the trust.", "Really depends how he called then idiots though.

Why?", "How did you come to that conclusion?", "No, it's more like calling someone an idiot for coming out by telling their parents they are getting married to someone of the same sex. That is idiotic, absolutely so.", "Yeah that's fair. I'm in a group chat that intersects two social circles and those of us who use \"idiots\" only direct it at each other because that's what we're used to and someone from one of the overlapping circles once flat out said\n\n>Wow. You guys are really mean to each other.\n\nSo I can see both sides of the argument in this thread.
