His kids were being too loud and neither he nor his wife did something about it. I may be TA because I asked him to play with the kids or ask them to be more quiet while they were over.

They were very rude houseguests and refusing to tell their kids no or to teach them how to behave properly is going to backfire big time.", "NTA. Please do not apologize, that will only train your family to have temper tantrums when you do something they dislike. \n\nThis happened in your home. You and your partner were both very patient and kind, but it's your house and your rules. It seems like your brother wants to take offense to your home having different rules from his, so maybe let him know it's not a judgement thing. Your life is different from his and so your home has different standards of behaviour. If they want to be welcome, they'll have to adapt.", "NTA...brother and family should no longer be welcome to stay overnight at your home. Let them stay in a hotel or with  your parents.", "Man, your brother and SIL are the only assholes here. Children need to understand that they can\u2019t just be loud and disruptive whenever they feel like it; the 2m old, sure, but the 4y? That kid is absolutely old enough to understand that their (very gracious!) hosts need to work and sleep. Your parents aren\u2019t very cool either for not sticking up for you and your partner.", "NTA. Your Brother and SIL are incredibly entitled. It's perfectly reasonable to request that children behave themselves.", "NTA, I refer you to the infamous parental own \"my house my rules\".\n\nBut on a serious note, obviously kids have lower self control than adults but it seems that they aren't being raised right. Parents should raise their kids to be as polite and unintrusive as possible when they're guests at somebody else's home.\n\nBeyond that, you didn't even say anything to the kids, you politely put up with it until you were able to speak to your brother about it. That's not how things should go. Kids shouldn't be raised thinking that when they're guests, they can do whatever they want and trample all over the hosts. They should be taught boundaries. Obviously these boundaries won't be respected completely because that's the nature of kids and they forget things and get carried away, but at least they'll be putting in some effort to be good guests and the noise will be reduced a bit.", "NTA. And next time - if there is one - don\u2019t wait and don\u2019t ask that they \u2018try\u2019 to do anything.

As a parent with children i would be mortified if someone felt they had to ask me that. \n\nif you are staying with someone you do everything to make sure you are not a burden.\n\nkids can still play without causing large amounts of noise. we use the term inside voices they can shout as loud as they want but not inside.", "NTA\n\nIf you allow a child to \"express themselves\" whithout putting in place healthy boundaries then you make a mistake.\n\nThe first time I said \"no\" to my baby my husband was surprised \"the baby is too small, he can\u2019t speak, he won't understand\". \n\nI laughed and now he laughs also thinking about it. \n\nThey need to have boundaries. \n\nIt's more of an A move to do this in other people's house.\n\nThey are the A ones, along with your parents and you definetly do not need to apologise.\n\nI would have let them do this in a hotel right then.\n\nIs your brother the \"golden child\"?\n\nI'm not surprised that your brother thinks they did nothing wrong because your brother thinks you should not have any boundaries when it comes to him and his \"wants\". \n\nI would limit the contact with your family (and no more hosting them all, including parents) but i supose you will still want to have them in your life...\n\nI wonder what other expectations (will) they have of you...", "NTA but this is on you - you work from home - you need to treat your home like the office and give people clear boundaries. You cant be having young kids over during working hours unless the parents agree to take them out. Which leaves the weekend and if your GF needs to sleep for her work then too, then the rule is its quiet or they leave.\n\nThe rule is that its the guests who behave in other peoples home and if they are too young to do that, then the parents need to take them out and bring them back in the evenings.\n\nAlso your brother and SIL sound insufferble - those kids not being parented will grow up to be so entitled. \n\nDo not apologise. Your home was a work environment and their host is a a doctor who needs to sleep. They chose the wrong setting - they are the parents - if they cant control the kids they need to find a different environment so they can be as they please.", "NTA. Why should anyone have to wear earplugs in their own house? Your brother and SIL sound like bad houseguests, and there was no need at all for them to get your mother involved", "Hard NTA, and I don\u2019t think you owe them an apology. If my kid had EVER acted this way at a friend\u2019s house, I would have quietly grabbed her/our things and left. No over explaining things to the kids, just loving action that fully communicates that this type of behavior is unacceptable. Of course they\u2019re kids and will push any and all boundaries, which is what kids do. What the parents are SUPPOSED to do is firmly but lovingly set those boundaries, incl following through on consequences as a result of said behavior. \n\nYour brother and SIL are not doing a good job at that, best to leave it be and hope for the best.", "NTA. It is not normal to wear earbuds in your home. \n\n>I was originally against the idea because for some reason when we spend time together it always ends up badly but he was extremely persistent so I asked my girlfriend and we agreed.\n\nHe wants everything on his terms. When he didn't get exactly what he wanted, he told on you to mummy and daddy. Don't let them stay again.", "NTA They showed no respect to you both. Kids misbehave but the parents/guardians are responsible for keeping the kids quiet. They should apologize.", "NTA", "NTA. Your brother needs too learn common courtesy and teach it to his kids. They are guests in your home and expecting you to wear earbuds. They want to let them act like that in their own home that\u2019s fine (I guess) but to stay with someone else they should have proper manners.", "NTA.  Regular people don\u2019t have to wear earbuds to be able to drown out children\u2019s sounds.  They are inconsiderate guests and teaching their children to be the same.", "NTA\n\nI have kids in that age. You can and should tell them \"no\" or to be quieter! How else are they supposed to learn to function in society? And \"you should wear earplugs like normal people\" like WTF?! If it's normal for them to need earplugs around their kids, their problem. But this is totally NOT normal! My kids can be really loud as well, but inside this is something i see they do as short as possible. And you are not allowed to tell the kids if it's too much?! Again, WTF?!", "NTA\nIt\u2019s basic common decency. Don\u2019t invite them to stay over at your house again", "You're NTA. They were being horrible guests and hopefully you're going to refer them to the nearest hotels next time they're in town.", "NTA. You\u2019re too nice. I would have put them out the moment they made the earplugs comment.", "Why did a damn near 39 yr old man get a teenager pregnant? NTA", "NTA. The only one you should apologize to is your girlfriend because you should have told your brother to quiet his kids or leave the house so she could sleep", "NTA\n\n>My SIL thinks she shouldn't tell them to not do something because they're just kids and they should be allowed to express themselves and that kind of stuff.\n\nYour SIL is setting both her and your brother up for a *world* of pain with this attitude. They might think their kids' behaviour is funny and cute right now while they're very young, but it's going to backfire spectacularly on them when the kids go to school. 'They're just expressing themselves' won't wash when they're called in by the headteacher to explain why their kids are running amok in the classroom, disrespecting the teacher and disrupting others' learning.\n\n>He said his kids were behaving completely normally and that maybe we should try and wear earbuds like normal people.\n\nThey might be behaving normally according to the (lack of) rules in their house, but while they're staying with you they need to understand that you and your girlfriend need a certain level of quiet while you work/rest. Since they're unable to meet that requirement, I would make it clear that they're not welcome back to stay with you again until they can. Also, ignore your parents.", "NTA and this.  Asking for them to not be obnoxiously loud while you're trying to work or your SO is trying to sleep after a long shift is entirely reasonable, and it sounds like they feel entitled to take over your home and make zero effort to be good houseguests and not to be disruptive.  Absolutely do not apologize, they were being rude and self entitled, and your parents are indulging it.  Never again in your home, and I might skip the holidays with the parents this year and until they apologize as well because if they're going to insist you be treated as a doormat, they can do that stuff with the kid they favor."]}
