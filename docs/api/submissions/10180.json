It could take years and years. By the time it's done, his kids will be grown and out of the house. You can't send them pictures, because you want to wait until the entire thing is complete.", "YTA. What did you expect from a toddler and a baby? They're gonna make noise, you should of stood your ground and refuse to let them stay.", "YTA\n\n> He said his kids were behaving completely normally and that maybe we should try and wear earbuds like normal people.\n\nThe audacity to tell someone who is hosting you, after you harrassed them about it until they gave in, to wear ear buds in their own damn home because your children are being loud.\n\n> He said we were being terrible hosts and expecting kids to act like a grown up.\n\nNo, you are just expecting them to be parents - not just impartial caretakers of feral children. \n\nHell your brother could have taken the kids to a local park, and there was absolutely no reason to be playing loud music.", "OP does not need to apologize and should NEVER host them again.\n\nNTA", "If someone needs to sleep because of work, you take the kids out or get them something  quiet to do. That is how many people do it bc one partner works shifts!", "This exactly.\n\nOp was also very respectful by putting up with it for a while and kindly discussing it with the parents (rather than the kids directly) when they had a chance to, as the parents seem to want.\n\nIt's part of the parents responsibility to teach their kids how to not be rude little self centered shits. 'Someone is sleeping, we need to be quiet' is pretty standard stuff to teach kids. Ya, you may have to remind them, they're kids, or get out activities that are more quiet etc, but the lesson and example and idea are the important parts. \n\nThese parents are doing a huge disservice their kids who will be shocked when they start school or daycare and have to learn thay actually they can't just do whatever thehw any. Their teacher isn't gonna be a doormat and they're gonna struggle with that since they've been given free reign. Other kids won't want to have out with them if they don't understand basic social interaction.\n\nAlso, just a detail but normal people don't have to wear earplugs around kids.", "For real! Major side eye", "Me also immediately trying to math it...OP how long have they been together...?", "I think OP means 2 year old boy. Of course there will be some noises from toddlers. But you can entertain them with something rather quiet. Or take them to a playground. But even a baby you can put in a stroller...", "I\u2019m also at a loss. \n\nIt also sounds like OP is supposed to apologize for requesting some quiet. I mean my niece and nephew when told to sit quietly will do so. They are 6 & 4 now but even the 1year old will sit on my lap quietly if told to.", "And even if there was a situation where they couldn't keep the kids quiet (i.e. one of them was having a meltdown or something), they could take the kids outside or for a drive until they calm down.\n\nI wonder if they would have the same reaction if their kids were being loud at the wedding? Would they just let their kids run around screaming at the wedding because kids need to be able to express themselves or would they take the kids out of the situation and get them to calm down? They're capable of controlling their kids, they just don't see OP's work or her girlfriend's sleep as important enough to try.", "I started reading and then got to the part of \"they like to let their kids express themselves\" and immediately thought, Oh,, they are THOSE kind of parents.  That would be the last time they were guests in my home.  What is wrong with teaching children about respect for others??", "We were expected to be that way all the time inside. And screaming wasn\u2019t allowed unless we were dying or being kidnapped. Being a little loud outside only was ok but still only a little loud, not disrupting the neighbors loud. I feel my parents were exactly right in that regards!", "Exactly,  when did it become bad or cruel to ask someone to quiet down and to be considerate of others.", "Come on now, everyone knows that *true* personal expression requires screaming. /s", "Yes!  Remember the phrase \"use your inside voices!\" ?", "All I can say is heaven help the next generation", "My girls generation used that phrase. Ours was \u201cquiet down or you\u2019re going to bed\u201d. Or \u201c if you\u2019re that bored that you can\u2019t be quiet, I will find you something to do!\u201d"]}
