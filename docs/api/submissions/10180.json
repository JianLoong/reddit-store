Please do not apologize, that will only train your family to have temper tantrums when you do something they dislike. \n\nThis happened in your home. You and your partner were both very patient and kind, but it's your house and your rules. It seems like your brother wants to take offense to your home having different rules from his, so maybe let him know it's not a judgement thing.

Children need to understand that they can\u2019t just be loud and disruptive whenever they feel like it; the 2m old, sure, but the 4y?

Your parents aren\u2019t very cool either for not sticking up for you and your partner.", "NTA. Your Brother and SIL are incredibly entitled. It's perfectly reasonable to request that children behave themselves.", "NTA, I refer you to the infamous parental own \"my house my rules\".\n\nBut on a serious note, obviously kids have lower self control than adults but it seems that they aren't being raised right. Parents should raise their kids to be as polite and unintrusive as possible when they're guests at somebody else's home.\n\nBeyond that, you didn't even say anything to the kids, you politely put up with it until you were able to speak to your brother about it. That's not how things should go. Kids shouldn't be raised thinking that when they're guests, they can do whatever they want and trample all over the hosts. They should be taught boundaries. Obviously these boundaries won't be respected completely because that's the nature of kids and they forget things and get carried away, but at least they'll be putting in some effort to be good guests and the noise will be reduced a bit.", "NTA.

You cant be having young kids over during working hours unless the parents agree to take them out. Which leaves the weekend and if your GF needs to sleep for her work then too, then the rule is its quiet or they leave.\n\nThe rule is that its the guests who behave in other peoples home and if they are too young to do that, then the parents need to take them out and bring them back in the evenings.\n\nAlso your brother and SIL sound insufferble - those kids not being parented will grow up to be so entitled. \n\nDo not apologise. Your home was a work environment and their host is a a doctor who needs to sleep.

If my kid had EVER acted this way at a friend\u2019s house, I would have quietly grabbed her/our things and left. No over explaining things to the kids, just loving action that fully communicates that this type of behavior is unacceptable. Of course they\u2019re kids and will push any and all boundaries, which is what kids do. What the parents are SUPPOSED to do is firmly but lovingly set those boundaries, incl following through on consequences as a result of said behavior. \n\nYour brother and SIL are not doing a good job at that, best to leave it be and hope for the best.", "NTA.

Kids misbehave but the parents/guardians are responsible for keeping the kids quiet. They should apologize.", "NTA", "NTA. Your brother needs too learn common courtesy and teach it to his kids. They are guests in your home and expecting you to wear earbuds. They want to let them act like that in their own home that\u2019s fine (I guess) but to stay with someone else they should have proper manners.", "NTA.  Regular people don\u2019t have to wear earbuds to be able to drown out children\u2019s sounds.  They are inconsiderate guests and teaching their children to be the same.", "NTA\n\nI have kids in that age. You can and should tell them \"no\" or to be quieter! How else are they supposed to learn to function in society? And \"you should wear earplugs like normal people\" like WTF?! If it's normal for them to need earplugs around their kids, their problem.

They might think their kids' behaviour is funny and cute right now while they're very young, but it's going to backfire spectacularly on them when the kids go to school. 'They're just expressing themselves' won't wash when they're called in by the headteacher to explain why their kids are running amok in the classroom, disrespecting the teacher and disrupting others' learning.\n\n>He said his kids were behaving completely normally and that maybe we should try and wear earbuds like normal people.\n\nThey might be behaving normally according to the (lack of) rules in their house, but while they're staying with you they need to understand that you and your girlfriend need a certain level of quiet while you work/rest. Since they're unable to meet that requirement, I would make it clear that they're not welcome back to stay with you again until they can. Also, ignore your parents.", "NTA and this.  Asking for them to not be obnoxiously loud while you're trying to work or your SO is trying to sleep after a long shift is entirely reasonable, and it sounds like they feel entitled to take over your home and make zero effort to be good houseguests and not to be disruptive.  Absolutely do not apologize, they were being rude and self entitled, and your parents are indulging it.  Never again in your home, and I might skip the holidays with the parents this year and until they apologize as well because if they're going to insist you be treated as a doormat, they can do that stuff with the kid they favor.", "Can we just mention that based on the ages provided, your adult brother got an 18 year old pregnant?", "Ok, so they are never staying at yours again. Seems like a happy solution for everyone.", "It's virtually an AITA rule that the ones who demand an apology are the ones in the wrong--domineering MILs, cheating siblings, your brother, etc.\n\nIt's also a rule that when you let relatives stay with you, there will be trouble.

Sometimes being in a different environment will overstimulate kids. If your brother and family ask to stay again discuss ground rules before they come instead of after. Maybe look up some places they can take the kids ( park, activity center, etc) for a few hours while your gf is resting.", "NTA When you are a guest in someone's home you attempt to be the best you can be out of appreciation.

But I already knew you weren\u2019t when I realized he knocked up a teenager when he was in his late 20\u2019s.", "NTA.  Teaching children to be polite & empathetic is a basic function of raising good people & citizens.  Letting them do whatever they want is unfair to them.
