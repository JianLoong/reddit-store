You want your kids to be kids ok do activities with them. Give them choices so there are boundaries but they still have a say. But if you let your kids go wild and see there are no consequences and that adults are wrong not to let them have their way your in for trouble. One of many examples I had a child in my class before she got to pre-k had been kicked out of four different daycare centers (which we were not aware of at the time). By that time the parents couldn\u2019t deal with their own daughter and didn\u2019t want them around. They were there as the school opened and didn\u2019t come back until closing. The girl would get mad if she didn\u2019t get what activity she wanted or honestly if we didn\u2019t do everything she wanted.

Okay, keep 'em to yourself, then. But not in my house!' is the correct response for parents like this. I mean, I get if you don't want others physically disciplining your kid, but to correct behavior when I see it? And then for your grown ass brother to act as if his kids 'normal' behavior is normal for your household is okay and playing 'run and tell that' with your parents when you gently ask him to get them to tone it down? Nah, that's okay. We don't need to spend much time around one another.\n\nOP, I think you're going to need to realize that there is a marked difference in the way your bro and SIL do things and minimize your contact with them if you want to keep the peace in your family.

Oh . .  we are being disrespectful and rude in some's home . .  someone who is hosting us because we need somewhere to stay ?", "WTF. \n\n| My SIL thinks she shouldn't tell them to not do something because they're just kids and they should be allowed to express themselves and that kind of stuff. |\n\nYour brother and his wife are too lazy to parent their kids. Do not allow them to come over again. NTA. Edit: this is what happens when kids have kids.", "NTA - your house your rules. The parents should have been considerate and taken them to a park to get out some energy.\n\nThat being said, a lot of y\u2019all have some very gross attitudes about how children should act.  If you think children should always listen to adults and can\u2019t say no, that they should be seen and not heard, you are setting them up to be abused.", "NTA.  Hey, how you parent your kids is none of my business.  How they act in my house is my business.  Next time you can get a hotel room... bro.", "NTA", ">I am here to ask for objective judgement. \n\nI see you're new to social media. :-)\n\nMy objective judgment: NTA, because you made a reasonable request, from your point of view, not realizing that a four-year-old and a two-year-old can be pretty unpredictable.\n\nToday you're more informed, and you'll be better able to resist your brother's request to stay with you in the future, unless you're open to potential chaos.\n\nI'd treat this as a worthwhile learning experience.  Should you apologize?  Sure, to keep the peace, but not because you did anything wrong.", "Shocker your bro who got a teenager pregnant when he was in his late twenties has terrible boundaries \n\nNTA", "NTA. And never let them stay again. Also how old was your brother when he got a 19/18 year old pregnant!?!? Eww.", "You are definitely NTA but was anyone else alarmed by the age difference of his brother and SIL? Especially for them having a 4 year old? She would have been 18/19 when she got knocked up and he was 28", "I came here to say what wedding takes DAYS? And who insists on family hosting them that long despite objections?", "Gross, that brother is a creep", "That brother must\u2019ve been so desperate for romance that he goes for teenage girls", "Check out Wyoming trying to make it legal for an adult male of any age to marry a child of 9 yrs old. ...it Christian patriarchy sickening bs. Litterally in the Bible\"if you rape a virgin then marry her it isn't rape\" only virgins during that time were typically girls under 12 Mary was 13 for example.", "This is absolutely horrible. All of it. This is exactly how children get abused for years.", "I figured a lot of people wouldn\u2019t understand it. They are happy, well adjusted children. I was raised this way and am a very successful adult. Teaching your child self control really young does nothing but benefit that child. It is hard on Momma because no mother likes a crying child, but her one year old can sit through an hour funeral service with out making a sound. I can take her 6 & 4 year olds anywhere with me and they don\u2019t act out. They aren\u2019t abused but they have been taught to be quiet and still when asked. Believe me, they are loud and obnoxious too. They\u2019re kids.", "Yeah, children who are physically restrained will eventually learn that fighting is useless, especially when their own mother has demonstrated she won\u2019t help them when they are in distress."]}
