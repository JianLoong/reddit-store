Be glad if you don\u2019t have a septic tank. As his way, it would fill up with water and poo in the yard and poo coming up out of the toilet. Rains hard too and even take less time before there is a mess. Only takes one person using lots of water to cause such a problem. NTA. As it really is uncalled for. Whether cold or hot water turned on for eons. Dishwashers, washing machine they use hot water plus somebody else might want a hot shower. Water isn\u2019t as abundant as he thinks as far as in the world.

If he doesn't get in the shower it can shut off. \n\nAnd if DH needs steam, there are better ways to do that than sitting and shitting. And, oh, hemorhoids from sitting. \n\nNTA, for wanting to save some water, and your husband's third world country comment alone makes him TA. There are plenty of places in the US with insufficient potable water. His ignorance is palpable.", "NTA. Is he afraid someone will hear his pooping noises? Lol! It's definitely wasteful and honestly kinda weird that he turns the water on 1st just to shit.", "NTA. I think you should get down to the real reason he does this though cause I\u2019m sure there is one. \n\nStory time: Back when my city (Melbourne, Aus) was in a severe drought with stringent water restrictions One of my old neighbours use to run hot water literally all day everyday because  she\u2019d just moved from a very humid country on the equator and she hated our weather and missed hers. I asked her to buy a steamer instead & then even offered to buy one for her cause not only did she screw up our water but im an environmentalist and I couldn\u2019t stand hearing all that wastage. But no, a steamer doesn\u2019t make it hot enough or make the right sort of steam. Only a steady stream of water to make the *right* kind of humidity apparently, no if, and\u2019s or buts. \n\nI hated calling the council cause I usually despise people who complain about their neighbours for just existing but I couldn\u2019t deal with it. Long story short: the council tried and the water company tried and no one could get her to stop, after a lot of failed attempts at curtailing her usage with fines & threats the court eventually put her on water restrictions that cut her water off for all but 1 hour a day. And god damn If she didn\u2019t make the most of that hour!", "NTA. His type of mentality exacerbates shortages. He's being selfish.", "NTA\n\nYeah, this is a shared commodity.

A vein in my head suddenly pulsated what with imagining all the water that's been and will be wasted by people like your husband.", "OMG my husband does this too. I started going in and turning off the water. We live in a freaking desert. I might be the AH, but so is he.", "NTA. He is. Especially annoying given how valuable (and finite) a resource water is.", "NTA, all you can do is give him your opinion. He as an adult has the right to do as he wishes.

Yes, that is using money that could otherwise be spent on other things.  Yes, it is almost certainly generating money on other things.  Yes it is simply wasteful.  \n\nBut you are initiating the same argument over and over.  Either find a way to mutually move forward, agree to disagree, or leave.", "NTA but it probably does help him by the steam calming him down. \n\nAlot of people dont know this but you shouldnt take longer to poop than you do to pee. \n\nBut we have 2 neural systems that effect this \n\n1. Sympathetic\n\n2. Parasympathetic\n\nThey work opposite to eachother\n\nWhen the sympathetic nervous system is activated-- think stress-- it activates things like heart rate and breath rate and decreases digestion\n\nWhen the parasympathetic is activated --think calm-- it decreases things like heart rate and breath rate and increases digestion. \n\nIf you've ever worked a long day and then didnt have to pee untill you were driving home, this is why. \n\nAside from diet changes- because sitting on the toilet for 45 minutes will certainly result in hemorrhoids- he should find another way to decompress prior to starting his shower. Even if it seems backwards, maybe shower first and then poop but get a bidet because who tf wants to poo AFTER the shower lol.", "NAH - unless he's using all the hot water, and you are left with none/not enough.  \n\nMy understanding here - is that there is 100% water reusage when it comes to something like a shower.  So all the water that is used, runs through the system, gets purified, and goes back into the ecosystem.  \n\nSo as long as there isn't a capacity issue, and he's willing to pay for it - I don't see the big deal.  Sure, there is some extra energy usage.  And I can see the argument for it being frivolous.  But there is plenty of things people do that wastes electricity / resources.
