Husband and I live in an older tract house that was unwisely plumbed.  It can take forever (so it seems) to get hot water to the end of the line, and meanwhile that precious liquid is running down the drain.  So, when the old pipes needed replacing, we put in a recirculating system that simply uses a pump, driven by timers in the rooms that need hot water, to start the stuff circulating out of the water heater.  We use 15 minute timers for bathrooms and an hour timer for the kitchen, in order to provide continuous hot water to the dishwasher.  I go into the bathroom, start the timer, do my toilet business, crank the timer up again if it took awhile (I don't distract myself while I'm there, but my gut is often cranky and needs seated encouragement) and hey, no water wasted at all.  When I start my shower the water is hot.\n\nAlso, shutting off the water while soaping up in the shower is a very eco-friendly choice.\n\nFinally, how does steam help your husband feel better?  That's something worth exploring.  If it's a sinus issue, there are devices that provide steam for breathing.  (My housemate, who has sinus issues, swears by hers.)  Is it about skin hydration?  It can feel better to be in steam, but hot water and steam can also prompt the body to give off water, and leave it under-hydrated when the wet heat is removed.  Lots of stuff to explore here.

Plenty of people do it.", "Treatment of grey and black water (run-off and sewage) is a costly, polluting process in itself, and it isn't 1:1 efficient \u2014 it doesn't reclaim all the water. Depending on the area you're charged for this by the water company more than you're charged for the water itself.\n\nAlso, treated water doesn't re-enter the water cycle in the same place it left; it re-enters further downstream, in wetter areas. And *also* it takes a long time to move back through the water cycle to a place where it's usable by humans.\n\nIf they just put the water through a magic sieve and pumped it back to your house, there would be no droughts.", "Lol is it my problem your feel insulted?

This is clearly something your husband really enjoys, he's paying for it and can afford it. I don't really see why it's such a big issue for you. Are you so environmentally conscious in everything you do? Do you take public transport everywhere or have a car? Or multiple cars? Do you buy local produce only or food that's been flown/shipped hundreds or thousand of miles? Sorry, I'm probably going overboard here. But my point is that his extra water in the morning might make a big difference to his wellbeing, and it's not having a detrimental affect on your lives together other than the arguments it's causing when you keep calling him out on it. If it's something he's unwilling to change then maybe compromise and find other areas where he can make a positive impact on the environment. It's not worth letting something this silly become a strain on your marriage.", "NTA. I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would turn on the shower several minutes *before* they actually plan on getting in. It's one thing to wait about a minute to make sure it's warm enough before you step in.

I think if he's an asshole for wasting water like that, then we're probably *all* assholes.\n\nBut I think he is an asshole just for the stubbornness of it all. I mean, letting it run for a few minutes just because it's nice to step into a steamy shower, OK, but 20 minutes is ridiculous, and 45 minutes almost sounds like he has OCD or something, some issue that means he is very rigid about sticking to patterns and habits.\n\nNTA.", "Oh dear, whose gonna tell her?", "YTA.

I am sure you do things that annoy him.    If the worst thing he does in your marriage is to take too long in the bathroom, you are pretty lucky.    I personally take extra long showers in the morning because it helps me wake up and get myself in the right mindset for the day.      I am NOT a morning person and my husband is.    I like to wake up slowly and he rolls out of bed bright eyed and bushy tailed.      Early in our marriage, he complained about my long showers and I did try cutting them shorter to make him happy.   The result was not good.    I discovered that I needed the quiet time in the shower to wake up to avoid feeling anxious or overwhelmed during the day.      I know it seems weird, but some people just need that extra time in the morning.
