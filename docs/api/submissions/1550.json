(Californian frustration mode off.)\n\nOP is NTA.  \n\nHowever, if you can afford it (and own your own home), there is an excellent tech solution.  Husband and I live in an older tract house that was unwisely plumbed.  It can take forever (so it seems) to get hot water to the end of the line, and meanwhile that precious liquid is running down the drain.  So, when the old pipes needed replacing, we put in a recirculating system that simply uses a pump, driven by timers in the rooms that need hot water, to start the stuff circulating out of the water heater.  We use 15 minute timers for bathrooms and an hour timer for the kitchen, in order to provide continuous hot water to the dishwasher.  I go into the bathroom, start the timer, do my toilet business, crank the timer up again if it took awhile (I don't distract myself while I'm there, but my gut is often cranky and needs seated encouragement) and hey, no water wasted at all.  When I start my shower the water is hot.\n\nAlso, shutting off the water while soaping up in the shower is a very eco-friendly choice.\n\nFinally, how does steam help your husband feel better?  That's something worth exploring.  If it's a sinus issue, there are devices that provide steam for breathing.  (My housemate, who has sinus issues, swears by hers.)  Is it about skin hydration?  It can feel better to be in steam, but hot water and steam can also prompt the body to give off water, and leave it under-hydrated when the wet heat is removed.  Lots of stuff to explore here.  I hope you two can resolve the issue without water wastage but also keeping everyone optimally comfortable.", "I run the shower too, only I want to say at most 5 minutes, mostly because I like HOT showers.

I am going to dart board this to show that the costs from this is minimal. \n\nA modern shower is 2.5 gpm. So  a ten minute shower is 25 gallons.  \n\nTo raise the water temperature from 50F to 110F is 60 degrees.  \n\nHeat rise is calcuated as so: \n\nBTH = GPM \\* 500 \\* dt   (That is BTUs per hour).\n\nBTH = 2.5 \\*500 \\* 60 =75000 BTU per hour. \n\nFor a ten minute shower that is 12,500 BTUs. \n\nA gas therm is roughly 100,000 BTUs. For the sake of discussion, a therm of gas costs about a dollar (YMMV depending on localization).  \n\nSo your ten minute shower costs about ten to fifteen cents.
