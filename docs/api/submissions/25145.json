No?  Nothing to worry about.", "NTA if you made a deep sea bar, then it would be a dick move. You just remade what he threw away.", "You didn\u2019t steal it.

Funny enough a popular diner near me went though something similar. Original owner was looking to sell. The diner was popular enough with daily regulars. Someone swooped in and bought it, changed a bunch of stuff and it all went down hill. 6-12 months later old owner buys it back at half of the price he was paid.
