She brushed it off for a long time thinking it was just some troll, and carried on with her life, happily married. \n\nThen, several months ago I got a phone call from my mother where she began the conversation with \u201chow long have you know  about Jeff\u2019s affair?!\u201d\n\nAfter I denied any knowledge she explained that Jeff had told Rose about his affair and that the woman was threatening to ruin his marriage. The woman claimed that she and I were really close friends, and I knew everything about their affair and could ruin my sister\u2019s life with the intel I had fed her.\n\nShe alleged that she knew me because I was blackmailing one of her friends (?) and she was one of the people warning me off, but somehow this has turned into a friendship where I tell her all my sisters secrets. \n\nAs my mother was clearly going to ring my sister straight after her call with me (it\u2019s her usual form), I explained I knew nothing about it, and if I had I would have told Rose in an instant. Then carried on with my day, but remained stressed about it. \n\nI was updated in drips and drabs by my mother for the next few days, and finally received a text off Rose saying that there was some stuff being said about me and that I needed to sort it out. Then she blocked my number and deleted me from everything. \n\nSo, at the end of my work day I rang her to straighten things out, and she began the conversation by saying that she was my big sister and no matter what I\u2019ve done she\u2019ll never judge me and will always be there for me. Which was sweet, but entirely misguided. So, I explained the same to her as I did to my mother.\n\nShe seemed to accept my explanation, and I told her that if she needed anything she could come to me but I would give her time to sort her marriage out if she\u2019d prefer. I haven\u2019t heard from her since.\n\nSince then, asides from a brief period of contact when my step dad was in hospital, and a couple of texts updating me on big family things (ie deaths etc), I haven\u2019t had any contact with my mother either. \n\nLast night, I got a phone call from Jeff while at a friend\u2019s birthday party. He asked if I was going to my mother\u2019s for Christmas, I said no, and he actually dared to ask me why. I explained that I was at a friends, so I didn\u2019t want to get into it right then, but there were a myriad of reasons that he was aware of. \nHe then said he\u2019d call me today, and hasn\u2019t. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t feel guilty for not going home for Christmas, I know my family will try to make me feel bad, so basically yeah, aita?", "created_utc": 1703373094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18phlr4/aita_my_f29_sisters_f43_husband_m50ish_blamed_me/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, I\u2019ve not heard from her since and I\u2019m still blocked on most social media; the only way I can check that she\u2019s still alive is via a Facebook group for the street she lives on which I\u2019m only included in because I used to live there. \n\nIt\u2019s just a bizarre situation, and I have no idea why him and his mistress have chosen me as the scapegoat.
