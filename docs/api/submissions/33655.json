The woman claimed that she and I were really close friends, and I knew everything about their affair and could ruin my sister\u2019s life with the intel I had fed her.\n\nShe alleged that she knew me because I was blackmailing one of her friends (?) and she was one of the people warning me off, but somehow this has turned into a friendship where I tell her all my sisters secrets. \n\nAs my mother was clearly going to ring my sister straight after her call with me (it\u2019s her usual form), I explained I knew nothing about it, and if I had I would have told Rose in an instant. Then carried on with my day, but remained stressed about it. \n\nI was updated in drips and drabs by my mother for the next few days, and finally received a text off Rose saying that there was some stuff being said about me and that I needed to sort it out. Then she blocked my number and deleted me from everything. \n\nSo, at the end of my work day I rang her to straighten things out, and she began the conversation by saying that she was my big sister and no matter what I\u2019ve done she\u2019ll never judge me and will always be there for me. Which was sweet, but entirely misguided. So, I explained the same to her as I did to my mother.\n\nShe seemed to accept my explanation, and I told her that if she needed anything she could come to me but I would give her time to sort her marriage out if she\u2019d prefer. I haven\u2019t heard from her since.\n\nSince then, asides from a brief period of contact when my step dad was in hospital, and a couple of texts updating me on big family things (ie deaths etc), I haven\u2019t had any contact with my mother either. \n\nLast night, I got a phone call from Jeff while at a friend\u2019s birthday party. He asked if I was going to my mother\u2019s for Christmas, I said no, and he actually dared to ask me why. I explained that I was at a friends, so I didn\u2019t want to get into it right then, but there were a myriad of reasons that he was aware of. \nHe then said he\u2019d call me today, and hasn\u2019t. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t feel guilty for not going home for Christmas, I know my family will try to make me feel bad, so basically yeah, aita?", "created_utc": 1703373094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18phlr4/aita_my_f29_sisters_f43_husband_m50ish_blamed_me/", "score": 440, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because that's the only way any of this would make sense.", "He\u2019d been seeing a therapist for a little while who (according to Rose) was actively encouraging him to taking his frustrations out on Rose. She validated his feelings of anger at stupid things like how my sister loads the dishwasher etc. \n\nThen these Instagram messages started, and Rose seemed to brush it off, but I\u2019ve later come to find out via my mother that after he came clean, she suspected it was me who had been sending the messages and had been analysing how I\u2019ve previously texted her etc to see if the language was similar. \n\nApparently the other nail in the coffin of my assumed guilt was that the small business I work for follows the therapists Instagram (which isn\u2019t unusual, our marketing team follow local businesses / potential customers all the time). \n\nBut when I explained to her that I knew nothing about it, she seemed to accept it. However, I\u2019ve not heard from her since and I\u2019m still blocked on most social media; the only way I can check that she\u2019s still alive is via a Facebook group for the street she lives on which I\u2019m only included in because I used to live there. \n\nIt\u2019s just a bizarre situation, and I have no idea why him and his mistress have chosen me as the scapegoat.

Report this.", "Realistically, the most obvious person to be sending the messages is the mistress. It has been two years of being the dirty secret and she has decided it is time for Rose to go so she can be the next Mrs Cheating-AH. Personally, I think she deserves him. It always nice when two awful people find each other and focus all that awfulness on each other. It is a shame Rose is collateral damage. What I don't understand is why your family would believe you would be gossiping about Rose's cheating husband behind her back instead of telling her when they have known you all your life and while the mistress has shown themselves to be manipulative, completely unethical, has a huge incentive to break up Jeff's marriage but doesn't want Jeff to blame her for the marriage breakdown.

They let every tiny issue blow up and expect you to just pretend it never happened until the next time they\u2019re pissed at you and drag it all back up. \n\nPrime example, my mother doesn\u2019t speak to her sister anymore because of a huge drama stemming from my aunt posting a photo of her son\u2019s wedding and cropping us out. Was it rude? Yes. Was it appropriately bad to result in months long tension, a huge row between Rose and our cousin, and eventually cutting all ties? Definitely not.", "Personally I believe it\u2019s either the mistress spinning this tale, or BIL is the one who\u2019s made it up to put a rift between me and Rose because he knows instinctively that my stance would be that she should leave him.", "Report that therapist. Pleaseee ruuin her career for ruining people's marriage", "Sounds like the therapist fell in love with your BIL, and was actively working towards ruining the marriage. Of course she knows you, she probably has inside information about all of you. Both you and your sister should be very careful, therapist sounds a bit psycho", "There's no way a therapist would encourage a patient to take their frustration out on a 3rd party. So ridiculous!", "This sounds completely insane, like... schizophrenic on Jeff's part. \n\nDo you know for certain that there is a therapist? Or rather that the therapist was having sex with Jeff? Or is this all just going by his own admission? It almost sounds like delusional fantasies especially with the grand conspiracy narrative, roping you in, roping in some random instagram person (who was supposedly your friend?) and of course his therapist. \n\nThen the question is, who was the instagram person? It wouldn't make sense for it to be Jeff or anyone playing a part on Jeff's behalf, unless he wanted to dissolve his marriage. Could it be the therapist playing a character? Maybe she wanted Jeff all to herself? Or who else would possibly know? \n\nHow bizarre. Definitely NTA, but I'm not sure why your family would be so quick to dismiss your word on this, why your mother would essentially go NC. Very weird and disgusting that anyone would drag you into this especially since you had zero involvement or knowledge about any of it, literally a completely innocent victim being used as a scapegoat.", "Rose has the makings of a lawsuit that will bankrupt that therapist.\n\nSo does her husband, but I'm less gleeful about that.", "I kinda agree to the comment.

Not your monkeys. Not your circus.\n\nKeep your distance.", "NTA. My bet is on BIL. His excuse for not stopping the affair.

Even if they can't act on it, they might have previous allegations against her from others that they havent been able to proceed with. The way she has effectively triangulated the situation sounds like she is very experienced at pulling these stunts and I worry about her having access to vulnerable people", "My mother told me after my sister told her that he admitted it. \n\nPersonally, I think she\u2019s struggling to process it so is willing to accept a villain that isn\u2019t him, it\u2019s just a shame that he chose me to push that narrative onto. \n\nI\u2019m definitely low contact, i just feel guilty because my stepdad hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, nor have my other sisters kids, so suddenly not having any relationship with them seems cruel"]}
