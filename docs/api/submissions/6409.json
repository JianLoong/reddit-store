We're both social and have managed to make a few members of our respective friend groups interact due to their mutual interests and together we're a pretty close knit group now. Anyway, we went club hopping on NYE and decided it would be really cute if we had a multi-cultural brunch the next day. \n\nAnd all of this was doordash because none of us can cook. The criteria was we bring one main dish/appetizer and one dessert/appetizer so none of us cheap out on our contribution and none of us have any allergies so that wasn't an issue either. \n\nThere were italian dishes, chinese, ethiopian, French, Vietnamese, American and 2 different regional indian dishes. Overall, it slapped. They were all comfort food, nothing fancy. \n\nIndia has indo-chinese food which I despise and it's ruined soy sauce for me. I retch and it triggers bad acidity. I actively avoid a majority of east asian cuisine, obviously. \n\nAnyway, we served ourselves an equal amount of all the dishes and ate. (A; Chinese) was sitting next to me and noticed I didn't reach for their dishes. It was kung pao chicken and chow mein. I ate every other dish and they saw that. Idk how they honed in on this because we were chattering away and I paid attention to nobody's plate but mine. \n\nThey proceeded to ask me if I'd like some and I declined they insisted and I declined again so they asked why. I said I don't eat a lot of East Asian food because it doesn't sit well with me. They then pointed out I had taken the korean food. Korean food was literally kimbap and hotteok which passed my caveat so I said that. \n\nSo, they called me racist. And not jokingly. I apologized and said that's not my intention it's literally a food intolerance and I'm allowed to have one. And even if that's not the case I'm allowed to eat what I want to eat.\n\n'A' dug their heels in and said it was disrespectful that I won't even try some and I am an asshole for trying to exclude them on new year's. I joked saying it's not their new year yet (because Chinese new year is a different day and my specific region in India also has a different new year) This pissed them off and they asked to swap places away from me. The brunch ended on an uncomfortable note and EOD A sent a message on the GC saying my intolerant behavior and refusal to accept their culture has made the group an unsafe place for them so they'll be leaving.\n\nMy bf and friends asked me to apologize just so. This conversation happened on the gc and I conceded and said I'll put it up on here and whatever the outcome we act accordingly.\n\nSo ya AITA for not eating the Chinese?\n\nEDIT:\n\n1. Firstly, people are assuming this kimbap was just rice and seaweed. It was actually pickled vegetables rice and seaweed. No hint of soy sauce whatsoever other than as a dip. When I said I've had just rice and seaweed it was very much past tense when my Korean friend made it for me that way. None of these dishes were handmade by any of us.\n2. And people seem to have misunderstood when I said \"not all that korean\" I understood original comment to mean I had a lot of Korean dishes. There were two and I had them because neither had soy sauce. It does not mean it's not fully Korean or it's a Korean rip off.\n3. No I don't think Indo Chinese and Chinese is the same. I think soy sauce is the same. I also didn't say I don't eat East Asian food I said I don't eat most East Asian food.\n\nI've maintained this throughout.

But I can tell you that people shit their pants over the fact that I don\u2019t eat lobster and I live in New England, I\u2019m 50 years old and I think they finally stopped freaking out about it. I was born in New England it\u2019s not like I moved here for the food. People are weird I\u2019m sorry this happened to you and no you should not apologize for not liking certain foods ever\n\nYour significant other is trying to violate boundaries you have about food that you want to eat and that\u2019s weird.

I will say you didn\u2019t handle this with the most tact. Instead of saying East Asian food doesn\u2019t sit well with you, it would have been more accurate and more tactful to just say that you\u2019re intolerant to soy sauce, and it looked good but you can\u2019t eat anything with soy sauce. Also making a joke about Chinese new year to someone calling you racist is just stupid. I don\u2019t think it was racist but god damn was that bad timing.", "NTA. What you eat is your business. Anyone commenting on it is just rude.", "NTA.  You don't have to explain to ANYONE why you aren't eating the Chinese food. You DID explain and that wasn't sufficient enough?  Too bad.", "Isn\u2019t their a difference between regular Chinese food and Indo-Chinese food?", "NTA - something is up with A. For one it\u2019s weird to be that observant on what others were eating. There\u2019s got to be more of why this triggered A. \n\nIt sounds like you just quietly avoided the food which is fine. Everyone has food preferences and intolerance and your not required to eat all the food.", "NTA - your body; your choice of what to put in it.  If you have an intolerance of soy, there's no reason to subject yourself to it.  A can pound sand.", "NTA. I am sure they would have liked it even less if you'd eaten a bite then started retching at the table. But it sounds like you would have been better actually explaining you can't eat certain ingredients including soy sauce, so you do not eat food which contains, or is likely to contain it. \n\nNow they are calling your intolerant behaviour, maybe it is worth clarifying it is your gastro-intestinal system which intolerant.", "NTA.\n\nYOU know your palate and food choices. You're not required to like all cuisine.", "NTA. While Chinese food and Indo-Chinese food are different, the thing they have in common is the part that you have some sort of intolerance or allergy to, which is the soy sauce. You tried all of the dishes that you assumed did not contain soy, and refrained from eating the ones that you assumed might contain it, which makes sense.\n\nWhen you were called on it, I get the desire not to go into great details on your medical needs or food preferences, but with hindsight it would probably have just been easier to say \u201cUnfortunately I can\u2019t eat soy and forgot to give you all a heads-up in advance, so I\u2019m just eating the dishes that are not likely to contain it\u201d. At that point any pressuring from A about not eating her dishes makes her look like a jerk. As it is now, you said you don\u2019t like food from East Asia while eating other food from that region, which makes no sense taking your words at face value.\n\nI also understand the New Year mention as being a joke since your New Year is also not on Jan 1 - I\u2019m going to guess A is not aware of that and assumed you were making a crack at her and got offended, rather than asking for clarification and discovering you were trying to joke about a shared commonality. Maybe next time try \u201cit\u2019s not **either of our culture\u2019s** New Years yet\u201d, rather than \u201cit\u2019s not **your** New Years yet\u201d.\n\nSometimes trying to be quick with communication means that important info is left out or not conveyed properly. If you want to try to salvage this friendship it would probably be worth taking the high road and sending a message to the group chat saying that you apologize for offending A, it was not your intent, but she took some of the things you said out of context. 1) You can\u2019t eat soy and forgot to warn everyone before they ordered food, so you avoided the dishes that might contain it based on standard ingredients, and you felt awkward and didn\u2019t want to go into detail about your medical problems when A confronted you about not eating her food. This left her with the wrong impression, which you\u2019re sorry for. And B) your new year is also not Jan 1, so you were trying to share a joke with A about having different calendars from the \u2018western standard\u2019, rather than make a joke at her expense - again, you\u2019re sorry it flopped. Maybe the group can do a bit of a \u2018cultural exchange\u2019 and celebrate Chinese New Year and your New Year at the appropriate times?", "NTA. \n\nYou perhaps should have just said \"soy sauce gives me bad acid reflux\", and skipped the somewhat tone-deaf Chinese New Year joke, but you're not racist for having a food intolerance. \n\nI understand why A would be on edge after 2-3 years of intense anti-asian racism during the pandemic, but that doesn't give them the right to take it out on you. Going off on you like that was totally uncalled for.\n\nI think, if you want to try and salvage things, maybe reaching out to explain & apologize (for making A feel excluded, not for your food choices) would go a long way. But if not, I think it'd be 100% fair to just wash your hands of it and let them go.", "NTA. You're allowed to have dietary restrictions and preferences. That has nothing to do with accepting or rejecting someone's culture. I have gluten free friends, I wouldn't be offended if they didn't eat pasta I made for a potluck. It's not some rejection of my Italian-American culture. They're not obliged to power through to avoid insulting me. If anything, I'd be upset with myself for making something that everyone couldn't enjoy.\n\nApologize if you want, but I'd personally tell them to fuck right off. They don't have a right to make you eat food that causes health issues. And the fact that they basically demeaned you as a bigot in a public airing of grievance is just childish and infantile. I'd personally welcome to opportunity to rid myself of such shitty people.", "NTA\n\nYou don't like the food, you don't eat it. It's not offensive.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault you don\u2019t like certain foods or if they make you feel sick. You even told them that it doesn\u2019t sit well on your stomach. Yeah, you could have forced yourself to eat some buy then you would have been sick. \n\nI would talk your friend again and apologize.

If I were them, I would simply say:\" Ok, more for me.\" and keep eating.", "NTA You are allowed to know what you don't like and know when something doesn't sit well with you. In no way were you excluding anyone by not choosing that food to eat.", "NTA, if you don't like soy sauce you don't like soy sauce, this is an extremely weird thing for you friend to a) notice, b) make a scene about, c) take personally, and d) leave a friend group over. I would apologize for making him feel uncomfortable (the new year's line was funny but not the move in the moment) but I would say you deserve to have your food preferences and intolerances respected and should receive an apology in return. You ate Korean food sans soy sauce. \n\nHonestly who fucking cares though? Maybe you just didn't *feel like* eating Chinese that day, it still wouldn't be racist even if all you ate was Italian.", "op=NTA\n\nWhy would someone turn this into a race issue--it's a food issue.\n\nhow does it make this so-called friend unsafe, that you left more food for others to eat.\n\nThey repeatedly harassed YOU--if anyone should feel \"unsafe\" it would be you.\n\nDo NOT apologize.

You don\u2019t owe her an answer but to save the vibes, especially after the distasteful joke you threw.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not racist to dislike a particular style of cuisine.

Why make a comment about East Asian food while you have Korean food on your plate? \n\nIt seems like you could have avoided the problem in two ways:  1) you could have at least tried the food.  You're not going to have acid reflux from one bite.  Or put a little on your plate and move it around.  OR 2) Explain very specifically that you've tried Kung Pao Chicken from (that restaurant) and you didn't care for it. Or say it's not as good as REAL Chinese food.", "NTA, who stalks what you eat, or don\u2019t eat?  Then calls you out and makes it a racist act?  Then when you say you don\u2019t really like those dishes, decides you are intolerant?  I generally don\u2019t like  most Mexican food, but I don\u2019t think that makes me a racist.

Once she declined twice that should have been the end of the story.   \n\n\nOP: NTA", "She could have answered \"I only eat non-Korean East Asian food when Mars and Jupiter are in alignment and I'm wearing blue in the southern hemisphere\" and nobody would have a right to object.", "Similar, but not the same.", "I'm sorry, I forgot that if someone keeps pushing you to do something you don't want to do, it's your fault for not being a mind reader and not saying the right thing that would definitely make them stop. Everyone has the right to push food on others unless someone gives what they think is a justified reason.", "No, she said she doesn\u2019t enjoy indo-Chinese food because of soy sauce and has the same aversion to Chinese food. Regardless, she has the right to not like certain foods and they were pressured upon her. I know several Asian people who don\u2019t enjoy Indian food. I know several Europeans who don\u2019t enjoy Indian food. Am I supposed to force them to eat it and call them racist if they don\u2019t?\n\nShes allowed to have preferences of food. She\u2019s allowed to have a preference as to what she puts into her body. She can like Japanese and korean and dislike Chinese and Laotian. She can hate burgers and like pizza. None of this is racist.", "Except she stated, pretty clearly that she has an aversion to soy sauce and that it is prevalent in both types of cooking.", "Okay but this isn\u2019t how it works in the Korean food OP was eating.", "Hi OP\u2019s friend A! Hope you\u2019re having a good time desperately trying to convince everyone OP\u2019s racist because they don\u2019t like soy sauce", "That\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t the AH until she started saying all those excuses and bringing culture into it. - I did say she wasn\u2019t the AH until she did that. \n\nI couldn\u2019t care less until she said the NY thing. The ignorance in what was in kimbap with soy sauce\u2026 whatever, her intolerance is all in her head - but the NYE comment. \n\nYeah that\u2019s why she\u2019s TAH and ESH - the other person probably pushed it cos she said weird stuff like \u201cI don\u2019t eat East Asian food\u201d", "The question is whether her stomach can tell the difference.  Again, what does avoiding throwing up have to do with an opinion of a people?  She clearly was okay sitting at the table with them.  She clearly had no prejudice against the people.  And she has probably seen those dished before as they are offered at almost any Chinese place.  And she made the choice to pass on them.  She gets acid build up, and pukes... its the food not the cooks.  Region or neighborhood who cares... she just didn't want to be physically sick... ffs.", "No need for you to do that if you could comprehend what I wrote", "Same - no friend would continuously push to eat food and then on the other hand no friend would make that NYE comment.", "*rolls eyes* you keep changing your story.\n\nWhatever YTA and now I know FOR SURE there\u2019s more to the story with all the changing of your answers.", "Yes, because being pushed should means it\u2019s okay to say racist things rather than saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to. Stop\u201d. \ud83d\ude44 \nI\u2019ll remember that wise tidbit and pass it along to others that it\u2019s fine to make borderline racist comments when someone oversteps your boundaries.", "So if she has an aversion to soy sauce why is she eating a Korean dish that also has soy sauce", "She got sick from indo Chinese food. Not regular Chinese food. Indo Chinese is way more spicier and is more like a curry. That\u2019s not how traditional Chinese food is prepared. So OP is going based off an assumption.", "It\u2019s all in the details", "The Korean dishes she had didn't have any soy sauce in them at all... one had it as an optional dipper, but OP passed on that.", "Is the person who offered the Chinese food also Chinese? You mentioned \u201ctheir New Year\u201d so they may think you\u2019re being racist if you insulted them and their heritage.\n\nIf not, NTA", "NTA and I can\u2019t believe that is actually in debate, If what you posted here is accurate and is the whole story. Is there nothing more to this story? No backstory? This is so weird.", "NTA\n\nNot eating two dishes out of an entire potluck is not a slight on someone's culture. I do think you could have explained better that foods with a noticeable soy sauce flavor upset your stomach, but I don't think you're an AH for it.", "NTA, and it is very strange that A was specifically monitoring what you ate. I have an intolerance to tomatoes which is complex and hard to explain; I would be very off-balance if someone demanded to know why I wasn't eating the tomato-laced Tex Mex offerings.", "Whoa now, this is going too far. Commenting on what people eat is pretty rude, and calling people racist for not eating a dish that doesn't agree with them is really next level. NTA.", "NTA \n\nAll you did was not eat food triggers like an acid reflux or something. You never said anything racist or did anything of that sort to the person. Also it\u2019s wrong of them to try to make you eat food that you don\u2019t want in general. The situation sounds like the person was looking to get in an argument.", "NTA - I really liked Chinese food where I grow up and lived for most of my life. Now I\u2019m living in an South American country since 8 years and really don\u2019t like the Chinese food here for the same reason that it\u2019s mostly full of soy sauce. But I love other Asian food and do cook a lot of Asian food my self. If it would been at least home cooked food I might have tried but even if not, to call you a racist for that is just ridiculous.", "NTA- I hate all seafood! I have been given s**t about this my whole life. Including being told that I must have been switched at birth because it's supposedly not possible for a child of a mom from Holland and a dad from Maine to dislike seafood so much. You don't like soy sauce. Soy sauce causes gastric issues. So you don't eat anything with soy sauce. You are definitely NTA, A is the AH for finding something minor and blowing it out of proportion. Sounds like she was looking for something to be upset about so she could get you out of the friend group.", "NTA", "NTA, but you probably should have just said you don't like soy sauce and most Chinese food, particularly take out, is made with soy sauce in the sauce. Could have ended the discussion there. Btw I don't know if authentic Chinese food is made with soy sauce, just know most American take out soy sauce is heavily used.\n\nThe New years joke was poor taste after already being called racist tbh.", "Unsafe lol? Buttery soft.", "NTA. I love shrimp but my husband hates it with a passion. I won't force him to eat it. You're entitled to eat whatever you fancy. Maybe you could have worded your regular better, but it looks like your Chinese colleague is projecting their own beliefs on you. \"He refuses to eat Chinese because it's Chinese\" instead of \"he refuses to eat Chinese because he simply doesn't like it.\"", "Nta.  \u201cI apologize for having an intolerance to soy.  I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t eat it to satisfy you because he diarrhea and nausea that I get from it would probably ruin the mood.  Next time I promise to blow up your toilets so as not to be seen as a racist\u201d", "Wtf Nta go nc with that person. Legit when is it racist to not eat a certain food. Hell, even in my culture there are dishes that I won\u2019t touch", "Yeah totally agree, definitely NTA. To me it seems like A felt insecure and that's why they monitored what others ate. After noticing OP didn't try any of the food A brought, A felt like that might be racially motivated. And instead of asking \"OP, did you try my (doordashed) dishes yet? I think they taste amazing!\" they let their insecurities take the wheel and made accusations. And they even doubled down on this saying they don't feel safe in the group cause OP didn't eat their food and they are sure it's racially motivated.", "I have a friend that loves Asian food but can't eat anything with soy in it because they're allergic.\n\nThey've gotten flak for not wanting to go to restaurants that use soy sauce or tofu because cross contamination is a big risk. People have called them racist. I think it's crazy.", "Dude. I got called racist for not wanting to watch a foreign film unless it has english subtitles.(American who speaks no foreign languages beyond half remembered Japanese from 15 years ago) The person who called me racist said that I should look up the script, have Google translate it then read the script while I watched the movie. I called her ridiculous and she got super mad.", "I\u2019m Chinese and I would never even notice what anyone else was eating at a potluck, barring something like they\u2019re being rude af and have heaped all of 1 dish on their own plate.\n\nAnd on the off chance that I did notice someone avoiding Chinese food, at most I\u2019d think \u201cguess they\u2019re not a fan lol\u201d and move on with my day.", "Fuck it!

You really need to take a long hard look in the mirror. It's painfully obvious that you're TA who OP is talking about and now you are desperately trying to convince the internet that OP is a racist.\n\nIt's not racist for OP to dislike soy sauce and avoid dishes that they think may contain a lot of soy sauce.\n\nSeriously, quit being such a bully. OP is NTA but you sure are.", "No they didn\u2019t - they only brought up that it wasn\u2019t Chinese new year to A. Read it again, she only explains here that India also has a different NY.
