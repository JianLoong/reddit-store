TW cancer & parental death", "selftext": "I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for four years. We've planned to get engaged closer to our 30s when we have more financial flexibility to afford the big, nice wedding and honeymoon we've always talked about. However, my mom was recently diagnosed with cancer for the second time and the outlook is a couple of years at best. I'm a mess, I don't even feel alive myself anymore.  \nWhile consoling me last week, my boyfriend brought up the idea of getting engaged now and having a small ceremony with just family and our closest friends so that my mom can see me get married. Heartbreaking to hear, but yeah, absolutely. I don't need a big fancy wedding anymore, I just need my mom there.  \nI feel so selfish for thinking about this, but I don't want his parents there. His mother is a horrible, mean woman. His dad is objectively a great man, but he doesn't stand up to her. His siblings both got married recently, and she made the planning experience and day so difficult for them. Picked huge fights about anything that wasn't her way, started drama with other family, made herself the center of attention whenever she could at each of their weddings. On his brother's wedding day she even told guests that his wife looked fat in her wedding dress. I could write pages on all the narcissistic, emotionally abusive things she does -- no amount of talking to her changes anything, she's a textbook narcissistic. She's nice to my face in that sickeningly fake-sweet Catholic way, but his siblings and several cousins have told me many times about awful things she's said about me/my family and that she wishes he'd leave me.   \nI've always been annoyed that I'll have to deal with her BS when we eventually started planning our wedding, but so goes life. I could handle it, my parents are beyond fantastic. We'd just grey rock her craziness like we always have, it'd be fine.   \nThat's all out the window now. The only thing I need concerning this wedding is for it to be as happy and loving as possible. I cannot handle the idea of anyone making it about anything other than that. I wish I could be confident knowing that if I explain that to her she'll act like a decent person, but I'm not. I can already envision her giving some speech in front of everybody about how even though I'm losing my mom, I'm gaining a new one in her -- she already insinuated that the first time my mom got sick, it makes my blood absolutely boil.  \nI know it's selfish, but I'm so scared that if she's there she'll put a stain I can't remove on some of the last happy memories I get to make with my mom. WIBTA to ask my boyfriend/fiance (lol) to not invite his parents? Maybe a few years down the line we could do another ceremony with them. I know that'll be an awful conversation to have and she'll raise hell, but she'd raise hell either way.

Sure, you can go low-contact (or no-contact) later in life if need be. But this isn't just your day, it's your fiancee's day as well, and it sounds like you're not considering his wants or needs. You're setting a precedent here, and not inviting a parent to a wedding is explicitly cutting off a future relationship with them\n\nIt seems like you have tunnel vision at the moment, and you're going through something really stressful, so that makes sense. But don't do this. Instead of hurting your fiancee and ultimately taking away from your wedding day, try coming up with other ways to deal with it. For instance, having a conversation with your fiancee about her behavior or your fears. Or talking to your mom about the shitty comments your future MIL makes, and making sure your mom doesn't take it to heart and knows how important she is to you.\n\nTbh, if it's a small wedding with only your closest friends and families, she might not even be able to do much harm. It's not like she could get away with making snide comments to your guests, and if she tries to be involved in planning, just say that it's a small wedding and you don't need any help. Mitigate the problem - don't exacerbate it or hurt your fiancee.", "Hi OP. I'm so sorry you're going through this and I completely understand your point of view here so I'm only going to say a gentle YTA. You're viewing this wedding from a place of absolute emotional turmoil. You're losing your mother and this day has to be the perfect memory, I understand, I've been in similar circumstances (not a wedding) and experienced the crippling anxiety that comes with fearing something will happen to ruin it. However, this woman is your fianc\u00e9's mother and, like it or not, he has a right to have her there as well. So, the very first person you need to talk to is your fianc\u00e9, NOT to ask him not to invite her, but to explain your fears and ask him to help you navigate and head off any issues that might arise along the way. (Especially as it sounds like you'd want dad to attend as well). Give her an info diet about the planning details, set firm boundaries and expectations for the day, and then recruit one of his siblings to wrangle her. Allow her to become someone else's burden, and the two of you enjoy the day. I wish your mother all the best.", "YTA. You want your mother there, not allowing his is hypocritical.\n\nComing from a couple with difficult moms, we kept our engagement quiet, planned everything & booked it and told them so they didn't have room for input. Took a lot of stress off of us because we we already had the date, venue, etc all locked down. We kept it small, 30 people and no wedding party.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re not just marrying your fianc\u00e9. You\u2019re marrying into his family too. \n\nYou need to be on the same page and learn to deal with his mother together. What\u2019s life going to be like if you have children?\n\nYou need to air all your concerns and let him deal with his family. Depending on his actions, I\u2019d really consider if this really is what you want in your life. \n\nI couldn\u2019t have nightmare in laws in my life.", "NTA. If he is absolutely final on her being invited, don\u2019t tell her and surprise her when it\u2019s all planned. Or you can always elope with your parents present if you want. Less stress on you.", "OP, you are going to be dealing with her bulldhit gor many years to come, whether you're married or not. Now is the time to talk to your bf about setting boundaries for his mother. If you don't have him on your side, nothing is going to work. You both need to be on the same page and set the boundaries together, and then enforce them together. Anything other than this will bring division into your relationship. \n\nNot wanting her at the wedding does make YTA. Especially as you are doing so that your mother can be there. Set your boundaries and enforce them. If your bf is not on board, you may want to reconsider the relationship. She will be around for many years, making your life unhappy. \n\nGood luck", "YWBTA if you did that.  Put on your big girl panties, draw a hard line in the sand, and if she crosses it, shut her down ASAP.  If she starts that crap, then tell all three of them (her, her husband, and your bf) you don't want her there and point out exactly why.  Give her the benefit of the doubt, though.", "Yes you will.   \n\n\nHere's the thing, i get your idea to think of that, but it's not only your weeding, it's also your husband weeding and if he want his family you'll be a dick for that regardless of how much of a piece of work she is.  \nWant a better approach? Instead of telling him \"I DONT want them\", just express your concerns about it and see what's her stance on it. If he agree that she's a piece of work even when she love her she can do something about it. \n\nHe's willing to say fuck it let's do it now so you can see your mother in that special day. I'm sure you two can have a good conversation if you express your fear regarding her mother that could have a better result than \"I don't want them here\".", "Exactly. If he wants his parents there then make sure he knows (and he enforces this with his mother) that she is not to be involved with planning. She is simply to show up the day of and attend like everyone else. It\u2019s not fair to leave his parents out, plus it\u2019s not a realistic start to your future as part of their family too.", "If she has an opinion just say its all been set up and etched in stone. ...... if you hear a complaint, tell her the priest would like to hear it. Have the priest forewarned and ask him to keep her on a short Bible   \n quotes leash of sin.\n\nNTA.", "If I was OP I'd be angling for low contact with MIL. she sounds like a real piece of work.", "OP has a husband problem if he lets his mother talk about her that way or doesn\u2019t set boundaries (or enforce boundaries)", "I agree YTA. But work a plan so she isn\u2019t involved. \n\nInstead of getting engaged, do a surprise wedding. Plan an event (dinner or lunch) and announce you are actually getting married, then do it right then and there. You and fianc\u00e9 can plan what you want without her interference but she can be there for the event. \n\nAlso, any shit she gives you tell your fianc\u00e9 he is running interference or you and you MIL may end up being no contact after this.", "\u201cMaybe we can have a ceremony including his parents in a few years\u201d - her own mom\u2019s cancer diagnosis should be all the more lesson, we never know what can happen to friends and family in the blink of an eye\u2026 So she should suck it up and include everybody, for everybody\u2019s sake", "\"I have concerns...\" \n\nThis is the way.", "Low contact with a high maintenance MIL is still a lot lol", "I was just thinking this exact same thing. \n\nA surprise wedding is the perfect way to go.", "INFO: Why can\u2019t you guys do the planning without involving a lot of people (ie keep the MIL in the dark)? That way you can plan the wedding relatively peacefully and invite her and put up with the snide comments for the duration of the ceremony. \n\nAlso has your bf ever stood up to her and asked her to back off/tried to go LC if there is no reasoning with her anyway? Or is he a doormat and expects you to just put up with it like your FIL does?", "This. Ultimately the decision on whether or not to invite his mom is 100% his call.\n\nOr plan an engagement party\u2026 and just get married at the party so MIL has no idea it\u2019s coming. She\u2019ll be pissed afterwards, but you can avoid the lead-up fiasco.\n\nOP also needs to have a frank conversation with her boyfriend about how they\u2019re going to handle the MIL dynamic after they get married. Being married to someone with a narcissist mother is hard enough, but being married to someone who is spineless with a narcissist mother is an absolute deal breaker. Relationships don\u2019t survive that."]}
