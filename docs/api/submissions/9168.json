Your wedding, therefore your choice. Call your brother and let him know that you are sorry but the venue dictates that there be a restricted number and there is only space for him, his wife, and their 3 children for their invite. You cannot magically make an extra place appear as you have to follow venue rules and you've already filled the allowed numbers with the rest of your invitees. You might want to contact the venue (and wedding planner if you have one) and let them know you are telling family that there is a venue number limit so that if anyone asks someone from the venue about their number limits, they know to answer correctly so that your brother doesn't throw a snit at your wedding. You might also ask why they thought it was okay to change the number for them without at least calling you and talking to you about it as she was clearly NOT invited on their invitation (assuming you addressed it to Mr. and Mrs. \\[Name\\] and family).", "YWNBTA to send your brother a note reminding him that there are unfortunately only 5 seats for him and his family, so you are confirming that the attendees will be himself, his wife, and his three children.", "NTA.

Inform them that they aren't the only ones who want to bring extra guests, just the only ones entitled enough to assume they can invite some stranger to someone elses party.

Generally when issuing invitations, you invite named humans, rather that saying \"hey, bro - I've reserved you five spots\". But apparently you didn't do that. Do you want your brother to leave his family at home and show up to your wedding with four random golfing buddies, or do you actually want his family there?\n\nYour brother then took it upon himself to reply indicating that he was bringing a random additional person. This is the height of rudeness. You don't just invite extra people to someone else's party. \n\nIf your brother has a genuine reason to want to add to his party (perhaps his son has recently become engaged, and he wished to inform you, because you apparently weren't aware) then he can call you or write to you and tell you, and then normal social rules would oblige you to invite his son's fiancee.\n\nBut his son is 16, and is neither engaged to his girlfriend, nor cohabiting with her.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYour wedding, your rules", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I cannot count the number of weddings I was drug to as a child and sometimes forced to participate in. Sooooo boring. I barely knew these people - aunts, uncles, parents friends.
