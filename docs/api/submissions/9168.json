Regardless of who the extra is (though I agree a gf of a teen is pretty ridiculous), you didn\u2019t give them a \u201cplus 1\u201d so they\u2019re to abide by their number by wedding etiquette standards.", "NTA. Even if they had asked, there's no reason for a teenager's girlfriend to come to a family wedding.", "NTA.  \nIt\u2019s your wedding. No one is entitled to be there, and the fact the he just assumed she could come is the issue here. Wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if he had just asked.

Your wedding, therefore your choice. Call your brother and let him know that you are sorry but the venue dictates that there be a restricted number and there is only space for him, his wife, and their 3 children for their invite. You cannot magically make an extra place appear as you have to follow venue rules and you've already filled the allowed numbers with the rest of your invitees. You might want to contact the venue (and wedding planner if you have one) and let them know you are telling family that there is a venue number limit so that if anyone asks someone from the venue about their number limits, they know to answer correctly so that your brother doesn't throw a snit at your wedding. You might also ask why they thought it was okay to change the number for them without at least calling you and talking to you about it as she was clearly NOT invited on their invitation (assuming you addressed it to Mr. and Mrs. \\[Name\\] and family).", "YWNBTA to send your brother a note reminding him that there are unfortunately only 5 seats for him and his family, so you are confirming that the attendees will be himself, his wife, and his three children.", "NTA. Your wedding is not your nephew's social event. It's not a party they get to dress up and go out together for. It's a celebration of the new family you are starting together, not prom night for them to have a fancy dinner date on someone else's dime. \n\nSay she can't come. Inform them that they aren't the only ones who want to bring extra guests, just the only ones entitled enough to assume they can invite some stranger to someone elses party. And make them sign an attendance contract where they pay $200 for her meal, they swear to keep her out of group photos, and if they break up they will pay for her professional removal from any photos she is in should she just \"turn up\" at the wedding \"uninvited\".\n\nYour nephew is his parents to deal with. I'm guessing that either the boy, his girlfriend, or both, have said they won't go unless they both go. Or that your brother just doesn't want to hear his son whining about his girlfriend not being there. Make him deal.", "NTA. However, maybe consider letting her come to the reception after dinner has been served if you\u2019re doing that? It is your wedding but could potentially save some drama. Either way definitely talk to your brother and explain to the kid why that was not okay in the first place.", "This whole post is weird.\n\nYou invited your brother and his family to your wedding. Generally when issuing invitations, you invite named humans, rather that saying \"hey, bro - I've reserved you five spots\". But apparently you didn't do that. Do you want your brother to leave his family at home and show up to your wedding with four random golfing buddies, or do you actually want his family there?\n\nYour brother then took it upon himself to reply indicating that he was bringing a random additional person. This is the height of rudeness. You don't just invite extra people to someone else's party. \n\nIf your brother has a genuine reason to want to add to his party (perhaps his son has recently become engaged, and he wished to inform you, because you apparently weren't aware) then he can call you or write to you and tell you, and then normal social rules would oblige you to invite his son's fiancee.\n\nBut his son is 16, and is neither engaged to his girlfriend, nor cohabiting with her.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYour wedding, your rules", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I cannot count the number of weddings I was drug to as a child and sometimes forced to participate in. Sooooo boring. I barely knew these people - aunts, uncles, parents friends. I would have been much happier if I could have brought along someone I knew. Or better yet, it would have been awesome if a loving relative would have said, \u201c I will not be offended if your children choose not to attend.\u201d  As an adult I often say I will bless you with a gift and my absence.
