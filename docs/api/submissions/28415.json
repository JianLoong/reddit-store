He is originally from the US but moved to Europe a few years ago which is where we met and both live. Currently however, we are in the US visiting his family for the first time which has been a nightmare for one specific reason. \n\nI've been a vegetarian for years now and since before I met Dan. It hasn't really been an issue for our relationship so far, he doesn't seem to mind eating vegetarian/ vegan when I cook and I'm fine with him preparing some meat for himself when he cooks. I asked him to talk to his parents about me being vegetarian and whether it'd be an issue when we visit but he told me it was going to be fine. \n\nWell, we arrive in the US and it has been anything but fine. He never told his parents which became apparent the first morning when his mother was preparing breakfast and I declined having some bacon.   \nShe was shocked to find out I don't eat meat since she was planning on preparing a bunch of traditional dishes from the area (that all contain meat), and his dad was planning to host a barbecue for us. I told them I'm really sorry but I really don't feel comfortable eating meat. I told them I was happy to eat sides or buy and prepare my own food if that wasn't possible, or that I could cook something vegetarian for everybody to eat. None of my suggestions have been received well. \n\nDuring dinner, his mom would sometimes put meat on my plate (despite me declining) that I would then awkwardly leave. The mood has been really tense constantly because of this. Yesterday after another awkward dinner, Dan seemed angry and barely talked to me. I asked what was going on when we were alone and he told me that I'm really taking my vegetarianism too far. Meat apparently is a big part of the culture and I'm really insulting his parents by not even trying any. I am apparently leaving a really bad impression and should change my behaviour and apologize.\n\nI really don't know what to do tbh. I don't eat meat for a number of reasons (none of them health related though) so I really can't imagine having any. But if I'm stepping all over important cultural values that of course is really disrespectful of me as well. So AITA for not trying any of the meat Dan's mom prepared?", "created_utc": 1696665430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1720qk7/aita_for_not_even_trying_local_cuisine/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Eventually they will get the picture.\n\nThis just reminded me of when my brother and his wife stopped eating beef and pork.  So my mother, the greatest host I have ever met, started cooking chicken for Sunday family dinners.  However, when my SIL got pregnant, she started craving roast beef, and my mom was ecstatic!  She could serve beef again.  Now, to put this into perspective, she grew up in the depression very very poor, and she knew she had finally made it to middle class when she could put a roast beef on the table every week.\n\nAs for taking vegetarianism too far?

We do meat, and we do carbs-- and carbs are very vegetarian! Do keep an eye out though, because some apparently vegetarian Southern dishes can involve hidden meat (e.g. baked beans with bacon) or meat-related products such as lard (some baked goods). But even then, there are PLENTY of dishes that just involve milk and eggs and delicious, delicious carbs. Being *vegan* might be a little more difficult, but being vegetarian in the South is easy! \n\nRegarding the barbecue, it's super easy to throw a veggie burger on the grill. We have easily accessible black bean burgers, tofu burgers, etc. Impossible-branded meat replacement products are very common in the US now, to the point that even Burger King sells Impossible burgers! (If you get one there, though, make sure to ask that they cook it separately from the meat burgers, because otherwise there will be cross-contamination.) There are veggie sausages, and you can grill veggie skewers. The sides, like potato salad, macaroni salad, and cole slaw, are also usually vegetarian by default. So it is super easy to accommodate for a vegetarian diet at a BBQ; they just don't *want* to.\n\nThe issue here isn't really their culture at all, but the fact that they refuse to make even the slightest accommodation for you when our culture makes it very easy to do so.
