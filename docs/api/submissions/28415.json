He is originally from the US but moved to Europe a few years ago which is where we met and both live. Currently however, we are in the US visiting his family for the first time which has been a nightmare for one specific reason. \n\nI've been a vegetarian for years now and since before I met Dan. It hasn't really been an issue for our relationship so far, he doesn't seem to mind eating vegetarian/ vegan when I cook and I'm fine with him preparing some meat for himself when he cooks. I asked him to talk to his parents about me being vegetarian and whether it'd be an issue when we visit but he told me it was going to be fine. \n\nWell, we arrive in the US and it has been anything but fine. He never told his parents which became apparent the first morning when his mother was preparing breakfast and I declined having some bacon.   \nShe was shocked to find out I don't eat meat since she was planning on preparing a bunch of traditional dishes from the area (that all contain meat), and his dad was planning to host a barbecue for us. I told them I'm really sorry but I really don't feel comfortable eating meat. I told them I was happy to eat sides or buy and prepare my own food if that wasn't possible, or that I could cook something vegetarian for everybody to eat. None of my suggestions have been received well. \n\nDuring dinner, his mom would sometimes put meat on my plate (despite me declining) that I would then awkwardly leave. The mood has been really tense constantly because of this. Yesterday after another awkward dinner, Dan seemed angry and barely talked to me. I asked what was going on when we were alone and he told me that I'm really taking my vegetarianism too far. Meat apparently is a big part of the culture and I'm really insulting his parents by not even trying any. I am apparently leaving a really bad impression and should change my behaviour and apologize.\n\nI really don't know what to do tbh. I don't eat meat for a number of reasons (none of them health related though) so I really can't imagine having any. But if I'm stepping all over important cultural values that of course is really disrespectful of me as well. So AITA for not trying any of the meat Dan's mom prepared?", "created_utc": 1696665430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1720qk7/aita_for_not_even_trying_local_cuisine/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His family is rude. Putting meat on your plate when you've said you're a vegetarian is obnoxious, and being angry at you for not eating it is just that much worse.

He doesn't consider vegetarianism a part of you, he sees it as you being picky.

A long term vegetarian trying meat is going to have digestive issues whether or not your original reasons were health related. Your BF should recognize this and not ask you to feel I\u2019ll to please his mommy. BF should also grow a spine and stick up for you. That he hasn\u2019t speaks volumes; are you listening? And finally, in the USA it is considered rude to force guests to eat food they are uncomfortable with, same as in Europe. As for what you should do, my answer is ask Dan wtf he was thinking, where he sees this relationship going, and why he won\u2019t support you against his mommy. And do all that while planning your exit from his parent\u2019s house and your return home.", "NTA.

Eating meat is a choice.  Not a \"value.\"  \n\nYour bf and his family are being very backward and closed-minded.  Vegetarianism has been a \"thing\" in the US for ages.  This isn't some new-age thing and for them to act like it is, or that it's some sort of slap in the face to US \"cultural values\" is beyond stupid.    \n\n\nI'm sorry that your boyfriend is being a dinkus.", "NTA.

It sounds like he did absolutely nothing to prepare them for having a vegetarian guest, and is now trying to make you look like the one making things difficult.

For example in the south you might have fried green tomatoes, deviled eggs, red beans and rice, collard greens, macaroni and cheese, anything involving sweet potatoes, hoppin john... not to mention we have just good regular fruits and veggies. There are PLENTY of ways you could be included in their meal plans without them making extreme changes, and it would be the easiest thing in the world to just go to the grocery store and get hummus, almond butter and other easy things for you to eat. And all of that can easily be incorporated into their plans, as side dishes at their barbeque, etc. \n\nThis was so easily avoidable if your partner had just communicated with them beforehand.", "NTA.\n\nYou weren\u2019t eating meat.

The quintessential southern restaurant, Cracker Barrel, literally has something like fifteen different vegetables and a plate that specifically allows you to pick four as a meal.\n\nNTA.

Tbh if he doesnt have your back on this expect this in the future too. What else will he suddenly have a problem with when someone else brings it up. I dont know your guys relationship but this wouldnt feel right to me. Im from the states and yes its true meat is a big thing here. But hospitality usually is too. And i was raised that when a guest in your home has special dietary needs regardless of the reasons you try to cater to that to the best of your ability. You gave solutions but they seemingly didnt want solutions they want you to eat meat regardless if it goes against your very morals. And id bet that he didnt tell his parents because he knew how they would react. It didnt just casually slip the mind of someone who says meat is a big part of their and their families culture.", "NTA. Dan and family sure are. Are you sure you want to be with this guy?", "NTA.

You're vegetarian, the reasons why don't matter, but why does your bf think he has the right to try to force you to eat meat just because his family do.

I\u2019m a vegetarian from Germany and we also eat much meat which means I also don\u2019t eat the local kitchen here. I just eat the sides or pick out the meat and give it to someone else.

His mom trying to force it on you sort of shows me where he gets it from. And I'm really not okay with Dan knowing ahead of time, not telling his parents, and going along with them trying to guilt/shame you into defying your ethics.\n\nI'm not even vegan/vegetarian, but this would piss me off either way.

I understand saying it is mature to try things but there is a limit. I have been vegetarian for 10 years, and I became vegetarian because I tried plenty of meat and fish and didn't like any of it, texture, smell taste, was just incredibley off putting, so telling me that the \"grownup\" thing to do is try it won't help because I've had BBQ beef before and don't like it, fried chicken, can't stand it. And why is it grown up to bully people until they do what you want. I understand food as culture, but that doesn't include individual ingredients. Southern fried coating can be put on vegetarian foods, veggie food can be BBQ'd."]}
