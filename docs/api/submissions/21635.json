As in, has this been going on for a lot longer than you first thought?\n\nI know it sounds odd, but adults who are dyslexic, cannot read, or read very poorly have developed techniques to get around reading.", "NTA", "Nta, and I dont think she can legally stop.you from seeing your dad. Your life will probably be easier if you comply, because she has power over you, but you don't have to", "NTA. I find it majorly ironic that your mom complains that you don't communicate when she deliberately ignores the device designed specifically for communication that has the info that she wants communicated.\n\nWhat makes this even more ironic is that Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa & Bixby (the Samsung Siri/Alex wannabe) all have the capability to both read abd send text messages on voice command. All she has to do (after setting it up) is talk to her phone.\n\nWhat it really sounds like is that she wants you to do all of the work of communicating for her so that she has to do nothing.\n\nWhich is going to come back and bite her in the posterior in a few years.\n\nYou're 16. Within a couple of years, you'll be going off to college. (hopefully away from your mom's home.) You won't be there to communicate for her. (and may never want to move back in to have to take up that role again.)\n\nYou sound to have a younger sister still at home also. But at some point, she'll be moving out too.\n\nIf your mom does not start making an effort to do her own communicating before the both of you leave home, she may find that she never hears from you or any of your siblings... because all y'all find it too much effort to actually get ahold of her.", "ESH \n\nYou suck, because it\u2019s literally five seconds out of your time to keep your mom updated on when your dad is meant to be there. It sounds like that\u2019s your only job when she has a ton of other things to do that she isn\u2019t getting any help with, and that\u2019s probably what\u2019s contributing to her stress.\n\nYour mom sucks because that\u2019s a serious overreaction and threatening to cut off contact with your dad because of a miscommunication is straight up emotional abuse. \n\nYou both need help learning to communicate better.

You are not wrong in wanting your mom to read text, but from what you wrote you\u2019re just being bratty and difficult. \n\nYou know damn well that your mom is not good with phone and she might be busy with house chores. What is with the \u201cmention dinner invitation to her when you see her around the house\u201d. What if you didn\u2019t see her? Will you make an effort to go all the way downstairs to notify her?

Also  you complained that she doesn\u2019t get ready in advance but neither does you.  How is going \u201call the way downstairs\u201d preventing you from getting ready?
