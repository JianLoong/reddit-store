If sister needs help to get ready and mom needs to get ready and  x,y,z needs to happen, then in our house expectation is that everyone else helps with sister and x,y,z. If they just wait for the magical house fairies  (aka parents) to do it and get themselves ready, they aren\u2019t actually productive members of the team.\n\nThe way we look at it: kids don\u2019t have to be productive members of the team but parents don\u2019t have to do all the stuff their kids want either. If kids want parents to have energy to drive them places and play games together etc, then they have to step up.\n\nAnyway, OP my advice to you is to have a chat with your mom. The situation here is not good - your mom is becoming verbally abusive and clearly not coping well with the situation. You should talk about what she expects to happen in this scenario. Figure out a new strategy. Ask your dad to help. (But as the kid it\u2019s not your responsibility to fix this. Still worth trying.)\n\nNTA", "[removed]", "NTA because she yelled. But personally I think everyone can have their preferences, and if your mom clearly doesn't use her phone texting her is obviously not the best way to get the message across. Try calling. Or even just shouting across the house.

Some people aren't slaves to their phones, and sending a text you know they aren't going to read really isn't fair when you are communicating information they have a right to know. \n\nTexting pictures of your cat - who cares. Letting her know you're leaving the house, where you're going and when you'll return - YOU need to communicate that. And it's YOUR responsibility to make sure that message gets through. It's not on the other party to use the communication method that you prefer. \n\nIf your dad expects your mom to join you all, then he needs to call her with the invite. It is his job to communicate with her, not yours. Don't accept the scolding from your mother, tell her to take it up with your dad.", "NTA - your mother is an adult and is more then capable of keeping track of her messages.

And anything else related is on OP. That's not good. What IS good is that unlike OP, he has control of the whole situation as the plan maker.\n\nSeems like after plans are figured out in group chat (with only OP) he's not touching base (confirming/ informing/ double checking/ whatever u want to call it) w OP's mom. If he can take over an hour to make the plan then he can def do a five second phone call to OP's mom like \"hey check the group chat\" or \"picking up in 2 hours.\" once plans are made.\nThat'd literally solve the whole problem and frankly that's just typical planning behavior and he's likely aware of that from employment. I don't care if he's a CEO or a drug dealer lol...\n\nHe informs (and later, he even confirms!) a relevant pick up time with a client and CCs a coworker for backup.. or runs a meeting time by a supervisor who requested a one-on-one. Maybe he's double checked or touched base with his team regarding his project deadlines so they know when works best for their own deadlines.\nPeople indirectly involved are \"in the loop\" and he gets that concept if he's adult enough to have a 16 yr old and he's employed enough to treat her to dinner. \n\nSo why the fuck does he suck so much at planning on this front lol it's no different. If anything, it's even more pertinent to be effective when dealing with parenting stuff.  \n\nI'm sure he's a good person and dad and all.

She can handle that np. but srsly wanting all that texting while she's taking care of at home things is fuckin telling.

A silent phone wouldn't notify you of anything, even a phone call. \n\nA text allows you to finish doing something (like cleaning a toilet) then to answer when you can. A phone call during a busy time means the person has to make a choice, and they may not choose the phone call.\n\nA text notification is the same as a phone call notification, and if YOU keep failing to check messages,  YOU should add something to your phone to fix that. But I assume the mom doesn't ignore all the messages she gets, especially the ones not from her ex.\n\n\n\n>So checking texts is a daily task? Then checking once a day is sufficient. If it's something more time sensitive, use a method of communication that intrudes on the consciousness, like a phone call.\n\nOnce a day is sufficient? Sure if you want to but most people with a functioning brain check their phone a few times a day, especially once it goes off.\n\nIf you are having trouble checking your phone, may I suggest loud speaker so that you hear your phone more?\n\nI'm awaiting a reply from this thrilling Convo :)", "A text message gives one notice and is easily missed if focused on something else. A phone call rings for a minute. Notifications for the two aren't even close to the same.\n\nFor a group text, it's even more easily missed because there are a lot of texts that are not always relevant to every member, and it begins easy to block them out. Group text notifications are like the boy who cried wolf.\n\n>Once a day is sufficient? Sure if you want to\n\nYou are the one who called it a daily task. If it's a daily task, then they are only expected to do it daily.\n\nTexts are simply an inadequate means of conveying time-sensitive information.\n\nI have no trouble \"checking my phone.\" But if you want to convey time sensitive information, use a high-interrupt method of getting it to me, don't assume my schedule of checking my phone matches the schedule you want.", ">If they ignore a text, they'll ignore a phone call but blaming this all on the daughter is insane.\n\n>Do you think the mom routinely fails at daily tasks or is just when her ex is involved?\n\n>This was a text notification and you seemed ok to get it\n\nThis seems to be the bit you are stuck on:\n\n>Do you think the mom routinely fails at daily tasks or is just when her ex is involved?\n\n\nThe daily tasks part isn't a out checking her phone once a day, it's about remembering to do the daily things you need to do to survive/live. If the mom doesn't need help remembering any of that, and she only needs a hand when it comes to her ex, the mom is abusive. \n\n>Texts are simply an inadequate means of conveying time-sensitive information\n\nIf there are hours within the day left to convey this message, no, it is fine. How often does the mom ignore her phone for hours, or once again is it just because the ex is involved?", "NTA.  Your mom is doing what is called weaponized incompetence.  Read up on it, understanding it might better help you handle it.", "Yep NTA. Tell mom to get an Apple Watch so her texts show up on her wrist. No excuses then", "Idk but adding someone to a group chat and they never use their phone to text is simply asking for bullshit like this to happen.", "Yes. If that is the case, it was always going to fail. \n\nI'm also wondering how any communication is supposed to be done with the ex/father of her children also now too. (If the phone things true)"]}
