But here your dad is just as much T A as your mom. \n\nHe\u2019s got to know she\u2019s not seeing the texts since she\u2019s not responding, and it sounds like this is an ongoing pattern. Your parents are putting you in the middle of their own dispute about how to plan and their own inability to communicate as adults. \n\nJust leave the group chat. Tell both of them that you\u2019re tired of being in the middle of the Dinner Planning Battle and of getting yelled at. They need to work out how to communicate about dinner between themselves - this is not your job as their child. Once they make plans, they can text you to let you know what time to be ready and what the dress code is (or whatever the important info is).

Why is it your job then to tell your mom?\n\nI understand her frustration with being communicated with by chat texts, it can be annoying especially to the older generation for whom it's not so natural (of course it depends on how fast they learnt to use technology). I also hate it when I can be called and told something instead of checking my phone beeping anytime during the day. \n\nAlso - chats show usually who read the text, can't your dad check whether your mom read it or not, and if not - give her a freaking call?\n\nIf it's such a usual problem, why do you still do it this was? Spontaneous dinners discussed in the group chat which is almost never seen by your mom.\n\nI just ask because I love my mom enough (she knows how to use a phone) to tell her when there is something important when I may think that she missed the invitation.\n\nHer frustration is over the top (by a lot) but maybe she has a feeling you guys do it on purpose and she didn't really mean you are not allowed to see your dad, but just got angry and said something stupid?\n\nAlso - if your mom is busy with housework/cooking I can see how her phone chats are not priority, so if she actually is getting exhausted, I don't think it would hurt you to give her a heads up.", "NTA", "Your mom is doing this intentionally.
