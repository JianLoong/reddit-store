(22F) have been friends since middle school, although she has always been an absolute attention seeker. For example: she referred as herself as a \u201ccured\u201d BPD case, though she never had to take any meds, was never hospitalized nor she had a diagnosis. This was painful to me, as a diagnosed BPD person, knowing that you can\u2019t actually \u201cbe cured\u201d from a PD. She lacked empathy, for sure, but I saw these behaviours like her own way to ask for help, so I stayed in the friendship, inviting her over and everything, since she always had little to no friends because of her actions. \nLong story short, I invited her and her bf over for new years eve in my new home.\nSome weeks later, L. texted me, crying and saying they were over. I asked her more and she told me that he kept texting with some girls he slept with years before.\nI proceeded then saying that she deserved more and so on. Then she suddently came more and more aggressively at me, trying to justify him, saying that her therapist told her he could be a pathological narcissist. I wasn\u2019t convinced but I told her that this \u201cdiagnosis\u201d wouldn\u2019t give him a free pass to treat her like shit. She then cut the conversation. \nA few days later, I saw a tt video about narcissistic behavior. Didn\u2019t think twice and I sent it to her, just to let her know I was supportive of her, thinking she would talk to me again if she thought I was more into her theory. \nShe then burst into a cold blooded rage and sent me angry texts asking how dare would I diagnose her bf, that she didnt need my stupid opinion. I was in shock. I asked her if this was some kind of joke, that I NEVER diagnosed him and so on. \nShe then blocked me, and I, of course, felt very triggered. None of my friends was responding my texts (since it was early in the morning) so I posted an Instagram rant. I wasn\u2019t thinking and I was deeply hurt and I posted one censored screenshot (that I took down after a few hours, when I eventually calmed down)in which was very clear that she told me he was a \u201cdiagnosed\u201d narcissist and that I was trying to talk her out of it. None could know who this person was but me and my friends and I have just a few followers on social media and I know for a fact that NONE reached out to her, except for me, apologizing for the stories and asking her to talk about this whole misunderstanding. \nA few months later, I get a call from the PD near my new house. They got a lawsuit filed against me. I went there and they told me L. filed a police report in which she said I cyberbullied her. They also said she didnt file a true lawsuit because she didnt have any proof and just wanted to spooke me. \nShe even gave the police the address I gave her to come to my party, which is not the correct one.\nAfter that crazy morning, I started thinking posting the stories was the right call. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I am a non native english speaker. Where I live, there\u2019s something called \u201cesposto\u201d, which is tecnically just an attempt to get an agreement between two civil parts. You can do it without any proofs of the act (for example, if the old lady downstairs is complaining about your dog barking, she can go to the cops and file this exact type of complaint). When the cops called me, they used a generic term and I got scared. But then when I got there they explained to me that this was basically nothing. I said lawsuit just because I am a non native speaker.", "created_utc": 1667342847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjnxch/aita_for_posting_some_anonymous_screenshot/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was clearly having a rough time and you post that she's acting crazy on social media. Yeah you're an AH.  Talk to her, complain to people in person, but don't post that on social media.  She also sucks for going to the police about this instead of talking to you.  It sounds like a bad situation that both of you handled poorly", "I live in Italy and english is not my native language. I got the call from the police, the precise name of what she filed is \u201cesposto\u201d, which means exposed. It\u2019s kind of a police report, but it has no repercussions as it\u2019s just a \u201cchat between two civil contendants\u201d since there are no proofs of the fact. To bring an example, if the old lady downstairs wants to complain about your dog barking, she will file this exact type of police report.", "OPs from a different country.
