Evie is from the USA but has lived here since she was 17yrs old. Evie and I hate eachother so much that I'm surprised we even have babies together. (We were drunk). Evie attends the same top university as me, but her family are struggling with student fees  So she thought asking me for money(not a loan) would be ok . I told her no, and asking for that much money was rude.\nJust to clarify, my sisters and I (triplets) inherited a ton of money when we were 16. We all use it to further our education and improve our lifestyle.(back to Evie). She went ballistic and called me a horrible father for not wanting to help the mother of my girls. Her family is constantly harassing me, saying I must help out their daughter. At the same time, they are hounding me to pay up just because it won't dent my bank account. My sisters tell me it's not my responsibility to help her and think she should drop out if money is the issue. I also don't believe that it should be my job to help with her education, even though it's technically accurate that it won't make a dent. The only reason I'm doubting myself is because she's my daughters mother.\nUsually I would ignore these kinds of people, but it's impossible with these specific people. I want to say fuck off in their faces, but don't I'm not in the mood to stir up trouble. So AITA for refusing to pay a penny towards her university.\n\nSorry if this sounds rushed, I'm just sick.\n\nI live in UK. We have child maintenance not child support. Parents who share equal custody (which we do) don't have to pay any child maintenance aslong as you children are provided for.\n\nUpdate: I just want to make it clear that I offered Evie a loan but she refused it. She doesn't want any legal paper work attached to the money.\n\nUpdate: If she took my children away to the USA for more than 28 days then my children have been abducted. UK law stands and other countries including USA have agreed.\n\nUpdate: Evie will not go back to the USA. She's not that stupid to get in more legal trouble or that stupid to piss me off. I don't want to hate Evie but unless she changes for the better I can't stop hating her. Can she go to USA with our children. Yes. But am I actually going to let her life their with my kids. He'll no. She can live her fairy tale life for a year at most but at the end of the day she will be arrested. UK law wil not be ignored internationally.

I'd like to see you never have to communicate directly with her or her family again. \n\n2) Draft a notice from your attorney that you will provide $x for her education and that you will pay for your children's college education in exchange for her utilizing the third party system, but that you won't be providing any additional housing, medical or otherwise support. If at any point she is unable to house the kids you'll take them for full custody.\n\n3) Realistically, as you move forward in your career and future relationships, give some thought to how you want to balance parenthood vs support.
