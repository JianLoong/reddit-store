We are both straight and married to people our ages. Anyway when we worked together we had lunch together a couple times a week and enjoyed each other\u2019s company. Eventually it moved outside of work and spouses met and I genuinely liked his wife. We\u2019d either do things as two couples, or occasionally he and I would hang out alone, he\u2019d hang out with my husband or I\u2019d hang out with his wife, depending on the activity. One thing that we bonded over was music, and so sometimes the activity was concerts. He introduced me to a local band that has pretty regular monthly concerts. Typically our spouses would come but occasionally one or both couldn\u2019t come for whatever reason, no big deal. \n\nAnyway, we stopped working together about two years ago and the friendship continued until about a year ago. One day I get a call from my former coworker and he says that his wife thinks we\u2019re having an affair and he\u2019s not allowed to talk to me anymore and I should not contact them ever again. I was upset because I did genuinely like them both and I don\u2019t like being accused of things I didn\u2019t do, but also I\u2019m way too old for this drama so I let it drop.\n\nI still see them both around occasionally at the grocery store or wherever. We\u2019ve kept it cordial and said hello but not much more. One place we saw each other more often than not was concerts, especially for this local band. Anyway, again we\u2019ve kept it cordial. The last time I saw them, about a week ago, they even offered me a seat with them, but I was meeting friends so I declined. Because they seemed to be offering an olive branch, I did go say hi at the set break and ask after their kids and they asked after mine and it was fine, or so I thought. \n\nA few days later I got a call from my former coworker asking me if I\u2019d text him every time I plan to go to a concert from now on because he\u2019s no longer allowed to go to any if I may be there. And I said that I\u2019m not enabling this toxic bullsh*t and to never contact me again. He complained that I was putting him in an impossible position and now he can\u2019t do something he loves because of me. I said no, he can\u2019t do it anymore because his wife is a crazy b-word, which was the end of the conversation. And I typically don\u2019t lose my cool like that and I\u2019m not sure why the request made me so mad, because it\u2019s not a big deal to text him if I\u2019m going to a concert, but I really just don\u2019t like the whole situation.

He\u2019d wanna know your schedule to avoid you and his wife talking too long and realising that 1)you don\u2019t hang out at all and haven\u2019t for so long and 2)it\u2019s because he said his wife thought you\u2019d were having an affair.\n\n It all just sounds fishy that she\u2019s be so nice to you so often and not make it clear if she\u2019s so insistent that you can\u2019t even be at concerts together where she was also present. Next time you see them I\u2019d just bring up a casual \u201csorry for any awkwardness on my part last time I saw you just given the situation(alleged affair) it\u2019s been hard knowing where we stand but I do miss our friendship (extend this fully to the wife and mention the alleged affair accusations)\u201d I\u2019d be interested to know if she even said anything, maybe she\u2019d apologise or maybe she\u2019d realise he\u2019d been lying about a lot.\n\nHe probably nearly got caught cheating and used you as a cover and then cut ties to avoid being caught knowing he\u2019d have a cover story. Just weird she\u2019s apparently so insecure and convinced that he can\u2019t go anywhere if you\u2019re there and you\u2019ve to constantly text him you\u2019re schedule instead of having you blocked.", "[removed]", "NTA.

You got upset because when he told you not to contact him. You didn't. You're obviously going to be cordial in public.\n\nHis conflict is between him and his wife. Neither has an entitlement to information about your schedule. They can decide to buy groceries or not, listen to a band or not. It has nothing to fo with you.\n\nGiving him your schedule will further convince his wife you're having an affair.\n\nYour error was not blocking him when he told you never to contact him again. His was not deleting your contact info and contacting you.\n\nI wonder if his wife is cheating.", "What's the bet that if you DID agree and text him when you were going to a concert - you'd then be blamed for texting him?", "NTA - His wife is a bit crazy and that is her husband's problem, not yours.

She's an insecure narcissist who sees every woman as a threat. He, meanwhile, habitually hides everything from her so that he can enjoy some freedom. He treats her like a force of nature or an angry god and can't even imagine defying her openly.\n\nThey should divorce, but he's a spineless worm who is more terrified of having to make his own decisions than he is of living his life under her thumb. I have no sympathy for him, nor for the guy in question.\n\nIf the wife in the post is anything like the one I know then she doesn't actually think he had an affair, she just sensed that he genuinely liked a woman who wasn't her and that was offensive and threatening enough to forbid him to have any contact with her.\n\nI'm not surprised the wife is openly nice, since narcissists are obsessed with their image and it would make then look bad to be rude or confrontational. The offer of a seat at their table is a trap, though, since the wife would probably snipe at OP.", "Ohhh that's actually a good theory. OP's exfriend had a crush on OP and made up all this drama to bond with her. Some people has the strange tendency to use drama as a way of... flirting?", "While I agree that that's a possibility, as my grandmomma would say, that juice just ain't worth the squeeze.\n\nAt very least one of the two in that couple is unhinged and OP needs to stay the hell away from both of them.
