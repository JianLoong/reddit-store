We are both straight and married to people our ages. Anyway when we worked together we had lunch together a couple times a week and enjoyed each other\u2019s company. Eventually it moved outside of work and spouses met and I genuinely liked his wife. We\u2019d either do things as two couples, or occasionally he and I would hang out alone, he\u2019d hang out with my husband or I\u2019d hang out with his wife, depending on the activity. One thing that we bonded over was music, and so sometimes the activity was concerts. He introduced me to a local band that has pretty regular monthly concerts. Typically our spouses would come but occasionally one or both couldn\u2019t come for whatever reason, no big deal. \n\nAnyway, we stopped working together about two years ago and the friendship continued until about a year ago. One day I get a call from my former coworker and he says that his wife thinks we\u2019re having an affair and he\u2019s not allowed to talk to me anymore and I should not contact them ever again. I was upset because I did genuinely like them both and I don\u2019t like being accused of things I didn\u2019t do, but also I\u2019m way too old for this drama so I let it drop.\n\nI still see them both around occasionally at the grocery store or wherever. We\u2019ve kept it cordial and said hello but not much more. One place we saw each other more often than not was concerts, especially for this local band. Anyway, again we\u2019ve kept it cordial. The last time I saw them, about a week ago, they even offered me a seat with them, but I was meeting friends so I declined. Because they seemed to be offering an olive branch, I did go say hi at the set break and ask after their kids and they asked after mine and it was fine, or so I thought. \n\nA few days later I got a call from my former coworker asking me if I\u2019d text him every time I plan to go to a concert from now on because he\u2019s no longer allowed to go to any if I may be there. And I said that I\u2019m not enabling this toxic bullsh*t and to never contact me again. He complained that I was putting him in an impossible position and now he can\u2019t do something he loves because of me. I said no, he can\u2019t do it anymore because his wife is a crazy b-word, which was the end of the conversation. And I typically don\u2019t lose my cool like that and I\u2019m not sure why the request made me so mad, because it\u2019s not a big deal to text him if I\u2019m going to a concert, but I really just don\u2019t like the whole situation.
