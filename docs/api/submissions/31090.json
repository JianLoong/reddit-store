He is the result of my dad\u2019s affair with another woman when I was a kid. My dad left my mom and me for his mistress and started a new family with her. He never paid any child support or alimony, and he rarely contacted me. He basically abandoned me and chose his new family over me.  \nMy mom raised me by herself and worked hard to provide for me. She passed away last year from cancer and left me everything she had, which was not much, but enough to pay off my student loans and buy a small apartment. I was devastated by her death and I miss her every day.  \nA few weeks ago, I got a call from my dad\u2019s mistress, who is now his wife. She told me that my dad had died in a traffic accident and that he had left a will. Apparently, he had inherited a lot of money from his parents and had a successful business. He left half of his estate to his wife and the other half to his sons, me and my half-brother. However, he also left a note saying that he wanted me to meet his family to get the money and forgive him saying that he regretted not being a good father to me. He asked his lawyer and wife to contact me and make me aware that he had left me a substantial portion of the inheritance.  \nI was shocked and angry when I heard this. I hate him trying to buy my forgiveness with his money, after ignoring me for most of my life. I told his wife that I didn\u2019t want anything from him and that I wanted nothing to do with them. She sounded hurt and said that they were just trying to honor his wishes and that they wanted to get to know me and be a family. She said that my half-brother was looking forward to meeting me and that he was willing to share \"his\" inheritance with me. She asked me to reconsider and give them a chance.  \nI hung up on her and blocked her number. I don\u2019t want to have any contact with them. I don\u2019t care about the money or the family. I only care about my mom, who was the only parent I ever had. She was the one who loved me and supported me, and she was the one who deserved the inheritance, not them. I dont want them to have it either though, it seems as if I am promised around 25% and I would rather have the money go to my woungest sister, but I dont want to process what I see as a bribe. What should I do?  \nAITA for not wanting to meet them, or follow my dead fathers wishes?

How many topics are left and how much time specifically?\" Start the next topic the same way. Set the boundaries and be clear.

Yeah it's uncomfortable but this is free money if you just play pretend for a few hours, get some help investing it and it could really take the pressure off you in the future or in an emergency.
