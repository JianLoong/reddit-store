He is the result of my dad\u2019s affair with another woman when I was a kid. My dad left my mom and me for his mistress and started a new family with her. He never paid any child support or alimony, and he rarely contacted me. He basically abandoned me and chose his new family over me.  \nMy mom raised me by herself and worked hard to provide for me. She passed away last year from cancer and left me everything she had, which was not much, but enough to pay off my student loans and buy a small apartment. I was devastated by her death and I miss her every day.  \nA few weeks ago, I got a call from my dad\u2019s mistress, who is now his wife. She told me that my dad had died in a traffic accident and that he had left a will. Apparently, he had inherited a lot of money from his parents and had a successful business. He left half of his estate to his wife and the other half to his sons, me and my half-brother. However, he also left a note saying that he wanted me to meet his family to get the money and forgive him saying that he regretted not being a good father to me. He asked his lawyer and wife to contact me and make me aware that he had left me a substantial portion of the inheritance.  \nI was shocked and angry when I heard this. I hate him trying to buy my forgiveness with his money, after ignoring me for most of my life. I told his wife that I didn\u2019t want anything from him and that I wanted nothing to do with them. She sounded hurt and said that they were just trying to honor his wishes and that they wanted to get to know me and be a family. She said that my half-brother was looking forward to meeting me and that he was willing to share \"his\" inheritance with me. She asked me to reconsider and give them a chance.  \nI hung up on her and blocked her number. I don\u2019t want to have any contact with them. I don\u2019t care about the money or the family. I only care about my mom, who was the only parent I ever had. She was the one who loved me and supported me, and she was the one who deserved the inheritance, not them. I dont want them to have it either though, it seems as if I am promised around 25% and I would rather have the money go to my woungest sister, but I dont want to process what I see as a bribe.

Not saying this to dismiss you, your thoughts and your emotions, they're all valid and, tbh, I would also consider spitting on my dad's grave if he's the indirect cause of your mom's death.\n\nHowever, let's explore this...\n\nFirst: why should you gift the Affair lady 800k when she already had and inherited enough? Same with your half brother. Your sister has no mom now and you can choose to give 800k to her or leave them to him. Does it seem fair only because you hate the source of these money?\n\nSecond, your mom would probably be proud of you for being so principled. It's a good thing.

Affair woman said something very bad. Your brother is not \"willing to share HIS inheritance.\" It's not HIS, and her speaking like this is a huge red flag. Ask the legal subreddit about what lawyer would you need for this specific topic (a will, in another state, with attachments like spending bonding time). You may probably be requested to share which country are you from, and it'll be in your best interest to share.\nNext, contact the kind of lawyer they suggest you. He'll contact Affair lady's lawyer, request a copy of the will, and study if it's possible or not (there's a high possibility for it to be possible) to skip the whole bonding part. In many countries you cannot make requests like these, hence you would get the money and full stop.\nAlso, ask 1) if, accordingly to your country's law, you would end up having the money in any case (because this way the Affair would stop guilt tripping you) and 2) if you can file for Child Support (same reason, it's just to have something to reply to her in case she'll try to guilt trip you).\n\nIn case you'll really have to do the bonding, I think there would be some acting to do. Don't show yourself hostile and don't reveal anything about yourself. Also, if possible, ask a relative to join you, you can't face an adult by yourself when there's so much emotions and money involved.

If you are required to spend X hours discussing some things with them (and nothing more), you could consider doing that. It's like when my parents agreed to listen to a time share spiel. They knew they weren't going to buy into it, but they listened and responded politely (but firmly disinterested); and in return our family of 5, plus two other friend families got to spend a really cool weekend at this resort they were promoting. I suggest considering this ONLY if you don't have any emotional distress over this.

Secondly, there are laws stating that you are entitled to a minimum inheritance.

If legal advice comes back in your favour, you can bluff and tell them that you have recieved advice saying it won't stand up in court. You are not going to be traumatised by your AH father further. They can cut the nonsense and pay you your share. Otherwise you will contest the estate and the entire inheritance can be eaten up in legal fees. If they are smart, they may agree. Inheritances don't bring out the smart in people though. The reality is unless your share is hundreds of thousands, legal fees will chew through most of it. Plus the estate will be paying their legal costs but not yours unless a decision is made in your favour. It may be worth sitting through 10 hours with them and grey rocking them or making them as uncomfortable as possible ie mentioning cheating, abandonment as an opener to every sentence eg after my family was torn apart by cheating, I realised my favourite colour was blue. I would ask the lawyer about their opinion on this option too.", "NTA and keep in mind it\u2019s your grandparents money so consider it a gift from them.", "Take the bribe. \n\nLeave the negative feelings behind. The arsehole is dead and buried after all.\n\nYour half-brother and his mother has never done anything towards you. They might even be nice people. Not that you should have anything to do with them, but it couldn\u2019t hurt to meet them.", "Well, go meet these people. Be polite out of respect for yourself. Put your anger aside. The person who caused that anger is dead. Leave them with nothing bad to say about your manners. If you like the time you spend with them, well great. If not, you have no further responsibilities after you get the money.\n\nNTA, but not so classy or smart either.", "It sounds like it would be a lot cheaper just to cooperate. Suing the family who just wants to meet him before giving him the money seems like an AH move. Seems like that could backfire.", "Except all he needs to do is go meet them and spend some time with them to avoid lawyers fees.", "Idk hon maybe look at it as a job that you have to get paid for.  Putting in your hours.  If it's something crazy like 5 years then no but if it's something you can crank out in a few months maybe it's worth it.  \n\nYou could help your sis and have security for yourself.  \n\nJust think about it is all.", "Your mum would be delighted that you\u2019re finally getting what you\u2019re owed, I bet. Don\u2019t let his guilt shaft you over! Spending the bonding time reminiscing about how awesome she was despite his cruel actions etc", "I'm a bit confused. Did neither parent leave any money for your sister?", "Split the 30 hours over 2-3 months and bail. Almost a million $$$ is no joke and could set you up for life.", "Do the time, take the money, and begin therapy young man. $800k is life altering for most anybody and it can be yours and your sisters.", "Thirty hours?  Son, that's less than my work week.  Spend a few days knocking it out with a neutral expression and curt words.  Then tip your hat, get the check, and make like Casper.\n\nBecause for 800 grand, I would suck off Satan himself and swallow afterwards.", "Are there any national or local laws that might govern inheritance rules? I know in the US - biological children could sue to gain a portion of the estate if the will is deemed to be illegal.\n\nEdit to add: if the answer is no and you have no choice - I would ABSOLUTELY  do it.  And then I'd find ways to be maliciously compliant. \n\nYou may have to work on how to handle yourself during the sessions,  but do things like speaking with little  inflection or emotion - as of you're reciting something but just a tad bored.  Let a little sigh every once in a while as you answer a question, then smile nicely at them while you're answering as if you're making sure a slightly dull student understands.  Every once in a while,  kinda look slightly down towards their nose for a second or two while they're talking then then wipe your own and quickly look away.  Yawn and-and scratch a pit once or twice,  then apologize nicely for \"forgetting your manners\".  Ask them to repeat themselves once or twice a session.  And then every once in a while,  pick something they want to talk about and really pretend to be stupid about it but super interested in their opinion. Just waste time and distract them because fuck them and why not.  \n\ndon't want to cross the line and not get the payoff.  Just know that once you do,  you'll never see them again and fuck your dad - once the money's yours,  you can kiss his memory goodbye.", "Treat it like a job.\n\nBelieve me, I've spent a hell of a lot more than 30 hours with people that I don't like, doing stuff I don't like for a hell of a lot less money. \n\nFigure out how much you'd be \"paid\" for each hour. That might help you get through it.", "Get your OWN layer before anything. Chances are they  may find faults and say bonding is not enough etc to deny you. So, you need a laywer to respresent you and treat this as a job/ work.", "Contact an attorney, These requirements may not actually be enforceable.", "Yea, not having that money would suck every time a bill comes due, every extra year you have to work before retiring.", "Disagree on the half-sibling. He's only 16 and still very clearly under the mistress's parentage. He's an innocent party in this and it's possible OP may want a relationship with him in the future. It wouldn't hurt to meet him and see if he wants to continue a relationship. As for the mistress, OP is right in not wanting anything to do with her.", "I agree\u2026this story has quite a few holes in it. Doesn\u2019t add up, the ages, student loans, the sister, his mom passing due to dads leaving.", "ETA: NTA", "Your father was an AH for having the affair, breaking up your family, and then refusing to financially support you. His final act was being an AH by putting stipulations on your inheritance forcing you to spend time with his mistress. \n\nThere was no surer way to make you resent your half brother, than to force you to see him against your will, when you\u2019re not ready, or forgo your inheritance. \n\nConsult a lawyer. Do what you need to get the inheritance that you are OWED. Also, ask that lawyer about suing the estate for back child support.", "Figure out how much money you\u2019d get, divide it by the 10-15 hours and I\u2019d the hourly rate is good enough, do the meetings, take the money and never hear from them again. NTA, but your dad sure was.", "You lost me there.", "With all the Reddit stories I read about still inheritance, your half-brother and stepmom sounds like scent people. It\u2019s not a bad idea talking to them with a lawyer present.", "I would just swallow my pride and go along with it for the money. You might be financially comfortable enough to turn away the cash now, but come to bitterly regret it later when you or someone you care about may be in need.  \n\nYou are more than entitled to feel angry at your dad, but turning away the money is just harming yourself.", "Get a good lawyer and see if your mom had a claim on his estate. Take a support person, tough it out and get the cash. Then you can use it how you like. Don\u2019t gift it to your half brother.", "You suck it up for 15 hours and get the money. If you don\u2019t want it now stick in an investment account with some easy ETF and wait 10-15 years. If you still don\u2019t want it then donate it.", "How much money is he offering? I'd serve the 15 hour minimum, take the money and bail.", "If you'd really like to stick it to them, be pleasant. Do the time, get the payment, give it to your sister and then cut contact.", "Personally I\u2019d speak to the lawyer and then do the bare minimum to get the money \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I would do what other commenters have said about suing for child support. If your 25% is substantial, I would say fuck it and spend the 10-15 hours with them. If that\u2019s it just think of it as two shitty work days to get paid x amount of dollars. Worse case it\u2019s a shitty two days, but you are able to then have money for savings/ future home down payment and can allocate a portion as well for the same portion of for student loans for your younger sister", "800,000 for 30 hrs is 26,666 an hour. You\u2019re right. You\u2019re never going to make that pay rate again.\n\nCan you manage it with your fingers crossed behind your back? Would your mother appreciate your sacrifice so your sister is helped?\n\nOnce it\u2019s done, it\u2019s over and you owe them nothing after that. Rather than seeing it as betraying your mother, think of it as getting what\u2019s rightfully yours and your mom\u2019s from that man and his mistress.", "What should you do?\n\nBased on your story it seems like a lot of money potentially.\n\nWhat you should do is put your emotions aside, if the will is saying spend 15h with these people, you put a smile on, and you do it and receive your payout.\n\nI think you need to change your thinking. This man cheated on your mother, who it seems you had a great relationship with. Your option here is to let this cheating family have your 25% or you can stick it to them and do what the will asks and keep the 25% and move on. \n\nIt has nothing to do with your half brother being \"willing\" to share his inheritance with you. In the will it is yours. Presumably, he will get it if you reject claiming it with the conditions. \n\nIf you want your sister to get it, then you need to collect it, follow the wills wishes, and get the money. \n\nHonestly, put your emotions aside, this is a big amount of money, get it. If it is going to cost you 15 hours and a couple fake smiles, so what? Then you have the money and this cheating family doesn't. I am sorry to hear about your mother in all this, I have to believe she'd want you to have this money and be better off compared to not having it.", "If it\u2019s a lot of money, I\u2019d consider enduring the legally minimum conversation to obtain your share, unpleasant as it may be to spend time with your father\u2019s affair partner.", "Do it all, play nice, get the money, then tell them to fuck off and laugh all the way to the bank. Spend it all on creating a charity in honour of your mum.", "OP your NTA\u2026 but think of it this way\u2026 the money is from your Grandparents they earned the money. The \u201cdad\u201d is just the banker as the money is passed through him to you. Take the money as it is yours. The grandparents will want you to have it. Your mother if she was alive would want you to have it. Just look at the other people as mutual strangers\u2026 You are not obligated to have them in your life beyond 30 hours! If I were you I would get a burner phone and give them that number. That way you won\u2019t have to worry about them contacting you later.
