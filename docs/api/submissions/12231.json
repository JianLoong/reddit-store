Be clear that you will be talking to your aunt and uncle on the third day so that he doesn\u2019t get any bright ideas about lying about telling them. It\u2019s incredibly selfish to do take advantage of someone the way your brother is and incredibly entitled to think the lie doesn\u2019t matter because they\u2019re wealthy. \n\nDon\u2019t get burnt by his dishonesty just because he\u2019s intent on lighting this bridge on fire.", "Here\u2019s the thing, this lie is not something that can be buried over time. \n\nThere is no question of whether his change of majors will ever be discovered.

He has more chances of holding on to the money if he comes clean than if they find out he is lying to them.", "My best advice to you is to mind your own business. What your brother does in college does not effect you. Your brother is not going to be able to keep up his charade for long anyway, so this situation will likely resolve itself pretty soon. But if you try to resolve it, your brother will blame you for a very long time. Sometimes you just have to let things ride themselves out", "If you feel a huge moral burden, why not tell your parents about your concerns? Without throwing your brother under the bus, tell them to check into his schooling more closely. They can check grades, coursework, etc. & have an honest chat with your bro/family about intensions.  From afar, this could be a bigger issue or more of a Ferris Bueller sibling affair.  Not all is fair in love and war.  You are going to be pleased & successful with your CS degree.

Doesn\u2019t matter how anyone feels about it, that\u2019s their money and they have the right to decide where it goes. \n\nHe\u2019s not immoral for switching majors, he is immoral for not involving his aunt/uncle in the conversation when they are fully paying for his education and then actively planning to lie both through omission and directly, I can\u2019t imagine they won\u2019t ask about classes or how things are going - what\u2019s his plan for those conversations? \n\nIf he didn\u2019t want them to find out, he shouldn\u2019t have put his sister in a position that would force her to chose between loyalty to him and loyalty to the people who have treated her like a daughter and are setting her up for success in life", "Threaten how? By not continuing to shell out thousands of dollars because the kid chose to switch majors to one they didn\u2019t agree too and lied to them? That\u2019s not a threat that is a natural consequence. They are being kind by paying for them and have every right to set their own rules about what they are willing to pay for. STEM degrees are much more likely to be profitable right out of college and will continue to increase in demand, they are making an investment in their niece/nephews futures and he should have discussed this before making any changes. \n\nIf you give someone $100 for groceries for their family and they buy beer and try to hide it from you, you have every right to not give them money again. This is no different", "You are basically condoning lying. Such a human you are", "Your morals are showing. Kids a thief, plain and simple.", "More like OP's brother put her in a very difficult situation by telling her that he switched majors from CS to political science.", "Her brother chose to involve her, did you not read the post properly", "The brother dragged her into this, stop cherry-picking", "Yes it does ??", "I would argue that it became her business the second her brother looped her into his lie.", "The people that are paying for her college are being openly lied to for money. It's kind of the business of any decent person", "You\u2019re the brother.", "Then bro can get a loan or figure it out like everyone else. Your personal views on certain subjects have nothing to do with the issue.", "Sorry but there are tons of immoral ways to spend your money.  If you spend it hunting endangered rhinos, you are a giga AH.  If you spend it on someone's college education as long as they aren't gay/trans/dating outside their race/one of the females of the family, then congrats on finding a way to make yourself an even bigger AH while funding someone's education.  If you're not bigoted but attach a lot of other strings around things like a specific major, then you are being a teeny bit of an AH.  Possibly with only a lower case a, but an ah nonetheless", "Bad analogy. If I give $100 to someone for groceries and a specific list for them to buy, but they strongly prefer something even better for them, I don\u2019t give AF. And if I am getting my $100 and choose to buy what I don\u2019t really like, I keep my mouth shut about the other person\u2019s groceries. Not my business.", "This is the correct view of the situation. Had he not involved OP in his lie, none of this would be happening.", "You\u2019re the snitch. I\u2019m comfortable where I am.", "Everyone who has the means to help their children graduate without debt without impoverishing themselves is morally obligated to do so.  This aunt and uncle have chosen to do that for their niblings which is great, but they get judged by the standards of any other relative who has agreed to pay for higher education.  And this may be too much for you but my personal views on the morality of this issue effect my moral judgement on this issue", "I guess we will just have to agree to disagree. They said they would pay for a STEM degree, not a college education. That\u2019s a specific offer and there is nothing wrong with that. Of course there are immoral ways to spend money and if they were denying payment due to discrimination that would be messed up but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. \n\nAlso, I may have misinterpreted one part of this but I would say drawing a hard line at incest would actually be pretty fair lol (dating one of the females of the family)", "YWBTA.  Not your business.  Stay out of it.", "NTA. He made it your business by telling you. If it comes back you knew they could direct their anger towards you also. I don't know that I'd go out of my way to say something but wouldn't lie if questioned.", "NTA. If they find out you know and didn't say then you could lose your funding too. He's the one who decided to lie to get his uni paid for, he needs to deal with the consequences. And I mean, the secret is going to come out at some point, there is no way to keep it forever. Even if it's after you graduate OP, it could damage the relationship if they discover you lied for him. And make no mistake, when someone gets caught in this sort of lie with these sort of repercussions, they tend to bring everyone involved down with them.\n\nWhat gets me is that you can apply to law school with a STEM degree, he didn't need to change his major outside of your aunt and uncle's conditions. If he was smart instead of scummy he would do some sort of STEM major with a poli sci (or similar) minor. STEM covers a lot of things, he doesn't have to do CS, there might be something else that he may find easier or more suited to him. That way funding for his undergrad degree isn't in jeopardy but he can still go into a career that he's interested in.", "NTA. Point out to your brother that defrauding your aunt and uncle by taking their money under false pretenses is not a promising start to a legal career.", "DON'T RAT HIM OUT! Nothing good will come of it. Have you thought this through at all? Your brother will never speak to you again! He discovered that he couldn't cut it in CS, and very reasonably decided to change majors. What he decides to tell his aunt and uncle is his affair.", "[deleted]", "I would say NTA, especially because OP gave brother the choice of confessing himself. If they went to aunt and uncle directly I would have changed my judgement. \n\nIn this situation, it wouldn't sit with me well either. I could never take advantage of family or see family being taken advantage of, as well, I think there is a good chance they will continue paying for him regardless. They seem generous, but who knows ...", "Tell him to get a stem degree and be a patent attorney. Haha. For real though, poli sci is much better as a minor. Also\u2014NTA", "Even if he can keep it quiet, what happens in three years when he graduates? I\u2019d give him an ultimatum - work out a way to tell the aunt and uncle before the start of his sophomore year or you will tell him. He can start dropping hints about how he finds the GE courses more interesting and how law looks interesting. \n\nBut the requirement to study a STEM subject makes no sense. Not everyone is interested in that. \n\nNTA. Give him a chance to do the right thing but don\u2019t let the deception go on much longer.", "NTA but I would have another talk with him and give him one more chance to come clean on his own. Make sure he understands that he would be hurting his relationship with your family AND his reputation. \n\nIt\u2019s a shame your aunt and uncle only see the value in STEM degrees but it\u2019s their money to do with what they want, and it is dishonest of him to try to trick them into continuing to spend money on something they didn\u2019t agree to.", "ESH. Its assholes all the way down.", "NTA       \nThere are so many freaking options with STEM.      \nHe couldn't hack it, reneged the deal, and drags you into the middle of it on the plane ride home?!          \nNot to mention all the effort you put into tutoring him that first year?!       \nPardon my language but your brother is the taint of all taints.", "I\u2019d be torn about it of course,but in the end he\u2019s doing them wrong. NTA. Give him one more chance and tell them.", "NTA but I get that you don't want to ruin your brother's prospects and you don't want to lie to your aunt and uncle so ...fob it off on the parent that is related to your aunt and uncle. Tell that parent and abide by their decision.", "Perfect morals for an attorney lol\n\nYou should tell your aunt and uncle, shit, make it yoir entire argument on why law school would be perfect for him.\n\nNTA and I'm glad I left the legal field.", "NTA....... NTA ...... NTA", "NTA. Your brother has no respect for them. Them having a lot of money is irrelevant. He\u2019s betraying their trust and roping you into the lie as well. TELL THEM", "NTA.  Once he told you he involved you in the lie.  You do not have to lie for anyone and it sounds like you're the type of person who would not want to lie about even the little things.", "NTA Your aunt and uncle are providing a scholarship under certain conditions. For any other scholarship, if your conditions aren't let then you no longer qualify. He had plenty of other STEM majors to choose from. I would encourage him to apply for polysci scholarships.", " NTA", "Do it.", "NTA\n\nSince he told you, I\u2019m leaning towards telling the aunt and uncle if only to avoid fallout when they find out anyway - something tells me he won\u2019t hesitate to try and drag you down with him. If you had somehow found this info out without him telling you, I wouldn\u2019t tell them. \n\nOr you can just send a copy of your current transcript/grades to them and say something like \u201chope you\u2019re proud.\u201d That might get them to ask your brother about his.", "NTA", "NTA \nIf your brother applied for a grant or scholarship program and then didn't follow through on the terms of the funding,  i.e., sports or other grant, then they would lose future funding. \n\nThis sponsorship funding is for STEM.  \n\nHe absolutely doesn't have to complete STEM and should follow his bliss, fund it himself, or apply for financial support from an alternative agency \ud83d\ude09", "According to OP he asked her to nothing of the sort. The question is whether silence is appropriate or not.", "Yes!! The brothers behavior is not sitting right. He knows he is doing something sneaky. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with a Political Science and law. In fact, I don't think the aunt and uncle are so rigid in their rules . If the brother says that I tried my best but this not for me, they will understand.  Instead, he is lying to everyone, including himself.  \n\nHe might not know yet, but you need integrity to become a good lawyer.", "If my brother tried to pull this stunt I would chuck him under the proverbial bus so dang fast his head would spin. College is freaking spendy, I wouldn\u2019t take the risk of potentially losing my paid tuition because he didn\u2019t want to state his case and deal with the consequences. Which ironically would be good practice for the law degree he wants.", "Ew by the sounds of it auntie and uncle are the reason they're going. They made the choice to pick something they're willing to pay for nobody forced them.", "I agree to 1 and 2. Number three is totally their choice.", "If aunt/uncle find out OP knew and she didn't say anything, she risks losing her own education. It's a lose/lose situation, but it comes down to risking an upset brother vs. her future.", "Hm, actually nevermind. ESH because literally all of this could have been avoided if brother could keep a secret to himself. I dont think the law degree is gonna work out because you have to be a good liar for that type of career", "Not an arbitrary rule. They said they would pay if niece and nephew studied something in STEM. Maybe they are wanting to support STEM students and they started with family. Their \"scholarships,\" their rules.\n\nAlso, brother has an awfully cavalier attitude towards other people's money. What he is doing is stealing from aunt and uncle.", "It\u2019s their choice, yes, but some (many?) choices make you an AH. This is one of them. Conditional offers like that are scummy coming from family. Like he\u2019s not good enough for them if he wants to study something other than STEM.", "Nobody is forcing anything", "In this situation, telling us the right thing to do", "How long do you think that either one of them will be able to maintain this? The aunt and uncle both sound like smart people, they're going to get suspicious eventually about the vague and evasive answers they'll necessarily be getting about how school's going from the brother. First port of call for digging for answers is going to be OP, especially since they know that OP had to help him a lot for a while there. It's not going to be as simple as just never saying anything.", "Do what I say or I ma not helping your. That is forcing someone to do what you want.", "You might be right.  The brother\u2019s attitude sucks and he sounds quite entitled.  That said the truth will come out but he should be the one telling aunt and uncle.", "Simple response: talk to my brother. How simple is it going to be for the aunt and uncle to burn all bridges with their only niece and nephew over an arbitrary demand?", "Not really. They can apply for aide, get a loan, pay themselves, not go...there are multiple options.", "You're right, that would have been a bad analogy and that isn't what I said. I said, I give you money to buy food for your family and you buy alcohol instead, I no longer am going to want to give you money for \"groceries\". My intent was to provide your family with food, the Aunt/Uncles intent is to provide a STEM degree. That isn't even a strict guideline, anything in Science Technology Engineering or Math would fall under that umbrella.", "\"We already did, and he's giving us the run around. That's why we're asking you.\" Point is, they're *not* going to be able to maintain just not talking about it forever, they're eventually either going to have to lie, or they're going to have to come clean.", "Damn right I am. If it\u2019s my butt or someone else\u2019s I am looking out for me. It\u2019s called moral compass. Good day.", "Not necessarily true. Maybe that\u2019s your moral code, but it\u2019s not a lot of people\u2019s.", "So his sister gets to graduate with no debt. That is not fair. There parents should have cut the aunt for this.", "Selling out your brother because an aunt and uncle demand he pursue something that is not his dream is not a moral compass.
