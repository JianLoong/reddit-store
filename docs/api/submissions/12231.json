Be clear that you will be talking to your aunt and uncle on the third day so that he doesn\u2019t get any bright ideas about lying about telling them. It\u2019s incredibly selfish to do take advantage of someone the way your brother is and incredibly entitled to think the lie doesn\u2019t matter because they\u2019re wealthy. \n\nDon\u2019t get burnt by his dishonesty just because he\u2019s intent on lighting this bridge on fire.", "Here\u2019s the thing, this lie is not something that can be buried over time. \n\nThere is no question of whether his change of majors will ever be discovered. It\u2019s a matter of WHEN. \n\nEither they\u2019ll find out after he\u2019s graduated with his poly sci degree, or he\u2019ll be discovered before he finishes.\n\nSay he does manage to hide his change of majors and gets a degree in poly sci.

He has more chances of holding on to the money if he comes clean than if they find out he is lying to them.", "My best advice to you is to mind your own business. What your brother does in college does not effect you. Your brother is not going to be able to keep up his charade for long anyway, so this situation will likely resolve itself pretty soon. But if you try to resolve it, your brother will blame you for a very long time. Sometimes you just have to let things ride themselves out", "If you feel a huge moral burden, why not tell your parents about your concerns? Without throwing your brother under the bus, tell them to check into his schooling more closely. They can check grades, coursework, etc. & have an honest chat with your bro/family about intensions.  From afar, this could be a bigger issue or more of a Ferris Bueller sibling affair.  Not all is fair in love and war.  You are going to be pleased & successful with your CS degree.

Arizona State's recent graduating class only awarded Humanities degrees (ALL the arts and soft science COMBINED) to 11% of its total grads. \n\nAll I'm saying is the STEM at all cost rhetoric has gone too far and every now and then you need a philosophy major to tell an engineer that even though they CAN, that they shouldn't be looking for ways to optimize genocide, to use an extreme hypothetical.", "NTA, Be careful.  If you say nothing and they find out you could be risking your own college fund.  Imagine the roles were reversed.  It was your money and your requirements and your brother lied to you.  How would that make you feel.\n\nMaybe you need to sit down with your brother and parents and talk it out.", "Honestly he should bring it to his parents. It\u2019s not his job to rat the sibling out, but maybe his parents can help them make a case for the switch to poly sci. STEM is not for everyone and it\u2019s not like the sibling is taking the easy way out with law school", "NTA the second he told you - thats it - you have a duty to tell your aunt and uncle.\n\nIts his fault for telling you. Its on him. You should not lie and be part of defrauding them.\n\nTell him he has 24 hours to tell them or you will. Its better it comes from him and the longer you know the more you look bad and in on it.\n\nTime is important or you will jeopardise your relationship with them.", "NTA \n\nKeeping a secret which only effects the parties keeping it is one thing, when it impacts others then it's not ok.\n\"It's ok to defraud them because they can afford it\" is the short of thing I can get behind when we are talking about Billionaires, not some folks who actually work for a living.", "This is a tough one for me. TBH my gut says it would be a bit of a jerk move to go out of your way to rat him out but if your aunt and uncle ever find out that you knew and didn't tell them, that could potentially land *you* in hot water. For that reason, if nothing else, I'm going NTA.", "REally difficult situation bc if they find out you knew and didn't trust them enough to tell them.. .but also your brother for lying and asking you to do the same...\n\nWould you be able to have a conversation with your aunt/uncle about why they are adament it must be STEM?  Law school is a pretty good field as well?\n\nFor the \"who cares they have so much money anyways\" I would say tell them,  NTA", "Technically you would be N T A because he agreed to their rules. However, don't forget that being right doesn't mean you will not face consequences of your actions. If you rat him out, your relationship with your brother will change. It is up to you if you are fine with it.", "YWNBTA give him a deadline by when he has to tell them himself and argue his case or you'll tell them.\n\nHe has dragged you into this and if they find out you knew, they could stop paying your tuition as well.", "NTA\n\nHe made it your business by telling you. You can't tell others to keep secrets for you they morally disagree with to keep a secret.\n\nHe should have kept his mouth shut if he wanted to take in that money. (because I do agree that the aunt and uncle are putting unreasonable limitations on the money)", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t get involved in your brothers business\n\nYour brother shouldn\u2019t be dishonest to your Aunt and Uncle.\n\nAnd last but not least: it says a lot about someone if they offer money with these kinds of strings attached. Your aunt and uncle use their money to buy influence in their nephew\u2019s life, knowing very well that neither you nor your brother are in a position to refuse said money. This is a complete AH-move, loving aunts and uncles would never try to force a major on you, especially if it makes you unhappy.", "ESH\nYou because being a tattle tale should end at about age 5. It's not your business to interfere so stay out of it.\n\nYour brother because he's using your aunt and uncle and not being honest with them. But if he had to borrow so much from you it's clear he has no aptitude for CS and could have brought it up with them. \n\nAnd your Aunt and Uncle for forcing you into a field of study that they enjoy rather than funding courses that would suit the individual.", "I'm going to say ESH. Your aunt and your uncle suck for putting stipulations on their gift to pay for college. Not everyone is cut out for a STEM degree and your brother clearly found that out and wants to pursue his dream of going into law. You kind of suck for being a tattle tale but I also think you need to encourage him to come clean. He wasn't going to hack it and he knows and yes taking the money is very wrong (which is why he sucks as well) in regards to paying for his education. He needs to be honest with them that what he enjoys most is studying law and maybe being an impact in the world with this goal in mind.", "YTA. Mind your business.", "Yeah, if OP just happened to find out and then immediately ran of to tell, that would probably be a bit of a jerk move, but OP's brother put them in the middle.", "I went to law school with a chemistry degree because my father insisted on STEM.", "Totally agree. A long conversation is needed with your brother on how this is going to play out in the future if he starts by lying, general ethics of the situation, no no of involving someone else in the lie. Hopefully he can see the light. You could sweeten the deal by offering to help him hone his case before he talks to them.  Good luck!", "The issue with keeping quiet is that if the aunt and uncle find out that OP knew (and brother very well may throw OP under the bus and tell them when he\u2019s discovered, there\u2019s no way to hide this forever) they could stop paying that tuition too. I\u2019m going with NTA, for the sake of their own future and for the fact that their brother basically put them in a no win situation", "Because it'll come out and the aunt and uncle will likely feel betrayed by OP too. The only one who should have kept their mouth shut is the brother. He's put OP at risk by telling them. That's on the brother noone else. Brother is going what's right for him. OP should do what's right for them and tell.", "Inserting herself? The brother made it OP\u2019s business by telling her and then expecting her to keep his secret.", "That's what really tips it into NTA territory for me. OP's in a position where if she doesn't say anything, there's a good chance it will come back on her.\n\nIt would be one thing if her brother was keeping it on the QT and she just never pried too deeply, but that's not what's happening here.", "You're right. When it started I was fine. Then I got to the part of them having oodles of money in their comically large vault and needed to reduce the depth to prevent drownings and that the brother felt entitled based on this. I thought a bit more and wondered why the hell he told his sister?! Did he think she'd just be a-ok, or did he want to make her a party to his deception. That way, if he got caught, she is implicated. Based on this, she has to tell. There is no situation I can think of where she gets out clean if he gets caught. Even if she deflected questions to him, she still knows. She's just refusing to answer, and at some point, they're going to want to know why.\n\nBottom line? She's NTA and has to tell.", "Yes, I think it is awful to place those kinds of restrictions on someone\u2019s education and career. The stipulation that they keep their grades up is fine.  But limiting their support to STEM is really silly and has just resulted in the kind of outcome (nephew lying to them) that you\u2019d expect from restrictions like this. \n\nESH", "They're going to find out at graduation anyway. The brother has not really thought it through.", "I get that but using that to influence what field someone is gonna be in for the rest of their life is shity", "so money gives you the ability to control other people's lives? you should get to decide what somebody does as a job for the rest of their life just because you gave them money? no.", "And if it matters so much they can keep an eye on the classes and grades without the Op. \n\nThis is a classic example of tattling. The Op doesn\u2019t have to go out of their way to tell anyone. If they really really care about being in a STEM major they will be checking grades and talking to him about classes. It will naturally come out when he can\u2019t engage in discussion. The Op needs to keep their mouth out of it and pretend they heard nothing.", "Or FFS at least do it in a way that allows others to maintain plausible deniability. Straight-out admitting it like this puts them on the spot in a way that really forces their hand.", "It kind of does, he is accepting money under false pretences and has made OP an accomplice by telling. If the aunt and uncle find out OP knew  and kept this a secret they may well feel betrayed and cut OP\u2019s tuition.", "We don't know their aunt and uncle, would they pull her funding too if they find out she kept the secret?", "Why would you pay for someone's tuition if they are just gonna waste it with a useless degree?", "At best, that argument would make them in the wrong for a matter not really related to the one under discussion here. \n\nPersonally, I agree that \"I'll help you out but only with extreme strings\" is a bit heavy-handed but that's their prerogative.", "What power imbalance? They aren't forcing him to do anything.", "Which is what happened. I agree with you, an asshole move.", "There are lots of people with money who set up scholarships to help students who are working towards a major that the donors choose. Are they assholes?", ">It is always an asshole move to base paying tuition for someone on the subject they choose.\n\nNo, it isn't. It's their money and they're already being generous by offering it for STEM degrees. \n\n>chance of people choosing something they aren't suited for, thus being miserable and in the end dropping out.\n\nWhich would be the case if they didn't offer any money. Or, you know, the thing they have no obligation to do in the first place.\n\nYou know what's worse? Being so completely dishonest and entitled. And then expecting someone else to maintain such a big lie for you. Pretty sure an ethics and morality module is mandatory for any law degree, so looks like OP's brother has already failed it. \n\nLike OP said, these people seem like rational adults, so there's no reason to assume they couldn't be convinced to fund a law degree.", "yeah .. power imbalance?  Really?  gotta jam that into everything, it seems.  Oh brother.", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

There is nothing stopping him from carving his own path without their generosity. So no, incentivizing someone towards a STEM degree is not the same as 'forcing' someone into doing what they don't want to.\n\n>than to use your immense power over children to push them to live by their will.\n\nHow exactly are they pushing him to live by their will? The only way that would apply is if OP's brother is intent on exploiting their generosity for his own entitlement. But again, no one's forcing him into doing that."]}
