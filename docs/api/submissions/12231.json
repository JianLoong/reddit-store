Be clear that you will be talking to your aunt and uncle on the third day so that he doesn\u2019t get any bright ideas about lying about telling them. It\u2019s incredibly selfish to do take advantage of someone the way your brother is and incredibly entitled to think the lie doesn\u2019t matter because they\u2019re wealthy. \n\nDon\u2019t get burnt by his dishonesty just because he\u2019s intent on lighting this bridge on fire.", "Here\u2019s the thing, this lie is not something that can be buried over time. \n\nThere is no question of whether his change of majors will ever be discovered.

He has more chances of holding on to the money if he comes clean than if they find out he is lying to them.", "My best advice to you is to mind your own business. What your brother does in college does not effect you. Your brother is not going to be able to keep up his charade for long anyway, so this situation will likely resolve itself pretty soon. But if you try to resolve it, your brother will blame you for a very long time. Sometimes you just have to let things ride themselves out", "If you feel a huge moral burden, why not tell your parents about your concerns? Without throwing your brother under the bus, tell them to check into his schooling more closely. They can check grades, coursework, etc. & have an honest chat with your bro/family about intensions.  From afar, this could be a bigger issue or more of a Ferris Bueller sibling affair.  Not all is fair in love and war.  You are going to be pleased & successful with your CS degree.

If they ask you something just be honest. If while being honest it gets him in trouble or caught then that\u2019s on him.", "NTA. And brother is an excellent lawyer in the making. Already scamming to people for money. He will do great in corporate. For Purdue for example", "ESH. Aunt and Uncle suck for choosing your careers, your brother sucks for being a liar and a cheater, without the guts to admit that CS isn't for him, but law is, and you suck for inserting yourself into this situation.", "Nta, but I advice you to not say anything until the aunt and uncle ask. That way you\u2019re not lying and you\u2019re also not snitching. Be Switzerland in that situation.", "How much loyalty do you owe your brother, OP ?\n\nIf you are loyalty to your brother, keep his secret.\n\nIf you are loyal to yourself,  tell your Aunty and uncle.\n\nIn the end  secrets have av tendency to seep out.  IMO, tell aunt first.  She may or may not tell her husband.  What she does is entirely her business.  \n\nNTA", "Absolutely YWBTA. Are you really going to fuck over your own brother like this? He will never tell you anything personal for a long long time if you so this. Requiring a STEM degree is stupid, it isn\u2019t for everyone and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s switching to art, it\u2019s political science, he wants to be a lawyer. Stay out of it.", "You\u2019re in a tough position. I despise rats. However, if your aunt and uncle found out that you knew about this and didn\u2019t tell them, I think you\u2019d be in the same boat as he is. \n\nI\u2019ll say one other thing\u2014your brother is a fool for switching to political science. It\u2019s a useless degree. It doesn\u2019t matter at all what your undergraduate degree is. He\u2019s far better off getting something useful in case law school doesn\u2019t pan out, which is very common.", "ESH", "Torn on this one, but essentially NTA\n\nYour brother is committing fraud basically.  You've also given him the chance to confess.\n\nHowever, by telling them, you could change the trajectory of your brothers life and very likely end the relationship with him and your aunt/uncle.\n\nYour brother is TA here, and you are in a shit position, you would not be TA if you ratted him out, but you'll need to accept the consequences of doing that", "I hate this situation, he put you in a really hard place by telling you the truth. I'd offer support in changing you uncle and aunt's mind, they seem like they could be persuaded into paying for law school. I would avoid lying directly though, I'd go with lie by omission, pretend I didn't know, all that jazz. You wouldn't be the asshole,  but you'd be kinda mean.", "NTA\n\nYou have to tell them to make sure they don't lash out at you and stop paying for your schooling too.", "NTA. Your brother should not expect you to lie for him, nor should you. Your aunt and uncle have been very generous regardless of how much money they have. Respecting their wishes and honesty are a bare minimum.", "INFO: I'll start by saying I'm not mad keen on the 'we'll lavish money on you if you want to be like us, but if you're not naturally gifted at or interested in STEM you're not worth it' vibe of the offer, but their money, their choice. I'm also not mad keen on your brother lying or putting you in this situation. I don't think this is a case of WYBTA so much as 'damage limitation for the whole family'. How do your parents tend to react to this kind of thing? If he gets the funding pulled because you told, are they going to tell him he let them down and messed up, or are they going to fall out with aunt and uncle and blame you as well? Are you sure they don't know already? If they found out would they even definitely tell aunt and uncle? Is there maybe a wise and neutral third party, the grandparent your parent and the aunt/uncle share maybe, that you could go to and say \"I have been put in a difficult situation, I want to do the right thing, but I don't know what that is, can you help me stop this turning into a family rift?\" If not I think you go to your parents and say the same thing, not direct to your aunt and uncle without your parents knowing. If it turns out they already know, default to 'I won't lie if directly asked, and if they ask how he's getting on I'll say I don't know because he doesn't talk about it'.", "NTA", "What's your damage here, OP?\n\nYTA", "I'll say ESH. \n\n- Your aunt and uncle for putting a stupid condition on their offer to pay for college. It's their money and they're not obliged to pay for your college, but in my opinion when you offer to pay for a relative's studies you should be doing so because you care about their future and their education, not because you wish to dictate what path in life they're going to take. The fact that they're willing to discriminate between siblings based on what degree they're pursuing doesn't make them sound like very nice people. \n\n- Your brother, because even though I disapprove of your Aunt's and Uncle's conditions, they were made very clear in advance, and he cannot get their money through lies and subterfuge. \n\n- And I think YWBTA if you ratted him out (at least at this stage) because while he's doing something wrong, it's up to him to fix this situation. I'd insist he comes clean on his own, and maybe offer to have a talk with your aunt and uncle about paying for his college. \nYour brother's attitude is understandable when stinking rich family would support you and not him for no valid reason. Understanding this might be the key to getting into his head and convince him to spill the beans on his own.", "Speaking as a philosophy major here, so. Lol.\n\nAs far as your brother's comment about lying to your aunt/uncle being morally right/wrong, it is. Consider this, however - your aunt and uncle, by *\"giving\"* you their money under such stringent conditions, may be considering you and your brothers' educations as investments, perhaps in social prestige or for later relevance when their own education becomes outdated, or for material support once they are in retirement. Your description of your family background suggests that your family members really only have the sciences as a reference point for \"legitimate\" jobs, and the implication is that your degrees are meant to secure the two of you employment *in the field of computer science*. It sounds like your brother has been struggling with the topic and maybe became aware that he was asking for too much help from you in previous courses. I really hope you and your brother have talked about your frustrations about letting him cheat off your notes and you're not letting this resentment affect your decision-making and are at least trying to help your brother come up with some reasons to break the news or try to sway your aunt and uncle about what is very extensive (but once again, pretty strict) support with all of that in mind.\n\nDon't....BTA?", "Also, the OP clearly gave the brother the option to step up and be honest.  He said no.  This is a teachable moment in responsibility and honesty.", "I'm having a hard time saying N T A because many non-STEM degrees can be very valuable too, and forcing them to narrow their career prospects just to have help paying for college seems absolutely ridiculous. He shouldn't have to make a case for law school.", "Um it's their money, they can do what they want with it", "Brother also could switch to any of the other majors that fall under STEM, then in law school he can specialize in STEM issues (e.g. intellectual property law, etc).", "If brother can\u2019t make it in computer science, there are still tons of majors included in the world of STEM.", "so does scholarship, scholarship had terms. if you view scholarship as one of the thousand reasons to help in school, the aunt and uncle's words are practically the same.", "Hm it affects her bc she doesn\u2019t only care about herself. She cares about other people as you should", "Except auntie and uncle will probably revoke the sisters tuition payments if they find out she was also being dishonest", "Except auntie and uncle will probably revoke the sisters tuition payments if they find out she was also being dishonest", "Then he should of not made it her business by saying anything", "Except auntie and uncle will probably revoke the sisters tuition payments if they find out she was also being dishonest", "Except auntie and uncle will probably revoke the sisters tuition payments if they find out she was also being dishonest", "It's \"alternative facts\" \ud83d\ude06", "Or politics, right?", "This sub isn't \"Am I in the right?\". Sometimes doing something you have the right to do is being an AH.", "The OP could lose her funding if her aunt and uncle found out she knew and said nothing. \n\nSo this issue does affect her.  It has nothing to do with sabotaging their sibling.", "So is not asking your sister to lie to family for you.", "Are you a child with no understanding of the power imbalance here and how that affects the morals of the situation?", "Loyalty is its own reward my friend.", "Aunt and Uncle have no obligation, whether it be moral or legal, to pay for their tuition. It was conditional from the day they offered it. \n\nThe agreement was they study STEM, and college would be paid for. Brother decides to switch, all for him, but he shouldn\u2019t expect them to continue paying. It\u2019s truly as simple as that.", "No. I'm someone who lives in reality and knows that kindness outside families often comes with conditions. But you are welcome to cash in your moral points at your neighborhood banking institutions.", "Speak on it. I don't know why you are down voted to hell for speaking the cold truth. You don't like their condition? Don't take their money and figure it out like the rest of us. Bunch of entitled kids here.", "To really work in finance, you need working knowledge of financial/accounting principles and same with law which I argue that English degree might come in more handy since you can explore the copywriting route.

So no, poli science probably wouldn't help there either.\n\nEdit: spelling", "But this is kindness within a family?", "Nonsense. My bff worked in Private Equity after Strategic Consulting (with b-school in between). My old roommate started as an accountant at Earnest and Young. I was offered two consulting jobs while I was still in school. \n\nI never said the people I know at Salesforce worked on the tech side. Someone has to actually get people to use it, strategize on what should be implemented next, translate engineer to business, and generally do all the businessy things. \n\nContrary to popular belief, you don\u2019t have to have the degree on the job posting. Top firms want people with great grades and recommendations from professors that say you\u2019ve got grit and brains. Nobody who works in finance cares if you have a business degree. With few exceptions, they don\u2019t expect you to know anything. They want kids who are hard working and willing to learn. They\u2019re going to teach you their way anyway. \n\nThe only way it\u2019s limiting is if he limits it. The answer is always no if you don\u2019t ask.", "Immediate? No. Are they her parents? No. Do they have financial obligations of 200k ( two students in college) to kids that is not their own? No. They did this as a nice gesture with conditions like taking out a student loan and promised to payback after graduation. The only difference is they are not asking to repayment but to follow their will. If you don't consent to that condition then what right do you have to THEIR MONEY? You go ahead and explain in your non childish terms why they are OWED that money without any condition? I'll wait.", "I have been in fortune 50 almost all my career. I never got an interview out of college cause of the professor's word. I got it through testing on my knowledge of the field that I'm interviewing for and never have been asked to provide an GPA ( only exception was for  Musk\"s company, they are the only company that has ever asked for an GPA cause nobody cares as your resume already passed the first screening). You don't have to have the exact match but they do look to see how your major ties out to the job at hand. I have seen a bunch of engineers in the supply chain field and math majors in marketing. At the end of the day, it's all about how you work with numbers but you need a relatable field to get your foot in the door.", "You don't have a right to their money, but it does make you an arsehole to attach conditions that display your biases when you offer money.\n\nLet's say we are going out for lunch, I offer to pay for your share but only if you dance like a monkey for me until I am satisfied.
