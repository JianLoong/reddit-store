Yes, and kinda YTA (Thou I get and understand why it was said), that type of truth can be very hard to hear and should be said privately. As for not paying for her meal, you're sisters.

Anyone who goes to technical school/college chooses their major, and no one has to/needs to have kids these days.

Now, do I think you were at all correct that it's *her* fault she's poor? God no. You're way off base with that and that take honestly just seems to come from a place of wealth privilege. It is not *her* fault she's poor. It is not *her* fault that teachers are severely underpaid. It is not *her* fault that, as you said, you get to be paid probably double what I assume your sister is making for the same amount of college yet way less work. It is not *her* fault that our economy is so fucked that a large amount of people can barely afford basic necessities. You also conveniently made no mention of the father or his income so I'm guessing she's a single mother. Is it *her* fault for that too if that is in fact the case? I'm also not into the weird implied mom-shaming. And would never agree with the concept of you being better than her because she followed her passion and you followed money *especially* when it's teaching, such an under-appreciated, underpaid, and integral job. But again, with constant complaining and snide remarks, I get why you were frustrated.\n\nBut do you also get *why* she's making remarks to you? For all of the aforementioned reasons, it's not easy watching someone easily make 6 figures while you work way harder and make a fraction of that. And again, that's not your fault nor am I saying your sister has the right to take her anger out on you which is why this is ESH, but I do feel you could've come at it with more compassion. It seems this snapping at her was the first time you had truly brought up your frustrations. Couldn't you have just sat her down in private at any point prior to this or after this and just give a \"hey, I get finances are stressing you out and I understand why it sometimes comes out on me but I don't think that's fair to me\". Instead you not only snapped at her in front of the whole family, you not only said some really nasty things in front of everyone, but then you singled her out and made her pay when she attended under the understanding you would pay. This is why I lean towards YTA of this ESH scenario. You didn't *need* to go off on her publicly like that. And even further, it's not only just an asshole move to single her out and make her pay as you continue to pay for everyone else, but you also could've just financially fucked her for a little. \n\nWhen you're strapped for cash, *every* dollar matters. You are budgeting for *everything*. Paying for her own meal at a restaurant when she didn't even get to have a say in where to go was not calculated in her budget. You also didn't mention how nice this restaurant is, but considering you're celebrating *and* you're celebrating getting even *more* money, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this probably wasn't a cheap restaurant. That's money that was probably gonna go to putting food on the table, or clothes on her children's backs, or a roof over their head, and now that money is suddenly gone. You did not just hurt your sister, you hurt her family.", "YTA, you invited everyone out to celebrate. You should have stuck to that plan. \n\n\nYou outburst was not the time or place to unleash on your sister. And it certainly shouldn't have been in front of the kids.

She is creating a reality that she is superior because she works for everything she has and to do that, she must rationalize why you are in a different place. \n\nYou've basically tore your sister down in a public place, in front of her kids. Then left her with a check she wasn't expecting to pay. You didn't solve the problem, you only \"put her in her place.\" \n\nIf you want to get things right with your sister, apologize for the outburst, and really have a conversation with her about the fact that your lives have taken different paths but you do respect the life that she has.

I\u2019ve paid for several extracurricular for my nieces/nephews, I\u2019ve picked up the tab on many occasions for different things.\n\nJust because she is poor doesn\u2019t mean that she has any right to put me down or make me feel like a bad person, all because I don\u2019t experience the same struggle that she does.\u201d", "She literally posted it in the comments and in the post , how am I not supposed to know ? Her sister knows what she\u2019s doing and she\u2019s taking it out on the wrong person , just bc she can\u2019t take it up with the right person doesn\u2019t mean she needs to take it out on others , OP is not in a position of power to settle the wage problem , she knows what she\u2019s doing. That\u2019s like saying I can get mad at someone for stealing my wallet and then go punch a person that was trying to help me get it back and hold it against them even though it\u2019s not their fault . You act ungrateful, you get nothing period, poor or not.", "Op doesn't really talk about any previous attempts to more tactfully tell her sister to stop being a petty asshole. Instead op let's it sit and fester until finally op explodes. Sure, sister is in the wrong here, but it's possibly the first she's heard of it. She hasn't been given an opportunity to realize and correct her assholeish behavior. \n\nIs OP an asshole for getting upset? No, but could Op have handled it better? Definitely.", "I think it's important to note that OP screwed with her sister's *family*, not her sister. Even if it was $20, which let's be real I'm sure it was far more expensive than that, when you haven't budgeted for that, it can really throw you off financially. What OP did was not punish her sister for being a b, she punished her sisters children by adding to the family's financial strain.\n\nI also don't see *any* logic in \"Oh you're clearly *so* stressed out about money that you're taking it out on me, so in return I will blame you for how underpaid teachers are, essentially tell your children they are a mistake and a burden to their faces, *and* to top it all off, I'm gonna actively make your finances even more strained! That's what you get!\" Fuck no. How about a calm conversation where OP expresses she doesn't feel the sister's anger is being rightfully placed on OP's shoulders.", "This cobra guy is weird and needs a tough reality check \ud83d\udc80 if you look at his replies towards OP he\u2019s very spiteful towards a woman he doesn\u2019t even know bc she has $$", "Or maybe sister should be a decent person and not put her insecurities onto her sister and why would OP want to pay for someone who makes fun of her career and acts ungrateful towards her ? It\u2019s not OP job to make sure they\u2019re financially stable which she does the bare minimum of helping out as it is , sister should learn to be grateful , she\u2019s the one that screwed her family over by running her month and being ungrateful , \u201cdon\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you\u201d and look what happened , and now she knows that you don\u2019t talk down on ppl who help you bc they can take it away if they wanted\n\nAnd no where did OP blame her sister for the wage of teachers, you clearly got the 2 mixed up , OP is merely calling out her sister for disrespecting her", "It doesn't. But it also doesn't make it right to do what you did. Ultimately you have to decide: Do you want to be the bigger person or do you want to be the petty person?"]}
