You had me until you singled out your sister's meal at the end and didn't pay for it. You invited everyone to a brunch to celebrate you and intended to pick up the tab. Your sister deserves to be called out but that move was petty and frankly, pretty classless.", "ESH. She is acting like a child by making barbed comments to deal with her jealousy and resentment. You responded like a child by having a temper tantrum at a dinner that you threw to show off your financial success.\n\nAn adult woild have told her \"I really respect what you do, and I know it's a hard job. Plus being a mom on top of all that. But it hurts when you say things that minimize my own hard work. I think we both ought to feel good about our careers, don't you?\"\n\nY'all are just wrapped up in juvenile sibling rivalry here, and there was definitely a better way for you to handle this.", "ESH. Your sister's frustrations are misplaced--she does very important work but is overworked and underpaid, but the way we as a society treat our teachers is at fault, not you. However, you also seem to think poorly of your sister-- \"She has this attitude where she thinks she's this amazing person because she struggles, and then she expects sympathy from everyone around her\" and you think she has poor decisionmaking--which kind of shows in how you lashed out on her and then decided not to pay for her meal despite paying for everyone else's when your originally intended to cover the entire bill.", "Grow up, you said you would pay then you should pay.", "I\u2019m 2 sentences in and this is the most painfully obvious bait I\u2019ve ever seen Jesus", "YTA. You offered to pay for everybody. Stick to that.\n\nAnd instead of bottling up your resentment for years, then losing your cool all at once, try talking to your sister directly about how you feel and how she feels.", "I'm gonna go ESH only because of the way you handled it *verbally*. Had you let her say her piece, and at the end, not paid, I would have said N. T. A.\n\nYou should have taken the high road and not been baited into the war of words.", "Going against the grain and saying ESH on this one. Sister sucks for making numerous insults toward you over a long period of time because she's envious of your success. All you did was give her the same treatment she was giving you with her insults with your \"reasons\" she not successful. Your reasons were a reality check as your sister's life decisions are the reason, Shes not as successful as she wants to be. Your suck for \"snapping\" at your sister while having a celebratory dinner with your parents just wasn't the right time or place for that.", "ESH. Teachers are grossly underpaid and extremely necessary. Those are valid complaints.

Had you told her you aren\u2019t paying before she ordered, you\u2019d be fine. But you waited till you could financially damage her.\n\nShe hurt your feelings.\n\nYou caused her to possibly struggle to pay bills because you tricked her into believing you were paying. \n\nI think you should reimburse your sister. Not to be the bigger person but to be a person of your word. You can go low contact after that.", "YTA because you invited her. If you\u2019re the host and you told everyone you\u2019re paying, it\u2019s incredibly rude to stick someone with a bill at the last minute. Though your sister behaved poorly, you could just let her know that she is no longer invited at the next celebration you throw, paid for the meal and go low contact with her.", "OP is really just replying to people stroking her ego. This is an easy ESH. Sister is childish for lashing out, sister is petty for acting like she did. I'm all for petty responses but lashing out publicly makes you both equally terrible people.", "YTA for saying you would pay for everyone and then not paying for only her. that was an AH move and i think you know that. but you weren't wrong about what you said, anyone who is struggling financially and continues to add children to their family is doing it to themselves, and struggling with the consequences of her own decisions doesn't give her license to belittle you or your job.", "YTA, big time. You invited her to brunch to celebrate how much money you were making, then you made her pay for her meal to punish her for complaining about being poor.", "ESH\n\nThis one conflicts me. As a former teacher, I get the struggle, as a high income earner, I also get your POV.\n\nEither case, throwing it in her face and blowing up at her during a family gathering was not a good approach. Your words weren\u2019t wrong, just tactless.", "NTA\n\nShe should keep her mouth shut.", "NTA - It is a bit petty to not pay for your sister's meal, but if she's been persistently rude I think that can make it valid for you to renege on paying for her.  \nIn life you will have people that consistently make poor decisions and seem intent on blaming the whole world for the undesirable outcomes. It seems like this is your sister in a nutshell (and unfortunately, mine also)", "NTA, but you should have followed through on your obligation to pay for the meal instead of switching it on her. She shouldn't be putting you down but it's she's verbalizing her envy of you and her anger at herself and her life choices...that's what is coming out of her mouth. Hopefully she can talk with someone on how to manage her anger issues.", "YTA for paying for everyone other than her. That was cruel, tbh. You should apologize, and you should have a heart to heart discussion about how her statements hurt you, and you should also listen to how she feels. It\u2019s not your responsibility for your different incomes, but both of you need to air it out, forgive each other and find common ground.", "Esh neither of you have any grace at all.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your sister\u2019s fault that jobs our society depends on, like teachers and service workers, are extremely undervalued and underpaid while many tech and engineering jobs are now being seen as literally \u201cdo nothing\u201d jobs which exist primarily because major companies are interested in hiring workers specifically in order to prevent them from working somewhere else and overpaying them in order to retain them. Your sister is family, she\u2019s struggling, and there\u2019s really no reason whatsoever to rub her face into the fact that the economy is biased and unfair. Yeah it\u2019s your money and you have the right to do what you want with it, but how about practicing a little kindness and compassion?", "YTA", "NTA. She chose the life she lives. You\u2019re under no obligation to tolerate her bs just because she struggles.", "YTA. You offered to pay and then pulled that in the restaurant when you know she isn\u2019t well off. Could have just not invited her", "YTA. We are all SO proud of you for becoming an engineer. And we are also proud of your BRAVE decision not to have kids. Is that what you want to hear? So you came to Reddit to brag with the thinly veiled pretense of your sister\u2019s complaints?\n\nI doubt your sister even did anything wrong, you\u2019re just hearing what you want to hear.", "nta she didn\u2019t have to attend the dinner if it really bothered her this much that you make more than her", "NTA Cut Her Off she's blaming you for her financial problems the majority of the comments will probably say yta but you're not in the wrong here she's constantly angry at you for decision she chose", "NTA - she doesn\u2019t get to dump her bitter jealousy all over you and then expect to enjoy a free meal on your dime.\n\nAs an aside; unless you are so gifted at math/engineering you could do your job in your sleep stop dismissing your accomplishment - is it less physically taxing to sit at a desk vs chase toddler\u2019s all day? Sure. But that doesn\u2019t mean her job is \u2018harder\u2019 than yours or that you are undeserving of your salary/lifestyle.", "NTA - she\u2019s jealous and needs to back off.", "I do think you should've just paid as you originally agreed, but I still say NTA. She's clearly very jealous that she puts in so much work for little reward but that isn't your fault. If someone made snide remarks like that all the time, I'd have a problem with it.", "LOL\n\nNTA\n\nShe made choices\nChoices have consequences \nThose consequences aren't yours\n\nCongrats on the promotion", "NTA, how isnt your job a real job if youre making 140k a year", "Initially, I did think you were in the wrong, but as I read along, I found out that you have done nothing to deserve to be mistreated.  Your sister, while wrong for berating you in public, is entitled to her opinion.  Is her opinion justified?  I don't think so.  Even a work at home engineering job is a real job.  If she, really, wanted to make money on her major, she should have used her major to become a writer.  There are people, like me, who are always looking for.fresh writing talent.", "NTA. Love how your sister though it was a good idea to accept an invitation to celebrate your promotion and then talk crap about you. You probably lashed out a little too much because you held your tongue for so long but really she started it and you ended it.", "NTA. She should\u2019ve kept her mouth shut. She got what she deserved", "NTA. She was being rude and crude to you. You offered to pay for her and her family. She chose to insult you. That's like kicking a gift in the mouth or biting the hand that feeds you. If she despises you just because of your job then, out of her personal feelings, she should feel like she should pay for herself and her family. \nDo I think you saying her decision to keep having kids when she couldn't easily afford it went to far? Yes, and kinda YTA (Thou I get and understand why it was said), that type of truth can be very hard to hear and should be said privately. As for not paying for her meal, you're sisters. That's something that can be forgiven.", "NTA, for being honest", "NTA", "NTA your absolutely right. Why couldn\u2019t she just be happy for you?", "NTA. Jealousy is an ugly look. Why would she constantly insult the person who invited them out to eat and was even pay for it. She deserved that tongue lashing you gave her and she didn't deserve to have her meal paid for by you.", "NTA.  Anyone who goes to technical school/college chooses their major, and no one has to/needs to have kids these days.  She chose her baby daddy(ies) and if she's not still with the dude(s), it's also not your problem that she's not getting child support for 3 kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe a job that doesn't take a lot of study but can be highly profitable like a pet groomer where eventually she'd be able to set her own hours. With 3 kids this might work good for her."]}
