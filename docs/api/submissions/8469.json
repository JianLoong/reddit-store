Your husband humiliated your son's accomplishments first, and yet you only stopped one of them.\n\nYou let your husband treat your son like shit for his good news, and I have a feeling you did this ever since he was ten. You may be a wife to your husband but you are not a mother.", "YTA \u2026 and the jokes on you here. The vast majority of Ph.D. programs, especially in STEM fields, are completely funded. This means that not only will your son not pay tuition, he will also receive a salary to study. When he graduates, the average salary for a Ph.D. in Physics is around $160,000 yearly. I\u2019m so glad you and your husband showed your true colors to your son before you could try to mooch off of his impending success. You really played yourself.", "YTA for not appreciating his accomplishment.\n\nAnd for the record, if he is going into a PhD program in physics, it likely comes with a fellowship and tuition waivers so that he won\u2019t need your help.  I was on my own for my PhD in chemistry, and while it wasn\u2019t living in luxury, I was able to pay rent and feed myself ( no time for hobbies and extra curricululars any way in grad school)\n\nSo he likely doesn\u2019t need your help and your husbands response was mean and in called for.\n\nHope that by taking your husbands side in this that you are comfortable missing your son\u2019s wedding, birth of your grandchildren and that you have sufficient funds for aging.

Even without additional information, \"leave\" vs \"honey that's a little harsh\" are on two COMPLETELY different levels. It's super fucked up that you didn't meet that insensitive, discouraging, nasty, disempowering, and just plain mean statement by your husband toward your OWN SON with that same if not MORE energy. And it really does give a great reflection on what that dynamic is pretty much all like and probably has been for quite some time, as your son says. Yes what your son said to your husband was rude and demeaning, but it was a pretty concrete example of reactive abuse. It sounds like you and your husband have probably been shithole parents his entire upbringing ever since he came into the picture. Your son seems pretty fucking resilient, and I wish him all the best in his studies and beyond. On the other hand, you, mom, have some serious soul-searching to do.

Your ignorance about a Physic degree doesn\u2019t give your husband the right to judge others for their decision to pursue the degree. I say ignorant because as someone in STEM, physics degrees go far! But you protect your husband\u2019s right to voice his uneducated opinion and when your son decides to defend himself, you kick him out?\n\n \n\nYay, your son deserves better.

Following the rules of the sub and not sharing the rest of my thoughts.", "Yta, why does your son need to defend himself for getting into higher education? \nAnd of course you pick your husbands side.\nHes going to make himself a great future with no help from you and you will prob come around hoping for money in the future", "YTA. Your kids should come first over someone you're sleeping with, married or not.", "ESH. \n\nYou:  I\u2019m assuming this wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve chosen your husband over your son. YTA for taking sides here and letting your husband put down your son\u2019s career choice in the first place. \n\nHusband: that field of physics is one of the hardest to do and it\u2019s likely your son has thought it through and will have lots of opportunities to help him find his PhD. Lucky for him he likely doesn\u2019t need or want husband\u2019s help. \n\nSon: shouldn\u2019t have told the husband his stupidity led to his career of choice or looked down on mechanics. Mechanics are successful in their own way, educated or not. Husband was stupid for his reaction and comment bc his ego was too fragile to ask or even try to understand what that field of physics was.", "I have a relative that has a PhD in Physics. They had multiple job offers and is making over $140,000 (US) in their first job out of school. They have many skills that are in high demand, so your husband doesn't know what he is talking about!\n\nYTA", "IKR?  Just a quick search on Wikipedia and I found this:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics#Applications\n\nBasically, solid state physics has been responsible for the development of semiconductors, lasers, nanotech, and MRI machines.\n\nOP, since you are on Reddit, I guaranfuckingTEE you that you wrote this post on a machine that WOULDN\u2019T EXIST without solid state physics.  \u201cNo use\u201d my shiny red hiney.  JFC\n\nNot only are you an AH, you are a stupid AH, and what\u2019s worse, a willfully ignorant AH, and you CERTAINLY don\u2019t deserve your son.\n\nYTA, apologize, and DO SOME BASIC RESEARCH before you put your foot in your effing mouth next time!", "She doesn't care, she chose the loser husband a long time ago.", "Hope so otherwise oof", "I told him \"Honey you are being a little harsh.\"", "No she won't clearly she chose her husband over her son years ago and I bet the son's life growing up was hell brought upon by the stepfather that clearly did not like the son. Op reaps what she started back then when she's back here on reddit asking why her son has cut her out of his life completely she wasn't told he got married or has children and that he has sent her a legal c&d to stop contacting him", "This. I wish I could be there to see the \u201csurprised pikachu\u201d look on his parents face when he comes out of grad school debt free with an average starting salary of $160,000 and they won\u2019t see a red cent!", "YTA. Son wouldn\u2019t have said what he said if he hadn\u2019t been hurt and distressed over the comments made by husband. I don\u2019t know any professional (regardless of academic achievement -MD, PHD, JD, etc) that doesn\u2019t value the hell out of a good mechanic. This was a reaction out of anger -and is justified in this context.", "To be fair. A person who can digest anything in physic can easily learn mechanics. Also, anyone can learn mechanics, does not take a genius unlike getting a phd in physics lol", "Solid state physics? That's pretty much a guaranteed job in the big leagues - power converters, battery tech, chip design, energy sector.... That's big money territory - and that's before we start talking think tanks and such.\n\nAnd it's an acceptance, not an application? OP really screwed this one up... Kid is clearly bright as hell to pull that off!\n\nYTA", "They can go into private research and make a lot more than that.", "My ex has his PhD in Physics too. Also had no problem finding a job, makes great money, enough money that he was able to buy a house in his twenties.", "Ya basically if your really good at math you will be able to find a decent job", "Unfortunately. I hope the son finds good friends that support him more than his parents will.", "YTA.\n\nWhat your husband and son said were pretty on par but your reactions were extremely different between the two.", "You know the normal reaction to your kid getting into a PhD program is excitement, right? Like, you get that this is normally a moment of pride? \n\nAlso, how do you know what type of job he can get when you admitted you don\u2019t even understand what it is he\u2019s studying? Have you and DH looked into it at all? I\u2019m guessing not. \n\nYou and DH are TAs here. It sounds like this was just the most recent time your husband was an AH to your son and this was your son\u2019s reaction to his ongoing cruelty and your lack of support.", "Wow.  I don't think it'd be possible to put any less effort into that pathetic attempt at a defense.  At least it's crystal clear for your poor son that you don't give a shit. \n\nYTA", "A little harsh? For completely disregarding and belittling a major life accomplishment? Your husband is insecure and lashing out at your son. You should be bursting with pride, not defending your husband. He deserved to get cussed out.", "So your kid gets kicked out, and your husband gets a very gentle verbal rebuke. No wonder your kid says you favor your husband over him.", "Lmao so you agree with him?", "That's a lie", "Rightfully so.  From the post, you don't sound supportive of your son and you're choosing a man over him.", "Why didn\u2019t you tell him to leave? He started it by disrespecting your son\u2019s very impressive achievement.", "Do you want to never see your son again? Then if so, continue on this path. \n\nIf you enjoy your relationship with your son, you should seriously reconsider how you treat him. However your husbands relationship with him is forever done. Your choice.", "Don't be surprised if your son goes NC... YTA for being a fail parent and choosing a man over your child."]}
