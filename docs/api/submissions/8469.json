You really played yourself.", "YTA for not appreciating his accomplishment.\n\nAnd for the record, if he is going into a PhD program in physics, it likely comes with a fellowship and tuition waivers so that he won\u2019t need your help.

It's super fucked up that you didn't meet that insensitive, discouraging, nasty, disempowering, and just plain mean statement by your husband toward your OWN SON with that same if not MORE energy. And it really does give a great reflection on what that dynamic is pretty much all like and probably has been for quite some time, as your son says. Yes what your son said to your husband was rude and demeaning, but it was a pretty concrete example of reactive abuse. It sounds like you and your husband have probably been shithole parents his entire upbringing ever since he came into the picture. Your son seems pretty fucking resilient, and I wish him all the best in his studies and beyond. On the other hand, you, mom, have some serious soul-searching to do.
