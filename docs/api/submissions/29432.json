{"id": 29432, "submission_id": "17dr0zt", "title": "AITA for blaming my dad for how bad things are at his house and saying he should give up on things improving?", "selftext": "So my dad was with his wife for six years before they got married and they had a daughter together Chantelle (17F). They broke up when she was a baby and in that time dad started dating my mom. By the time I (15M) was born my parents were broken up. And my dad was dating Chantelle's mom again by the time I was 1. She was jealous and hated that dad had a kid with some other woman. She hated my mom for giving dad a son. Things were bad between the three of them. Dad still married her. But by that time mom had gone to court and ordered they communicate through email so it was written and to reduce the hostility I was exposed to. The courts agreed with her.\n\nI don't like my dad's wife. She never hid how much she hated my mom from me but she also tried to claim me as her son. On more than one occasion she asked me why I didn't call her mom and why I didn't invite her to participate in Mother's Day celebrations. She would suggest I should spend more Mother's Days with them and would curse my mom when I'd say no.\n\nChantelle and I hate each other. She would start fights with me over her mom. It was always I didn't appreciate her mom enough, I upset her mom, or my mom was a whore and I shouldn't have loyalty to her. I think Chantelle did believe for a long time that I was an affair baby and not that I was a breakup baby. She only realized the truth when it came out that her mom had an abortion during her parents break up because her mom got pregnant by another guy. And that's a whole other mess.\n\nDad hates that I'm not close to Chantelle. He hates that we do not love each other. And we don't. I don't think we ever loved each other. If we did, it's so long ago that I don't remember it. We avoid each other when we can. We do not claim we have a sibling to other people. I normally talk about just my mom when talking about family. This is something else Chantelle hates because she feels her mom should be acknowledged, blah blah blah.\n\nDad is like an observer. He sees everything going down and he always has the info at hand but he doesn't really think with his brain. Then he'll cry about how much he hates the status quo. A few days ago he wanted to hang out with me and he told me how much he hates that Chantelle and I aren't close. He said we're siblings and we should be supporting each other. He said he wished my mom had intervened more and done better to make sure I was fully integrated into his family. I hated hearing him say that and I told him it was his fault all of this happened, not my mom. I said he chose to be with my mom after he and his wife broke up before and he chose to date her again and then marry her knowing she was jealous that he had a kid with someone else. I told him to own his choices and accept things won't change between us. My dad lost his shit. He was all \"you should be more respectful and you should be willing to help make things better for our family\". I went back to my mom's early because he was still angry. He wants an apology.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697973534, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dr0zt/aita_for_blaming_my_dad_for_how_bad_things_are_at/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was pissed at him and that might have made me TA in that confrontation because he is my dad and he was opening up to me and I brushed off what he was saying and feeling and turned it on him.

Sounds to me like your dad was the one that caused all the tension in the first place rubber-banding back and forth between two women and having two different children. It is definitely not your fault OP, your dad just needs to accept reality.", "NTA\n\n and what ever you do, do not apologise\n\nSome times the truth hurts, he needs to get used to that. All of the hate and animosity are his fault.", "NTA\n\nYour father created this mess and you have nothing to apologise for , He has a nerve suggesting others need to fix what he created\n\nI\u2019m sorry the adults in your life can\u2019t try and find some kind of civility OP but I suggest you try and rise above the drama and know that your feelings are perfectly valid\n\nHave you tried therapy because it may not be a bad idea and may help alleviate some frustration?", "NTA. It was wrong of your dad to forge ahead with that marriage with that toxicity brewing. They should never have spoken ill of your mother to you. If he really wanted to marry this woman, they should have been in counseling to get this resolved before trying to blend a complicated family.\n\nAnd as for your half sister, there is no rule that says siblings always get along. Even full siblings. Sounds like she was following her mom's bad example. You don't owe her a reconciliation.  If she matures and one day offers a sincere apology,  you might consider it, but even then it isn't owed.\n\nYou don't owe any apologies.  Your dad needs to realize he messed up and take responsibility.  He should be making the apology and asking his wife to do the same.", "Your dad didnt do a good job of making you a part of his family. Its his job. Its also his job to make his wife and daughter act better than they do with you. And he should have done a better job with you and how you relate to them. \n\nHis actions or lack of action in his roll as father and husband are why you are at this point. Its not your fault. Though you have your part, you and your sister are still children. Its the parents responsibility for the household environment that the family exists in.", "NTA - all of the adults in your life have let you down to some degree. Maybe they aren\u2019t horrible people, we all make mistakes, but they should have the wisdom now (you\u2019de hope) to recognize those mistakes.\n\nYour father moved on from a women who had his first baby waaaay too soon. Totally reckless that he impregnated another women. Of course the first one feels a sense of betrayal and that she was there first. I\u2019d feel that way, anyone would. Then your mom got involved with a man who had a toddler and got pregnant by him. That was totally a naive decision on her part and she holds responsibility for it. You were born into a very messy situation because both of your parents\u2019 immaturity.\n\nOf course that does not mean your life is worth less. Your life is worth everything and that has nothing to do with the fact that they created a very messy situation for the entire family. Everyone involved here is harbouring VERY natural pain, given the circumstances. If you\u2019re not all going to go to family counselling together then you need to extend grace and forgiveness and understand that your mom and dad created all this. Not his first partner. She\u2019s the only one here who didn\u2019t create this or ask for it. She could have not gone back to him but most young mothers in her shoes would for obvious reasons. They all messed up. Totally makes sense that she treats your mom poorly but accepts you (you\u2019re innocent in this). Even though it\u2019s immature to talk poorly of your parent to you - that\u2019s where this women\u2019s mistakes come in. She\u2019s created extra pain by doing that and totally ruined any relationship you could have had with\nYour sister because you\u2019re both feeling the need to choose sides and stay loyal to your mothers. It\u2019s adult issues they should have kept quiet about for\nYour sake.\n\nWishing you the best and all you can do now is love the people you love, let them have their emotions. It\u2019s raw. And then when you have your own family, don\u2019t repeat this, and you\u2019ll be out of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like, I don't think it was wrong for him to still have feelings for his wife or to want to be with her again. But when he realized the other kid aka me, would be an issue, he should have asked himself if he could make it work really. He doesn't even hide the fact he knew his wife had trouble accepting that he had a child, especially a son, with someone else while they were broken up. He apparently figured it out when they first reconnected. So he had time to try and find a way to help her or to decide he couldn't do it. Instead he did what he wanted and was like I can just blame my son's mom for everything.", "Yep. I think acknowledging that would have helped the conversation we had. Instead of blaming my mom. Because what was she supposed to do? Abandon me so Chantelle's mom could raise me with dad? Take off with me and pretend I had no dad? Know that my dad would end up going back to his ex and having me would create so many issues? I don't know what he thinks mom could do differently.", "yep. and blaming op\u2019s mom for op\u2019s relationship with *his* wife and daughter is rich as hell. someone should have done more to make that go smooth, sure, but that is on him, not op\u2019s mom. nta.", "My mom put me in therapy when I was 5. She knew I would never have the easiest time with the drama going on and so she wanted to try and help me out with that. She put me back in a few times over the years. So I have gone to therapy. It helps.", "This all adults in this situation are just starting families like it\u2019s a pass time. Then surprised kids have issues\u2026.", "I don\u2019t follow the \u2018especially a son\u2019 thing unless you writing from some country were women are worth less then man or a writing for the past.\nThat said. NTA but your father and BOTH mothers are. \nWithin months of divorcing father already started another happy family, and yes your mother was on board with it too. The carelessness in which all adults put both you and your sister in this mess is appealing. \nYou blame your father for going back with his ex wife and she can\u2019t accept you. But he did the same to her when he left her and started another family with your mother. \nAgain the adults in this situation AH. You are a kid and should, not your sister, live in this telenovelas mess.", "Your mom sounds like a great mom. NTA, your dad is an asshole.", "Nah, we're all American. But my dad's wife was never over the fact my mom gave my dad a son and she didn't. The fact my dad had a son who was not hers and it likely made it worse that I didn't like her and would not claim her as any kind of family or parent so she felt even more heated about that. But I heard her bring up the son thing several times.\n\nMy dad and his wife never actually divorced. They only got married for the first time after I was born. They were just dating before that. That ended and both ended up with other people in that time of their breakup.", "Again all adults are AH, break up and in the span of months start other families, the whole concept of \u2018the son\u2019 which belong 1800 circa, the situation in which they put YOU and your sister also. But you absolutely not, nor should apologize."]}
