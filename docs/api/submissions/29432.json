They broke up when she was a baby and in that time dad started dating my mom. By the time I (15M) was born my parents were broken up. And my dad was dating Chantelle's mom again by the time I was 1. She was jealous and hated that dad had a kid with some other woman. She hated my mom for giving dad a son. Things were bad between the three of them. Dad still married her. But by that time mom had gone to court and ordered they communicate through email so it was written and to reduce the hostility I was exposed to. The courts agreed with her.\n\nI don't like my dad's wife. She never hid how much she hated my mom from me but she also tried to claim me as her son. On more than one occasion she asked me why I didn't call her mom and why I didn't invite her to participate in Mother's Day celebrations. She would suggest I should spend more Mother's Days with them and would curse my mom when I'd say no.\n\nChantelle and I hate each other. She would start fights with me over her mom. It was always I didn't appreciate her mom enough, I upset her mom, or my mom was a whore and I shouldn't have loyalty to her. I think Chantelle did believe for a long time that I was an affair baby and not that I was a breakup baby. She only realized the truth when it came out that her mom had an abortion during her parents break up because her mom got pregnant by another guy. And that's a whole other mess.\n\nDad hates that I'm not close to Chantelle. He hates that we do not love each other. And we don't. I don't think we ever loved each other. If we did, it's so long ago that I don't remember it. We avoid each other when we can. We do not claim we have a sibling to other people. I normally talk about just my mom when talking about family. This is something else Chantelle hates because she feels her mom should be acknowledged, blah blah blah.\n\nDad is like an observer. He sees everything going down and he always has the info at hand but he doesn't really think with his brain. Then he'll cry about how much he hates the status quo. A few days ago he wanted to hang out with me and he told me how much he hates that Chantelle and I aren't close. He said we're siblings and we should be supporting each other. He said he wished my mom had intervened more and done better to make sure I was fully integrated into his family. I hated hearing him say that and I told him it was his fault all of this happened, not my mom. I said he chose to be with my mom after he and his wife broke up before and he chose to date her again and then marry her knowing she was jealous that he had a kid with someone else. I told him to own his choices and accept things won't change between us. My dad lost his shit. He was all \"you should be more respectful and you should be willing to help make things better for our family\". I went back to my mom's early because he was still angry. He wants an apology.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697973534, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dr0zt/aita_for_blaming_my_dad_for_how_bad_things_are_at/", "score": 316, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he really wanted to marry this woman, they should have been in counseling to get this resolved before trying to blend a complicated family.\n\nAnd as for your half sister, there is no rule that says siblings always get along. Even full siblings. Sounds like she was following her mom's bad example. You don't owe her a reconciliation.  If she matures and one day offers a sincere apology,  you might consider it, but even then it isn't owed.\n\nYou don't owe any apologies.

Maybe they aren\u2019t horrible people, we all make mistakes, but they should have the wisdom now (you\u2019de hope) to recognize those mistakes.\n\nYour father moved on from a women who had his first baby waaaay too soon. Totally reckless that he impregnated another women. Of course the first one feels a sense of betrayal and that she was there first. I\u2019d feel that way, anyone would. Then your mom got involved with a man who had a toddler and got pregnant by him. That was totally a naive decision on her part and she holds responsibility for it. You were born into a very messy situation because both of your parents\u2019 immaturity.\n\nOf course that does not mean your life is worth less. Your life is worth everything and that has nothing to do with the fact that they created a very messy situation for the entire family. Everyone involved here is harbouring VERY natural pain, given the circumstances. If you\u2019re not all going to go to family counselling together then you need to extend grace and forgiveness and understand that your mom and dad created all this. Not his first partner. She\u2019s the only one here who didn\u2019t create this or ask for it. She could have not gone back to him but most young mothers in her shoes would for obvious reasons. They all messed up. Totally makes sense that she treats your mom poorly but accepts you (you\u2019re innocent in this). Even though it\u2019s immature to talk poorly of your parent to you - that\u2019s where this women\u2019s mistakes come in.

Like, I don't think it was wrong for him to still have feelings for his wife or to want to be with her again. But when he realized the other kid aka me, would be an issue, he should have asked himself if he could make it work really. He doesn't even hide the fact he knew his wife had trouble accepting that he had a child, especially a son, with someone else while they were broken up. He apparently figured it out when they first reconnected. So he had time to try and find a way to help her or to decide he couldn't do it. Instead he did what he wanted and was like I can just blame my son's mom for everything.", "Yep. I think acknowledging that would have helped the conversation we had. Instead of blaming my mom. Because what was she supposed to do? Abandon me so Chantelle's mom could raise me with dad? Take off with me and pretend I had no dad? Know that my dad would end up going back to his ex and having me would create so many issues? I don't know what he thinks mom could do differently.", "yep. and blaming op\u2019s mom for op\u2019s relationship with *his* wife and daughter is rich as hell. someone should have done more to make that go smooth, sure, but that is on him, not op\u2019s mom. nta.", "My mom put me in therapy when I was 5. She knew I would never have the easiest time with the drama going on and so she wanted to try and help me out with that. She put me back in a few times over the years. So I have gone to therapy.

Then surprised kids have issues\u2026.", "I don\u2019t follow the \u2018especially a son\u2019 thing unless you writing from some country were women are worth less then man or a writing for the past.\nThat said. NTA but your father and BOTH mothers are. \nWithin months of divorcing father already started another happy family, and yes your mother was on board with it too. The carelessness in which all adults put both you and your sister in this mess is appealing. \nYou blame your father for going back with his ex wife and she can\u2019t accept you. But he did the same to her when he left her and started another family with your mother. \nAgain the adults in this situation AH. You are a kid and should, not your sister, live in this telenovelas mess.", "Your mom sounds like a great mom. NTA, your dad is an asshole.", "Nah, we're all American. But my dad's wife was never over the fact my mom gave my dad a son and she didn't. The fact my dad had a son who was not hers and it likely made it worse that I didn't like her and would not claim her as any kind of family or parent so she felt even more heated about that. But I heard her bring up the son thing several times.\n\nMy dad and his wife never actually divorced. They only got married for the first time after I was born. They were just dating before that. That ended and both ended up with other people in that time of their breakup.", "Again all adults are AH, break up and in the span of months start other families, the whole concept of \u2018the son\u2019 which belong 1800 circa, the situation in which they put YOU and your sister also.

He blamed your mom for the situation, so he clearly picked a side already. And what would be his solution then?", "Yo OP if he brings it up again ask him why his kids (either of you) need to be the ones to fix problems created by adults. Say you won't be close to your sister because she called your mom a whore, among other things. You two are stuck in a hard place - between dumbass adults. I don't blame you two for not getting along, what she said was unacceptable but I also feel bad for both of you. Chantelle has probably had her head filled with bullshit about how your evil mom is at fault for the way her mom feels ever since she was little. I would also not be surprised she feels bad, wondering why she isn't \"enough\" for her mom and why having a son is soooo important. It was not right for her to take that out on you by trying to force a relationship. If I were you I would not want to stay at that house, sounds unbearable. Do not apologize to your dad for his decisions.", "Your dad can fuck off.\n\nI'm an old bloke but it always amazes me that young people of your age are patronised and criticised for being immature, not being able to make a decision, being unaware of family relationships and the dynamics behind them etc.\n\nYou have articulated the miserable nature of your family dynamic very lucidly and very clearly here. \n\nNot only that, you seem to be the only person with the maturity, insight and understanding to see and appreciate what is really going on and where the blame for this sorry saga lies: your father.\n\nWho we fall in or out of love with is not always under rational, objective control. However, how we handle the consequences of the relationships that follow is firmly in our control.\n\nKnowing the difficulty in the relationship between you and his 'second' family, he could, and should, have acted long ago to ensure a safe and stable environment for the two people that mattered i.e. you and Chantelle.

This was never your mothers problem to fix, and it was always your father, his horrid wife, and his entitled daughters job to not be assholes and continually make a difficult situation worse.\n\nAfter all, the conflict didn't arise because of anything your mother did it's because your mother didn't just vanish into the wind to be convenient to your dads wife. Your dad's wife's inflated ego and self-delusions are 50% of the problem here.", "nta, you hit the nail on the head. dad's big mad because its easier to blame you than accept that he's a fuckup of a father and a husband and he failed you HARD.", "NTA unbelievable a grown man takes so little responsibility for his own actions.", "NTA \n\nYour dad made a lot of shitty choices and these are the consequences.

However, she let her jealousy rule her emotions and now your dad has a family that hates each other. And this all could have been avoided if only your dad had set realistic boundaries to create a healthy family dynamic. \n\nGo live your life without the hate. And maybe one day your half sister might want to have contact with you. When or if that days come, remember she was raised with lies about you and your mom. My advice would be to give her a chance when she is an adult (and I mean an adult with life experience not an adult according to law at the age of 18).", "this family dynamic is, for a lack of better word, toxic to say the least. NTA", "NTA.  You sound like the only realistic, logical, rational adult in the whole bunch.  Your dad failed you by dropping you in this toxic stew of a step \"family\".   What a mess!  I am so sorry you had to grow up in this environment!  What you told him was exactly right.  If anyone owes anyone an apology, he owes you one, for all the nasty crap you have had to listen to about your mother.  If a judge knew about this, your dad would have lost any visitation rights, which is something you may want to consider.  Good luck, OP.  You have a good head on your shoulders, but I know that doesn't take away years of emotional abuse.  Counseling would help your heart heal a great deal,", "NTA. You\u2019re correct this is 100% not your fault, but he & his wife\u2019s.

I\u2019m sorry you continue to blame others instead of taking responsibility for your inaction and avoidance.\u201d", "NTA\nThe next time your dad says something about it tell him that he doesn't automatically command respect from you just because he knocked up your mom. Even respect from your children has to be earned. In order for him to earn that respect he needed to defend you, respect you and your situation, and hold them all accountable for their own actions (including him, his wife, and his daughter.) He failed at that. He failed at being a respectable parent and you aren't required nor should you feel obligated to respect someone who obviously holds every other person in higher regard than you. \nOh and don't ever apologize for it. Your mom seems to be the only person who deserves respect.", "NTA, Chantelle and your father are the real idiots, their stupidity denied you and your sister a good sibling relationship.", "NTA\n\nThis is the apology I'd give him:\n\nI'm sorry Dad, exactly why do I need to clean up the mess your wandering dick made?", "NTA. He just doesn't want to deal with the chaos he caused.  \nTell him you'll apologize after he does, with a sincere apology, for everything his actions and inactions have done to effect you, then list everything!", "NTA", "NTA. Your dad needed to hear the truth. You cannot complain that things didn't go as you expected to when you are the cause of all of this mess. Then he flips out when you tell him his truth and expects an apology because he can't own up to the fact that he created this turmoil. Why would he expect your sister and you to be close given the circumstances? Why would he expect your mom to put in the work for his mess? Why did he not control his wife when her anger was misdirected to you and your mother instead of your dad? I would 100% not apologize because your dad needs to wake up, smell the roses, and learn that his choices led to a traumatic and unsolvable family situation. Who knows, maybe as you age your sister and your relationship will improve as adults. Limit your time with your father, create boundaries and reiterate them to him, don't make him manipulate you into being the fixer of the family, and learn from his mistakes that he doesn't even know he made. He can observe all he wants but he needs to start by observing his crap and taking accountability as an adult. Update your mom on this situation and DO NOT apologize.", "You are NTA.\n\nYou are 100% right that the mess is that of your father's and its his responsibility to clean it up. If it even can be. Which at this point, I doubt. In that case, he needs to learn to accept responsibility for his actions and stop expecting you and your mother to accept the blame.\n\nYour step-mother, Chantelle and Father are TA here. What I'm not getting/sure of is why many of the comments down below are throwing your mothing into that mix as well. From what I've read, the only thing your mom did was force communication through the courts to alleviate the negative impact on you. And that to me was a good parent. Nowhere does it say she stirred the arguing and fighting with your dad or within his household. And she didn't cheat with your father as it seems everyone agrees that him and his now wife were broken up at the time and both took up relations with someone else during that time. We don't know what your dad told her; if it was an agreed upon fling of the moment or if your dad promised something more long term or if it was just a wait and see where things go. So, as far as I am concerned, your mother is NTA.\n\nI don't understand the entitlement that your step-mother has to want or need to be called mom or involved in any Mother's Day events. She's not your mother and I'd say as much to shut things down. She can get over it. If she wants to be mad about it, then she can be mad at your father and direct her ire there. As for Chantelle, I'm not sure what she means by \"acknowledged\". If she means as your mother or parental figure, then hell no! But if she just means treated with some basic respect as a person or adult of the household (under your dad's roof), the I can understand that. I'm not saying be her bff or anything. But a \"no ma'am\"/\"yes ma'am\", \"please/thank you\", \"hello\", etc wouldn't hurt.\n\nAny way you slice it though, you're father is square in the middle of all the blame and needs to take a hard look at himself and his life.\n\nAgain, you are NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe didn't like hearing the truth spoken.\n\nHere's some more truth for him. He should have stepped in all the years that his wife has been bad mouthing your mother.", "TBH, why are you even hanging out with him and having any contact with either his wife or Chantelle?  Is there court-mandated visitation?  Chantelle goes to the same school?\n\nSounds like you might be both of the age and the mindset to just chop the rope linking you to this sinking ship of your dad's.", "NTA. You are now old enough that if you wanted to, in most jurisdictions, assuming you are in the US that you and Mom can request an update to any court ordered custody and your choice of if you want visitation with your dad or not. \n\nYour step mom seems to be trying to alienate you from your mother which is also frowned upon by courts, the only one in this situation that seems to have your best interests in mind is your mother.\n\nYou could ask your mom to contact her family lawyer to adjust custody and that you would like to not visit with your dad unless it is a supervised visit because of how your step family treats you when you are over there.", "I don\u2019t think your dad has ever actually thought that far. It sounds like he\u2019s built a story in his head about the family and the status quo *has* to be your mum\u2019s fault because he can\u2019t accept any responsibility for himself for creating this situation, including getting angry at his wife for so clearly resenting you. This story is his shield against ever having to admit he\u2019s messed up and the constant complaints about the status quo are seeking your validation of his story. When you refuse to do this and share your own story of the family he can\u2019t reconcile it because it requires him to both adjust his story to fit yours and accept responsibility. It\u2019s the start of [missing missing reasons.](https://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html)", "It's classic affirmation-seeking. If everyone plays the happy family, I didn't just fuck up everyone's lives on whims and emotions. If my kids get along together and we all pretend we're the perfect blended family I've seen on TV (but rarely IRL), then I actually never did anything *that* bad. So they convince themselves that any resistance to their narrative is the actual problem, and it's definitely not their actions that led up to this that could be responsible.  \n\nI'd say that you see this complex in a majority of \"AITA for not wanting to call my dad's 6th wife Mom?\" -type posts; someone resents that reality is butting heads with their affirmation fantasy, takes it out on the rest of the family for not complying and playing pretend, and then everyone is mad."]}
