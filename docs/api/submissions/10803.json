He was SCREAMING at me, BLAMING ME for not showing up (uninvited still) to the proposal with her parents because she was upset they weren\u2019t there\u2026 I was fucking slack jawed. \n\nI told him I knew this would happen, and He says VERBATIM \u201cyou just admitted you knew this would happen, so If you knew the whole time and you actually cared about her, you would have invited them.\u201d\n\nI was Gob smacked and hung up on him. Not even an hour later I get a call from her asking me to come to her parents. According to her, this is how the situation played out: he popped the q, she said yes and the people he invited popped out from hiding. She was bombarded by 4 of his guy friends, his mom, dad, older brother and his sister in law. His parents were holding a sign that read \u201cwelcome to the family, Mrs.(insert his last name here)\u201d and this is where things go down hill. \n\nI did not know this before (and I thought I knew everything), but my friend doesn\u2019t want to change her last name, and she\u2019s told him that repeatedly since they got together. She\u2019s an only child from a Ukrainian family and with everything going on with Ukraine in the last year she\u2019s doubled down.\n\nWhen she saw the sign she joked \u201cMrs.(his last name)? I think you mean Mrs.(her last name)!\u201d Everyone went silent until his mom said \u201cWell the ring is already engraved, no changing it now!\u201d She takes the ring off and see\u2019s \u201cMrs.(his last name)\u201d engraved on the band.\n\nThen she asked if her parents were coming. He gave every excuse: He didn\u2019t have their number, there were too many people there, he wanted to keep it private and eventually said \u201cThis was my proposal to you and now My family is your family. We can just send your parents the pictures later.\u201d\n\nSHE TOOK THE RING OFF AND LEFT. That\u2019s when I\u2019m assuming I got that call from him. She went straight to her parents. She asked them about the engagement, they were clueless. She then asked if I knew anything. I asked if she was in the right place, she said she was, so I told her I would answer any question she had (rather than dumping everything on her).\n\nShe was upset but thanked me. She was furious when I told her about the call from him earlier and said \u201cdoes he really think I\u2019m that shallow?\u201d She said it wasnt about having a perfect proposal or her parents there, it was about him making the whole thing about himself as always and she was done feeling ignored and belittled. So this was her breaking point. \n\nShe\u2019s staying with her parents currently and has been receiving texts from him. The worst one so far is him telling her she has to pay him back for the ring and for ruining his life. Right now, all I can do is be here for her, and whatever decision she makes, I will fully support because, as you\u2019ve all helped me realize, this isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about her. Not my monkey, not my circus.\n\nEdit: she gave him the ring back when she took it off, I didn\u2019t include that because I was at the 3,000 character limit already.", "created_utc": 1677257494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11avzan/update_aita_if_i_tell_my_friend_her_bf_is/", "score": 1847, "replies": ["Thank you so much for the update!  I've been looking for it all week.  I'm so proud of your friend, it must have been so hard to take the ring off and walk away in front of all of HIS people.  She has saved herself such hardship and trauma by nipping it in the bud.  I can't believe that he thinks that she should pay for it after he had it engraved with something he knows she didn't want - it seems that he and his family were trying to force her to take their name.

Well thanks for the update! This is so bad and I\u2019m glad she is no longer with him because he straight up wanted her as his property. She is soooooooo much better off and I\u2019m glad she has you for a friend!", "He told on himself, that's really the best outcome. Glad you're there for her!", "Sounds like things played out just as they were supposed to.  Now you can just be there for your friend and support her as friends do.  He sounds like a complete AH.", "NTA.\n\nAnd your friend should run. \n\nRun as fast as she can, and don't dare turn around to look back. \n\nThis is red flag central.", "Oh I\u2019m so glad she dodged that bullet and she has you there for her.", "I\u2019m so sorry your friend had to go through all of that but sadly it had to happen. you had to let him go through with it and fuck up. it really opened her eyes. you did the right thing & I hope your friend heals", "Thank you for the update, for some reason I was really invested in the outcome.\n\nI am glad she dodged that bullet. The fact that the only emotion he is capable of - when the woman he wanted to marry and spend the rest of his life with dumps him - is anger, says a lot. Even without all the rest.\n\nI am glad she understands that you are not to blame for any of this.\nAll the best to you and your friend.", "I hope she doesn\u2019t move ahead with marrying into this family. I dated a man like this who had zero regard for me, my family and didn\u2019t know me at all. Same old well my family is yours now so your family doesn\u2019t quite count. This is basically what is meant by this behavior. Nobody in my husbands family cared or asked why I didn\u2019t take their name. It was a non issue. Also, it seems that she wasn\u2019t comfortable with this obnoxious proposal. Why can\u2019t proposals just be between the couple and then have a party later if you want to celebrate. You put someone on the spot when you do that so they have no choice but to say yes. I know there are some women who want this type of proposal but it seems like ops friend isn\u2019t one of them. I\u2019m not either. My husband proposed when we were in the living room in our pjs watching tv and we had a nice conversation about it and I called my family after", "Thank you for the update! And wow, I hope your friend does not go through with this marriage, he really seems like a genuine narcissist. And good on her for wanting to keep her surname!", "1. The BF sounds like a real piece of work. If your friend decides to take the relationship further, she is in for an unpleasant drive. Not only the BF, but it looks like his parents and his inner circle are on board with his behavior. This can get dangerous; especially if he succeeds in alienating her from her family and friends.\n\n2. The only way to prevent alienation is to make sure your friend knows that her people are there for her; no matter what. \n\n3. You have already taken the steps in the right direction. She seems like a smart woman. She will make the right decision. But those are her decisions to make. You can only offer her support.\n\n4.

He needs to leave this poor girl alone. So glad they aren't getting married. She deserves better.", "I remember your post. This guy sounds like a complete and utter asshole and that\u2019s putting it lightly. She is way better off without him.", "Yeah, that proposal plan was always going to be a shit show", "Wow!  I hope the woman totally breaks off with her would-be fianc\u00e9.  His behavior here has a ton of red flags. \n\nAfter reading the original post, I can only shake my head.  How can someone be with a girlfriend for **five years** and not care that her family is hugely important to her?", "YES!  This was the update I was waiting for. \n\nThat is all.", "I'm so glad she dodged that bullet.  This explosion was exactly what she needed to see him for who he really.  Don't see why he needs to be repaid for the ring, though.  It says \"Mrs. HisLastName\".  He can just pass it to the next girl he gets with.  Doesn't sound below him to recycle a ring.", "Good for you. I know you wanted to protect your friend but sometimes we gotta let things play out and clean up the mess after.", "I\u2019m so happy to see this update. Your poor friend, her heart must be reeling, but she will be so much better off without this asshole in her life. \n\nPlus, fuck him. What an absolute, total prick he is.

I take my friendships very seriously but my loyalty can sometimes come off toxic and get me into trouble. I see now that the most important thing in a friendship is recognizing the autonomy of the other person and respecting that they can make their own decisions, whether they are good or bad, because it\u2019s their life, not mine. I\u2019ve realize now that the times in my life where I overstepped, I was being a bad friend because it comes off as if I don\u2019t have faith in my friends ability to judge things for themselves. You can\u2019t always protect or prevent things from happening to the people you love, you can only support them to the extent they want to be supported.", "Oh yeah she doesn\u2019t have it, she gave it back when she took it off", "Just remembered the \"engraving\" part so yeah he probably won't be able to return it but he could definitely sell it for the exact price he paid for it", "Depending on the state/country, she might have even been able to keep the ring and not pay him, lol. She shouldn't in this situation, but I could see someone being strung along for a couple of years, it ends up being morally okay to keep the ring", "Usually can't return an engraved item.", "Exactly! He might as well have branded her. \n\nIf she had accepted the ring, she would've sold herself (and any future children) to his whole family and been expected to put her own family last.", "Don't be sad for her friend, be happy that her friend is now out of a toxic relationship.", "If you had read the post, OP stated that the way her friend was treated and her wishes regarding keeping her last name were ignored, she took off the ring, left it behind, and that it was the final straw. The friend said she\u2019s not going to stay with someone who kept belittling her, so no, she\u2019s not going to go through with marrying this guy.", "He engraved the ring. It's usually hard to return them once engraved.", "One thing I\u2019ve realized here too is that it actually didn\u2019t go as I predicted. I expected her to be upset that her family wasn\u2019t there, but she\u2019s expressed to me that was not the issue. The issue was that the proposal was just another example of his selfishness and in that moment she said she saw what her life would look like with him, and despite being with him for 5 years, it took the possibility of being legally bound to him for her to see things clearly.", "She did! That\u2019s what was meant by \u201cshe took the ring off\u201d", "He probably wants her to pay him for it because he got it engraved and can't return it.

Kinda sucks for the man. He woulda deserved it", "She didn't tell her friend, she followed the advice from the other post. Only after when the friend asked and OP confirmed the friend was ready to hear did OP tell her what fully happened, which was a good call to make.", "\"update\"", "Dude, this was my initial way of thinking which is why I wanted to tell her in the beginning, but after fighting for my life in the comments of the original post and taking time to really think rationally about it, there was really no positive outcome in the situation. The choices I had were either interfere or don\u2019t, and when you weigh those options, not interfering was always the right decision. He put me in that position, but if I stepped in I would have taken all the heat away from him. At the end of the day, I trusted that my best friend would understand, and she did.", "I agree for myself, but to be fair to OP, she made her original post asking if she should and was overwhelmingly told she would be a giant AH for getting involved and to keep her nose out of it, so I understand why she didn't. Gets kinda hard to continue to think you're in the right when so many people are telling you you're wrong", "This was almost exactly what I cautioned in my comment on the original post \u2014 that, instead of relying on random Redditors\u2019 opinions, OP needed to ask *herself* if her friend (1) would forgive her for knowing and staying silent after the proposal inevitably went to heck in a hand basket, which it did, and (2) if her friend would believe her if the boyfriend threw her under the bus afterwards, which he did. \n\nLike you, I would\u2019ve been pretty angry/felt betrayed by OP if I were the friend because it sounds like this was a dramatic and miserable experience that  could\u2019ve been partially/entirely avoided if OP had given her friend a heads up. On the other hand, I\u2019ve realized that I often reach the opposite conclusion from many people on this sub when it comes to friendship conflicts, so I think I may have different expectations of my friends than most, lol.", "Maybe I have had my head in the sand, but i've never heard of engraving before marriage.  It's so disrespectful and possessive.  Maybe he should give it to his mom, lol.", "The engraving would have driven me. It makes it all about him. An engagement ring is something you wear forever, why would you put something on it you know your partner doesn\u2019t want? What a raging narcissist.", "Yep, he completely ignored everything she had said to him. Lucky escape for her.", "Yeah - that's the toxic icing on the cake.", "Honestly - who puts Mrs. HisLastName on a ring? I guess some people do, but on an engagement ring? I didn't even engrave my wife's wedding ring. That is pretty presumptuous of him and leads to the thought he's full on narcissistic. He is a narcissist that fully believed she would just be submissive and bow to his wishes. I bet he figured if he got the name on the ring she couldn't object.", "Freal! My fiance and I have been very open about the whole process of getting engaged. I told him very specifically that I didn't want a diamond and I didn't want something super expensive and so we went and picked out my ring together. It's been nearly a year now that we've been engaged and we're getting married in July, and we only just definitively decided like last week that I was changing my name. It's been one of those conversations that we kind of started a couple of times and we came to a little bit of a stalemate but not in an angry way. Like we had just discussed it and not come to a conclusion, as opposed to started an argument and then went away angry. Part of that had to do with the fact that we were trying to decide what changing my name meant for my son. \n\nI cannot imagine just being so clear up front that I did not want to change my name and then having that absolutely steamrolled. If I were that girl I would dump everything and run.", "[removed]", "But she's still TA in his eyes because... she didn't go behind his back to try to sneak the friend's parents to his proposal?

If I am not protecting myself, then I am not containing myself either. If I have been letting others crash my boundaries, guess what? Yup, I have been crashing theirs. That realization opens you up to a major personal growth spurt. And it has. I hope you will be proud of that.  If you need help feeling ok letting others suffer their pains, read \u201cman\u2019s search for meaning\u201d by Victor Frankyl.  From that book I learned that our suffering is part of our process, and that it is arrogant of me to think I know better than the universe that your suffering must be prevented or stopped. I know that my own suffering (mistakes) have changed my own course and who I am. For that, I am grateful. They will feel similarly, but it is up to them, not me.", "I didn't read the first post originally but did now. I don't think you were co-dependent or nosey.

This girl already wasted 5 years and her friend chose to let her waste even more time because of social media. This is why I don't post personal issues about my life on social media. I just keep it to myself and work through it on my own. I even let my husband read both posts and he completely agrees with me as well that she should have been told sooner. He was showing major red flags of abuse and every girl should be warned before it's gets worse.

So that's why I say, kuddos to her friend because that wouldn't be me.", "Exactly this! You said it better than I did and I guess we have the same view of how true friendships should work. Your friend is supposed to look out for you and be there for you through stuff like this. Not just sit back and watch it burn. I couldn't watch my friend go through something like that.
