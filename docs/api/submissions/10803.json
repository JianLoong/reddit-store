He was SCREAMING at me, BLAMING ME for not showing up (uninvited still) to the proposal with her parents because she was upset they weren\u2019t there\u2026 I was fucking slack jawed. \n\nI told him I knew this would happen, and He says VERBATIM \u201cyou just admitted you knew this would happen, so If you knew the whole time and you actually cared about her, you would have invited them.\u201d\n\nI was Gob smacked and hung up on him. Not even an hour later I get a call from her asking me to come to her parents. According to her, this is how the situation played out: he popped the q, she said yes and the people he invited popped out from hiding. She was bombarded by 4 of his guy friends, his mom, dad, older brother and his sister in law. His parents were holding a sign that read \u201cwelcome to the family, Mrs.(insert his last name here)\u201d and this is where things go down hill. \n\nI did not know this before (and I thought I knew everything), but my friend doesn\u2019t want to change her last name, and she\u2019s told him that repeatedly since they got together. She\u2019s an only child from a Ukrainian family and with everything going on with Ukraine in the last year she\u2019s doubled down.\n\nWhen she saw the sign she joked \u201cMrs.(his last name)? I think you mean Mrs.(her last name)!\u201d Everyone went silent until his mom said \u201cWell the ring is already engraved, no changing it now!\u201d She takes the ring off and see\u2019s \u201cMrs.(his last name)\u201d engraved on the band.\n\nThen she asked if her parents were coming. He gave every excuse: He didn\u2019t have their number, there were too many people there, he wanted to keep it private and eventually said \u201cThis was my proposal to you and now My family is your family. We can just send your parents the pictures later.\u201d\n\nSHE TOOK THE RING OFF AND LEFT. That\u2019s when I\u2019m assuming I got that call from him. She went straight to her parents. She asked them about the engagement, they were clueless. She then asked if I knew anything. I asked if she was in the right place, she said she was, so I told her I would answer any question she had (rather than dumping everything on her).\n\nShe was upset but thanked me. She was furious when I told her about the call from him earlier and said \u201cdoes he really think I\u2019m that shallow?\u201d She said it wasnt about having a perfect proposal or her parents there, it was about him making the whole thing about himself as always and she was done feeling ignored and belittled. So this was her breaking point. \n\nShe\u2019s staying with her parents currently and has been receiving texts from him. The worst one so far is him telling her she has to pay him back for the ring and for ruining his life. Right now, all I can do is be here for her, and whatever decision she makes, I will fully support because, as you\u2019ve all helped me realize, this isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about her. Not my monkey, not my circus.\n\nEdit: she gave him the ring back when she took it off, I didn\u2019t include that because I was at the 3,000 character limit already.", "created_utc": 1677257494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11avzan/update_aita_if_i_tell_my_friend_her_bf_is/", "score": 22658, "replies": ["Thank you so much for the update!  I've been looking for it all week.  I'm so proud of your friend, it must have been so hard to take the ring off and walk away in front of all of HIS people.  She has saved herself such hardship and trauma by nipping it in the bud.  I can't believe that he thinks that she should pay for it after he had it engraved with something he knows she didn't want - it seems that he and his family were trying to force her to take their name.

But now you\u2019re the supportive friend.", "I am glad you didn't insinuate yourself, and while I am sad for your friend at how things went - it was exactly as you predicted and showed him for his true self ... which sadly seems to be reflected in his family. \n\nShe needs to block him and his family, time to move on.", "Holy god! Well thanks for the update! This is so bad and I\u2019m glad she is no longer with him because he straight up wanted her as his property. She is soooooooo much better off and I\u2019m glad she has you for a friend!", "He told on himself, that's really the best outcome. Glad you're there for her!", "Sounds like things played out just as they were supposed to.  Now you can just be there for your friend and support her as friends do.  He sounds like a complete AH.", "NTA.\n\nAnd your friend should run. \n\nRun as fast as she can, and don't dare turn around to look back. \n\nThis is red flag central.", "Oh I\u2019m so glad she dodged that bullet and she has you there for her.", "I\u2019m so sorry your friend had to go through all of that but sadly it had to happen. you had to let him go through with it and fuck up. it really opened her eyes. you did the right thing & I hope your friend heals", "Thank you for the update, for some reason I was really invested in the outcome.\n\nI am glad she dodged that bullet. The fact that the only emotion he is capable of - when the woman he wanted to marry and spend the rest of his life with dumps him - is anger, says a lot. Even without all the rest.\n\nI am glad she understands that you are not to blame for any of this.\nAll the best to you and your friend.", "I hope she doesn\u2019t move ahead with marrying into this family. I dated a man like this who had zero regard for me, my family and didn\u2019t know me at all. Same old well my family is yours now so your family doesn\u2019t quite count. This is basically what is meant by this behavior. Nobody in my husbands family cared or asked why I didn\u2019t take their name. It was a non issue. Also, it seems that she wasn\u2019t comfortable with this obnoxious proposal. Why can\u2019t proposals just be between the couple and then have a party later if you want to celebrate. You put someone on the spot when you do that so they have no choice but to say yes. I know there are some women who want this type of proposal but it seems like ops friend isn\u2019t one of them. I\u2019m not either. My husband proposed when we were in the living room in our pjs watching tv and we had a nice conversation about it and I called my family after", "Thank you for the update! And wow, I hope your friend does not go through with this marriage, he really seems like a genuine narcissist. And good on her for wanting to keep her surname!", "1. The BF sounds like a real piece of work. If your friend decides to take the relationship further, she is in for an unpleasant drive. Not only the BF, but it looks like his parents and his inner circle are on board with his behavior. This can get dangerous; especially if he succeeds in alienating her from her family and friends.\n\n2. The only way to prevent alienation is to make sure your friend knows that her people are there for her; no matter what. \n\n3. You have already taken the steps in the right direction. She seems like a smart woman. She will make the right decision. But those are her decisions to make. You can only offer her support.\n\n4.

He needs to leave this poor girl alone. So glad they aren't getting married. She deserves better.", "I remember your post. This guy sounds like a complete and utter asshole and that\u2019s putting it lightly. She is way better off without him.", "Yeah, that proposal plan was always going to be a shit show", "Wow!  I hope the woman totally breaks off with her would-be fianc\u00e9.  His behavior here has a ton of red flags. \n\nAfter reading the original post, I can only shake my head.  How can someone be with a girlfriend for **five years** and not care that her family is hugely important to her?", "YES!  This was the update I was waiting for. \n\nThat is all.", "I'm so glad she dodged that bullet.  This explosion was exactly what she needed to see him for who he really.  Don't see why he needs to be repaid for the ring, though.  It says \"Mrs. HisLastName\".  He can just pass it to the next girl he gets with.  Doesn't sound below him to recycle a ring.", "Good for you. I know you wanted to protect your friend but sometimes we gotta let things play out and clean up the mess after.", "I\u2019m so happy to see this update. Your poor friend, her heart must be reeling, but she will be so much better off without this asshole in her life. \n\nPlus, fuck him. What an absolute, total prick he is.

It really cemented for me that he was my person. I hope she finds someone who cares and listens to her as much as you do one day.

I take my friendships very seriously but my loyalty can sometimes come off toxic and get me into trouble.

At that point I said yes, but it's not a temporary break, give me my ring back.\n\nIt was a gift from my stepfather, who had proposed to the woman he was married to before my mom with it knowing I was planning to get engaged, so I really felt that it was more disrespectful to him to not get it back than to just let her have it.\n\nI also really feel like she did that to herself by treating a commitment like that so casually.", "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/935\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineko_Iwasaki\n\nYou should also check out Geisha of Gion.

We had to do a legal separation because of how you handle dealing with the house for non married spouses, and the lawyer told me point blank I must return the ring or he could sue me for full appraised value, even though he bought it on sale.", "I wish I could like this comment a million times!! OP needs to reassure the friend that she made the right call and these signs are huge warnings about what married life will be like. Won\u2019t change your name? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll just push and push. Don\u2019t want to raise our kids this way? Too bad, I\u2019m the man so we do it my way. Don\u2019t want to visit my parents for Christmas?

He probably told his mom and dad or his friends that she wanted to keep her name, and that was all a preemptive strike to persuade/coerce her to take his.

From reading the original thread this guy was sending out emotional abuser red flags. \n\nDoesn\u2019t want to make an effort to spend time with her family, insist she be involved in his family, doesn\u2019t involve her best friend in the proposal when she did all the leg work, doesn\u2019t include her family in the proposal either, but wants his family and friends there. This read to me that he was trying to isolate her from friends and family to better control her. \n\nI feel like I have ESP after reading this update. He made it out to be like his family and friends were all that mattered because that will be her new family (and probably only family from his perspective) Then, THEN, he put his last name on the ring despite the fact that she was very vocal she was keeping hers!? Ah, chef\u2019s kiss. That was a power play. He probably figured if he forced it on her, she would just cave. He didn\u2019t want to marry her, he wanted to absorb her, and make her an extension of himself and his family. Also, he\u2019s not taking one crumb of responsibility. Classic. \n\nGood on you for letting it all play out. Good on her for walking away. The red flags here were so big, they might as well have been a blanket.", "I admire her for not settling despite how far along they were/are. He ignored literally every wish of hers she has consistently communicated with him and ignored every wish of hers you communicated with him.

A surprise proposal with none of the intended-fianc\u00e9e's support network and all of the fiance's, and an expensive ring with the wrong name on it, this was an ambush to, among other things, pressure OP's friend into backing down on her intent to keep her last name. I've had a friend who had a public proposals to the man's benefit, with a motive that there is social pressure to say \"Yes, of course I will.\" She actually was unsure about the prospect of marrying the man, and the surprise, very public proposal pressured a \"Yes\" out of her. She later realized it, and broke off the engagement. \n\nA massive bullet dodged indeed.", "with that statement, he's literally saying \"my family can be privy to our private life, but not yours.\" The \"we can just send them a picture or something\" was just the icing on the cake.

People like that are so dangerous to people who are malleable.", "If he can swing to blame to OP it is the first step in driving a wedge between op and the bride", "So I researched it, and laws are all over the place concerning the ring. If you live in a state where it considered a gift (most states), and either it's a no-fault state, or the ring-donor calls it off (if it's a fault state), you might be legally required to return it. In other cases, you may not.\n\nIn any case, from a historical and etiquette standpoint, it's a gift, and demanding it back is tacky. I'm not sure how relevant it is this story, since ultimately the proposal was rejected before plans had moved ahead very far. She's not keeping the ring.\n\nBut from my viewpoint, the engraved ring was a faux pas, even without the name problem. The idea that an engagement ring is part of some ownership over her is a ridiculous concept. To ask the mirror question to what others have asked: what is HE going to do with the rejected ring?\n\nIt's best not to engrave engagements rings in such as a fashion. If a proposal falls through, someone (whether giver or recipient) is likely to have to sell, return, or re-use the ring. If the recipient chooses not to wear it after marriage, likewise, it may make sense to sell it at some point. And it's considerably less valuable as an heirloom if it's a valuable ring; it would only be useful if the heirs are in a situation where the name is correct.", "I think it depends on who did the breaking up or the situation. Like, here, she originally accepted (even if briefly), then realized he's a tool (along with his family), said no thanks, and returned the ring. If she had accepted, and later he broke up with her or, she broke up with him because he had cheated on her or got abusive, then she keeps the ring. If they had actually gotten married and stayed together for at least a little while, I think she gets to keep it regardless. But like someone said, it might depend on where they live. But, I would think he can just return or sell the ring and the engraving can be removed. It probably wasn't her style anyway, lol. What do you want to bet she likes delicate, simple jewelry and he bought her a big, old honking atrocity?", "That want laziness.

Can be returned", "And really I\u2019m the victim because you\u2019re making me feel bad right now.", "\"and if I did, it's because you made me\" was my ex's favorite line.  \nCrazy how these six lines can trigger so much. I really hope OPs friend doesn't go through with the marriage. This guy is such bad news.", "Seriously. Name change is one of those things that should be discussed with your significant other if you think they\u2019re the one you want to marry. \n\nWhen my wife and I started talking about marriage, long before I proposed, I told her outright that changing her last name was entirely her decision. If she wanted to (which is what she ended up doing), I was all for it.

XXX\", its a backup plan to make it transferable.", "Depends. If you propose on Christmas or Valentines day then in some places you get to keep the ring even if the marriage didnt happen.

That was flouting tradition - in the original post, OP even says the friend would have wanted BF to ask or talk to her parents about this because she's traditional.", "He considers his family and friends close and personal, and thinks she should too, but thinks her family are just some other acquaintances they happen to know.", "How did the cat react", "People can get hung up on the stupidest things.\n\nDue to some personal beliefs of theirs, my parents gave me (29F) a different last name than theirs and I take pride in it, which is why I will never change it.
