Jesus, they didn't even give you birthday parties but threw them for your other siblings? And then they got MAD that they wanted to do something for your birthday? I can't stand parents who punish a living child all because of a child who (tragically and unfortunately) passed away. Your parents need serious grief counseling. It's been twenty-nine years; they cannot continue to punish you for your sister passing away.", "NTA\n\nYour parents and you suffered a terrible loss; I'm sorry. You, however are living and apparently thriving and therefore you must do what you need to to continue your journey in life unencumbered by your parents' rituals.", "NTA but clearly you need family therapy. I think you have a lot you need to get out of your chest and they should also realized that they putting a burden on your shoulders that shouldn\u2019t be yours.\nMy heart goes out to you. As a mom, I don\u2019t know if I could have survived losing my child when when you have other children, you need to push through for them. But you cannot ask them to compensate for what you lost.\nYour parents clearly need therapy.\nYou need to protect yourself.", "NTA.\n\nThis comment is for OP's Parents, should this post ever somehow get made known to you: \n\nWhile I sympathize for the loss of your child, your behavior on the day of this incident towards your flesh and blood who is alive and healthy today is completely unacceptable. You don't know what they feel deep down inside. A person can have their own unique ways of remembering someone who has passed.\n\nSecondly, you get mad that your living child, for whom you seem to exhibit no sense of appreciation for (based on information deduced from the celebration of birthdays), decides they are going to celebrate their birthday, rather than just spend the whole day grieving about someone they had no connection to BECAUSE THEY WERE FOUR MONTHS OLD. Can either of you remember anything from when you were four months old? If not, how can you expect your living child to?\n\nFinally, I can understand having a ritual to honor your lost one's memory, but forcing it upon the child that did live, then lashing out at them because they didn't act exactly like you do is totally out of line. \n\nYou have problems with yourselves that you need to sort out. Your child has been burdened with this loss because of you and your actions. You need to get right with yourselves and whatever higher power you account to. \n\nYou have already suffered the loss of one child, but if your continue to act this way you will lose your other child, and they will become a monument to all your sins.\n\nDo not let yourselves lose them, because it is easily avoidable.", "NTA \n\nYour parents have been neglecting the child that did survive. I'm sorry. Idk why they expect you to cry for someone you don't remember and barely knew.", "NTA. 1) Everyone processes grief differently, some just don't cry at times like that. 2) It's kinda hard to grieve someone you never really met or grew to know in any way.", "NTA you're 29 years old, your parents raising their voice to you like an errant child is not ok. And life is for the living. The fact that they've never celebrated you sucks.", "NTA.\n\nI would tell your parents directly - so you think, I should have died too, so I would get a party and sympathy on my birthday? I know you grieve, I know it is hard for you. But I'm alive. I'm here. Could I please have my birthday like all my siblings. We can still mourn her on her day of death. But this is not a fairy tail, I don't miss someone I never knew. I'm not just half a person without my twin. Although you treated my like a shadow of my death sibling. So please love me for the person, I'm by myself. Give me the same treatment as my siblings - or you will loose me too, because you only see me as half a person allways part of a death loved one", "Inform them they've been neglecting the child they didn't loose for 29 years. \n\nIt's quite common to transfer feelings, especially traumatic ones, onto other's. Considering she was your twin I would presume they've done this most of, if not your whole life.\n\nThey need to get to therapy and specifically tackle this transference. As much as I can understand trauma making it hard to control this, it is unbelievably cruel to effectively \"blame\" the child who lived for not grieving over your twin sister, whom you never really got to build an attachment to before she passed. \n\nThe fact that they never celebrated your birthday while throwing big parties for your other siblings, they have been punishing you your entire life for something out of your control. \n\nThey've lived your whole life in negligence, personally I would not tolerate this any further.   \nFamily therapy is probably the collectively right place to start, however if they refuse, I would threaten to go low / no contact. They need to let you live your life, or maybe they  need to feel how life is living without the child whom lived as well.. for them to stop this absurdity.   \nThat's just how I would've handled it, how you want to proceed is 100% up to you and what you feel is right for you.   \nYou don't owe your parents anything for bringing you into this world, they owe you for how they've neglected you. And you owe it to yourself to stop this treatment they've been imposing on you. \n\nNTA in any way, your parents are TA, possibly have been your whole life.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I genuinely think your parents need some help? Like grieve-counselling. My guess it, that there is a lot of complicated feelings pent up in them over the last two decades and a glimpse of it came out in weird way ...", "NTA. Im mean, I'd throw in their face how they always celebrate their dead daughter and not a single time celebrated their living one. They are the ones that are heartless enough to basically shove you in the background shadow of a dead person.", "NTA\n\nWhile the death was tragic, you shouldn't be banned from living a normal life because of it. You are more than just the surviving half of a set of twins. You are a living person, who should enjoy concerts, and birthdays, and time with your friends.", "NTA. Rather than celebrating their child who survived they chose to continually mourn the child they lost, and in turn they basically lost their other child due to their inability to move on. Sorry OP.", "NTA - so NTA.\n\nI didn't mourn the death of a sibling of my mother as I had met him only infrequently. I was quiet and polite but you can't really mourn for someone who simply wasn't really in your life. A friend of my parents died around the same time and I was a bit upset at his death & felt guilty. My wise mother totally understood why I felt that way and didn't try to trauma dump on me by making me feel guilty for feeling that way.\n\nYou are your own complete person and have exactly the same needs as each of your other siblings. That your parents have chosen to treat you like a slightly less complete person (who needs less than your other surviving siblings??) because the sibling that shared your birthday tragically passed young has been a terrible choice they made.\n\nGo and don't feel guilty. I'm not sure there's a lot you can do to change *their* mind though. Until they can take a dispassionate look at how they're treating you and admit, to ***themselves***, they're being unfair, they will never listen to you explaining it. However much detail you go into. Sorry about that.............", "NTA your parents truly suck", "I'm a firm believer that grief (or the lack of) is between the griever and the person who passed. You have the right to grieve (or not) how it feel right to you, and express your feelings in a way that feel right to you. Nobody has the right to tell you how you should react, except the person who passed (but in this case she wasn't able to tell you anything). \n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
