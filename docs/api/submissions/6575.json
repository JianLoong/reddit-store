And talk with her about what special thing you could do to her room, so that she feels it's her space and knows you care about her comfort in it.", "Answering just your prompt, YTA for that choice of words. Just say there\u2019s two of them sharing the space so they get the bigger room\u2014how hard is that? No need to wade into the tricky territory of near adulthood", "While I agree with the decision to give TWO siblings the biggest room to share, YTA for how you explained your decision to your daughter. She will carry that with her always.", "Honestly if the space is that big and you have 3 other rooms? Everyone gets their own room and turn that into a gaming/movie/hangout space. No room, no argument lol and the twins can develop their own space as their own people. But kinda Y T A for your phrasing to your daughter", "Delivery makes YTA, you could have worded it way better if you really wanted the twins on the third floor. Oldest is prolly devastated after you worded it like the twins are more important than her.  Also there's three other rooms and 3 kids. Why not just cut the problem and say no one gets the attic. Everyone gets a regular room, twins can take turns having sleep overs in each other's room and make a big playroom or family movie room in the third floor?", "Soft YTA. While your reasoning is sound, telling your daughter \"You are not the priority\" was very, very poor wording choice. It's carelessly-said things like this that cause daughter to not tell you when she gets engaged, and when you ask why, hurt, she throws back in your face, \"You're not the priority.\"", "Both YTA AND NTA. Your reasons for giving the boys the attic makes sense as it\u2019s bigger and they want to share a room. In the future you can divide it if they don\u2019t want to share anymore. The way you explained to your daughter why she can\u2019t have the room was awful. She probably feels undervalued compared to her brothers. All of your children should be equal priorities, leave the favouritism to the grandparents/aunts/uncles. \n\nAnother comment said your daughter could\u2019ve also had that room until she moves, which is also a good idea to consider, unless it\u2019s too late now.", "So aside from the master bedroom and the attic, there are three other bedrooms? Why does the attic even need to be a bedroom then? It could have just been a rec room/second living room and each kid would get their own bedroom. And if the twins really wanted to share a room, they could still do that and have the 3rd bedroom as a bonus room just for the two of them. \n\nThat said, I understand your reasoning for your decision, though as others already said, your wording was hurtful. \n\nOne possible solution: If your daughter is upset about the size of her bedroom, maybe you could let her have some use of one of the extra bedrooms (kind of like her own little living room)?", "I have a great solution- each of the kids gets a bedroom and the attic gets made into a rec space that isn't a bedroom.

I would be sure to sit down and talk it through, choose some new wording, and reinforce that none of your children are a priority over the others. Like if it was anything else in the world it wouldn't be that she's not a priority to you and that is not what you intended to portray with your statement. \n\nOtherwise no one is TA here.

You're right about having a place for your younger children to grow into. I wonder what would be the harm in allowing your daughter to have the bigger space until she leaves for school and then moving her brothers in after she leaves. I realize that is more work moving things back and forth. But it might be worth it to her.", "YTA for the choice of language. Your points are valid - two people who will be in the space longer - but telling her she's less of a priority is cruel. \"It makes more sense\" for the reasons above is fine, but you've just told her she's less important than her brothers.", "YTA, not for giving the twins the larger bedroom, but for actually telling your child that her siblings were the \u201cpriority\u201d.

She will never have the bond your twins have. While that\u2019s something I, as an adult, have accepted with my own brothers and am okay with, she, as a 17 year old, may not have reached that understanding with hers.

If she's ready to get out into the wide world, she needs to put on her big girl pants and learn that.", "I understood just fine. And that's just an assumption.", "Hahahahaha!  Yeah, seriously.  I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve told both my kids that they weren\u2019t \u201cthe priority\u201d in a given moment.  Shockingly it doesn\u2019t seem to have caused them mental harm\u2026", "A pot isn't the same as a child you know.\n\n\nSaying you are prioritizing a pot of food is not weird.\n\n\nBut if you ignored or told your kid to stop talking because you are prioritizing their sibling. Then it is clear favouritism. \n\n\nI would hope a parents like yourself could see the obvious difference.", "Damn, you will never be at your kids wedding, you\u2019ll never see their kids, hell I bet they are on Reddit right now bad mouthing you about how they\u2019ll never forget this traumatic event.", "It\u2019s really not that loaded a statement in the context of the conversation.  My point is that I\u2019m pretty sure that the average 17yr old, who can handle aaaaalllll those other things, can probably handle a conversation about a bedroom.", "he never specified that is about only the rooms wen he said their brother's are a priority, but Ok, i mean we know terrible fathers exists. As i said,  people add info when they feel it.", "It really is . 17year olds having access to those things, and how they \"handle\" them is a total other conversion.. and news flash, quite a lot of them DON'T handle it very well!.\n\nYou are also talking about context whilst ignoring the context that this is a 17 yr old thinking about moving away from home for the first time, and being told by her dad that already makes her less of a priority before she's even gone.", "Even if he didn't. Please go fully understand the meaning of priority. There's a reason he didn't say not as important. \n\nHe prefaced saying it with you will always always always have a place here. I FELT that. He's clearly had to deal with sensitive people never understanding where he's coming from. I can't tell you how many times I've have to preface saying something with, this is gonna sound fucked up, because I know they're sensitive or they don't fully understand certain words.", "> a) she doesn\u2019t automatically get first pick because she\u2019s older \nb) she\u2019s moving away to university in the summer and it makes no sense to keep a nice and big space like that empty for most of the year. \n\n\n> When that didn\u2019t convince her I told her that while she\u2019ll always, always, always have a place under our roof the fact remained that she has another 6 months of living here full time whereas her brothers have another 9 years, so they were the priority. \n\nDid you read the full post?", "It makes her less of a priority WHEN CHOOSING ROOMS, which was what the conversation was about!  If she couldn\u2019t glean context then she shouldn\u2019t be going to college at all.  Good grief.", "That\u2019s exactly why they feel this way, I bet they were the older sibling and got the benefits.", "They only read the title. Context only matters when they don't have enough information to crucify you based on the title."]}
