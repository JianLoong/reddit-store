And talk with her about what special thing you could do to her room, so that she feels it's her space and knows you care about her comfort in it.", "Answering just your prompt, YTA for that choice of words. Just say there\u2019s two of them sharing the space so they get the bigger room\u2014how hard is that? No need to wade into the tricky territory of near adulthood", "While I agree with the decision to give TWO siblings the biggest room to share, YTA for how you explained your decision to your daughter. She will carry that with her always.", "Honestly if the space is that big and you have 3 other rooms? Everyone gets their own room and turn that into a gaming/movie/hangout space. No room, no argument lol and the twins can develop their own space as their own people. But kinda Y T A for your phrasing to your daughter", "Delivery makes YTA, you could have worded it way better if you really wanted the twins on the third floor. Oldest is prolly devastated after you worded it like the twins are more important than her.  Also there's three other rooms and 3 kids. Why not just cut the problem and say no one gets the attic. Everyone gets a regular room, twins can take turns having sleep overs in each other's room and make a big playroom or family movie room in the third floor?", "Soft YTA. While your reasoning is sound, telling your daughter \"You are not the priority\" was very, very poor wording choice. It's carelessly-said things like this that cause daughter to not tell you when she gets engaged, and when you ask why, hurt, she throws back in your face, \"You're not the priority.\"", "Both YTA AND NTA. Your reasons for giving the boys the attic makes sense as it\u2019s bigger and they want to share a room. In the future you can divide it if they don\u2019t want to share anymore. The way you explained to your daughter why she can\u2019t have the room was awful. She probably feels undervalued compared to her brothers. All of your children should be equal priorities, leave the favouritism to the grandparents/aunts/uncles. \n\nAnother comment said your daughter could\u2019ve also had that room until she moves, which is also a good idea to consider, unless it\u2019s too late now.", "So aside from the master bedroom and the attic, there are three other bedrooms? Why does the attic even need to be a bedroom then? It could have just been a rec room/second living room and each kid would get their own bedroom. And if the twins really wanted to share a room, they could still do that and have the 3rd bedroom as a bonus room just for the two of them. \n\nThat said, I understand your reasoning for your decision, though as others already said, your wording was hurtful. \n\nOne possible solution: If your daughter is upset about the size of her bedroom, maybe you could let her have some use of one of the extra bedrooms (kind of like her own little living room)?", "I have a great solution- each of the kids gets a bedroom and the attic gets made into a rec space that isn't a bedroom.

Never tell one of your children that another has \"priority.\" It's an admission that you rank your children and their needs in importance. \"No, because you're going away to college in a few months and we don't want to move things around twice\" would have sufficed.", "YTA for telling your daughter she isn\u2019t a priority.

She probably thinks you're counting down the days until she moved out now.", "The wording was poor, as a teenager isn't going to hear that her having the nicest room when she's moving out is not the priority, she will hear that she herself isn't a priority. I would be sure to sit down and talk it through, choose some new wording, and reinforce that none of your children are a priority over the others. Like if it was anything else in the world it wouldn't be that she's not a priority to you and that is not what you intended to portray with your statement. \n\nOtherwise no one is TA here.

You're right about having a place for your younger children to grow into. I wonder what would be the harm in allowing your daughter to have the bigger space until she leaves for school and then moving her brothers in after she leaves. I realize that is more work moving things back and forth. But it might be worth it to her.", "YTA for the choice of language. Your points are valid - two people who will be in the space longer - but telling her she's less of a priority is cruel. \"It makes more sense\" for the reasons above is fine, but you've just told her she's less important than her brothers.", "YTA, not for giving the twins the larger bedroom, but for actually telling your child that her siblings were the \u201cpriority\u201d.

My brothers are twins and I am the \u201cother\u201d kid (they\u2019re considerably older, though). \n\nWhile I sort of understand where you\u2019re coming from with giving them the larger space (although with 3 additional bedrooms I\u2019m unclear on why they couldn\u2019t each have a bedroom), your word choice of them being the \u201cpriority\u201d brings you over into AH territory. \n\nYour daughter is already the outsider here. She will never have the bond your twins have. While that\u2019s something I, as an adult, have accepted with my own brothers and am okay with, she, as a 17 year old, may not have reached that understanding with hers.

You NEVER, EVER, tell your child that they aren't as big a priority as a sibling.  Yep, YTA.\n\nQuestion:  What would be the big deal to allow her to have that space until she goes away to school?  It would be understood as a temporary situation and the boys will take over the space when she packs for school.\n\n\\*edit\\*  I just reread something else that you wrote.

It\u2019s hurtful. \nYour reasoning is fair, but I can\u2019t help feeling this is an unnecessary conflict.

Yikes.\n\nYTA for how you expressed this to her. Hope you weren't planning on having a relationship with her once she's an adult!", "YTA. Not for denying her the room, but for how you\u2019re addressing this.

Their the AH for saying their daughter is less of a priority than their sons.", "I\u2019m thinking she still wants the big room when she comes home for breaks.", "And when she comes home for the holidays, she doesn\u2019t get to sleep in the room she knows as her bedroom? Kicking the can down the road is going to make it worse.", "This doesn't matter bro", "Why when they could literally have bedrooms to themselves?", "Telling their daughter that she\u2019s less of a priority than their other children is what makes them an AH.", "Sorry, but... how would that be practical? All the decorations, furniture etc? Painting the walls, creating a personal safe space, isn't something you want to change or rearrange that fast. Maybe they need / want to buy new desks, beds, and closets and need them fitting to the size given.", "Exactly my thought.", "So just because she's a girl she should get the ensuite? Really?", "Why?", "I agree with this. Everyone I know, including my family, allowed the eldest to pick their room first.", "What bullshit, how does it make more sense to favour any of them. There's 2 twins, 1 daughter and the daughter is moving out in 6 months. It's not about favouring or prioritising, it's common sense!", "Why should the eldest automatically get first pick? There's absolutely 0 logic in that. \u201cOh you happened to be the first cum goblin to crawl out so you get to be the favorite all the time!\u201d It's a stupid thing that's been perpetuated for so long that people just say, \u201cWell that's the way it goes,\u201d without ever questioning why. \n\nOn top of that why would she get an enormous space when she's not even going to be living there in 6 months? If they decide to move the other two in there later that then becomes far more of a hassle than just moving them in there in the first place. Plus you don't know just how much of a hassle it might be for OP to do that. They may be disabled in some way and unable to move it all themselves. They'd need to hire movers to move large furniture like bedroom sets or get additional help from family to get it done.\n\nOn top of that, the other two aren't ready to move into separate rooms yet, and the larger space is far more suited to two people instead of one person. She can deal with picking one of the other 3 bedrooms available.", "He Noted she could choose from the other three rooms. So they have enough rooms", "Um\u2026 there\u2019s two of them sharing a room?  For at least 9 years\u2026.  I\u2019m not sure it could be any clearer.", "Ahhh I mean, she\u2019s a teenager. Theyre gonna push. The response isn\u2019t to keep changing explanations or using increasingly harsh words that are ripe for a poor interpretation. \n\nJust repeat that they need the bigger room and that\u2019s it.", "Agreed.  If it were me, I would have given her the choice of having a smaller room to herself or sharing with one of the twins in the attic with the explanation that the larger room has to be the shared room.  No 17 year old wants to share a room, so now she's in the smaller room and it was her decision!", "I was thinking this and also wondering if the kids all have the same two parents. Who is in a position where they have to explain to one of their kids that there will always be a place for them at home? It doesn't go without saying?", "Thanks! I fixed it", "It\u2019s literally the title", "Also, OP doesn't say anything about the bathroom situation besides the fact that the attic has one that's en suite. She could very well have her own bathroom. I'm assuming that a house with 4 bedrooms (including a master that likely has it's own en suite) has another bathroom that would likely wind up being the daughters alone. It's just not attached to the bedroom.", "If his daughter wants to take a straight-forward piece of logic out of context, that\u2019s her choice.  His statement made perfect sense.  She is simply not the priority as it pertains to bedroom preference.", "She\u2019s literally almost a decade older than them. She deserves the space and privacy. There are THREE other rooms the younger children could have, and yet he chose to give them the room his daughter wanted.", "Oh but I think it does. In blended families you have to be extra mindful of slights and perceived slights. If these kids have always been siblings and there's just an age gap, this is a tough situation and the parents handled it badly. If the younger children are the product of a new relationship and the older sibling is moving out, leaving the \"new family\" in the upgraded house where she will feel like a guest when she visits, that's a special kind of thoughtless, shitty parenting.", "Oh it does", "They don\u2019t want bedrooms to themselves though", "Did you read the story right? They are children and are not comfortable sleeping separately.", "Then she\u2019d be back here with AITA for moving my daughter out of her room after she left for college to give it to her brothers?\n\nNTA. The daughter needs roll with it. The decision was about what\u2019s best overall. Life comes with disappointment. Better she start learning that now.", "because she's the oldest", "Ever ask yourself why? Cause it's a stupid rule and it should be questioned.", "I agree, it's common sense to let the oldest have first dibs", "because she's the oldest", "Yeah, there were a million options for how to handle this and he chose the absolute worst.", "That the kids also wanted? There are 3 other rooms SHE could of chose from. your entire argument could be said for the daughter as well. The 3 other rooms she could of chosen had space and privacy just not as much space.", ">She\u2019s literally almost a decade older than them.\n\nSo? Again being older does not mean her preferences matter more than the preferences of her siblings.\n\nHe gave the TWO of them the largest room to *share*.\n\nThere are literally THREE other rooms for her to choose from to have all by herself.\n\nOP didn't give the twins that room *because* the daughter wanted it. They assigned that room because it was the most suitable for a pair of siblings to share, and because as a massive part of the house it would be ridiculous for the daughter to keep it when she doesn't even live there anymore.", "So true", "Idk bro, in my mind it doesn't really matter but is your opinion", "Well they have three other rooms to share until big sister moves out", "So they can choose one of the 3 other rooms to share until their big sister leaves home for uni. \n\nIt's clear they bought this house with the attic in mind for their precious sons. Eldest daughters get the short end of the stick every time with bigger restrictions and overprotective parents, whereas the younger sons get far more freedom. \n\nWhy can't she move into and enjoy the attic until she leaves for uni? So great for summer sleepovers before all her friends head off to different universities.  Then she could move her stuff into another room and set it up for herself when she comes visiting.", "So?", "That. Doesn't. Matter.", "I don't think you understand that 2 people sharing a room demand more space, so its logical that the twins stays with the biggest room, the oldest daughter don't need a bigger room just because shes older", "that's how it works", "Not in my house. We drew straws.\n\nOlder siblings do not matter more than younger siblings. This is a family not a company. You don't get seniority just because you happened to be born first.", "you should, the more mature person gets to make the first decision. I'm sorry you had a bad upbringing.", "Ah yes... the very mature decision of choosing the best for yourself.\n\nI am sorry you were raised to think that younger people matter less. I hope you didn't have any younger siblings.", "you should always choose for yourself, no one else is going to have you as their top priority."]}
