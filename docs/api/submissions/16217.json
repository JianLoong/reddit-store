Over some wine, friend's wife said to me, \"You know, I would be more suited for your husband and you for mine.\" On return from the beach, my husband is at the house with her husband and she walks up, kisses my husband on the mouth and gives him a lengthy hug. At our friends' weekend parties, she corners my husband, asking for his help on this or that. Months later, while we're entertaining at our house, she walks into our kitchen, saying, \"What I could do with a kitchen like this - I would've made so much more.\" Getting a bit tipsy, we go downstairs to watch my girls do a dance performance, and she yells out, \"Where's my \\[insert my husband's name\\]?\" Again, she kisses him on the mouth as she leaves for the night. \n\nWith just her husband and mine left at the party, I said, \"Listen, some of your wife's behavior is making us feel uncomfortable.\" He got defensive, saying she kisses everyone on the mouth, and my husband just kind of sat there. Ugh. Later, husband's friend says to my husband that we shouldn't get together. In other words, husband's friend blacklisted us from all future events. \n\nFive years pass, and now husband's friend is inviting us to events again. No surprise, wife is still crossing boundaries. She walks right up to my husband and kisses him, asks him to carry things for her, tries anything to get my husband's attention. My husband generally ignores her, but it's really uncomfortable. Others notice. She shouts out at the ball park, \"Where's my golf partner / strong man / my  \\[insert my husband's name\\]?\" (she doesn't play golf)  \n\n\nHusband asked that we go to her surprise 60th party. We went. Husband asked that we go to his friend's 60th - we went. We've tried to navigate these events while ignoring her, and my husband wants to see his friend, but any events that she's at creates complete chaos in our relationship. Last night, husband's friend asked him if he wanted to go to a showcase for the high school seniors' softball team, and I said I will not go with the wife there (I knew she'd be there), and I really didn't want him going solo, either.

She\u2019s being inappropriate and not once does it seem like he\u2019s said anything to her. Why does he just let her kiss him and let that moment go unchecked? Why isn\u2019t he snapping at her asking who she thinks she is? Why isn\u2019t he holding your feelings in higher regard?\n\nShe\u2019s completely in the wrong, that\u2019s for sure. I wouldn\u2019t trust her alone with him. I know it takes two to tango but as long as your husband doesn\u2019t say something or try to put distance between him and her that wouldn\u2019t reassure me.", "Seems like your husband might be the problem.", "NTA but your husband needs to be the one to put a stop to this. He needs to put his foot down and tell her she\u2019s acting inappropriate and needs to stop. \n\nIn other words, you have more of a husband problem here than anything else.", "NTA but the issue is your husband. He can\u2019t control what she says but he can control his reactions and own body language. Why the heck isn\u2019t he telling her to get lost?", "NTA. But your husband could have at least stopped some of the physical stuff. He doesn't have control over the bullshit coming out of his friend's wife's mouth but he could keep his distance from her.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s concerning that your husband doesn\u2019t know how to enforce his boundaries", "NTA. \nIf she kisses everyone like this she can go and kiss some dog shit. So many shit excuses disgusting. \n. \nAnd wth is wrong with your SO? it's not difficult to enforce some boundaries which could've been set the first time that woman did something like this!!", "Wth.... why isnt the friend saying anything to his wife... husband need to tell his friend to talk to her... disrespectful and kissing him in the mouth wow...", "NTA- you do not fuck with another married couples boundaries. Period. You husband should be shutting this shit down. If a woman disrespected me and our marriage like that in front of me I\u2019d probably snap. That is one serious line with me, and you have every right to feel the way you do.", "NTA. You say you said something to the friend, but has anyone walked up to her, looked her in the face, and told her to knock that shit off? Because someone should, and it should be your husband. \n\nDon't leave him alone with her, it will only encourage her further.", "NTA but her, her husband and your husband is the problem. First she shouldn\u2019t be kissing your husband on the mouth or anywhere. Secondly, her husband stating that she kisses anyone and just lets it happen? That\u2019s weird and your husband doesn\u2019t say or do anything about it? Sounds like all 3 of them are in a relationship and you\u2019re a side piece or something and it sounds like it won\u2019t end unless you snap at her because you should\u2019ve said something from day 1 and your husband should\u2019ve said something too.", "NTA - WHy is the world did you stay with a husband who clearly has no issue with this and does not set a clear boundary with this woman and her husband? Also, why is the world is her husband ok with this? My only answer is that they have an open relationship. Then I want to ask, has your husband ben involved with them like that, because it's literally the only answer I can see.", "NTA, her behavior would be off-putting to me as well.", "NTA - good manners cost nothing. She knows what she's doing is inappropriate.", "Info: seems like your husband doesn't have an issue with it, right? Would he be okay if you kissed his friend? What was his opinion about the kisses?", "NTA but your problem isn't the wife, the problem is your husband. All he has to do is tell her to stop. He must enjoy it to let it go on for years even though it's caused marital issues.", "NTA. This is absolutely a kink this couple has. It sounds like a cuckold situation.\n\nIt\u2019s curious that your husband still wants to be around the wife and seems to do nothing to avoid her or stop her.", "NTA. How on Earth did you not snatch her up?  WHY isn't your husband actively rejecting these advances and telling her and her husband to back the F up? You are not an AH at all. You're a saint. How you kept it all together, I can't even fathom. I'm seething for you. Plus, what is the husband doing?  \"She does that to everyone.\" Is not an acceptable answer. You're absolutely right to stay away. I applaud you.", "NTA, but your husband is. If he did not like her flirting with him like this, he would put a stop to it with a cold glare and a seething comment. He's flattered by it.", "NTA\n\nYour  husband needs to put a stop to this and make it clear it's unacceptable behaviour.  \n\nMake sure he doesn't try to wimp out by saying it's because it makes you uncomfortable.", "NTA \n\nThe biggest one here is your husband who at no point said \u201cCarla, I\u2019m married, please don\u2019t speak to or touch me that way.\u201d", "Esh. you Because you are blaming  this woman for your husband's disrespect. He's the one who should have put a stop to it years ago. He obviously does not have a real problem with it. He knows you do yet he just accepts another woman fawning and slobbering on him. You're also the asshole for basically tattllng/ complaining to her husband instead of speaking to her ...or even better yet talking to YOUR husband about how to handle her. He is the one that doesn't respect your boundaries.\nYour husband is also an A H for not stopping it knowing that you are unhappy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA but you talked to the wrong husband about her.", "NTA but your husband is for not addressing this and making it known that this behavior needs to end immediately", "NTA but your husband is letting this happen without even pushing her away from him. He\u2019s a bit of an AH.", "NTA, but I think you REALLY need to have a chat with your husband about how her actions make him feel and why he doesn\u2019t try to stop her or make more of an effort to avoid her. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s his FAULT, because if the genders were reversed in this situation we would all clearly see that the friend\u2019s spouse is being a predatory creep, but I do think it\u2019s super weird that he doesn\u2019t even want to try to get some distance from her. Does this behavior truly not make him uncomfortable? And if so, why the hell not?", "Info: Why is your husband allowing this woman to kiss him on multiple occassions? Your husband is the asshole for not putting a stop to this. He could easily put his hands out and tell her to step away but he's choosing to let her kiss him and be affectionate.

You've been too nice by not addressing it there and then with her.", "NTA. You have a husband problem. Your husband and those friends are gaslighting you into thinking her behavior is acceptable. How do I know this? Because you're in Reddit asking if you're an AH for not wanting another woman kissing your husband (and him letting it happen). \n\nThis is a flashing red flag. Please don't let people use you as a doormat. Make a scene the next time that woman tries to go for your husband. Same with your husband for his lack of boundaries. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he's doing more behind your back. I mean, he's already getting kissed in front of you, so that's not a big leap. How can he ask you to trust *him? That's a ridiculous ask in this situation. You're not blind.\n\nTalk to your husband again, and show him this post. Tell him how much this behavior and his lack of boundaries hurt you. Hopefully, he creates boundaries and tells that woman off. If he doesn't, then you know for sure he doesn't care about you.", "Exactly this.\n\nShe is behaving badly but seems to be within the bounds she and her husband are comfortable with.\n\nIt's YOUR husband OP who isn't establishing any boundaries, it's HIM who needs to respect your marriage by pushing back and stopping \"Mrs What's Yours Is Mine\".\n\nEvery. Single. Time. \n\nNTA", "Fuck off with this victim blaming nonsense.", "Exactly. If his response to being kissed on the mouth wasn\u2019t \u201cwhat the fuck get away from me\u201d then there is a huge issue with how he is (or really isn\u2019t) dealing with this situation. He needs to loudly be rejecting her.", "Creepy.  If my friend's  husband walked up to me and kissed me on the mouth,  he'd never do it again.\n\nWhy does the husband let her do all this stuff?", "I have to agree here.  Your husband should be putting a stop to this kind of behavior, however, I think he doesn't because he likes his friend... on the other hand, it's just disrespectful to you.", "Nope - husband hasn't had any kind of relationship with them like that. Personally I think he just wants to keep things nice with his friend, but it's seriously disrespectful imo. On many levels. I hate feeling like the AH who can't just brush it off.", "He thinks this is 'just her nature,' though she isn't kissing anyone's else husbands. He would find it out of character if I started kissing other men (or rather, lack of character?).", "I hear you - my husband and I have had this conversation many times. His thinking is to ignore bad behavior. (he's very non-confrontational and says that he doesn't really like this woman but tolerates her as his friend's wife.) \n\nWhen she left, I thought it was an opportunity for us, my husband and me, to have a frank conversation with the friend, since that's the relationship he values. And, though I would've liked to have said something to her - not sure if you've ever had a conversation with someone who's hitting on your SO - that rarely goes well.", "Because he enjoys it", "It's disrespectful on your husbands part. He should know not to have any physical contact with this woman and to put his hands up and out when she comes near him.There is a clear way for him to stop her pursuits but you two just seem to be putting the blame soley on the other woman.", "I usually hold back but do you seriously believe that? I would be completely straightforward with him. This is a redflag for me. I would have following questions:\n\n\"If it's just her nature why are you the only one she kisses? Why is it in her nature just to kiss you?\"  \n\n\"If a male friend would be like this and would kiss me and say it's just his nature, you would be okay with it? Because it wasn't initiated by me.\"  \n\n\"Do you care even a bit how this makes me feel?\" \n\nThere are probably more questions but this were the first popping up in my head.", "What if other men kiss you. Would he be happy with that? \n\nSuggest to sit down with your hubby and make clear where your boundaries are and if he doesn't like that, you'll need to think what you wanna do.", "So your HUSBAND is doing what to stop this? If the answer is nothing then you're mad at the wrong person.", "Exactly. I absolutely do not believe it, and husband says I can trust \\*him\\* - but I don't think being polite, ignoring it, or 'letting it go' is cool. It makes it stressful and uncomfortable.", "In the end his actions are doing the opposite. You lose trust and hey, that's not surprising. I would lose trust too. Does he even realize this? That his actions have this effect, does he even care? Because if not then is this something you can ignore or will this be a deal breaker especially now that you're kinda back in contact? Does he now how serious you're about this? Does he know he's the only one being kissed? \n\nSorry for all these questions.. I just feel angry reading this. Can't imagine how you feel.", "No, you cannot trust him. He is \"letting it go\" because it doesn't actually bother him, maybe he loves it, who knows? He certainly has not let HER know otherwise\u2014while happily watching you suffer the natural embarrassment ANY woman would feel in your shoes for years."]}
