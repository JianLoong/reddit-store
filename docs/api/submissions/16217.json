What I don\u2019t quite understand though is why, after 5 years hiatus, he\u2019s willingly jumping back into the same circumstances.", "Not at all - but like I said, as unfortunate as it is, it became his (and our) problem. We encourage women to speak up; shouldn't it be the same with men?", "I think he would find his voice if it was his wife kissing other men on the mouth. \nOr he would just forbid her to attend...", "Oh I missed your \",shrug and laugh,\". I guess turning away from the kiss is too much to ask?\nWell as long as it is ok for your SO to kiss others on the mouth it is all well and good... between the two of you at least.\nOut of curiosity- where is the line drawn? Before or after the woman has her hands inside your pants?", "Thank you both for saying this - I don't see this situation as his fault, but like assault (and isn't this awful -), it became his (and our) problem. For men especially, I think it's hard to draw that strong line and instead say, \"NBD.\" That said, it isn't going away, and the way to stop the behavior is for \\*him\\* to say NO to her.\n\nI really appreciate everyone's answers here. Though I felt this was never getting resolved, I also hated feeling like I was keeping my husband away from events because of the wife's behavior. I now see it really isn't my job or her husband's job to create the boundaries that my husband needs to enforce for \\*our\\* relationship.", "She wasn't sexually assaulted, he squeezes everyone's ass, it's just locker room style things. And it's not like she told him no, she just kinda froze up. She's an adult and an adult of course would know to say No after the first time right? Maybe she likes the attention?", "He's being kissed on the mouth without permission, he doesn't like it, and he's never given any signs of wanting it to continue.  He did not seek it out during a five year hiatus.\n\nYes, he's being sexually assaulted.  In this world of 'affirmative consent,' you'd think that 'well, he didn't say no' wouldn't even cross somebody's mind.  But here we are.", "The same reasons many people don't try to get out of abusive relationships.", "We encourage women to speak up, yes, but we also understand that victims need help, encouragement and protection, not 'ugh.'\n\nI don't see anywhere in your submission where you talk to your husband, ask him how he feels about all this, and let him know that you're on his side.", "[OP Stated he is very non-confrontational](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135i842/aita_for_asking_my_husband_that_we_avoid_events/jiknw6x/).\n\nYour clearly projecting something onto him here and giving him no benefit of the doubt.\n\n> Or he would just forbid her to attend...\n\nAnd here your Kidding right? OP more or less forbid him to attend for 5 years and you accuse him of doing hypothetically the same?", "> Before or after the woman has her hands inside your pants?\n\nBoth are still SA. Counter question, where is the line drawn, were you would accept he is sexually harassed and stop blaming him for not shutting down the Harassment?", "That was the point I was trying to make. I'm glad you got it. All through your post, you say we don't like this,  then he lets it happen. We were avoiding her,  but he asked to go to her surprise party. I'm getting mixed signals from your husband on what his intentions and his boundaries are,  but they seem much smaller than yours.", "Her husband and op forced the hiatus, and the post is through Ops perspective. The woman's husband was clearly put off enough to enforce a 5 year hiatus and she had no intention of stopping based on later events in the post. The only person who we are speculating on is Ops husband, and he's the one that wanted to go to her party. He wanted to keep seeing her at events. In her post, op doesn't mention him trying to duck out of a kiss or try and go for a hug,  so yes, here we are.", "Bro what- on the last count alone you're wrong- it literally says in the post that the FRIEND stopped inviting them for 5 years because they tried to talk with him about his wife. Talk about projecting.\n\n\"With just her husband and mine left at the party, I said, \"Listen, some of your wife's behavior is making us feel uncomfortable.\" He got defensive, saying she kisses everyone on the mouth, and my husband just kind of sat there. Ugh. Later, husband's friend says to my husband that we shouldn't get together. In other words, husband's friend blacklisted us from all future events.\"\n\n\nShe literally stood up for him and yall are shitting on her for not understanding its SA, its giving incel vibes, yall are trying to \"gotcha\" her and disrespecting survivors of SA by using thir struggles to make a point.", "Maybe when he stops laughing?", "Thank you - it's because the friend orchestrated the surprise party. Husband was trying to stay friendly with the friend, though he knew it'd be a hard sell to me. It was, but we did go - and left pretty much after, \"Surprise!\"", "Yep, awkward laughing to overplay social insecurity isn't a thing.\n\n/s", "NTA! But why is your husband allowing this behavior and why are you singularly blaming the woman when your husband is clearly complicit! Had your husband spoke up and told this woman that he found her behavior disrespectful, it would have ended years ago! I get the feeling this woman is attractive and your husband seems to like her advances towards him! You might want to check your husband before you call out the friend\u2019s wife!", "NTA.\n\nWhen my husband and I first got together, he had a female coworker who flirted with him A LOT. He didn't even see it. I eventually asked him to stop going to lunch with her because I did see her intentions, and he believed me. He didn't brush me off or minimize my feelings. It's the only time I've ever done that with anyone, but that woman set off alarm bells for me. \n\nI feel like your husband is putting his friend above you, OP. If he does mind these advances, it's on him to either put his foot down or avoid these people.", "Show him this thread of what everyone thinks of his place in this \n\nNTA", "NTA but your husband needs to realize how much this is bothering you, and if it's bothering him too, he needs to speak up and set boundaries with her.  \n\nOr just stop hanging out with these awful people.  Your husband may lose a friend, but it's a friend who is cool with his wife assaulting people and being disrespectful and rude to others, so...no big loss?", "INFO: Where's your husband in all this? He allowed this woman to kiss him on the mouth in public, twice that you've mentioned here. What does he do or say when she behaves this way. Why is it your problem to solve with her husband? Why does he want to keep spending time with this couple, knowing how uncomfortable it makes you. WHY AREN'T YOU TALKING TO HIM?", "Info: Have you asked your husband why he allows this and seems okay with it? You told friend his wife's behavior is making 'us' uncomfortable, but your husband just 'sat there'. DIdn't back you up, doesn't sound like ever reacted or said anything. You're the one uncomfortable. Is he? And if not, why?\n\nI'm not trying o suggest her behavior is appropriate. Genuinely asking.", "Why didn't you check this woman directly the first time she overstepped?", "Everyone involved is YTA.   Why is your husband letting another woman kiss him on the lips?   Other wife needs to stop.  Her husband needs to get a clue.  You for not setting boundaries sooner.  At this point, my husband, (who would never let this happen in the first place), would be hearing from, it is them if me.  I deserve better than I have been treated by all of you, but especially by you.  How would you like it if the friend was constantly doing those things to me?!", "NTA and lady, you have the patience of a saint. I would have broken my foot off in her ass like, a decade ago LOL", "NTA. but he seriously needs to respect your marriage and your feelings more and tell her to knock her crazy-lady shit off. \n\nHe needs to approach her to tell her to stop but say \u201cit makes US uncomfortable.\u201d Instead of \u201cit makes my wife uncomfortable.\u201d Because 1) she might not respect it just because he said it was only you and 2) because the latter almost implies that you are the problem/enemy and not her.", "He wants to go to events and not be cornered by the wife (kissed or otherwise asked for anything attention related). He is conflict avoidant and has a hard time saying no to friends who exploit that. Case in point, the friend in this story has thrown parties at his house before we met. It seems to me just an issue of creating and enforcing boundaries. Wife isn't kissing any of the other husbands, probably because they would say something to her.", "I've talked with him so many times over the years - he wants to keep the friendship with the friend and tells me that he doesn't like the wife, but tolerates her because it's his friend's wife. Makes the whole situation uncomfortable. But you're right - the buck stops when he says something to her, it won't change with me or her husband saying anything. I just tried to help.", "Pure shock. Like, WTF? At first it was cornering him to ask his advice on something, or to show off a new piece of jewelry she was wearing. I didn't think much of it. Then the suggestion to me that he would be a better husband for her. Then the kiss on the mouth - whoa.", "I strongly disagree! This is a major reach! As a woman I would never let me husbands friend kiss me on the lips or even the cheek for that matter!!! This is not a gender play bias type situation! It is simply the husband clearly is enjoying this behavior or at least is enjoying the attention! To call this SA is a major stretch. For example why didn\u2019t the husband say anything when his wife told his friend that the behavior was inappropriate. Because he likes it, clearly.", "So he rather keep the peace and friendship than keep you and your relationship. \n\nHe is prioritizing them over you and your relationship.", "It seems like your husband lacks character and likes her nature.\n\nShe is publicly and constantly hitting on him and being physical with him. \n\nHe rather keep this up and disrespect you and your relationship than say anything...", "Are these really your friends though? If they are continuously engaging in behavior you both deem unacceptable and affects your relationship directly in a negative way, they seem like pretty crappy friends.\n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of controlling other people\u2019s behavior no matter what, so I kind of think Y WBTA if you stopped him from going to any events she were attending. But I think that you should ask him to attend couples counseling to get to the bottom of this conflict avoidance issue and how it affects your relationship. He\u2019s really not avoiding conflict, he\u2019s just deflecting onto you. If he doesn\u2019t address this he would be TA.", ">  *it was her husband that blacklisted us for 5 years. He \"didn't want a scene*.\"\n\nPerhaps you should cause a scene, OP.  A big one.  It might be good for your blood pressure.\n\nBoth of these people sound impossible.  Why in the world would the husband think that it's OK for his wife to SA another man?  Does he enjoy watching?  Are they trying to recruit you and your husband as swingers?  \n\nNTA for being upset, but *do something*, OP.  Maybe therapy for you and your husband would help you both.", "Exactly! He has no problem disrespecting his wife. I would have left the event the first time he allowed the disrespect. I would have left him for good the second time. OP probably only goes to these events with him to ensure that he doesn't sleep with her. It is sad she still comes here to see if she is in the wrong for not allowing her husband and potential affair partner to disrespect her.", "It could be that the wife thinks he is uncomfortable. Because if he is so uncomfortable, why doesn\u2019t he address the issue to his friend about his friend\u2019s wife\u2019s behavior.", "Thank you - I had the same thought! Scene might do some good. :) Therapist years ago said husband should turn his head. Omg, therapy! I think husband saying something to her will be the most effective - embarrassment tends to stop things fairly quickly.", ">husband says I can trust *him* -\n\nSo did my ex and he was fucking my best friend.\n\nWords don't mean shit if you don't follow through.", "Here is some music to stream during your scene, classic Loretta Lynn.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_wwP8UZR1o\n\nLoop it, and make it loud.", "Maybe you should just tell her to lay off your husband if nothing else works.
