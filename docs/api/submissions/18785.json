That's not your fault, or your problem. \n\nIf she doesn't want people to respond, then she shouldn't be constantly baiting them. She's just angry because you flipped the power dynamic between you, and can't flip it back.", "NTA here. I would've mentioned that and brought up the fact that she ran up your fianc\u00e9's credit and ruined his credit score as well. Honestly you could've been way ruder, this was an apt and appropriate response to her earlier vitriol.", "NTA, if your fianc\u00e9 agrees with you, you're in the clear.\n\nAlso, what planet do you live on where 28/30 is \"too old\" to buy a house?  I want to go to there.", "I would limit time spent with MS Sour Grapes. Nothing you as a couple do will ever be right.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA. Nice and snappy. \n\nProbably gonna have to work on your fiance though- he's going to have to back waaaay out of her life. Sounds like everyone in her life including her ex husband have gotten used to tolerating her behavior.", " NTA. Well played.", "Nta & good for you", "NTA you fianc\u00e9's mom sounds a lot like my mom. My husband and I have been through a lot as a couple trying to get on our feet as a direct result of her having extreme financial control of me. My mother is lucky that my husband acknowledges her existence when she is in a room. Certainly, if a similar situation arose, he would have said the same. Of course, she thinks Y.T.A you called her out. \n\nCongratulations on the house!", "Lmao NTA yeah you should\u2019ve taken the higher road but sometimes people need to be put in their place", "NTA.

Or did fil pay for it", "This is a tough one (I, too, have a MIL who likes to overstep and insult to the point where we've been NC for years) but I'm going with ESH. \n\nMIL started it and deserves most of the blame, but you didn't have to take the bait and stoop to her level.\n\nIMO, the fianc\u00e9 also sucks a little bit here for not speaking up and managing his mother. You shouldn't be the one who has to say something.\n\nSide note: not to defend MIL, she does sound pretty awful, but if she is raising a 12yo child then that money she gets from your future FIL might be child support, which she would be legally entitled to.", "Gonna get downvoted but YTA. I don\u2019t think that was your place to say something unless she personally directed the comment just at you. She has done horrible things to your fianc\u00e9 and maybe affected your life with him but that\u2019s his parent. Not a good way to start a marriage.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
