You warned him not to date her and it doesn\u2019t sound like the girlfriend broke up with him in a rude way. \n\nBut I also think he is valid to feel like you\u2019re taking the side of his ex, even if he\u2019s over the heartbreak.

I get that there's some humor here with the teenage angst and everything. But there is room to discuss how his feelings are to a degree being diminished. They just broke up, he is really upset, and the setting is his home, where he should feel safest and most supported. You and Taylor don't have to bend over backwards for him, because yes this is a learning situation, but I am getting a lack of compassion from your side here.\n\nIt might be worth you or Taylor at least giving him a heads up when Anna's coming over so he can leave or go chill in his room and have some control over his own experience and boundaries in this particular case.", "YTA. Give him some space and tell your daughter to spend more time in her friend's house for a while.

You're the adult in this situation who is responsible for two children. Not the ex. Not wanting an ex who broke up with you in your house is extremely reasonable. The sister can see her friend elsewhere, he only has one house I assume and should be able to feel safe/comfortable there. \n\nYou might end up with a son who doesn't want to spend time with you  if you follow this path.", "Mother of five here.  In terms of a permanent ban, I really think it depends on what she did.  If she cheated on him or otherwise did him wrong, then both you and Taylor are TAs. Additionally, it is pretty fricking cruel to have her back in the house so soon after the break up regardless of circumstances.  Just because she is Taylor\u2019s bf does not give her carte blanche.  So at a minimum she should be temporarily disinvited until his wounded heart heals.  So yes, YTA.", "NTA.\n\nHe's 17.  He's going to be feeling the heartbreak with all the intensity of adolescence.

Now she is back she has immediately come over to the heart of his home and you are telling him to suck it up, get over it, and I told you so \n\nI think it's a bit heartless. I know you warned him it would get messy but he is 17 and inexperienced and you shouldn't use it to justify brushing over him being hurt.\n\nYour daughter and her friend could hang out at the friends for a bit, or at least in her bedroom, so he doesn't get an emotional slap in the face without due warning when he went to the kitchen.\n\nI think YTA for effectively telling him his feelings don't matter.", "NTA \n\nIt's a good lesson for the future...I e don't fish off the company pier.", "NTA - this is the natural consequence of dating your sister's best friend!

Tell your daughter to go hang out at her friends house for the time being, what your doing is showing to him either intentionally or unintentionally that you don't really care for his emotions and rather than trying to give him some time to himself in his own home, you'd rather play Sweden and be basically neutral or siding with his EX. No one wants to be near their EX, especially basically right after, yet you aren't showing any empathy because again, \"you warned him.\"", "NTA - he has no right to put you in the middle.  This was his doing and he needs to deal with it.  I dated a couple of my brother's friends, but I knew not to hold my brother responsible when things didn't work out and I was mature enough to stay friendly with them so things didn't get uncomfortable.

That's what happens when you date your sibling's bestie", "Depends on why they broke up. But yeah, you're being pretty unsupportive of your son who seems to have a broken heart. YTA for that. Ask them to go work in her room or something.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks that your son got dumped, but like you warned him beforehand, it wasn't a good idea for him to ask Anna out. Maybe this was a good lesson for your son to learn, to think before starting a relationship. Later in life he won't be able to get colleagues fired either just for dumping him. \n\nDid you tell him clearly what kind of messy it would be, if he chose to ask Anna out?", "NTA\n\nYou tried to warn him.", "NTA and this is prime example of why you don\u2019t date your siblings friend.  You warned him it would get messy.", "She was Taylor's friend first before she was Noah's girlfriend.

Welcome to the real world Noah, where you have to deal with people you don't like on a daily basis!", "NTA. Tell him at this age it won't take time to get over. He will also soon get over her. Meanwhile tell your daughter not to invite her friend for some time without letting her know. Just convince her to give some time to her brother.", "NTA.

Kid needs to grow out of it.", "NTA you warned him not to go there and he did. \n\nHe will get over it eventually.", "NTA.

Another great parenting moment.  Good for you.", "Omg this is the perfect place to pull out the worst case scenario of this ---- I dated a guy on and off through high school.

I think the issue is most of the top commenters are saying that and then saying \u201clmao get dunked on idiot, that\u2019s what you get for dating your sister\u2019s friend\u201d which I\u2019d argue lacks empathy.", "I wonder if the lesson being learnt here is that boys need to keep their emotions to themselves and they shouldn't get emotional about girIs. I'm a bit  saddened by the avalanche of unsympathetic commentary bearing in mind there is no hint of him having behaved badly.", "Just because it didn\u2019t work out or go as planned doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t hurt.  A little empathy goes a hell of a long way.", "Yeah, one of the few places you probably should be able to be a little entitled is your own fuckin house lmao.\n\nHe is 17. In a few months he will be over it. The refusal for any compromise or accommodation in the short time it will take him to get over it is the issue. \n\nLike how hard is it to say \u201cyeah we will let you know when she is here and you can make other plans so you don\u2019t accidentally run into her\u201d?\n\nOr \u201cif you are here, we will ask daughter to go to her friends house instead\u201d?\n\nLike\u2026 It really isn\u2019t that much of an ask. The refusal to care about the emotional needs of your own child isn\u2019t made acceptable just because \u201cI told you so\u201d", "Oookay\u2026.?  I was just agreeing with OP that this is a prime example of why you don\u2019t date your siblings friends.\n\nEdit-Also who\u2019s \u201cwe\u2019re\u201d because many others said what I did??", "Your comment confuses me honestly, i\u2018m not sure if you agree with me or mock me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Ugggggg the lesson is don\u2019t date people that will still be in your life after you break up.\n\nOP 100% shouldn\u2019t ban the girl since it would be punishing her daughter to ban her best friend. She just existing and doesn\u2019t seem like she is bothering him.", "Even my dogs know that ;-)", "I wonder how many of you pretend to be an empathetic person!!.", "Reddit doesn\u2019t like it when you point stuff out like that", "\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "My brother is two and a half years older than me, and there was a time or two when I thought he was interested in my friend(s). I remember thinking to myself \"He just better not hurt her\" (my brother and I were a little more distant as siblings in high school tend to be).\n\nI think in reality he was just outgoing/extrovert and I just didn't understand that as a quiet/introverted person. As an adult I can say I don't think he ever crushed on one of my friends.\n\nHe did date someone a year or two younger than me once (still in highschool). I thought that was weird as hell, and didn't really like it, but his dating interests don't align with my friend interests so it wasn't really an issue. They also didn't last but I'm not surprised XD\n\nOh and ETA: NTA OP. He'll grow up and it'll be fine.", "I understand the metaphor but usually the person being criticised is the one who did wrong....he seemingly hasn't. If the only people you could date had no connection to your family, friends or work most people would be single.", "Still wouldn't matter. It's her other kid's best friend and has been for years. People have to deal with seeing exes in life all the time. It will be a lesson learned for the son that just because a relationship with **you** is over, doesn't mean that their connections to anyone else you're connected to ends.", "I truly wouldn\u2019t. As someone who fucked up like this young man did, having to see my sisters best friend (I\u2019m gay) every day after school sucked but I got over it and I\u2019ve never made the same mistake. Still talk to my dad and mom lol", "Never said he wasn't, but like many others have said. He's still technically a child with a developing brain and emotions. While it may seem trivial to adults, in his first time with heartbreak, his mom didn't back him up, which he will remember. Plus, I don't disagree that he should feel comfortable in his home.", "Wait, shit, my bad I meant to reply to a different comment (a comment complaining that nobody thinks of the feelings of men/boys).  Have an upvote because I'm dumb.", "The daughter and the ex should hand out in friend's house for a while.\n\n\nOP's son needs time to heal and he needs a safe and comfortable space. Right now the family and ex with their actions and words deny him the healing he needs and deny him a safe and comfortable space.", "How did you teach them? Mine actively seek out shit to eat!", "Women: men are never sweet or soft with me!\n\nAlso women: men sHoWiNg eMoTiOns?!?! Nooooooooo!\n\n(I\u2019m a woman, and the hypocrisy is staggering).", "She\u2019s at his home all the time before they dated. She gets to continue to be at his home, because the sister wants her there. \n\nNeither of them had to do anything wrong, but before he dated her he had the information that she would be around if they broke up. It\u2019s a risk he took and it\u2019s his responsibility to mange the repercussions and his feelings.", "\u2728This \u2728", "Also, you can literally die from broken heart.\n\nPeople need healing after a break up most of the time. Right now the family and the friend/ex, make it harder for him to heal and harder for him to be in a safe space.", "All good lol", "He has a safe place in his room like most kids do. The ex isn\u2019t coming to bother him she was just working on hw ( I assume since OP said work)\n\n\nYou don\u2019t get to ban people from the home especially someone else guest since you broke up.", "But this isn\u2019t \u201cshowing emotions\u201d it\u2019s being a nasty jerk because a girl dared to end a relationship."]}
