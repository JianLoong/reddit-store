I get that there's some humor here with the teenage angst and everything. But there is room to discuss how his feelings are to a degree being diminished. They just broke up, he is really upset, and the setting is his home, where he should feel safest and most supported. You and Taylor don't have to bend over backwards for him, because yes this is a learning situation, but I am getting a lack of compassion from your side here.\n\nIt might be worth you or Taylor at least giving him a heads up when Anna's coming over so he can leave or go chill in his room and have some control over his own experience and boundaries in this particular case.", "YTA.

You're the adult in this situation who is responsible for two children. Not the ex. Not wanting an ex who broke up with you in your house is extremely reasonable. The sister can see her friend elsewhere, he only has one house I assume and should be able to feel safe/comfortable there. \n\nYou might end up with a son who doesn't want to spend time with you  if you follow this path.", "Mother of five here.  In terms of a permanent ban, I really think it depends on what she did.  If she cheated on him or otherwise did him wrong, then both you and Taylor are TAs. Additionally, it is pretty fricking cruel to have her back in the house so soon after the break up regardless of circumstances.  Just because she is Taylor\u2019s bf does not give her carte blanche.  So at a minimum she should be temporarily disinvited until his wounded heart heals.  So yes, YTA.", "NTA.\n\nHe's 17.  He's going to be feeling the heartbreak with all the intensity of adolescence.

Now she is back she has immediately come over to the heart of his home and you are telling him to suck it up, get over it, and I told you so \n\nI think it's a bit heartless. I know you warned him it would get messy but he is 17 and inexperienced and you shouldn't use it to justify brushing over him being hurt.\n\nYour daughter and her friend could hang out at the friends for a bit, or at least in her bedroom, so he doesn't get an emotional slap in the face without due warning when he went to the kitchen.\n\nI think YTA for effectively telling him his feelings don't matter.", "NTA \n\nIt's a good lesson for the future...I e don't fish off the company pier.", "NTA - this is the natural consequence of dating your sister's best friend!

Who in their right mind would want to see their ex casually at their kitchen counter hanging out like it\u2019s their house?  Anna is Taylor\u2019s friend, sure, but why didn\u2019t Taylor mention, \u201coh hey, not to surprise you, but she\u2019s coming over\u201d?   OP couldn\u2019t be bothered to say something?  Why couldn\u2019t the girls have worked in Taylor\u2019s bedroom?\n\nWhy does OP seem to have absolutely 0% empathy for her son?

Is it not Noah\u2019s house also?  Does he not have the right to feel at home and not be caught emotionally off guard in it?  OP seems way more interested in \u201cbeing right\u201d than in making sure her son responds to emotional upheaval in a heathy, calm way.\n\nIf this was Taylor\u2019s very first breakup, would OP tell her to just get over it?  Is she making sure to tell Taylor to never date Noah\u2019s friends?\n\n\nI can\u2019t tell if OP simply has Taylor designated as the Golden Child, or if she\u2019s just that bad of a parent all around.  \n\nBut 1000% YTA.", "NTA - Emotions are hard at his age.
