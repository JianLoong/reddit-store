Not for lack of trying on my part, but she's just been completely uninterested in getting to know me over the last ten years I've been with her son (30sM). She's made it clear that she doesn't actually want me at family holidays - she only started inviting me once my husband told her if I wasn't invited he wouldn't come. Now I get invited to every holiday, but each visit is a grueling test of endurance when it comes to my anxiety - even though MIL lets me in the house she makes it clear that I am unwanted and a burden the entire time.   \nLast year, my FIL was very ill for Thanksgiving, and my husband asked me if I would mind staying home by myself so his mother didn't have the 'additional stress' of my presence. I was a little hurt that he would ask, but given I knew his father's illness was terminal, I swallowed it down and told him to enjoy his time with his dad. And it was honestly the best Thanksgiving I'd had in years. No need to worry about family obligations, putting on a fake smile and pretending I don't hear his mother talking crap about me to relatives in the next room. I just got some comfort food for myself, cooked it, and played video games all day.\n\nMy FIL passed last January, and I've spent most of my emotional energy helping my husband grieve. My MIL specifically asked me not to attend the funeral as she didn't want to see a 'happy marriage' as a new widow, so I didn't go. I literally haven't seen any member of my husband's family save my husband himself since last Christmas - which was just as stressful as all the previous holidays. \n\nWell, Thanksgiving is this week, and my MIL invited both of us to go. My husband immediately accepted without consulting me, but when he mentioned it I told him I'd rather stay home by myself. He was fine with it, but told me he's still going to go since his mother invited me. I told him to have fun, but I was tired of putting on a performance when I'm obviously not wanted. \n\nMy husband was a little offended that I said that, and brought up that she's a new widow. I reiterated to him all the ways she's frozen me out over the last decade (too many to mention w/ character limit), not just after his father's passing, and that he told me she'd warm up to me when we got engaged (she didn't), then when we got married (she didn't). I told him I'm tired of pouring emotional energy into a one-sided relationship, and if I have my way, I'll spend Christmas at home, too.\n\nHe's still upset that I don't want to go, but stopped kicking up a fuss about it. Still, I care about him deeply, so I thought I'd double check by asking here.", "created_utc": 1669066558, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1b12z/aita_for_staying_home_by_myself_for_thanksgiving/", "score": 405, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why is his mom allowed to say that she can't handle the stress of you being there, but you are not allowed to say that you also can't handle the stress of being there? That is a wild double standard, even accounting for your FIL's illness and death. \n\nI just cannot get over the fact that she barred you from the funeral because she couldn't stand to see a happy marriage. Were there no other married people there? Also, did it not seem odd to people that you were not there supporting your husband? What on earth has she been telling people to explain your absence at these events?", "NTA personally I question his priorities when he's willing to leave his partner alone over the holidays to spend time with his mommy.", "NTA. If she's a new widow, wouldn't she still want to avoid \"the 'additional stress'\" of your presence and of seeing \"a 'happy marriage'?\"", "One million percent NTA. You deserve to enjoy Thanksgiving as much as anyone else and if MIL clearly doesn't enjoy your company then of course you have to put on a performance of pretending you're not having a horrible horrible time. That's the facts and your husband should have insisted his family be welcoming to you from the start as he has allowed things to get this bad.", "Nta, ask your husband if the roles were reversed could he had put up with it for that long?", "[removed]", "NTA. Wtf. She's made you feel unwelcome and unwanted in her home for a decade? Why would you want to go. Kinda messed up your husband was okay for you to spend Thanksgiving alone so his mom won't get stressed though.", "NTA. Take care of your mental health and enjoy your \"me\" day. Hopefully, the husband will enjoy the holiday with his hateful mother and eventually see how toxic she is. (New widow or not, she sounds like a huge AH).", "Nta on any level", "NTA - MIL sucks and your husband kind of sucks for not sticking up for you and seeing what she\u2019s clearly doing.", "NTA but I don't understand why your husband is okay with how MIL treats you. And why is he fine to spend holidays without you? That makes no sense to me.", "NTA, but he needs to intervene with his mother.  The fact that she told you not to attend the funeral is really telling.  You should have been there to support your husband, and she wouldn't allow this to happen.  I think he needs to get in her face and tell her to stop being such a B to you.\n\nIn the mean time, watch the parade and eat pie in your PJs all day. \ud83d\ude09 \ud83e\udd67 \ud83e\udd83", "NTA. Your husband is though. He's supporting someone who actively dislikes you.", "NTA. This is what you want.  This is what MIL wants. If she's allowed to uninvite you from family events, then you are surely allowed to uninvite yourself.\n\nThe only person who doesn't want this is your husband, because it forces him to reckon with a situation he created by not sticking up for you earlier in your relationship.  Well, that's his problem...", "NTA -  He may be upset that he cannot \"fix\" the relationship, but I feel he is not upset with you.  He likely wants the \"perfect\" holiday with family.  It is just not going to happen. It does bug me that he has not put a stop to her nasty behavior over the years. You were barred from the funeral now she wants you to attend things again?   She has gotten away with it for all these years, is it going to change?  You are happy for him to spend time with his family and enjoy spending the day doing what you want to do without any stress.   Enjoy your day.  Any chance you could get a \"headache\" at Christmas?  I am sure you have one just thinking about going.", "NTA. After 25 years of being in your position, I finally pulled the plug. My hubby can go. Kids are old enough to also choose. I'm done. I reminded hubby of all the shit his mom did to me, that he and kids can choose to see them, but I'm done. Last 2 years we had holidays just us (I've lost both parents and sister in the last few years). This year, hubby wants to spend Thanksgiving with his family. I'm fine with that but not going. My kids were worried about going and I assured them that, since their grandma doesn't treat them badly, I am ok with their going. They understand why I'm not.\n\nSo this week, it's me, my dogs, my sweatpants, and pie. I am really looking forward to it.", "NTA. You have put up with her disgusting rude behaviour for a decade?! But the worst part is that your husband is complicit and enables it. Why are you even married at this point. He does not support or respect you. Have self respect and end the misery", "NTA. So sorry you are going through this. It\u2019s such a shame that your husband allows this to happen. Do what you need to be happy. \n\nr/JustNoMIL\n\nGood luck to you.", "NTA, the expectations and stress of being where you aren't wanted makes holidays really not worth it.  Enjoy staying home!  Hub can go hang with his family, without having to manage your anxiety and stress while juggling time with them.  It's as much a favor to him as it is a stress reducer for you.  Win/win.", "I think your husband is more the asshole. He needs to tell his mom that she needs to respect you as well as invite you. If she can't be civil, he should say he isn't coming. She sounds like a real peach and I don't blame you for not wanting to go. It will make both you and MIL happy so it's a win win.", "NTA. Your MIL is the AH for excluding you from the funeral when your husband could have benefited from you being there for support. Also, were there any other couples at the funeral? It sounds like she made up that excuse to not want to see a \u201chappy couple\u201d just so you wouldn\u2019t come. She had also made it known that she considers you as \u201cstress\u201d and who would want to be around someone who thinks of you like that. \nThe MIL definitely needs a talk from her son about the way she treats you. \n\nHowever, this is going to be the first Thanksgiving your husband spends without his dad, and if you\u2019re up for it I think it would be a nice gesture to be with him, despite the AH being there. \ud83e\udd0d\n\nEither way, NTA.", "NTA.  Your husband clearly decided that he \"fixed it\" when he put his foot down and insisted that you should be invited and is refusing to acknowledge his mother's ongoing treatment of you because he doesn't want to have to actually stand up to her for real.\n\nThis doesn't feel very sustainable in the long term.  She probably still won't warm up to you if you have children, but you'll have more obligations to see her. I'm guessing you haven't asked him to pick a side because the writing's on the wall that he wouldn't pick you.\n\nAs far as family optics go, \"I didn't go because my MIL openly hates me\" isn't actually worse than \"I went, but I had a miserable time because my MIL openly hates me.\"  At least this way you can pretend you had other plans. Is your own family still in the picture?", "NTA. But your husband sure is an AH. \n\nLike he knows you are mistreated by your MIL and how she talks about you, etc. why are you still married to him? He clearly is an AH. Think TWICE before having children with this man. Those poor kids who will be subjected to witness the toxicity of your husband and his mother, eww.", "NTA - Sounds like the MIL is only thinking of herself. The holidays are about being with your family, chosen, loved or hated. I wouldn't want to be around people that didn't want me to be around them. Not sure why she is so against you, but it sounds like a rock and a hard place your husband is in also. Having to please two women in his life, one that's too picky and demanding (MIL) and the other who wants to please but is constantly being mistreated and made to feel like a burden. I hope it works out somehow, someway, thinking of you!", "NTA\n\nAlso does he not realize how lucky he is that you have come up with the extremely selfless solution of staying home alone during your holiday and you're able to enjoy yourself just fine?", "NTA.  You don't mention if your family or parents are still in the picture so I can't say if you should be trying to spend time with them instead.  Since it's the 1st year since FIL passed away, I'd give your husband a pass this year.  Next year, different story.  It's time for you and hubby to start building your own holiday traditions.  Both of you need to stay home and don't invite MIL to visit.  She is beyond openly hostile to you - at least he stood up for you (sort of).  He needs to stand up for you again.", "Nta. Do you have scissors for the umbilical cord on those two?", "NTA- you don't have to spend time with people you don't want to just because they're family", "NTA, why are you with someone who puts his mother ahead of his wife?", "Nta but your husband sucks like his mom", "NTA\n\nIn addition to JustNoMIL I recommend/r/JustNoSO\n\n\nYou don't have a supportive husband.  I empathize with his mother losing her husband but your husband didn't fight for you when you were engaged or when the marriage occurred.  He didn't prioritize you in front of his mother, and she knows this, and has been able to ice you out for years. That's despicable.", "ESH. Your MIL for the vicious way she\u2019s treated you. And your husband. Come on! You have two sad options. To submit yourself to more of your MIL\u2019s abuse or to spend the holidays alone. What kind of a husband leaves his wife with those two options???", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur husband is an AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nget a divorce.", "NAH, at least as far as any conflict between you and your husband. (Your MIL is a different story.)\n\nYou don\u2019t have the spoons for anymore holidays with someone who doesn\u2019t like you. He probably really would like to spend his holidays with everyone he loves, and is upset that he won\u2019t be able to do if you don\u2019t go. But it doesn\u2019t sound he\u2019s done anything especially asshole-ish to try to make you go.
