She lost her job cuz of the pandemic and given that we were stuck at home, most of the time, we decided that it was better for us to fire our housekeeper and have her be a stay at home mom at least until the kids (6f, 4m, 1m) were a little older. \n\nAnd its mostly been fine. We split chores about 40% me/ 60% her. She does most of the household work during the day, and I take over when I get home. Except on weekends, when we either work together or one of us relaxes. \n\nThe thing is, I gave her free reign on the monthly financials of the household. Our thought process was, she spends most of the time buying things for the family, she'd know best what to buy, how, when. And it would be a waste of time to discuss every purchase or financial decision. \n\nAnd that was fine as well. Until about 4 months ago when I noticed some discrepancies. I began noticing a bunch of 49.99$ or 99.99$ purchases. Initially I didn't pay them any mind, but over time there were more and more. So eventually I did a little digging, i checked who the purchases where made to, tracked how often. Looked at what my wife does in her free time.\n\nLong story short over the span of just the last 2 months she spent \\~10k dollars on gatcha games. \n\nLook, I'm not ridiculous, I understand people have hobbies that can require expensive purchases. I myslef spend maybe 200$ on video games every month. But 10k... in 2 months... on gatcha games, games specifically designed too keep you paying and paying. I consider it a real problem.\n\nSo I confronted her. I told her that I'm not giving her a blank check anymore, not unless she seeks professional help. I told her that I called our old housekeeper and she'll start working with us again this month to help her with the kids. \n\nShe said that its not that big of a deal because we can afford it. \n\nI told her yes, we can afford it, for now. But its a dangerous game she's playing and she needs help. I told her the housekeeper will have to approve the financial decisions in the household together with her. \n\nThen she called me an asshole and that I'm financially controlling her because I'm only source of income in the household.

I would talk to the bank or payment provider and block any payments relating to mugger app game companies but I really am an asshole.\n\nMaybe she should get a job then you can afford childcare and she can spend her own money on her addiction.\n\nNTA\n\nThis is an absurd analogy but if she'd been spending $5k per month on a cocaine habit while caring for the children, would that be better or worse?", "**NTA**   Your wife has a problem, one that could potentially create big problems for your family.   Do you know if she was doing that with the money she earned before?\n\nPersonally, I think she should go back to work to pay off her gaming additction -- without a housekeeper.    Given that you've already rehired the housekeeper, you should still expect better accountability.  Starting with paying the housekeeper's salary with her earnings.\n\nI don't agree with giving the housekeeper authority over your wife when it comes to the budget though.   You just did an audit of your expenses, set a budget and fund it with a debit card.   If your wife wants something out of budget, that can be discussed when it happens.   What you don't want is for her to run out of money mid-month because she is secretly gaming again.", "NTA  wrt cutting off the blank check-your wife has an addiction and needs help.\n\n# HOWEVER, \n\nFoisting the financial oversight onto the housekeeper is a real dick move.  It's not her job to say no to your wife, it's yours.  I hope you're prepared to be a little more involved in helping your wife get professional help, and attending some joint sessions with her.", "NTA, $10K is excessive and she does have an issue, she might not be all that happy staying a home.  So you do need to talk to her and find the root cause of why she did it, I'll bet she didn't even realize it had gotten to that extent.", "NTA she has an addiction and needs professional help", "> I told her the housekeeper will have to approve the financial decisions in the household together with her.\n\nI'm on board with this post overall but you cannot put this on your housekeeper. She cleans houses. It's not her job to be a financial babysitter for your wife's app store addictions and you are putting her in a terrible position by expecting this of her. It sets up an innocent worker to bear the brunt of your wife's abuse and vitriol when you're not around.\n\nESH, just because this housekeeper thing is insane.", "NTA. I have spent money on games, but that is not just spending a little, that sounds like the early stages of an addiction. I can\u2019t fault you after ten grand in two months.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't about being financially controlling, this is about the fact that your wife has developed an addiction, and you're right, if she doesn't acknowledge and address it, your family could lose EVERYTHING.\n\nHer argument that \"you can afford it\" is honestly terrifying. She spent $10k in two months on basically nothing at all. Nothing. It's not even gambling in the sense that she could have won something. She just spent it on digital nothingness. And if she keeps it up at that pace, you're NOT going to be able to afford it . . . you could lose your house, your savings . . . you could end up in the kind of debt you can't dig your way out of.\n\nYour wife has an addiction, most likely due to depression from losing her job and a DRASTIC life change. She needs therapy, and yeah, as long as she can't acknowledge that she is out of control, she needs not to have unfettered access to the family accounts.", "ESH. - I was 100% with OP until he brought in housekeeper into the mix.", "NTA...\n\nYour wife has a gamling/depression problem.\nYou need to sit down and ask her:.\n1.Why do you gamble\n2. Looking for jobs, what's the problem?\n\nI bet she would answer:\n\n1. It makes me happy when I win..\n\n\nSupport her in getting a job and tell her .. hell you are great, you did great befor covid, attack life.\n\n#edit As a starter , do not make it an issue about money.\nIf you have the money . She has a depression and need help .. use money for that", "I'm sorry...I'm not buying into your wife's whole financially controlling narrative.  There's a difference between controlling and being 'responsible'...it does not appear she understands the difference.", "You're NTA - ***but***:\n\n>I told her the housekeeper will have to approve the financial decisions in the household together with her.\n\nThis is not the answer. The housekeeper is there to clean the house and stay on top of chores - but that's it. Managing your wife's addiction to these games is *way* outside of her remit and I imagine she'd say 'no' to you request anyway.\n\nInstead, you need to take full control of the household budget and put a block on any spending on these games while you encourage your wife to seek professional help.", "NTA. Your wife has an addiction. She needs therapy, not a blank check. I know this because I have an addiction to addictions. If my husband hadn't put his foot down with me and set boundaries, I wouldn't be the better version of myself I am today. \n\nYour efforts should be applauded; it's a tough year financially and wasting money on things like this isn't wise for any income bracket.\n\nI would help her try to evaluate what feelings she had when she feels the \"need\" to play the games; getting mindful about what we're unwilling to feel in a given moment is very eye opening and can open doors to exploring why we are behaving the way we do.\n\nIf your wife doesn't agree she needs therapy, then yes, take it all away from her, give her an ultimatum if you must; she's got to come to terms with the fact that her recent behavior is harmful in general, not just because you can or can't afford it,\n\nBest to you, OP. Make sure you try to listen to your wife and see if she can be vulnerable with you about why she feels the way she does at her core, that is causing her to numb herself with gaming.\n\nPS - I spent $450 on a Korena mmorpg in a single December. I felt AWFUL about it. I can't imagine a world in which $10K is a pittance to her; imagine if she didn't have you to rely on financially, eh? I know you both made the decision together, but her lack of respect toward your income earning is alarming. I hope she respects you in other areas.", "NTA\n\nThe games are designed to be profitable. They use seriously messed up strategies to get you to spend more. There was a conference circling online with the main title of the presentation called how to turn \"players into payers\".\n\nHaving spent some (no where near 10k) on services within live service games I made a big decision to avoid any similar types of games again to not trigger the feelings again.", "Nta", "YTA to make your money disputes with your wife your housekeeper's problem - she shouldn't have to go near this argument with a barge pole. Nor should she agree to. You've already let her go once (at the time with a valid reason) however this is totally unreasonable working conditions to expect her to do. It's not housekeeping it's you avoiding your problems with your wife.\n\nGive her enough money to cover household expenses and no more if you're worried but don't try and drag anyone else into it unnecessarily! Especially when it's easily foreseeable the housekeeper will have to put up with a lot of flak from your wife in the process.", "NTA, gatcha is gambling. Your wife spent 10K of money that you earned on gambling. If this was a more traditional gambling method, most people would consider spending that much over 2 months a sign of addiction.", "ESH. I play gacha game and 10k really is preposterous. Your wife clearly has an addiction and should address it. \n\nHowever, how do you think it makes her feel to have a housekeeper have a final say on what she buys?\n\nI'm not going to pretend to know how it is to be a SAHW or live with one, but everyone is entitled to their hobbies. Even if they sound ridiculous to other people. The \"easiest\" solution would be for your wife to go back to work and have her own salary. She could then decide what to do with her \"fun money\". If that is not possible, since you are the sole earner, maybe you could have a stipulated amount for each to spend on personal things?", "NTA but your way of dealing with this needs improvement. \n\nYour wife may need therapy and/or a doctor\u2019s visit to get to the root of her gambling (that\u2019s what this is) and spending addiction. Is she depressed?  Feel alone/isolated/ or that she needs to contribute monetarily to the household? \n\nThen consider heart to heart discussions about your financial goals and the \u2018why\u2019 of what you are working towards. Eg: a paid off house, kids\u2019 college, etc. Couple\u2019s therapy may be helpful. \n\nMake a system for sharing joint finances. There are apps that help you do this. \n\nBringing a third party housekeeper in to help with kids is great. But not to be a financial gatekeeper for your wife. She won\u2019t learn and change at all. (Next thing you know she will have joined an MLM and there will be boxes of leggings in your garage.)\n\nAnd maybe she does need to return to the workforce to better channel her energy. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. Why are you hiring the housekeeper back? It is not like your wife got a job.", "Whoa.  I was with you until you said that the housekeeper is going to approve her purchases?\n\nNah, sir, that is not cool.\n\nYTA.  You need to figure out a different way to deal with this.", "This took a WILD turn, why would your housekeeper be an appropriate person for this at all? You were sort of on track up until there, but YTA\n\nReally you need to have a conversation with your wife about it and why she's doing it. Did she know she spent that much? Is it an addiction? Is it depression? Do you actually just make enough money it doesn't matter? Is she financially literate? Does she have some kind of financial trauma that makes budgeting hard or impossible, and it just became relevant when she got into these games? \n\nFrom there you can look into addiction counselors or therapists but suddenly and without warning cutting her off and setting up a gatekeeper a la your housekeeper truly sucks", "Maybe it\u2019s a mental health issue and she\u2019s struggling with depression and/or anxiety. I know when I have an up cycle of occurrences I increase my spending on things that make me happy, even if it\u2019s for a brief moment. Maybe talk to your wife and see if she\u2019s struggling and suggest she see a therapist.", "YTA while your wife has a problem and you're right that she needs help because who tf spends 10k like that.\n\nBut bringing in the housekeeper for such decisions? Wtf. That's just mean to the housekeeper.", "NTA\n\nIt's clear that you have genuine concerns about your wife's spending habits, especially considering the substantial amount of money she spent on gacha games in a short period of time. Financial responsibility and transparency are essential in a marriage, and it's entirely reasonable for you to want to address this issue.\n\nYour approach of suggesting professional help and reintroducing the housekeeper to assist with the kids and finances seems reasonable. It shows that you are not trying to control her but rather looking out for the well-being of the family as a whole. Gacha games, with their microtransactions and addictive nature, can lead to financial issues and even addiction for some people, which is a valid concern.\r  \n\r  \nIt's essential to have open and honest communication about finances in a marriage, and that includes setting limits and making responsible decisions together. Seeking professional help can be beneficial in understanding and managing any underlying issues related to excessive spending or impulse control.\r  \n\r  \nEncouraging your wife to seek help is an act of care, not control. It's crucial for both of you to be on the same page when it comes to financial decisions, especially when you are the sole source of income for the household. Your concerns are valid, and addressing them in a supportive and constructive manner can lead to a healthier financial environment for your family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
