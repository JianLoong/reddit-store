She lost her job cuz of the pandemic and given that we were stuck at home, most of the time, we decided that it was better for us to fire our housekeeper and have her be a stay at home mom at least until the kids (6f, 4m, 1m) were a little older. \n\nAnd its mostly been fine. We split chores about 40% me/ 60% her. She does most of the household work during the day, and I take over when I get home. Except on weekends, when we either work together or one of us relaxes. \n\nThe thing is, I gave her free reign on the monthly financials of the household. Our thought process was, she spends most of the time buying things for the family, she'd know best what to buy, how, when. And it would be a waste of time to discuss every purchase or financial decision. \n\nAnd that was fine as well. Until about 4 months ago when I noticed some discrepancies. I began noticing a bunch of 49.99$ or 99.99$ purchases. Initially I didn't pay them any mind, but over time there were more and more. So eventually I did a little digging, i checked who the purchases where made to, tracked how often. Looked at what my wife does in her free time.\n\nLong story short over the span of just the last 2 months she spent \\~10k dollars on gatcha games. \n\nLook, I'm not ridiculous, I understand people have hobbies that can require expensive purchases. I myslef spend maybe 200$ on video games every month. But 10k... in 2 months... on gatcha games, games specifically designed too keep you paying and paying. I consider it a real problem.\n\nSo I confronted her. I told her that I'm not giving her a blank check anymore, not unless she seeks professional help. I told her that I called our old housekeeper and she'll start working with us again this month to help her with the kids. \n\nShe said that its not that big of a deal because we can afford it. \n\nI told her yes, we can afford it, for now. But its a dangerous game she's playing and she needs help. I told her the housekeeper will have to approve the financial decisions in the household together with her. \n\nThen she called me an asshole and that I'm financially controlling her because I'm only source of income in the household. \n\nEdit: Some people seem to have misunderstood what i meant by housekeeper and financial decision. Obviously I meant daily expenses, which my wife was using as excuses to hide how much she paid for the video games.\n\nOfc I\u2019m not going to dump major financial decisions on my housekeeper.

Do you know if she was doing that with the money she earned before?\n\nPersonally, I think she should go back to work to pay off her gaming additction -- without a housekeeper.    Given that you've already rehired the housekeeper, you should still expect better accountability.  Starting with paying the housekeeper's salary with her earnings.\n\nI don't agree with giving the housekeeper authority over your wife when it comes to the budget though.   You just did an audit of your expenses, set a budget and fund it with a debit card.   If your wife wants something out of budget, that can be discussed when it happens.

She cleans houses. It's not her job to be a financial babysitter for your wife's app store addictions and you are putting her in a terrible position by expecting this of her. It sets up an innocent worker to bear the brunt of your wife's abuse and vitriol when you're not around.\n\nESH, just because this housekeeper thing is insane.", "NTA.

She spent $10k in two months on basically nothing at all. Nothing. It's not even gambling in the sense that she could have won something. She just spent it on digital nothingness. And if she keeps it up at that pace, you're NOT going to be able to afford it . . . you could lose your house, your savings . . . you could end up in the kind of debt you can't dig your way out of.\n\nYour wife has an addiction, most likely due to depression from losing her job and a DRASTIC life change.

The housekeeper is there to clean the house and stay on top of chores - but that's it. Managing your wife's addiction to these games is *way* outside of her remit and I imagine she'd say 'no' to your request anyway.\n\nInstead, you need to take full control of the household budget and put a block on any spending on these games while you encourage your wife to seek professional help.", "NTA. Your wife has an addiction. She needs therapy, not a blank check. I know this because I have an addiction to addictions. If my husband hadn't put his foot down with me and set boundaries, I wouldn't be the better version of myself I am today. \n\nYour efforts should be applauded; it's a tough year financially and wasting money on things like this isn't wise for any income bracket.\n\nI would help her try to evaluate what feelings she had when she feels the \"need\" to play the games; getting mindful about what we're unwilling to feel in a given moment is very eye opening and can open doors to exploring why we are behaving the way we do.\n\nIf your wife doesn't agree she needs therapy, then yes, take it all away from her, give her an ultimatum if you must; she's got to come to terms with the fact that her recent behavior is harmful in general, not just because you can or can't afford it,\n\nBest to you, OP. Make sure you try to listen to your wife and see if she can be vulnerable with you about why she feels the way she does at her core, that is causing her to numb herself with gaming.\n\nPS - I spent $450 on a Korena mmorpg in a single December. I felt AWFUL about it. I can't imagine a world in which $10K is a pittance to her; imagine if she didn't have you to rely on financially, eh? I know you both made the decision together, but her lack of respect toward your income earning is alarming. I hope she respects you in other areas.", "NTA\n\nThe games are designed to be profitable.

It's not housekeeping it's you avoiding your problems with your wife.\n\nGive her enough money to cover household expenses and no more if you're worried but don't try and drag anyone else into it unnecessarily! Especially when it's easily foreseeable the housekeeper will have to put up with a lot of flak from your wife in the process.", "NTA, gatcha is gambling. Your wife spent 10K of money that you earned on gambling. If this was a more traditional gambling method, most people would consider spending that much over 2 months a sign of addiction.", "ESH. I play gacha game and 10k really is preposterous. Your wife clearly has an addiction and should address it. \n\nHowever, how do you think it makes her feel to have a housekeeper have a final say on what she buys?\n\nI'm not going to pretend to know how it is to be a SAHW or live with one, but everyone is entitled to their hobbies. Even if they sound ridiculous to other people. The \"easiest\" solution would be for your wife to go back to work and have her own salary. She could then decide what to do with her \"fun money\". If that is not possible, since you are the sole earner, maybe you could have a stipulated amount for each to spend on personal things?", "NTA but your way of dealing with this needs improvement. \n\nYour wife may need therapy and/or a doctor\u2019s visit to get to the root of her gambling (that\u2019s what this is) and spending addiction. Is she depressed?  Feel alone/isolated/ or that she needs to contribute monetarily to the household? \n\nThen consider heart to heart discussions about your financial goals and the \u2018why\u2019 of what you are working towards. Eg: a paid off house, kids\u2019 college, etc. Couple\u2019s therapy may be helpful. \n\nMake a system for sharing joint finances. There are apps that help you do this. \n\nBringing a third party housekeeper in to help with kids is great. But not to be a financial gatekeeper for your wife. She won\u2019t learn and change at all.

You need to figure out a different way to deal with this.", "This took a WILD turn, why would your housekeeper be an appropriate person for this at all? You were sort of on track up until there, but YTA\n\nReally you need to have a conversation with your wife about it and why she's doing it. Did she know she spent that much? Is it an addiction? Is it depression? Do you actually just make enough money it doesn't matter? Is she financially literate? Does she have some kind of financial trauma that makes budgeting hard or impossible, and it just became relevant when she got into these games? \n\nFrom there you can look into addiction counselors or therapists but suddenly and without warning cutting her off and setting up a gatekeeper a la your housekeeper truly sucks", "Maybe it\u2019s a mental health issue and she\u2019s struggling with depression and/or anxiety. I know when I have an up cycle of occurrences I increase my spending on things that make me happy, even if it\u2019s for a brief moment.

Wtf. That's just mean to the housekeeper.", "NTA\n\nIt's clear that you have genuine concerns about your wife's spending habits, especially considering the substantial amount of money she spent on gacha games in a short period of time. Financial responsibility and transparency are essential in a marriage, and it's entirely reasonable for you to want to address this issue.\n\nYour approach of suggesting professional help and reintroducing the housekeeper to assist with the kids and finances seems reasonable. It shows that you are not trying to control her but rather looking out for the well-being of the family as a whole. Gacha games, with their microtransactions and addictive nature, can lead to financial issues and even addiction for some people, which is a valid concern.\r  \n\r  \nIt's essential to have open and honest communication about finances in a marriage, and that includes setting limits and making responsible decisions together. Seeking professional help can be beneficial in understanding and managing any underlying issues related to excessive spending or impulse control.\r  \n\r  \nEncouraging your wife to seek help is an act of care, not control. It's crucial for both of you to be on the same page when it comes to financial decisions, especially when you are the sole source of income for the household.

They\u2019re very well-designed for their purpose, which is to get you to give them as much money as possible. Your wife in particular falls directly into their favorite target demographic: adults with consistent free time and disposable income.

Once she starts having to grind for the gatcha stuff, she'll eventually quit the game.", "gacha games are very dangerous if you dont have any self control. i would know. i play 4 of them. but i have my own budged that i allow myself to use for the games, its a small amount and it isnt for every individual game, its for the 4 of them so choices have to be made every now and then. 10k in 2 months is not only quite impressive , it also definitely a problem. NTA op good on you to take control over the situation before it gets worse.\n\nisnt there a way she could maybe work just 1 day a week so she could use that money for her games?", "INFO - Is the housekeeper in the know and agreeing to the job? Is she getting paid more for it?\n\nNTA  IF - The housekeeper is adequately paid for the extra work and is let known that keeping your wife from the gatcha devil is part of the job they are agreeing to.\n \n\nESH if the answer is no to either of those questions.", "Lol. Nta. This probably won't be an easy fix and will be the beginning of the end for you. Like any addiction, the addiction must be acknowledged by the addict and you can't force that to happen", "She could definitely get a job to support her games. I 100% agree about housekeeper. That seemed off to me.", "It\u2019s her addiction is pretty much gambling at this rate.", "Agree. As someone who has spent on games before and has also struggled with budgeting and how addictive they can be, limiting her access to the budget it\u2019s fine until she gets help. Getting professional help, maybe talking to a financial expert to learn ways to budget and coming up with something together are good ideas. Bringing in a housekeeper and having her have this control over your wife it\u2019s not.", "it does not appear she understands the difference.", "I'd also frame this to your wife as a gambling addiction, as that is how a lot of countries are classifying it now. I can attest, I spent hundreds on a gacha game and once the server shut down, I quit all gacha cold turkey. I knew if I found another I loved I'd just do it again. She needs to stop or seek therapy.", "agreeeeed.\n\nif op wants someone to advise his wife financially, they should get a financial advisor too if op cant do it. therapist, financial advisor, housekeeper so wife has less to worry about, then get her back to work if she has too much time on her hands(and is ready).\n\nthe advisor can have a list of approved things that she can do on her own, then suggest ways to mitigate the problem, and also suggest ways op can be involved in approval and planning of spending. \n\ndont dump it on the housekeeper... its not their job, especially if this is an addiction and she takes it out on the cleaner all day.", "I'll bet she didn't even realize it had gotten to that extent.", "You\u2019re not wrong, but how does his actions make the wife\u2019s actions okay? I think you\u2019re looking for ESH because both the wife and OP have been AH", "I agree with what you\u2019re saying. I had initially thought that OP meant the housekeeper would now be the one buying things the family needed and didn\u2019t see that as strange. That\u2019s not unusual for people of wealth to have someone else manage day to day purchases. But your comment helped clarify that it was all financial control.", "OP is NTA, but I definitely don't understand why he's dragging the housekeeper into this.", "I think it depends how this is arranged. Is the housekeeper going to be in charge of purchases for the household like groceries and household supplies, then OP is taking care of the rest of the finances with a budget for wife's discretionary spending on her own separate account, or does the housekeeper have to play mom to the wife? The former could work if compensated for.", "Gambling without the possibility of paying out"]}
