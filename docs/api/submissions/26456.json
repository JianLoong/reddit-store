I (38F) call my SIL (33F) to ask if her and her Husband could come over a little early to watch my Daughter while we set up the party. SIL told me she is going on a bar crawl the night before so she will do her best but she can't promise anything, it depends how her night goes. \n\nI asked her if she was planning on coming to her nieces birthday hungover, she said once again it depends on how the night goes. I asked her if she thought it was appropriate to come to a child's birthday party hungover and be around children hungover.  She didn't seem to see a problem with it.\n\nI told her I thought it was immature that she couldn't control her drinking Saturday night when she knows she has a party the next day its just one night. I get acting like that in your 20s but in your 30s its a little ridiculous. I told her that if she is hungover I would rather her not come to the party at all. She said fine and we have not heard from her since. My husband agrees with me but now MIL and FIL are upset and it is putting a damper on my Daughter's 5th birthday.

None of your invitees are required to circumscribe their lives or live a different way because you want some 90-minute event for a kid who won't even remember it to be a certain way.\n\nIt's a backyard party. This is your SIL who has a fun pub crawl the night before. She is not required to (a) watch your child, (b) show up when you say, or (c) refrain from drinking because you say so.\n\nYou presume and ask way too much. And I say that as a person who's not wild about drinking or hung over people.", "YTA \n\nYour SIL has *plans* the night before.  Set plans. It is none of your business what her plans are. I'm sure she is not doing this alone, and it's a group thing.  That's generally what happens when you have plans like hers. You think she should not go to her plans because your 5 year old is having a child's birthday party? \n\nYou asked for her help. She said she would do her best.  You decided her best wasn't good enough, lectured her, and then told her that your judgment was she was no longer welcome.  \n\nRealistically,  your daughter would have hugged her at arrival and then ignored her during the party.  She would be engaged with the other children.   Your SIL is sitting in the corner, observing the party and nursing a headache.    No one, but you know, unless you yap it around.  \n\nYTA", "YTA Why are you controlling a grown woman\u2019s activities? You asked and she said maybe. End of story.

You really need a life.", "I don't think being hungover is a big deal and your 5 year olds party isn't going to be so important your SIL should change her plans. She is an adult and I think it's pretty weird that you care so deeply. I wouldn't talk to you either because you seem self righteous and judgemental.", "INFO: Your party, your rules but why do you care?\n\nYou sound quite judgy about your SILs lifestyle and a bit pissed that they are not able to fulfil your babysitting expectations because they have other plans. That both are quite toxic treats you should drop. Did that influence your way of handling that situation?", "YTA.  How does her hangover even impact you?  You realize she likely won't be the only hungover adult there, right?", "YTA\n\nIf she is still drunk that is one thing, being hungover is another.\n\nYes it's one day she doesn't have to drink but it's going to be her issue and you are asking her to drop her plans to help you out.", "YTA\n\nYou are causing drama and issues in the family because 2 adults have late night plans the day before their niece\u2019s 5th birthday party and they won\u2019t change their plans & commit to coming early for your convenience?\n\nThis sounds more like you guys are jealous of them enjoying their childfree life.", "Yta what your sil does the night before is none of your damn business. \n\nAs long as she doesn\u2019t show up drunk? It\u2019s not of your damn business.\n\nIf she wants to come to a child\u2019s birthday party hungover it is on her.\n\nThe world doesn\u2019t revolve around your kid.\n\nIt sounds like to me your ur passed because she didn\u2019t you use her to babysit while you set up the party.\n\nIt also sounds like to me sil dodged a bullet when you disinvited her! \n\nShe is an adult that doesn\u2019t need you and your husbands permission or approval to go out and have fun!", "\"Women who don't have kids MUST be available to act as my servant or I'll shame them\"\n\nYou clearly feel entitled to her time and her babysitting services, which she does NOT owe you.

You sound positively exhausting to be around. Did your husband actually agree with you or did you tell him he agrees with you? I have a feeling it's the later and he just went \"yup sure thing honey\" to make you be quiet. \n\nYTA! Its immature and wildly inappropriate to think you have that much control over another adults activities and I'm not surprised you MIL or FIL are upset. Nor am I surprised SIL jumped at the chance you gave her to bail on the party. The only one you successfully hurt was your daughter.", "YTA. She is the one who will feel the hangover. No one else will even know. This is weird.", "You are being a very judgmental. Also you are asking her to revolve her life around you. That's very selfish. If she's a good person to your child and you, then I am not seeing the issue here. If she wants to sleep in because she knows she's going out the night before, why is that any of your business?  You asked if she could help, she said maybe. I'd apologize to her if you value the relationship.", "YTA - Who are you to expect to be able to manage your SIL's life?  So she goes out the night before and drinks before the party and is hungover.  Her being hungover affects just her, not you or your child.  Get off your high horse already.  You live in an adult world, deal with it.", "Why should she stay in on Saturday night to attend a 5 year old's birthday party?  That makes no sense. I don't see a problem with her being hungover at a 5 years old's birthday party. She's not drunk, and not the star of the party so who cares?", "YTA! Your sister in law clearly gave you the heads up that she may be late. The only reason you are pissed is because your free baby-sitting service won't be available. \nYou can't tell a grown woman how to show up for a party, even if it is for your child. You are unnecessarily creating issues out of nowhere.", "YTA. You're mad about her not babysitting while you do party prep.", "Yta.", "YTA. You know hangovers are not contagious, right?", "YTA - unless she\u2019s crawling on the floor and spewing her guts up it\u2019s really doesn\u2019t matter if she is hungover or not, Jesus \ud83d\ude44", "YTA. You asked her to come early to babysit and she couldn't commit to it. That's reasonable. You want to uninvite her because she doesn't want to give up another couple hours of recovery so you can do setup? And then you want to judge her for her pretty normal social engagement? Get over yourself and let people have fun.", "**YTA**\n\nYou come across judgemental and pretty self-absorbed. You asked and she said no, that's where it should be left. It really isn't any of your business what your SIL does previous day, week, month leading up to your child's birthday party. You do realize that your daughter will probably (hopefully!) have so much fun she won't care if SIL's there or not.\n\nAre you also **that** person who tells other ppl that their hobbies/interests are childish & they should grow up and frown upon other women because they don't dress for their age etc etc", "YTA I don't understand how being hungover around children is inappropriate in any way. Is it also inappropriate to have a headache or be tired around children? Is it going to damage the children's morals if she is wearing sunglasses? \n\nYour child's party isn't such an important event that all the guests need to spend 24 hours preparing themselves for it.", "YTA. I don't think you even care if she's hungover, you're just salty she isn't giving you free childcare to set up.", "YTA \n\nFor thinking people have to block off and not have plans the NIGHT BEFORE your daughter party. She isn\u2019t that special. SIL might have been hungover, oh fucking well. \n\nYou did put a damper on your daughters party smh", "YTA x 1000. I think you have a deeper rooted problem with your SIL that you haven\u2019t mentioned.", "To me IMO it sounds like you are a little jealous. Who cares if she is 30 and going out getting drunk. I\u2019m 50 and I do it every once in a while. Not really your place to dictate. Hangovers suck but they have stuff to decrease the headaches now. It\u2019s a 5 year olds birthday. Focus on that. And why do you need someone to watch her while you set up? Have her help. Make it a game. I have three kids and when we had parties for them they all helped when they were big enough. Stop being so judgmental and focus on your kiddo. YTA", "YTA, stop policing how people have fun. You aren\u2019t your SIL\u2019s parents. Also, who gives a flying F if a person comes to a kids party a bit hungover? How does that affect 5yr olds? They aren\u2019t old enough to understand alcohol and adults consuming it. If I were your SIL, I\u2019d be thrilled you disinvited me. Going to kids birthday parties are the worst.", "YTA\n\nYou invited her to a party but expected her to watch your kid first. I think that's what you're really mad about.", "YTA,hungover isn\u2019t drunk", "YTA. She\u2019s a grown woman. She can do exactly what she likes. If you are that bothered tell her not to come.

She\u2019s a guest.", "Well this worked out well for you lol\n\nOh and YTA\u2026y\u2019all having bible study at this party?", "YTA - your SIL has her own plans that do not disrupt your event. She is a grown adult that can do what she wants! It sounds like she was fine to still attend the next day & you\u2019re upset that she cannot commit to helping you while you party prep. If she wants to attend feeling like crap, then that\u2019s her decision. If she\u2019s inappropriate at the party, that\u2019s another story, but feeling ill is not a big deal.", "Yta and a controlling one too! Fun police like the 5 year olds would know she was out drinking\u2026. I wouldn\u2019t come if I was her.", "YTA\n\nWho do you think you are, deciding what someone can do in their own free time? Wtf. \n\nIf she has a hangover that\u2019s her problem, not yours. That\u2019s not disruptive to your kid\u2019s birthday party. Get a grip.", "YTA, setup for the party WITH your child. You don\u2019t say this is a surprise party, 5yo are very capable and not infants that require extra watching.  SIL should not be burdened by you or the party.  It\u2019s a 5year olds party for goodness sake! \nMe thinks you are jealous of your SIL being able to go out for a pub crawl.", "She\u2019s also a grown ass woman who is going out one day of one weekend that so happens to be the night before her niece\u2019s birthday party. She is prioritizing both time with her friends and your daughter\u2019s party. She\u2019s likely had her plans for a while and as an adult it\u2019s not always easy to find the time to get together with friends. People are allowed to have fun, however the see fit, even in their thirty\u2019s. \nShe is a guest at the party, not the host or the one who has volunteered to watch over children, that was you. I wouldn\u2019t want to be around a ton of children if I were hungover, but she planned to be there for her niece even if she felt like garbage. When your daughter notices that she isn\u2019t there, it\u2019s on you. You\u2019re giving \u201cI expect you on call 24/7 with no pay increase\u201d vibes. YTA.", "**YTA** \n\nThe only reason SIL\u2019s plans affect you is because  you are asking her *for a favour*-  which is to come early to babysit your daughter. \n\nNot being able to do you a favour is not a good reason to be disinvited.", "YTA. 5 year olds don't know what hungover is unless you told them, in which case YTA double. She can be tired at a kids party if she choses. \n\nPS A 5 year old's birthday is really not that important to a lot of adults. SIL might only see these people once a year.", "YTA. \n\nShe's not immature at all. \n\nShe's made a clear and rational social decision based on the options you forced on her. She'd rather go on a night out with friends than attend your daughter's birthday. You're not her priority. Make of that what you will.", "Yta,  omg a hangover!  I hope you have pearls to clutch", "YTA. Why can\u2019t she be hungover around kids? This makes no sense. Your being very judgemental.", "Sorry, did you say you invited her to a 5 year old\u2019s birthday party, or a black tie tea and crumpets with the King? Good grief. If she wants to be hungover around a bunch of screaming children that\u2019s her prerogative. It\u2019s not her job to help you set up. Hire a babysitter.

If she showed up drunk than yeah, that\u2019s an issue. But if she shows up hungover that\u2019s your SIL\u2019s problem not yours.  Pretty damn judgemental.", "YTA. You can decide who you want around your kids but acting like a hungover adult is some how inappropriate for children to see is wild. I agree with all the other commenters who have mentioned that this is retaliation for SIL not babysitting.", "YTA.\n\nI for one would never let a little kid's birthday party (well, unless is was *my* kid) dictate what I did or didn't do on a completely different day.", "YTA You put a damper on your daughter's party.  Not your SIL.", "YTA \n\nStop getting all up in her business. It sounds like you just enjoy nitpicking from your high horse.\n\nRelax and stop being insufferable. Your 5yo\u2019s birthday is a perfectly fine event to show up hungover to. \n\nYou owe everyone a giant apology. But I suspect this is a pattern with you and your ILs don\u2019t like you because you\u2019ve been picky and judge-y in the past. Don\u2019t be surprised if they just slowly back out of your life. \n\nI feel real sorry for your daughter. Perfectionist judgy moms suck.", "YTA. There's nothing wrong with being hungover around kids. It'll only bring discomfort to the person who is hungover.\n\nThis reads a lot like you're upset she wouldn't change her plans so she could babysit your kid, and you got mad.", "YTA. Your child isn\u2019t that special. No one should have to not drink just because they have a kids bday party next day. Unless she shows up drunk, I think you should calm down", "YTA. She\u2019s adult and allowed to go out and drink without your permission and regardless of what you have going on in your life the next day. Find different childcare and get over yourself.", "YTA. I luv it when my SIL shows up with a hangover cause she\u2019s the first to leave", "YTA \n\nSo you are upset cause the babysitter wont be available?", "YTA. Mind your damn business.", "YTA\n\nThis started as an ask for babysitting and slid into judgmental shaming for something that hasn\u2019t even happened yet.", "YTA even though you did her a favor, really.  A child\u2019s bday with a hangover sounds nightmarish. It\u2019s not your business what she does on Saturday night, you were asking her for a favor so it may have been helpful to tamp down the judgmental attitude. But it seems to have worked out for the best, she gets to nurse her hangover and you get to focus on your event. Problem solved.", "YTA. First you expect free childcare, and when she doesn't promise it, you get all judgey how a grown woman spends her free time. She even said she wouldn't come if she was too sick.", "YTA - there are hangover cures in abundance out there.  You are out of line by ASSUMING she is going to be a wreck the next day.  I would have done the same thing she is doing by not giving you any response to your entitlement.", "YTA.", "YTA. She\u2019s an adult who can manage herself. Don\u2019t be such a prude. Adults are allowed to drink and get silly and attend family functions the next day.", "YTA. Come on, really? You don\u2019t think hungover adults are appropriate to be around kids? There is even an episode of Bluey in which the parents are hungover.", "YTA", "YTA.  Just because she is hung over doesn\u2019t mean she will be acting inappropriately.", "YTA.", "YTA, you don't get to dictate how other people live their lives or whether someone goes out the night before your kid's bday. You are being ridiculously controlling. Showing up drunk is one thing and I can understand the issue with that but being hungover is essentially just being overly dehydrated and not feeling your best. Be honest the real reason you have a problem with it is because you wanted her to come early and watch your kid.\n\n\"She said fine and we have not heard from her since.\"\n\nWell yea no shit.", "You're trying to dictate what other adults do on their own time because you're scared they might be a little hungover at your kid's party? Talk about controlling.\n\nYTA.", "YTA- It\u2019s a backyard party for a 5 year old. You are being way over the top. She has to sit and eat cake right? You can do that hungover.

But it sounds chill so maybe you should also probably kind of a lot chill out too\u2026", "YTA. She was honest with you about her potential state of mind, and you were a jerk about it.

The horror", "YtA\n\nBut to be clear\u2026how do you think her being hungover affects your child? You thinking it\u2019s inappropriate makes me wonder if you know what being hungover even is. Being hungover means feeling a bit sick and maybe having a headache, but that\u2019s it. Her judgement isn\u2019t impaired. Her behavior is totally within her control.", "YTA.  There\u2019s no danger in her coming to a party.  you\u2019re just salty you didn\u2019t get a babysitter, now you\u2019re really stretching it.", "YTA.

Do you think your 5-year-old will remember this party beyond a month?  NO child will have enough situational awareness to be all OMG Auntie is HUNGOVER!  You are pissed off that your idea of her free babysitting flew out the window so you are drumming up some imaginary outrage here.", "YTA.  A bar crawl is a planned event that she\u2019s probably doing with friends and has been excited about for a while.  It in no way indicates she has a drinking problem or \u201ccan\u2019t control herself for one night.\u201d But you think she should change her plans so she can babysit your kid?

Stay in your lane, OP.", "YTA - you gave her a gift. Children\u2019s bday parties are the WORST things ever. We avoid them like the plague. I het she had the best Saturday night out knowing she wouldn\u2019t be burdened with that event the following day.  \nAlso, kids aren\u2019t going to be able to tell she is hungover. Take a \u201cchill pill\u201d lady.", "YTA.  I can\u2019t believe how self-righteous and controlling you are.  You don\u2019t get to dictate other adults\u2019 behavior.

Oh no what horror, a grown woman might have a headache at a child\u2019s birthday", "YTA\nWhat would SIL have to be doing at this party, that she can't be hungover? Do you expect her to personally entertain a herd of kids?", "YTA, I can\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve gone to and event hungover. You\u2019re looking for child care so you can set up the party. Ask the in-laws to come over and help out, ask a different family member to watch your daughter while you set up. Let you SIL enjoy life.", "YTA- tho I am wondering why anyone with any kinda hangover would want to be around a bunch of screaming kids - you probably did the SIL a favor", "Her life, social or otherwise, does not revolve around your child. \n\nYTA", "YTA - When is being hungover such a crime? She's been transparent. If you said to me either a pub crawl Saturday night with my mates or a 5 year olds birthday party Sunday morning I know which one I'm picking.", "YTA, how are you going to control if any of the other guests are hungover? \nSure being hungover at a 5-yr old's birthday party sounds like 100% pure hell to me!!! But sounds like she would show up anyway because she loves your daughter.\nSeems like you are focused on the wrong things!", "YTA and judgy. Being hungover around kids isnt a bad thing... it's annoying for the adult but kids won't be effected by a headache.", "YTA. Are you aware that being hungover is not the same as being drunk? She\u2019d have a headache and wouldn\u2019t feel well, but there is nothing about being hungover that would be inappropriate. I wouldn\u2019t want to go to a kid\u2019s birthday party if I was hungover, but maybe that\u2019s just me. Sounds like you\u2019re just pissy that she doesn\u2019t want to change her plans to be your babysitter.", "YTA\n\nShe did not say that she would be coming early while hungover. It is not even guaranteed she will be. You are making a lot of assumptions here. It's a 5 year old's party, it is not some major event that she would be attending. Obviously you have issues with her that you need to work out. \n\nWhat time are you having the party? How early did you ask her to come over? These are some other important pieces of information.", "YTA: why do you feel entitled to dictate her actions the night before? Why do you feel your child\u2019s 5th birthday should have priority over everyone else\u2019s life?", "YTA.  Can\u2019t believe someone has to explain it to you.  She has an event the night before that may mean she\u2019s suffering a bit the next day.  Will your kid notice? No.  Will your kid remember her bday in 10-20 yrs and think \u201cgee, wonder if my aunt was hungover on my 5th bday party\u201d? Also no.  This is coming from a mom w 3 older kids.  Let it go, this is a silly hill to die on that literally no one will remember- except maybe you/", "YTA Jesus so self righteous", "YTA.", "> I told her that if she is hungover I would rather her not come to the party at all.

YTA", "YTA you asked for a favor and she wasn\u2019t able to do it so she told you right then and you got mad?", "YTA. Are you perhaps a bit jealous that you aren\u2019t having any fun in your 30s? That when you were her age you had a newborn to take care of and couldn\u2019t do bar crawls anymore? Let her live her life. It\u2019s a 5 year old\u2019s birthday party in a backyard, not the Met Gala. If she shows up and feels sick, that\u2019s her problem.

You just want to use your child as an excuse to be judgmental and controlling.", "You must be fun at parties.\n\nOh wait, you probably only get invited to ones for kids.", "I think it's inappropriate to be an asshole around children but that doesn't stop you", "Yikes just say you\u2019re mad she wont babysit.", "Why though?", "Why?", "Sounds like you also have an issue with her tapping out after uninviting her?", "Why? You don\u2019t get a headache or feel sick around your children ever?", "Lol but why? A hangover is usually just a headache and maybe a bit of nausea. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s intending to come actively drunk and high. THAT would be inappropriate.", "And I think it\u2019s inappropriate to be this uptight and have children, yet here you are.", "No, you are a judgemental person and just unhappy that you can't get a free babysitter. YTA.", "Why? What does hungover look like to you that you'd think this?", "The kids won\u2019t know she\u2019s hungover.", "\ud83d\ude44", "Then lucky you that she's not coming.", "Why??", "Lolllll. How absurd.", "Does your child know what a hangover is and what it looks like? Your kid shouldn\u2019t be able to tell and would just think your SIL is a little tired or under the weather. And in the grand scheme of things likely won\u2019t remember either.\n\nThere\u2019s a massive difference between being drunk and being hungover.", "There is a lesson for you to learn here before your child grows up.  If you give someone choices (or an Ultimatum), YOU NEED TO GIVE THEM CHOICES THAT YOUR ARE OK WITH.\nYou gave your SIL 2 choices, she chose one and now you're upset.  Them pulling out is all on you.", "Can you explain why? How would the children even know?? She\u2019ll just be low energy and maybe have a headache?", "Why? Being hungover is not the same as drunk. You can't police what others do. It isn't her child so why does she need to change her plans for you?", "Kids won't even notice or care", "Do you think she's going to explicitly tell your daughter and her friends that she's hungover and explain what that means? Because a 5 year old is not going to notice, understand, or care about the concept of a hangover. This is strictly a you issue.", "Well that's pretty dumb honestly. You shouldn't expect anyone to agree or even care about that silly opinion. Nevermind change their plans. A hangover is a cool word for headache and dehydration. Nothing more.", "YTA, it's not like she's drinking at the bday party. Honestly, if someone ever acted like that towards me id by a lottle shot bottle and look into your eyes when i drank it. Also, you shouldn't tell someone to act their age while you're acting like a jealous teen.", "Nah, you\u2019re just butthurt bc she won\u2019t babysit and bitter bc she has the fun you don\u2019t allow yourself to have anymore. YTA.", "Or it'll just be op & sil cause no one else will turn up", "My sister did once. Her ex didn\u2019t tell her she was supposed to bring his son to a party and the night before she drank a lot.

Whenever those pictures (that I'm just SO glad they made sure to tag me in) show up in Facebook memories I die a little inside embarrassed, but don't untag myself as a yearly reminder that we don't get drunk before baby showers for our own sake and the sake of the pictures that will live on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\noops.", "Sure, but it's self punishment, doesn't affect the kids even one iota.", "Oh my god. I would find that torture. It's going to be loud, little people moving around, and so many colors. Having a hangover would be a nightmare.\n\nOP, YTA for what you said. It's fine to say hey, I'd prefer that you not be hungover at my child's party. Maybe we can plan a fun lunch date with her when you are up to it. Go ahead and take the day to recover and have fun on your pub crawl.", "Right? That would be punishment enough. Far more effective than being scolded by her SIL", "I wouldn't want to go to a childrens party", "who wants to go to a childs party, period?", "I was going to say that going to a children's party hung over would be WAY worse for her than anyone else.  I cannot even imagine the torture of kids screaming and a hangover", "I once took my two kids (10 and 12) plus a couple friends each, so 6 in total, to Six Flags for the day with a horrible hangover. It was summer, so of course we were doing both the regular park and the water park. It was at least 200 degrees, and I followed along behind these kids like a sherpa loaded down with all their shit.  It was all I could do to keep upright and stay hydrated.\n\nBut I wasn't going to disappoint my kids because of my own dumbass decisions. So now they remember what a blast they had that day, and how their friends all thought I was the coolest mom ever, instead of remembering how mom broke a promise b/c she was too hungover to get out of bed.\n\nBest decision I ever made.", "I wouldn't either, but it's not like she didn't know there was a party. Sister would've been the only one dealing with the consequences, so... go do what you want, lol. Enjoy your headache in the morning exacerbated by 5 year old's at a party. Who cares if she's hungover? As long as she's not puking everywhere, it's fine.", "I can go hangover anywhere, nothing helps.", "[I have a hangover, can anyone tell me what that means?\n\nIt means you are drunk\n\nWrong! It means I was drunk yesterday]", ">Honestly though, being ~~hungover~~ at a kids birthday party sounds like hell...\n\nThere, FIFY. You're welcome. \ud83d\ude09", "This is the answer. Op seems incredibly uptight.", "I thought the hangover was the tail end of being drunk. Though come to think of it, it doesn't feel the same at all. Like I'm fully in control of my speech and actions when I have a hangover, but I feel horrible.", "At the same time,  if she's hungover, she's going to be irritable, I could see why op wouldn't want her around young children that can get loud and pushy.", "Right?? My friends are mid to late twenties, many are single, already planning a night out together to let off some steam a bit often happens weeks in advance. I imagine that it\u2019s even harder in your thirties. \n\nNot even to mention, I\u2019m only 27, and had 2 glasses of wine over a few hours yesterday and am lightly hungover. Similar to the prior point: I expect that gets worse in your thirties too. \n\nOP can reign it in. She deals with hungover people more than she thinks, and it really isn\u2019t that serious if SIL is functional (as most people are while hungover) and able to be supportive and happy with the kid and adults.", "Every child's party I have been to as an adult has had a decent amount of booze at it. Hell, we were at a friend's kid's first birthday party a few weeks ago and it was held at a brewery and the grandparents were paying the tab. \n\nOne of my college roommate's was Mexican and those family birthdays were the best. He had like 7 or 8 cousins who were between 8-13. Every time one of them had a birthday, the parents would hire a street taco dude, put out a full bar, and the whole family would party like crazy. It was a blast.", "In my experience that type of hangover only happens if you got blackout drunk the night before.\n\nNormal drunk + good night sleep + long shower, painkillers & something non alcoholic to drink and most people will be perfectly fine by the time the kids party starts.", "If I was the SIL, I would tell her I had a bar crawl planned the night before EVERY function!", "I feel that is something OP would have mentioned if that was the case.", "The hung over part. If she doesn't know whether or not she will be impaired the day after, that is a problem.", "Her sister is doing a bar crawl. I don't think she's planning on sticking to two glasses of wine.", "Right!!! OP sounds like a stick in the mud.", "I'm happy for the SIL to have learned ahead of time that she was invited to this party as staff, not as a guest.", "Some situations call for emergency drinking practice. \ud83c\udf7b", "But don't you know that if OP disapproves of something, then anyone who disagrees is a bad person? C'mon! Get with the program! \ud83e\udd2a", "Tbf OP can decide who has contact with their children so they have a word in that one for this case.", "Unless OP and her husband are getting incredibly drunk often enough for their kids to put two and two together all the birthday girl is going to think is that auntie is feeling a little under the weather. Assuming she's even showing any signs of being hungover.", "I think OP is probably judgy AF about everything\nOP - YTA", "And let it be a reminder to friends and family not to plan baby showers the day after St Patrick's!", "I once went to babysit my 3 nieces with a hangover, which is usually fine. It was daytime, their house, and they were old enough to occupy themselves for the most part. \n\nThen I arrive, and I\u2019m informed that I\u2019m now also taking one to a party. I don\u2019t have to stay, the kids and I know where it is right? (We don\u2019t.) \n\nSo backed into a corner, I take them to the party. Turns out it\u2019s a trampoline/jumping castle\u2026thing. Nice and loud and echoey. The kids also need supervising, so no I *can\u2019t* leave. I spent five frigging hours surrounded by small children screaming, and strange mums twice my age trying to make small talk. With the odd diversion to rescue a crying child that would insist on climbing *up* the various jumpy-things, before wimping out of the actual jump. \n\nBy the end of the day, I hated everything and everyone.", "Going to kids parties in general is pure torture (like I feel like a mombie after hosting my kid's party every year). I can't imagine hung over. I get a headache from the screaming and excitement alone.", "Especially if it's not your child and yet you're being volunteered to babysit while they set things up.", "Lol love that show", "\u201cYou have a disease, dude\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cFreddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFreddy\u2014*shut up*\u201d", "You\u2019re my new favourite person.", "Totally!   Quit policing what sister does. Op YTA", "It\u2019s entirely possible to wake up still drunk from the night before so I think maybe that\u2019s where people get confused? It\u2019s a VERY different feeling though and is probably an indication you drank way too much and should look into that. \n\n\nIt\u2019s possible to get drunk, sober up and not be hungover at all, whereas a hangover comes as a result of alcohol or substance use. Some people don\u2019t suffer too much and just feel fatigued, as I\u2019ve got older my hangovers have got\u2026well, horrible, so I don\u2019t really drink any more. Not worth the pain!", "Or maybe she's an adult who can control her irritation and not lash out at children because she's not feeling great?", "I feel like if anything that would be the \u2018lesson\u2019 - hungover and feel like you\u2019re dying? Tough luck, you promised Junior you would sing karaoke and play tag, get on with it. Shes old enough to know what she\u2019s getting herself into. \n\n\nNow she gets to stay out late guilt free, have a lie in and grab a takeaway the next day instead of watching the kids earlier than planned\u2026doesn\u2019t sound that bad to me.", "Those are best kid parties. Their is always an adult that overindulge and the comic of the party.", "I may notice it more because I\u2019m not much of a drinker. I like having a nice buzz and I enjoy a night out occasionally, but I find the feeling of drunkenness unpleasant and disorienting. I can always smell it on a person after a night of heavy drinking, like a pub crawl. It\u2019s like please don\u2019t hug me right now friend, lol. I think people don\u2019t realize it because we\u2019re all nose blind to our own stank.  The only cure is time, for your body to sweat it all out.  I\u2019m sure that for a regular night out your method works.", "That little pub moved RIGHT into my fridge! How convenient!", "\ud83e\udd23", "Yep and the SIL accepted being disinvited without being nasty about it.", "Absolutely true. No issue there. OP can\u2019t dictate how sister lives when not around OP\u2019s family.", "The kid is 5. Why does he know what a hangover is? I don't know. Still just a weird thing.", "or plan ANYTHING the day after st patrick's!", "You got hoodwinked by your sibling on that one.", "Seriously. Drunk or sober = hard pass", "This is the first comment I\u2019ve read acknowledging that not everyone experiences bad hangovers. I don\u2019t drink a lot, but when I do get drunk, I\u2019m just really thirsty the next morning since alcohol dehydrates you. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s entirely possible SIL will be completely fine, especially if the party\u2019s in the afternoon. Even if she\u2019s not, I agree with other comments that it\u2019s not really OP\u2019s problem, but I\u2019m curious if she even knows whether SIL will actually be miserable or if she\u2019s just on her high horse for no reason at all.", "I'm just saying I'm not thinking of it as punishment/lesson, but that op doesn't want to be \"the mom who invited someone to a birthday party that screamed at the kids to shut the fuck up\" it's her parents that are mad the sister won't attend, sister already made the party an afterthought to her barcrawl.", "Tbf I'd think it was a relief, in the SIL's shoes.", "Exactly", "Yeah ofc not.", "I get real hungry and I'm a bit tired but I've never had headaches or felt crap the next morning after a night of drinking, and while I don't drink often to get drunk, when I do I tend to drink fairly heavy\n\nI've done full 8hr shifts while hungover. If OP gives the SIL time and I'm sure she'll be fine", "I have been hungover and never yelled at any children I may have been in contact with lmao\n\nAnd when I am invited somewhere, I block out the time of the event. How I spend my time before that party is my choice and does not mean the event is an afterthought.", "She was planning both and then OP got mad that she won't come early to babysit. OP already made her sister's life an afterthought to her own lack of planning.", "Yes.   My thought was good riddance.   Sucks for the niece (and the SIL in that regard), but the audacity to be upset that SIL is drinking the night before and may be hungover around children... I'd be glad to be rid of that relationship."]}
