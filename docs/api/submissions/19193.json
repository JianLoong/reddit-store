I should mention that I decided in addition to my mom and husband, I wanted my dad to visit after baby was born. I needed his support.

But then you need your dad's \"support\" afterwards, but his parents still arent welcome that day.  \n\nDid you ever consider that maybe he wanted his parents there to support him and to share in & celebrate the birth? \n\n Your husband sucks for \"going off\" on his dad for wanting to see the baby and for buying into your manipulation & control.  His parents suck a tiny wee bit for pushing a bit to see the baby and then not visiting when invited because they didnt feel welcome.

Yes you carried the child and gave birth but your partner has a child also and his wants for his parents to bond with the child, and his parents want to bond with their grandchild matter also.  You have not given any valid reason for keeping his parents away - such as they are child abusers, or have had cps called on them repeatedly or that they are axe murderers.  \n\nHonestly you seem exhausting & insufferable to be around and like you will never be happy with anything and will always find something to complain about.\n\nHow do you feel good about yourself knowing you are preventing his parents from developing a relationship with their grandchild, knowing your actions are hurtful to your husband and will be hurtful to your child in the future if they are made aware that you didnt allow their paternal grandparents to develop a relationship with them.", "You're being somewhat manipulative and creating a situation whereby your husband will resent you and see you as someone who prioritises only her own parents, relegating his parents to the role of 'less important people'. \n\nIf you had said you wanted it to just be you and your husband, that's one thing. Or if you'd said you only wanted your own mum at the birth (understandable). But you even invited your dad the next morning.

Now four months later this entire relationship is fractured.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry to say. I completely understand not wanting visitors and you're not wrong for that. Of course you would only want people around you who can support you. But the parents aren't wrong for asking to visit and their request shouldn't be upsetting you to the point that you've barred them from seeing their grandkid for 4 months. Sure, maybe you don't want to see them, but why can't they visit your husband and see the baby then? You are using the baby as a bit of a weapon at this point. All they did is ask to visit as they were excited.\n\nI do think they suck a little for saying it's an issue that they couldn't visit in the hospital. They were probably just excited though and maybe they didn't understand. I still don't think that should equate to such a reaction. Also they shouldn't have turned down the offer to visit the next day, but people are allowed to feel hurt and not just want to run around as you click your fingers. I also say this as someone who is currently due to give birth any day now and have in laws who are excited to visit as soon as they can. I get it though - it's exciting! So I'm going to make myself as available as possible to them, so they can get some baby cuddles in. And if it gets too much, I'll go upstairs to rest and my husband can host.", "YTA.

Your in-laws have been petty, but it sounds like the whole thing has gotten out of hand. If this situation is making you feel upset, things won't improve until the situation is 'normalised', and you and your husband's relationship with his parents improves. If I were in your shoes, I'd bite the bullet and invite his parents over to meet your daughter, or at least find a more comfortable means of them meeting your daughter so that the relationship can become more cordial. Your husband should probably be brokering this, as they're his parents and his relationship with them can probably withstand the difficult conversations needed.\nIn my experience as a father of two, with a wife who endured some really troubling times in the months following our first, negative memories of those first precious months do have a lasting impact, I'd limit the damage now.", "NTA.

I guess I\u2019m not strong enough for AITA lol. But I will talk to my therapist about everything tonight. \n\nThanks so much again, I know I might sound sarcastic in my comments, but I promise I\u2019m not. Im just a person with rock bottom self esteem."]}
