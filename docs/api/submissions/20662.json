I am also quite tall. Because of this, I am a human jungle gym for all of my little cousins. I love this. I swing them around and ferry them on my back. We have a good time. Also, whenever they come over (which isnt very often), I pick them all up individually and tell them they're getting so big while pretending to struggle. I've been doing this for a while. \n\nOne of my little cousins (let's call her Claire) has gotten bit chubby.\n\nMy mom is getting married in less than a year, so her sister's family (sis, husband, claire, and their 12 yr old: Braxton) flew in to help plan. (Sister and husband  homeschool, so they can come and go as they please without worrying about excused absences and whatnot).\n\nWhen they came by after flying over, I did my usual song and dance with Claire and let Braxton dap me up (he's in that phase rn). Everything was good, Claire had fun, I had fun.\n\nLater that night, my mom told me that I should be a bit more conscious about using words like 'big' or 'heavy' with Claire since she is getting a bit chubby. I said okay. The end.\n\nA while later, my mom starts with dress shopping and I'm asked to watch Claire and Braxton. They come over, same deal as last time. \n\nThis time, my aunt pulls to the side before they leave and tells me that it's very rude to call her daughter 'big' as she is self conscious about her weight. I apologize and tell her I'll try my best to change my language.\n\nBut, that's not the kid of girl I know Claire to be. She's very confident and loud from what I know, and she's never afraid to be herself. Even so, I don't know what's going on at home.\n\nSo I ask her.\n\n\"How do you feel when I call you big?\"\n\n\"Like I'm growing.\"\n\n\"Really? It doesn't make you feel bad?\"\n\n\"No, why?\"\n\n\"No reason.\"\n\nI asked Braxton about it too. He said she's been the same as ever. I even asked her dad. He said she's not at all self conscious about it, and that there would be no reason to since our family is very body positive.\n\nSo, consensus reached; I change nothing about my behavior during their most recent stop-by with the kids.\n\nThat night, during dinner, my mom tells me I am rude a disrespectful for not changing my language to be nicer to Claire (the kids were in the living room). I tell them all what I had been told and ask her sister where she got the idea that Claire is self conscious.\n\nShe tells me that she was self conscious when she was Claire's age.\n\nAt this point, her husband chimes in and explains that Claire isn't like that and they have been fostering a better environment for her, so Claire is as confident as ever. \n\nI also explain how changing the way I talk so suddenly may make her confused or feel different from her other cousins. Because kids notice things like the way you talk.\n\nI get called disrespectful again for talking back and now I'm grounded.

You tell them all that they are getting bigger and growing up.\n\nIt would be weird if you started talking about Claire differently from everyone else.", "NTA.\n\nUgh, it gets under my skin when people go out of their way to \"protect\" children by forcing the kinds of social discrimination that lead to anxiety.\n\nTelling someone to treat a kid differently not because the child is actually upset, but solely because of the preception that the circumstsnces *could be perceived* as unjust in a particular context --- a context that probably hasn't even entered the kid's awareness yet --- is precisely how you *induce* childhood anxiety.\n\nSo long as you treat all your cousins the same, and unless your cousin indicated to her mom that she felt hurt by your words, your aunt and mom are projecting their own anxieties onto you and your cousin. \n\nYour cousin *will* notice (even if only subconsciously) when you suddenly begin speaking to her differently than her other siblings and cousins. That's how you fuck kids up for life.\n\nIt always amazes the lengths parents will go to undermine their childrens' confidence under the guise of \"protecting\" them.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your mom and aunt sound like whiny projecting jerks.", "NTA\n\nYou are right OP, it would make her feel bad if you started to treat her differently more likely than anything else. I sure hate parents who are projectign so hard onto their kids, that they don' t even see how amazing person they're raising. \n\nWell the kid' s okay and has fun (probably does not even register some slight chubbiness ) so all' s good :)", "NTA. Your aunt is projecting her trauma from experiencing fatphobia as a child onto your cousin. You will have to abide by your aunt's rules in front of her, as she doesn't sound like the type to seek therapy and work through her own issues", "NTA, people aren't inherently self conscious about their appearance, they're taught to feel that way. You're teaching her not to feel self-conscious about her weight by treating weight gain as a sign of growing up, not something to be ashamed of. Her mom is teaching her that it's something to be ashamed of by making it seem like it's bad to be called that.", "How old is Claire?", "NTA, they are pushing their own insecurities and opinions onto the situation. \n\nIf Claire is confident and fine, she\u2019s fine. \nAlso some kids go through a chunky phase before a growth spurt. I was a little porker in the 4th grade and 5th I had a growth spurt that pretty much evened everything out. No exercise or eating habits changed to add the extra chunk and non changed when I evened out.", "NTA Your aunts insecurities are trying to be pushed onto her daughter when the daughter is so confident she doesnt even understand why you asked her that. Your aunt and mom are weird for this", "Nta, you're doing the right thing in trusting Claire. \n. You're big and strong. She can be big and strong too. I think you should start showing her femme Olympic weightlifter and strong women. <3\n\nYou're family means well, but they've been living in a stupid sexist fatphobic culture their whole lives. We all make missteps when we're unlearned toxic bs.\n\nTell your family that you've talked to Claire. Tell them what Claire said, and tell them that you trust and respect her, and that you have a good relationship with her, and trust her to tell you if something makes her \nuncomfortable or is hurtful..and also validate your family. \"I'm glad youre looking out for her. She's cant help but be a healthy, confident person with such a supportive loving family around d her: or something", "NTA and the irony is is the family has done such a good job making sure Claire doesn't have the insecurity yet the aunt is still insecure and projecting it onto a child that is happy and healthy.", "YTA\n\nDo you really think someone who honestly feels uncomfortable is going to out themselves admitting to you that they feel uncomfortable?\n\nThe totally wrong thing you did was talk to her herself and ask\u2026 Are you uncomfortable when I say blah blah blah? You\u2019re putting somebody on the spot, of course they\u2019re gonna say no.\n\nYou should watch what you say because people react differently to it.", "I guess it depends on how you are talking your cousin.  If it's a picking her up and going saying ahhhh, you're getting big than no, you're not the AH.  If you are like looking her up and down and saying damn you big girl lol than yes.   You should never body shame someone but making comments that they are getting bigger normally as kids is more a comment towards aging up than getting fat.  My nephews are very small for their ages, but they are 10 and 8; they are growing fast so if I swing them up they are much heavier than they were the last time I saw them, and I may say something like ooooffff you're getting big, but that's not negative though. I'm not sure if you're being extensive with your comments or not either if you keep on saying she's big that really is a bit unnecessary.  I don't think you should be grounded for having a conversation about this just because you don't agree with your mom, but if she feels you're body shaming, you have to look at it from that point of view.  Did you really get grounded for being disrespectful for talking back or is your mom thinking you are being disrespectful to your cousin by body shaming her in which case the punishment would be justified.", "YTA\n\nThis sounds incredibly, fake lmao. You definitely made up that convo with \"Claire\" for sure, even if other parts of the story have some truth, as that's the most inauthentic exchange with a child I've ever seen written.", "You're NTA, but you're grounded. You could've just done what was asked, and all would've been fine.", "ESH. You for not respecting your aunt\u2019s concerns (it\u2019s her kid, not yours). Your aunt for projecting her own experiences into her daughter. Should your aunt be hyper concerned like that if the daughter isn\u2019t? Maybe not, but better for her to try to monitor the language her kid is exposed to than go in the complete opposite direction and be an \u201calmond mom\u201d who is constantly forcing her daughter to diet and screwing with her daughter\u2019s self-image. Her brother and dad aren\u2019t the best people to ask because guys tend to suck at picking up on body image issues, especially when it comes to family and friends. Doing a mental health check with your cousin isn\u2019t bad, it can let her know you\u2019re here to listen if she does have an issue, but, like someone else said, she might also put on a brave front if she looks up to you.", "YTA, there is a reasonable chance that Claire\u2019s mom is just projecting her own trauma onto the situation and that its no big deal. But also, Claire may not be able to understand how this impacts her or how to express herself to you if she did. That\u2019s why parents get to decide these boundaries. You aren\u2019t the asshole for saying it in the first place, but for directly ignoring an explicit boundary you are. We don\u2019t get to just ignore boundaries of others because we don\u2019t think they are reasonable. Don\u2019t be surprised or offended if she doesn\u2019t trust you to hang out with Claire any more if you continue. That\u2019s entirely the parent\u2019s decision.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You did everything right by asking Claire about it.\n\nIf Claire herself had told you it makes her uncomfortable, then sure, stop.
