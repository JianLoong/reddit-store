She looked furious at this and later texted me that she was glad to know how I really felt (whatever that means).\r\n\nI told some of my friends later, and we did have a laugh about it.

Saying \"that is rude\" is not arguing. \"Hey, I'm finishing my point before you speak\" You just say it and move on. This is literally how people, especially women, handle highly disruptive workplaces. In this case, I think what you thought was criticizing, she meant as teasing. Because you were not being clear, it became more unpleasant for you and embarrassing for her. Teens are generally terrible at handling crushes. You could have saved both of you a lot of trouble and frustration.\n\nLearning to read some signs isn't a bad thing, either. You don't care in this case, but you might the next time a girl is trying to throw signs your way. \n\nShe's also not offended, she's hurt. She's definitely in the kid phase of handling crushes and just lashing out and hopefully for her just grows out of it with time and experience. At this point ignore it, it's not about you there. My guess is the friend who brought up the bluntness at least suspected the crush. Keep him around- that's the guy who's gonna show empathy when you're down too", "Honestly, because both negging and ragging on a crush are just bullying.

You can't change that, and I wouldn't put it as wholly self inflicted because you unwittingly played a part by being dense. It's just what it is. I think why you viewed saying anything as \"arguing\" is you look at arguments where there aren't any.\n\nYou can get defensive, but this isn't an attitude that'll win you any favors in the future, especially with potential significant others. I'm not calling you an AH here, but merely giving you a heads up that this attitude may be popular on reddit, but isn't typical taken well in the real world. A little empathy goes a long way. Take it or leave it.", "I've had some get mad and increase the bullying, some be blatantly confused and not know how to process it, and some immediately get scared because they took me for an easy mark and didn't expect me to call their bluff.\n\nPunching is always a very definitive answer, though. Kudos!", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to be socially aware when another person is socially inept.\n\nShe\u2019s getting defensive too, so why so much sympathy towards one and not the other?

Empathy is under rated \n\nAlso, his choice not to say anything likely escalated way more than saying something here. She seems to have taken that as acceptable. OP is also being socially inept and still doesn't get that.
