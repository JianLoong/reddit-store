I've been talking to my mom about my plans and she got upset with me not wanting to create a guest room for when my parents come to visit.

I said I could buy them a hotel room or I'll just sleep on the couch again, but my mom doesn't care. She's calling me inconsiderate and comparing me to my friends in my cohort that both have a guest room set up for when their family visit. I told her one of them has it because her family is 2.5 hrs away, so they visit often. The other friend regrets setting it up since her family is a lot further and the room isn't getting much use. My mom argues that after everything they've done for me (we immigrated here for better opportunities) they should be warranted to have a space for when they visit. I understand where she's coming from, but I don't want to compromise my own space/sanity for her comfort. She's making me feel shitty about my decision and like an ungrateful daughter.
