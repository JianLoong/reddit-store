I didn\u2019t want to uproot Georgia, therefore they kept the house and I moved into a nearby apartment. My ex was a SAHM, I continued paying all the bills for two years. Currently, I\u2019m still paying only the mortgage. Georgia is now 17 and resides with her mother. \n\n16 months ago I met my now girlfriend. During that time, I purchased a house to get out of my apartment. My girlfriend moved in a few months back. Prior to that, I introduced her to Georgia. As I expected, she had a very \u2018whatever\u2019 attitude. I understand changes such as these are hard for kids to cope with. Since the divorce, Georgia could come and go as she pleased. \n\nSince my girlfriend moved in though, Georgia became obnoxious with constantly trying to run her off and humiliate her. The first incident, Georgia came over one afternoon while I was at work to say when she got home from school the previous day, I was coming out of her mother\u2019s bedroom. She knew this was not true as I had been with her that entire day. I sat Georgia down for a serious reality check. \n\nGeorgia was apparently snooping through our mail, she saw my girlfriend\u2019s DOB. For the record, we\u2019re 13 years apart both divorced with kids. Georgia asked my girlfriend, \u201cSo what do you see in my dad, a caregiver?\u201c One early Saturday morning she came over while we were still sleeping. She had brought empty Depends underwear boxes and stacked them in the living room. When we woke up, Georgia said, \u201cWow, so you wear Depends just like my grandpa does huh?\u201d \n\nThereafter, Georgia would refer to her only as \u2018grams\u2019 or \u2018the old hag.\u2019 The next incident, she used our bathroom, said she \u2018stunk it up\u2019 and used some \u2018old lady smelling cologne\u2019 to mask the odor. It was actually very expensive perfume, Georgia sprayed about 70% of the bottle around the house.\n\nThe final straw happened last weekend. Georgia came over for breakfast. At some point, she took my phone and sent her mother a message that read, \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about you, I want to work things out and get back together.\u201d She deleted the text from my phone. Unbeknownst to me, she had mother\u2019s phone on her. Took a screenshot then deleted the text on her mother\u2019s phone. Tuesday, she sent the screenshot to my girlfriend on her mother\u2019s phone and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I think you need to know.\u201d She then deleted that text as well. \n\nThis nearly caused her to leave, exactly what Georgia wanted. I immediately changed the locks. Before I could speak with Georgia, she showed up and couldn\u2019t get in. She called, we both were pissed off for different reasons. I told her she\u2019s not welcomed at our house until she has a serious attitude change. Her mother called, said I traumatized Georgia, claimed the text incident was a load of shit that never happened (Georgia admitted it). My ex said to be prepared to pay for her therapy, because she\u2019ll need it after I put some tramp above my own child.", "created_utc": 1675630043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10un17c/aita_for_changing_the_locks_on_my_daughter/", "score": 475, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After her mother and I divorced, the relationship didn\u2019t change until I met someone else. Georgia began trying to humiliate, and run off my girlfriend. She used whatever she could against her. Eventually, we both had enough and I changed the locks. No matter how many talks or warnings I gave, Georgia wouldn\u2019t lay off. I think I might be the AH for changing the locks on Georgia because for the last 4 years, she\u2019s always been able to come over whenever she wanted. Now that\u2019s changed, Georgia seemed to have gone off the deep end.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Therapy is a good idea though", "NTA.\n\n17 is definitely old enough to know this behavior is unacceptable. Your solution was definitely harsh, but since your daughter wouldn't listen to reason, I can't see another way you could have stood up for your girlfriend. Besides, it's not like you've permanently banned Georgia from your house and from your life, you just set a clear, reasonable boundary: she is only welcome if she's able to be civil to all the residents of this house.\n\nI do think therapy might be beneficial for your daughter, though. Not because I believe she's \"traumatized\" from the event like your ex says, but because this hostility has to be coming from somewhere and Georgia needs healthier mechanisms to cope with it.", "Damn idk what to even say. Georgia is terrorizing y\u2019all like it\u2019s her hobby. NTA. She\u2019s old enough to know if you push peoples buttons that hard, they\u2019re going to flip. No advice, teens can be insane, hope some other people have some ideas for you but yeah very NTA.", "NTA\nSounds like she DOES need therapy. It\u2019s unfortunate that her mother can\u2019t bring herself around to coparent. What this little girl needs is a united front to stand up to her invasiveness and hostility. She clearly has a cup that needs filling up somewhere, but her aggression isn\u2019t going to do anything but push someone who cares away. How does your new girlfriend feel about all of this? Has she tried connecting with DD?", "NTA.  She's invading your space to act maliciously and needs the boundaries", "NTA. This is messed up man. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to go through this. With the way your ex is talking to you, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s encouraging Georgia to hurt you on purpose. Therapy might not be bad for her though. Just make sure you\u2019re the one that sets it up and explain the situation to the therapist.

That being said, please seriously consider family therapy because there are some serious issues y\u2019all need to work out together.", "NTA. Georgia\u2019s behavior is appalling. Serious changes need to happen in order for her to be allowed again in your home. Your ex should work with you, not against you, unless she was a part of this. In which case she\u2019s also a terrible AH. Therapy should definitely be part of it, but you shouldn\u2019t be the one footing it alone.", "NTA.  Your GF is entitled to privacy, as are you.  And your daughter, who is certainly old enough to know better, is being a bully.  It is appropriate for you to set new boundaries given her recent behavior.  She should also lose her phone privileges for a while, but that would require your ex\u2019s cooperation.", "INFO: What punishmet did she incur for the Depends incident and \"stink up the house\" incident?\n\nPlease inform your ex that it's already clear that your daughter needs therapy. She had the right to visit your home unsupervised and lost it because of her behavior. I don't think that's  necessarily unreasonable.", "At first I thought she was 13 still, but then I saw 17.

Immediately.", "NTA - your daughter can be upset about you moving on, but she doesn't need unfettered access to your girlfriends house, which also happens to be your house.  Her behaviour has been disgraceful - there are no excuses for this.  Her mother isn't much better - but it does sound like she is encouraging it.  \n\nPut a lock on your phones and don't give her any passcodes etc.  I know people think you should always choose your child over your new partner, however, your daughter  doesn't live with you full time, and she is 17 - not a small child.  She is old enough to know better, and she is old enough to be punished for this kind of behaviour.  That isn't rejecting her or choosing someone else.", "NTA, but it seems like Georgia herself is being manipulated by your ex. Hope you can figure things out with your gf.", "NTA change the locks and give her time to think about what she\u2019s done. Hopefully she\u2019ll get over it. If she doesn\u2019t this is on her.\n Live your life with or without her around until she can come to terms with your relationship and either way she should no longer have a key", "NTA. Considering your ex called your GF a tramp and Georgia somehow had access to her mother's phone, are you sure your ex isn't involved? Is this your first serious relationship since the divorce? And does the child support/mortgage stop when Georgia reaches 18?\n\nI think family therapy is a good idea because suspect Georgia, though 17,may be being fed tales about being replaced, her mother left on streets etc and also feeling hurt because this relationship means no chance of parents getting back together.\n\nStill see her but by invite because she is vulnerable, likely hurting but at same time you can't let your GF be abused.
