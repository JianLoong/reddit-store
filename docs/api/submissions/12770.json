Has she had tests for spatial awareness? She just sounds physically incapable for not driving into stuff.\n\nI wouldn't let her drive until she's taken and passed a complete defensive driver's course. Even then I wouldn't let her drive an Alfa Romeo.", "NTA, why is she even driving after all these accidents?\n\nWhere I live she'd have had her license taken off her and she'd have to do the theory and practice tests again.", "NTA.\n\nWoah! She's totaled 4 cars in 9 years?! It probably makes more financial sense for her to not drive. I can't even imagine what your insurance rates must be like to cover an individual with that awful of a driving record.\n\nThen, consider the fact that her inattentiveness could have seriously injured her or someone else. It's reasonable that you don't want her driving your vehicle.", "NTA. 4 totaled cars? If she keep on it is just a matter of time before she kills someone else and/or herself.", "NTA \n\nIf she wants to drive, let her buy her own car and pay for her own insurance, separately from yours.", "NTA.  It would only be sexist if you told her she couldn't drive \"because women can't drive\".  She has proven that SHE cannot drive.\n\nShe wants to drive she can buy a car with her money, pay for insurance with her money and pay to fix the car she will wreck with her money.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re forbidding her from driving for no reason. She sounds reckless and if she is allowed to drive then she risks putting others in danger as well. \n\nShe can get her own car if she wants to drive so bad.", "NTA \n\nYou also can't forbid anyone from driving altogether. You can only not allow them to drive your vehicles. 3 wrecked cars by 25 is pretty bad.", "NTA. I kinda get where she\u2019s coming from. It probably feels controlling, and who likes to feel controlled? BUT she keeps crashing cars and could get seriously injured or even kill someone. I wouldn\u2019t let her drive my car either!", "NTA - she shouldn\u2019t be driving. She\u2019s going to hurt someone.", "NTA.  It would be sexist if you said you don't trust her to drive because she is a woman.  You don't trust her to drive because she's totalled three cars out by the age of 25.  Huge difference.  I wouldn't let her drive my 30 year old Dart if it was the only car I had.", "NTA 4 mangled cars? She's clearly too distracted as a driver to be at the wheel.", "NTA.\n25 and totaled 3 cars? I would not ler her drive mine even if I was \u2018t able to.\nIf she thinks she needs to drive, then she needs to buy her own (cheap) car, but because of her track reccord, it wouldn\u2019t be a good thing.", "INFO - is there a possible medical condition? Does she recall running into these poles? Is it her phone? What is she doing wrong?", "NTA. This isn't sexist. You're not letting her drive because she's a shitty driver, not because she's a woman. She needs to get over herself and go back to driver's ed. She's lucky they haven't permanently revoked her license yet.", "NTA, and I don't see this as a sexist decision. \n\nFrom my perspective, you didn't stop her because she's a woman, or some bullshit like that. You stopped her because she has totalled 4 cars that you know of, and has a horrible track record of not being able to drive well. It's enough that the money spent on these must've been insane, but then to give you shit for not wanting her to drive your car is pretty crappy of her.", "NTA. As a woman, it's not \"sexist\" to not let her drive. There absolutely are a majority of women that have licenses that can drive perfectly fine.  She's proven she's an idiot who can't drive and that has nothing to do with her gender. I mean seriously? She hits fixed poles that clearly didn't leap into her path. Tell her she's sexist when she expects the man to constantly provide her with a car just because he's supposed to be the provider.", "NTA. It's not sexist. She has an extremely bad record with vehicles. She could seriously injure herself or someone else. If it were me, I wouldn't let her drive any car that I owned, until she agreed to take additional lessons or a remedial course or something.  She is not a safe driver.", "Nta since she's a bad driver", "NTA - it's common sense. If anything, get her a beater car that she can drive.", "NTA, I would have stopped letting her drive after the first crash,  she seem to pre-occupied to be behind the wheel.   She needs a bus pass.", "NTA!!!\nIt\u2019s not sexist, there is an economical reason for not letting her drive. Why not sign her up for some driving lessons? She also need to learn that she is not to use the phone while driving.", "Most insurance companies consider 3 or 4 major in a lifetime the \u201cacceptable amount\u201d, granted the first one is usually within the first year.\n\nThis many in such a short period is a slippery slope especially when they are her own fault. NTA, perpetually distracted drivers are probably almost as dangerous as drunk drivers.", "NTA. \nThat was 4 cars she send to the scrapyard.", "NTA\n\nHow does she even still have a license??\n\nSo she'd already crashed on car but she still chose to look at a phone instead of the road?  \nI wouldn't let het drive my car even if it went about as fast as an octogenarian walking a chihuaha and had mattresses stuck to all sides as a safety measure. Just No.\n\nIf she wants a car to drive, she can pay for it herself, but honestly, this woman should not be behind the wheel, ever. She should not be in charge of a moving vehicle.\n\nWhat's next, going off-road & hitting a tree roof-first because she was wondering whether there were breathmints left in her purse?\n\nShe's not just endangering the car, not just endangering herself, not just endangering the people crazy enough to want to get into a car that has her behind the wheel, she's endangering everyone else on the road, on the bycicle path, on the sidewalk, everyone who can be hit when next she crashes. She doesn't even realize that she's going to end up causing the type of human damage that can't be recovered from, no, she hides behind sexism.\n\nWonder how long it'll take her to try the \"you're gaslighting me\" card\n\nI'm worried for everyone everywhere near where you live", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s shown time and time again that she cannot drive. Lol. How kind of you to pay for her alternative transportation. I would make her pay for it, lol", "NTA... most definitely. But what's the saying... 3 strikes.", "She has totalled 4 cars by 25?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I'm with the group consensus here. Your wife needs to take a driving course and get her own car and insurance. She's an adult. If she wants to continue to drive she needs to do it herself and admit that it's her own doing that got her in this predicament.", "NTA.\n\nShe's clearly irresponsible, and unless she's willing to get her own car and pay for the car insurance, she can stay her ass home. I used to be a terrible driver and my car insurance was $300 a month. I didn't realize this because my parents paid for it. They're saints.", "NTA. Is she even eligible for insurance?", "NTA. It's not sexist. She's literally a danger to herself and others. She shouldn't be driving any car.", "NTA - I get why you don\u2019t want her to drive your car but maybe it\u2019s time for her to take some drivers courses and provide her with a used car so she has something less expensive to wreck lol", "That's when you say \"oh! No no honey, don't misunderstand. I don't think women can't drive, that IS incredibly sexist!!\n\nI just think *YOU* can't drive due to wrecking 4 cars\"\n\nNTA", "Lol, sexism. \u201cI only totaled 4 cars, babe!\u201d I\u2019m a woman and I wouldn\u2019t let her drive my car either. I\u2019m surprised you let her drive the third one.\n\nETA - NTA", "NTA. It's not sexist. You don't let her drive because she's a horrible, unsafe driver.", "NTA\nIt'd be sexist if you refuse to let a different woman drive a car because of your wife's accidents.\nNot letting her drive your car because of her accidents is just common sense.", "NTA she should demonstrate she is ready with driving classes, and a good track record in a used safe car.", "NTA, you\u2019re kind and responsible to pay for her Ubers.", "INFO: How much driving experience does she have? Has she considered taking driver\u2019s education classes?", "ES\n\nI don't undertand the langauge 'I wont' be a provider of cars\" - doesn't she work? \n\n'I don't let her drive' - how old is she and has she ever had a vehicle in her own name that she bought and paid for with her own money?\n\nYou have an 'Alpha' but she doesn't even have a Lada?\n\nIts time for this woman to join the adults of the world - get a job and pay for her own car.  Then she can write it off when she likes without her husband restricting her choices.\n\nI don't know an adult woman whose husband makes these choices for her and I don't think I'd respect her if she did", "NAH. I understand why your wife may be upset you don't let her drive, although this really does sound like more of a safety precaution on your part given her history of accidents.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
