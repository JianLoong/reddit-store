You refer to every car as \"my car\" so I need to know why you get your own car, but she doesn't?\n\nWouldn't the problem be solved if you both had cars?", "From all the other drivers out there, thank you. There are enough bad, distracted drivers out there. NTA", "At least she hasn't hurt anyone yet.\nNTA", "Nothing sexist about it. She's a menace to her, you and other road users.  But how do you stop her driving it? She could get  a key made. I'd be noting the mileage, perhaps an extra layer of security.\n\nA compromise might be that she takes and graduates from a defensive driving school, and she pays for her own car. A cheap beater, just in case. \n\nOnce she's proven she can be trusted, then she can drive the Alfa, with you riding shotgun. Then if you're comfortable with her driving, *then* she can take the Alfa out.\n\nNo one but me drives my automotive passion.", "NTA That's not sexism. It's not because she's a woman, it's because she keeps destroying cars. Yikes.", "NTA - It isn't sexist. She isn't a responsible driver. She is a distracted driver who has never allowed her past misadventures to teach her anything. I'd never allow her to breathe on an Alfa Romeo let alone drive it and I am a woman. This isn't an issue of her having some bad luck she has literally 4 single vehicle totals. She is lucky with her habits she hasn't died or killed other people. Like others have previously stated get this woman medically tested.\n\nPerhaps if SHE takes a driving course and SHE purchases her own vehicle, and SHE pays for the insurance for said vehicle and SHE keeps up the vehicle with ALL of its regular maintenance and not wrecks her own vehicle. Then perhaps one day she might earn the privilege of driving someone else's vehicle but just like every other type of loss of trust you have to earn that trust back.", "NTA and it's not sexist if she has a documented history of destroying cars. For her own safety as well as others she probably shouldn't have a license and I can only imagine how expensive your car insurance is after 3 wrecks.", "NTA. But if you can afford an Alpha Romeo, surely you could have purchased a beater as well for her to drive/total. How does she still have a driving license?", "My first thought was \u201cSounds like some serious ADHD there, bud\u201d", "Bad driver is hitting a kerb or weaving because you steered a bit too much/little. This is \u201chow the hell did you get a license\u201d.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m going by UK driving tests, which I know are harder than at least some in the states, so maybe it\u2019s different", "ADHD isn't what made her use her phone while driving.  Maybe the other two.  But let's not absolve her of personal responsibility entirely here.", "My sister literally backed straight into mine just the other week. Just saw my car, hopped in theirs, and didn't even look in the mirror/forgot it was right behind, and slammed into it. They've suspected ADHD but no formal diagnosis.", "Honestly it sounds like she has untreated sever adhd  or other neurological disability. That is not typical behavior in an adult.", "It's a very similar process in everything except being told the answers. At least I've never heard of being told the written test answers. Kids of any age can drive on private land all they want, like a farm, for example. \n\nYou have to take a road test to get a license, right? Hopefully?", "I hate to be that person, but ADHD really can do that, especially when wife is only 25. ADHD brains engage in dopamine seeking behaviour, even when doing so is problematic. More, ADHDers are less mature than their peers, on average 5 years according to some experts, meaning their decision making brain regions are both underdeveloped and lacking in/unable to properly use key neurotransmitters. Saying it's a matter of personal responsibility is like saying that a person with glasses is at fault if they can't see well, or a diabetic is at fault for not producing insulin, except that ADHD is worse in that it's still massively underdiagnosed in women and many adults face a lot of stigma when seeking a diagnosis. Further, lots of women are misdiagnosed with anxiety, depression, or BPD, making access to treatment even worse. So where a person in need of glasses or insulin can easily access care and has easily identifiable symptoms, a lot of women with ADHD don't know they have it and have a difficult time accessing care.", "I agree", "ADHD did not force her to not put it in her purse before driving.", "No, but since ADHD impacts decision making regions of the brain, it does directly impact situations like this", "adhd seems to be the cause for everything on this sub", "NTA let her buy and total her own car. Why is it on you to supply her cars? Maybe if she pays for it she will be more careful.", "NTA. But get her tested for ADHD, she may require medication to have the focus to drive safely. Might also be solely her fault, but ADHD might play a role.", "NTA it's not sexist...its safe-ist and smart-ist. Let her buy herself her own car and she can do what ever she wants with it", "NTA, she's sexist for assuming it's sexist because she knows she can't drive worth a damn and knows damn right it has nothing to do about her gender. Making all women look bad right there.", "NTA. Been in a similar situation, taught my girlfriend how to drive stick. It's my only manual car, I love it to death. \n\nShe promptly drove my Megane into the wall on her first solo trip. She doesn't drive my Megane anymore. I don't even drive it. I bought a Twizy, highly recommended to get around town!", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry but she is a danger to herself and others when she gets behind the wheel of a car. She should not be allowed access to drive a toy car. Get her some help, defensive driving classes (yes plural) and a bicycle.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s not sexism it\u2019s her lack of skills. She has a track record that might be worth highlighting to her again, as I don\u2019t doubt you already have. At this point it\u2019s self preservation. Letting her drive you car again is Einstein\u2019s Insanity; \u201cInsanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\u201d", "Nta\u2026. I a woman personally don\u2019t let anyone drive my car I\u2019m sorry but if I spending a fortune on a car if anyone wrecks it it\u2019s going to be me I\u2019m a super careful driver (14 years driving no accidents or bumps) \u2026. Tell your wife to get a job and buy her own car if she has a job she can either save up or take out a loan oh and pay for her own insurance", "NTA  Remind her that you like knowing she's alive and not putting other drivers or passengers at risk for their lives.  Seriously.", "She sounds dangerous, lucky she hasn't hurt or killed anyone yet.", "Honestly, a menace. Just for the good of society don't let her drive again without a lot of driving courses; it seems like she could kill someone quite easily.", "It\u2019s the phone.", "Her choice of food doesn't endanger other people. OP not letting her drive is just him ensuring the safety of his wife and everybody else on the road. It has nothing to do with sexism, bad drivers are bad drivers regardless of gender.", "Well, I'm assuming they were old cars, so scrapping them is no problem, so there is no point in calling insurance for a payout of any kind. It is better to sell it at a scrap yard and keep your insurance record clean.\n\nAdding: unless they hit another car. Which OP says it's mainly just poles and a ditch. No other car was ever hit. So they should pretty much be able to make clean getaways. Possibly. The ditch one seems to have been somewhat serious.", "Agree. Personally i dont text and drive for that reason alone. I end up paying too much attention down at the phone than the road. So I just wait till I get home or if it's important I will pull over to send a reply. Or at a red light and it's a simple sentence response needed.", "ADHD has nothing to do with being distracted by a phone and ending up in a ditch that\u2019s just stupidity", "I wonder how useful this is when she runs over someone with her undiagnosed illness. She has had 3 serious accidents and hasn't had a moment of introspection. While it's good to be understanding, this is clearly a case of attempted murder if she kills someone behind the wheel.", "I agree she shouldn't be driving. I'm not arguing that at all. I'm simply disagreeing that \"ADHD doesn't cause...\". She may not even have ADHD, I don't care either way. She's a very dangerous driver no matter the reason", "It's not. Not everyone who makes mistakes has ADHD. Not everyone who thinks they have ADHD has it. But when it's mentioned there are often people responding in ways that make it clear that more education is still needed.\n\nEdit: typo"]}
