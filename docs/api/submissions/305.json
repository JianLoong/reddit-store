Two days ago I was visiting some family and they all went to bed fairly early so in the evening I had the time to call and talk to him on my phone. I\u2019ve been feeling left out by my irl friends (we've been friends for years and spent every Halloween together so far) for a while now especially now that they all had Halloween plans since they all got into relationships and found new uni friends (I haven't been able to find my kind of people at uni yet). I told him about that while crying.   \nHe started laughing at me and saying that I'm being dramatic and silly cuz there\u2019s no reason for me to feel like this since they\u2019ve been making plans for new years and included me in them. \"How can u be feeling lonely and left out when I call you everyday\". Keep in mind he is going with like 6 of his friends for a weekend trip for Halloween, so he has plans. That kinda ruined my mood and it felt like i can't complain about anything without him telling me that it's all in my head and that i can't feel lonely if i get to talk to him basically everyday.  \n\n\nMaybe like an hour later i was complaining about not really having much to do other than looking at him playing on his PC. He started telling me to leave call and go do something else since i was bored and \"he's not gonna be sat there entertaining me\".  \nI told him that I don't have much to do and I'd rather stay in call with him even if he's playing, but he kept telling me to leave if I'm bored over and over again and at that point I started getting annoyed with him and so I told him to enjoy his trip and disconnected.\n\nMessaged him a little bit after that if he's done being weird and if we can chill in call without him trying to kick me out and he was mad at me for hanging up?? \"oh yeah i moved your hand\" and he told me that he doesn't want to talk to me if I'm just gonna fall asleep when he usually doesn't have an issue with that.\n\nIt makes no sense to me why he'd me mad at me for that, later he said he wasn't, but was still salty about it through his messages.  \nI mentioned today that i don't appreciate him calling my feelings silly. He told me that i'll be over it by the time he'll be back from his trip and that I'm being weird for no reason. So am i the asshole here? I feel like I'm mad over nothing but similar situations have happened in the past where he'd tell me to leave and then he's get mad at me when I do.", "created_utc": 1667232111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yig4o8/aita_for_leaving_call_after_my_boyfriend_told_me/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What are you getting out of this relationship when it seems like you aren\u2019t even getting basic empathy and support from him? I\u2019m older than you and I\u2019ve been on both sides of similar situations, so I can empathize with both of you. It is draining and easy to get frustrated when your partner is relying heavily on you alone for emotional support and entertainment. At the same time, I totally know how you feel and how hard it can be when you\u2019re feeling lonely to not depend heavily on this relationship/connection that you already have. But please trust me when I say that your life will be so much better if you take more time to invest in yourself and other potential relationships around you. Friends will come and go, it\u2019s on you to maintain existing connections while putting in the effort to make new ones so you don\u2019t ever find yourself totally isolated. It\u2019s not easy, but if you don\u2019t at least start trying harder and actively spending less time sitting in call with your LDR boyfriend who doesn\u2019t even seem to want you there, I guarantee it will only get worse. Wishing you the best.", "NTA.", "NTA, just tell him you told me to disconnect so I did.", "NTA\n\nBut\n\nYou need hobbies and friends. Your life should not center around your BF. You need to learn to meet your own needs so you're not codependent on a guy.\n\nAnd your BF should be sympathetic and validating, not laughing at you and saying it's all in your head. If he tells you to hang up, and you hang up, then he has no right to be mad. He should say what he means instead of playing games.", "ESH, who falls asleep in the middle of a call and then gets upset when the other person doesn't want to participate? Listening to someone complain about being bored and do nothing about it is annoying af. His attitude towards your feelings isn't great either, but idk why either of you is bothering, this isn't working out well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You deserve better.", "ESH, you both have a stank attitude. You're both passive aggressive and neither of you really made an effort to consider the other's perspective or genuinely communicate.", "YTA. You call and spend the time complaining and SLEEPING??? And then you tell him YOU are bored? I was bored just reading this.  Maybe he is bored listening to you whine.
