I'm hearing you talk about baking something special for 2 brothers. What are they cooking???", "NTA - this was an honest mistake. One I\u2019ve made in the past as well.\n\nIs this a fairly recent diagnosis? Maybe your brothers just finding it hard to adjust at the moment.  I have a 4 year old niece who\u2019s coeliac and this time of year is a nightmare explaining she can\u2019t have a lot of the cakes and cookies other kids do.

That's not something a normal human being throws a fit over.\n\nAsk him what he's prepared for YOU or other members of the family.

Maybe your sibling is mourning the loss of some favorite comforts. The things that seal in those warm fuzzies. \n\nCould the family tradition change moving forward?  I was asked to participate in soup potluck and bring a gluten free dairy free vegetarian soup\u2014I usually do keto and am closer to carnivore than vegan. I was asked because people know I make really good food. I wasn\u2019t happy and buying a bunch of ingredients (carb loaded) cost me a bunch but I obliged and the vegan soup was a big hit.  \n\nMaybe asking for a bit of modification and recommended recipes or if they cook well they can share what they like. It\u2019ll lead to more inclusion.  You weren\u2019t the AH OP. \n\nShoot I was 16 and also forgot my uncle had a gluten allergy. I was trying to help make chicken soup for dinner as the adults were doing estate things and was mid making dumplings when all the adults came home and started panicking because I forgot the allergy. We pivoted, took some base soup away and made his with rice. Everyone lived that night.", "NTA, but it sounds like your brother regularly feels like he is excluded due to his dietary issues.

You didn't just hand him an apple and say here, deal with it.", "I don't think you're TA as it was an honest mistake. But you have 2 brothers who can't eat regular cake, and only have regular cake available. If you want to continue this tradition with them, you do have to change things up to include them. Like commit to a vegan glutten-free cake, make a variety of cupcakes for all, have everyone bake their own smaller cake, or end the cake thing entirely and just spend time together. \n\nBecause he does have a point that he's been excluded, unintentional as it was.

Why can\u2019t he make or buy his own?", "Nta, I can't imagine ever yelling at anyone over cake. The brother needs some therapy or anger management courses", "NTA\n\nGive him the Yule Log recipe and point him at the kitchen.", "nah .... unfortunately nearly everything on this planet has gluten its a cheap alternative used to bulk out food products i have a wheat gluten allergy i work long hours i spend half of my life planning what food i can eat/bring with me because i also have an allergy to animal products (meat and dairy) and while there is ALOT of naturally gluten free alternatives in this world they are not often used   \nfor example i work in hotels and every meal contains meat dairy and some type of gluten and if they make rice they put soy sauce in it which also contains gluten so its quite mentally exhausting ...if i get hungry i cant just grab something you most likely caught your brother off guard after a long day being hungry and not being able to eat   \ni got stuck in the airport once ... all of the vegan options contained gluten all of the gluten free options contained meat and dairy ... i was stressing out because imagine being pulled aside by customs when your hungry ... they will make your life a living hell", "Nta.  Why do you have to do all the baking? If he's vegan, then he should make a vegan cake.

What has he cooked?", "NAH.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t set out to deliberately make something your brother couldn\u2019t eat but from his point of view I can see why he is upset - you\u2019ve made a special effort to cater to your other brothers dietary requirements even though he has made a choice to be vegan and could eat the same as everyone else if he wanted to however when it comes to this requirement which he does not have a choice in you have forgotten to cater for it.  Your suggested solution basically means he doesn\u2019t get to participate in your family tradition in the same way as normal.  It may seem like a small thing however I\u2019d be willing to bet he is already feeling a little down about all the things he can\u2019t have that he used to enjoy (as someone who has discovered they have both gluten and dairy intolerances this year, believe me when I say many of the free from alternatives out there are just not the same) and is wondering how this will impact his Christmas so this is just one more on the list.  It sucks for him but a simple memory slip doesn\u2019t make you TA.", "NTA. Making a separate dessert for one brother was accommodating, but doing the same thing for the other brother isn't? What? I wouldn't make anything else at all. If he wants to be entitled then he's entitled to cook for himself.", "How about a new tradition that your brother brings dessert?\n\nAnd depending on his medical issue a dessert made in a kitchen where wheat flour is in use (making mince pies and cake) could put him at risk anyways.\n\nNTA.", "YTA - but it seems like an honest mistake at first. Your refusal to make a second - all inclusive dessert is what makes you the TA. \n\nMy son was just diagnosed with Celiac's. I cannot tell you how much my family are tripping over themselves trying to make sure that they are accommodating him.
