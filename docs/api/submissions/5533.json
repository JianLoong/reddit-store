After suffering with health problems for a few years, he was told that he may have a gluten allergy. Not a major one but one where he should avoid eating it. \n\nBefore I made the cake, I was making some pastry for mince pies and as he doesn\u2019t eat them, I decided to just use normal flour.

He said he\u2019s going to be left out of the tradition now as he won\u2019t be eating the same cake. \n\nI told him that the other brother also wasn\u2019t eating the cake but this seemed to make things worse as he pointed out how I accommodated one brother but not the other. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve ruined Christmas a little bit now. AITA?\n\nEdit: I just wanted to say that I don\u2019t know all the ins and outs of his health. All I know is that he\u2019s been told to avoid gluten, as well as several other foods.

Maybe your sibling is mourning the loss of some favorite comforts. The things that seal in those warm fuzzies. \n\nCould the family tradition change moving forward?  I was asked to participate in soup potluck and bring a gluten free dairy free vegetarian soup\u2014I usually do keto and am closer to carnivore than vegan. I was asked because people know I make really good food. I wasn\u2019t happy and buying a bunch of ingredients (carb loaded) cost me a bunch but I obliged and the vegan soup was a big hit.  \n\nMaybe asking for a bit of modification and recommended recipes or if they cook well they can share what they like. It\u2019ll lead to more inclusion.  You weren\u2019t the AH OP. \n\nShoot I was 16 and also forgot my uncle had a gluten allergy. I was trying to help make chicken soup for dinner as the adults were doing estate things and was mid making dumplings when all the adults came home and started panicking because I forgot the allergy. We pivoted, took some base soup away and made his with rice. Everyone lived that night.", "NTA, but it sounds like your brother regularly feels like he is excluded due to his dietary issues.

You didn't just hand him an apple and say here, deal with it.", "I don't think you're TA as it was an honest mistake. But you have 2 brothers who can't eat regular cake, and only have regular cake available. If you want to continue this tradition with them, you do have to change things up to include them. Like commit to a vegan glutten-free cake, make a variety of cupcakes for all, have everyone bake their own smaller cake, or end the cake thing entirely and just spend time together. \n\nBecause he does have a point that he's been excluded, unintentional as it was.

Why can\u2019t he make or buy his own?", "Nta, I can't imagine ever yelling at anyone over cake. The brother needs some therapy or anger management courses", "NTA\n\nGive him the Yule Log recipe and point him at the kitchen.", "nah .... unfortunately nearly everything on this planet has gluten its a cheap alternative used to bulk out food products i have a wheat gluten allergy i work long hours i spend half of my life planning what food i can eat/bring with me because i also have an allergy to animal products (meat and dairy) and while there is ALOT of naturally gluten free alternatives in this world they are not often used   \nfor example i work in hotels and every meal contains meat dairy and some type of gluten and if they make rice they put soy sauce in it which also contains gluten so its quite mentally exhausting ...if i get hungry i cant just grab something you most likely caught your brother off guard after a long day being hungry and not being able to eat   \ni got stuck in the airport once ... all of the vegan options contained gluten all of the gluten free options contained meat and dairy ... i was stressing out because imagine being pulled aside by customs when your hungry ... they will make your life a living hell", "Nta.  Why do you have to do all the baking? If he's vegan, then he should make a vegan cake.

What has he cooked?", "NAH.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t set out to deliberately make something your brother couldn\u2019t eat but from his point of view I can see why he is upset - you\u2019ve made a special effort to cater to your other brothers dietary requirements even though he has made a choice to be vegan and could eat the same as everyone else if he wanted to however when it comes to this requirement which he does not have a choice in you have forgotten to cater for it.  Your suggested solution basically means he doesn\u2019t get to participate in your family tradition in the same way as normal.  It may seem like a small thing however I\u2019d be willing to bet he is already feeling a little down about all the things he can\u2019t have that he used to enjoy (as someone who has discovered they have both gluten and dairy intolerances this year, believe me when I say many of the free from alternatives out there are just not the same) and is wondering how this will impact his Christmas so this is just one more on the list.  It sucks for him but a simple memory slip doesn\u2019t make you TA.", "NTA. Making a separate dessert for one brother was accommodating, but doing the same thing for the other brother isn't? What? I wouldn't make anything else at all. If he wants to be entitled then he's entitled to cook for himself.", "How about a new tradition that your brother brings dessert?\n\nAnd depending on his medical issue a dessert made in a kitchen where wheat flour is in use (making mince pies and cake) could put him at risk anyways.\n\nNTA.", "YTA - but it seems like an honest mistake at first. Your refusal to make a second - all inclusive dessert is what makes you the TA. \n\nMy son was just diagnosed with Celiac's. I cannot tell you how much my family are tripping over themselves trying to make sure that they are accommodating him.

If they mess up an ingredient, I\u2019m always understanding. It is really difficult to prepare these things when it\u2019s not the norm for you.  It\u2019s really hard to accommodate me because most gluten free flours and breads include flaxseed, and honestly flax reacts faster than wheat for me. \n\n*NAH*. Mistakes happen.

I don\u2019t think there is a judgement that really fits how I feel about the situation. But, since I have to pick one to not be flagged, I\u2019ll have to go with ESH. \n\nI\u2019m trying to decipher what you wrote about the allergies. And it seems like one of two things is happening. When you say he \u201cmay have a gluten allergy\u201d, that is not the correct terminology. Doctors would perform a blood test or skin test to confirm or deny that statement, there is no maybe. And they certainly wouldn\u2019t say \u201cmaybe they should avoid eating it\u201d. That\u2019s something people who are allergic to stuff have to test for themselves to find their own limits, for instance with stuff like oils and lecithins made from their allergens. Doctors, due to fear of being sued, would just tell you to not eat your allergens. \n\nThus, either you haven\u2019t taken the time to understand the seriousness of allergies. Which considering allergy modifications are needs, versus wants in a lifestyle choice in veganism, does make me feel negatively towards your choice to deal with making modifications for the latter first, despite using the wrong flour being an accident. The other option is that your brother is actually only intolerant to gluten, but is saying he is allergic. If that\u2019s the case, then I could see where he got his rhetoric from. And that would actually make him the jerk since food allergies and intolerances are not the same of seriousness. \n\nThat being said, he is still an adult, and while I understand his hurt as someone with multiple food allergies, I agree that ultimately if he wanted something that fits then it is on him. However, he is also right that you did prioritize a want over a potential need. You did not, and I repeat, did not, ruin Christmas due to that though.
