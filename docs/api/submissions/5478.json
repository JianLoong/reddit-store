We moved a few years ago to a bigger house in the same neighborhood. Because it's a bigger house my daughter can now have her own full bathroom, and me and my husband share another one. \n\nThe bathroom my daughter uses' shower broke so we just took the opportunity to get a full remodel. My husband and I found furniture we liked that complimented our bathroom and was also a good nice theme I wanted. We got a paint color that we knew my daughter liked pretty well.\n\nOur remodel started a few days ago. My daughter and I were out of the house staying at a friend's while my husband worked from home in the basement. My daughter told me that she was stressed out because she didn't know what was getting put in the bathroom. I told her she was no where as stressed as I was because this isn't her house and her money. She then proceeded to tell me she was upset that she didn't get to have a say in what was happening in \"her\" bathroom, and she didn't know if she'd like the bathroom. I told her it was my house and that we put a color she liked, which she said wasn't what she wanted. I told her she was being spoiled and she shouldn't think she gets to make all of the decisions. She said I wasn't being fair and that I was making the bathroom she'd \"be using\" all about what I wanted, but she'll graduate soonish and then I'll still have the bathroom. She claims she just wants a comprimise, but why should I comprimise how I make MY house look?\n\nMy husband hasn't really weighed in on this, but AITA? I'm pretty sure my child is being entitled.", "created_utc": 1671837468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztvlk5/aita_for_not_letting_my_teenage_daughter_weigh_in/", "score": 6064, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First you make it a competition about who is more stressed. Then, you flip out when she tells you how she felt about being left out of the bathroom remodel. You immediately assume she wants to make all of the decisions. You refuse to even consider what she means by compromise. And your process is strictly about when she is out of the house. \n\nYou seem very aggressively against your daughter having any feelings or say in what is happening in her home. Yes, it is your house. You own it. But she is 14 and for her this is simply home. Why are you so angry about your daughter trying to express that?", "Depends on what she expects to choose. Things like the paint and shower curtian could be her choice and easily changed when she leaves. If she's expecting to choose fixtures and flooring that's another thing.", "INFO - is she getting to at least have a say in how it\u2019s decorated - shower curtain/rugs, etc? I can understand not including her in the furniture/plumbing/counters/etc, but she\u2019s old enough to decorate her bathroom space as she likes. My parents let me choose the rugs/towels/shower curtain when I was a teen.", "Could you make a compromise by shopping for some accessories that she gets 100% say on.  (And you can shove in a closet once she leaves.)", "YTA, for your response. If your daughter had some completely crazy suggestion like \"put fur on the bathroom walls\", you certainly wouldn't do it, but maybe what she wants aligns with what you want, but you haven't even bothered to listen to her opinion. \n\nNo, instead you made it very clear that YOUR home does not belong to HER. Like, she's a teenager, she lives in this house, she's YOUR daughter, even if she didn't pay anything on this property, at this stage of life, this is HERs too, the only home she's ever known. \n\nHonestly, if my parents made me feel like a guest in our house, it would break my heart.", "While I agree that ultimately the final decision is yours, I\u2019m not sure why you couldn\u2019t include her in the process? \n\nThe main thing I think you\u2019re an asshole for is belittling your daughters anxieties. Yes, your stresses as an adult are more significant in general terms. But she\u2019s not an adult and her stresses are appropriate for a 14 year old. You don\u2019t need to minimize them to make your issues sound worse.", "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure my child is being entitled.\u201d  Well, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re creating a fight you didn\u2019t have to have & wasting a teachable moment. The first thing your daughter said was that she was stressed because she didn\u2019t know what was going into the bathroom. That\u2019s reasonable & your cue to explain the plan & why you made the choices you did. Kids know nothing about home remodeling; that was your chance to teach her, which is your job as a parent. It\u2019s also an opportunity for you to practice listening to her, which seems like a skill you could stand to develop. You could have let her pick the color, a very low stakes decision. Instead you shut her down, dismissed her interest & called her names. YTA", "YTA. You are so needlessly mean to your daughter.\n\nYes, it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re paying for it. That doesn\u2019t give you full reign to be a jerk. She\u2019s right - she\u2019s the one using it day to day, and her being happy and comfortable in her own home is important. What possible harm could there be in letting her get involved? Most parents would be thrilled to have a teenager who actually cares about the space they live in. This could be a great bonding experience even.", "YTA. I don\u2019t get what\u2019s so hard about involving your children in things that also affect them? Sounds like you\u2019re being head-strong when all she wanted was an opportunity at a say.", "YTA. I\u2019m a homeowner with kids. It\u2019s not about letting her choose everything but you could have at least included her in the conversation. You get the final vote but it sounds as if you didn\u2019t even talk with her. This could have been easily avoided.", "How hard would it be to ask her about paint colors and find one you both like? Or even her input on bathmats that can be easily replaced years down the road when she moves out? Does she have the right to dictate what happens? Absolutely not. But she\u2019s your child and an autonomous being, you\u2019d think that you would be so dismissive and could include her in things that affect her", "INFO: I get calling the shots on walls and sinks and stuff but why can't she have any say in things that don't have to be expensive and permanently installed like shower curtains and such? Like general decor she can totally have a slight say in at least right without harming anything and then it's easy to change if she leaves in like 5 years.", "Your house, your rules I guess, but do you have to be so snarky about it to your child? Hey mom, I'm stressed about something. Hey kid, not as stressed as I am since I am the one paying for it. Do you get into these arguments with everyone or just your child who you think is being entitled for claiming space in a house that is apparently not hers and she has no say to?", "She has a point. I mean come on she has to use it.She lives there right atleast for the next 4 years. She\u2019s a member of the family, what\u2019s so wrong about her input, or is it the fact that she might want something your not willing to fork out for? If your giving her her very own bathroom, jeez let her Paint it black for all you care", "INFO: What types of thing does she expect to have input on?", "This is a pick your battles kind of situation. This general attitude is what makes me hate visiting my family\u2019s home after I left it (and even then my parents let me pick my wall colors as a child). So you may not be the asshole in a micro sense but you also should be cognizant of reaping what sow", "YTA - seriously, how hard would it have been to include her in the discussions? You are causing unnecessary conflict and making her feel unwelcome in \u201cyour\u201d home.", "I mean, you do get more of a say, you're paying. \nBut damn, you sound kinda mean.", "NAH but for future reference avoid the \"I'm more stressed bc I'm (insert reason here)\" with your daughter. I'm not saying your wrong for feeling that or acknowledging that your stress may be greater, but that is a great way to teach your daughter that her feelings are less than what ever you feel. \n-signed a daughter who was told this repeatedly growing up and now is riddled with guilt anytime I feel something other than happy", "NTA for wanting to do what you like with your own house. \n\nBut YTA for not being a good communicator with your child. If she signalled she cared about the room, you could have had fun and sat down with her and showed her the chosen colour and asked if she thought it was nice and just\u2026communicated positively. It\u2019s not her house so it\u2019s not really for her to determine, but you can still be inclusive and find joy in it with her. The fact that it seemed to become mutually combative or defensive verbally maybe suggests something. It\u2019s fun as a mother and daughter to design things together or at least talk about it.", "YTA for the severity of your response. You could have told her that permanent features in the property add or detract from value so you would be making the final decisions in that vein. But she could potentially pick out towels, the shower curtain, maybe scented soaps, etc. to make her feel heard and considered. If you want to have a good, respectful relationship long term, lay the foundation now. \n\nMaybe apologize about your abrupt response and offer those small concessions mentioned above. It's never too late to choose kindness.", "\"It's not your house.\" Yikes. Way to make sure your child feels unwelcome in her home until she can move out. That's just something you don't say to your kid. YTA for that line alone.", "That \"  You are nowhere as stressed as I was because this isn't your house and your money\" thing was shitty of you as bashing someone for being stressed (especially a teen) is not a nice thing to do. And it can guilt somebody to feel those feelings. I also think she ought to have a say in her own bathroom, which is her space anyway. So I guess you TA?", "It sounds like your daughter just wants to be included and for you to see her as an adult who is capable of making decisions. You should at least be open to hearing her out before immediately shutting her down and calling her spoiled. Newsflash: if she\u2019s spoiled, it\u2019s directly because of you", "NAH; if you\u2019re doing a full remodel of the bathroom. The structural design and major purchases should be yours. However, it will be a bathroom that your daughter has primary use of, and should be able to style the way she wants (towels, wall art, plants, etc.) these are low cost things that can be switched out easily when the time comes and gives her the creative input she wants. I think a compromise can be reached here.", "Soft YTA. While i completely agree with you that things like the vanity, countertop, faucet, tiles, etc. should be decided on by you, let the girl have some say! Let her pick the paint color, the mirror, the towels, bath mat, and shower curtain. Those things are easy and relatively inexpensive to change if you don\u2019t like what she picked when she moves out in 4 years. \n\nAlso, my mom always made me a part of our home renovations. I mean, she always wound up doing what she wanted, but it was nice going to the stores with her and feeling like my input was considered (even if it wasn\u2019t). It meant a lot, was a great bonding experience, and actually gave me the confidence I now have in renovating/home decor. You\u2019re truly robbing both yourself and your daughter of some really special memories.", "NAH. First off, it\u2019s her home too, so stop with the \u201cmy my my\u201d, I understand you\u2019re the one putting money into it, but you could have more grace about this. Your daughter will be moving out soon enough so major renovation details can remain in your hands. I think a good compromise would be letting her to choose the changeable details like shower curtain or towels or counter implements. Try to have some empathy here and let her have a say on smaller elements at least.", "Wtf??? I couldn't read anymore past the \"it's not her money or her house\" part . Use this as a bonding experience or  teaching experience to tell her about the importance of testing paint and how much work it is to paint even a small bathroom \ud83d\ude33 YTA", "It sounds like YTA. You keep mentioning it\u2019s \u201cmy house\u201d and \u201cmy money\u201d, but until she is a legal adult, it\u2019s going to be her house too. Now, it\u2019s reasonable to have boundaries, but it sounds like you\u2019re entirely dismissive. \n\nShe will be using this bathroom at minimum for 4 more years, possibly longer if she stays with you after 18. Why can\u2019t at least some things be her way then change when she leaves in a few years?", "Yta what is this a pissing game of who is more stressed?\n\nWhen my parents redid my bathroom I got to help. They had final say but I got to help pick wall color. The counter and sink. \n\nIt wouldn't have hurt to involve her in the process. Pick two sinks you like and have her pick between them.", "NTA because I get it, but would it have been the worst to go shopping with her? When my parents remodeled they asked me about the wood, tile, paint, furniture etc. and I loved being included! Ultimately they made the decision, but it was nice being involved!", "I\u2019ll say NAH here, though you could be handling this better. \n\nYes, she will move out and you\u2019ll be left with the bathroom. You\u2019re paying and I think it\u2019s appropriate to make those decisions as the adults. HOWEVER, it would be fair and appropriate for her to choose her decor for \u201cher\u201d bathroom. Let her pick the towels and hand towels, the shower curtain, and the soap dispenser. All of the semi-permanent, expensive stuff is just how you want it, but there\u2019s still a lot of fun and easily changeable choices to be made and that could be something you enjoy doing together", "Maybe part asshole.  She shouldn't get to make all the decisions.  How about one or two decisions for someone who may continue being expected to use that bathroom for another half a decade?", "My parents did the same thing and it grew into resentment. The whole \u2018my house, my rules\u2019 thing was always weird and harsh to me. How about a conversation of expectations from both sides first before anything happens. Why is that so difficult. Teenagers especially need to learn compromise and to take other people into consideration. And they\u2019ll learn that from their parents.", "INFO: Is she allowed to decorate in there while she lives at home? ie shower curtain, bath rugs, towels, toothbrush holder, etc\u2026", "YTA for the way you handled it. I would have felt pretty terrible at 14 if my mom made me feel like a freeloading roommate. Like sure, technically it's \"your house\". If your kid decided to try to pursue legal action to claim ownership of the house, she would lose in court because your name is on the mortgage. But you brought her into this world and put her into this house - couldn't you at least have included her in picking out the non-permanent items, like decor, towels, a cute soap dispenser, anything? That's about the age when I started to attempt to develop a personal style, and I was thrilled to have my mom's guidance when I asked to redecorate my bedroom at 14. You're dismissing your daughter's feelings and missing out on an opportunity to get to know her as she turns into a teenager.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a family house, no? Why would you not consult the family you weirdo", "All i read is my house,my money,my bathroom ,my my my my. You talk like she is someone living on rent in your house and your reasons sound you just want her gone. Selfish af.", "What a missed opportunity to bond with your child. This is something you could have worked on together, and while yes, as the parent you would have final say, it would have been great to at least let your daughter be involved. \n\nI am sure there are things that you both would have liked and agreed on. \n\nI hope you are not treating your daughter this way in other areas. She will be out in the world in only a few years and she needs to be prepared to function as an adult. YTA", "Wtf is it with parents not seeing their kids as a part of a family unit?\n\nYTA. You could easily have involved her in the planning!", "YTA. Your daughter doesn't get any say in where she lives, so why not let her have some input into the space she uses? You could have turned it into a really fun activity for the two of you to plan and pick out some things for the bathroom together.", "YTA. When I was growing up, my parents always asked for my opinion on remodels. Not because they would do whatever I wanted, but because they asked me and their friends and other people they were close to for opinions. It sounds like your daughter is mostly upset because you didn't ask her what she thought at all. If she wanted to paint the bathroom walls black, get black appliances, and tile the floor like outer space (I have been to a venue bathroom like this) then you could have discussed your reasons for not wanting to do that, how you'll live here for a while and remodels are expensive. But you didn't even involve her at all, of course she's upset!", "Soft YTA- would it hurt you physically or mentally to consult her before the process started? It just implies a lack of mutual respect, I'm sure she values your opinion but do you even consider hers?\n\nYou have a budget or an amount your willing to spend obviously. Assuming you have the final say and she didn't go a penny over, WTF was going through your head when you (and it was a decision) decided to just absolutely steamroll any chance of input she might have had. it's done now and nothing can be changed I don't think but remember this- you ARE the asshole and I'd bet you however much your spending on the remodel that it isn't the first time", "I can\u2019t believe this many ppl are agreeing with you. YTA. Your daughter is still her own person with preferences and \u201cyour\u201d home is also her home. She didn\u2019t ask to be brought into this world so the fact that you\u2019re so quick to throw the \u201cmy\u201d \u201cmine\u201d stuff around is so triggering. Is this not her home and somewhere she should feel comfortable and be able to have a say? I moved out of my parents the second I was able to bc I was tired of feeling disregarded and like a guest.", "\"but she'll graduate soonish\" she's *fourteen*, she's not graduating for like three years. Why are you already making plans for your daughter to move out?\n\n\" I told her she was no where as stressed as I was\" Competing with your teenager for Most Stressed. Classy.\n\n\"my house my house my house\" We get it, you own the house.\n\nYTA just for your attitude. You definitely sound like the kind of parent who doesn't knock on their kid's door because technically it's not their room, it's *your* room. She wasn't asking to make all the decisions, but you didn't even share your choices with her? Like, \"Look this is the sink we chose, this is the showerhead,\" etc.? Just show her what you picked, it's not that hard. She *will* \"be using\" it (btw why is that in quotations?), you can at least show her what it's going to look like. But no, gotta pull a power move and make sure she knows whose house it is.", "YTA. It doesn't sound like she's asking for complete control over what the bathroom will look like, she just wants to know what's going on and to have some amount of influence over a space that she will be the main user of for the next few years. There's things like shower curtains, decorative towels, soap and toothbrush holders, etc. that you could let your daughter choose to feel like she has some say in the space and yet will be easy to change to what you want once she's moved out. She'd be entitled if she wanted to make all the decisions about the space, but it sounds like she's just asking to make a couple decisions and trying her best to work with you on that.", "YTA.  For not even listening your daughter.  It\u2019s takes almost no effort to listen to her ideas.  I\u2019m not saying you had to follow her vision but you should have at least listened to her.  \n\nI hate this attitude you have about YOUR house.  Nothing good can come from treating your daughter like she is an inconvenience at YOUR house.", "Soft YTA for how you handled the conversation, not the decision itself.\n\nWhen renovating a house, this heavily can impact resale value, something a teenager won\u2019t know or care about. As such, major renovation decisions should 100% rest on the parents.\n\nThat being said, \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d is never a good parenting strategy. You could\u2019ve kindly explained why certain decisions would be left to you and your husband while ALSO providing some small decisions to your daughter that wouldn\u2019t affect the resale value and could be easily fixed/changed later.\n\nBy all means, choose the fixtures and what kind of shower tiles will be used. Let her choose the shower curtain, the color of the hand towels and floor mat etc.\n\nYou definitely could\u2019ve involved your daughter and helped her feel included and valued while ALSO maintaining control of the final bathroom look for the most expensive decisions.", "YTA. Your daughter basically just wants to be heard and you got angry over this. Making it a competition (you can't me more stressed than me) was an immature response as well. \n\nIt is your house and your money, but it doesn't cost anything to listen to her. And don't you want this to be her home as well?   \nYou don't need to follow her suggestions at all, but it's such a simple thing to listen.", "so ... i agree with other posters that the ultimate and final say in the bathroom decor is yours. that isn't the issue.\n\nwhat makes YTA is that unless your daughter is graduating early or something, she still has four years in the house. i feel as though maybe a compromise approach would've been better here.\n\nmaybe she picks out the bath mat and you pick out the shower curtain ? or you just share ideas ? something along those lines might make her feel more a part of the remodel, especially since for the next four years it's hers to use.", "YTA, it wouldn't hurt one bit for you to include her in the decision making process and you also missed a great opportunity to teach her about budgeting. You can keep veto power. My mother was not a good mom (she admits this) but we were encouraged to have a say in household decisions. I remember specifically getting new carpet she vetoed one of us kids choices because this carpet will show stains and look bad in a month, but we had a say and learned things you don't learn in school. Same with grocery shopping, here is your budget make a dinner we will all eat.", "NAH-Your husband is smart not to weigh in.  Bottom line is your house, your money, you do what you want.  If your daughter isn't a part of your home and is just living there with an expiration date, then it makes sense not to ask her opinion.  However, if she is apart of the family and valued, then it shouldn't make any difference if she paid for the bathroom, a towel or tissue she is using a space as a member in your household. Even if you don't go with an idea she has, at least letting her have a voice that is heard goes a long way in her feeling a part of the decision making for things that directly impact her.", "Granted it's your money and house....but shouldn't everyone have a fair share in the home they live in? Why isn't it ok for her to.have some input on a room she is using as well? No compromise now....don't expect her to make compromises later on in life when it comes to her visiting and coming home for Christmas when she has her own family.", "YTA: While yes, it is your house and money, it is *also* her home. As your child, your house is her house as well, therefore she feels like she has a stake in what her areas in the house look like. She is only 14 meaning that for at least the next four years that space will be 'hers' (even though yes you financially own it).  You should have empathy and try to see things from her eyes. That being said, your daughter definitely could've gone about things in a better way. I cannot fault her too much for this because she is a teenager after all. I don't know about you OP but I remember being a teenager: the struggle of figuring out who you are as a person, growing into an individual, and as an extension of that wanting to make your space well... *YOURS*. Let her have a say, after all you can change things to your liking when she is gone and she is the one who is using it", "YTA - the whole my house my rules thing doesn\u2019t work well with fostering good relationships with teens", "YTA for not even including her in the discussion. You could have had a conversation to say \u201chey come shopping with us. Would love your opinion. Just remember that you will graduate in a few years and we will be in the house a long time after so we may not pick the same thing you would like.\u201d \n\nYour way just told her her opinion didn\u2019t matter and hurt her.", "Mostly NTA, but you could offer to have her help pick the shower curtain, throw rug(s), etc. Those are super easy to change out if they are not your taste. That might help her feel more ownership of \"her\" bathroom.", "YTA, it's your house and your money, but I don't understand why you wouldn't include your daughter in the process. She is going to live with you for years to come, and will be using the room exclusively. She's your kid, why are you being so petty? Letting her chime in and pick out a bath mat and a shower curtain, things easily replaceable and don't last forever, are little gestures that would make her happy. Like, it sounds like you don't even like your kid and want to do things with her. She's not your roommate, or your tennant.", "YTA, yes it is your house and money but would it really hurt to at least consult with her, ask her for input or advice etc so that she feels valued and respected. You can make the final decision but let her be part of the process.", "Soft YTA, but you could have let her pick out the temporary features, like paint, shower curtains, towels, etc. It's not hard to repaint one bathroom. You turned it into a very negative experience for her, when it could've been something to bond over.\n\nEdited for spelling and clarity", "Why did you put \u201cbe using\u201d in quotes like that? She will be using it? \n\nShe has another four years until graduating and probably another couple years (at least) after that before she will be completely out of the house. That house is her home. It\u2019s not entitled for her to want input on an area of her home that only she is using right now and for at least a few years to come.", "NTA but I agree with a lot of previous people that ask that maybe you let her help pick out some new towels and some new curtains for the shower and then that way when she leaves in a few years you can change it to whatever you want and it's not a big redo. That way she can at least feel like she has a say in the bathroom that she's going to use until she moves out.", "NTA but cut her some slack. She's only 14 after all. Maybe she wants to experience some independence and that's why she's wanting some input in the bathroom remodel. Maybe you can compromise on things that are easily changeable like d\u00e9cor and paint color? By saying its *your* house and she'll graduate soon, I feel like you're subtly alienating her.", "YTA, so you didn't even involve her at all? Will she just have to wait and see what you picked out when it's done? \n\nYou could have easily involved her. Pick 2 paint colours you like, and have her choose between them, same with the furniture. This way she feels involved and you don't come off as a massive tw*t.", "NTA. It is your house and your choice BUT would it kill ya to let her give her input? You pick two things you like and let her have the final say. You win because you still picked both thing. She wins because she was included. Is it that hard?", "Nta Well....let her know that most bathrooms she will have after she moves out won't look as nice and she will have to figure out how to make it look nice on her own with a very tight budget. Because it's a bathroom. You shower and use the toilet in it. You're not sleeping in it, you're not studying in it. It's a bathroom.  And I've had my fair share of ugly and dirty as heck bathrooms to deal with and make it presentable for myself and others.", "YTA you said it was \u201cmy house\u201d which indicates it\u2019s not her house, too. You see where she might be upset?  You should want your daughter to feel comfortable in HER home, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you care. If you want your daughter to disappear as soon as she\u2019s 18, you\u2019re driving down the right road.", "YTA Why not let her choose the paint colour and some towels and accessories, things that are easy to change once she moves out? Sounds like she just wanted to be involved and it could have been fun for you both to choose things together", "YTA not for not letting her have a say but for the way you communicated it", "I think you\u2019re an asshole for not even asking her opinion, but my family had a big open door policy and if it was anything that dealt with us like our rooms or bathrooms we had an input. Was just a respect thing for my family.", "NTA - you're paying for everything. She's 14, her interests come and go. Her favorite colors change, etc.\n\nBut I would give her the option to decorate it as she would like. Like you don't have to stock it but only for the necessities.

That\u2019s pushing it. She will get over it. When I was her age(10 years ago), my parents redid our bathroom and they picked a color they knew we\u2019d like and we did. I didn\u2019t throw a temper tantrum wanting a say. I knew it wasn\u2019t my home. I\u2019m just grateful they let me pick out the paint in my room. But if by it want to compromise, let her have a say in the paint color. That\u2019s not permanent and can be changed. Give her two options that you approve of. The expensive more permanent stuff can be a nonnegotiable", "YTA. Way to make her feel unwelcome in herown home.  I can only assume you plan to kick her out of YOUR HOUSE as soon as she's 18.  Jeez, how hard would it be to let her be a part of the paint color selection? To let her pick out a few items?  You are coming across as very controlling and selfish.", "YTA\n\n\nU said you picked a colour she liked.  But she disagrees.\n\n\nSo you picked a colour that you looked, and assured yourself that she also likes it", "NTA", "Nta. I would be pretty annoyed in your shoes too. My partner and I are remodeling and the kids know they don\u2019t have a say. They had a say in their room, certainly, but not the bathroom/kitchen. It\u2019s enough trying to make decisions between 2 people, let alone 2 people and children. \n\nThere\u2019s a nice way to handle it though: maybe let her pick out some non-permanent accessories and accents.

It\u2019s going to be ok. She\u2019ll mature and realize she was wrong.", "YTA. Why are you being so dismissive of your daughter instead of just talking with her about it? I don't understand why you're refusing to acknowledge her thoughts and feelings when it would change nothing to just ask her opinion on things? And why choose a color you thought she'd like instead of just asking her? Obviously you don't need to model the entire room based on her opinion, but letting her have some voice on something easily changed like paint color wouldn't hurt you at all and would make her happy, especially since you've told her that it's her bathroom.", "YTA for the way you communicated with your daughter.  You invalidated her feelings.  She\u2019s stressed but she can\u2019t possibly as stressed as you are.  She\u2019s 14 and needs a parent that will listen to her.", "NTA.  \nIt's not her room. It's yours. She's just living in it.   \nNot to say that it's okay to go in and rummage through her stuff, that's something else entirely.  \nBut it's not her bathroom, and the fact that she has a bathroom to use exclusively is pretty friggin' sweet, regardless of what it looks like.", "Very soft YTA. Telling her it isn't her house is pretty harsh but honestly, I don't recall ever having input on the renovations and decor at my parent's house when I lived there, other than my bedroom. \n\nAlso, what a privilege to have your own bathroom. If she \"doesn't like it\" I'm sure there is a gas station or 7-11 nearby with a restroom she can use.", "NTA. you own the house, it\u2019s your money, she\u2019s a kid that gets a bathroom she doesn\u2019t have to share with anyone. i hope you can rein in her entitlement before she moves out from under your roof.", "I might be in the minority on this, but YTA. You're technically correct that it's your house and your money,  but remember who will pick your nursing home.", "Yes YTA!!!\n\nI get it that it is your house and you should get to choose the major things like layout but, things like color and decor should have come from your daughter.

I just finished a major remodel of my home - bathrooms, kitchen, office/\n\nMost adults don't get any say in the bathroom of their home anyway because they move in and whatever is there is there.\n\nAlso with due respect to your daughter, you wouldn't necessarily do a bathroom based on the taste of a 14 year old because you want a bathroom that is relatively timeless and most 14 year olds don't have mature taste. My teenager bedroom was not what I would want as an adult and frankly some of the furniture I bought even in my 20's was not my taste as it matured and got better.\n\nYou can still personalize \\*her\\* bathroom by stuff like towels, pictures, shower curtain - unless it has glass enclosures.", "YTA if she has no say on how HER bathroom is going to look like.", "Super NTA.

Good lord, all the Y T A comments seem to forget that we don\u2019t need to compromise with kids/teenagers on everything.

We moved a few years ago to a bigger house in the same neighborhood. Because it's a bigger house my daughter can now have her own full bathroom, and me and my husband share another one. \n\nThe bathroom my daughter uses' shower broke so we just took the opportunity to get a full remodel. My husband and I found furniture we liked that complimented our bathroom and was also a good nice theme I wanted. We got a paint color that we knew my daughter liked pretty well.\n\nOur remodel started a few days ago. My daughter and I were out of the house staying at a friend's while my husband worked from home in the basement. My daughter told me that she was stressed out because she didn't know what was getting put in the bathroom. I told her she was no where as stressed as I was because this isn't her house and her money. She then proceeded to tell me she was upset that she didn't get to have a say in what was happening in \"her\" bathroom, and she didn't know if she'd like the bathroom. I told her it was my house and that we put a color she liked, which she said wasn't what she wanted. I told her she was being spoiled and she shouldn't think she gets to make all of the decisions. She said I wasn't being fair and that I was making the bathroom she'd \"be using\" all about what I wanted, but she'll graduate soonish and then I'll still have the bathroom. She claims she just wants a comprimise, but why should I comprimise how I make MY house look?\n\nMy husband hasn't really weighed in on this, but AITA?

At the end of the day you might have wound up doing exactly what you wanted to do anyways but she would have been part of the entire process.\n\nWe remodeled all three of our kids rooms 8 months ago.  Not only did we get input of an 11F, 15m, and 16m and allow them to help decide what we were doing but they were all a part of wiring it, installing insulation, sheet rocking it, building new closets, etc.  skills they will be able to use in the future and at the end of the day they got to see the budget and the total costs involved in the project.

She's at the age where she needs to learn more about decision making, understanding how much things cost, what goes into certain things, etc, etc.\n\nYou could have involved her, but you choose not to. Not only do you choose not to, but you're specifically excluding her. You aren't just not involving her, you're refusing to involve her. She doesn't have any clue what is even going on *in her space*.\n\nYour child isn't some houseguest. She lives there. Is this house hers as well or not? Do you want her to feel like this is a family home? Or not? Cause right now, it's not. This is her space too. Despite your grandstanding.\n\nThis was a great opportunity to teach her a lot of things. How much owning a house costs. How much remodeling things costs. How there can be unexpected delays and increases in price. How to handle dealing with contractors (which teaches her how to handle hiring people, how to potentially handle conflict). How to make choices about things. Learning how to balance a budget on a project. All of these things come from higher concepts too. Communication. Coping skills. Negotiation skills. Etc etc.\n\nLiterally all things she needs to know in the future and many things that come in handy in the work force. And yet, you purposefully excluded her. You didn't have to give her sole control, but you could have asked her input and showed her how decisions were made. Child psychology says one of the most important things you can do is involve kids in what is going on in your life. They want communication and to feel involved. You're **purposefully** doing the opposite. For what reason, I have no idea.\n\nThat's just me pointing out what you've robbed from this experience. I'll nitpick a few things you said here.\n\nStop minimizing your daughters feelings. Don't say shit like \"you're no where near as stressed\". How the fuck do you know? lol. Imagine being kicked out of the only space you have, while also having no clue what is going on with it or what is being done with it. Imagine being completely in the dark about your entire living space (remember, the bedroom and bathroom are her only sole living areas). Saying shit like this is just so dismissive and rude. You have no idea the level of stress she is under (from your own actions, by the way). And I doubt you ever will, given your poor levels of communication.\n\nAlso. \"She'll graduate soonish\". She'll graduate **in four years**. That is not soon, you realize that is 1/3 of her life already, right? First, it sounds like you're already want her out of the house. Gross. The house should always feel like a safe space for your children. She's not going to graduate soon, and for those **four years** she will have to live in that space. Shouldn't she feel happy and like she was included in decisions about her space? That's rhetorical by the way, yes, she should.\n\nAsking to be involved in decisions about her space isn't entitled. It's perfectly normal. Especially at her age. You missed out on a great opportunity to teach her a lot of great things. To help her make her own place more hers. And to bond with her.\n\nSo yes.

As an adult I don\u2019t spend any time at her house and neither do my sisters really. family events are typically at my house where I am careful to make everyone feel at home. I\u2019ve already negotiated two bedroom makeovers for my kids that they get to take point on with my husband. I want them to feel at home here forever.", "Seriously.\n\nOP: Remember this moment well. When she never calls in 15 years tops, there's a good chance it's a key one.", "Horrible thing to say.\nIt\u2019s not her house but it\u2019s her home though!", "And her daughter was being the mature one, even asking to compromise", "How could the daughter have gone about this in a different way. I mean she went in with a very minimal request of, please tell me about how the bathroom will look after the renovation not knowing is stressing me out, and got that thrown back in her face, if she can\u2019t even ask what her bathroom will look like without getting shit from OP what hope does she have?", "So you didn\u2019t even read the post. \n\nLiterally all the daughter did was ask to be included. That *is* the compromise. \n\nOp told her to fuck off.", "This does have the mouthfeel of the way a stepmother treats an unwanted stepdaughter in cliche movies", "probably can't wait to give her the boot as soon as legally possible. \n\nmy parents weren't great but holy shit am i glad they weren't like that.", "Also probably r/InsaneParents", "I agree. I also think she could have thrown a bone to compromise by picking out new towels and accessories with her daughter", "Exactly. This could have been a fun activity for them to share. \"Hey, I'm thinking of one of these 3 colors. Do you love or hate any of them more than the others?\". \"Wanna go look at faucets?\". \"Do you like this mirror or that mirror?\". You don't have to give the kid final say or full control but narrowing down options can be such a fun shared experience. Making your teen feel like their voice is heard can strengthen a lifelong bond. \n\nSuch an easy and wasted opportunity because OP is a control freak.", "She's 14 years old. She won't be gone \"soon.\" 4 years is an eternity when you're 14.", "That statement about the daughter being gone soonish is a HUGE red flag, considering she's 14. 4 years is a long time, especially in childhood development. It makes it seem like she's counting down the days before she leaves.", "I remember, back when I was her daughter's age, my dad was remodeling the kitchen. Unpromted, I said what I thought would be better, but instead of trying to shut me up... He realized my idea was much better than the plan, and it got done following my suggestion. \n\nShe's a fucking asshole to not even take the time to listen to her. I wonder how much she just refuse to listen when her daughter talk.  Probably not a lot recently because she knows it's a waste of time.", "It may be OP's house, but it's the daughter's home. OP is doing a fabulous job ensuring that her child will no longer feel that way. Some mother...\n\nYTA.", "It seems that parents like yours are not uncommon (based on your post and others).  To me it is mind-boggling....  crazy you had to grow up through that level of micromanagement.", "because parents like op don't love their children as people they love them as extensions of themselves", "Yeah this! Even if OP doesn't want het daughter to be involved in the choices (which is crazy, it is always possible to include her opinions even if its just for the towels, minor decorations, etc), at least tell her what's it gonna look like.", ">day after graduation\n\nThat's awfully generous of you. I'd bet same day immediately after the graduation ceremony. Happy Graduation, here's some boxes, gtfo :)", "With as much venom and contempt I picked up from OPs post, I bet everything she never wanted kids. OP sounds so bitter and jealous of her own daughter to the point she looks at her like an enemy instead of as someone it's OPs job to protect and care for (both emotionally and physically). These are the types of moms who raise kids that basically cope with narcissistic abuse even if OP doesn't have NPD. She hates her daughter and seems very set on making sure she shows it in every way possible.", "Nah many parents love having their kids stay home while going to school or while saving up for a place of their own. \n\nThe parents that are militant about pushing the kids out at 18 in this day and age are just assholes.", "My son is 28. He stayed with me after he graduated college for several years.  I loved having him at home.  His girlfriend moved in too.  They were so fun and appreciated everything.  They eventually moved out into their own spot together.  If I was wealthy I'd build a big house where they could have their own space but we'd all still get to live together.  I miss them but they were ready to move out.", "That was my thought.", "My mother was like OP. It was HER house, you would be leaving soon, your opinion means nothing.\n\nExcept she also had me do a tonne of the work. I stripped so much paint back to wood and wallpaper, painted whole rooms, furniture, and hung shelves.\n\nI was six when we moved in. I\u2019ve earned money at painting and decorating as a student. Had it been easier to do an apprenticeship as a woman back in the 90s I would have. I ended up a make up artist instead. I was obsessed with paint charts and had favourites!\n\nMy BF remodelled this year and I was utterly useless at anything involving structural stuff. He bless him spent months tracking down a shower easier for me to use with our height difference (well over a foot) and my disability. But he was baffled by \u2018aesthetic\u2019 and was shocked to discover I knew so much about paint, plaster and happily stripped his lower stair bannisters back to plain wood from gloss paint when he was away for a weekend. Rented the hot torch and had a fantastic time. We don\u2019t live together. Nor had this come up in out eight years of living in different houses.\n\nIt did absolutely melt my head realising my mother was such an AH to tell a 6 year old you\u2019ll move out soon and force them to use incredibly strong chemicals and a hot torch to scrape paint. I see where I got my petty streak. She was setting me up to fail but I liked to kill her with kindness or excel at pointless skills to make her look bad.\n\nWe are NC. And only as I was stripping stairs did I think \u2018I did a huge amount of the work as a child to reno that beautiful Victorian house and when she sold it in the last property bubble, she didn\u2019t even loan me money because I was *homeless*\u2019 She did such a number it\u2019s taken 8 years NC, 15 years since she sold and nearly 40 years to realise she ripped me off so royally instead of \u2018oh well at least I learned tonnes.\u2019\n\nIt does still boil her piss all these things helped me get away from her. Which is why OP wants her daughter helpless and reminded how unwelcome she is or your plaything to bully can escape\u2026", "That\u2019s such a good point. A huge part of GOOD parenting is nurturing the parts of their child that will allow them to connect to other people. The lesson OP is teaching her kid is that those with more power get to bulldoze and steamroll those who have less \u2014 that their thoughts, opinions, and feelings don\u2019t matter. \n\nIt\u2019s really horrifying. Why the hell do people like this have kids?! Oh, right. So they have someone weaker than them they can bully and feel superior to. Few things I respect less in the world than shitty parents. I can\u2019t stand people like OP.", "With this kind of parenting, she'll be gone for real. This is the kind of relationship that ends up in no contact. I hope the poor girl can form a solid support network outside her (immediate) family.", "See, I love the color pink, but wouldn't consider myself especially feminine or girly. I'm a mix of a lot of traits, basically I like what I like. The important thing is that I got to express *myself*, not whatever my mom wanted for me. There were a few times we clashed when I was growing up, but it was normal mother/daughter stuff and was always resolved quickly. Unlike your mom, mine understood that I'm me, not an extension of her. \n\nI hope your relationship with your mom is better now, or if not, that you've distanced yourself for your own well being.", "Right? My favorite color is purple but that doesn't mean I want it painted on the walls. Plus there's so many variations on shades it's not like there isn't options to find something they both like", "I was 9 when my parents designed the new house, 10 when it was built, and I had input on my room and the bathroom for us kids. It's our space too, let the kids have some ownership and investment in the space. OP: YTA.", "Seriously,  this could have been a fun mother/daughter project!", "Pick a few colors you like and let her pick from them. Regardless it is paint. Easy to change.", "To me it's mind-boggling that a parent would ask their child's input on things like decor or even family vacations, because that was never part of my life. I sat here nearly crying when I read the posts about parents involving their children in family decisions. \n\nI don't want to go into detail but I grew up never being told about medical decisions that were being made about me, never having a choice in what activities I was being enrolled in, sometimes never being told until the last minute that I was being sent to summer camp or going on a family trip that had been planned for months. When I was 17 my mother forged my signature on college applications for the school she decided I was going to attend. I only learned about it when she announced that I was accepted. She also decided where I was going to work and harassed the manager to hire me.\n\nSo yeah a parent involving their child in family decisions and asking their opinions on things that personally affect them is such good parenting. I guess it's the norm but it seems magical to me.", "4 years for a 14 year old is almost a quarter of her life. Those 4 years are going to feel a lot longer for the daughter than it will for OP. Plenty of time to be reminded that she's barely a guest in her own home.", "I chose wallpaper for my room when I was a kid in the early 80s. It was floor to ceiling dandelions. That neon yellow and green was BRIGHT. I still remember it so many years later. I know my parents didn\u2019t love it, but it was my room so they did what made me happy.", "And indicates pretty well that daughter will be expected to move out the second she turns 18", "I actually went back to double check that it wasn\u2019t a step daughter. There was no sense of connection between them and felt more like something a new step parent who knew they weren\u2019t going to / didn\u2019t want to be a bonus parent to the child would say.", "Daughter has a countdown clock most likely too.", "Probably why \"people know about my main\" and they posted on a \"trash account.\" Ironically /u/hummingbirdsong11 should be the main account since they described it so well.", "They also don't have the skills to understand the feelings they're having and how to communicate them.  If the only way you know how to communicate is to scream then that's what you're gonna do lmao", "[Lunarbaboon](http://www.lunarbaboon.com/) is probably my favourite webcomic artist. The way he  portrays mental health struggles is incredible.", "Amazing, thanks for sharing", "I was hoping you'd end with \"and now I own my own restaurant\"", "Ugh. \n\nJust ugh. Parents that just want to live through their kids are so leech-like.", "They are honestly the worst. I hope OP is getting something from the response to this thread. But somehow I think they logged off after the first YTA and won\u2019t look back.", "My mom died a couple years ago at 99 almost 100.  \n\nI started therapy at the same time I was putting her into Assisted Living near me.  I visited faithfully and dealt with medical appts, etc.  Yet I could not care for her in my wife's and my home -- way too emotionally stressful to me.\n\nI continue to go to the therapist because Mom is present tense inside of me, if that makes sense.  More healing to come.", "I was also a gothy teen too - we compromised because I wanted black walls so I got a very dark blue paint and black sheets.", "I had parents who constantly made me feel like my opinions didn\u2019t matter during my childhood, and even *they* let me choose my bedroom wall color lmao.  \n\nOP is a jerk. Why even have kids if you\u2019re going to treat them like a huge burden? Who do they think they are? Honestly, it\u2019s a really disgusting attitude. I feel so bad for OP\u2019s daughter", "About 50% of people 18-29 are still living with their parents because housing is just wildly affordably, there is a good chance that is going to be the daughters bathroom for a long time to come", "I cannot even imagine what you experienced growing up.  It goes to show that we can live on the same planet, and how vastly different our parents could be.\n\nTo me, my kids are everything.  That does not mean I bow to every demand, of course, I do have boundaries.  My job in life is to do the best I can - to prepare for their future life.  I'm sure my children will at some point have to remodel their own home - why not give them first-hand experience as a child, so when it is time to do it themselves, they have already been through the process?   My job is to teach my kids everything I know, the more involved they are, the better prepared they will be.  \n\n\nOne way or another, life can be hard.", "Somehow I also see this OP trying to defend or deflect as well\u2026. I hope I\u2019m wrong and they recognize their cockup.", "I give my *cat* more input on my conversations and decisions than op gave her daughter, but also, the idea of \u201cincluding\u201d a baby in like, discussions of deep philosophical concepts or major news items is delightfully funny to me :D", "I'm sure your kiddo will feel free to express himself because his mom  delights in his expression.", "It definitely makes sense. For better or worse, the adults we grow up with shape us in many different ways, especially our parents. Much healing and happiness to you.", "One time, when I was in high school, my Mom was feeling bored and just remodeled the main bathroom in a sponge bob theme because she saw me watching it once. \n\nMy step Dad hated it, but I loved the fact she would even do such a crazy thing. It had some of that glue on trim, shower curtains, towels, a decorative soap dish and a pump soap dispenser, shower mat, all sponge bob themed.\n\nTo be all that honest, I wasn't even in to the show all that much, but the time and effort really helped reinforce how much she loved me.", "I got towels three years ago. They were around 30\u20ac each. They kinda are the only ones we use and are in the wash frequently. They are still as good as new and probably still nicer than new but cheap towels would be. If you can invest a little more, it really pays out in the long run.", "Oh I know, I just swapped those in my master bath. But my point is, if you want a cheap, easy way to make kids feel involved... Some neutrals and some timeless/classic pieces for the bug stuff, let them go ham on paint, art, and basically anything that regularly gets removed to get washed *anyway*", "It's wild to me that people make their kids pay rent on a house they own. I think it's a bit different to ask them to chip in if the family lives in a rental, but in a house you own it's not an expenditure", "\"It's your birthday today! I was going to offer you a nice gift, but I decided... you won't have to pay rent this month, but starting the next you'll have to. No rent, that's your gift.\"", "I'm picturing a million rubber duckies molded into the walls with their different hats and characters, rubber ducky light fixtures, rubber ducky water spouts and one of those ***HUGE*** rubber duckies in the tub. \n\nI think I'm going to have a nightmare with this in it eventually.", "Oh yes, how strange, why on earth would you not want to talk to such a nice woman? After ALL she did for you?/s", "One had the nerve to make me a Gigi \ud83d\ude05", "I even had a clear toilet seat adapter that had miniature yellow ducks suspended in blue water.", "One summer my parents redid our rooms and I remember how cool it was. I got lime green walls and a loft bed, although I grew to hate the loft bed because who wants to climb a ladder when you first wake up lol. \n\nMy sister was just entering her teens and got her walls bubblegum pink with like a beaded curtain door and one of those mosquito net things over her bed with string lights in it. Very sassy. It was fun, they did it while we were at summer camp", "The problem might be, that they only get the least expensive towels, so that they might actually start to fray after just a few years. Sometimes investing a little more in quality in the beginning, helps saving money in the long-run. \n\n(Many years ago I needed some summer shoes without any kind of straps around the heal in an emergency situation. My choices were between a 40\u20ac shoe I didn't really like but that would have been fine in the moment, or a 100\u20ac shoe that was just heaven to walk in. I ended up with the expensive one that I've worn for the next 12 years or so, while I wouldn't have worn the other one ever again. So in the long-run it was a good deal, even if it was much more expensive in the moment.)", "This is basically what my parents did. When I was 20 but still living at home they decided to build a new house and start everything fresh; new furniture, new decor, new linens, etc. I picked out a nice shower curtain, rug set, and matching set of towels for my new bathroom and I got to take it all with me when I moved into my first apartment. \n\nMine was an en suite so now my old room has become the primary guest room and the former guest room became a play room for my niblings so it all worked out."]}
