We moved a few years ago to a bigger house in the same neighborhood. Because it's a bigger house my daughter can now have her own full bathroom, and me and my husband share another one. \n\nThe bathroom my daughter uses' shower broke so we just took the opportunity to get a full remodel. My husband and I found furniture we liked that complimented our bathroom and was also a good nice theme I wanted. We got a paint color that we knew my daughter liked pretty well.\n\nOur remodel started a few days ago. My daughter and I were out of the house staying at a friend's while my husband worked from home in the basement. My daughter told me that she was stressed out because she didn't know what was getting put in the bathroom. I told her she was no where as stressed as I was because this isn't her house and her money. She then proceeded to tell me she was upset that she didn't get to have a say in what was happening in \"her\" bathroom, and she didn't know if she'd like the bathroom. I told her it was my house and that we put a color she liked, which she said wasn't what she wanted. I told her she was being spoiled and she shouldn't think she gets to make all of the decisions. She said I wasn't being fair and that I was making the bathroom she'd \"be using\" all about what I wanted, but she'll graduate soonish and then I'll still have the bathroom. She claims she just wants a comprimise, but why should I comprimise how I make MY house look?\n\nMy husband hasn't really weighed in on this, but AITA? I'm pretty sure my child is being entitled.", "created_utc": 1671837468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztvlk5/aita_for_not_letting_my_teenage_daughter_weigh_in/", "score": 647, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First you make it a competition about who is more stressed. Then, you flip out when she tells you how she felt about being left out of the bathroom remodel. You immediately assume she wants to make all of the decisions. You refuse to even consider what she means by compromise. And your process is strictly about when she is out of the house. \n\nYou seem very aggressively against your daughter having any feelings or say in what is happening in her home. Yes, it is your house. You own it. But she is 14 and for her this is simply home. Why are you so angry about your daughter trying to express that?", "Depends on what she expects to choose. Things like the paint and shower curtian could be her choice and easily changed when she leaves. If she's expecting to choose fixtures and flooring that's another thing.", "INFO - is she getting to at least have a say in how it\u2019s decorated - shower curtain/rugs, etc? I can understand not including her in the furniture/plumbing/counters/etc, but she\u2019s old enough to decorate her bathroom space as she likes. My parents let me choose the rugs/towels/shower curtain when I was a teen.", "Could you make a compromise by shopping for some accessories that she gets 100% say on.  (And you can shove in a closet once she leaves.)", "YTA, for your response. If your daughter had some completely crazy suggestion like \"put fur on the bathroom walls\", you certainly wouldn't do it, but maybe what she wants aligns with what you want, but you haven't even bothered to listen to her opinion. \n\nNo, instead you made it very clear that YOUR home does not belong to HER. Like, she's a teenager, she lives in this house, she's YOUR daughter, even if she didn't pay anything on this property, at this stage of life, this is HERs too, the only home she's ever known. \n\nHonestly, if my parents made me feel like a guest in our house, it would break my heart.", "While I agree that ultimately the final decision is yours, I\u2019m not sure why you couldn\u2019t include her in the process? \n\nThe main thing I think you\u2019re an asshole for is belittling your daughters anxieties. Yes, your stresses as an adult are more significant in general terms. But she\u2019s not an adult and her stresses are appropriate for a 14 year old. You don\u2019t need to minimize them to make your issues sound worse.", "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure my child is being entitled.\u201d  Well, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re creating a fight you didn\u2019t have to have & wasting a teachable moment. The first thing your daughter said was that she was stressed because she didn\u2019t know what was going into the bathroom. That\u2019s reasonable & your cue to explain the plan & why you made the choices you did. Kids know nothing about home remodeling; that was your chance to teach her, which is your job as a parent. It\u2019s also an opportunity for you to practice listening to her, which seems like a skill you could stand to develop. You could have let her pick the color, a very low stakes decision. Instead you shut her down, dismissed her interest & called her names. YTA", "YTA. You are so needlessly mean to your daughter.\n\nYes, it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re paying for it. That doesn\u2019t give you full reign to be a jerk. She\u2019s right - she\u2019s the one using it day to day, and her being happy and comfortable in her own home is important. What possible harm could there be in letting her get involved? Most parents would be thrilled to have a teenager who actually cares about the space they live in. This could be a great bonding experience even.", "YTA. I don\u2019t get what\u2019s so hard about involving your children in things that also affect them? Sounds like you\u2019re being head-strong when all she wanted was an opportunity at a say.", "YTA. I\u2019m a homeowner with kids. It\u2019s not about letting her choose everything but you could have at least included her in the conversation. You get the final vote but it sounds as if you didn\u2019t even talk with her. This could have been easily avoided.", "How hard would it be to ask her about paint colors and find one you both like? Or even her input on bathmats that can be easily replaced years down the road when she moves out? Does she have the right to dictate what happens? Absolutely not. But she\u2019s your child and an autonomous being, you\u2019d think that you would be so dismissive and could include her in things that affect her", "INFO: I get calling the shots on walls and sinks and stuff but why can't she have any say in things that don't have to be expensive and permanently installed like shower curtains and such? Like general decor she can totally have a slight say in at least right without harming anything and then it's easy to change if she leaves in like 5 years.", "Your house, your rules I guess, but do you have to be so snarky about it to your child? Hey mom, I'm stressed about something. Hey kid, not as stressed as I am since I am the one paying for it. Do you get into these arguments with everyone or just your child who you think is being entitled for claiming space in a house that is apparently not hers and she has no say to?", "She has a point. I mean come on she has to use it.She lives there right atleast for the next 4 years. She\u2019s a member of the family, what\u2019s so wrong about her input, or is it the fact that she might want something your not willing to fork out for? If your giving her her very own bathroom, jeez let her Paint it black for all you care", "INFO: What types of thing does she expect to have input on?", "This is a pick your battles kind of situation. This general attitude is what makes me hate visiting my family\u2019s home after I left it (and even then my parents let me pick my wall colors as a child). So you may not be the asshole in a micro sense but you also should be cognizant of reaping what sow", "YTA - seriously, how hard would it have been to include her in the discussions? You are causing unnecessary conflict and making her feel unwelcome in \u201cyour\u201d home.", "I mean, you do get more of a say, you're paying. \nBut damn, you sound kinda mean.", "NAH but for future reference avoid the \"I'm more stressed bc I'm (insert reason here)\" with your daughter. I'm not saying your wrong for feeling that or acknowledging that your stress may be greater, but that is a great way to teach your daughter that her feelings are less than what ever you feel. \n-signed a daughter who was told this repeatedly growing up and now is riddled with guilt anytime I feel something other than happy", "NTA for wanting to do what you like with your own house. \n\nBut YTA for not being a good communicator with your child. If she signalled she cared about the room, you could have had fun and sat down with her and showed her the chosen colour and asked if she thought it was nice and just\u2026communicated positively. It\u2019s not her house so it\u2019s not really for her to determine, but you can still be inclusive and find joy in it with her. The fact that it seemed to become mutually combative or defensive verbally maybe suggests something. It\u2019s fun as a mother and daughter to design things together or at least talk about it.", "YTA for the severity of your response. You could have told her that permanent features in the property add or detract from value so you would be making the final decisions in that vein. But she could potentially pick out towels, the shower curtain, maybe scented soaps, etc. to make her feel heard and considered. If you want to have a good, respectful relationship long term, lay the foundation now. \n\nMaybe apologize about your abrupt response and offer those small concessions mentioned above. It's never too late to choose kindness.", "\"It's not your house.\" Yikes. Way to make sure your child feels unwelcome in her home until she can move out. That's just something you don't say to your kid. YTA for that line alone.", "That \"  You are nowhere as stressed as I was because this isn't your house and your money\" thing was shitty of you as bashing someone for being stressed (especially a teen) is not a nice thing to do. And it can guilt somebody to feel those feelings. I also think she ought to have a say in her own bathroom, which is her space anyway. So I guess you TA?", "It sounds like your daughter just wants to be included and for you to see her as an adult who is capable of making decisions. You should at least be open to hearing her out before immediately shutting her down and calling her spoiled. Newsflash: if she\u2019s spoiled, it\u2019s directly because of you", "NAH; if you\u2019re doing a full remodel of the bathroom. The structural design and major purchases should be yours. However, it will be a bathroom that your daughter has primary use of, and should be able to style the way she wants (towels, wall art, plants, etc.) these are low cost things that can be switched out easily when the time comes and gives her the creative input she wants. I think a compromise can be reached here.", "Soft YTA. While i completely agree with you that things like the vanity, countertop, faucet, tiles, etc. should be decided on by you, let the girl have some say! Let her pick the paint color, the mirror, the towels, bath mat, and shower curtain. Those things are easy and relatively inexpensive to change if you don\u2019t like what she picked when she moves out in 4 years. \n\nAlso, my mom always made me a part of our home renovations. I mean, she always wound up doing what she wanted, but it was nice going to the stores with her and feeling like my input was considered (even if it wasn\u2019t). It meant a lot, was a great bonding experience, and actually gave me the confidence I now have in renovating/home decor. You\u2019re truly robbing both yourself and your daughter of some really special memories.", "NAH. First off, it\u2019s her home too, so stop with the \u201cmy my my\u201d, I understand you\u2019re the one putting money into it, but you could have more grace about this. Your daughter will be moving out soon enough so major renovation details can remain in your hands. I think a good compromise would be letting her to choose the changeable details like shower curtain or towels or counter implements. Try to have some empathy here and let her have a say on smaller elements at least.", "Wtf??? I couldn't read anymore past the \"it's not her money or her house\" part . Use this as a bonding experience or  teaching experience to tell her about the importance of testing paint and how much work it is to paint even a small bathroom \ud83d\ude33 YTA", "It sounds like YTA. You keep mentioning it\u2019s \u201cmy house\u201d and \u201cmy money\u201d, but until she is a legal adult, it\u2019s going to be her house too. Now, it\u2019s reasonable to have boundaries, but it sounds like you\u2019re entirely dismissive. \n\nShe will be using this bathroom at minimum for 4 more years, possibly longer if she stays with you after 18. Why can\u2019t at least some things be her way then change when she leaves in a few years?", "Yta what is this a pissing game of who is more stressed?\n\nWhen my parents redid my bathroom I got to help. They had final say but I got to help pick wall color. The counter and sink. \n\nIt wouldn't have hurt to involve her in the process. Pick two sinks you like and have her pick between them.", "NTA because I get it, but would it have been the worst to go shopping with her? When my parents remodeled they asked me about the wood, tile, paint, furniture etc. and I loved being included! Ultimately they made the decision, but it was nice being involved!", "I\u2019ll say NAH here, though you could be handling this better. \n\nYes, she will move out and you\u2019ll be left with the bathroom. You\u2019re paying and I think it\u2019s appropriate to make those decisions as the adults. HOWEVER, it would be fair and appropriate for her to choose her decor for \u201cher\u201d bathroom. Let her pick the towels and hand towels, the shower curtain, and the soap dispenser. All of the semi-permanent, expensive stuff is just how you want it, but there\u2019s still a lot of fun and easily changeable choices to be made and that could be something you enjoy doing together", "Maybe part asshole.  She shouldn't get to make all the decisions.  How about one or two decisions for someone who may continue being expected to use that bathroom for another half a decade?", "My parents did the same thing and it grew into resentment. The whole \u2018my house, my rules\u2019 thing was always weird and harsh to me. How about a conversation of expectations from both sides first before anything happens. Why is that so difficult. Teenagers especially need to learn compromise and to take other people into consideration. And they\u2019ll learn that from their parents.", "INFO: Is she allowed to decorate in there while she lives at home? ie shower curtain, bath rugs, towels, toothbrush holder, etc\u2026", "YTA for the way you handled it. I would have felt pretty terrible at 14 if my mom made me feel like a freeloading roommate. Like sure, technically it's \"your house\". If your kid decided to try to pursue legal action to claim ownership of the house, she would lose in court because your name is on the mortgage. But you brought her into this world and put her into this house - couldn't you at least have included her in picking out the non-permanent items, like decor, towels, a cute soap dispenser, anything? That's about the age when I started to attempt to develop a personal style, and I was thrilled to have my mom's guidance when I asked to redecorate my bedroom at 14. You're dismissing your daughter's feelings and missing out on an opportunity to get to know her as she turns into a teenager.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a family house, no? Why would you not consult the family you weirdo", "All i read is my house,my money,my bathroom ,my my my my. You talk like she is someone living on rent in your house and your reasons sound you just want her gone. Selfish af.", "What a missed opportunity to bond with your child. This is something you could have worked on together, and while yes, as the parent you would have final say, it would have been great to at least let your daughter be involved. \n\nI am sure there are things that you both would have liked and agreed on. \n\nI hope you are not treating your daughter this way in other areas. She will be out in the world in only a few years and she needs to be prepared to function as an adult. YTA", "Wtf is it with parents not seeing their kids as a part of a family unit?\n\nYTA. You could easily have involved her in the planning!", "YTA. Your daughter doesn't get any say in where she lives, so why not let her have some input into the space she uses? You could have turned it into a really fun activity for the two of you to plan and pick out some things for the bathroom together.", "YTA. When I was growing up, my parents always asked for my opinion on remodels. Not because they would do whatever I wanted, but because they asked me and their friends and other people they were close to for opinions. It sounds like your daughter is mostly upset because you didn't ask her what she thought at all. If she wanted to paint the bathroom walls black, get black appliances, and tile the floor like outer space (I have been to a venue bathroom like this) then you could have discussed your reasons for not wanting to do that, how you'll live here for a while and remodels are expensive. But you didn't even involve her at all, of course she's upset!", "Soft YTA- would it hurt you physically or mentally to consult her before the process started? It just implies a lack of mutual respect, I'm sure she values your opinion but do you even consider hers?\n\nYou have a budget or an amount your willing to spend obviously. Assuming you have the final say and she didn't go a penny over, WTF was going through your head when you (and it was a decision) decided to just absolutely steamroll any chance of input she might have had. it's done now and nothing can be changed I don't think but remember this- you ARE the asshole and I'd bet you however much your spending on the remodel that it isn't the first time", "I can\u2019t believe this many ppl are agreeing with you. YTA. Your daughter is still her own person with preferences and \u201cyour\u201d home is also her home. She didn\u2019t ask to be brought into this world so the fact that you\u2019re so quick to throw the \u201cmy\u201d \u201cmine\u201d stuff around is so triggering. Is this not her home and somewhere she should feel comfortable and be able to have a say? I moved out of my parents the second I was able to bc I was tired of feeling disregarded and like a guest.", "\"but she'll graduate soonish\" she's *fourteen*, she's not graduating for like three years. Why are you already making plans for your daughter to move out?\n\n\" I told her she was no where as stressed as I was\" Competing with your teenager for Most Stressed. Classy.\n\n\"my house my house my house\" We get it, you own the house.\n\nYTA just for your attitude. You definitely sound like the kind of parent who doesn't knock on their kid's door because technically it's not their room, it's *your* room. She wasn't asking to make all the decisions, but you didn't even share your choices with her? Like, \"Look this is the sink we chose, this is the showerhead,\" etc.? Just show her what you picked, it's not that hard. She *will* \"be using\" it (btw why is that in quotations?), you can at least show her what it's going to look like. But no, gotta pull a power move and make sure she knows whose house it is.", "YTA. It doesn't sound like she's asking for complete control over what the bathroom will look like, she just wants to know what's going on and to have some amount of influence over a space that she will be the main user of for the next few years. There's things like shower curtains, decorative towels, soap and toothbrush holders, etc. that you could let your daughter choose to feel like she has some say in the space and yet will be easy to change to what you want once she's moved out. She'd be entitled if she wanted to make all the decisions about the space, but it sounds like she's just asking to make a couple decisions and trying her best to work with you on that.", "YTA.  For not even listening your daughter.  It\u2019s takes almost no effort to listen to her ideas.  I\u2019m not saying you had to follow her vision but you should have at least listened to her.  \n\nI hate this attitude you have about YOUR house.  Nothing good can come from treating your daughter like she is an inconvenience at YOUR house.", "Soft YTA for how you handled the conversation, not the decision itself.\n\nWhen renovating a house, this heavily can impact resale value, something a teenager won\u2019t know or care about. As such, major renovation decisions should 100% rest on the parents.\n\nThat being said, \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d is never a good parenting strategy. You could\u2019ve kindly explained why certain decisions would be left to you and your husband while ALSO providing some small decisions to your daughter that wouldn\u2019t affect the resale value and could be easily fixed/changed later.\n\nBy all means, choose the fixtures and what kind of shower tiles will be used. Let her choose the shower curtain, the color of the hand towels and floor mat etc.\n\nYou definitely could\u2019ve involved your daughter and helped her feel included and valued while ALSO maintaining control of the final bathroom look for the most expensive decisions.", "YTA. Your daughter basically just wants to be heard and you got angry over this. Making it a competition (you can't me more stressed than me) was an immature response as well. \n\nIt is your house and your money, but it doesn't cost anything to listen to her. And don't you want this to be her home as well?   \nYou don't need to follow her suggestions at all, but it's such a simple thing to listen.", "so ... i agree with other posters that the ultimate and final say in the bathroom decor is yours. that isn't the issue.\n\nwhat makes YTA is that unless your daughter is graduating early or something, she still has four years in the house. i feel as though maybe a compromise approach would've been better here.\n\nmaybe she picks out the bath mat and you pick out the shower curtain ? or you just share ideas ? something along those lines might make her feel more a part of the remodel, especially since for the next four years it's hers to use.", "YTA, it wouldn't hurt one bit for you to include her in the decision making process and you also missed a great opportunity to teach her about budgeting. You can keep veto power. My mother was not a good mom (she admits this) but we were encouraged to have a say in household decisions. I remember specifically getting new carpet she vetoed one of us kids choices because this carpet will show stains and look bad in a month, but we had a say and learned things you don't learn in school. Same with grocery shopping, here is your budget make a dinner we will all eat.", "NAH-Your husband is smart not to weigh in.  Bottom line is your house, your money, you do what you want.  If your daughter isn't a part of your home and is just living there with an expiration date, then it makes sense not to ask her opinion.  However, if she is apart of the family and valued, then it shouldn't make any difference if she paid for the bathroom, a towel or tissue she is using a space as a member in your household. Even if you don't go with an idea she has, at least letting her have a voice that is heard goes a long way in her feeling a part of the decision making for things that directly impact her.", "Granted it's your money and house....but shouldn't everyone have a fair share in the home they live in? Why isn't it ok for her to.have some input on a room she is using as well? No compromise now....don't expect her to make compromises later on in life when it comes to her visiting and coming home for Christmas when she has her own family.", "YTA: While yes, it is your house and money, it is *also* her home. As your child, your house is her house as well, therefore she feels like she has a stake in what her areas in the house look like. She is only 14 meaning that for at least the next four years that space will be 'hers' (even though yes you financially own it).  You should have empathy and try to see things from her eyes. That being said, your daughter definitely could've gone about things in a better way. I cannot fault her too much for this because she is a teenager after all. I don't know about you OP but I remember being a teenager: the struggle of figuring out who you are as a person, growing into an individual, and as an extension of that wanting to make your space well... *YOURS*. Let her have a say, after all you can change things to your liking when she is gone and she is the one who is using it", "YTA - the whole my house my rules thing doesn\u2019t work well with fostering good relationships with teens", "YTA for not even including her in the discussion. You could have had a conversation to say \u201chey come shopping with us. Would love your opinion. Just remember that you will graduate in a few years and we will be in the house a long time after so we may not pick the same thing you would like.\u201d \n\nYour way just told her her opinion didn\u2019t matter and hurt her.", "Mostly NTA, but you could offer to have her help pick the shower curtain, throw rug(s), etc. Those are super easy to change out if they are not your taste. That might help her feel more ownership of \"her\" bathroom.", "YTA, it's your house and your money, but I don't understand why you wouldn't include your daughter in the process. She is going to live with you for years to come, and will be using the room exclusively. She's your kid, why are you being so petty? Letting her chime in and pick out a bath mat and a shower curtain, things easily replaceable and don't last forever, are little gestures that would make her happy. Like, it sounds like you don't even like your kid and want to do things with her. She's not your roommate, or your tennant.", "YTA, yes it is your house and money but would it really hurt to at least consult with her, ask her for input or advice etc so that she feels valued and respected. You can make the final decision but let her be part of the process.", "Soft YTA, but you could have let her pick out the temporary features, like paint, shower curtains, towels, etc. It's not hard to repaint one bathroom. You turned it into a very negative experience for her, when it could've been something to bond over.\n\nEdited for spelling and clarity", "Why did you put \u201cbe using\u201d in quotes like that? She will be using it? \n\nShe has another four years until graduating and probably another couple years (at least) after that before she will be completely out of the house. That house is her home. It\u2019s not entitled for her to want input on an area of her home that only she is using right now and for at least a few years to come.", "NTA but I agree with a lot of previous people that ask that maybe you let her help pick out some new towels and some new curtains for the shower and then that way when she leaves in a few years you can change it to whatever you want and it's not a big redo. That way she can at least feel like she has a say in the bathroom that she's going to use until she moves out.", "NTA but cut her some slack. She's only 14 after all. Maybe she wants to experience some independence and that's why she's wanting some input in the bathroom remodel. Maybe you can compromise on things that are easily changeable like d\u00e9cor and paint color? By saying its *your* house and she'll graduate soon, I feel like you're subtly alienating her.", "YTA, so you didn't even involve her at all? Will she just have to wait and see what you picked out when it's done? \n\nYou could have easily involved her. Pick 2 paint colours you like, and have her choose between them, same with the furniture. This way she feels involved and you don't come off as a massive tw*t.", "NTA. It is your house and your choice BUT would it kill ya to let her give her input? You pick two things you like and let her have the final say. You win because you still picked both thing. She wins because she was included. Is it that hard?", "Nta Well....let her know that most bathrooms she will have after she moves out won't look as nice and she will have to figure out how to make it look nice on her own with a very tight budget. Because it's a bathroom. You shower and use the toilet in it. You're not sleeping in it, you're not studying in it. It's a bathroom.  And I've had my fair share of ugly and dirty as heck bathrooms to deal with and make it presentable for myself and others.", "YTA you said it was \u201cmy house\u201d which indicates it\u2019s not her house, too. You see where she might be upset?  You should want your daughter to feel comfortable in HER home, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you care. If you want your daughter to disappear as soon as she\u2019s 18, you\u2019re driving down the right road.", "YTA Why not let her choose the paint colour and some towels and accessories, things that are easy to change once she moves out? Sounds like she just wanted to be involved and it could have been fun for you both to choose things together", "YTA not for not letting her have a say but for the way you communicated it", "I think you\u2019re an asshole for not even asking her opinion, but my family had a big open door policy and if it was anything that dealt with us like our rooms or bathrooms we had an input. Was just a respect thing for my family.", "NTA - you're paying for everything. She's 14, her interests come and go. Her favorite colors change, etc.\n\nBut I would give her the option to decorate it as she would like. Like you don't have to stock it but only for the necessities.

That\u2019s pushing it. She will get over it. When I was her age(10 years ago), my parents redid our bathroom and they picked a color they knew we\u2019d like and we did. I didn\u2019t throw a temper tantrum wanting a say. I knew it wasn\u2019t my home. I\u2019m just grateful they let me pick out the paint in my room. But if by it want to compromise, let her have a say in the paint color. That\u2019s not permanent and can be changed. Give her two options that you approve of. The expensive more permanent stuff can be a nonnegotiable", "YTA. Way to make her feel unwelcome in herown home.  I can only assume you plan to kick her out of YOUR HOUSE as soon as she's 18.  Jeez, how hard would it be to let her be a part of the paint color selection? To let her pick out a few items?  You are coming across as very controlling and selfish.", "YTA\n\n\nU said you picked a colour she liked.  But she disagrees.\n\n\nSo you picked a colour that you looked, and assured yourself that she also likes it", "NTA", "Nta. I would be pretty annoyed in your shoes too. My partner and I are remodeling and the kids know they don\u2019t have a say. They had a say in their room, certainly, but not the bathroom/kitchen.

It\u2019s going to be ok. She\u2019ll mature and realize she was wrong.", "YTA. Why are you being so dismissive of your daughter instead of just talking with her about it? I don't understand why you're refusing to acknowledge her thoughts and feelings when it would change nothing to just ask her opinion on things? And why choose a color you thought she'd like instead of just asking her? Obviously you don't need to model the entire room based on her opinion, but letting her have some voice on something easily changed like paint color wouldn't hurt you at all and would make her happy, especially since you've told her that it's her bathroom.", "YTA for the way you communicated with your daughter.

Telling her it isn't her house is pretty harsh but honestly, I don't recall ever having input on the renovations and decor at my parent's house when I lived there, other than my bedroom. \n\nAlso, what a privilege to have your own bathroom. If she \"doesn't like it\" I'm sure there is a gas station or 7-11 nearby with a restroom she can use.", "NTA. you own the house, it\u2019s your money, she\u2019s a kid that gets a bathroom she doesn\u2019t have to share with anyone. i hope you can rein in her entitlement before she moves out from under your roof.", "I might be in the minority on this, but YTA.

I just finished a major remodel of my home - bathrooms, kitchen, office/\n\nMost adults don't get any say in the bathroom of their home anyway because they move in and whatever is there is there.\n\nAlso with due respect to your daughter, you wouldn't necessarily do a bathroom based on the taste of a 14 year old because you want a bathroom that is relatively timeless and most 14 year olds don't have mature taste. My teenager bedroom was not what I would want as an adult and frankly some of the furniture I bought even in my 20's was not my taste as it matured and got better.\n\nYou can still personalize \\*her\\* bathroom by stuff like towels, pictures, shower curtain - unless it has glass enclosures.", "YTA if she has no say on how HER bathroom is going to look like.", "Super NTA.

Good lord, all the Y T A comments seem to forget that we don\u2019t need to compromise with kids/teenagers on everything.

We moved a few years ago to a bigger house in the same neighborhood. Because it's a bigger house my daughter can now have her own full bathroom, and me and my husband share another one. \n\nThe bathroom my daughter uses' shower broke so we just took the opportunity to get a full remodel. My husband and I found furniture we liked that complimented our bathroom and was also a good nice theme I wanted. We got a paint color that we knew my daughter liked pretty well.\n\nOur remodel started a few days ago. My daughter and I were out of the house staying at a friend's while my husband worked from home in the basement. My daughter told me that she was stressed out because she didn't know what was getting put in the bathroom. I told her she was no where as stressed as I was because this isn't her house and her money. She then proceeded to tell me she was upset that she didn't get to have a say in what was happening in \"her\" bathroom, and she didn't know if she'd like the bathroom. I told her it was my house and that we put a color she liked, which she said wasn't what she wanted. I told her she was being spoiled and she shouldn't think she gets to make all of the decisions. She said I wasn't being fair and that I was making the bathroom she'd \"be using\" all about what I wanted, but she'll graduate soonish and then I'll still have the bathroom. She claims she just wants a comprimise, but why should I comprimise how I make MY house look?\n\nMy husband hasn't really weighed in on this, but AITA?

Poor daughter and father.", "Did OP even want to be a mom?", "Agreed. We moved into a much larger house when I was 13 and mom had me involved in all the decisions, looking back idk if she really liked my input or just wanted me to feel included but she had my convinced I had a better eye for that stuff than she did, it felt good", "What's inexpensive and easy to you may not be to others.", "Could have at least let daughter pick a color that she actually liked. That\u2019s easy enough to change later on.  Doesn\u2019t sound like she even likes her daughter that much. OP: YTA", "Yeah, that statement bothered me too. Like once she graduates she\u2019s automatically gone from the house.", "Well said.  I hope OP is receptive to your comment.", "The saddest part (for the daughter) is that she\u2019s only 14 and Mom\u2019s already planning on her leaving soon. Not sure if the legal age is 18, but that\u2019s 4 years away, not in a year or less. \n\nOP, YTA.", "She says her daughter graduates \"soonish.\"  Four years for a teenager is an epoch.  Sounds like OP can't wait.", "My daughter is 30, hasn't lived here in years, but I got her input. She's going to inherit the place, no sense putting in something she hates and waste both our money on something she's just going to demo when I'm gone. \n\nOP is TA. I mean, does she even like her daughter???", "It\u2019s really sad, right? I cannot imagine competing with my daughter over what\u2019s stressful. I own my own business and get very stressed about it. When my daughter comes to me and is stressed because she fell two assignments behind in her school work, I don\u2019t compete with her. I give her a hug and tell her it will be ok and we will get caught up together. You have to let kids have their own anxieties at their own level. They\u2019re learning and it\u2019s part of the process of learning to deal with more difficult things as an adult.", "Exactly!", "> Make a shared experience of this remodel.\n\nWhen my parents were house hunting they brought me along to the majority of the house tours, and always let me at least express my views. They decided in the end, but it was still nice that I was able to make some good points.", "This all day long . You only get to connect to teens when you let them in \u2026seriously this could have been a really fun experience for you and your daughter. She\u2019s starting to to have opinions and thoughts. Embrace it. Apologize and go through some sites together or do a Pinterest board. She will feel heard. You can thank me later\u2026.", "This sort of attitude is nothing more than a power trip over a teenager. That\u2019s pathetic.", "I mean. My parents always paid for the paint/upgrades whatever to my room as a kid because. Well. I was a child. But they understood the fact that, even though I was a child, I lived there too, and allowed me to make my own decorative decisions, within reason, because I lived there and they wanted me to like the home I lived in.", "Right. Children are not allowed to have opinions and preferences! They must bow to us, ever grateful for the scraps we throw at their feet! So ungrateful and so entitled to think they get a say. Who do they think they are? Autonomous beings with real feelings and thoughts? Peons. That\u2019s what they are.  /s", "This is what a normal parent does. One that cares about their kids and wants them to grow into adults that care about the people around them. I think OP doesn\u2019t have those skills sadly.", "Yeh exactly, because let\u2019s face it, kids have enough anxiety in their teenage years as it is, a little input, a little validation, not exactly gonna kill them", "> Agreed, my mom let me choose the paint color, shower curtain, bath mat, and towels for the bathroom that mainly I used when I was 17.\n\nOP thinks that makes you \"spoiled\" and \"entitled\".", "Haha lol no was being sarcastic saying it\u2019s her bathroom her choice, as reference said black lol", "My brother had a black wall that got painted over in white. It just needed a couple more coats than the others.", "I picked my bedroom and bathroom colour when I was 8. The bathroom is still a very beautiful shade of aqua blue. (The bedroom has been painted over several times because I no longer live there.) I would gladly let any children I have pick the colour of any room that they primarily use, as long as I can veto.", "I typed out like three versions of this response. OP just isn\u2019t gonna get it. Daughter might enjoy the book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents in a few years though", "If someone tells you their worried and your response is \"not as worried as me\" you're an asshole. More if the other person is your daughter. More if the other person tryes to explain why they're worried and you are dissmisive.\n\nOP could have validated her daughter feelings and explained why they are doing the long-lasting decisions, but she didn't. She went for the dissmisive and rude rute.\n\nEdit to add: you NEVER tell a minor that it isn't their house. They don't have anywere to go, they can't even go away if they wanted. It IS their house.", "I don't think OP is an AH but I also don't think you need to own a house or have kids to know that being included feels good! Sure, they don't *need* a 14 year old's opinion, but why wouldn't you want your kids to feel like their opinions matter??", "agreed, particularly considering daughter's age. 14 is plenty old enough to pick out towels or something IMO", "It\u2019s not going to be over a one time incident, if this is OP\u2019s attitude, it\u2019ll continue in other facets of their relationship.", "I seriously doubt this is a one time incident.", "If this is a sample of what OP is like all the time, she'd certainly be justified.", "You new to reddit or something????? Have you read these other communities especially with kids who grew up and set boundaries with parents for stuff worse than this....she's 14 now....what about when she's 16 or 18", "She could let her have some input. It\u2019s just paint", "The kid didn't ask to design the bathroom.", "That's a great compromise because paint is pretty easy to fix later on down the line. I'm not saying she should get a say in major things just a couple of minor things and I think a paint job would be another great way to let her have some say no space she's going to use for the next at least 4 years.", "Exactly! Why the competition? When she said \u201cno where stressed as I was because this isn\u2019t her house and her money.\u201d like yeah she\u2019s probably stressing more than her but belittling her feelings is not the way to go. I\u2019m sure it is not hard going tile picking or smth getting her opinion and saying \u201cno this one works better\u201d atleast she HAD an input.", "You know what I mean \ud83e\udd23", "Paint is a lot different than bathroom fixtures", "I don't where people get the idea you get a say in how someone renovates their home.\nHer daughter is entitled.", "Same, I was always involved in so many things when I was young. From choosing the design for remodels, and the actual remodelling or helping out at my dad's farm. \n\nI was often asked for input and I was praised for good ideas or being handy. \n\nMy whole adult life I have always been confident in doing my own renovations, repairs, decorate and plan a room. It certainly played a big part in developing many important, practical life skills and I'm glad I had the opportunity to learn like that.", "OP just moved to a large house and decided to remodel the bathroom instead of just doing a repair. I get the impression in 7 years OP will be able to afford to replace a towel rack, a faucet and a couple of cabinet knobs.\n\nSure, maybe I'm wrong, but I think ~150 is a reasonable risk to have her daughter feel empowered. If OP is worried about it however, she can lower the overall budget for those things by $100 and put it in savings so she can afford the change in 7 years.", "For real. Get neutral hard fixtures (tub, shower surround, shower doors, shower head, faucet, etc) and add color with paint, rugs, towels, art...  All of which is easy to change whenever", "And what if she ends up needing to stay at home past 18? Will OP say, \"Nope, sorry, times up!\"\n\nYTA", "Poor kid", "Yeah. She\u2019s counting the days. My daughters 10 and the other day I thought about how it\u2019s \u201conly\u201d 8 more years until she\u2019s an adult and may move out and it made me sad. I can\u2019t imagine wanting it to come faster.", "More nonsense.", "Yes, but it was your bedroom. I pointed that out before: the room in question is a bathroom. If it was her room, then no question, she should have a say. \nBut we are talking about a bathroom.", "So true. And a lot of things are really out of their control so giving them something that they can actually have input in and a positive outcome can be really important at that age.", "Golly everyone on here seems to think kids don't get to feel like the house they live in is their home. What a world view.", "When they said fixtures they weren't talking drawer knobs they were talking the actual vanity or light fixtures.  \n\nDrawer knobs and towel racks are mere incidentals, not \"fixtures\"", "Someone clearly loves looking in the mirror.", "What\u2019s the absolute worst that would happen if she includes her daughter in the conversation?", "I don\u2019t understand why the fact that it\u2019s a bathroom is so crucial and relevant to you. OP even said it\u2019s he daughter\u2019s bathroom. Regardless though, what\u2019s the issue with her having at least some input on common space?", "Children do not have to be included in absolutely every matter. Sometimes, they have no say.\nShe is not going to need therapy because her parents didn\u2019t let her pick a bathroom sink.\n\nSometimes, parents are allowed to say no. It is a full sentence.", "A bathroom tile will be there for 15 years, if not longer. You have to decide about something that probably will be there if you sell the house. You have to decide about how easy the bathroom is to clean, if you want to follow fashion or want it to be neutral because you might want to sell, you have to decide about durability. \n\nThe color of the towels or the shower curtain are decisions a teenager can make, not the permanent ones like a complete remodel.", "You dodged the question.\n\nNo, they don\u2019t need to be included in absolutely every matter. No one is saying they do. But if she wants to be involved, what\u2019s the harm? I can only think of positives that would come from it.", "I hadn\u2019t lived in my childhood bedroom for 3 years before my mom repainted it but she still let me help out pick out paint colours cuz even though she was selling the house it was still my room and yea OPs daughter is a child but she can still be a part of decisions when it comes to her spaces (her bedroom and what is technically her bathroom)\u2026 it\u2019s called being a decent and respectful person", "Okay, and? Give her guardrails and a budget.", "She clearly already feels entitled and it would entrench the feeling further.\nShe is learning a lesson, and that lesson is \u201cno.\u201d", "Children don't need to be a part of every conversation or decision. It's not a power trip for the adult to remodel a bathroom to their own taste, not their child's. Kid is lucky to have her own bathroom. \n\nA kid won't have psychological damage because they don't have input on eve. This is ridiculous. My house, my decorations. Kids can pick the paint color for their own bedrooms.", "She is 14. \nRemodelling a bathroom involves decisions most adults find hard when it\u2019s not only the paint and the towels. It\u2019s not about budget only, or just colors. Where do you put the fixtures, what kind of lights, is the plumbing still ok with this new shower, are these tiles easy to clean or do you need a special soap? Will they break easily or stain? Does the electricity need some update for these new features we chose?\n\nDo let let your 14 year old fix your car or choose insurance?", "You have an insanely low bar for \u201centitlement.\u201d She is not acting entitled at all.\n\nOP is the type of mother who\u2019s going to be back here in 5 years asking why her daughter doesn\u2019t come visit her anymore.", "I already said that children don\u2019t need to be a part of every conversation, literally at the beginning of the comment you just replied to.\n\nIt is a power trip for an adult to talk to their children in the way the person I was replying to suggested.\n\nI agree that a kid won\u2019t have psychological damage because they don\u2019t have input on everything. That\u2019s not the issue. The issue is OP making it very clear that it\u2019s OP\u2019s house which is why she gets to make the decisions - and a 14 year old is smart enough to get the implication that it\u2019s not *her* house because she doesn\u2019t get to make decisions."]}
