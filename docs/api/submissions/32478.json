The only course of action that is completely justified is that OP controls his comfort and that is exactly what he is doing.\n\nAlso to those of you accusing OP of giving his parents an ultimatum when it comes to choosing their children. They actively made a choice to exclude her. They also made a choice to leave her return into his hands which he declined. However, he gave them a choice that would be good for his mental well being.

This was a double betrayal by your sister and you should not in any way, shape, or form be forced to spend time with her.\n\nYour parents can start planning separate events.

Divorced parents do this all the time. \n\nI can understand your parents wanting to give your sister a chance - it is truly a difficult thing for many parents to abandon a child and not give them a second chance.

But as for the other question, i would have no problem if my parents want a relationship with her outside of me, thats their buisness and i understand shes their daughter. My problem is the proposal of this whole back into the family, family including me. She hasnt apologised whatsoever even though there was a good chance i would of forgave her back then if she did. \n\nI still love my sister but I dont think I could mentally cope being around someone that caused so much pain without even trying to apoligise or make up for all the hurt.

Because in most places you can't just \"put\" someone on a birth certificate, it has to be signed by the other parent.", "You are correct. My first boyfriend got a girl pregnant off a one night stand and she slept with his friend the week after. She went on welfare and named him as the father despite there not being a paternity test or a signed birth certificate. I paid (20+ years ago) $1400 for the paternity test because if he didn\u2019t pay child support he\u2019d lose his license to drive and we didn\u2019t want to pay for a child that wasn\u2019t his.

It is. Not even a wrong one but it still is.", "My sister no but not sure about the friend who was accusing me tho. I was like 22 or 23 at the time and living on my step sisters couch because of it all and didnt have the energy or resorces to fight it. Even regular court fees would of fucked me, was lucky enough to get that somewhat good advice from a friends aunt who is a lawyer but not exactly an expert on that sort of law. Lucky it never needed to go that far and it all kinda fizzled out once things came out.", "So it was his tho? \n\nI bet paternity tests have become much cheaper.", "Oh, good.

Do not give an inch, and tell your parents if they try to manipulate a reconciliation that you will consider them dead to you. That happens a *lot*.\n\nUse your words and twist that knife deep if you have to in order to keep them from even thinking about it again. They owe you more than that after what they did.

I'm sorry you went through that.", "So without a DNA test your family assumed the worst about you. What year did this story happen. Seems far fetched.", "YTA, your family asked you if you were okay with her being let back in. This is pretty basic common courtesy considering you were the injured party and therefore its ultimately up to you if she is forgiven. To turn that back around and say 'nah, I don't want to make that decision. Do whatever you want. Just keep in mind that if you let her back in I am ditching you all\" is a cowardly dick move on your part. You pretty clearly don't want her around so just say 'no, I am not comfortable with that' instead of passing the buck and threatening the people you passed it to that if they make the wrong choice you will punish them.  All you have done is made this shit needlessly complicated for no reason when it should have been a simple 'no, I am still not comfortable being around her'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously, why did you do this? What point were you trying to make? What goal did you hope to achieve?", "The situation is messed up, and this was NOT your fault. However, you are Not letting your parents decide freely, as you say.

Your sister's previous actions weren't just some cute scheme to be connected to her best friend, OP.  She attempted to hijack your life emotionally, financially and legally.  Without your two loyal family members, only a DNA test could have exonerated you, and that possibly only after you appeared on the baby's birth certificate.  Your sister is a proven liar and morally lacking.  If she has since changed, great, but she cannot change what she deliberately tried to do to you.  If your parents feel the need to reabsorb her into the family, it really sounds like a family you will not miss.

So OP refusing to make a choice, passing the buck to a non-injured party, and tacking on a 'PS: If you choose wrong I am punishing you' is a cowardly dick move on his part.
