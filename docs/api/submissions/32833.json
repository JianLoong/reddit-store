If it's truly important to wife (even though it doesn't sound like she gets anytime with her parents or sister) then I'd suggest including them every other vacation.\n\nI once put together a huge family vacation in the Outerbanks (my family of 3, sisters family of 3, other sisters family of 5, in-laws, and Mom - kids between 4 and 5 with one 10 year old).  I paid the majority, in-laws and Mom paid part.  Sister with family of 3 contributed a smaller share with my Mom making up the difference.  Sister with family of 5 paid $0.  Not only did she pay $0, but she got 2 rooms just for her family, both on the ground floor.  She \"repaid\" the favor by taking her family, and only her family out mini-golfing.  Never offered to take care of dinner one night, take us out, etc.  Then complained about the 2 rooms given to her that she paid nothing for (they were on the ground floor with the game room and there was a hot tub just outside the kids room).  Then insisted if I were to plan another trip I need to consult her first.  I never invited her family again.  That was 12 years ago.  We get together for holidays where we visit each other for a few hours, but we don't vacation together.\n\nMy other sister now is a family of 4 and they ended up buying a house near the beach we love.  We still rent a VRBO once a year and always invite them to spend the days with us if they're staying at their house (their house is a couple of miles to the beach access and the VRBO is usually beach front and convenient with kids since we can hop into the house for bathroom/food/snacks/breaks).  In-laws and Mom would come for the week as well.  I'd buy quick breakfast items if the kids woke up early (donuts, pop-tarts, cereal).  Then I'd make a big hot breakfast around 9/10am for everyone (changing it up every day), grandparents would handle lunch and often did the dishes.  Husbands would handle dinner.  Women handled kid wrangling/sunscreen/etc.  We played games as a family.  It was nice.\n\nNow it tends to be me and my husband with our teen son and his two best friends.  It's relaxing.  The boys are old enough to be helpful and this year will be able to walk up to the pier and restaurants on their own.  The in-laws went with us for a few years but MIL now has mobility & health issues that make it hard to accommodate.  So the past 2 years we've gone without them.\n\nLife evolves.  Vacation with littles isn't very relaxing though it is nice in a different way.

You're mad they don't help with food, but why help if they are eating out? You don't like it when they do their own thing. You can't use them to babysit your children, which are your responsibility.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to vacation with just your wife and children, but no one person should dictate the terms of a family vacation. I  suggest you push for one vacation without her family.

I highly recommend getting holiday apartments in the same building or places to stay within a block of each other. That way you, your wife and the kids can come and go visiting as you please but also have space from each other. Or go on a cruise together. I love my family; they are good people but they drive me nuts staying in the same house with them longer than two days. We get along great when we all have our own space close by each other. You are also then only responsible for your own space. Three young kids is a lot of energy to babysit when you are getting older. Also, seeing her family brings your wife joy.
