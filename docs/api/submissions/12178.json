My whole life me and my dad has struggled, our heads barely above water until about a three years ago.\n\nA three years ago my dad got his dream job (construction) and it pays a lot of money, I'm obviously very proud of him, he deserves this more than anyone. I'll try to make this quick to get to the actual story. My dad met a woman (38f, Z), she works at the same place as him and they hit it off. He introduced me to her 2 years ago and Z also has two children (13m, twins). \n\nTo the actual story now, since I was 5 I have been asking for a kitten. It's always been something I've wanted but never could get for various of reasons. (places we live, money, my dad fear of them) As you can imagine being a child and not have any siblings, being homeschooled with no friends, and your parent always leaving you alone, it's so lonely. I've tried multiple time to plead my case and have gotten one of the three reasons above. \n\nWell recently I have been in charge of watching Z's kids whenever she and dad has anything they want to do alone. My dad and Z have been talking about moving in together which is kids haven't had much say in but by the different treatment we've been getting, I know I'm not okay with it. Recently the boys have been asking my dad and Z for a puppy, and lately they've been putting it off. Until valentine's day when Z and my dad sat us down and told us that they'd two surprises.\n\nOne being we're all moving in together, the boys were happy and immediately started calling my dad things like pops, dad, etc. Obviously I wasn't happy so to cut the celebration short, I asked what the second surprise was and you guessed it. A puppy, I told my dad that it wasn't fair that the boys get a puppy after asking for a few days but I don't when ive been ten years, he responded telling me I was being selfish and childish. And now the house is really tense, and I'm thinking I'm an ah. \n\n(Sorry if the story is patchy, english is my third language.)\n\nedit: I didn't mention this before because I didn't think it'd be important, but I have spoken to my dad privately on multiple accounts.

Also, you're not being childish when you *are* still a child.\n\nHowever, now is the time to be realistic when it comes to your relationship with your father. I would start looking forward to a kitten as something you will provide for yourself when you're older and have that agency.", "NTA. Have you tried speaking to your dad about this alone without everyone around? It's not fair on you. The twins have each other growing up, and I think it's understandable that you're feeling upset by this. Try to discuss it with him in a calm way. Hopefully, he'll see it from your perspective. \nYou might be surprised though, just because the puppy is bought for the twins, the novelty will likely quickly wear off. Dogs are smart, the puppy will probably become more your dog if you show consistent love and care and it bonds with you.", "NTA -Your dad owes you a damned kitten!", "NTA\n\nYoure not childish or selfish! Your dads being unfair, to me it feels like he\u2019s giving in to Z\u2019s children to make them & her happy but what about you?", "NTA. \n\nOf course you're disappointed. That's a natural, normal reaction. \n\nIt's not easy blending families. Especially since you and your dad have been on your own for so long. There will be times when things don't seem fair. There will be other, better times, too. \n\nYou might try to talk with your dad and Z and say that it would be good for a kitten and a puppy to grow up together. If they still seem set against it, it won't be too many years until you will be out on your own and can get your own kitten.\n\nI know it's easier said than done but do try to make the best of this situation. Brothers can come in handy sometimes.\n\nAlso, if you hadn't said it, I would never have known English wasn't your first language.", "NTA, classic parent favors the new partner and stepchildren over his own kid, it\u2019s pathetic. Seems like all he wants to do is please his new wife at the expense of his own kid. God, I\u2019ll never understand why parents like this are so freaking desperate for affections that they do this and wonder why their kid doesn\u2019t want anything to do with them in the future.", "NTA, he is definitely treating them differently compared to you..", "I have a 15 year old daughter and i am widowed. I would never move anyone in without her permission", "NTA. It reasonable to feel upset with this sort of hypocrisy but your dad obviously likes dogs and doesn't like cats. No matter how long you ask for one you are never getting one. Just wait till you leave home then you can buy yourself a cat.", "NTA.\n\nYou're 15. I say this with all due respect but you're young, and you're experiencing some jealousy that is totally normal considering you've had your dad all to yourself for 13 years and are experiencing changes to your family dynamic that include two new siblings who from your perspective are immediately getting something they want that you've been wanting for a decade. Your feelings are valid and it's understandable that you had an emotional outburst. They probably agreed to a puppy to help distract you all from the huge changes because it can be a hard transition, but they didn't realize what it would mean/look like to you.\n\nWhile you're not an asshole by any means, I do think the best thing to do would be to apologize for making a scene at that moment instead of expressing your feelings to your dad privately. And then I would go on to explain to your dad (privately) why you feel the way you do. Hopefully your dad will genuinely listen and have an open conversation with you. I'm hoping he just called you childish because you complained in front of everyone and that if you calmly simply state how it made you feel, he won't continue to feel that you are being childish.\n\nBest of luck to you with these new changes to come! it can be a very tough adjustment period so I hope everything works out for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sorry this is happening to you", "NTA, him telling you you're childish is unfair, you're still a child ! Be careful with them parentifying you. For the dog at the end of the day it's the parents decision and they may prefer dogs to cats don't take it personally. A dog is a lot of work so be careful with them dumping their responsibilities towards the dog on you.", "Well, I'm seriously impressed and humbled that English is your third language. English is my ONLY language.\n\nNTA for feeling like your Dad let you down on the kitten thing. Maybe he actually doesn't like cats, but if that's the case he should have told you.\n\nIt's very possible that your Dad is really worried about how Z's two boys will settle into their new home and thought the puppy would help. That doesn't make you feel any better though, and he should have told you ahead of time. Maybe he didn't realize how hard you would take it, but he probably should have.\n\nHere's the thing. You wanted a kitten because you were lonely, left home alone a lot while your Dad was at work. Now you will have two brothers AND a pet (yes, a dog instead of a cat, but still...) so you won't be lonely anymore. There will be real challenges with having three people joining your two-person family, and there will also be opportunities for family fun, happiness and joy.\n\nIt would be really great for you to have ongoing, honest, kind discussions with your Dad about how you are feeling, now and in the future. He loves you and wants you to be happy. He also loves Z and wants her and her sons to be happy. Everyone wants the same things here - to be happy together, to be respectful of each other, to know that disagreements will happen and that they can be resolved with open communication and love. Things won't always be \"fair\" because life doesn't work that way. Being resilient (quickly bouncing back) in the face of \"unfair\" will go a long way toward you feeling content in your blended family for the next few years.", "I just really wanted to believe that he would do it because he always promised eventually.", "I'll try to revisit the topic both alone, and with him & Z to see if they'd understand my point.", "haha this should be this hilarious, thank!", "thank you, for your advice. It does seem as though, I'd have to wait until I am of age to get my own pet. & Thanks haha, ived been taking classes for so long, and I'm just getting it together.", "I promised myself that until my daughter was grown if something happened to my husband, I\u2019d never move someone in.  I experienced this, really liked my mom\u2019s boyfriend and 1 day he was just gone.  She gave us no heads up on moving him in or out.", "Hi! There's no real way you'd know this but I have spoken to my dad privately repeatedly, and I am going to try again with him first then him and Z .", "haha thank you, also you seem very wise. thank you, I will take in everthing you said.", "I get that, but if your father has a fear of cats and just bought the household a dog, it just might not be a doable action as far as your current household operates.\n\nAnd yes that's terrible and unfair, but it also doesn't mean you'll go your entire life without owning a cat.", "ah I'm sorry. Like I said, your feelings are totally normal. I hope this is just your dad trying to smooth over the transition period and not ongoing preferential treatment to the twins. It can be common for a step parent to almost overdo it to impress the kids that are new to the family and accidentally neglecting their own kids. he already has a relationship with you and has to try and make up for 13 years with them. Not that it's right, just that it's easy for parents to make that mistake. Hopefully he will listen and understand how you're feeling about things.", "Thank you. I really needed outside points of views, it is a really eye opener.", "I think it isn't about a kitten, isn't it? Even if you had asked for a puppy you would not say \"hurray, i get one!\"\n\n\nIt's about having wishes and how/when they are made real by your parent .\n\n\nAnd you should address THIS with your father. Tell him it's not about a cat or a dog or even a hamster. It's about you begging for years and the twins asking a Week. \n\nI really wish it will work out for you. Or at least enough to accept it. You will be an adult soon enough moving out and getting 2! Kitten only for yourself \ud83d\ude1c"]}
