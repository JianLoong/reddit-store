AFAIK she has some chronic illnesses but is ok.\n\nThe day before we left, my step dad took me aside and scolded me for not volunteering to give up my portion of the inheritance.  My step dad and mom don't have any children of their own.  They got married when all 3 of us were out of the house.  He said it was unkind of me not to take the hint.  He said she would probably just go ahead and make the decision anyway but that it would be difficult for her without my blessing.  I refused.\n\nThe inheritance itself would be something like $200k.

We all have the same father, but they had me just out of high school.   My mom didn't have much time for me because she worked full-time and went to school.  By  the time she was doing well financially, I was in college.  She didn't help me financially; I got scholarships and took loans.\n\nMy husband and I are upper middle class.  We are both highly paid professionals with advanced degrees, but we have kids approaching college age and could use some cash to help pay for their education.\n\nMy brother is doing fine.  He had a kid out of wedlock when he was younger, but sorted his life out.  He has a stable job but money can be a bit tight because he's now married with two kids in addition to the earlier kid.\n\nMy sister is a high functioning disaster.  She and her husband have 3 kids between them and neither of them has a stable job.  She's gone through multiple degree programs, dropping out each time.  She flits between side hustles (MLM stuff, mostly).  My mom has supported her all her life.  She's also taken a lot of money from other family members.

You may be well off, but a couple-few hundred thousand dollars might be the reason your kids could attend their first-choice universities without starting their adult lives on servitude to an increasingly predatory student loan system. In the hands of your sister, there is no reason to believe that her share of your share wouldn\u2019t just turn into a BMW convertible, a 70\u201d plasma tv and a couple weeks at a posh resort in Antigua or some such. Her main problem isn\u2019t with a lack of funds, it\u2019s a lack of discipline.

You feel that you\u2019ve been on the short end of her parental favoritism your whole life (does she know you feel that way?), and now she\u2019s considering doing it again on a grand scale. If her dying legacy to you is to punish your kids for your success in order to continue her pattern of favoritism toward her younger children, I imagine you\u2019d feel rather abandoned.

Take some time to examine your feelings around this, so you can explain them calmly when you talk to her, and hopefully you can have a conversation about the whole situation and find out exactly what\u2019s going on.", "But he's sorted his life out now!", "Info: Any upsides to your relationship with your mother?", "NTA - all you needed was the first 2 paragraphs, everything else is superfluous and unnecessary. Doesn't matter what the situations are or have been, it's cruel to write one of your children out of your will, simple as.", "I had a stroke. My mom was handling some financial issues and had authorization to make decisions for me.  They thought I was going to die. I didn't. They didn't even get a good price.  My nieces were heirs to the house with me because of their Dad.  I wasn't living there. It's just way 3127 that my family used my self sufficiency to screw me over.", "Nta. You should inherit the same as the rest. It's not about who needs it more.", "NTA. Make it awkward. Writing you out of the will to give your share to your \u201chigh functioning disaster\u201d of a sister only encourages her to never have any responsibility. Why would she change with a windfall of money when someone is always there to bail her out? She\u2019ll likely waste the entire inheritance, after gloating that she got everything, and then come to OP asking for aid again.", "NTA. If your mum wants to make such a big statement, then she has to be willing to actually front it up and have a discussion with you about it, regardless of how awkward it would be. She can\u2019t rely on you picking up on hints. \n\nShe knows it\u2019s a horrible thing to do, which is why she\u2019s looking for you to volunteer rather than talk to you about it. \n\nIt\u2019s just really shitty to be honest. It\u2019s like you\u2019re being penalised for having your life together.", "NTA. I tell my kids (actual kids not adults) \u201cdon\u2019t complain, ask for what you want\u201d. \n\nHinting between adults is 100% bullshit. Using an intermediary to ask instead of doing it directly is 100% bullshit. \n\nIf she wants your \u201cblessing\u201d she should ask for it", "NTA, I have a mother much the same. It\u2019s extremely demoralising to know you just don\u2019t rate the same kind of care or attention as your siblings, especially when you\u2019re the \u201cgood\u201d one. I\u2019m just very tired of it, and sick of subjugating my needs to make it easier for my mother to fulfil my siblings selfish wants, and I refuse to do it anymore. And that\u2019s exactly what you mother is expecting you to do, and your stepfather is straight up berating you for. It\u2019s not fair and you don\u2019t have to do it; and should not be made to feel guilty for feeling that way. These are choices THEY have been and will continue to make, they should be the ones to deal with the consequences, not you.", "NTA! You might want to pay the bill she says is late directly because I just gave money with my sister for her house to not be taken but her and her husband used it for something else instead \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f! They were ended up homeless and I was never paid back!", "NTA, ask your mom about this matter and ask her if its true that she wants to cut you out of her will. If so, decide what to do once you have that information. Personally from reading the situation I\u2019d probably cut her off if she would write you out of the will. Mainly because it shows she truly cares more about your brother and sister and if she we\u2019re to pass on your brother and sister would probably be at your doorstep asking for money when they need it and basically use you for your money like your sister already is doing.", "NTA, if any of her kids should be written out its your sister.", "Imo she should dis-inherit and drop support for the train wreck.  No one is doing them favors by most likely funding their bad habits.", "NTA\n\nMy sister has been doing this with her two children.  Her son has always worked hard and has a successful career (as does his wife).  Her daughter has had a mixed past and has a reasonable career but \"is not good with money\".  When my mother died, my sister gave all of her share of her inheritance to her daughter and none to her son, on the basis that \"he doesn't need it\" and her daughter wanted to buy a house.  My sister seems oblivious to the annoyance that this causes her son and his wife.  Despite this, she apparently hopes to live with her son and his wife in old age, because they have more money and are more organised than her daughter.  I think my sister is deluded.", "NTA. There's no way of knowing what will happen at the time your mom passes. What if you and your husband are involved in an accident and have to survive in disability? Or something happens to your sister and you end up taking care of her kids?\n\nIs a 3 way even split even fair given that your mom has been supporting your sister? Hasn't your sister been using up her share of the inheritance?\n\nEta all this assumes that your mom's end of life care won't eventually eat up what would have been an inheritance.", "So OP got the short end of the stick in her childhood, because her parents had less money and less time when she needed support. Whereas they were able to help her siblings more.\n\nNow she still helps her sister out financially from time to time. And her mother expects her to help her siblings after the mother passes.\n\nBut her mother and step-dad also expect her to give up her inheritance. She should have the work and responsibility, but not the economic help.\n\nThis is BS. Not the asshole at all.", "But writing someone out of your will is bad. I did it with family who i don't know, who feels like strengers. I'm not getting kids.. and even i feel bad about it. And i have nothing with those people", "Yeah, the reward is not getting the inheritance but getting all the work", "Well in my country you can actually sue and get your share of inheritance, if your parents tried to exclude you. In my opinion it's great because till relatively recently people still put only sons in their will.", "Wait, where did it say the mother expected OP to help her siblings, I only read they just wanted OP to give up her inheritance. Like, I'm really missing that.", "Further point the  OP bringing it up and getting upset would fuel the parents to treat her as acting out and being \"ungrateful\" giving them justification in their eyes to remover her anyway.", "Bring this up if ever your mom/stepdad brings up the topic again. So selfish of them not to see you as one of their children tbh. It\u2019s not like any of you guys would be hurting if the will was still split threeways.", "It's literally the second sentence.", "You need to let her know that if this is what she wants she needs to be prepared in knowing a lot of relationships will change. Hers with yours and yours with the siblings because you're not going to help them out anymore. You're going to also cancel your credit card the sister has and doesn't pay on (you gave her free money)", "Why is it falling on you to again be the \"good\" child and get the short end of the stick. Why is it going to be on you to help someone who has never learned consequences and been enabled by everyone else in her life, including by you? Such an action by your mother should have dire consequences for her and your siblings as she will be smacking you in the face with how much care, concern, and support she actually gives you, aka none.", "I think you should not look forward to the inheritance, cause it looks like she doesn't want you to get anything", "This is a really intelligent point!"]}
