She talked about how glad she was that I  would be able to take care of my family after she was gone.  She  was more worried about both of my siblings and their families.  AFAIK she has some chronic illnesses but is ok.\n\nThe day before we left, my step dad took me aside and scolded me for not volunteering to give up my portion of the inheritance.  My step dad and mom don't have any children of their own.  They got married when all 3 of us were out of the house.  He said it was unkind of me not to take the hint.  He said she would probably just go ahead and make the decision anyway but that it would be difficult for her without my blessing.  I refused.\n\nThe inheritance itself would be something like $200k.  I know she has a 500k life insurance policy.  She also has a nest egg from the sale of her house from which she moved in to my step dad.  The will is currently split evenly 3 ways.\n\nI'm the oldest.  My brother is the middle child, while my sister is the youngest.  I'm in my late 40s and a good bit older than them.  We all have the same father, but they had me just out of high school.   My mom didn't have much time for me because she worked full-time and went to school.  By  the time she was doing well financially, I was in college.  She didn't help me financially; I got scholarships and took loans.\n\nMy husband and I are upper middle class.  We are both highly paid professionals with advanced degrees, but we have kids approaching college age and could use some cash to help pay for their education.\n\nMy brother is doing fine.  He had a kid out of wedlock when he was younger, but sorted his life out.  He has a stable job but money can be a bit tight because he's now married with two kids in addition to the earlier kid.\n\nMy sister is a high functioning disaster.  She and her husband have 3 kids between them and neither of them has a stable job.  She's gone through multiple degree programs, dropping out each time.  She flits between side hustles (MLM stuff, mostly).  My mom has supported her all her life.  She's also taken a lot of money from other family members.  I end up paying a bill for her 2-3 times per year when she calls me out of nowhere to tell me the lights are going to turn off if I don't send her $100.  She lives well above her means.  Recently, I lent her my credit card to get the groceries for a family holiday when we were all staying at VRBO....and she \"accidentally\" put some of her Christmas gifts on my card.  She apologized when I said something, and said she'd repay me...but of course she hasn't.\n\nI've always been the \"good\" kid but I feel mom has never had as much time or support for me.  I realize that circumstances were different.  But, it's tough for me not to see this as just one more time when I'm not a priority.  If she wants to disinherit me, that's her choice.  I just don't feel like I should have to make it emotionally easier for her.", "created_utc": 1672524002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1004rxn/aita_for_not_volunteering_to_be_disinherited/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It completely sucks when your parents decide that you are also \"parent\" and not child. And that it's your duty, because you made better choices than your siblings, to care for them (translation: continue enabling them). What a reward for good behavior, right?\n\nIt's all bullshit. And it says something that this isn't coming from your mom, but from your step-dad.\n\nDefinitely don't make it easy on her. \n\nNTA.", "Tell your mother that if she disinherits you, you won't he able to make sure your sister is ok.

After growing up with a physically and emotionally unavailable mother, and now having a little brother who will be raised differently than I, I recognize how that parenting is the most valuable thing. Considering you didn't get as much access to your mom as a child needs, an inheritance can offer some consolation.", "NTA. Sadly, you will likely get little to nothing. Brother a bit more.

Your mother and step father are for suggesting this.\n\nAdditionally they will be doing your sister (and i assume this is mostly because of her) no favours.\n\nI would also guess they are continually supporting her now, and this is also not doing her any favours.

You'll be resentful, and in a few years when she's spent her share and comes asking you for more, you would be less likely to help. Better to give you your fair share, as you can best steward the money.", "NTA.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to have a frank conversation with your mother about the practical and emotional significances of disinheritance for you. You may be well off, but a couple-few hundred thousand dollars might be the reason your kids could attend their first-choice universities without starting their adult lives on servitude to an increasingly predatory student loan system. In the hands of your sister, there is no reason to believe that her share of your share wouldn\u2019t just turn into a BMW convertible, a 70\u201d plasma tv and a couple weeks at a posh resort in Antigua or some such. Her main problem isn\u2019t with a lack of funds, it\u2019s a lack of discipline. Half of your disinheritance won\u2019t stop her from squandering what she has on frivolous purchases, it will just broaden the scope of her frivolity, and she\u2019ll still need somebody to front her the light bill from time to time.\n\nMore important than practical finances, however, is the emotional blowback. You feel that you\u2019ve been on the short end of her parental favoritism your whole life (does she know you feel that way?), and now she\u2019s considering doing it again on a grand scale. If her dying legacy to you is to punish your kids for your success in order to continue her pattern of favoritism toward her younger children, I imagine you\u2019d feel rather abandoned. It\u2019s an uncomfortable topic to broach, but I think it\u2019s important to let her know how she\u2019s affecting your mental state.", "I genuinely don't know why you would volunteer to be disinherited? If she wants to do it then she needs to deal with the emotions that brings, you shouldn't have to make it easy on her.", "NTA- hang tight girlfriend. Your family is watching and learning. Your children are learning what happens and they have seen your Mom care and baby your sister. You did just fine. Let it play out however it does but don\u2019t make it easy for your Mom. She\u2019s wanting an easy way out- nope. Big hugs to you. My Dad was \u201c the good kid\u201d is his family and I\u2019ve seen how this plays out.", "NTA\n\nWay for them to emotionally manipulate you to alleviate their guilt. Your mom is going to do whatever she wants with her money, as is her right. But she's a coward playing games so you'll volunteer to give the money just so she won't have to deal with those icky feelings. That's her problem.", "NTA", "NTA it's not your job to look out for your siblings hypothetically or in real life (though the fact that you do makes you a very generous person imo). The will and money is your mom's business and you're entitled to not want to give up your part of it. You shouldn't be penalized for having your life together.", "NTA - show this feed to your mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
