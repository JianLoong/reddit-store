She talked about how glad she was that I  would be able to take care of my family after she was gone.  She  was more worried about both of my siblings and their families.  AFAIK she has some chronic illnesses but is ok.\n\nThe day before we left, my step dad took me aside and scolded me for not volunteering to give up my portion of the inheritance.  My step dad and mom don't have any children of their own.  They got married when all 3 of us were out of the house.  He said it was unkind of me not to take the hint.  He said she would probably just go ahead and make the decision anyway but that it would be difficult for her without my blessing.  I refused.\n\nThe inheritance itself would be something like $200k.  I know she has a 500k life insurance policy.  She also has a nest egg from the sale of her house from which she moved in to my step dad.  The will is currently split evenly 3 ways.\n\nI'm the oldest.  My brother is the middle child, while my sister is the youngest.  I'm in my late 40s and a good bit older than them.  We all have the same father, but they had me just out of high school.   My mom didn't have much time for me because she worked full-time and went to school.  By  the time she was doing well financially, I was in college.  She didn't help me financially; I got scholarships and took loans.\n\nMy husband and I are upper middle class.  We are both highly paid professionals with advanced degrees, but we have kids approaching college age and could use some cash to help pay for their education.\n\nMy brother is doing fine.  He had a kid out of wedlock when he was younger, but sorted his life out.  He has a stable job but money can be a bit tight because he's now married with two kids in addition to the earlier kid.\n\nMy sister is a high functioning disaster.  She and her husband have 3 kids between them and neither of them has a stable job.  She's gone through multiple degree programs, dropping out each time.  She flits between side hustles (MLM stuff, mostly).  My mom has supported her all her life.  She's also taken a lot of money from other family members.  I end up paying a bill for her 2-3 times per year when she calls me out of nowhere to tell me the lights are going to turn off if I don't send her $100.  She lives well above her means.  Recently, I lent her my credit card to get the groceries for a family holiday when we were all staying at VRBO....and she \"accidentally\" put some of her Christmas gifts on my card.  She apologized when I said something, and said she'd repay me...but of course she hasn't.\n\nI've always been the \"good\" kid but I feel mom has never had as much time or support for me.  I realize that circumstances were different.  But, it's tough for me not to see this as just one more time when I'm not a priority.  If she wants to disinherit me, that's her choice.

You may be well off, but a couple-few hundred thousand dollars might be the reason your kids could attend their first-choice universities without starting their adult lives on servitude to an increasingly predatory student loan system. In the hands of your sister, there is no reason to believe that her share of your share wouldn\u2019t just turn into a BMW convertible, a 70\u201d plasma tv and a couple weeks at a posh resort in Antigua or some such. Her main problem isn\u2019t with a lack of funds, it\u2019s a lack of discipline.

You feel that you\u2019ve been on the short end of her parental favoritism your whole life (does she know you feel that way?), and now she\u2019s considering doing it again on a grand scale. If her dying legacy to you is to punish your kids for your success in order to continue her pattern of favoritism toward her younger children, I imagine you\u2019d feel rather abandoned.

You know, if you want to write me out of your will and give my share to (sibling) that would be just fine with me!\"", "NTA. The key phrase here is \u201cdon\u2019t set yourself on fire just to keep other\u2019s warm\u201d.  You are helping to support your sister AND could use inheritance money to pay for your kid\u2019s college. So don\u2019t voluntarily disinherit yourself. \n\nYou should also \u201cmention\u201d to your parents that you have been sending money to your sister, but if mom is going to cut your inheritance you will stop doing that and start depositing that $$ into a college fund for your kids. Your kids will need it more if your mom isn\u2019t going to help with their college costs. Hopefully she will take the hints.", "NTA. If she tries to hint at it again you should make sure to point out that you are older than your siblings and therefore of course you\u2019re in a more comfortable part of life but that doesn\u2019t mean that when she passes they won\u2019t be there too! Tell her to just wait a few years and see how different things will be fore them. Even if nothing will change it might remind her that you are as deserving. I find this kind of stuff happens when there is a large age gap with siblings. Parents think the younger ones are failing because they haven\u2019t reached the same life milestones as the older ones at the same time. In your moms case she thinks they need more support when really they need less so they can succeed on their own.", "NTA - doing an estate is hard enough when it\u2019s split evenly. When some siblings get preferential treatment, it leads to poor sibling relationships.", "Honey, a will is an ambulatory document, and it can be changed at any time so long as at that time, the testator has testamentary capacity. Why would somebody be after you to disclaim an inheritance, which does not yet exist, and when the testator can change his or her mind at any time? This is insane.", "You can choose to share your inheritance after you receive it if you choose.", " NTA.\n\nIf she decides to give you anything then it will be your decision to do what you want with the inheritance. Up to that point don\u2019t go into it.", "NTA but your SD is the AH honestly it's nothing to do with him, what your mum does with her money and how she wants divide it up. He shouldn't have approached you and asked you to consider giving up your inheritance. Wtf l would have told him where to go. STOP being the good daughter and remind him you are one of three children not two and it doesn't matter about life choices it's the fact it should if your mum want and personally should divide three ways. It's not on you because of your siblings lifestyle choices. Maybe in the future stop enabling your sisters behaviour and tell her to live within her means.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say YTA. Your mom is worried about the fate of her children when she's no longer around. She probably loves you tremendously, and her death anxiety is alleviated by the life you've created for yourself. You don't feel you are obligated to make the choice easier for her when right now she's clearly fearful for her life and doesn't know what to do. I've learned a long time ago that your parents are not obligated to love you. She wasn't obligated to struggle for you to have a life. She could've just given you away.\n\nMaybe a lot of people will disagree with me, but I empathize greatly with death anxiety. Right now, she doesn't need you to make her feel guilty. Something she could use, though, is guidance, understanding, and reassurance that everything will be okay. Your feelings are understandable, but they do come from a sense of entitlement. The day she does pass, you might realize that letting her live the rest of her days in guilt was not worth an inheritance.", "In 'The Milllionaire Next Door', Stanley Danko calls this 'strengthening the strong, and weakening the weak'. There's a pattern where parents bail out the kids that repeatedly fail, and leave the 'okay' ones to fend for themselves. The kids that get repeatedly rescued never learn to stand on their own two feet, and the 'okay' kids feel unloved.", "NTA - that sucks. I\u2019m the oldest too \u2026 siblings haven\u2019t done so great despite having the same opportunities. My dad left my mom well provided for, and was meticulous about his will \u2026 though I don\u2019t know it (it was a book).\n\nI kinda expect equal shares when mom passes, but who knows. If anyone asked me to give up what my dad wanted me to have, it would be a quick, hard NO.", "What? This makes no sense. How is OP being an asshole? This is clearly favoritism.\n\n> I've learned a long time ago that your parents are not obligated to love you. She wasn't obligated to struggle for you to have a life. She could've just given you away.\n\nThis is beyond stupid, children aren\u2019t asked to be born\u2014parents are the ones that choose to have children in the first place.", "I think your stepdad looking after himself and his future....", "Must she? How sure are you that your mother knows anything about all of this?", "I don't see any reason why you should make it easier for your mom to do something unfair.  Also I would point out to your mom that really you should get more of the money since you are going to be taking care of your younger sister.  She will blow the inheritance immediately and then be back to taking money from op.", "If your mom broaches this subject again with you -- that she's concerned about how her other children will do when she's gone -- offer to hook her up with an attorney who can help her structure her assets into a trust for each of you: an arrangement where funds are only paid out for specific legitimate reasons, and payment is made directly to the receiving party (for example, to the utility company, or the university, or the health care provider/facility, or the bank holding the mortgage, etc). Tell her that doing this would ensure that her children and grandchildren have their necessities provided for in the long-term, and that the money wouldn't get blown away in the short-term on unnecessary purchases or gambling, leaving them destitute.\n\nSuch an arrangement would have the added benefit of leaving you off the hook for constantly having to bail out your sister from her poor financial choices once your mom is gone.", "Or the youngest sibling's money should be left in a trust, so that she can't blow it."]}
