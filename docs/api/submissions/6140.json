She talked about how glad she was that I  would be able to take care of my family after she was gone.  She  was more worried about both of my siblings and their families.  AFAIK she has some chronic illnesses but is ok.\n\nThe day before we left, my step dad took me aside and scolded me for not volunteering to give up my portion of the inheritance.  My step dad and mom don't have any children of their own.  They got married when all 3 of us were out of the house.  He said it was unkind of me not to take the hint.  He said she would probably just go ahead and make the decision anyway but that it would be difficult for her without my blessing.  I refused.\n\nThe inheritance itself would be something like $200k.  I know she has a 500k life insurance policy.  She also has a nest egg from the sale of her house from which she moved in to my step dad.  The will is currently split evenly 3 ways.\n\nI'm the oldest.  My brother is the middle child, while my sister is the youngest.  I'm in my late 40s and a good bit older than them.  We all have the same father, but they had me just out of high school.   My mom didn't have much time for me because she worked full-time and went to school.  By  the time she was doing well financially, I was in college.  She didn't help me financially; I got scholarships and took loans.\n\nMy husband and I are upper middle class.  We are both highly paid professionals with advanced degrees, but we have kids approaching college age and could use some cash to help pay for their education.\n\nMy brother is doing fine.  He had a kid out of wedlock when he was younger, but sorted his life out.  He has a stable job but money can be a bit tight because he's now married with two kids in addition to the earlier kid.\n\nMy sister is a high functioning disaster.  She and her husband have 3 kids between them and neither of them has a stable job.  She's gone through multiple degree programs, dropping out each time.  She flits between side hustles (MLM stuff, mostly).  My mom has supported her all her life.  She's also taken a lot of money from other family members.  I end up paying a bill for her 2-3 times per year when she calls me out of nowhere to tell me the lights are going to turn off if I don't send her $100.  She lives well above her means.  Recently, I lent her my credit card to get the groceries for a family holiday when we were all staying at VRBO....and she \"accidentally\" put some of her Christmas gifts on my card.  She apologized when I said something, and said she'd repay me...but of course she hasn't.\n\nI've always been the \"good\" kid but I feel mom has never had as much time or support for me.  I realize that circumstances were different.  But, it's tough for me not to see this as just one more time when I'm not a priority.  If she wants to disinherit me, that's her choice.

You may be well off, but a couple-few hundred thousand dollars might be the reason your kids could attend their first-choice universities without starting their adult lives on servitude to an increasingly predatory student loan system. In the hands of your sister, there is no reason to believe that her share of your share wouldn\u2019t just turn into a BMW convertible, a 70\u201d plasma tv and a couple weeks at a posh resort in Antigua or some such. Her main problem isn\u2019t with a lack of funds, it\u2019s a lack of discipline.

You feel that you\u2019ve been on the short end of her parental favoritism your whole life (does she know you feel that way?), and now she\u2019s considering doing it again on a grand scale. If her dying legacy to you is to punish your kids for your success in order to continue her pattern of favoritism toward her younger children, I imagine you\u2019d feel rather abandoned.

Tell her to just wait a few years and see how different things will be fore them. Even if nothing will change it might remind her that you are as deserving. I find this kind of stuff happens when there is a large age gap with siblings.

Tell her that doing this would ensure that her children and grandchildren have their necessities provided for in the long-term, and that the money wouldn't get blown away in the short-term on unnecessary purchases or gambling, leaving them destitute.\n\nSuch an arrangement would have the added benefit of leaving you off the hook for constantly having to bail out your sister from her poor financial choices once your mom is gone.", "Or the youngest sibling's money should be left in a trust, so that she can't blow it.", "NTA but I would 100% talk to you mom and let her know what her husband is saying to you.
