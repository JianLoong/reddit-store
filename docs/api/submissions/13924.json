My husband replied saying that since we pay the bills then we should get the master bedroom. I told him it was off limits and that the room belongs to dad til he passes away. He got upset and startec bringing it up and last night we had a huge argument when I found out that he started moving our stuff out the room to move it into dad's room. I yelled at him and he yelled back saying that I was treating him as if he's not a member of this family, that he's not my partner and gets a say in where we live and what room we stay.

Dont let him disrespect you or your dad", "NTA. \n\nI am going to assume when he says that he \"pays all the bills\" he means current bills and not that he went ahead and gave your father a fair market value price for the entire house.

Your Dad was not only in the room first, but you and your Dad outvote him on which room he gets. \n\nMost importantly, you need to fully appreciate and call out the complete lack of empathy and caring your husband has for your father. Your father lost his wife, is not well himself, and your husband has measured the drapes and gone so far as to start moving himself where he wants. No consideration for the real mental health impacts of moving this man (confusion), the grief (being moved out of the room he shared with his wife) and his ego (someone can come in to his home and assert where he can live). It is really gross behavior. \n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this as you also deal with your mother's passing and moving in to care for your father. But he is gross and needs to be dealt with. Be very clear with him- he may help with the bills, but he didn't buy this home with his own money, and while he contributes and is a \"resident\" he doesn't get to dictate what room he gets. More importantly, his lack of empathy for your aging and grieving father is disgusting, and he should stay in the guest room until he can apologize and agree to never act this way again, or he can go ahead and move out of the home YOU OWN.", "It's essentially your house.

Take this as a red flag.", "NTA from the info provided BUT question:\n\nWhen you inherited the house, did your husband understand that your Dad was going to be living with you?

How was that decisions made?

Now have to move to in-laws house because FIL needs care, and to boot.. the room is small/cramped/etc. But I\u2019m expected to pay for half of everything. It sounds like a lot to take in & give up. It\u2019s easier for OP because it\u2019s her parents home, it\u2019s her parent.", "Alternate take, only been married a year, meaning that he probably knew about his FIL\u2019s health issues and need for care before they got married. If he was uncomfortable with that, he should have spoken up before getting married or moving in. My husband and I had conversations about what we would do if one of our parents needed long term care before we got married, and all our parents are in good health. \n\nAnd while he might be helping to pay for expenses, he is also benefiting from his wife inheriting a house. Meaning no down payment, likely no mortgage. In today\u2019s housing market that is a huge benefit."]}
