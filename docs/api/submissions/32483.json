In situations of hyper stress and emotional overwhelm, you sometimes let that out in whoever is closest to you. That\u2019s not fair, but it\u2019s human. It also doesn\u2019t always resonate if the other person displays toxic positivity. Sometimes we are in an awful space. Then we don\u2019t need to hear \u201coh it\u2019ll all work out\u201d. Sometimes we do not feel that it\u2019ll all be ok. Sometimes it is not helpful to hear, even if meant well. I\u2019m saying this because I have been in this space - even if my coping mechanism was to retreat and withdraw rather than yell. No words of encouragement helped. I just wanted to hole up and cry and often did. I wasn\u2019t easy to be around. But I also apologized often and expressed that I appreciated everything but just couldn\u2019t deal.\n\nHowever. We have to find a way to check ourselves at some point. Being overwhelmed doesn\u2019t give her the right to be mean to you or (borderline) abusive toward you. She obviously missed that point and that\u2019s a huge issue. I don\u2019t know what would have helped, and she should\u2019ve found a way to voice what she needed or found another way to cope with the situation. It seems you handled it as well as you could. She absolutely has to reflect on what happened - better yet, you should together so this doesn\u2019t happen again. That would be my advice - but it needs both of you. If she sees nothing wrong in her behavior, even retroactively, then you gave a fair-weather marriage that will not sustain the next crisis.", "When I said that I would tell her I understood, I would validate her feelings as she is indeed feeling them.
