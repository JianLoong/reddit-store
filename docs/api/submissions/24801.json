Preparing for a planned pregnancy includes stopping drugs, including legal drugs like nicotine and alcohol, reducing caffeine, losing weight if obese, etc. Also, while I have sympathy for someone who has limited resources and can't do so, someone who has had multiple miscarriages and doesn't want more should seek medical advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerfectly healthy people can miscarry, but people have a lot of agency on risk factors for their health in general and for pregnancy in specific.", "*sigh*\n\n*unwelds places coconut in*\n\n*welds again*\n\n<-<", "Idk if she was molested or anything but I do know she kept getting in trouble for the smallest things so her parents would take her bedroom door away for months.
