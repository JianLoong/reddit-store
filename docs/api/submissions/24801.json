All of them had some sort of mental health disorder. That girl clearly has some issues going on.", "Truth", "It doesn\u2019t matter what time it is, a miscarriage is always a traumatic event. Having common decency isn\u2019t coddling.", "Therefore it's okay to be mean to someone that you know has just miscarried, bc you're not friends?  If she didn't know, that's one thing, but she literally knew.", "Sorry new to this", "Cos she is a teenager . She is young and still learning . No one has it all figured out all the time", "everyone sucks here", "Yeah, and if that's the case then a friendly word or two (which would have cost OP literally nothing) would be much more likely to work.", "Thats not how you prevent a miscarriage, that how you prevent getting pregnant", "She need empathy and a reality check. Both can happen.", "Yeah and replying in the incredibly rude and insensitive manner that OP did just makes two assholes, they are not justified in how they responded no matter what you think of \"trauma dumping\".", "I quote:\n\n>  \n>  \n>it's absolutely her fault", "I went to high school with a girl who claimed to be pregnant and then miscarry every other week for all of high.  She went so far as to print out pictures of a sonogram from a book and carry it around. She also had a real problem with being insanely promiscuous to the point of me finding her in my furnace room naked at a sleepover trying to lure my brother and his 5 friends into the room to have sex with all of them at once. She also tried to seduce my boyfriend while I was literally standing downstairs. I always suspected her dad was molesting her. He was a real creep.", "She's causing her own trauma. One can be sympathetic to someone experiencing a tragedy but at what point do they need to learn from the consequences of their actions. \n\nIf this were drug overdoses instead of miscarriages every one would be telling her to get her shit together. Both are VERY traumatic.", "If somebody keeps hitting themselves over the head, how many times will you have any empathy for them when they keep suffering concussions?", "No no it's okay to be mean to someone you don't know and don't want to know who won't stop dumping their crap on you", "No one has it figured out all the time? This is her third time you'd think she would have figured out to use protection by now. Even if she still young and learning at 19 you should know not to trauma dump on random ass strangers", "Thank you", "It would also cost op nothing to do exactly what they did. It would also cost the girl nothing to not trauma dump on some random stranger.", "Which fucking prevents a miscarriage. Congratulations you just learned cause and effect.", "Then go get it from people who actually know and care about her. Not strangers who she dumps on repeatedly", "I never said anything about what OP said. I merely responded to your comment. Also not sure why you put it in quotations. It's an actual thing, and it's a problem. Maybe look it up?", "Did we go to the same school.", "A miscarriage is not her fault. A pregnancy is, she 100% needs to learn from the 3rd time getting pregnant by just sleeping around but she can not control if the baby survives (unless shes doing drugs or something directly harmful)", "Causing one\u2019s own trauma doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be treated as trauma. Being super harsh while someone is in a vulnerable state isn\u2019t a good idea and certainly makes someone an asshole.", "Yes they are, and you should show compassion for both. You should like a pleasure to be around.", "Why are you comparing a miscarriage to someone hitting themselves in the head?", "And the time to do it is right after they've suffered an injury or loss?  I disagree -- but if you truly think so, karma.", "She may be actively trying to get pregnant . We don\u2019t know . I try not to judge others sex lives when I don\u2019t know them. There\u2019s no way people should *know not to trauma dump. People of all ages do it so it\u2019s not at all surprising that someone who is barely an adult and living an independent life for the first time  should do it . It\u2019s not an age thing it\u2019s a social skills thing anyway and something you might learn with age or not  . I worked in a university . First years and seconds did the dumbest stuff all the time . New crop did the same dumb stuff as old crop . Drank too much , left assignments till last minute and got pregnant or STDs . None of this is unusual behaviour in my experience. And all these kids pulled together to graduate . I can only think of one guy who dropped out after he failed a semester and decided to just go work instead and one girl who left after she was diagnosed with cancer . Ultimately they all faced the consequences of their own actions anyway .", "Im assuming the cause is pregnancy and the effect is miscarriage, at least thats what you mean right? So that would insinuate that everyone who got pregnant, would also miscarriage. Cause and effect asserts or denies that one thing causes another, if children were never born then yes, pregnancy will always end in miscarriage. Sadly children are born more often than they are miscarried, meaning that statistically, the cause being pregnancy and the effect being a child is more likely.", "\u201cGo get it from blah blah blah\u201d.

This chick is just having irresponsible sex and the baby doesn't survive. Tbh these unborn children are probably the lucky ones bc i feel sorry for any child she brings into this world if she doesn't get her shit together.", "None of my friends got off drugs from coddling. The ones that had tough love got clean while those who were enabled died.\n\nI'm not heartless. I took many of them to treatment centers when they actually wanted to get clean.
