Your MIL is clearly manipulative and has no right to interfere in your marriage or your sex life. \n\nShe needs to stop guilt-tripping your husband and accept that he is an adult who can make his own decisions. \n\nIn addition you went too far by shouting at her and insulting her personal choices. You could have been more civil and assertive without being rude and hurtful.\n\n You stooped to her level and escalated the conflict.", "Mellow drama? More like melodrama!\n\nYTA \u2026 potentially.

And before I get any \u201ctypical Redditor\u201d comments, since I appear to hold the unpopular opinion, I have been in a healthy marriage with boundaries for our weird ass families for over a decade.

Best to apologise and move on.", "NTA - her choice to quite literally suckle your husband while he was growing up. \nProbably didn\u2019t need to drop the sex line but I get your frustration. \nI feel like most people saying YTA haven\u2019t had to deal with a neurotic In law. \nMe Ex\u2019s mum used to belittle and be overly mean to me at every chance she had, but I wasn\u2019t fussed because I used to spit in the cups of tea I made her :) apples and oranges.", "ESH\n\nThe only thing that doesn't suck is 'mellow drama' which I love.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t think what you said is bad tbh", "ESH - why has your husband not gone to counseling? why are you staying with someone who allows others to act that way towards you?", "I\u00b4d say NTA, maybe not the right way of phrasing it, but you MIL kinda had it coming lol.", "NTA-\nI suggest the raised by narcissist reddit for your husband.

You don't deserve her freak outs and episode's. she is looking for a response or some type of reaction, ignoring her and looking \"through\" her as if she wasn't there will kill her when she is trying to get at you.

But it does depend a lot on your relationship with your MIL outside of this which is not completely explained. Info - is she one of those people who just can't stand being alone? Because I can understand that stance but it still doesn't make it okay. And she may be using her son as one of her few social interactions which you've made her feel isolated from.

It's easy to judge some one on their reaction to one situation when it seems that this is a repeated situation for OP. They shouldn't be made to feel like crap or deemed the AH over being fed up with MIL . If the MIL didn't want to have stuff said in response to her comments she shouldn't of said anything.

I don't care if she was a single mother or not, but guilt tripping your child just because of what you had to go through is an AH move. You defended your husband. You stood by his side.

Many people who are single parents end up with a long string of BFs/GFs in their lives, and to the kids it feels like a revolving door of men/women. The parent starts dating someone. The kid starts to get attached to them. Then poof, they're gone from their life. Then Mom starts dating someone new. The kid starts to get attached. Then poof, they're gone. It causes attachment disorders and abandonment issues. I think *that* is what your MIL was referring to when she said it was better for your husband for her to stay single. I don't think her staying single had anything to do with sex and you were an asshole for making it about sex. Your response shows real immaturity and a lack of compassion. You need to learn to just ignore her when she starts in.\n\nAnd your husband needs to grow a backbone and learn to stand up to her more. Sure, he may do it sometimes, but he needs to do it *every* time. Doing it sometimes shows her that the rest of the time it still works to keep guilting him and pushing those boundaries. So she'll keep doing it. If he does it *every. single. time, s*he'll start to figure out it doesn't work at all and maybe she'll stop doing it. He also needs to confront her straight on about how she's guilting him to manipulate and control him and that her behavior isn't appropriate and won't be tolerated.

Ask her why she thinks that. And or ask her to stop making suggestions about your marriage.\n\nLike, 99% of these issues are person 1 is doing something wrong.

Especially if it was conscious, and she passed up opportunities.   By and large many of the issues with child abuse and sexual abuse stem not from the bio parent but from a stepparent who has access to a child not their own in a family home situation. It introduces a whole other level of complexity and dynamic to introduce a step parent. Sure it\u2019s easier for the single parent. They have a partner, but not always beneficial to the child and often not. It\u2019s a wild card.  There are exceptions and many examples where a step parent can be loving and  beneficial but in a sadly large majority of cases it\u2019s not so sunny. \n\nIn any case she did this consciously and she\u2019s proud of it as an accomplishment with meaning so it\u2019s mean spirited for you to knock it down and discount it.

Society as a whole is hot wired to value family as much as possible, even to a toxic degree, and so for many they can\u2019t just brush off or leave when a family member is making them angry, and sometimes it just blows up when you least expect it. I\u2019m not condoning OP\u2019s actions, but I truly understand their frustration. To not agree otherwise is saying that you would allow the MIL toxic behavior and I cannot allow that myself.\n\nAnd, Omg you\u2019re right, my 2 posts of a video game is TOO much, I must tone it down a notch. If your response is only to try and insult me by looking at my posts, what are you doing with your life.", "Yeesh, imagine having your hobbies determine your age. My bad. What hobbies are appropriate for adults, by your standard?", "op should not have to make any excuse for wanting to go.  certainly not to MIL. \n\nthe MIL just kept pushing and from the sound ofi t it's what she's done since the wedding. op just finally pushed back. NTA", "Not a single thing you wrote there has anything to do with your accusation that the other poster was 'angry' or 'lost their cool'.\n\nI assume you now recognise your claim was incorrect."]}
