She doesn't need to worry about what you do and where you go, her throwing a tantrum is not justified. You yelling back at her is also unjustified and frankly mean. I don't understand the full situation but we don't know why she stayed alone and that she might not have even considered it being about sex. I understand your viewpoint but you have better ways of communication", "ESH. \nShe is overstepping boundaries. \nYour husband is spineless. \nYou are rude, unkind, and frankly petty.", "YTA. What a weird thing to say.", "ESH. Your MIL is clearly manipulative and has no right to interfere in your marriage or your sex life. \n\nShe needs to stop guilt-tripping your husband and accept that he is an adult who can make his own decisions. \n\nIn addition you went too far by shouting at her and insulting her personal choices. You could have been more civil and assertive without being rude and hurtful.\n\n You stooped to her level and escalated the conflict.", "Mellow drama? More like melodrama!\n\nYTA \u2026 potentially. I think you need to elaborate more on the tantrum and what it had to do with his work trip and your tagging along, because it sounds like you just wanted to tell her you bang her son to make her jealous in some way.", "Lol'ing at 'mellow drama.' There's drama, but like, it's pretty chill \ud83e\udd23", "YTA - What a weird thing to say and also kind of pathetic you can't keep it in your pants for 20 days", "YTA. You went a bit nuclear on her. Sure, she\u2019s preachy, but what you said was just damn mean.", "Single doesnt automatically mean sexless, and we know she had it at least once in her life, huh? \n\nESH", "ESH where tf did sex come into the picture?  Shes forcing her trauma onto you guys and he is not standing up to his mom. You def seem to hate her though. Learn to deal with it and maybe ask your husband to stand up for you both.", "YTA\n\nShe had no business telling you any of that but you sure are a piece of work", "YTA. WTAF is wrong with you?", "YTA here is my reason. You might not know the reason she stayed single. But I don't think you should have yelled at her like that. I kinda get the feeling you fly off the handle a lot. Like people gotta watch what they say or do around you. Like you have no filter. It's just the impression I'm getting from you", "YTA. You should have just not interacted with her and let your husband deal with her. Next time, just leave the room. There was no reason to bring your sex life up in front of this woman. It was a legit weird thing to do.", "Mellow drama! \n\nLolllll..  made me laugh.", "Not sure why so many people are blaming you for her behaviour. I\u2019d say NTA because she has no right to interfere with your marriage and sex life. She made her choices and that\u2019s fine but she shouldn\u2019t be acting like that. I think a lot of mothers just can\u2019t accept that their sons have married and they are no longer the number one priority. She sounds a bit pathetic tbh and I\u2019m sorry you have to put up with her behaviour.", "Nta. She needs to back off.", "NTA - why is everyone saying Y T A??? The MIL had no right to criticize op \u2018s choice to go with her husband on the trip, if MIL had minded her own business she wouldn\u2019t have gotten an earful.", "NTA. She has had years to grow the hell up (raising a child alone doesn\u2019t make you emotionally mature or responsible) and your husband has had plenty time to set a boundary the appropriate way. If you have had to put up with this behavior because \u201cthat\u2019s just the way she is\u201d, maybe this can be a wake up call to them that you can be \u201cthey way you are\u201d too unless they are ready to make some changes. And before I get any \u201ctypical Redditor\u201d comments, since I appear to hold the unpopular opinion, I have been in a healthy marriage with boundaries for our weird ass families for over a decade. Sometimes you gotta make a point reeeeal clear before people understand there is gonna be a change in dynamics, and their behavior is what got y\u2019all to that point. Sucks to suck sometimes!", "ESH. She was majorly overstepping, clearly over a long while. While you were right to put her in her place (which is outside of your marriage), you took it much further than needed.", "Shock value does have a place in the communication arena. However, it doesn't sound like you and your husband have tried to set boundaries with her or took other steps to get her to change her behaviour. You just abruptly pulled out the rude and crude with no warning.

She didn\u2019t have a bf or husband because she had her son, some weird meshed relationship where he fills the gap that she actually wants filled by a relationship. She made him her only priority and world, and now someone\u2019s his world - she can\u2019t deal with it. \n\nIt also must be hard to hear for your husband that she stayed single for her son, like the son owes her or something. \n\nYour husband is TA for not setting boundaries and allowing all this drama", "wow this comeback was trashy af. you have nothing to do with her sexlife, she has nothing to do with yours. I could never look in her eyes after this. And actually I couldn't look into my husband's eyes either for a long time... you put him in a very awkward position. Also I think it's not normal to not be able to wait for your husband for 20 days.", "ESH but more you. Yea, she sounds difficult: that's where your husband needs to buck up and tell her to back off.\n\n'i shouted at her \u201cIf you stayed single sexless for your entire life, thats your choice, but i want my husband and i want sex thats why i am going with him!'\n\nThis was just deranged.", "In this instance YTA, there's putting someone in their place and whatever it is you did... You admit you don't know the reasons why she stayed single, if she felt it was better/safer to not have a man in her life there's could be a big ass reason for it.\n\nHow she has been acting prior to that is unacceptable and is up to your husband to deal with, he needs to set boundaries with her and stick to them. He probably needs therapy to deal with it all.", "ESH. MIL seems overbearing and giving opinions where theh aren't needed and YOU... Well what a very strange gross thing to say to your husbands mother. And your husband needs to be less spineless and stand his ground when standing up for you when MIL is poking her nose into your marriage.", "ESH awfully proud of your own drama and toxicity, looks like your husband did that thing where you think you\u2019re marrying the opposite of your parent but you\u2019re marrying the same damn person sucks to be him", "You should have posted this in that MIL subreddit because a lot of people here are MILs and old people who won't understand how hard is dealing with this type of behavior. I get why you reacted the way you did. NTA.", "NTA Tell her to back the eff up. If she can't bud out, you are more than welcome to stand up for yourself.", "NTA but I do think it needs to be said that you had that \"outburst\" because things are where they are. You seem level headed and your husband seems decent but you got to this point because you don't have the support you fully deserve. There's no simple answer as to how to navigate dealing with a MIL relationship but don't look at this through rose colored glasses and see what it is you need to say to your husband to make sure you know you are priority #1", "YTA  you shouldn\u2019t have said that but I also burst out laughing. Best to apologise and move on.", "NTA - her choice to quite literally suckle your husband while he was growing up. \nProbably didn\u2019t need to drop the sex line but I get your frustration. \nI feel like most people saying YTA haven\u2019t had to deal with a neurotic In law. \nMe Ex\u2019s mum used to belittle and be overly mean to me at every chance she had, but I wasn\u2019t fussed because I used to spit in the cups of tea I made her :) apples and oranges.", "ESH\n\nThe only thing that doesn't suck is 'mellow drama' which I love.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t think what you said is bad tbh", "ESH - why has your husband not gone to counseling? why are you staying with someone who allows others to act that way towards you?", "I\u00b4d say NTA, maybe not the right way of phrasing it, but you MIL kinda had it coming lol.", "NTA-\nI suggest the raised by narcissist reddit for your husband. He might have a big eye opening moment if he reads some posts and see's how closely his story fit with others. \n\nFor you I suggest gray Rock methods or getting back at them with kindness. Your MIL acts the same way my mom does and I'm so sorry you have to go through that. You don't deserve her freak outs and episode's. she is looking for a response or some type of reaction, ignoring her and looking \"through\" her as if she wasn't there will kill her when she is trying to get at you. Don't forget to laugh. Look for patterns in her behavior and you will start to laugh at how much time she will spend on trying to get at you and not focus on her self. \n\nThe best thing to do if it gets to a point where she contiues to disrespect you and your relationship with your husband is going no contact if both of you are on the same page. \n\nBest of luck and kudos to you for saying that to MIL.", "NTA. It had to be said!", "I was a single mum for 2 years, I knew my kids needed a father figure so I met someone I knew was good enough for them.

Personally I am not in a relationship but when I do go over to.. you know - she pulls the card about me sleeping around. Even though it happens very rarely, and sometimes the situation is just me and a guy friend legitimately just hanging out. For this experience and knowing how you feel, giving NTA. But it does depend a lot on your relationship with your MIL outside of this which is not completely explained. Info - is she one of those people who just can't stand being alone? Because I can understand that stance but it still doesn't make it okay. And she may be using her son as one of her few social interactions which you've made her feel isolated from. Being a single mom is not easy, and doesn't provide a lot of social opportunities.

You shouldn\u2019t have brought your sex life with her son into the conversation. However she is clearly over-stepping her boundaries and so she is also an AH. You should learn to respond to her in a way that keeps your boundaries firm and is less negative. Honestly, I would go to a counsellor to help me deal with her.

You have no clue what she does in her free time. Banging her son trying to rub it in her face shows your lack of boundaries and almost like you are making it to be some competition with his mom. Just ew all around.", "I mean eh. Your MIL has formed emotional incest with your husband, she views him as her partner that\u2019s why her actions to you have become increasingly toxic since your marriage. Your husband is spineless and you should have a serious conversation with him about it. I don\u2019t exactly think you went as low as her but it wasn\u2019t the best thing to say.

It's easy to judge some one on their reaction to one situation when it seems that this is a repeated situation for OP. They shouldn't be made to feel like crap or deemed the AH over being fed up with MIL . If the MIL didn't want to have stuff said in response to her comments she shouldn't of said anything.
