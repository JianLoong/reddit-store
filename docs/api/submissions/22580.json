And on the petty scale; this isn't that bad (what you did).", "NTA, people in glass houses should not throw stones. Its time he learned that lesson.", "NTA, nice lil petty revenge. Bet he'll think twice before badgering you and YOUR life choices that have 0 effect on his personal life.", "NTA - \"moment of weakness\"?? \"moment of hardness\" you mean", "Nothing like taking down someone preaching from a high horse  with their own hypocrisy.\n\nNTA  Keep your kid away from him until your brother matures.  He'll just fill your kid's head with how immoral you and GF are.\n\nBesides, he should turn the other cheek.  Forgive and forget, right?", "Turnabout is always fair play.", "INFO What did telling on him get you? You don't care about pre marital sex. It won't change his mind.\n\nDo you live at home?

Your brother is immature for his view of the world, but I don't think involving your parents without talking it out with him is any more mature.", "YTA. So glad someone as *mature* as you planned on impregnating his girlfriend at the ripe old age of 23. JFC.

You must have done some masterful financial planning!\n\nYTA for snitching on your brother.  Don\u2019t be a snitch.", "lol you're this petty and you seriously think you're ready to be a dad? \n\nYTA", "ESH. You're brother is a hypocrite for judging you if he had a girl over himself. (And even if he hadn't, he should keep his remarks to himself.) You suck for getting your brother in trouble instead of just talking to him and telling him to stop those comments.", "ESH . How old are you ? This reads like a squabble between two 5 yr olds.", "YTA. \n\nYou know what's easier and more effective than being petty? Just walking away. Because that's what adults do. They don't engage emotional terrorists, they simply walk away because when you don't engage and give a bully what they want, they have no ammo. You're going to be a parent, so it's time you grew up.", "Yeah. Are you mature enough to have a child? C\u2019mon. You say you\u2019re okay with living your life differently from your strict parents, but can\u2019t afford your little brother his freedoms?\n\nYTA. \n\nYou could have talked with him and told him to back off his judginess, but instead you rattled like a 10 year old.", "ESH. You might get a few NTAs due to the religion aspect, but everyone in this story is the AH", "I'm with Lostinfrills. Your brother is immature and will learn some hard life lessons soon enough. But he doesn't need to learn them from you necessarily. He should be able to trust you and feel like he can come to you in times of need. Tattleing on your brother, which is what you did, isn't really a sign of maturity. I see all types of ages and relationships in my job (ob ultrasound), so your situation is not abnormal at all. And I do understand how \"high and mighty\" people can be annoying. They're really usually terrible hypocrites, but in this situation, you really should've taken the higher road. I'm going with ESH here because yes, your brother is annoying, but you're going to be a dad soon, and you're going to have to learn to ignore little jabs like that. Kids can be hard; you're going to have to thicken your skin.", "YTA.  If you aren't willing to commit to a partner enough to marry, you aren't willing to make enough of a commitment to the partner to have a child with them.  I am all for not getting married.  Kids out of wedlock happen and I do not believe people should get married because they got pregnant.  That is entirely different than planning on having a baby without being committed to your partner.  The telling on your brother just confirms that you are not mature enough to be in a committed relationship nor ready to have a child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
