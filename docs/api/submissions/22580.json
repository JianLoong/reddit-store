They need consequences. \n\nI'm happy to be the one to deliver the consequences while everyone else just sits around and helps them become worse by doing nothing.", "Guess we found the tattle tale", "\ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2d\ud83d\ude1c", "Nah, hypocrites deserves comeuppance :) especially the religious hypocrites", "I dont know how you consider this YTA. His brother got involved in stuff that wasn\u2019t of his concern, and he found out the consequences. Perfect example of FAAFO. Were the actions of OP petty? Yes. But cmon. No way he\u2019s YTA. NTA for me.", "Seconded. Is the little brother being safe? Catholic sex-ed is infamous for being terrible, and somehow I don't see uber-conservative parents teaching them about condoms, pre-cum containing sperm, or anything at all about safe sex beyond \"Don't Do It.\" I get that the kid is being an annoying, holier-than-thou hypocrite, who's probably an adult in name only. OP is human and sick of this. \n\nYet, instead of being an adult and making this a teachable moment for the little brother, OP escalated by bringing in the parents and ensuring that his little brother never trusts him, no matter how much he may need to. Instead of having a less extreme older adult to confide in, the little brother now has every adult doubling down on him, all in negative ways.  OP, if you're about to be a parent, perhaps consider this a dry-run for when you have to deal with a hormonal teenager doing something stupid. Best of luck, but right now ESH.", "The other option would have been to turn to him anytime he's trying to shame you and tell him \"I don't give a flying f@#$ what you think about it.\" and end the conversation.", "Wtf does that even mean? He was slightly petty. Oh no it's the end of the world, he'll be the worst parent ever guaranteed!!!", "Being petty comes with the potential of the bro learning his lesson and minding his business going forward, walking away guarantees it will keep happening. So no nta", "Ooo. I learned the term \u201cdobbing\u201d from watching Bluey with my kid lol.", "Apparently OP is old enough to be starting a family, yet he still has to have mommy and daddy fight his fight with his brother for him.", "A few \ud83d\ude02", "I have many friends whose parents didnt get married and planned the kids. Parents still arent married and they're still together. Heck my own partners parents aren't married but have been together over 30 years and had 2 kids. Seems pretty committed to me. \n\nThere are different types of committed relationships not all of them get to marriage but there are plenty that last a lifetime wothout being married. You dont need to be married to be committed and you certianly dont need to be engaged or married to show youre \"mature\" enough to have a child. \n\nMaybe OP and his GF dont want to be married. Maybe they dont want the church involved in their relationship. Whatever their reason its valid.", "So you\u2019re telling me when my partner and I were together for 7 years (now 9.5) who don\u2019t plan on getting married shouldn\u2019t have planned on having a kid together, but it would have been okay if we had one on accident? Jeeze, guess I should keep that in mind when \u2018practicing\u2019 for our second.", "Lol", "It\u2019s a cult like any other", "Nah, only the real zealots. We're cool. I went to a an all girls Catholic school run by nuns. The only times we went to church was at Christmas and Easter.  Most had a boyfriend by 16/17. No weird rules besides the school uniform.The one rule that had me scratching my head was no red clothing/accessories. Because of communism I think. We're talking about the 80s here.", "It\u2019s a feature not a bug", "Rules for thee but not for me and all that jazz.", "So true. How often have we heard the \"Having sex with children is wrong...unless you're a priest or nun,\" line. \n\nSeems a bit silly, really to think you could be the worst human imaginable, but still get into heaven if you say sorry on your death bed.", "Damn! If I had any of John Oliver's coins, I'd throw them at you. Brutal.", "\n\n If you're that secure in your personal freedoms choices.", "Sorry that happened to you, but glad your mother had your back, and saw how narrow-minded her statements were", "I hate when they say that. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s God\u2019s will. It\u2019s that God gave us all freedom of choice and someone\u2019s shitty ass choice ruined ur life. Someone used their free will to take away your and God does not approve of that. And I wish that\u2019s how they explained it.", "He's 18, not 11.  Talking shit to other people sometimes comes with consequences.  The brother is going to have to learn sooner or later that sometimes things can and do come back to bite you in the ass, especially if you are a hypocrite.", "His brother did not get involved. He simply expressed his opinions. OP could have just told him to STFU or ignore him instead of having mom and dad settle the argument for him. \n\nHe is starting his own family but can't handle hearing words he doesn't like. OP needs to grow up.", "Or loudly say \"Well you're one to talk since you did the same thing yourself\" every time he brings it up so that he knows if he continues saying anything you will be talking about it loudly and if he doesn't want mom and dad to hear, he better not bring it up again. \n\nBut I guess OP is old enough to be a dad but not old enough to handle a disagreement with their little bro without running to mom and dad out of pettiness.", "[deleted]", "Just because you grew up in a relaxed Catholic community doesn\u2019t mean that the entire religion is \u201ccool\u201d. And I\u2019d be willing to bet that some people you grew up with had entirely different experiences.\n\nIt largely abuses children, subjugates women, promotes overpopulation\u2026\n\nEdit: Fictional christ on a cracker, people. I specified Catholic because that\u2019s the belief system being discussed in this particular comment thread. I don\u2019t have a particular hate for Catholicism. I think all religions are cultist garbage.", "I also went to a catholic school run by nuns and it was completely opposite to how you describe. Happy to hear there\u2019s some places that are chill but a surprising number still are borderline cultish", "I mean, we are talking about the same god that drowned the majority of people (children included) and killed innocent first born sons...", "Younger brother isn't judging to get a reaction. You think when that YB judges someone's poor choices like a celeb on tv or a cousin or a girl on the street they are looking for a reaction? No they are just judging for the sake of, not necessarily a reaction. So your opinion on what the best solution may be isn't as sound as you think and you should be open to the possibility that you're wrong.", "The brother is religious and judgmental. The reaction he wants is op to live like he tells him too. And as someone who has lived with people like this for the first 21 years of my life until i could escape( and who still lives in an area where this is the norm) THEY NEVER FUCKING GIVE UP. So yeah being mean enough that they get the message is the only way sometimes to convince them to back off because they genuinely believe that they are doing whats best for you. This isn't a high school bully looking for a reaction, it's a zealot who thinks you don't know what's best for you.", "You\u2019re describing most religions, not just Catholicism, and none of them are cool", "....So just like like protestants?", "This is literally all religions? I don't get why reddit seems to focus on Catholics? Like are you kidding me? You're going to tell me Islam and Judaism and everything else doesn't also abuse kids, women and promotes overpopulation? Judaism literally promotes having as many children as possible... Point being all religions are basically awful.", "I think you underestimate how liberal western Europe is compared to the US. \nReligious fanatics are everywhere but they're very hard to find here and they for sure don't send their kids to Catholic school because by now they're even co-ed.\n\nIt largely abuses children, subjugates women, promotes overpopulation\u2026\n\nYeah this can be said of literally every religion out there. That's why I hate them all equally.", "I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe it's because I'm European. Most are just Catholic in name only and have been for a very long time.unless maybe the Italians and Polish.", "[deleted]", "Yea, I\u2019m pretty anti religion in general. I\u2019m just directly addressing Catholicism because that\u2019s what the comment I replied to was talking about.", "Good gravy, I specified Catholicism because that was the sect that was being discussed. Yes, I honestly believe all religions are awful, too.", "I\u2019m from the UK, never sure whether that classes as European or not but it\u2019s not exactly a catholic country overall. This school was just an outlier haha, although I know there are schools run by the same organisation in France despite being a very secular country these days .\n\nSorry by the way , I am pleased you had a good experience at your school, mine was just very different and I have a significant chip on my shoulder as a result of it", "Classic. You don't care that much because everything you said was shot down and you're salty. No one cares if you think op isn't mature enough for a kid.", "Of course you're European. I'm so sorry for your bad experience at school. Don't these zealots realise that the more they push, the more you get turned off by their religion? I hope you are ok now.", "Haha glad I wasn't the only person who thought that. People always take the time to let others know there don't care but people who truly don't care just don't engage, the people who start writing a comment then going ah fk it and delete it", "Exactly!"]}
