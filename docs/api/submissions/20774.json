Then, you need to come up with another excuse.... until you are worn down and out of excuses and give in.\n\nThe trick is to not play the game. When you are asked, just say, \"sorry, but it just isn't possible\" and stop talking.  If the other person says \"why not?\", just repeat it again, \"sorry, but I simply can't. I'm sure you understand\".  If they persist, keep saying the above until they give up.
