It was also the first time my dad had met her in person. He had only told us about her a few days prior to meeting her and only because he needed my car to pick her up. \n\nHe had invited her to go to a family party and so she was going to spend the weekend. I wasn\u2019t okay with this since he had only started talking to her a week prior. My siblings and I went to the store and when we came home on Friday she was there along with her kids, which we had no idea were coming. \n\nThen she came along the next weekend, I took her to the store because my dad asked me too, other than some small talk though I haven\u2019t really interacted with them. \n\nYesterday my dad asked me to babysit her kids all next week since both him and her were going on a trip, I refused and he kept asking. When he finally accepted my answer he went and asked my brother who agreed hesitantly. \n\nAn hour went by and then he came outside to give us a lecture about how we should be opening up to her and bonding with them. How he was trying to be a better father since we asked him too (nothing has changed he still isn\u2019t around, he missed my graduation, and constantly ignores our calls).How we don\u2019t want him to be happy. How he may have cheated on my mom constantly especially when she was in the hospital but how her death (she passed in November) devastated him. How since he found love again we should support him. How he accepted my sister\u2019s boyfriend into the family and we should do the same to his girlfriend. \n\nMy siblings and I kept quiet since arguing with him just makes him try to out the blame on us. Once he was done he went inside and my siblings agreed that he shouldn\u2019t have lectured us and he was out of line. But I felt kind of guilty but my sister said I shouldn\u2019t since he is trying to force us to bond with a woman we\u2019ve only met twice.
