Growing up , he was rarely physically present for us. He did pay child support and helped us with education expenses but it always looked liked he was being the 'dad' in our lives by using his money only and not actually being there for us. \n\n\n\nI sent him my wedding invitation and he said he will surely come (He only lives at one hour drive away from us.) My mom made me ask him if he is willing to walk me down the aisle and secretly I wanted that too but he politely refused which was of course very hurtful but I let it go and one of my brothers volunteered for this. \n\n\n\n\nOn the eve of wedding , he called my mom to say that he can't come because his wife has fever. That was honestly my breaking point. It would be an acceptable excuse if she was actually really sick but just down with FEVER and he is ready to skip his only daughter's wedding.\n\nHe asked my mom if he could talk to me since I wasn't picking up his calls and mom refused because she was just as hurt. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe sent cash as gift on my wedding day and I sent it back because accepting it would be a slap on my face I think. I texted him that I am not that little girl anymore who he could make it up to using money and blocked him . I do not know if I overreacted but I am beyond frustrated and hurt by his behaviour. \n\n\n\n\nA few days later , he showed up at my house with a gift in kind this time and it was expensive. He apologised for not showing up earlier . I was more angry at him again bringing gift than not coming to the wedding that I blew up . I told him he failed as a father and he needs to stop trying to make up everytime using his money. \n\nHe got mad at me and told my husband(29) to fix my attitude . \nMy husband replied that its not attitude but resentment towards him for never being there for me. \n\n\n\n\n\nNow my dad is super mad at all of us and told my mom that he was trying to 'fix' his relationship with me and wanted to be on good terms with my husband and I let this situation escalate to the point where my husband sees him as a bad father . Now he has not only a damaged relationship with his only daughter but he is also disliked by his son in law. It seems to me that he is more concerned about what my husband thinks of him than me being upset because of him. \n\n\n\n\n\nMy mom who was not present there believes I misbehaved with my dad and made my husband disrespect him . I do not know what to feel anymore. My mom thinks I am the one at fault this time and I should've just accepted his apology and gift and my dad is acting all hurt and upset. My husband thinks he does not deserve to stay in my life .\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\n\n\n***(Sorry for a long post .

Some single mothers have to move to a less safe area if child support is not paid. If he helped you with college expenses you do not have student loans as high as they would have been without the help and that is a big deal for a young married couple. Money isn't everything, but your father did contribute to your safe well-being. Nothing excuses ditching your wedding and you let him know how you felt. He still acknowledges you as his daughter. Have a heart-to-heart talk with him and tell him you were devastated by his absence at your wedding. It isn't worth going no-contact with him over your wedding. There are worse situations to go NC.

Or should I say \u201cfather.\u201c\n\n\u201cDad, I don\u2019t know what your damage is, and I\u2019ve realize that I\u2019ve gotten to a point where I just don\u2019t care. As much as I yearn for a relationship with you, no matter how low I said the power you manage to fail.\"\n\n\u201c I don\u2019t know why mom insisted that I ask you to walk me down the aisle, but I really actually wanted you to. The question is why do you claim the mantle of fatherhood when you don\u2019t want to actually be a father or a dad or anything??\"\n\n\"You hurt me by not wanting to walk me down the aisle. But you destroyed me by not even showing up on my wedding for some lame excuse like your wife wasn\u2019t feeling well. It\u2019s clear you didn\u2019t wanna be there, but then you show up with money and a gift, why did you bother driving to deliver this gift that I didn\u2019t ask for, when you couldn\u2019t bother to be there even for the ceremony when I was getting married?\"\n\n\"you think showing up with an expensive present is the same thing as \u201ctrying to fix the relationship,\u201c and then you cry to my mom? why don\u2019t you apologize and explain yourself?\"\n\n\u201cnow you\u2019re telling my husband to keep me in line? You\u2019re all butt hurt that I don\u2019t want your fake apology and make up gift? I guess I\u2019m grateful at least you did your duty financially. and maybe I should just be open to you sending checks every so often, but it\u2019s not the same thing as having a relationship, and it\u2019s not a way to fix anything.\"\n\n\u201cIf you actually want to relationship with me then you better change the way you deal with me and you were better come equipped with more than a check, there better be an apology and a plan for us to have a relationship. Because if you think you\u2019re going to have anything to do with me or my family or my kids, no matter how much money you have, that is not happening. so either own up and let\u2019s move forward or let\u2019s call it a day, not every relationship was meant to last forever.\"", "Man this comment hits home. My dad hasn\u2019t lived in the same state as me since I was 10. In his mind we have a great father-son relationship. But for me, it isn\u2019t easy to have a strong relationship with someone who I mainly interact with through a phone. I just take the relationship as it is and go from there. You can\u2019t be disappointed if you don\u2019t have expectations.", "I can attest to this. I had to go NC with my dad twice because all I got from our relationship was pressure to conform to his idea of me and stress because that wasn't me. Growing up my dad was more concerned with how others viewed him than actually being a good dad. He'd give the shirt off his back to a far away acquaintance, but everything was too much effort to do for me (or my sister).\n\nAfter I went NC for the second time and my bf and I were watching movies or shows with an asshole dad character in them my bf would hug me because he was afraid that would trigger me. And it never did, bad dad characters never bothered me. I would however bawl uncontrollably over amazing dad characters, because it hurt that my dad couldn't be that way with me, and couldn't love me enough to be the same good person as with everybody else.\n\nAnd it's so so hard to shatter that image of your parent \"maybe next time he'll make an effort\". Im really proud of OP for standing up for herself.", "Apologists are worse than abusers sometimes.", "That and the mother telling her she's in the wrong. She absolutely isn't. Sorry Dad, you don't deserve a place in OPs life. NTA and well done to your husband for having your back. Block your dad and tell your mum to start supporting you or she'll end up blocked too. She should be outraged on your behalf not trying to keep the peace with a man who's never there for you.", "You are describing my father. He thought giving us money, etc would always excuse his poor treatment of my mom, me & my brother. It was painful and sad, for all of us.", "Thank you, I'm glad someone else saw the fever thing and realized that not attending the wedding was the right call.", "Came looking for this comment. The dad could be TA in a lot of ways, but if someone told me someone in their household had a fever and then showed up at my wedding, I would be upset.", "Yeah, I have no complaints about someone being thoughtful enough to play safe with a fever and on *only* that point is OP TA for wanting to risk potential exposure to all the other attendees. \n\nBig picture though, the real problem here is if course that dad has a long history of not showing up, literally and figuratively. If this has been the first issue she might have been very sad he couldn't be there  but still okay with it based on safety. But she had already been emotionally abandoned by him for years, *he said no* to walking her down the aisle (what the *actual* fuck), *and then* he didn't show! No wonder she reached her breaking point! He's definitely the AH, and if the reason he ultimately ends up with a daughter NC with him is the one time he had a good reason, well, it was stacked on top of years of bad or no reasons. He only had himself to blame when the whole stack falls at once and square on his head.", "She did not have Covid. My mom asked him . He just did not want to leave her alone when she's sick .That was his explanation.", "I think that if it was COVID he would have said that it was COVID but it looks like it was just a regular fever.  You know people still get those and it has nothing to do with having COVID.", "Ever heard of masks?", "If she was so sick that she couldn't be left alone, she should have gone to the hospital. If he suspected she had covid, he should have said so.", "Um... Masks?", "She has the right to be angry and it's ok, is better than act  like everything is fine when it's not, this is not the church of Jesus where we forgive everyone, and a fever is something minor, there is medicine, it feels bad but not that bad to have someone besides you and you can avoid that feeling maybe not getting drunk next time.", "My children will come before every partner I will ever have. As they should.", "For a fever?  You\u2019d skip your daughters wedding?  Have your wife take some ibuprofen and acetaminophen and sleep it off.  No big deal.  And it was the night before, no reason to assume she\u2019d have one the next day, and if even if she did\u2026not a big deal unless the concern is Covid.\n\nIt sounds like he was looking for a reason not to go.  So, he found one.  Not even a good one.\n\nOp, drop the ball.  Keep doing what you\u2019ve done and don\u2019t allow him to hurt you more.  Your mother is wrong.  Your dad sucks.", "I can\u2019t imagine going through life so delicate and fragile over an adult with a fever. Yikes.", "Seems we found the loser dad", "> Do you remember the feeling of having a fever? My own temperature is slightly elevated right now because I drank last night and I feel so hot and sluggish and just terrible. Now imagine a fever?\n\nSo take some cold medicine and sleep all day. What kind of adult can't be left alone when they only have a fever?", "This kind of dad doesn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help to look bad in front of his new son in law.\n\n\u201cFinds Someone Else to Walk You Down the Aisle,\u201d and \u201cSkip the Wedding\u201d followed by \u201cControl Your Woman.\u201d Dude plays *all* the hits!\n\nNTA", "I'd burn houses down with that kind of response. \n\n1: I'm not someone's ward to control\n\n2: my relationship with my parent (in this hypothetical situation) does not include my SO\n\n3: I'm a whole ass human by myself. \n\nActually, ignore 1 and 2\n\n3 covers it", "But she's worth knowing now she's attached to a man.............", "And he seems more concerned about the husband\u2019s opinion of him than his own daughter\u2019s! What an absolute dropkick. \n\nOP, I\u2019m going to paraphrase a quote that really connected for me in regards to my own asshole father: \u201cHe may have been your father, but he wasn\u2019t your daddy.\u201d", "Yup that comment would\u2019ve pushed me over the edge", "More like she's a machine that needs a wrench. FIX it! Ridiculous that he thinks he can control his son-in-law while insulting and using his daughter as a pawn. He knows exactly what he did but is only upset that he cannot buy your forgiveness. This wasn't a little oopsie like a dinner with him alone, this was your WEDDING and used a very weak excuse that could easily be a lie. NTA.", "> And god forbid he feel that way, so he's blaming it all on you for not accepting his attempts to ~~be a better dad~~ buy your love.  \n\nFTFY.", "But people like that know that they should attend their own children's weddings. Giving some excuse about the wife being sick, which I don't buy for a second, is bullshit.", "If his love language was gifts, that would probably also include a bit of love there. So, no I don't think his love language is gifts", "I've seen it, and my guess is that they spent a lot of time *before* the divorce going to bat for their husbands and doing damage control. Telling the kids they're overreacting to dad's behavior, telling friends/family that their dear husband didn't really mean that, he's actually great, etc. Then the husband leaves, and they have to face if maybe they were wrong about the guy and everyone else was right...or just continue the denial because it would be too painful to admit you spent so many years standing up for a prick.", "This is a good analysis.  Indeed, mom has issues for her to chastise you on behalf of her ex.", "Wonder how many times the dad used that technique on the mom while they were married. Apparently it's super effective.", "Thank you so much for your comment. I really hope I find it in myself to tell my parents this. But right now, I do not want to talk to both of them because I know I need a break from this to focus on my new life .", "Well said!", "Great username!", "He had no issue showing up at her house a few days later though..", "Agreed!", "Yea agreed", "That\u2019s helpful to know.\n\nSo, there are a few things I want to say, in hopes that they\u2019ll help you navigate your feelings on this (and, if you so choose, have a conversation with him).\n\n1. Firstly, I want to be clear that my other points are not intended to suggest that you can\u2019t be upset. In my experience, when dealing with selfish and toxic people it\u2019s absolutely crucial to know exactly what they did wrong before you try to talk to them about it. Otherwise, you leave them the opportunity to make a logical and valid argument against the part you complained about, and it throws you too off-balance to hold your ground on the real problem. I\u2019m worried you\u2019ll tell him he should have come anyway, leaving him the chance to make a reasonable argument about why that wasn\u2019t a real option, when really this is about a much bigger pattern of abandonment. So with that said:\n\n2. Remember that COVID isn\u2019t the only contagious condition that causes a fever. Unless they knew the cause was not contagious, not attending was the respectful thing to do not only for you, but also for all your guests who may have been less comfortable with that risk than you are. Strep throat, the flu, etc are not fun for anyone, and weddings usually have attendees with a range of health needs.\n\n3. Keep in mind that fevers can be scary, and it sounds like you\u2019re getting some of his explanations indirectly. It\u2019s difficult because everyone\u2019s experienced a mild fever where they just needed to hydrate and get extra rest, but fevers can get worse quickly and become medical emergencies (risking seizures, brain damage, etc). If no one else could have been with her, this may have been less about babying her and more about making sure she had help if it did get worse. I was once with someone when their fever went from 100.2 to 104+  in less than 10 minutes; they had to be rushed to the hospital and could have died. If she was responding well to acetaminophen and had only a low-grade fever, then I find it harder to sympathize, but if her fever had been over 102, I can understand wanting to monitor and be sure she was safe.\n\nOverall, I think the real problem here probably has more to do with his pattern of neglect than this specific incident. If he were a wonderful and attentive father, then I think this would be much easier to understand, and I suspect that if he\u2019d posted his side of events in this sub people would be telling him that it was an impossible situation and he had an obligation to be sure his wife was safe. Try to remember that he didn\u2019t just mail the gift or send you a check; he came in person. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to want him around, but it is a step above just throwing money at the problem. I think it\u2019s worth considering that staying home with his wife *might* have been the right decision; but that doesn\u2019t invalidate everything you\u2019re feeling, and it doesn\u2019t change the harm he\u2019s done.", "I mean, personally I wouldn\u2019t want anything that causes a fever at my wedding, and I\u2019d be waiting for a negative PCR test before feeling sure it wasn\u2019t COVID, but maybe I\u2019m more cautious about it than others", "Not in every country you can go out with covid symptoms. Not even with a mask.\nJust saying.", "I didn\u2019t get drunk. Bold of you to assume. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you drink, the standard 2 beers will do that do you asshole.", "He clearly doesn\u2019t care for her though. Can\u2019t for that on someone. Some people don\u2019t want kids. Sounds like he didn\u2019t. He paid child support and gave money but he clearly doesn\u2019t care to be a PARENT. If someone got pregnant and I didn\u2019t want the kid, then the kid can fuck off. I\u2019ll pay child support.", "Estranged* daughter. Sounds like he\u2019s trying to be nice not be her dad. He\u2019s just a sperm donor it seems.", "I can\u2019t imagine being so fragile over someone who clearly doesn\u2019t want me. She needs to wake up. It\u2019s reality. That it hurts people feelings is beyond me. Grow up.", "A nice. An insult by another justifying asshole.", "I wanna ask OP if we might be sisters because this is the same crap my sperm donor would pull.  Except he is always broke so he wouldn't show up with an expensive gift but if he had any money he would try to bribe you with it.", "Dude first of all, there\u2019s a chance of COVID. Second my estranged daughter can eat a bag of eggplants. I\u2019m not gonna put myself somewhere I don\u2019t want to go. My wife getting a fever would be a saving grace. That\u2019s why my wife\u2019s my angel. Weddings are fucking awkward for people who are forced to be there.", "Yeah, I'm pretty sure he never planned to attend the wedding, and that's why he turned down walking OP down the aisle. If he'd really wanted to be there, he would have jumped at the opportunity. Also, I doubt the wife had a fever.", "At least he didn't try to control what sort of feminine hygiene products she uses??", "True but her husband is a hero and the real man in this situation to call out his FIL on his crap. We, as woman, are wholly individual but sometimes a hubby pitch hitting can be a good thing.", "No she's not. It's the man that's the one worth knowing. I can almost hear him saying \"but my only son-in-law!\"", "YUP.  Good correction.", "Well shit\u2026..I guess ppl don\u2019t want to see another point of view. Oh well, good thing I don\u2019t live for upvotes \ud83d\ude44", "NTA you don't have an attitude, you're just gently closing the door he tried to slam shut then fling back open.  You are not a child, your worth is not linked to a SO. This man hurt you over and over and your family allowed it because society used to tell us that something was always better than nothing. Except, it isnt. Sometimes nothing is tbe healthiest choice but thats your decision alone to make.\nPs, congratulations on your marriage, may it be happy and forever", "If it's easier for you (down the line, whenever you feel ready to deal with things), it's also totally valid to use the above comment as a rough outline for a letter. Talking to family can often be extremely emotionally fraught, and the likelihood is very high that you'll be pushed off track by your parents' innate desire to defend themselves.\n\nGiving both you and them the barrier of a letter is sometimes a really great idea, because it allows both you and them to process your thoughts and emotions without an audience.\n\nDoes not work in every family, some people really just need to actually talk about things. But since you do have a gift for expressing yourself in text (as evident through your original post), might be worth thinking about.\n\nFor the future, not trying to push you before you're ready, just... Be happy and healthy and live your best life! Congratulations on the nuptials!", "I say focus on your new life and forget about toxic parents (from experience.)", "As someone who had a not totally evil yet still abusive and manipulative mother and a dormat father I recommend letters. It's easier to think through what you want to say and easier to not fall into being a people pleaser that bows to pressure. It's also impossible for someone to interrupt and change the conversation in a letter. A letter can be ignored, but usually not for long.\n\nHanding over a physical copy might come across as more serious; but when I've been on the receiving end of a letter from my mom it has looked batshit crazy. It's possible this was because she was mentally ill & untreated, and to a point, somewhat batshit crazy.", "Same to you!", "Yes still stupid but also less people and less time. The dad is still an asshole, I\u2019m just saying a fever now a days isn\u2019t an unreasonable reason to stay back from something.", "But again he never once said she was sick with COVID or had any concerns about her having it which leads me to believe he either knew it wasn\u2019t serious or he was just lying his ass off.  He was an absentee father her entire life and believe me it sucks when you realize that the man who is supposed to be your father never really cared about you.", "Lol that's false as fuck, I have had more than 2 beers and never had problems because I have never been drunk, so you did something wrong or you are asian, and you don't have an enzyme, but I doubt the second because you would have said it already.", "If he doesn't care about her then why should she accept his apology? Why does he care about her husband's opinion? At best, his actions are contradictory.", "So, he shouldn't mind being blocked", "Aww is someone off their bipolar meds?", "don't get ahead of yourself, AITA has a character limit on posts :P", "Just because someone can do something alone doesn't mean company isn't welcome.", "Oh I agree, guys a fever aint nothig to sneeze at", "Oh I\u2019m not saying dad isn\u2019t an asshole, or that OP shouldn\u2019t be hurt. I\u2019m just trying to be specific about what part of what he did was genuinely wrong. If whatever wife had might have been contagious, then him attending would have been wrong; even with OP\u2019s permission, that\u2019s taking a risk for *all* the guests, not just OP.\n\nIn my experience, when dealing with toxic and selfish people it\u2019s crucial to know exactly what part of their actions you\u2019re really mad about. Otherwise, sooner or later they or a mutual acquaintance will find the opportunity to point out that the part you\u2019re saying you\u2019re mad about was actually justifiable, and it shakes your confidence in holding your ground. In this case, if there was a chance that wife was contagious then dad was right not to attend, but the *reason he made that choice* could still be wrong. Calling him out for his reasons/priorities will be more impactful than suggesting he should have attended, unless the fever had a known, non-transmittable cause.", "I don\u2019t think he cares as much as she wants him too. Lmfao. That\u2019s her sensitive ass fault.", "I doubt he\u2019ll care much.", "Ok I get you now.  I fully understand where you are coming from using this logic.", "Then why is he throwing a tantrum?", "Then why did he go crying to OPs Mom about how she humiliated him in front of OPs husband.  He even told OPs husband that he \"needs to control his wife\"  what kind of misogynistic crap is that?  He thinks that women especially daughters are beneath him and we should just be jumping for joy the moment he sees them."]}
