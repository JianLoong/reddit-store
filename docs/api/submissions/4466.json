What does it mean that she doesn\u2019t want to touch her children in that way as if to suggest there\u2019s something sexual or wrong with just dancing. Sounds like she has some issues.

What was Callie trying to accomplish", "NTA\n\n>She says it was an intentional snub and needs to be addressed\n\nThe entitlement is strong in this one; my sympathies to you.  This is an issue (if even that) between you and your mom, so that's up to you to manage, not her.", "NTA. Callie needs to stay in her own lane. Your relationship with your mother is *yours* and not something Callie gets to control because she\u2019s your wife now. You warned her in advance that she was on her own if she chose to pursue this fight with your mom. Hopefully Callie learned a lesson about minding her own business.", "NTA. Your wife is choosing to pick a fight about this, & choosing not to understand the difference between a specific mother/son dance & just dancing in general. There are many, much worse things an unhappy MIL can do to deliberately screw up a wedding, & from the looks of this, your mother didn't & wasn't trying to screw up your wedding at all - she just didn't want to dance that one particular dance, with you, & you were okay with it. Also - important! - your wife said she was okay with it at the time, too. So to turn around & get pissy about it because your mother did dance with someone else later on is ultimately just childish. \n\n\nYou told your wife up front that you weren't going to back her up if she decided to pick a fight with your mother over this, & I think you were right to do so. She got into it with your mother anyway, which she shouldn't have done if she wasn't capable of handling whatever your mother chose to reply with. Your mom could probably have chosen a nicer word than idiot, but why should she have to when she's basically being attacked weeks after your wedding for not dancing the mother/son dance, but dancing other songs, which she was told was okay at the time? You're not an asshole for letting Callie understand that just her being your wife doesn't magically make every action she does or thought that crosses her mind the correct one & you'll defend them to the death.", "NTA. Sounds like your mom had an overload of anxiety about having to be in the spotlight with all eyes on her and you dancing center stage. I've never cared much for these sorts of traditions, as it feels like a kind of forced intimacy in front of a whole audience. Your mom was super uncomfortable, you understood, and that should have just been the end of it. \n\nI'm not sure what your wife hoped to solve by hashing this out with your mom, other than to stir everything up. I mean, it's in the past now, so what did she expect your mom to do about it?", "Normally I think husbands should always refund their wives but you are NTA here.

You do not \"need to back her even when you don't agree with her\". That is a very immature attitude. Enabling and support are not the same. It seems Callie can't tell the difference between injustice and a bruised ego. NTA.", "NTA let me get this straight\u2026 \n\nSo your wife is mad that your mom had anxiety over the SPOTLIGHT being on just her and her son for the mother/son dance. You were kind and understanding to your mom and your wife is pissed because YOU didn\u2019t get to dance with YOUR mom. She\u2019s the AH, not you. \n\nThere is a distinct difference between dancing in a crowd with people around you dancing too and doing a solo dance in front of a crowd of people, many I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t know. Your wife is being very insensitive, selfish and quite frankly bratty. She picked a fight with your mom over something you clearly don\u2019t care about. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even something I cared about.\u201d As you only were doing it \u201cfor tradition\u2019s sake\u201d not for any sentimental, life changing, importance. How ever will you recover from missing this dance? /s \n\nDid she do her Father/Daughter dance? My guess is yes, so she needs to stop instigating nonsense when you clearly couldn\u2019t care less either way. This was YOUR dance not hers.. \nBuckle up for a fun life of pettiness and pot stirring, she sounds fun.", "ESH. Telling your mom to not call Callie an idiot is NOT agreeing with her or backing her up, it's standing up for the woman you married. You could have told your mother that while you didn't care about not dancing, that treating your wife that way is unacceptable.", "NTA.  Your wife is as toxic as your mother.", "Is it possible that your wife was pissed for you ? Because your mother's explanation is just BS.", "NTA you communicated beforehand and it was her choice to bring it up regardless. \n\nAlso the back me up even if you don't agree seems like a pretty big red flag to me. I think you need a good and honest conversation with your wife about this.", "As someone who takes things to heart, I somehow understand your wife but she didn\u2019t have to talk to your mom about it, because for some reason it feel like your mother either loves playing the victim or shearing just a great attention \u2026 person. \n\nHOWEVER you should have told your mother off for calling her an idiot. What type of response is that? It\u2019s clear she did that on purpose (getting even more attention, since all the attention was on you and Callie) and got mad for being call out for it. \n\nI feel like the major AH is your mother for being such an attention seeker and calling Callie an idiot for expressing herself. (It depends indeed how Callie talked to the mother, but since you didn\u2019t mention Callie being out of line, I\u2019m going to assume she wasn\u2019t out of line). The second AH is you simply for not telling you mom to STFU with the name calling. She\u2019s not a child, she\u2019s a grown ass woman who need to be able to have a conversation on a topic. You don\u2019t just get to call someone an idiot just because you feel called out ;) \nI\u2019m in between with Callie.

My mom pulled drama crap at my wedding too and it\u2019s just sad to see adults behave that way.\n\nYou\u2019re the AH for not stepping in when your mom called your wife and idiot.\n\nBut the biggest AH is your wife. There\u2019s a difference between being assertive and what she\u2019s doing which isn\u2019t \u201cempowered woman\u201d it\u2019s that she\u2019s trying to assert dominance.", "I go with ESH. But you less than your wife. She should have let it go. But you can\u2019t say that you won\u2019t back her up, not knowing how the conversation will go. If your mother insults your wife with harsh profanities, there comes the point you have to intervene.", "ESH\n\nYour mother for having some weird rule about \"touching her son '*like that*'\" at something I have literally seen at every wedding, and waiting until she was wound up tighter than a drum the day of before saying something.\n\nYour wife for picking a fight. When you become a big girl, you learn to control that urge to \"talk out every feeling you have\" when you know upfront it's going to cause a completely unnecessary fight.\n\nYou for being an ostrich.\n\nSounds like you married someone not too far from what you grew up with.", "So you\u2019ve married a woman who likes to pick fights with your mother? That sounds like it\u2019s going to go great for you. /s ESH", "ESH your mom for.being rude and it does seem she used this as a snub.  You for not saying your mom your decision to your wife.  And your wife because she is making a mountain of a mole hill. \n\nYou all seem pretty AHish.  Maybe therapy and distance yourself from your mom since she is toxic as you claim.", "This seems like ESH but it's not fully clear. Callie had no reason to pick the fight; the mom clearly has issues; and you generally need to have your wife's back or at a minimum do a better job of discussing the matter with her so that you understand what her deeper concerns are. In this case you're probably less TA but still not great.\n\nI think ultimately, though, we don't have enough information to really understand the dynamics here. We need to know what the bigger patterns in these relationships are: you say your mom is \"difficult,\" but like how? It seems like it was pretty over the top for her to be about to come to pieces because she couldn't just tell you that she didn't want to dance with you. Does she have a habit of coming up with reasons that big events need to be about her in some way? Like are we looking at a narcissist here?\n\nCallie picked this fight, and clearly has beef with your mom. You've indicated that they've had problems before--how bad has it been? What have previous fights been about? You said Callie wants to talk things through all the time, which normally is a good thing!, but maybe that is just completely contrary to your mom's whole vibe?\n\nIn general, dude, I think you sound like you're in a position where your wife and your mother are going to fight. You need to figure out how you're going to manage this because it's not going away. Maybe you address this directly with the two of them and try to work it out? Maybe you end up needing to cut one of them out (which could possibly mean the marriage failing). But look man, this sounds like a systemic issue that you need to get a handle on somehow because it's not going to go away.", "Esh bordering on YTA. Mom is an attention seeker. All attention to her before the wedding for the dance, having a breakdown so all had to run to her...mother/son dance was news? Every wedding (almost) has a mother/son dance. She could have brought it up at any time so it could be handled and addressed. Instead she waits until right before wedding. Groom could have danced with someone else, for example. And then, after hating to be touched and all that, is going wild on the dance floor with son's drunk boss? Talk about center of attention. So I call BS on mom and my guess is OPs wife is upset, not just about this instance, but about all the other times mom has made her needs the center of attention. So, OP step up. And what you think is stupid, may not be stupid to your wife cause situations and behavior cumulate.", "ESH. Callie should prob let it go but letting her call her names, is different then just not supporting her on the argument. There is a difference. It sounds to me like this has built and built and now the wedding pushed it over the edge for Callie. Are you *sure* you stand up for her as much as you think you do? Maybe just check in with Callie and see if it was really just about this one instance or if it\u2019s added up?", "I wish you would have insisted more in explaining to your wife that: \n\n1. You were the one who had the conversation with your mom, and your judgement is that it wasn't a snub but genuine discomfort. \n\n2. No one gets to decide who touches someone else in which way - your mom has free reign over her bodily autonomy and can choose which people she is comfortable being physically close to, even on her son's wedding day. \n\n3. You were not upset about not doing the dance, it worked out great for you. She will not get to be offended for you.\n\n4. This is not her fight, this is between you and your mother and any issue has already been resolved without your wife's involvement.\n\n5. Her pressing this issue is not only confronting your mother, she's also disrespecting you in your decision about -your- dance.\n\n6. This is not about her and the cancelled dance does not involve her or \"snub\" her in any way. This is a display of affection between mom and son, and if this is not how you are comfortable expressing affection with each other then that is your personal choice and not something your wife should be so judgemental over.\n\nYou went neutral instead of taking a stand, and therefore allowed a conflict to happen -in your name-. Hands off is not the best approach when people are trying to fight your battles against your will.\n\nESH, except your mom. You for not speaking your mind and standing up for your own decision about the dance, Callie for desperately searching for things to be upset about and butting in and creating issues where there are none.\n\nOh, and Callie gets a gold star in AH for this:\n\n>she said I failed in that situation and I need to back her even if I don't agree with her.\n\nSo if you two are having an argument, do you have to back her opinion against your own, or is it just when she's speaking with someone else that you have to pretend to agree with her? So when do you get to have your own opinions? That's just insane, and not how marriage works. Defend each other from viciousness - yes! But you are still two different people who can have different opinions out in the world. And she doesn't get to pick a fight and then have you fight it for her, FFS... She can fight her how battles and let you fight yours, and you can help each other when it's actually needed (not to secure a petty victory, but to protect each other against harm).", "INFO: Why are you not weirded out that your mom thinks dancing with you is sexual?", "NTA.\n\nYou've drawn a line in the sand regarding your mum, good on you. Your wife needs to learn to do the same.", "You went from N T A to ESH once the name calling started. Your wife should have left it alone right at the start. She wants to address it anyway that\u2019s on her, she\u2019s the AH, you\u2019re not really because you already asked her to drop it. Your mom called your wife an idiot, she\u2019s an AH. You just sat there while your mom called your wife an idiot, you\u2019re an AH. You can disagree with your wife and still stand up for her once that line is crossed.", "YTA - There's a difference between backing someone up and defending them from abuse. You could have allowed them to talk but still corrected your mother in a way that didn't escalate things. Just a \"hey hey... Be civil\" would have been fine and still kept you out of it. Name calling is petty and childish, and she shouldn't be doing it regardless of who is right or wrong.", "NTA. There is a difference between having someone's back and fighting their fights for them. In this situation I think it would have been patronizing for you to step into Callie's fight, she needs to be able to hold her own.", "NTA. Good on her for trying to defend you, but like you said, you were okay with it. If anyone should have been slighted, it should have been you, but you didn't seem to think it was a big deal. The spring should not rise higher than its source. Looks like Callie just wanted to have a reason to stir up drama.", "NTA.  The dance was you and your mom,  it had nothing to do with Callie.  You told her to stay out of it and she didn't so she got what she deserved.", "NTA, why, why would you talk this one out.  It reminds me of an old saying when you fight it out with stupid stupid will bring you down to its own level and win every time.  I\u2019m not calling anyone here stupid but obviously your mom has one thought process which I find weird and your wife is hyper sensitive to find closure on every process.  Why have a convo on this one let it go and move on.  Maybe this is the difference of the genders because I would have rather enjoyed getting a beer and staring into space, some call this burying my feelings but I find it delightful.\n\nSo in summary your wife wanted to talk out a situation that happened between you and your mom and your mom has some really weird logic.  You said nope not getting involved because I told you this wasn\u2019t a door worth opening and feelings would get hurt.  I agree with you, this is weird drama\u2026.\n\nI guess you could have tried playing mediator but that seems like a no win for you.", "ESH. You should have stood up for your wife. If you agreed with her or disagreed with her was irrelevant. If someone is insulting your wife, you stand up for her and say that\u2019s not ok. \nCallie should have followed your lead. If you wanted to handle it a certain way, and it was an issue involving you, she should have let you handle your family the way you see fit. \nYour mom should not have insulted your wife. Whether she likes it or not, your wife is family now and the person you chose to be with, name calling was unnecessary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
