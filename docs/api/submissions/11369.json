Next door was initially empty when I moved in due to some work that was going on but about 6 weeks ago a couple moved in with their baby. I say hi in passing to them and exchanged a few pleasantries with them but for the most part it\u2019s a polite neighbour relationship, we aren\u2019t friends. \n\n I live alone and am a quiet neighbour, however next door aren\u2019t. I hear everything! I don\u2019t know what the owners did when they were renovating but there is no sound insulation at all, I don\u2019t hear conversations at a normal level but that\u2019s it. It\u2019s terrace housing and I accept you will hear some things but it\u2019s crazy how much I can hear. I don\u2019t hear anything from my neighbour on the other side of me aside from the front door when I\u2019m in my front room. \n\nOnto the issue. The baby, because it\u2019s a baby cries a lot, but it\u2019s nearly constantly crying and sometimes scream crying nearly all day. And I mean all day! I put up with this most of the time and wear headphones a-lot, aside from that I work 2 days a week from home (which they know as I have taken in packages for them) and my job requires me to be on the phone nearly all the time, in zoom meetings etc. I work in the back bedroom upstairs as it\u2019s the only room I don\u2019t get any road noise in, which by the sounds of it is also the baby\u2019s room on the other side of the wall. It cries so loudly I can hear it like it\u2019s in the room with me, and clients and colleagues can hear it crying though my headphones and I\u2019m getting lots of comments from people about it. It\u2019s also very distracting for me to try and work with. \n\nYesterday after work I knocked on the door to explain what was happening and asked if it was at all possible that if the baby can\u2019t be calmed down to move them to a different room for a bit, because of the noise etc. I was very polite about it and apologetic. Well the mother exploded at me, swore at me, called me entitled and selfish and that I had no idea what it was like to be a mother and how hard it was, and she said she left the baby upstairs so she could go down and have a break from it\u2019s crying. Then slammed the door in my face. \n\nI feel really conflicted on this, because I know babies cry, I know they are difficult to settle and I imagine with all they crying they are really tired. But I make little to no noise as their neighbour and it\u2019s affecting my concentration work, and people are commenting on it and not in a good way! Was I TA for asking?\n\nEdit: I only work 2 days a week because I am also at university, so I don\u2019t have an office to go into the rest of the time. The job is strictly work from home. I also can\u2019t do the job anywhere else because I work in a section of banking, I have to have a wired connection to the internet at all times, no WiFi. And the conversations that I have are sensitive and private so they can\u2019t be done elsewhere like Starbucks or a library like some recommended. \n\nI am not complaining about the baby crying in general. As I said in the post I know they cry! I\u2019m not complaining about being woken up early on weekends, in the evening when trying to cook or relax, or being disturbed whilst studying, which I am. This is specifically about the 2 days I am working from home.

The fact that the mother exploded at you was also understandable, particularly as they may have heard your request as \u201cyour baby cries too much in your house. Fix it\u201d. Which is the sort of thing that can sound like a judgement of her parenting and a threat. \n\nYour position is reasonable, because you\u2019ve made requests, not threats or demands.

Then someone comes lver and complains about something she already did everything about and can't change a little bit. She is highly frustrated and probably hadn't have a decent sleep in weeks.

We can hear the neighbours switches being turned on and off.\n\nVictorian terraces have solid walls and no sound insulation at all, you should know this as you live in one.

YTA.", "Imagine the reverse, if she had asked you to work more from the office as you're waking the baby, would she have been an asshole? Yes. Say what you want, if it bothers you that much, make a noise complaint or, work from the office more, or deal with road noise and move your home office.\n\nAs someone who has noisy neighbours(dogs rather than babys) your best avenue is a noise complaint.\n\nUnfortunately YTA for trying to micro manage noise in someone else's house during sociable hours.", "YTA  did you think she's never considered getting her baby to cry less? And that your suggestion is helping her?", "YTA a child crying is communicating in the only way it knows.\n\nYou asking a mom to stop using parts of her house to accommodate you is ridiculous. Infancy is a super short period of a person's life, it's incredibly difficult to be a new parent.\n\nYou have multiple options here.\n\nSoundproof your own home.\n\nGet noise cancelling headphones for work.\n\nPlay some ambient noise in your office to drown out the baby.\n\nWork in another room like you're suggesting this woman does.\n\nI get it's frustrating, I'm a mother of four and I'm autistic so babies crying actually hurts me to listen to, it makes me cringe in my soul.\n\nThat said it's life and unless the baby is being neglected to the point where it's scream crying and the mother isn't looking after it you need to keep your nose out.", "NAH. This is an unfortunate situation. It wasn't wrong to ask but I also understand the mom freaking out. When you live on that little sleep and there's constantly someone screaming in your ear and you're so exhausted you want to just stop existing it's a slap in the face to get that kind of request, no matter how kindly it's worded. Straw that breaks the camel's back. \n\nWhen caregivers get overwhelmed it's recommended they leave the baby in a safe place and take a few minutes to collect themselves in another room or outside. Otherwise they may become dangerous to their own children. So this may be necessary for her to do sometimes. When you have a baby that doesn't sleep well you start to understand how sleep deprivation is used as torture. It gets extremely difficult to regulate yourself and your neighbor may well try to be more mindful after she's had some sleep even if you don't hear again from her.\n\nIt's sounds like the baby may be very young and colicky (which usually peaks around 6 weeks) or have some health issues, maybe a food allergy. There's a good chance this will resolve over the next few months but your best bet is to work from somewhere else for a while.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere simply is no feasable olution here except YOU soundprofing YOUR side.", "NAH. You asked, and you got your answer.", "NTA, but you can't tell someone to not use their nursery when they are home with their baby. That was never going to go over well. You can sue the owner of the unit so that they can insulate the unit for noise, which is a lengthy process but would be worth it. But, if this couple pays rent then they have the right to use the baby's room for the baby 24/7. I suggest you get very expensive noise-canceling headphones with a noise-canceling microphone. My brother bought some for about \u00a3300, and we have long calls while he is in a busy Starbucks. I can't hear a thing. Good luck.", "It\u2019s a tough situation. You have a right to peace and quiet in your own home, and if it was a dog barking you would probably have the right to try and get the situation fixed. But it\u2019s a baby, so the only thing you could do beyond picking an isolated office and wearing headphones was politely ask. \n\nTry not to take it personally. She\u2019s probably exhausted as a mom of an infant. I\u2019d go do your work at a local library if possible.\n\nNTA.", "YTA\n\nThe baby screaming all day probably means it has colic, which means it cries uncontrollably for literally no reason and there\u2019s nothing anyone can do about it. \n\nSo bearing in mind there\u2019s nothing she can do to make her baby feel better, it\u2019s highly likely she\u2019s absolutely exhausted and is probably going mad herself from the constant crying; do you really think the noise level for you is or should be a priority? No.\n\nShe knows the baby is making noise and that it\u2019s not pleasant for anyone around and she probably already feels horrible about it and the fact that there\u2019s literally nothing she can do to stop it.\n\nI\u2019m not saying going off on you was right of her, but I can certainly understand why she snapped, if I were in her position I probably would have handled it even worse than she did.\n\nI suggest you get yourself some noise cancelling headphones if you don\u2019t already have some and then go into your zoom settings and change the sensitivity on the mic so that it\u2019s not picking up the cries.", "NAH\n\nYou asked & got your answer. You would be an ah if you continue to push this conversation. \n\nNot sure what reaction you expected. If it\u2019s that disruptive for you & you should be able to guess it\u2019s x10000 worse for the Mom who is not able to comfort or calm her baby.

Human babies cry.\n\nYour lack of compassion and self centred thoughts are making you unhappy and the people in your sphere of life unhappy also.\n\nYou will be a much happier person if you work to develop a generosity of spirit and focus less on yourself.", "YTA. Fellow Brit working from home. Unfortunately neighbours make noise. I\u2019ve got a family with two twin boys age 5 that scream a lot  and play football in their garden which I can hear, the football constantly hits the fence and they argue with each other. However I do not care, because they are kids having fun. Last year in the summer a neighbour had builders in for 3 weeks so I had constant noise, didn\u2019t phase me though because stuff happens\n\nAlso babies cry, it\u2019s the way of life. You mentioned moving to get away from road noise? I\u2019m sure clients would prefer road noise, so YOU move rooms. Have you tried noise cancelling headphones? If it annoys you so much. \n\nI Imagine that you have a hybrid scheme , how about you ask your boss if you can go to the office full time? \n\nThere is multiple solutions you can try.", "NTA\n\nIf you are bothered by the noise, you are well within your right to say something. It looks like these people just moved in while already having a baby, so they have to know how disruptive their baby can be if all it does is cry. Especially if they leave it upstairs by itself to get away. How do they think everyone else must feel then.", "NTA, it's your job being jeopardized here. You sucked it up for a while - nothing changed, you talked to them politely, proposing a solution (moving rooms) - they cussed you. It's time to search the noise ordinance in your city and in your complex and file a complaint to the landlord.\nShe left her kid upstairs to cry while she went downstairs to chiil instead of trying to calm them down? She is AITA all right", "I don\u2019t know I think NTA and am surprised by all the contrary responses. Of course babies are going to cry and there\u2019s nothing she can do about that. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to try to find an accommodation that works for both of you and moving the baby to another room during the day is just that. You approached her politely and I don\u2019t really think you are in the wrong here.", "YTA. Do you think that they haven't been trying to calm the baby? Do you think they love to hear their baby crying all the time? However loud and annoying it is  for you, it's louder and probably more annoying for them.\n\nI appreciate it is annoying but babies cry. Maybe try and put some acoustic insulation on your wall.", "YTA\nBabies cry and those parents are already trying everything they possible can to make it stop. Leave them alone or offer to help.", "NTA you have a right to ask at least and it sounds like you did so in a polite manner, I imagine the mother\u2019s reaction was due to stress. If they\u2019re new parents they may still be learning, so it might take them some time to crack the code of how to get a baby to settle down. You may just have to wait it out or maybe try putting some insulation on your side of the wall that you share with them in the room that you work in? I\u2019m not sure if it would work, but those foam pads you see in recording studios?", "NAH\n\nHowever a  very slight asshole not for asking to be quiet but for your analogy that babies and your next-door neighbour are the same. Do you also drink formula milk and wear diapers?", "YTA. I understand babies crying can be annoying, but I\u2019m sure mum has ears and is also dealing with the brunt of the cries and doing what she can. Some babies simply cry for no reason and nothing can calm them. You moved into a home with a shared wall.", "Yta \n\nGuess what babies do, that's right eat sleep and CRY. Do you think the child's mother like the crying, NO. Does she like being made to feel like a bad mum because her baby cried, NO. Do you think she appreciates some ignorant childless human trying to tell her how to be a mother, FORK NO! \n\nYes you definitely deserved the serve you got from her. I've had multiple children and 1 out of 4 was colic and reflux which means that baby CRIED ALL THE TIME no matter what I did and the only place she would not cry is my arms. It's hard to do anything when you can't put the baby down, and no baby wearing didn't work.\n\nIf I were you I'd go back over there full of apologies for being and AH and say to her that after much reflection you are incredibly sorry you are.", "YTA", "NTA, but you are going to the wrong person. You need to get the landlord there and show how things the walls are cause if you can hear one neighbor but not the other that might be because they changed something in the walling on the apartment on her side.", "YTA - if they were playing loud music or something, that would be different. But the noise from a new baby isn't something they can control. \n\nAlso, it's bad enough that people have to tiptoe around their own house when someone's WFH, but expecting your neighbours to do that too? No chance! YTA", "NTA\n\nIf the baby is really crying all day, I think there could be a serious problem... it's not healthy for a kid to cry so much. \n\nAlso, she should try and change rooms so the baby doesn't disturb you the whole day. \nYou're also entitled to have a bir of peace at tour home, baby neighbors or not.", "YTA 100% the asshole. Babies cry, that\u2019s what they do. Lmao, how about you be a good neighbor and offer some help instead of criticism geez", "You're NTA for asking if something can be done and trying to find a balance. Asking a mom whose kid cries all the time and has her stressed out is a FAFO moment. You're lucky to be alive :)", "NTA. Babies cry, a lot. They can't help it and there's not very much the parents can do about it. However, it isn't an asshole thing to do to politely ask if there's anything they could do to help mitigate the effect it's having on you, if possible. The thing that makes you NTA here is that you understand babies cry and you're not expecting miracles, just possibly what reasonable adjustments they might make, which you're trying to discuss.\n\nIn that pretty specific context I don't think you're acting like an asshole.", "YTA", "NTA. While you should understand kids are prone to crying and there's probably also the mom could do about the noise you did just ask and try your luck. But if it's constantly constantly crying.. someone should check that out...", "If she wants to be an asshole to you simply asking if it was possible to change rooms than play her at her own game, as soon as its quiet blast screaming baby noises over your stereo and go out for a few hours.

You had the audacity to go ask a new neighbor that you don't know, aside from pleasantries, to take their baby to another room because you're having a hard time hearing. \n\nThe funny part is that you seem confused as to why she swore at you and slammed the door in your face. \"Why in gods name would she do such a thing??\" \n\nIf it's too loud for you to work from home, then how about working from your office the entire week? Problem solved", "NAH. I feel like this is a tale as old as time in sharing space. It just is what it is and sucks on both sides. I lived in an apartment where a mother and three small children (under 3 years old) lived above me. It was so loud all the time and she was doing her best but it was still personally extremely irritating. I definitely felt myself lose patience here and there but, at the end of the day, aside from moving, there was really nothing to be done. I do feel for you and I completely understand the frustration, but such is life sometimes. I did find some empathy that I was a single person without the responsibilities she had and reminded myself however annoying the noise was it was much harder for the mother which helped me keep perspective.", "Info - she left the baby?", "YTA buy some sound proofing.", "I'm going with NAH, but I think you're fighting a losing battle if you think asking a mother whose entire life in that moment is a screaming inconsolable baby, to somehow make the baby stop crying, however, I think moving the baby to another room is reasonable if possible.  My nephew would go days where he just screamed all day.  He had colic, & it was an absolute nightmare.\n\nYou need to be able to work, and the noise from next door is disrupting that for you, as well as everyone else on the call.  I would suggest trying to do your work in another area or do something to try to muffle the sound, but I don't think it should be on you to soundproof either (not sure you would even be allowed to make alterations like that on rented property).  It sounds like the real problem comes from crappy construction, which is incredibly unfair for both you and your neighbor.\n\nI have kids & have always tried to be mindful of noise, especially in a situation where we're in an apartment or duplex.  I also would communicate with my neighbors & ask about noise volume.  If I had been your neighbor, I would've probably made the effort to move the baby to another part of the house.", "YTA\n\nYou probably don\u2019t hear the other neighbor because they\u2019re quiet. \n\nThis is just what it\u2019s like to live in apartment/shared housing. \n____\nCan she \u201cfix\u201d her crying baby? No. \n\nCan you \u201cfix\u201d the noise level? Yes. \n\nAdd sound proofing to your office wall on their side to dampen the noise if it\u2019s that interfering for you.", "YTA.\n\nAlso high chance that the baby is colicky. Aka in damn near constant pain due to gas build up and all that fun stuff that comes with colic. It would explain the constant crying inability to be soothed etc.\n\nThe baby doesn't know how to do anything BUT cry in this case. The poor thing can't get the gas released easily and feels the pain, and the mum is doing her very best to ease it.\n\nAlso good on the mum for stepping away when the crying gets to her. I know it prolly hurts her entire being to step away from her crying child and leaving them in a room to cry alone for a few moments but she knows she needs that moment away to collect herself. she already feels shitty for not being able to help and soothe her child. She doesn't need you on her case as well.\n\nColicky babies will cry constantly and theirs not much you can do to soothe them some days. You live in a place with thin walls. So you gotta suck it up and deal or do something about it yourself aka soundproof your own room or move rooms. Don't ask her to move when she's doing everything she can to help her child.\n\nUnfortunately at this moment baby might be colicky and you'll have to deal for the time being. So I'd apologize and maybe have a friendly conversation with the neighbor instead of going in like you did.", "NTA. You did the right thing by approaching her first. Next step is lodging complaints with the leasing office.", "NTA. It\u2019s possible to be sympathetic to the situation and still ask the parents if there is anything they can do to keep the crying baby away from the part of the house where you are working. And that\u2019s what you did. I understand that the parents are frustrated but that isn\u2019t a reason to be an AH to a neighbor who is asking to try to work something out. Yes, babies cry, but adults are supposed to try to minimize the harm they cause to strangers who have not decided to have a baby and just want to live their lives in peace. \n\nPersonally, I would not be willing to take any packages for them now on your work from home days.", "YTA.\nWhat do you actually think she can do about the crying? Some babies cry a LOT no matter what you do.\n\nGet our own soundproofing insulation if it's impacting you so much.", "YTA. I live in a terrace too, my neighbour has a baby. It's up to you to insulate your side and dampen the noise. Babys are going to baby, you are being unreasonable and you don't get to tell them what they do and who they put where in their own house. Put shelves up, or a bookcase, on the adjoining room for example. That'll sort a lot of it.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the parents would also prefer if their baby wasn\u2019t crying. \nYou live in a terraced house, you have to accept that you will hear loud noises from your neighbours!!", "YTA and bring \u201cpolite\u201d about it.

The sound situation sounds like it\u2019s nobodies fault; just an unfortunate function of the design of those houses.
