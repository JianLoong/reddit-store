{"id": 11369, "submission_id": "11gy66i", "title": "AITA for asking my neighbour to keep her baby quiet or move rooms?", "selftext": "So I 28f live in a terrace house, which is pretty typical here in the UK. Next door was initially empty when I moved in due to some work that was going on but about 6 weeks ago a couple moved in with their baby. I say hi in passing to them and exchanged a few pleasantries with them but for the most part it\u2019s a polite neighbour relationship, we aren\u2019t friends. \n\n I live alone and am a quiet neighbour, however next door aren\u2019t. I hear everything! I don\u2019t know what the owners did when they were renovating but there is no sound insulation at all, I don\u2019t hear conversations at a normal level but that\u2019s it. It\u2019s terrace housing and I accept you will hear some things but it\u2019s crazy how much I can hear. I don\u2019t hear anything from my neighbour on the other side of me aside from the front door when I\u2019m in my front room. \n\nOnto the issue. The baby, because it\u2019s a baby cries a lot, but it\u2019s nearly constantly crying and sometimes scream crying nearly all day. And I mean all day! I put up with this most of the time and wear headphones a-lot, aside from that I work 2 days a week from home (which they know as I have taken in packages for them) and my job requires me to be on the phone nearly all the time, in zoom meetings etc. I work in the back bedroom upstairs as it\u2019s the only room I don\u2019t get any road noise in, which by the sounds of it is also the baby\u2019s room on the other side of the wall. It cries so loudly I can hear it like it\u2019s in the room with me, and clients and colleagues can hear it crying though my headphones and I\u2019m getting lots of comments from people about it. It\u2019s also very distracting for me to try and work with. \n\nYesterday after work I knocked on the door to explain what was happening and asked if it was at all possible that if the baby can\u2019t be calmed down to move them to a different room for a bit, because of the noise etc. I was very polite about it and apologetic. Well the mother exploded at me, swore at me, called me entitled and selfish and that I had no idea what it was like to be a mother and how hard it was, and she said she left the baby upstairs so she could go down and have a break from it\u2019s crying. Then slammed the door in my face. \n\nI feel really conflicted on this, because I know babies cry, I know they are difficult to settle and I imagine with all they crying they are really tired. But I make little to no noise as their neighbour and it\u2019s affecting my concentration work, and people are commenting on it and not in a good way! Was I TA for asking?\n\nEdit: I only work 2 days a week because I am also at university, so I don\u2019t have an office to go into the rest of the time. The job is strictly work from home. I also can\u2019t do the job anywhere else because I work in a section of banking, I have to have a wired connection to the internet at all times, no WiFi. And the conversations that I have are sensitive and private so they can\u2019t be done elsewhere like Starbucks or a library like some recommended. \n\nI am not complaining about the baby crying in general. As I said in the post I know they cry! I\u2019m not complaining about being woken up early on weekends, in the evening when trying to cook or relax, or being disturbed whilst studying, which I am. This is specifically about the 2 days I am working from home. Looks like I\u2019m investing in an expensive pair of noise cancelling headphones with a push to talk button.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nAs it keeps coming up - I own they rent. These are terrace houses not and apartment complex. No I can\u2019t afford to buy a detached house, a girl can dream!\n\nThe dad came round this evening, he apologised for his fianc\u00e9 yelling and swearing at me, apparently she is struggling with PPD and it\u2019s a difficult time for her.  As a lot of others suggested the baby has colic. Long story short I explained to him I wasn\u2019t asking them to stop the baby crying, just if there was anything that could be done on the days I was wfh etc. \n\nHe said it couldn\u2019t be that bad, I offered for him to come in and hear what it was like, the baby was upstairs crying again and we were downstairs and it was still very loud. He was surprised it was that loud, they genuinely didn\u2019t realise the sound was coming through like that. He apologised for the noise, but both agreed nothing could be done about the crying. He said he would talk to his fianc\u00e9 about having the baby in a different room when I\u2019m wfh but didn\u2019t know if anything would come from it. \n\nTurns out we are both fans of Rise Against so at least we have some common ground now. As good an outcome as I could hope for I suppose.", "created_utc": 1677842303, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gy66i/aita_for_asking_my_neighbour_to_keep_her_baby/", "score": 1516, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that the mother exploded at you was also understandable, particularly as they may have heard your request as \u201cyour baby cries too much in your house. Fix it\u201d. Which is the sort of thing that can sound like a judgement of her parenting and a threat. \n\nYour position is reasonable, because you\u2019ve made requests, not threats or demands.

Then someone comes lver and complains about something she already did everything about and can't change a little bit. She is highly frustrated and probably hadn't have a decent sleep in weeks. So please, don't get annoyed. She tries her best. Find solutions for yourself. She is already at her limit.", "NAH. All you did was politely ask, nothing asshole-ish about that.", "NTA but the mother is for being rude", "We live in a terrace in the UK. We can hear the neighbours switches being turned on and off.\n\nVictorian terraces have solid walls and no sound insulation at all, you should know this as you live in one. You\u2019re probably not as quiet as you think you are and asking for a *baby* to be quiet is bordering on lunacy. YTA.", "[deleted]", "YTA  did you think she's never considered getting her baby to cry less? And that your suggestion is helping her?", "YTA a child crying is communicating in the only way it knows.\n\nYou asking a mom to stop using parts of her house to accommodate you is ridiculous. Infancy is a super short period of a person's life, it's incredibly difficult to be a new parent.\n\nYou have multiple options here.\n\nSoundproof your own home.\n\nGet noise cancelling headphones for work.\n\nPlay some ambient noise in your office to drown out the baby.\n\nWork in another room like you're suggesting this woman does.\n\nI get it's frustrating, I'm a mother of four and I'm autistic so babies crying actually hurts me to listen to, it makes me cringe in my soul.\n\nThat said it's life and unless the baby is being neglected to the point where it's scream crying and the mother isn't looking after it you need to keep your nose out.", "NAH. This is an unfortunate situation. It wasn't wrong to ask but I also understand the mom freaking out. When you live on that little sleep and there's constantly someone screaming in your ear and you're so exhausted you want to just stop existing it's a slap in the face to get that kind of request, no matter how kindly it's worded. Straw that breaks the camel's back. \n\nWhen caregivers get overwhelmed it's recommended they leave the baby in a safe place and take a few minutes to collect themselves in another room or outside. Otherwise they may become dangerous to their own children. So this may be necessary for her to do sometimes. When you have a baby that doesn't sleep well you start to understand how sleep deprivation is used as torture. It gets extremely difficult to regulate yourself and your neighbor may well try to be more mindful after she's had some sleep even if you don't hear again from her.\n\nIt's sounds like the baby may be very young and colicky (which usually peaks around 6 weeks) or have some health issues, maybe a food allergy. There's a good chance this will resolve over the next few months but your best bet is to work from somewhere else for a while.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere simply is no feasable olution here except YOU soundprofing YOUR side.", "NAH. You asked, and you got your answer.", "NTA, but you can't tell someone to not use their nursery when they are home with their baby. That was never going to go over well. You can sue the owner of the unit so that they can insulate the unit for noise, which is a lengthy process but would be worth it. But, if this couple pays rent then they have the right to use the baby's room for the baby 24/7. I suggest you get very expensive noise-canceling headphones with a noise-canceling microphone. My brother bought some for about \u00a3300, and we have long calls while he is in a busy Starbucks. I can't hear a thing. Good luck.", "It\u2019s a tough situation. You have a right to peace and quiet in your own home, and if it was a dog barking you would probably have the right to try and get the situation fixed. But it\u2019s a baby, so the only thing you could do beyond picking an isolated office and wearing headphones was politely ask. \n\nTry not to take it personally. She\u2019s probably exhausted as a mom of an infant. I\u2019d go do your work at a local library if possible.\n\nNTA.", "YTA\n\nThe baby screaming all day probably means it has colic, which means it cries uncontrollably for literally no reason and there\u2019s nothing anyone can do about it. \n\nSo bearing in mind there\u2019s nothing she can do to make her baby feel better, it\u2019s highly likely she\u2019s absolutely exhausted and is probably going mad herself from the constant crying; do you really think the noise level for you is or should be a priority? No.\n\nShe knows the baby is making noise and that it\u2019s not pleasant for anyone around and she probably already feels horrible about it and the fact that there\u2019s literally nothing she can do to stop it.\n\nI\u2019m not saying going off on you was right of her, but I can certainly understand why she snapped, if I were in her position I probably would have handled it even worse than she did.\n\nI suggest you get yourself some noise cancelling headphones if you don\u2019t already have some and then go into your zoom settings and change the sensitivity on the mic so that it\u2019s not picking up the cries.", "NAH\n\nYou asked & got your answer.

If it\u2019s that disruptive for you & you should be able to guess it\u2019s x10000 worse for the Mom who is not able to comfort or calm her baby.

Human babies cry.\n\nYour lack of compassion and self centred thoughts are making you unhappy and the people in your sphere of life unhappy also.\n\nYou will be a much happier person if you work to develop a generosity of spirit and focus less on yourself.", "YTA. Fellow Brit working from home. Unfortunately neighbours make noise. I\u2019ve got a family with two twin boys age 5 that scream a lot  and play football in their garden which I can hear, the football constantly hits the fence and they argue with each other. However I do not care, because they are kids having fun. Last year in the summer a neighbour had builders in for 3 weeks so I had constant noise, didn\u2019t phase me though because stuff happens\n\nAlso babies cry, it\u2019s the way of life. You mentioned moving to get away from road noise? I\u2019m sure clients would prefer road noise, so YOU move rooms. Have you tried noise cancelling headphones? If it annoys you so much. \n\nI Imagine that you have a hybrid scheme , how about you ask your boss if you can go to the office full time? \n\nThere is multiple solutions you can try.", "NTA\n\nIf you are bothered by the noise, you are well within your right to say something. I don't think you phrased it in a way that was rude or unreasonable.\n\nIt looks like these people just moved in while already having a baby, so they have to know how disruptive their baby can be if all it does is cry. Especially if they leave it upstairs alone to get away. How do they think everyone else must feel then.\n\nI'll chalk up the screaming and swearing at you to stress, but it was definitely an overreaction. If you talk to her again and she acts that way, I would just go to the building manager instead.", "NTA, it's your job being jeopardized here. You sucked it up for a while - nothing changed, you talked to them politely, proposing a solution (moving rooms) - they cussed you. It's time to search the noise ordinance in your city and in your complex and file a complaint to the landlord.\nShe left her kid upstairs to cry while she went downstairs to chiil instead of trying to calm them down? She is AITA all right", "I don\u2019t know I think NTA and am surprised by all the contrary responses. Of course babies are going to cry and there\u2019s nothing she can do about that. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to try to find an accommodation that works for both of you and moving the baby to another room during the day is just that. You approached her politely and I don\u2019t really think you are in the wrong here.", "YTA. Do you think that they haven't been trying to calm the baby? Do you think they love to hear their baby crying all the time? However loud and annoying it is  for you, it's louder and probably more annoying for them.\n\nI appreciate it is annoying but babies cry. Maybe try and put some acoustic insulation on your wall.", "YTA\nBabies cry and those parents are already trying everything they possible can to make it stop. Leave them alone or offer to help.", "NTA you have a right to ask at least and it sounds like you did so in a polite manner, I imagine the mother\u2019s reaction was due to stress. If they\u2019re new parents they may still be learning, so it might take them some time to crack the code of how to get a baby to settle down. You may just have to wait it out or maybe try putting some insulation on your side of the wall that you share with them in the room that you work in? I\u2019m not sure if it would work, but those foam pads you see in recording studios?", "NAH\n\nHowever a  very slight asshole not for asking to be quiet but for your analogy that babies and your next-door neighbour are the same. Do you also drink formula milk and wear diapers?", "YTA. I understand babies crying can be annoying, but I\u2019m sure mum has ears and is also dealing with the brunt of the cries and doing what she can. Some babies simply cry for no reason and nothing can calm them. You moved into a home with a shared wall.", "Yta \n\nGuess what babies do, that's right eat sleep and CRY. Do you think the child's mother like the crying, NO. Does she like being made to feel like a bad mum because her baby cried, NO. Do you think she appreciates some ignorant childless human trying to tell her how to be a mother, FORK NO! \n\nYes you definitely deserved the serve you got from her. I've had multiple children and 1 out of 4 was colic and reflux which means that baby CRIED ALL THE TIME no matter what I did and the only place she would not cry is my arms. It's hard to do anything when you can't put the baby down, and no baby wearing didn't work.\n\nIf I were you I'd go back over there full of apologies for being and AH and say to her that after much reflection you are incredibly sorry you are.", "YTA", "NTA, but you are going to the wrong person.

But the noise from a new baby isn't something they can control. \n\nAlso, it's bad enough that people have to tiptoe around their own house when someone's WFH, but expecting your neighbours to do that too? No chance! YTA", "NTA\n\nIf the baby is really crying all day, I think there could be a serious problem... it's not healthy for a kid to cry so much. \n\nAlso, she should try and change rooms so the baby doesn't disturb you the whole day. \nYou're also entitled to have a bir of peace at tour home, baby neighbors or not.", "YTA 100% the asshole.

Problem solved", "NAH. I feel like this is a tale as old as time in sharing space. It just is what it is and sucks on both sides. I lived in an apartment where a mother and three small children (under 3 years old) lived above me. It was so loud all the time and she was doing her best but it was still personally extremely irritating. I definitely felt myself lose patience here and there but, at the end of the day, aside from moving, there was really nothing to be done. I do feel for you and I completely understand the frustration, but such is life sometimes. I did find some empathy that I was a single person without the responsibilities she had and reminded myself however annoying the noise was it was much harder for the mother which helped me keep perspective.", "Info - she left the baby?", "YTA buy some sound proofing.", "I'm going with NAH, but I think you're fighting a losing battle if you think asking a mother whose entire life in that moment is a screaming inconsolable baby, to somehow make the baby stop crying, however, I think moving the baby to another room is reasonable if possible.  My nephew would go days where he just screamed all day.  He had colic, & it was an absolute nightmare.\n\nYou need to be able to work, and the noise from next door is disrupting that for you, as well as everyone else on the call.  I would suggest trying to do your work in another area or do something to try to muffle the sound, but I don't think it should be on you to soundproof either (not sure you would even be allowed to make alterations like that on rented property).  It sounds like the real problem comes from crappy construction, which is incredibly unfair for both you and your neighbor.\n\nI have kids & have always tried to be mindful of noise, especially in a situation where we're in an apartment or duplex.  I also would communicate with my neighbors & ask about noise volume.  If I had been your neighbor, I would've probably made the effort to move the baby to another part of the house.", "YTA\n\nYou probably don\u2019t hear the other neighbor because they\u2019re quiet. \n\nThis is just what it\u2019s like to live in apartment/shared housing. \n____\nCan she \u201cfix\u201d her crying baby? No. \n\nCan you \u201cfix\u201d the noise level? Yes. \n\nAdd sound proofing to your office wall on their side to dampen the noise if it\u2019s that interfering for you.", "YTA.\n\nAlso high chance that the baby is colicky. Aka in damn near constant pain due to gas build up and all that fun stuff that comes with colic. It would explain the constant crying inability to be soothed etc.\n\nThe baby doesn't know how to do anything BUT cry in this case. The poor thing can't get the gas released easily and feels the pain, and the mum is doing her very best to ease it.\n\nAlso good on the mum for stepping away when the crying gets to her. I know it prolly hurts her entire being to step away from her crying child and leaving them in a room to cry alone for a few moments but she knows she needs that moment away to collect herself. she already feels shitty for not being able to help and soothe her child. She doesn't need you on her case as well.\n\nColicky babies will cry constantly and theirs not much you can do to soothe them some days. You live in a place with thin walls. So you gotta suck it up and deal or do something about it yourself aka soundproof your own room or move rooms. Don't ask her to move when she's doing everything she can to help her child.\n\nUnfortunately at this moment baby might be colicky and you'll have to deal for the time being. So I'd apologize and maybe have a friendly conversation with the neighbor instead of going in like you did.", "NTA. You did the right thing by approaching her first. Next step is lodging complaints with the leasing office.", "NTA. It\u2019s possible to be sympathetic to the situation and still ask the parents if there is anything they can do to keep the crying baby away from the part of the house where you are working. And that\u2019s what you did. I understand that the parents are frustrated but that isn\u2019t a reason to be an AH to a neighbor who is asking to try to work something out.

Next door was initially empty when I moved in due to some work that was going on but about 6 weeks ago a couple moved in with their baby. I say hi in passing to them and exchanged a few pleasantries with them but for the most part it\u2019s a polite neighbour relationship, we aren\u2019t friends. \n\n I live alone and am a quiet neighbour, however next door aren\u2019t.

It\u2019s terrace housing and I accept you will hear some things but it\u2019s crazy how much I can hear. I don\u2019t hear anything from my neighbour on the other side of me aside from the front door when I\u2019m in my front room. \n\nOnto the issue. The baby, because it\u2019s a baby cries a lot, but it\u2019s nearly constantly crying and sometimes scream crying nearly all day. And I mean all day! I put up with this most of the time and wear headphones a-lot, aside from that I work 2 days a week from home (which they know as I have taken in packages for them) and my job requires me to be on the phone nearly all the time, in zoom meetings etc. I work in the back bedroom upstairs as it\u2019s the only room I don\u2019t get any road noise in, which by the sounds of it is also the baby\u2019s room on the other side of the wall. It cries so loudly I can hear it like it\u2019s in the room with me, and clients and colleagues can hear it crying though my headphones and I\u2019m getting lots of comments from people about it. It\u2019s also very distracting for me to try and work with. \n\nYesterday after work I knocked on the door to explain what was happening and asked if it was at all possible that if the baby can\u2019t be calmed down to move them to a different room for a bit, because of the noise etc. I was very polite about it and apologetic. Well the mother exploded at me, swore at me, called me entitled and selfish and that I had no idea what it was like to be a mother and how hard it was, and she said she left the baby upstairs so she could go down and have a break from it\u2019s crying. Then slammed the door in my face. \n\nI feel really conflicted on this, because I know babies cry, I know they are difficult to settle and I imagine with all they crying they are really tired. But I make little to no noise as their neighbour and it\u2019s affecting my concentration work, and people are commenting on it and not in a good way!

In both cases however, we have a source of disruption for whom the care taker is solely responsible, whom is affecting the lives of third parties; why is it that one gets a pass and one doesn't?

Can you put up temporary things to muffle the sound on your end - wall carpet hangings, special sound absorbers, white noise machine (the latter may be picked up on calls, but may be preferable to the baby)? Even an extra wall with insulation in between to absorb most of the crying (this can be temporary as well)? When I moved into my flat, it was right above the underground parking to the building, and I could hear the garage door and louder noises in the garage all the time, so I became rather obsessed with sound proofing.  Eventually, it did help to get some carpeting in, as well as some temporary objects that would absorb the majority of the sound on the floor itself, so that it didn\u2019t travel further up.

This is kind of what you can expect when you live in places like this.", "NAH.

No matter how politely you ask, the request is ridiculous and comes across as patronising/judgemental/both.  \nAnd no, asking to move rooms is not more reasonable. Logistically, terraced housing often has alternating mirrored or rotated layouts from one house to the next. I'm in terraced housing and I know my neighbours do not have the exact same layout as I do. Moving to a room without an adjacent wall to your home might simply not be possible. Or it may be that the other rooms aren't safe for baby or even that the neighbours on the other side would take issue.  \n  \nUltimately, residential properties are for residential purposes and if you are unable to have an appropriate environment for working from home then the onus is on you to make it appropriate.  \n  \n I work from home, also in a confidential finance-related job.

I had a second child and she didn't have it and while I was sleep deprived with her it was nothing like I experienced with my son.

The mother could just as easily \u201cleave the baby\u201d downstairs when you\u2019re working to get a break and be a considerate neighbor. I get that she\u2019s stressed but her reaction was illogical imo. Also the fact that the baby is screaming to the point where the mother is leaving the baby alone for hours is concerning. Usually babies don\u2019t cry for nothing, the little one may have an allergy. My godson used to scream cry and I said it sounded like a pain cry, and it turns out he was having a reaction to lactose and when the breastfeeding mother stopped eating milk, he stopped screaming in pain all of the time.", "This is when you put a speaker right next to the downstairs wall and blast metal music whenever the baby is crying.

That being said, people are saying that the mother is TA are INSANE. Just completely out of touch with reality.\n\nDo you know why the mother is taking a break from the crying baby? She is on her absolute last nerve. Those nerves are raw and she needs a moment to decompress. OP going over and asking her to essentially make it so OP won\u2019t be bothered by the baby was never going to go over well. It\u2019s like whacking a bees nest then wondering why the bees stung you. The mother is human, not some saintly deity. \n\nThere are few things more stressful to a parent than an inconsolable child. I say this as someone who has 3 kids and the first one cried A LOT. Some times we knew why he was crying. Other times at a total loss. Not only is it stressful but it\u2019s exhausting. \n\nI think OP getting the headphones is a good idea. Another idea (probably too late now) is maybe striking up some friendly, empathetic small talk about the baby crying when crossing paths. Can ask if the baby is doing ok and get the mom talking. It maybe could have helped the mom via venting. You could have tactfully dropped some subtle hints about hearing the baby while working and maybe the mom could have become more aware of how it\u2019s affecting you.

They may not be able to stop the crying, but the can mitigate the inconvenience that it causes.\n\nYou can argue that babies are a part of society, but the last time I checked, my living room is not a place where I am expected to interact with society. The same thing goes for the OP. Their needs are not lessened because the baby exists. They did not choose to have the baby, and they lived there long before the baby did. The OP should not have to deal with a baby squalling 24/7. I'm sure that the neighbours would raise holy hell if the OP dared to play music beside the baby's room, because it might disturb their nap and inconvenience them. The same thing applies here. The OP has a right to live in their own home without the baby sounding like it's beside them, which is 100% an inconvenience.", "It's certainly not the fault of OP, so it's the parents' fault.\n\nThey seem to think it's just fine that their desire to keep cum as a pet outweighs their neighbors' right to live peacefully.", "Nobody is saying that. If I have a 5 year old who breaks something, yes it\u2019s my fault. If I have an infant who breaks something, I should have probably been keeping a closer eye on my kid, so again, it\u2019s my fault. If my child has colic and is crying, there is only so much I can do to attempt to stop that crying. My 5 month old is currently teething. When his teeth are hurting we try pain killers, home remedies, herbal remedies, putting teethers and pacifiers in the fridge, music, rocking him, cuddles. But sometimes that isn\u2019t enough and he\u2019s going to cry. In that situation I\u2019m already doing everything physically possible to stop him crying, if he is still crying, it is NOT my fault. It\u2019s not his either. But it\u2019s not mine.", "My aunt brought me a car seat to the hospital when I had my daughter.  I drove my aunt home, went to Target, and then drive myself and my newborn home after.   Three days later, I took her to a family get-together, and let me tell you Grandma is not quiet.  LOL.   I exposed her to the loud family early, and never had a problem with her crashing when she was tired, no matter where we were.  \n\nI'd say that was good advice.", "OP doesn't want the kid to never cry, and only asked that the baby be in a different room for 2 days of the week.  The mother hates being with the kid so much that she puts the kid upstairs to get away from it.  She's not doing everything possible to keep the kid from ruining her neighbors life.  Maybe it would make a difference if the kid were just kept a little bit from shared wall.  The mother isn't interested in trying anything.", "Screaming babies often fall asleep from exhaustion.", "I think you\u2019re being a little presumptive that the mother isn\u2019t trying anything. Terraced houses are notorious for this. It sounds (from OPs description of the house) like it\u2019s a 2 bed terrace. I live in a 2 bed terrace. It isn\u2019t really possible to move the baby somewhere that the OP won\u2019t hear them because almost every room shares a wall with the neighbours and the houses are generally pretty narrow (my FILs terrace is literally 4.5 metres wide), so even if the room doesn\u2019t share a wall with the neighbours, it\u2019s still going to be heard. I had neighbours with a kid (1-3 year old during the time they lived next door) who would scream every morning (sometimes over night too), and there was pretty much nothing that could be done. I recognised that I live in a terrace and that\u2019s the sort of thing that happens in a terrace. I\u2019m at my FILs right now, and next doors baby just cried. We heard it, there\u2019s nothing they or we can do about that short of soundproofing our side of the house. If the baby has colic, it isn\u2019t going to stop crying and there\u2019s incredibly little the parents can do."]}
