The idea that OP and his husband simply existing or - GASP! - wanting to participate in society like everyone else, is somehow \"uncomfortable\" for someone else is absolute horse shit. It genuinely enrages me.

Why are we letting adults off the hook for being homophobic? Make them say why. Put them on the spot. Let them know it is absolutely a reaction to this specific situation, because it is. Why are we coddling?\n\nNo no, the question isn\u2019t \u201cwhat are we allowed to be at going forward\u201d, that\u2019s just letting everyone pick and choose when to exclude them and they have to cower to it. Either you accept people or you don\u2019t, if nephew and new wife don\u2019t, then they can skip the holiday, They only get to control their own actions, not the actions of others.", "/u/FondantOutrageous118 is a bot that copied this comment, changing words around to try to avoid detection: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ve7o9/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_nephews_wedding/jrco192/", "/u/ImpressiveEngineer98 is a bot that copied this comment: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ve7o9/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_nephews_wedding/jrceby4/", "[removed]", "I quite enjoy when petty meets honesty lol", "Neither would I travel nor would I send a present.
