Im disgusted by touching another humans body fluids he knows this I only share drinks with him when they are alcoholic otherwise I don\u2019t share. \n\n2. It\u2019s not kinky I would wake up to a yellowish stain in the sink and obviously know what it is and open the tap and clean it off. It\u2019s not sexual I just clean it off \n\n3. He said it was better for him to do it in the sink as him sleepy makes noise I just never knew that he does this onto the floor in the guest bathroom too which is nasty\n\n4.

I live in Africa, so obviously I\u2019m always on high alert given our social and economic status. When I was pregnant we had moved into a new place however the guard would let anyone in making me constantly alert and scared.

This is nasty behavior to the nth degree.

And same goes for training his dogs.\n\nI have a strong feeling this only scratches the surface of the issues in your marriage.", "NTA, girl he nasty. And it's not 'weird' that he uses yours, it's completely disrespectful.", "NTA, that's one of the grossest things I've heard on this sub.", "NTA. It's easy to pee in a toilet without making noise if you are male: you just aim at the rim on one side of the middle of the bowl. It'll swirl around and into the water more or less silently.", "NTA, that is just disgusting and infantile. Wth is wrong with him??!!", "NTA that's disgusting, he needs to quit the habit already, one it's not sanitary, two it's just gross", "NTA. I can understand peeing in the shower, but the *sink*? That's nasty.", "He's never heard of sitting down to piss?

Also, why was he ever peeing in the sink to begin with if you have a guest bathroom. Peeing in the toilet being too loud in the main bathroom I can understand but why not shut the door or go to a bathroom further away like the guest bathroom. I was assuming you didn't have one.\n\nThis is so strange it feels fake.", "NTA. Your husband sounds insane.

Some men are just stupidly loud pee-ers, while others aim not directly into the middle of the water, making it slightly more silent. Sadly I know a thing or two about this because of neighbors and exes. I wish I didn't though. \n\nNTA, if you wake from him peeing you wake from it. That's not really something you can control, and it doesn't make you ta if you want to sleep.

Either way, he's getting something out of having you clean up his urine.  Which is, yea, revolting. Maybe it's more of a mommy issue.  Maybe he just wants to feel taken care of.

You started this fiasco.   And your husband seems to now enjoy it.   Ok if he was going to pee anywhere, why not in the shower versus the sink?\nThis is a disgusting habit, (and I am one not usually grossed out by things), and needs to stop NOW!  First of all, let\u2019s get to the fact that he is not even cleaning up his own mess.  Why not?   Two, if there is that much mess that you must clean up, can you just imagine everywhere else bud urine has splattered that you are not seeing and that is not being cleaned up?!   You say this is not sexual.  It may not be. But it is clearly a fetish of some kind because he is using your sink and not his. There is no reason why he cannot use the toilet.

NAH.\n\nObviously, the piss on the floor is a hurdle too far and he should be cleaning this up himself. But pissing in sinks really isn't that big of a deal. Sinks are already all sorts of wild, most people spit in them while brushing their teeth. While the whole \"pee is sterile\" thing is a misconception, an average, healthy person still has much grosser things going on in their mouth than what comes out of them when they pee. So if your daughter playing in a sink that's been peed in is your issue, I also suggest you find another way to brush your teeth that doesn't involve the sink.\n\nI can't blame you for being upset about stains. But this issue is kind of all over the place between you drinking that was brought up for some reason and a dog and \"the help.\" While he should be cleaning up after himself, peeing in the sink really isn't that big of a deal.
