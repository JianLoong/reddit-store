No response.\n\n9pm comes around, I text \"hows the game?\" No response.\n\n10pm I text \"you still planning on coming?\" No response.

You need a better boyfriend.", "Girl, I say this with love: break up with him. That is not an ok response. You were more than clear and were very generous to even stay an extra hour. There is no world in which he should respond to your generosity by yelling at you. Even if he hadn\u2019t yelled, his lack of response via text is incredibly rude when he knew what time you would be there. You deserve better.", "NTA. You made your timeline crystal clear, and communicated. He did not respect that, and he clearly didn't prioritize messages from you. He needs to grow up, and be more respectful of you and your priorities - especially when he wants a favor from you (free use of your gym).", "NTA- you communicated very clearly with him and he chose to ignore that communication. He needed to be adult enough to leave the game session to be present while you were at the gym to sign him in or he needed to acknowledge that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to make it in your time frame and pass on it for the night. He\u2019s almost 30 and acting like a spoiled toddler throwing a tantrum when he doesn\u2019t get what he wants. He needs to grow up.", "NTA \n\nIt will only get worse from here.  Run.", "NTA.

Huh?", "NTA, it\u2019s cruel and stupid that he would yell at you when you did an excellent job of communicating. All he had to do was read/respond to any of your texts. He\u2019s the one who blew you off! \n\nHonestly he should be apologetic and just grateful you\u2019re not more annoyed that he kept you waiting.

This is on him and I\u2019m a little suspicious that he didn\u2019t see those messages. He may have considered the drive worth it if he thought you\u2019d be mad later and he wanted this \u00ab\u00a0inconsiderate\u00a0\u00bb moment to be in his back pocket as a counter balance to that potential anger.\n\nEdit: mad not bad", "You are so easy. \ud83e\udd23", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How did he not check his texts before going to see if you were still there? You told him 3 hours. 3 1/2 hours later he shows up and thinks you're at fault for leaving when you said you would? Ignore his tantrum and make it clear that from now on, to avoid issues, you need concrete plans with him or no gym.", "NTA\n\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t his fault, but he was at fault for not notifying you about anything. And then getting mad at you from not coming back.\n\nThe way that he was angry about that, I would be more cautious, because if things like that happens more than a few times it\u2019s a red flag.", "WTF. Why would you stay with this guy who makes you wait 3 hours to reply and then guilt trip you for not going back? If his gainz are so important, he would show up like a normal person. You can\u2019t help him decide if gaming is more important than gym and you\u2019re not expected to wait for hours for him to make up his mind.", "NTA my husband is a super nerd who can easily be consumed and even he reads his texts and responds.", "NTA. He is a Dick for treating you that way after you did what was reasonably possible to allow him entrance to the gym, including doing a whole extra hour of work. \n\nFrankly, it doesn\u2019t seem like a good relationship and he is immature.", "Nta.\n\nHe saw the messages you sent about having left, he didn\u2019t care about your routine or your schedule, the only thing he cared about was playing his video games and getting HIS gym time on on HIS time.", "NTA - Girl\u2026 he is almost 30 years old and is acting like this???? Please leave him.", "NTA. How can he not respond for 3 hours and expect no consequences?", "As a male who loves the gym and uses it for rehab after  a severe spinal injury..............u need to punt this bloke asap. There's zero excuse for yelling at your partner when you have done what you have. He seems like a control freak and a possessive grub tbh. I hope that doesn't upset you mate but really u need to get out while you can.", "NTA\nHe tried to get you out of bed at almost mudnight!?! After ignoring all of your update texts! He sounds like an inconsiderate selfish goober.", "> He got upset because the gym is a very big coping skill for him \n\nMeh, it wasn't that big a deal enough for him to arrive in decent time.\n\nHe's not missing out because of you. He's missing out because of him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA that man is almost 30, jfc", "NTA. Why didn't he answer to one of your messages? It would be quite easy to tell you when he is going to arrive...", "NTA - He\u2019s a jerk to think he\u2019s in the right here and not immediately comprehend how generous you have been to him. He\u2019s not boyfriend material. Not even friend material.", "Oh sweetheart, he has really got into your head hasn't he? NTA. He is selfish and too old for you. A grown man should be able to keep his promises and organise his time. You are being taken advantage of and he is getting you to doubt yourself. \n\nThe only arsehole here is him and it is definitely his fault his gaming session went on too long and he is not missing out on his gym because of you, but because he wanted to have his cake and eat it too, and expected you to be there to kowtow to his wishes. Look at this situation dispassionately, and see all the red flags.", ">  I was being selfish for not coming back to the gym for him. \n\nHe was selfish for standing you up, making demands and then starting an argument immediately before you were about to sleep. But sure, I bet he is an amazing boyfriend in other respects. /s\n\nNTA", "OP are you sure that your boyfriend was gaming? Let\u2019s look at the facts. He is uncontactable for 3 hours. He waits until he knows that you have left. Then he calls you to yell at you\u2026 making it clear that it\u2019s YOUR fault that the two of you did not catch up. Was he ever even at the gym?\n\nWhere were the texts from him during this time? The one that says, \u201cI am on my way\u201d or \u201cjust a few more minutes\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can make it\u201d?\n\nI have 3 theories: either he was doing something that he should not be doing\u2026 or he didn\u2019t want to go to the gym but he couldn\u2019t admit it\u2026 or he is looking for reasons to break up with you\u2026", "Yeah, not just lack of response, but he didn't even check the texts she sent him when he was done with his gaming? OR, even worse, he saw the texts, knew she'd waited 3 hours and went home, and thought it was reasonable for her to come back and sign him in. Then got mad she didn't want to do that?!? Really NTA.", "You deserve a better partner. One who respects you, because it doesn\u2019t sound like he does! Your Not The Ass for not signing him in\u2026 NTA", "Yikes, NTA. You had good communication and he didn\u2019t even care. Might want to think about whether this is what you want for your life? That\u2019s very selfish behavior", "His gaming sesh? Like Dungeons and Dragons or video games or some other totally unimportant crap he could easily blow off or reschedule if his \u201ccoping skill\u201d was really that important? \n\nSo he yells at you after ignoring your texts when he knew you would be telling him to hurry up. Bc he didn\u2019t want to hurry up. So he ignored you. Then he shows up acting clueless like he can\u2019t check a text message and see what\u2019s up. Then he yells at you. \n\nYea, sorry, he sounds like a huge loser. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He can workout in the parking lot.", "NTA\nSo what it sounds like is that your boyfriend actually doesn't care about you at all: Your time is not important to him,  you waited an extra hour for him,  communicated with him regularly and he still wanted you to wait around for him because what he was doing was more important than coming within the time frame you offered. And then he yelled. Time to get rid of this lump and move on.", "> its not his fault his gaming sesh went late\n\n**Yes it is**\n\nIt\u2019s also his fault he didn\u2019t text you back the entire time", "NTA. He was late because of a \"gaming session\" running late.  What a loser.", "I mean. It sort of is his fault his gaming session ran late. He's an adult who is presumably capable of stringing together the \"Sorry guys, I have other plans and have to leave at X time\" sentence. Unless he was duct taped to the chair, he had the opportunity to be considerate to you or his gaming friends, and he chose his friends.\n\nNTA", "The fact that the man is almost 30 and dating a 21 year old is a red flag. Also he has a childish mentality", "NTA First, you are young, this will get worse. You will wake up and be 30 and be like \u201cI should of listened to that thread\u201d. Second, you were clear and tried to contact him. Then you get verbally abused. Idk if you want to hear the comments but I hope you listen. Is he worth it?", "Lol you shouldn\u2019t have even stayed past 10. Especially since he didn\u2019t respond.", "NTA - if the gym is a major coping thing, then you\u2019d think he\u2019d prioritise that. He shouldn\u2019t be yelling at you for his mistakes either.", "NTA\n\nHe was fully selfish during that time to not communicate at all, and further to be unapologetic and demanding thereafter. \n\nHe's a bit of a loser to say he's missing out on gainz bc of one session. He prioritized gaming, that's on him. He made his own choice.", "Does he throw his toys out of the pram when he has his little tantrum?\n\nNTA. Bf needs to grow the f up.", "NTA. He's still being selfish. He's lucky you even waited until 1030 after no responses at all, let alone waiting until 11. \n\nI get it can be hard to respond during long multiplayer gaming sesh's but no response at all for hours while he was already aware you were waiting for him, so that's all on him", "This", "NTA and it really troubles me that you in any way could blame yourself for this. You clearly communicated when you were available, tried contacting him several times and were ignored, and then yelled at for doing exactly what you said you would. If this is in any way a pattern (and the fact that you're so quick to blame yourself makes me worry it is) you need to seriously reconsider this relationship. Your bf is a big boy. If he 'needs' the gym it was on him to make it a priority.", "Does he not work? Why did he want to go the gym so late? You gave him plenty of chances, it's not your fault that he prioritized gaming instead of going to the gym like he said he would. Waiting for 3 hours was already generous. NTA", "NTA He chose to be late and not respond to your texts. He therefore chose not go that night. Bro cannot accept the consequences of his choices, verbally abuses you, and has a tantrum. Breal up with him, he isnt mature enough for a relationship.", "NTA.  Clearly his gaming took priority which implies that the gym really isn't that important to him.  His irrational behaviour and lack of consideration are red flags.", "> I (21f) \u2026 My boyfriend (29m)\n\nHow long have you been together? Is there a pattern of him completely disrespecting you? Not a total shock he treats you like that with the age gap, women his age likely wouldn\u2019t put up with his shit.", "NTA he didn't miss out on his gainz because of you he missed out because he prioritized a gaming session over going to the gym with no regard to your time and he expected you to get out of bed and sign him in and i assume stay with him while he worked out because he couldn't be bothered to stop playing a game to workout in your timeframe but wanted you to accommodate his timeframe if he needs the gym so bad he needs to prioritize it otherwise its a him problem not a you problem and im glad you didn't cater to him on this", "NTA. Huge red flag", "NTA\n\nHe's a bad communicator, is hours late, and then tried to blame you for it. Instead of berating you over the telephone he should have walked in and bought a membership at the gym. All his inconveniences are totally self-inflicted.", "NTA. If his 'gainz' were so important he could have responded to your messages and acted like a decent person that respects that you were doing him a favour.", "Give yourself the respect he does not give you and move on. Man is throwing a tantrum at his big age of 8 yrs older than u. NTA", "NTA. I would of left too and you BF is definitely an AH.", "Def needs a better boyfriend. It is his fault his gaming session went over. He chose to continue gaming. Ugh. He\u2019s a crap bag."]}
