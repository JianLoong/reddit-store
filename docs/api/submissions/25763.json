Also srry on mobile. \n\nI (21f) have a gym membership to a very popular chain gym that lets me have guests whenever I want for free.

I go to the gym after I get out of my summer classes, around 8pm, and I'm usually there until around 10pm, depending on how crowded the gym is. My boyfriend told me he had a game sesh at 8pm but would join me afterwards. I made him well aware that I leave after around 2 hours and I could stick around for maybe 3 but I like to go to bed early and wake up early so I can't stay all night. He texted me that that was fine and he'd see me later.\n\nFast forward to 8pm, I text him I'm at the gym and he can just text me when he gets here and I'll sign him in. No response.\n\n9pm comes around, I text \"hows the game?\" No response.\n\n10pm I text \"you still planning on coming?\" No response. I had already finished my gym routine for the day and thought about leaving, but I did remember that I said I could stay 3 hours if needed, so I decided to do some extra cardio and wait for him.\n\nAt 11pm, I had already done my gym routine and ran an hour so I texted \"hope your night was good! sad I didn't see you at the gym, heading out now. hope to see you tomorrow!\" Again no response.\n\nUntil like a half hour later, my boyfriend calls me and says he's at the gym and he needs me to sign him in. I say I already left and was already getting ready for bed but we can try again tomorrow. He got upset because the gym is a very big coping skill for him and I was being selfish for not coming back to the gym for him.

You need a better boyfriend.", "Girl, I say this with love: break up with him. That is not an ok response. You were more than clear and were very generous to even stay an extra hour. There is no world in which he should respond to your generosity by yelling at you. Even if he hadn\u2019t yelled, his lack of response via text is incredibly rude when he knew what time you would be there. You deserve better.", "NTA. You made your timeline crystal clear, and communicated. He did not respect that, and he clearly didn't prioritize messages from you. He needs to grow up, and be more respectful of you and your priorities - especially when he wants a favor from you (free use of your gym).", "NTA- you communicated very clearly with him and he chose to ignore that communication. He needed to be adult enough to leave the game session to be present while you were at the gym to sign him in or he needed to acknowledge that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to make it in your time frame and pass on it for the night. He\u2019s almost 30 and acting like a spoiled toddler throwing a tantrum when he doesn\u2019t get what he wants. He needs to grow up.", "NTA \n\nIt will only get worse from here.  Run.", "NTA. You made your points clear about leaving after a set time. He should've responded to the texts if he was planning to meet you later.", "NTA. He is", "Nta", "Wrong! It is his fault. He knew the timeline in advance. He chose to ignore it = his fault. You texted him several times. He chose to ignore them = his fault. \n\nThe fact that he needs gym time as a coping skill is NOT your fault. \n\nGo to bed and sleep peacefully knowing that you are NTA!", "NTA. He could have replied to any of your texts but didn\u2019t. You\u2019re not a mind reader.", "NTA. Huh?", "NTA, it\u2019s cruel and stupid that he would yell at you when you did an excellent job of communicating. All he had to do was read/respond to any of your texts. He\u2019s the one who blew you off! \n\nHonestly he should be apologetic and just grateful you\u2019re not more annoyed that he kept you waiting. If this happened to me idk if I would answer someone\u2019s call if they ghosted me all night and I was already in bed. He seems like kind of a jerk.", "NTA", "NTA. He knew your times and if he knew his gaming was running over, it\u2019s highly suspicious that he didn\u2019t pick up his phone to let you know why he was running late as would have been normal and would have caused him to see the messages. This is on him and I\u2019m a little suspicious that he didn\u2019t see those messages. He may have considered the drive worth it if he thought you\u2019d be mad later and he wanted this \u00ab\u00a0inconsiderate\u00a0\u00bb moment to be in his back pocket as a counter balance to that potential anger.\n\nEdit: mad not bad", "You are so easy. \ud83e\udd23", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How did he not check his texts before going to see if you were still there? You told him 3 hours. 3 1/2 hours later he shows up and thinks you're at fault for leaving when you said you would? Ignore his tantrum and make it clear that from now on, to avoid issues, you need concrete plans with him or no gym.", "NTA\n\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t his fault, but he was at fault for not notifying you about anything. And then getting mad at you from not coming back.\n\nThe way that he was angry about that, I would be more cautious, because if things like that happens more than a few times it\u2019s a red flag.", "WTF. Why would you stay with this guy who makes you wait 3 hours to reply and then guilt trip you for not going back? If his gainz are so important, he would show up like a normal person.

Please leave him.", "NTA. How can he not respond for 3 hours and expect no consequences?", "As a male who loves the gym and uses it for rehab after  a severe spinal injury..............u need to punt this bloke asap. There's zero excuse for yelling at your partner when you have done what you have. He seems like a control freak and a possessive grub tbh. I hope that doesn't upset you mate but really u need to get out while you can.", "NTA\nHe tried to get you out of bed at almost mudnight!?! After ignoring all of your update texts! He sounds like an inconsiderate selfish goober.", "> He got upset because the gym is a very big coping skill for him \n\nMeh, it wasn't that big a deal enough for him to arrive in decent time.\n\nHe's not missing out because of you. He's missing out because of him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA"]}
