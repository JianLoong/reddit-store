Have some consideration for other people.", "Nope, I live alone and always have tp to hand in the main bath and guest wc. If it gets to one roll then I buy more.", "Everyone I know buys toilet paper before they run out. That's a pretty standard practice.", "Some people are introverts, and she might have feeled embarassed.\n\nBut instead of assuming good intent, people here prefer to think that she is nasty and wanted OP to see poop running down her legs... like it wasn't a horrible experience for her and she really wanted exactly that to happen.", "She made her point in a way that didn\u2019t destroy a rug.", "That, orrrr\u2026 she could have just said something.", "man you\u2019re weird and childish asf.", "i mean he also wasn\u2019t considerate enough to not put her in the embarrassing situation of having no toilet paper because i\u2019ve LITERALLY never done that to someone ever. so yeah i absolutely know the difference, but i also would never put someone in that situation. even if i had toilet paper at my house, i love my boyfriend, all of him. sometimes he gross. i still love him and i don\u2019t shame him for anything.", "Well, sure. But, also, if there\u2019s not toilet paper, what are you gonna do? Getting in the shower and hosing off seems like the next best thing.", "He said that was not the case.\n\nPersonally, I would never yell for help from the toilet.", "Well whiptidoo aren\u2019t you special. Shit happens. Shitting in the shower shouldn\u2019t.", "He had done it before. Words didn\u2019t work.", "I mean you\u2019re 100% right, but I still love it.", "It wasn't out of the blue, it was the second time.", "Yeah but she didn't know that \"you would have understood\". You are the kind of guy that calls his gf gross without trying to understand a situation. Something tells me she have some reasons to think you would not have understood.", "True & no, I would not continue to be in the shower. I was just commenting about kids & pets being poop factories.", "I do have a trash can, what\u2019s up with these assumptions? I\u2019m not the disgusting human you\u2019re all trying to make me out to be", "Kleenex can certainly be flushed. Napkins and paper towels, maybe not. They can go in the waste bin. \n\nIt\u2019s not a hardship for her to wait a minute or two while the boyfriend brings her some Kleenex or napkins.  You act like she\u2019s paying for a five star hotel.", ">Some people are introverts, and she might have feeled embarassed.\n\nThat's a her problem, if she's anxious to the point where she can't even explain why she's having a shower to her BF.... please. She's not a child.", "Ah yes; have my partner watch me clean my poopy asshole out instead of communicate with them. Totally not a weird thing to do.", "Per OP, this has happened to her at least once before. She said something then and it obviously didn\u2019t solve the problem. Bet this did\u2026", "I guess congrats but I'll be honest,  I'm a human being and there have been times I thought I had more TP and oops it was the last roll.  I've been to friends house where that happened. \n\nI wouldn't consider myself some horrible person who deserves shit on me lol.", "Oh 100%. And it\u2019s a real power move to make the perpetrator come and watch you do it. She\u2019s my hero.", "It\u2019s not special, friend. Just buy TP before you run out.", "I had gotten some pooey water on my feet and in the heat of the moment I called her gross, yes. She knows I don\u2019t think of her like that I hope", "You run out of toilet paper routinely.", "No, don\u2019t flush any of that. Toilet paper is made to degrade quickly in water. \n\nAnd yes, it is.", "Nonverbal communication is real.", "Unlike not keeping TP on hand which is totally normal. What the hell does he do when he poops?!", "But did you let other people use the toilet without letting them know that there was no toilet paper?", "It\u2019s happened twice in 1 year.. is bi-annually a routine occurrence?", "How is it a hardship?", "Yes, that\u2019s the definition of it.\n\nI never run out of toilet paper. I anticipate the need for it and purchase accordingly.", "On the chance that you're a fellow young person who knows that you can't live up to your parents' generation's definition of perfect housekeeping, but not knowing where the \"acceptable\" line is:\n\nYes, this is BAD, my dude. Not just because she's a female, but because TP is a very necessary household supply for all humans who poop out of their buttholes. It's the first item I brought into my apartment before beginning the move-in process, and it's something I check that I always have a sufficient supply of before I have a guest over. In ~3 years of providing for myself and my home's TP supply, I have managed to never forget to buy more/replace the roll (I might forget to switch it out, but I never let there be no available fresh rolls in the bathroom). It's not easy -- I struggle with ADHD and depression, I forget my own birthday if it's not on the calendar, and Lord knows how many times I go to a store and forget something I wanted -- but **toilet paper is**  ***just that important.***\n\nYou need to apologize to her for letting it run out, and for making her feel like she had to take extreme measures to get herself clean. You're VERY lucky she isn't just ditching you and telling her friends \"y'all, I'm breaking up with him, this is TWICE he did not have his basic necessities together\".\n\nAdulting is hard \ud83d\udc95 it's not easy to just intuitively guess at what societal expectations are necessary and which are optional. Some things, like a bowl full of fresh and delicious fruit on the table all the time? That's not necessary. Toilet paper? That one is *absolutely* necessary. Some things you can skip out on...TP just isn't one of them.", "I\u2019d almost rather die.", "You probably would\u2019ve elegantly dodged the poo in the shower too you perfect human being who has never not even once ran out of tp", "You lead a very privileged life lol."]}
