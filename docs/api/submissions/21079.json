That was your call. And you should not complicate your daughters' day with a step-niece. Or anyone. It's your daughter's party.\n\nAnd I would disinvite all the participants in this attempt to pull focus, because they might well try to take over during the party, and you'll have to stand there and let them or step in and stop them, creating havoc.\n\nNTA. But your mother needs to be taught a lesson on not interfering in matters that are not hers to control.", "NTA and your mum had no business agreeing to this.\n\nIt's unfortunate she had to be disappointed.

Are you expected to shout surprise twice? Are you expected to have both girls\u2019 names on the bday cake?  What about blowing out the candles on cake? Are the guests expected to bring both girls a present?  Ok, I confess these are all rhetorical questions used to point out how ridiculously entitled a request your sibling and sibling in law has asked for!  What kind of A-hole thinks this is ok?  Someone who has a problem with not getting all the attention. Especially on special occasions. I promise you that it wouldn\u2019t matter if you  threw yearly bday parties for your daughter, they\u2019d still be like this. Don\u2019t compromise on this. Surprise parties are special and they make the recipient feel special. The only person who might feel diminished, should you cave to these a-holes\u2019  requests, will be your daughter. If you want to be diplomatic, you can plan to give your niece the birthday gift you had planned to give her at her own cancelled bday party.   But that\u2019s it! And shame on your mom for basically encouraging adults to behave like a tantruming toddler who\u2019s been denied candy at the checkout counter.  Plus she also drank from the same self-entitlement cup by thinking she had the right to make any promises on yours and your daughters behalf.

I would call them and nip it in the bud asap. It\u2019s clear they called your mom because they knew she\u2019d agree. I bet if they had called you and explained, you may have if you wanted to minimally agreed to them bringing a small cake and her being sung to. However, there\u2019s no way of knowing what they expect by not speaking to you directly and the last thing you need is them to invite more people or expect you to do more especially as the host of the party.", "NTA.

Its her party, her bday.\n\nThe rest seems a shit show! \n\nIts a surprise party but your daughter requested a party, no surprise there then as its what she wanted.\n\nIts only her third every party, thats on you as you choose to travel and not throw her a party. It doesnt make it anymore special cause its only her third party, she could of had more but you choose not to have any.\n\nNieces party got post poned due to family drama, you didnt say emergency or a death so drama is lame as its a childs bday, they should grow up and get their shit together for a child.\n\nNext party couldnt happen due to weather, meaning hurricane, tornado it was impossible for ppl to attend?\n\nIt is utter crap as niece could have a party at any point even if delayed and how is you acknowledging her at your daughters party going to make her feel any better about not having her own party?\n\nIts a shitty ask but as a parent were not talking adult kids even teens but a young child and personally i would forget the family politics and think this poor child needs to be feel special and theve been let down.\n\nMy kids litrally wouldnt give a crap if i made a point of pointing out another childs bday at their party as long as i didnt let them open their gifts and blow their candles out! \n\nUnless your neice is some entitled shit or this was some power play on her parents side, cut the girl some slack and not see it as a demanding family, shes a child who just wanted a party and a celebration just like yours.", "YWBTA\n\n> just acknowledge her at my daughters birthday party.\n\nNot a massive request.\n\nYou are overreacting a little to the request. \nYour mother is an asshole for agreeing without consulting you.
