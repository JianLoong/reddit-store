I promise you that it wouldn\u2019t matter if you  threw yearly bday parties for your daughter, they\u2019d still be like this. Don\u2019t compromise on this. Surprise parties are special and they make the recipient feel special. The only person who might feel diminished, should you cave to these a-holes\u2019  requests, will be your daughter. If you want to be diplomatic, you can plan to give your niece the birthday gift you had planned to give her at her own cancelled bday party.   But that\u2019s it!
