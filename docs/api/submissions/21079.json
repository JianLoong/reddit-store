They know they are wrong or they would have come to you to begin with.", "Nta your mom can throw the step nieces a party if she want to. Also your stepnieces didn\u2019t even rsvp so I think they don\u2019t even wanna come", "If all they are asking for is that at some unobtrusive point during the party someone says \"and can everybody wish a happy birthday to x who's birthday was a few days ago\" then YTA. It'd still be a party focussed on your daughter, acknowledging things other than her birthday doesn't take away from that. The amount of people who seem to think it does isn't really surprising given how entitled a lot of people are.\n\nIf they want for her to be included as joint birthday girl or something along that line then definitely NTA. I am assuming that's the case, especially with the whole behind your back element.

They can schedule one two weeks out, or the month before, or whenever.  Good lord.", "NTA- they can\u2019t have it both ways. I could see doing it if they always acknowledged your daughter\u2019s birthday at their party but seeing they\u2019ve never done that there is no need for your daughter to share the spotlight", "NTA. First, it irks me when people get mad or hold something hostage to get their way. The whole point of asking is because you acknowledge that being told \u201cno\u201d is an option. Getting mad at someone for saying no defeats the point of asking in the first place. It turns a polite action into a rude one.\n\nSecond, this is your daughter\u2019s birthday and it is just as important that she feels important as your step-niece.

You can form it as a \u201cwhat if\u201d hypothetical scenario to see how she would think about it. Some kids have such open hearts, they just want to share. Others want or need to have sole custody of the spotlight. Let her decide how this is to be handled and give her no guidance on it. Let it be her decision one way or another. Then, explain to both your mom and your step-niece\u2019s parents and let them know how your daughter wants it handled. \n\nIf there is no way to discuss this with your daughter without exposing the surprise party, then simply make an executive decision and tell them it\u2019s not going to happen. Explain that it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s surprise party, and since she did not have many parties, that this is going to be your way.\n\nThe danger in establishing a precedent is that it will be repeated every year and expected. Eventually you will be hosting joint parties or completely solo parties that are held on the same day as a vengeance thing. You can choose your future. There is no win here.", "NTA - it's going to be the first birthday party she remembers. It should be hers and hers alone. I'm wondering why the family keeps delaying step-niece's party - they could just hold a small thing at their house!", "NTA your daughter deserves to have her own special day.

Your daughter's surprise party shouldn't overshadow your stepniece's birthday. Cake for everyone!", "No. You\u2019re NTA. My family always had a Cousins Party because we had so many cousins that were born in summer that it made sense to just throw one party for all of them instead of clearing every weekend of the summer for an individual party. But we also had our individual bday party with friends where it was just a slumber party or whatever on a weekend we chose. You have to discuss a joint party well beforehand and it\u2019s not your fault her party got rained out. They can just throw the party the weekend after. You planned a party with only your daughter in mind, so if I were the niece, I wouldn\u2019t even want to claim that party for myself. It\u2019s not about her! Please let your daughter have her own special day and maybe tell the niece she can open her present from you guys in a bedroom or something on the side so as not to take over the party.", "INFO: was there ever talk of potentially doing a joint party?

I'm a bit put off by the term step-niece, I have two step brothers, and we're not super close, but I call their kids my nieces and nephews. I really don't remember what exactly we did for my kids' 9th birthdays, but I doubt they would have been upset if they had shared a party with their cousins. \n\nIt sounds like there is some other history here that makes OP upset. It may be totally justified, but there's not enough info here.", "I have the same question. Everyone seems to be assuming that the relatives plan to totally hijack the birthday party, but that's not what \"acknowledge\" implies to me at all.

And I just kept dreading having to talk to my sil about this because this was my first baby, first time throwing anything for her and I didn't want to share it. My nephew is my sils 4th child. I truly believe I'm not a selfish person but I was willing to be selfish *for my daughter*.

My sils have always coordinated to have the parties on separate weekends and there's no acknowledging the other bday boy at his cousins party beyond a \"happy birthday buddy\" if the party falls on their actual birthdate.
