When camp is over and the nicee can also tell OP how much she enjoyed camp. \n\nThe delivery of the money is moot in this scenario.\n\nIf the niece thanked OP (electrionically or in person) when she was informed OP was paying for camp, no additional written thank you is required.\n\n\nOption 2: OP volunteered to pay for camp and the niece doesn't know, or the Mom asked OP to pay for the camp.\nGift = Money\nThanker = Mom\nThe thank you can be timed w/ one of the following  times that can be considered receiving the gift:\nA. When the mom is informed that OP is paying for camp,\nB. When the mom receives the money.\n\nIf the mom thanked OP (electronically or in person) when was informed OP was paying for camp (electronically or in person), no additional written thank you is required.\n\nIn either scenario, and acknowledgment of receipt is required only if there is a question of the mom receiving the money and is the mom's responsibility. \n\n\nSo, OP shouldn't be expecting a thank you from the niece in either scenario at this time and If I had to guess, I would guess OP has already been thanked by both the mother and the niece at least once each.

And now, sister is just saying it\u2019s not a big deal that the niece is ignoring her.\n\nI\u2019m not denying that this aunt seems to be giving very lavish gifts and going a little overboard. For me, i agree with yiu, it\u2019s too much. But I still have to say, if you *do* accept a gift, you say thank you. In a text, over the phone, whatever. I never had anyone spend crazy amounts of money on me like that, but if my aunt had paid for half of my school trip, I\u2019d have said thanks.", "You\u2019re not an asshole, but try not to let expectations of people eat away at you. You\u2019re only hurting yourself by letting this kind of thing take up realty in your head.\n\nYou\u2019ve learned a lesson that your generosity goes unappreciated. Move forward and show generosity where it\u2019s deserved.", "Maybe if you'd gifted them what they wanted vs what you think they wanted they'd reciprocated better. NTA", "YTA. No one writes letters and if you're only giving to get your dick sucked in gratitude you're in the wrong. Give or dont.", "I had to text my sister to see if she even got the gift for my niece (it was in a pile at a party). She said she\u2019d just been busy and decided not to do thank yous. Really bothered me because that\u2019s not how we were raised, and I don\u2019t want to waste my money on shit she doesn\u2019t need, want or like (but she also avoids if I ask what they want or need). Now I only hand give them things. I know you shouldn\u2019t give gifts expecting anything in return, even a thank you, but I also assume that if I don\u2019t even get a text that it didn\u2019t arrive or wasn\u2019t liked or needed.", "That's because it *is* confusing, and I agree with your take.  My mom gave up on making us write thank you notes in our teens (we were too hard to pin down) and our extended family kind of realized that it's just part of adolescence to be a little thoughtless.  Demanding thank-yous is weird and self-congratulatory.\n\nAs a teen I never would've imagined a pen could cost $300, goddamn.  OP is expecting a level of appreciativeness that is unrealistic.  And the \"gift\" for the class trip sounds more like she was helping her *sister* out, not the kid.  It's the sister who should be thanking her for that.  My parents also didn't share this kind of financial information with us (loans, etc).  \n\nBased on her post history, OP is an antivaxxer, which is probably the actual reason her niblings aren't eager to get in contact with her.", "The mum did thank her for the money for the trip. \n\nThey got in an argument over the makeup, because the 14yr old doesn't use makeup yet and mum wanted to take her to a department store for a makeover and buy her first makeup. \n\nTBH it sounds to me like OP sent inappropriate expensive gifts, (the makeup and pens) that she didn't get thanked for because no-one wanted them, and gave mum $1500 to help with a school trip, that mum thanked her for. It's not quite as straightforward as it sounds. Plus she's a conspiracist who thinks the Illuminati are running anything so, you know, maybe mums trying to keep her away from them. Lmao.", "Sure, but saying thank you isn't something reserved purely for favourite gifts. It's really the absolute most basic decency. The insinuation that the boys didn't send a thank you text because they didn't like the pen and it's therefore understandable is baffling. That's not how it works.", "I only wrote thank you notes for wedding gifts, and they were torturous to write. It felt so fake and I deeply resented being forced to write \"thank you for the money. I'll think of you when I spend it. It was so thoughtful of you to send money. I really appreciate having more of it.\" To each their own, but I will not send thank you cards. I thank people in person or send a quick text.", "It's a tough one. I do stuff for my family, but I'm also not on their radar like I wish I was... I'm just an adult. I can see that stuff escapes them.", "Let's make this an in person exchange. You give me a gift, it take it and turn around without a thank you. This isn't acceptable behavior.", "Wow. Did you see her post on \"kids not writing notes is the downfall of our society\"?", "Holy shit lol", "Whaaaaaat. Haha wow, I\u2019ve just had a look. No wonder her family aren\u2019t rushing to get in touch", "Sure, but at 14 and up, we can start expecting kids to be a bit responsible for their own sense of etiquette.", "why tf would you spend $80 on a baby tracksuit. don't they grow out of clothes in a matter of weeks/months anyway? maybe they just thought it was absurd to spend $80 on a tracksuit for a baby and didn't want to encourage the behavior", "Eh. Maybe. I was raised by a narcissist that wanted praise and OP is really giving off those vibes. The way the situation has been presented, it\u2019s walking a thin line for me. I feel pretty comfortable saying at least part of this is just OP seeking praise.", "So wouldn\u2019t that mean the societal expectations around gift giving/thank you notes have changes? If a lot of people feel a certain way\u2026", "100% your sister is not telling the kids where the gifts are coming from. Kids don\u2019t write thank you notes anymore, but there\u2019s no way they wouldn\u2019t even send a text.", "you\u2019re entitled to that opinion, and i understand many will agree. \ud83d\ude42\n\nMy opinion - this goes deeper than \u201cgift giving\u201d. shit parents are passing on shit values. It\u2019s rampant in society these days. Just because people behave a certain way doesn\u2019t make it right.\n\nDevils advocate\u2026if your friends and neighbors suddenly became thieves (robbing others, etc), would that make it OK to act that way too? of course not. There\u2019s a bare minimum standard for being a decent human. Showing compassion. Feeling thankful when others do something nice or thoughtful for you. etc.", "Looking through OPs post history... They seem to have swallowed the flavour aid on some pretty whacked out conspiracy theories.\n\nPlacing my bets on \"OP is the weird aunt/uncle that the kids are trying really hard not to engage with, because they're just slightly off kilter and it makes them very uncomfortable.\"", "It's the gummy bears in the pack that you skip kind of energy but I suspect that the same could be said about me. \ud83d\ude03", "NTA but stop giving them money or gifts. They clearly do not respect you. This way they will learn. You are however YTA for gifting teenage boys fancy 300$ pens that they're never gonna use. This is really ancient and really isn't done anymore", "I got 100 bucks from my grandpa (am lowc with) trough my mom. I tried for a whole week to reach him to at least tell thank you trough the phone. Eventuelle called his wife to tell him SOME WAY that i recieved it and am grateful for the gift. Its not that hard. A call is often enough.", "My dad (50) got my sisters and I (27, 23, and 19) each a pen with our names on it for Christmas last year. One sister is unemployed. Youngest sister is a college student, everything in this day and age is typed/online. I\u2019m a nurse and he intended for me to use it at work. Hell. No. Doctors steal nice shit all the time. \n\nPretty sure all 3 pens are sitting in the gift boxes unused. Mine is in my jewelry box. Told him I\u2019d use it to symbolically write my first prescription (going to NP school).", "Yeah I was gifted about $1000 worth of pens when I graduated Uni, sold one for $100, no offers for the others and I\u2019ve lost them all.\n\nOnly specific people want a pen as a gift and honestly the more expensive the pen, the weirder a gift it is. I\u2019d rather people donate money in my name than get a pen again.", "It shouldn't matter if they liked the gifts or not. Someone cared about them enough to buy them a gift for graduation. They should thank her for thinking of them.", "If my sister would send my kids (whom I did not teach to write thank you notes lol) a gift of 10 bucks they'd call her to thank her.\n\nIt sounds like she doesn't actually have contact with those nieces and nephews and just sends them way too expensive things and expects gratitude.", "Agreed. Additionally, those were unsolicited gifts. In an angle, you're basically forcing a gift upon them and forcing them to do something for you -- writing a thank you letter. \n\nIf you didn't expect they receive it or they write back a thank you letter, that would be acceptable, you would be a golden NTA.\n\nIf you didn't complain about not getting a written thank you letter, you would be regular NTA", "Yeah, if I got something like that for grad when I was 17 I would have been so hurt because I would have felt like my relative didn't care about me as a person and didn't care to get to know me and get something I'd like, or even something generic I could use if I'm moving out. In a way, the $300 makes it worse, because it's not like money was an issue. The chances that both teens graduating were into expensive ugly-ass pens is incredibly low. Plus pens like that are relatively high maintenance, so it's way less convenient than a 10\u00a2 bic pen. \n\nWhen I was 12 my parents went out of their way to get me a pink version of an Xmas gift expecting me to love it, despite me being incredibly vocal about my hatred of the colour pink basically since I was old enough to speak it. I felt like they either didn't listen to me or knew and ignored my preferences and it hurt so bad, and honestly still hurts a little when I think about it a decade later. It's not hard for OP to talk to her nieces and nephews and find out what they like, or talk to their parents and find out what supplies they need instead of buying them what she would want, either without paying attention to what they would enjoy, or while consciously ignoring it because she thinks her preferences are better.\n\nI understand wanting a thank you call, not so much a note lol, but I also understand not wanting to call or write a thank you to someone who, in your eyes, just spent $300 to tell you they don't care about what makes you happy.", "I agree and I want to add:\n\nYou can decide for yourself whatever consequence follows for not having a thank you. It\u2019s all completely legitimate. But find that reason by yourself: you don\u2019t want to offer a gift when you aren\u2019t properly offered a thank you.\n\nDon\u2019t involve in the discussion whether children should learn to properly say thank you. How your sister raises her child is none of your business.", "The next time you get the urge to send expensive gifts to your nieces and nephews remember this and send them a card. No gift, no money, just a card. If they can\u2019t even say thank you, they don\u2019t deserve it.", "That\u2019s a matter of basic manners and I agree with you. My point is that I\u2019d be way more inclined to be grateful of a gift I really like, instead of something I\u2019d toss in the drawer of forgotten stuff.", "Thank you notes are not a thing everywhere. I am an immigrant in the US and I have virtually seen NOBODY send or receive actual thank you card in the mail in my home country. \n\nI will thank you for your gift the next time I see you or I might text you if we don\u2019t see each other. If it was some older acquaintance who sent the gift, my parents would make me call and say thank you. Never ever had sent a \u201cnote\u201d.", "But this is *not* an in-person exchange. The way it is written, OP sounds like she specifically is requesting receipts of their gratitude. It\u2019s not rude to thank her verbally the next time they see her.", "That was absolutely the vibe I got, and her history implies to me that she's probably the sort of person who goes on rants about so deep, flat earth style conspiracies.\n\nThese kids are super uncomfortable and want nothing to do with her, and she's sending gifts so expensive that they feel obligated to reach out because ItS bASiC mAnNeRs.", "I\u2019d honestly rather not get a gift than write a thank you note. The whole process gives me anxiety. I also hate receiving thank you notes or being thanked in general. When I do something nice I do it will no expectations.\n\nOur baby shower was a nightmare. Our daughter was almost a year old before I got the thank you cards out.", "I'd like to propose an alternate version.  This aunt is in a QAnon style cult, by the looks of it, and the kids want nothing to do with her, so she's sending gifts that are too expensive and lavish to ignore so they'll be forced to interact with her.", "It's when you get a thank you NOTE for your thank you note(that you know it's an older person....)", "wow i had one of those 'unknown gifters as well. my mother's best friend from high school came to our home to visit after not having seen my mom in nearly 30 years. i was very young & don't remember her at all, but every year on our birthdays she would send all 6 of us money. my older siblings met her during that visit, but she had already been sending the birthday money for over 20 years at that point. wild.", "I\u2019d definitely be happy with a text but I remember a teacher at school giving a long sermon about how it is nicer to send a letter or note because older people like it and they can keep it forever. Maybe a generational thing.", "If you're so scared of them that you can't say thank you, then don't accept the gift in the first place.", "Oh dang... Yeah, if I was 14, I'd be getting a weird vibe off OP and want nothing to do with them.\n\nI got a real \"buying the kid's love\" vibe even just off this post, where OP seems to be buying expensive gifts exclusively because they want to be thanked, and not because they want to make the other person happy.\n\nBut the conspiracy theories, the UFO shit... Yeah, that's got to be leaking out into real relationships"]}
