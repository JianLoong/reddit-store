For a low-value gift, a short text is fine. For a $1,500 gift, if the kid just wrote \u201cThanks for gift\u201d in a text and sent it off, I think that is a little low-effort. Something like \u201cThanks for the gift, I love the color and appreciate you thinking of me!\u201d would be ok. \n\nI got a lot of gifts when we had our daughter two years ago, and eventually with all the newborn craziness I ditched formal thank-you notes, but instead I took a photo of baby with the gift, and texted it to the giver with a 1-2 line note of appreciation.

The kids might not be aware of where the money even came from.\n\nAgain, I think it's a lesson on giving. Give because you want to and don't expect anything else.", "Agreed.

Our family sends graduation stuff to nieces and nephews because someone did it once and now its a cycle. Bob has to send a gift to Jims kids, because Jim sent Bob's kids a gift.
