{"id": 31641, "submission_id": "182wyc3", "title": "WIBTA if I brought different food to family Xmas dinner for son who is a picky eater?", "selftext": "My son is 10 and probably has Autism but we haven't tested him yet (appointment is months out still). He's a very picky eater and tries really hard to be polite about it but he's very blunt and it comes off as rude sometimes. (Example: \"it's gross/tastes bad\")\n\nHe tries new foods daily, so it isn't a lack of trying on his part. And I know his aversion is real because I've watched him throw up after trying to eat a grape.\n\nMy birth mother is offended by his aversion tho and I'm dreading xmas dinner. \n\nI've tried talking to her about it and she \"tried\" making last years Xmas dinner something he would like.. but I also wonder if she didn't sabotage dinner out of spite.. she asked me what he eats, and I listed off a few things: spaghetti and tomato soup being a couple of them and offered to bring his meal so she could make whatever she wanted. \n\nInstead she made spaghetti with tomato soup as the sauce and... well, even I thought it was gross. My son doing is absolute best to be polite said nothing and just happily ate his roll. My birth mother was fuming tho and kept nagging him about why he wasn't eating. The night ended with him in tears and her refusing to let him have any of the cookies she made. She even called me right after we left her house to complain about him some more.\n\nThis year, I'm thinking about just not saying anything to her and bringing extra sides (for everyone) and deserts that he will eat so he isn't put in that situation again. But I'm worried that would make us look even worse. Idk how to get thru this dinner without someone getting hurt over food.\n\nWe can't miss Xmas because my grandmother just turned 84 and it isn't looking like we'll have her for much longer and we all love our grandma enough to deal with my birth monster.\n\nWIBTA?\n\n\nEdit: to answer a couple questions, when I say \"my son tries new foods daily\" I'm also referring to new combinations. (Example: noodles with a new sauce, or rice with beans mixed in ect). He prefers his foods very singular. Just rice, broccoli on the side. Noodles with alfredo sauce, plain chicken on the side. Nothing touching. Ect. He hates all condiments - but I almost had him liking ranch for a hot second.. but on the third bite he gagged. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnd the couple messages I got about labeling my son as autistic just because he's a picky eater... it's not just because of that but since that isn't relevant at all to the situation, theres no reason to include it.", "created_utc": 1700846071, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182wyc3/wibta_if_i_brought_different_food_to_family_xmas/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sorry your bmother is like this. It really does sound as if she mixed 2 of his accepted foods on purpose just to mess with him/you. Bring food for your son. If she has an issue with it...well, I don't know. I'd spend my time with the family members I love (like grandmother!) and avoid bmother.", "NTA. Your Mom is an ass by purposefully screwing up a very reasonable request (spaghettis is very easy to make). \n\nEventually let your son eat before you arrive there (so he doesn't feel tortured), and bring the dessert? Then whatever happens in-between, your son will feel okay!", "NTA.\n\nAs others suggested, bring food specifically for him. Perhaps what you can do though is bring a few sides that he typically likes as the main food you bring, but have a thermos with \"back up food\" for him that you leave in the car or bag or whatever. Something that doesn't need to be warmed up further, so he can discretely grab it himself and go eat it if needed. \n\nAnd then make sure you have a chat with your child ahead of time. Tell him the plan, and that you'll have back up food with just in case, so he doesn't need to worry. Make up a code word/phrase so he can use that if needed for any reason. Make sure he knows that your bmother may say something rude, but he's free to just ignore it in this situation. Talk with him to make sure he understands that bmother has her own things to work through, and none of it is personal to him even though it might feel that way. Let him know that your #1 priority is making sure he's got food and is ok.", "NTA - Your mother is, and I wouldn't care what she thinks if you brought your own food for your son.", "NTA good for your son for trying. Make plans to visit your grandma near the holiday so that you can bring your dishes and tell your mom that if she\u2019s going to make it a problem, you don\u2019t have to be there and she can just never see your family. I have a feeling this is just a small snapshot of the problems she gives you.", "Bting the food. Also, bring a dessert for just him, but try not to let him or anybody else know about it, so if she throws a fit and takes away dessert, you have something to give him. Let her know up front that if there is any problem with what for he is or is not eating, you will leave. If a problem arises, promptly get him to the car and say your goodbyes before it reaches him crying.", "Take your childs meal.and tell her if she says one word then you will leave .", "NTA. As an autistic person, he needs his safe foods. Holidays are hard enough for autistic people with all the changes in routine, your family should be able to accommodate him and allow him to have whatever food he wants.", "Bring your own food if you have to and remind your birth monster that you don't HAVE to visit her once grandma reaches the pearly gates.", "NTA Bringing some sides that you know he will eat to share with everyone is a great idea.\n\nIf she says anything just say it\u2019s Christmas you\u2019d rather him enjoy the holiday instead of forcing new foods down his throat. There\u2019s 364 other days to do that. \n\nHe\u2019s not \u201cpicky\u201d he physically can\u2019t eat the things. (I have similar issues with food myself. I will try everything but the texture or taste can make me gag.) \n\nIt\u2019s similar to being lactose intolerant, celiac, food allergy, diabetic, etc. He can\u2019t control it, you\u2019re just accommodating his food issue. \n\nVegans and vegetarians bring their own food as well.", "YNTA. From the sounds of it, and the little un professional knowledge I have, it does sound like he is on the spectrum, though it sounds like he is also highly functional. I personally have to commend him on actually TRYING new foods all the time. I personally would take some extra sides, and don't worry about what is said. I've been to plenty of thanksgiving dinners where people did that if there were dietary restrictions for ANY reason", "Idk about this one because maybe she sincerely messed up if, when she asked what he likes and you told her spaghetti and tomato soup, maybe she did think that you meant he likes them mixed together? Like, if I asked someone what they liked, and they said spaghetti and meatballs, I would assume that they like those things together as one dish, and not that they meant just plain or buttered spaghetti noodles and, separately, meatballs on their own. So this could be a miscommunication on your part coupled with maybe an oversensitivity to perceived slights on her part. I can only guess there may be a history of behavior like this, though, so I don't know if she purposely sabotaged the evening or what. As it stands, I'd go with ETA OR NAH.", "Not being rude, but thanksgiving dinners usually have a lot of options, there\u2019s nothing he likes but rolls?  Is this the only reason you think he\u2019s autistic?  Your birth mom is rude tho. I would ask him what he would like to bring to eat. Then just do it.  If bm doesn\u2019t like it then tell her next year you won\u2019t bother coming if it\u2019s such an ordeal for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If a kid is just being picky, then letting them have their way all the time isn't doing them any favors. (I was that kid.) This is a more serious food aversion. Bring food that he'll eat.\n\nThat said...I wouldn't blame her for the \"spaghetti with tomato soup as the sauce\" bit because *that* part sounds well-intentioned. The stuff after, not well-intentioned.", "NTA at all. I would bring food for him or have him eat before you go. If your mother continues to act obnoxious about it, just stop going. It's not worth it.", "NTA \n\nMy nephew has sensory issues with food. At Christmas he eats sausages and chocolate. One year he got brave and tried a potato. \n\nNo one cares.

The right answer is exactly what you suggest. You bring stuff you know your kid will eat and don't expect someone else to go out of their way for that. \n\nSo you're doing the right thing there. Birth Mom is the AH for last year and she will be again if she makes an issue out of you bringing food that you know your kid will eat. \n\nIt's no different than if you were a vegan and no one else was. Perfectly reasonable to bring your own vegan meal while everyone else eats the food that Mom prepared.", "NTA- Bring enough for everyone and let your son enjoy his holiday. If your birth mother complains, tell her you wanted to help with the meal. If she pushes it, remain calm and make her look irrational.", "NTA\n\nHave him eat something at home before you go so he isn\u2019t hungry.

Keep up with reminders to be polite at the dinner table. That is important.  \n\nI have a family that comes visits and the youngest is difficult to please with food. I would rather mom bring him food then to try and tailor the entire meal to his tastes. However I appreciate Mom keeps trying to expand his palate", "Nope. She\u2019s an awful person and I wouldn\u2019t put up with it for one more second! Bring something your son likes to eat and tell your birth mother you are done with her antics.", "ngl the way you worded this did make me think you meant spaghetti + tomato soup together. however NTA bc she could've asked for clarification and she shouldn't have overreacted when your son didn't eat it.", "NTA Ive always been very picky, it\u2019s never been a problem to anyone for my parents or I to just bring a dish or two I know I\u2019ll like to family gatherings. I\u2019m not even neurodivergent, and the adults in my life still managed to not take offense to my different taste buds. He\u2019s not being rude, and come on, even the most adventurous kid wants to fuck up the rolls at thanksgiving.\nFrankly she sounds like she\u2019d strongly contribute to a future ED in you son if she had it her way.", "NTA. Take your son's safe food and if Mom opens her mouth remind her that his food choice doesn't have anything to do with her prepared meal.  \n\nAutism hasn't always been so widely recognized.  Moms probably from the before times and doesn't understand that the child isn't \"just picky\".", "NTA.   My son had some preferences re food he would eat, vs food he wouldn't.   Ex:  he liked baked potatoes but not mashed potatoes.   Apple slices, but not apple sauce.  Cake or cookies,  but not pie.  Chicken but not turkey.   So I did fix him chicken, baked potato and cookies, while the rest of us feasted on a more traditional holiday meal.  No one cared.  The point was to share the holiday together, with everyone enjoying the day and the meal.  Sorry your birth mom is lacking the kindness gene.", "NTA and just take extra food that everyone else will also eat.  Others can deal with it.", "I'd bet on it that she purposely made it wrong. My mom used to do this too and I swear she just wanted something to throw a fit over or an excuse to punish you for something she wanted to get out of doing. She would use not eating your dinner as a means to take things away so if there was an event coming up that she really didn't want to take you to but already promised she would, she'd purposely ruin dinner that night or just tweak it so you wouldn't eat it, so she'd be justified in denying taking you all of a sudden. I recall one time it was my turn to pick what movie we were going to see. I can only assume she didn't want to admit she couldn't really afford the movie because I made it a point to ask for something for dinner you couldn't possibly spoil. Macaroni and cheese. She's always made it the same way but this night she all of a sudden threw a tomato in a blender - a hot house tomato you use for sandwiches and not sauces, skin and all - and pureed it and dumped it all over the macaroni knowing full bone of us was going to eat it so she could take away movie night. It was a huge fight because she knew what she did and wasnt expecting to be called out on it.", "I agree, trying new foods is brave. A special dinner is not the time to be brave.", "Many choices or not, if the foods aren\u2019t \u201csafe foods\u201d for that person, sometimes rolls are the only option. \n\nHe might normally eat carrots, but BM\u2019s carrots might have glaze and parsley on them. \n\nI have a child who ate maybe 6 things until they were 14. Nothing that was wet (soup, sauces, condiments). Very plain, unadorned food. They did eventually grow out of it, but I wanted a happy, fed child. I didn\u2019t tackle her eating issues at a big family dinner\u2026 that was for hometime.\n\nOP, you are NTA. Good for you for being proactive."]}
