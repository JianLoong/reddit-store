My son doing is absolute best to be polite said nothing and just happily ate his roll. My birth mother was fuming tho and kept nagging him about why he wasn't eating. The night ended with him in tears and her refusing to let him have any of the cookies she made.

(Example: noodles with a new sauce, or rice with beans mixed in ect). He prefers his foods very singular. Just rice, broccoli on the side. Noodles with alfredo sauce, plain chicken on the side.

Perhaps what you can do though is bring a few sides that he typically likes as the main food you bring, but have a thermos with \"back up food\" for him that you leave in the car or bag or whatever. Something that doesn't need to be warmed up further, so he can discretely grab it himself and go eat it if needed. \n\nAnd then make sure you have a chat with your child ahead of time. Tell him the plan, and that you'll have back up food with just in case, so he doesn't need to worry. Make up a code word/phrase so he can use that if needed for any reason. Make sure he knows that your bmother may say something rude, but he's free to just ignore it in this situation.

I will try everything but the texture or taste can make me gag.) \n\nIt\u2019s similar to being lactose intolerant, celiac, food allergy, diabetic, etc. He can\u2019t control it, you\u2019re just accommodating his food issue. \n\nVegans and vegetarians bring their own food as well.", "YNTA.

I've been to plenty of thanksgiving dinners where people did that if there were dietary restrictions for ANY reason", "Idk about this one because maybe she sincerely messed up if, when she asked what he likes and you told her spaghetti and tomato soup, maybe she did think that you meant he likes them mixed together? Like, if I asked someone what they liked, and they said spaghetti and meatballs, I would assume that they like those things together as one dish, and not that they meant just plain or buttered spaghetti noodles and, separately, meatballs on their own. So this could be a miscommunication on your part coupled with maybe an oversensitivity to perceived slights on her part. I can only guess there may be a history of behavior like this, though, so I don't know if she purposely sabotaged the evening or what. As it stands, I'd go with ETA OR NAH.", "Not being rude, but thanksgiving dinners usually have a lot of options, there\u2019s nothing he likes but rolls?

I recall one time it was my turn to pick what movie we were going to see. I can only assume she didn't want to admit she couldn't really afford the movie because I made it a point to ask for something for dinner you couldn't possibly spoil. Macaroni and cheese. She's always made it the same way but this night she all of a sudden threw a tomato in a blender - a hot house tomato you use for sandwiches and not sauces, skin and all - and pureed it and dumped it all over the macaroni knowing full bone of us was going to eat it so she could take away movie night.

We started off just by bringing canned peas to the holidays, now my great aunt (who hosts thanksgiving) has now basically given me permission to grab a can of peas out of her cupboard and heat them up for myself \ud83e\udd7a.

You have the right idea to bring extra sides that can be shared with the group. It helps with a child's confidence to be able to share their likes and dislikes without judgement. Many grownups will be very willing to talk about their own food likes and dislikes. They may even mention foods and combinations that your son will find interesting and worth testing. \n\nDo what you need to do to feed your son at these gatherings.
