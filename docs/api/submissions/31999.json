Clearly they were hoping to use your uncle's anxiety as an excuse to try to prevent you from meeting with your boyfriend. \n\nI've had issues with things like this in the past with family members that I once considered myself very close to and people I really enjoyed spending time with. Once I grew up and became an adult they really struggled with that transition and suddenly escalated efforts to control me, control who I was spending time with, control my social media posts (not racy at all btw) because they just couldn't handle that I was an adult and not necessarily going to do whatever they said. They viewed me as being disobedient, defiant, slutty etc. But really I just....didn't actually have to obey them anymore. I could make my own decisions which didn't always align with what they wanted. I was never rude, cussed them out or had tantrums or things like that. I  would just say something like \"oh thanks for letting me know I'll have to think about that\" or \"I've thought on it and I'm not doing to do that\" but they would just freak out and actually cut contact with me for years. It was so bizarre and shocking at the time. But this pattern was repeated with my younger cousins too so it really seems to be an issue with them. Apparently our relationship could only be good if I was constantly submissive and obedient..\n\nMany years later I have a friendly, but shallow, relationship with them. We are fine at family gatherings but they aren't people I would confide in and I generally have them on an info diet. Sorry you're going through this but I have yet to see any real recovery from this kind of issue. I think you should put some space between you, mourn the relationship, and start building ties elsewhere while keeping the door open for future reconciliation.", "I'm really sad for you. It sounds like a lot of your trust was broken for weird reasons that don't make sense. What's more, you sound more responsible than like 50% of the people that post here--you're 19 with a long-term boyfriend and a job, you didn't flip out on your unreasonable family, and you went to a hotel and let everyone know where you were. You did everything right. \n\nFor some reason, some parental figures seem to have a lot of trouble with female sexuality, and it sounds like they're decided to shame you based on some wild assumptions they've made. They owe you a huge apology and an explanation as to why they suddenly decided you are immoral. \n\nHang in there, friend. Keep standing up for yourself.", "Girl NTA I would totally leave that house and if your aunt and uncle try to ask why let them know that you\u2019re an adult in a consenting relationship with an adult and you will not be spoken to so disrespectfully", "NTA;  Your actions are reasonable, their hospitality could no longer be accepted with the condition they gave.\n\nThis is a definite case of a Phyrric victories on their end.  I would be be petty and keep a long memory of this.  My mother pulled a similar stunt when I returned to their home city for a friend's wedding, I stopped staying with her for holidays if it interfered with my girlfriend.", "NTA your uncle and aunt suck and I\u2019d never talk to them again.", "NTA they don\u2019t respect you as an adult.  Don\u2019t rely on them anymore unless it\u2019s life or death.", "NTA\n\nAnd even if it had been like you were meeting a random person, it'd *still* be NTA, since as you mention, you're an adult.\n\nAt least you got a great night in the hotel out of it, instead of a miserable night in your room/his couch where you'd either have felt miserable for not getting together, or guilty if you gave into the temptation behind their backs.  The anxiety and OCD is something to feel sorry for and forgive perhaps, but the slut shaming attitude (from your aunt too, she doesn't seem to have anxiety or OCD) isn't.  They should be feeling apologetic for that.", "This is the time you go No Contact until they apologize \n\nI\u2019m talking years. YEARS.", "NTA\n\nYou are an adult.", "NTA. Tell them to mind their own business. Go LC with them for awhile. You don\u2019t need that kind of negativity around you. Decline to go next summer.", "NTA. Sorry they turned out to be so judgemental. Yeah the relationship is ruined but that happens in life and its not your fault. And maybe they are just finally showing their true colors. It happens. Move on. I personally would give them a 6 month time out by going no contact. If they really love you they will show it when you reach out. Its creepy that they are judging the sex life of an adult.", "NTA, but they have showed their colors, now you can write them off.  If they ask you to visit, just say, \"sorry, no\".  No need to give reasons when they demand them, just \"sorry, no\".   \n    \nThey screwed you over, not that it will have long term impact, but it shows they only care about you when you do what they want.", "Agree.  They\u2019re treating it like she had a one night stand, instead of meeting her boyfriend of nearly a year.\n\nIF they hoped to prevent them having sex, they should have let him stay on the couch and her in her room.  But, maybe they were afraid he\u2019d sneak in her room, have sex and get pregnant, and it ALL happened on THEIR watch. \n\nYou have your life to live.  They have hang-ups, but they never should have insulted you like that.  That\u2019s what they think, though, but now you know.", "Every time I read about situations similar to this, I feel like the older adults really just want to take their hats off their heads and slap the ground with it while shouting \u201cDamn it! You were supposed to struggle! Not find an easy way out!\u201d"]}
