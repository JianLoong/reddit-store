Strap in, because this story might ruffle some feathers.\n\nSo, my girlfriend has always had some expensive hobbies. She's into high-end fashion, luxury makeup, and all things fancy. Now, don't get me wrong, I respect her interests and choices, but recently, things have gotten out of hand.\n\nWe both work full-time jobs and contribute equally to our shared expenses, including rent, groceries, and bills. However, my girlfriend has started splurging an exorbitant amount of money on her hobbies without consulting me or considering our joint financial goals.\n\nJust last month, she spent a ridiculous sum on a designer handbag and a couple of high-end makeup products. I was shocked when I found out how much she spent because we had agreed to save up for a future vacation. When I confronted her about it, she brushed it off as \"self-care\" and said that I should be supportive of her interests.\n\nNow, I'm all for self-expression and pursuing one's passions, but not at the expense of our financial stability. We had set clear goals as a couple, and she disregarded them completely. I explained my concerns, emphasizing that we need to save for important things like emergencies, future investments, and yes, that much-needed vacation.\n\nDespite my attempts to reason with her, she continues to spend large sums of money on her hobbies, leaving me feeling frustrated and neglected. It's not like I'm asking her to give up her interests entirely, but I believe there should be a balance between indulging in hobbies and being responsible with our finances.\n\nI turn to you for your judgment. AITA for refusing to pay for my girlfriend's expensive hobbies when she's not considering our financial goals? Should I just bite my tongue and let her spend as she pleases, or is it time to have a serious conversation about our priorities?\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend spends a fortune on expensive hobbies, ignoring our joint financial goals. I refuse to pay for them and believe it's time for a serious conversation.

You might be able to tolerate this now, but what happens if you have kids and she's not working or working as much and all the finances are on you... but she continues spending money on things for her and less on the kids and the family expenses.\n\nPerhaps the both of you see a financial counsellor... but I suspect she's not going to because she wants to spend her money how she wants to.

Once we were married and had kids, I was a sole provider, and it got steadily worse.  There was a stretch of five years where I didn\u2019t buy an article of clothing for myself, and didn\u2019t feel like I could afford to join the folks at the office for lunch out.  \n\nThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was a $1,000 contribution to a charity, without even mentioning it to me.\n\nIn the end, we got divorced, and then I got raked all over again for half my retirement, half the value of the house, and half the possessions.  It has taken a long time to dig out of that hole.\n\nOP, your girlfriend is not my ex-wife, but she sure sounds similar, and so a) NTA and b) when someone shows you who they are, *believe them.*  I get chills reading your post. This is not a red flag, it\u2019s a neon red billboard.", "I agree but I don't understand how this makes her an asshole?", "So what about the vacation? Or you just going to gloss over that?", "She is spending her money on high maintenance fashion, and contributing nothing to agreed upon vacation and future joint goals.  That affects him directly.  Suggest you reread all of his post.", "> that OP thinks should be going toward this vacation?\n\nFrom the post I understood it rather as \"that they agreed would be set aside\".", "Looooool amazing spot", "She doesn't save money for the vacation, future investments or for emergency. Only the OP is contributing for those, which is not okay.", "Or learning about fashion and how to put outfits together. It IS a whole industry, putting together outfits. Not MY industry, but there are a lot of fashion consultants out there.", "I\u2019m also questioning how much he actually benefits from/expects to have an immaculately made up girlfriend wearing designer clothes. Like if she stopped wearing expensive makeup and luxury brands would he just be cool with it?", "I\u2019m sure you think you prefer women without makeup too, until you see what women actually look like without any makeup.", "Separate bank accounts, and this. \n\n\"I paid for it with my own money'", "Right I agree with ALL of this entirely but theres a bit of a sell and giveaway in the framing which means this isn't irrelevant. \n\nIf he had said AITA for being pissed off my GF spends her money on handbags when I want to go on a fancy holiday \n\nWell we'd be thinking about if they have different goals in life and that makes them incompatible \n\nBut it IS relevant he says \"spend MY money on HER hobbies\" because it maybe gives away something about his behaviour and attitude in the relationship. Are they shared goals? The framing of it all has me questioning if she has these lofty saving goals or he does and expects her to conform to them. \n\nRegardless, in no way is it his money being spent on handbags, as far as he's told so far. Her money doesn't become his for their joint projects either. It is at absolutely best \"our money\". \n\nUltimately they just don't sound very compatible.", "Consumerism is a hobby?", "\"an activity done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure.\"\n\nBy definition, yes, it can be. May not be a compatible lifestyle for partners, but yes, shopping can be a hobby.", "That\u2019s a job, not a hobby. Buying 6k dollar handbags is not a hobby.", "Been saying this for years! Women just don't look good without expensive handbags.", "Agreed. Not a sport. Doesn't pass the Sombrero Rule. \n\nIf you can do it with a sombrero on your head not tied down, and the sombrero is going to stay on your head? Not a sport. Might require skill, sure, but it's not a sport. \n\nIce hockey? That sombrero's coming right off. Sport. Tennis? Sport. 100m dash? Sport. \n\nGolf? Not a sport. Hobby. Requires skill. Not a sport. \n\nSwing dancing? I'd say that's a sport. Waltz? Not a sport. \n\nShopping, not a sport. \n\nCollecting? Absolutely a hobby. Need to know about the stuff you're collecting, collectors know the value of their collections. Not a sport.", "Not saying I disagree but you don't spend thousands on starwars, unless your super rich or completely obsessed. Imagine telling your girlfriend you spend $1500 on an ewok fur satchel, $80 some jabbacado face moisturiser and $350 for makeup and prosthetics so you can be a twilek \ud83e\udd23, I'm sure most would support your hobby lol", "playing footballs is a hobby, you don\u2019t collect footballs just because you play footballs.", "You're right, they are jobs in the industry that was created by people who were really good at their hobby and were paid by OTHER people who noticed they had a skill those other people didn't have.", "I mean...if wine-tasting can be a hobby, then I don't see why cake-tasting or running a blog about local bakeries couldn't be!", "Yeah, if that's what you regularly choose to go do in your free time, find or bake cakes and then eat them, sure.", "You can talk to my wife about my wardrobe of football shirts. Incredibly essential I tell her, for my hobby.", "You put /s afterwards", "An interest in it? No. Acquiring materials and practicing skills to get better at it? Yes. \n\nPer Oxford: \"an activity done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure.\"", "Well, styling outfits can even be a job - if it's serious enough for stylists to exist as a profession, then how is it somehow not serious enough as a hobby?\n\nAlso, collecting stamps is considered a hobby - how is collecting fashion items not?\n\nI'm not saying it being a hobby makes spending more than you can afford a good thing, but I don't see how it's not a hobby.", "Yeah, styling occupies that space between design and art. Plenty of professional stylists (hair, food, fashion, window dressing etc) would have started out the hobby route, assembling/trying looks \n\ni don\u2019t think consumerism/shopping is much of a hobby, but we only have OPs take on things. She could collect/read/research and follow trends and designers etc."]}
