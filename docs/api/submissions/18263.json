Strap in, because this story might ruffle some feathers.\n\nSo, my girlfriend has always had some expensive hobbies. She's into high-end fashion, luxury makeup, and all things fancy. Now, don't get me wrong, I respect her interests and choices, but recently, things have gotten out of hand.\n\nWe both work full-time jobs and contribute equally to our shared expenses, including rent, groceries, and bills. However, my girlfriend has started splurging an exorbitant amount of money on her hobbies without consulting me or considering our joint financial goals.\n\nJust last month, she spent a ridiculous sum on a designer handbag and a couple of high-end makeup products. I was shocked when I found out how much she spent because we had agreed to save up for a future vacation. When I confronted her about it, she brushed it off as \"self-care\" and said that I should be supportive of her interests.\n\nNow, I'm all for self-expression and pursuing one's passions, but not at the expense of our financial stability. We had set clear goals as a couple, and she disregarded them completely. I explained my concerns, emphasizing that we need to save for important things like emergencies, future investments, and yes, that much-needed vacation.\n\nDespite my attempts to reason with her, she continues to spend large sums of money on her hobbies, leaving me feeling frustrated and neglected. It's not like I'm asking her to give up her interests entirely, but I believe there should be a balance between indulging in hobbies and being responsible with our finances.\n\nI turn to you for your judgment. AITA for refusing to pay for my girlfriend's expensive hobbies when she's not considering our financial goals? Should I just bite my tongue and let her spend as she pleases, or is it time to have a serious conversation about our priorities?\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend spends a fortune on expensive hobbies, ignoring our joint financial goals. I refuse to pay for them and believe it's time for a serious conversation.

And how much are we talking, in comparison to say how much you pay on rent?", "INFO:You have not said explicitly whether or not she's contributing to the savings, only that she's spending money in a way you don't approve of.  Is she putting money into the savings or not?", "INFO\n\n*What* hobbies?\n\nAll you've described *here* is \"shopping.\" Having expensive taste isn't a \"hobby.\"", "INFO is she spending her own money or your money?", "INFO: you both work and contribute to the household so how are YOU paying for her expenses exactly? Do you have a joint bank account and is she literally spending YOUR paycheck on luxury handbags and makeup beyond what she earns herself?\n\nOr are you simply referring to opportunity cost - what she spends on luxuries, she isn't contributing to longer term joint financial goals, so in that sense your goals are delayed. If this is what you mean, she is costing you, yes, but you aren't actually paying for her makeup.", "INFO: How are you paying or expected to pay? It sounds like she is paying for her own things", "INFO: Has she asked you to foot more than your agreed share of joint expenses because of this?", "OP - after reading your posting a few times, what you're saying is that you have your finances comingled (Mistake #1), and you're not on the same page for your financial goals (Mistake #2).  You need to quit putting your money into an account with just your name on it and explain to her that you can reimburse her for your half of the household bills or vice versa, and any \"hobby expenses\" are all on her and no longer on your dime as long as you're both living together.  It's obvious that you're not a match financially and you both should either come to a formal agreement to get on the same page or go your separate ways because she's the only one reaping the rewards since you're not getting any enjoyment out of the fashion clothes and designer makeup.  The quicker you pull that band aid the more money you're going to save in the end.", "NTA\n\nIf she is spending money from your joint account to pay for her luxuries, then you should close the joint account.  Nor should you contribute more toward joint bills if she runs low due to overspending.\n\nIf GF is spending all of her personal money and doesn't have anything saved for a vacation, then consider going away without her.", "NTA\n\nYou mentioned \"joint financial goals\" as a couple.\n\nLooks like only one of you shares those goals. I think the bit of about \"consulting me\" might ruffle some feathers but financial goals are real, whether you're budgeting for handbags or sport tickets. You both need to sit down and have a conversation about what you are working towards/value. I don't want to totally write off her purchases - big ticket items can hold re-sale value and could be important in her line of work. Can she buy something similar second hand? What value does it hold her for? Does she still plan on taking a vacation or is the big ticket purchase the vacation and you'll be going by yourself? \n\nLooks like it's time to reassess what you both want//value/are working towards", "NTA. If you agreed to save $XXX amount from each of you for vacation, she needs to cover her portion, and from your description, it sounds like she is blowing off money that she needs to cover it on makeup and designer accessories. That's a breach of agreement right there, and that's what you need to be concentrating on, not what she is spending money on, but rather her breaking her promise to contribute $XXX amount to your common goal.", "NTA, but it\u2019s also not your place to tell her what she can spend her money on. \n\nIf that\u2019s what she wants to spend it on, then it\u2019s up to you to decide whether you will continue to be in the relationship with her. \n\nAfter all, at this point I can\u2019t see that she is not paying her bills or asking you for money to pay them. She just isn\u2019t \u201cdoing what you want her to do with the money\u201d and put it away for that rainy day.\n\nSo you actually aren\u2019t in fact paying for her hobbies, she is. So YTA for the false title, and for trying to force someone to do what you want them to do. Life is too short to be unhappy and if she wants to spend money on a handbag, and she can afford it, leave her be. And just get on with managing your own finances.", "Your acting like your finances are combined when they aren\u2019t so maybe YTA but also maybe you guys just aren\u2019t right for each other.", "NTA if you two can't get on the same page on financial planning, then what kind of future can you build together? Have the discussion, then decide if you want to stay in that relationship long term. Because if you can't come to a mutual understanding now, what hope do you have in the future. Definitely do NOT consider marrying her while this is an issue. You WILL regret it.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you are on different pages when it comes to your financial goals.  She wants to spend every cent she earns, you want to save it to get bigger and better things (ie a house, thinking about retirement and investments, she's living in the moment).\n\nA common cause of divorce is fighting about money.\n\nIf neither of you want to make compromises then you may have to rethink the relationship no matter how much you love her.  You might be able to tolerate this now, but what happens if you have kids and she's not working or working as much and all the finances are on you... but she continues spending money on things for her and less on the kids and the family expenses.\n\nPerhaps the both of you see a financial counsellor... but I suspect she's not going to because she wants to spend her money how she wants to.  She is within her right to do that as she's spending her own money.. but it just shows that you may be financially incompatible which is a deal breaker for many.", "YTA. If she continues to contribute the same amount to your shared expenses, it's none of your business what she does with the rest of her money. If the time comes for the vacation, and she doesn't have her half, then _maybe_ you can complain. Or maybe you should go on a cheaper vacation. If she doesn't prioritize using her disposable income on an expensive vacation, that might be because traveling is _your_ hobby, and she's just along for the ride. If you want to go on the expensive vacation, maybe you should pay for the upgrade. Is that fair? She pays less but benefits equally. But hey, you benefit from having a pretty girlfriend without paying for the things that make her pretty, too.", "Why do you have a joint account with a girlfriend?\n\nThat's a huge mistake.", "You talk in terms of 'we'.  She is only talking and acting in terms of 'me'.  Has she always been this selfish?

You are NTA", "YTA - No where do you state she is spending your money.    She is spending her own money.", "NTA. You're not being unsupportive of her \"hobby\" because it's not a hobby, it's really expensive shopping. Stop calling it a hobby because you're practically gaslighting yourself here dude.", "This is exactly the sort of thing you want to happen before you marry and have kids. Your next financial goal should be to gather enough money to move away and leave this person behind. \n\nNTA", "YTA Your title is misleading. SHE is the one paying for these things. She is still contributing her share of your expenses. Have you set a specific savings goal that you are asking her to contribute to with a specific amount in your monthly budget?\n\nDecide as a couple the amount each of you will set aside each to budget for your goals.
