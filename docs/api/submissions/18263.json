Strap in, because this story might ruffle some feathers.\n\nSo, my girlfriend has always had some expensive hobbies. She's into high-end fashion, luxury makeup, and all things fancy. Now, don't get me wrong, I respect her interests and choices, but recently, things have gotten out of hand.\n\nWe both work full-time jobs and contribute equally to our shared expenses, including rent, groceries, and bills. However, my girlfriend has started splurging an exorbitant amount of money on her hobbies without consulting me or considering our joint financial goals.\n\nJust last month, she spent a ridiculous sum on a designer handbag and a couple of high-end makeup products. I was shocked when I found out how much she spent because we had agreed to save up for a future vacation. When I confronted her about it, she brushed it off as \"self-care\" and said that I should be supportive of her interests.\n\nNow, I'm all for self-expression and pursuing one's passions, but not at the expense of our financial stability. We had set clear goals as a couple, and she disregarded them completely. I explained my concerns, emphasizing that we need to save for important things like emergencies, future investments, and yes, that much-needed vacation.\n\nDespite my attempts to reason with her, she continues to spend large sums of money on her hobbies, leaving me feeling frustrated and neglected. It's not like I'm asking her to give up her interests entirely, but I believe there should be a balance between indulging in hobbies and being responsible with our finances.\n\nI turn to you for your judgment. AITA for refusing to pay for my girlfriend's expensive hobbies when she's not considering our financial goals? Should I just bite my tongue and let her spend as she pleases, or is it time to have a serious conversation about our priorities?\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend spends a fortune on expensive hobbies, ignoring our joint financial goals. I refuse to pay for them and believe it's time for a serious conversation.

You might be able to tolerate this now, but what happens if you have kids and she's not working or working as much and all the finances are on you... but she continues spending money on things for her and less on the kids and the family expenses.\n\nPerhaps the both of you see a financial counsellor... but I suspect she's not going to because she wants to spend her money how she wants to.

Might even go alone on the vacation, since damn, you can't be expected to cover for both after she spends all the set- aside money on her hobbies...", "Do all of the hobbies you refer to involve spending money? The ones you mention are all just shopping.  Yes shopping is technically a hobby because it is a spare time activity (for enjoyment) but shopping can easily become problematic.  It can become compulsive which is a mental health disorder. \n\nThe fact that she is doing it with money she had other uses in mind for is a warning sign.  If she is spending more than she can afford, hiding purchases from others, shopping to cope with emotions, or feeling shame after shopping she may have crossed the line into compulsion or even addiction. There are probably additional warning signs not listed.\n\nA serious couple working on joint finances will have designated amounts set for each expected expense. For you it will also include various savings funds for your emergency nest egg, vacation fund, perhaps a long term savings account and maybe some others that I missed.  The couple would either contribute equal amounts or each put a percent based on their income ratio.  Money left over would serve as a hobby allowance.  Did you two make a specific budget with intended amounts to the various savings areas? \n\nSee if you can have a non heated talk with her about what is important to you and why.  See if she will agree to contributing half or her percent to each budget area.  Maybe you can set up the budget together.  She will be able to see approx how much money is already designated and know that the difference left over is her budget for fun.\n\nIf she is unable to follow through after you come to a specific agreement it\u2019s time to point out and for her to recognize that her spending is problematic.  I would expect her to get help and remedy the problem.\n\nWether she does any of these steps is ultimately up to her.  What\u2019s up to you is deciding if you will continue in the relationship.  I would not immediately dump her especially if I was in love with her.  I would put the effort to get her on the same page and really communicate the financial approach you need to be in a couple.  She might be able to change.  I encourage you to give her that chance.\n\nIf you read all this and thought \u201chell no\u201d that\u2019s a beyond clear sign the relationship is over and it\u2019s time to break it off.", "INFO - what is your financial set up? Are you directly paying for any of her spending, or is it more she is not contributing to a shared account?", "Even if she is spending her own money, if girlfriend is not contributing to their shared goal's budget, then OP either have to pay her share or just discard away their plans. So this affects him. However, he can't dictate how his gf can spend her own money. In my opinion, after a discussion about money and their shared goal's if gf still give priority to her \"hobbies\" over their plans then OP need to either think of a future without her or just accept this is how their finances are going to be in the long run.", "That was literally my first question as well. I don\u2019t think shopping is a *hobby*.", "INFO. When have you ever paid for your GF\u2019s shopping?  All you describe is her paying.", "Also how is he paying for it? It doesn\u2019t like they have joint finances, so she\u2019s paying for stuff out of her pocket?", "HA ha my thoughts exactly hobby/shopping hmmm could I try that???", "But if they had a rapport before and had agreed on specific life goals as to how their life would progress and what the priorities will be, he's indirectly paying for the time loss due to her lavishness which is a sudden surprise and time lost is money lost.\n\nIf she's not respecting the preset priorities the partner has every right to discuss and question the deviation from what they'd been planning since some time.\n\nIt's as good as saying after agreeing on a decent Toyota or Subaru hatchback would suffice for a future family and plans for it are in place, she decides I want a Lamborghini for my own personal use and proceeds to keep pushing deadlines while neglecting the previous plans. Whether they can afford it or not is immaterial here. The lack of respect and dismissive nature of time and effort should be the focus.", "She's paying for her own things, but he's gonna pay for her vacation if she's not contributing equally. She wants the designer expensive bags too and a paid for vacation too.", "Unrelatedly, a bunch of people are being really weird about saying her interests are weird or bad or not a hobby, and it all gives off a really misogynist vibe.\n\nYeesh", "This. NTA. Buying designer handbags isn't a hobby, it's stupid.", "Sure\u2026 he should vacation without her~ only spend his own money, on himself.", "Wtf? Unless OP clarifies a lot of things he's NTA. Gf wants the designer bags and the paid vacation too because It's only OP mostly saving for the vacation. She wants to eat the cake and not get diabetes too from it.", "She may be spending her own money, but when it comes to their agreed upon goals of the vacation, OP will have to pay for gf portion as she is not contributing her share. \n\nThis makes OP NTA.", "Looking good =/= buying designer handbags.", "For real, there's guys who are really into having their partner have a particular look and presentation but then balk at the cost and time it takes", "how is this an addiction, she bought a few things", "Right? Gambling can be a hobby too - if you stay within your means. If it becomes out of control, you can get into a lot of financial trouble.", "That's irrelevant. If you are in an adult relationship and you have joint financial goals that you both agreed on you should do your best to abide by those goals out of respect to the other person. If my boyfriend and I agree that we want to save up to get married or to go on vacation or to buy a house, and he then goes and throws all his money away and puts none of it towards our goal, that means either we won't be able to achieve our goal, or that I'll have to foot the bill for him.\nImo she's being irresponsible and disrespectful and I would honestly reconsider my relationship with her if I were OP.", "Well, so it is. It requires no skill, talent, practice or indeed anything other than a functioning credit card.", "This was my interpretation as well. \n\nOP perhaps put your money in your own seperate account so that YOU have an emergency fund, money for investments and a vacation. And when the time comes for them, you\u2019ve done your bit and she may have to miss out \n\nNTA", "That's why I think he should cut her loose; her goal is gor him to pay for the vacation", "By the way OP described it it very much sounds like an addiction. She refused to cut back and is unable to save . Those arent essential products.", "It's a hobby not a fucking sport Jesus Christ", "I don't collect trading cards but my husband used to collect Magic cards and our younger son collected Pokemon cards.  They spent lots of time organizing them in different ways and building decks for play.  They also would sell or trade the cards they didn't want or need.", "It\u2019s an art medium. Whether or not it\u2019s a hobby depends on interest level.", "Cosmetics, and fashion absolutely can be hobbies. I have a friend who regularly keeps track of designers, and watches shows that are specifically about fashion. They aren't a designer, but they do collect designer clothing, and accessories, and watch, and read most things about the fashion world. \n\nIt's no different than the fact that I love Star Wars, and watch the movies, and shows, read the books, and collect the memorabilia. Hell, my husband, and I literally play Star Wars trivia without a board game. \n\nI can't say I thought I would ever encounter someone literally trying to gatekeep what constitutes as a hobby.", "You seltzer hobbyist, I see you.", "Designing clothes would be the hobby in your example. Following fashion and making  purchasing choices, outfit choices, choosing when to wear them, seems like a hobby too unless you're being hypertechnical and stretching the distinction", "Eh maybe, it doesn\u2019t seem like the vacation is her priority goal due to her willingness to delay it until he saves up if he ever does. I think she made her priority clear and the paid vacation is the unintended result because it is what he wants, but she still benefits. Still not balanced or what was agreed upon so resentment will inevitably seep in unless they do something about it", "so like you don't like handbags and makeup so you think spending nontrivial money on those things is an addiction?", "Does \"eating cake\" count, then?", "It's not about the Iranian seltzer", "It may be worth re-reading the post, I don't think we're getting the same impression from it! The OP just said he had joint financial goals he wanted to meet that this got in the way of in his view.", "Why not if it is something you do regularly in your leisure time for pleasure,  because that is all a hobby is. \n\nMe and a housemate used to have a shared hobby of sampling and rating chocolate fudge cakes, both from supermarkets and cafes. It was something we both had a lot of fun doing.", "When it starts effecting relationships with your partner it's a problem at the very least."]}
