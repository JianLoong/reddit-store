My friend \u201cAubrey\u201d is a bridesmaid. Aubrey has heavy psoriasis and is self conscious about it. She\u2019s wearing a long sleeved dress in the wedding, by her own request. At the time, the only visible places were her arms and legs.\n\nIn recent months, it\u2019s developed on her scalp. She\u2019s had to buy a special shampoo so the patches and flakes don\u2019t show in her hair. Once again, she\u2019s super self conscious. According to her, doing the treatment herself really hurts and makes her feel worse about herself. Her dermatologist prescribed a special shampoo and conditioner that\u2019s supposed to help loosen it so she can brush and comb it out. She does what she can do it doesn\u2019t look too bad, but sometimes she just gives up and the flakes show. They\u2019re big, plaque-like flakes that pop up on her scalp. She wears a lot of hats or hoodies.\n\nThe thing is, I wouldn\u2019t have minded her wearing a short sleeve dress and showing her flakes/plaque on her arms and legs as it\u2019s really not an issue. However, because you can\u2019t see the redness, just the flakes, her hair looks unkempt often. It\u2019s her hair, so I don\u2019t care on every other day\u2026.except my wedding.\n\nI originally told the girls I don\u2019t care how they do their hair, they don\u2019t have to use my stylist, can do it themselves, even if they don\u2019t do anything special. However, with Aubrey, I feel its  not too much to ask she treats it.\n\nI spoke to my stylist and asked if she knew anyone who could help. She has an associate at her salon that actually specializes in psoriasis on the scalp. She\u2019d be willing to do the treatment on Aubrey\u2019s scalp the day before (giving it time to heal and relax before the wedding).\n\nI spoke with Aubrey and explained the procedure. I said I\u2019d be willing to pay for it. She got super embarrassed and reminded me how much it hurts. I said I understand but that was her doing it. The stylist says she can do it in a way that may hurt a little as it\u2019s removing a decent amount of plaque, but she\u2019ll be gentle. Aubrey told me no, even when I gave her the stylist\u2019s number to talk about it in detail. I tried to be reasonable and said the options were the stylist doing it or Aubrey herself would have to do it. She got really upset and said I\u2019m not a true friend if I can\u2019t accept her as is. She\u2019s now not returning my calls or texts. I feel bad that I hurt her and I\u2019m wondering if this was an unreasonable request?

Dermatologist here- psoriasis is VERY hard on people\u2019s self esteem and sufferers often arrange their life to avoid showing any rash in fear of the kinds of comments you are making. If she had control of the psoriasis, she wouldn\u2019t have it.\n\nPsoriasis treatment can be very irritating to the skin, which it sounds like is happening here. A non-skin specialist treating the scalp may also end up pulling a lot of hair out to get rid of the scale- the scale is often attached tightly to the scalp and hair so the hair comes out when combed vigorously.\n\nIn addition, a good number of patients with psoriasis need tablets or injections to control the psoriasis as the creams aren\u2019t enough. So all the topicals in the world won\u2019t help some people.", "\u201cI told my friend that I wanted her to go through a painful and unnecessary treatment because\u2026 aesthetics, AITA?\u201d\n\nYTA", "YTA- Let me be clear, you're not the asshole for finding out about the stylist and her specialty, then offering it as an option to your friend. \n\nYou're TA for *demanding* that your friend treat *her* condition on *your* terms.", "YTA. \n\nShe already said no to it. The treatments cause her enough pain alone to her without a so-called friend making her feel even more ashamed of it. \n\nThe truth is, nobody is going to look at your wedding pictures with enough of a critical eye to notice or care. You might look at them once in a while, your partner might, but the only photos that matter at a wedding are the ones with the people getting married in them.\n\nAudrey will remember how you made her feel, though. Apologise and hope she\u2019s gracious enough to accept.", "YTA. Did you have all your bridal party sign a contract giving up their bodily autonomy? You are asking her to do something to her body, something that you know HURTS. How would this actually affect your wedding at all?", "YTA for recommending a cosmetology treatment when she\u2019s under the care of a real medical professional. Psoriasis is incredibly painful and usually all the treatment in the world doesn\u2019t resolve it. Additionally, I would *never* as someone to try a new treatment the day before a big event. What is she has an allergic reaction? Your friend is (or maybe was) your friend and you should value who she is as a person, not her less than perfect appearance due to a medical condition she\u2019s actively treating.", "YTA. While you tried to help, it seems you're doing it for selfish reasons. You're being really dismissive even though she's told you the treatment hurts.

YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re a terrible friend and if I was Aubrey that would be the last conversation we ever had. Was this really worth losing a friend over? Hurting her in this way because she didn\u2019t fit the vision for your wedding over something that she can\u2019t help is such an awful way to treat someone. And she\u2019s right, you are no true friend to her", "That is so mean to say she can\u2019t come if she doesn\u2019t have it treated to your liking. :( \nIt\u2019s probably so much for her to deal with already.\nYTA", "YTA.  You made the offer.  She said no.  You can\u2019t pressure her into doing it, especially when there\u2019s no guarantee this stylist *can* work miracles with a case this severe.  And if you\u2019ve invited anyone who would be so rude as to stare or comment on it, your problem should be with *them*, not the person who already feels more self-conscious about this than anyone else.", "YTA you can\u2019t demand someone do something with their hair. My sister tried to pull this shit and I almost didn\u2019t even come to the wedding. When she asked me to be a bridesmaid I had purple hair she assumed I\u2019d go back to \u201cnormal\u201d hair and when it was clear I wasn\u2019t she threw a fit. I was kicked out of the wedding. I now rarely speak to my sister because of all the drama she made about everything.

That was too much of a demand (you didn't really make an \"ask\").  This was a chance to show your quality, and you biffed it. \n\nBut it shouldn't be a friendship ender or wedding participation ender. You need to reaffirm that you love your friend, and her comfort is the most important thing. Apologize and say you lost track of that a bit in the stress, but you want her there and you want her comfortable, and you have her back.", "My mother had significant visible psoriasis, and she talked about people like you. People who refused to even shake her hand or get near her because they thought she was contagious or dirty.\n\nOh, you didn't do *that* to your friend you say? You absolutely fucking did!

You likely won't have this friend for much longer, at least I hope for her sake.  Oh yeah, YTA.", "Yeah YTA\n\nYou are not a friend, when you give her an ultimatum that either the stylist gives her a MEDICAL treatment (without thought to the Doctor who is treating her) or she does it herself. \n\nOr what? She cant be in your wedding? You should be so lucky!\n\nYeah.. did I mention, YTA??", "YTA. I wouldn't worry about how she'll look at your wedding anymore, because I sure as hell wouldn't be going after that", "WOW YTA!  Bridezilla, can you not comprehend that this is a painful and embarrassing medical condition for her? How dare you! You have now amplified her insecurity.  I hope she drops you as a \"friend\" because you obviously don't care about her.", "YTA.

You are basically telling a woman, who has gone through this experience before, how its going to be. You dont know. Its tearing skin off the top of your head. Of course it fucking hurts.\n\n> She got really upset and said I\u2019m not a true friend if I can\u2019t accept her as is. She\u2019s now not returning my calls or texts. \n\nI wouldnt either.

And I love him whatever he looks like. You are shallow and a bridezilla. You don't deserve to call yourself her friend.", "YTA you don\u2019t get to demand people get unnecessary medical treatments for your wedding. She is treating it, leave her alone. To push the issue shows that you don\u2019t actually care about your friends you just care about how people look.", "YTA. Your friend has a medical condition. You intervened and suggested a non-medical treatment (stylists are not medical experts), and she declined. It should not have even gotten that far, but since it did, that should have been the end of it.\n\nThe fact that you care about covering up her medical issue at your wedding is very shallow and your behavior towards her is beyond cruel. You are not being a good friend. I hope she realizes this and pulls out of your wedding so she can be around people that actually care for her.", "YTA. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re continually referring to a symptom of your so-called friend\u2019s medical condition as \u201cbeing unkempt\u201d is vile. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019ve pretty much told her she has no choice but to put herself through immense physical pain - either by herself or at the hands of a stylist - is reprehensible.\n\nNothing about refusing to take \u201cno\u201d as an answer or telling your friend to suck it up and take part in a painful treatment is reasonable. You should have stopped after she declined the first time, but instead you resorted to an ultimatum that *strongly implied* that she needed to do this or else she wouldn\u2019t be included anymore. \n\nShe\u2019s right. You\u2019re not acting like a friend at all.", "YTA. Obviously she would be \"doing\" her hair some kind of style and you said you don't care about that. So this is simply you being upset if she has flakes that might show? Are your other guests so rude that they would be shocked and disgusted by that?\n\nJust kick her off your wedding party if this is how you feel, go full Bridezilla on someone who has a chronic medical condition.", "YTA for overstepping. Even as a friend, you can\u2019t demand someone treat a health issue in a specific way, even if it effects their appearance at an event. \n\nIf you had only suggested the salon and treatment, I think that would have been alright but the way you pressured her after she said no was not.", "What is with brides these days?", "Well, Aubrey called it.\n\nYou\u2019re not a true friend. In fact anyone more concerned about a few photos than the very real discomfort a friend suffers from a medical condition is no friend at all.\n\nYTA. Hope Aubrey has the good sense to ditch you and your wedding.", "As someone who also struggles with scalp psoriasis, you are a massive AH.

I understand you want your wedding to be perfect, however is aesthetics more important than your friends feelings?\n\nShe has told you it hurts, you even stated the hairdresser would do it before to give her time to HEAL. Healing usually suggests some pain would be involved.\n\nI have seen you use thick curly hair as a comparison. It is not the same, your friend has a medical condition.\n\nShe is going through her life in pain, having to get specialised shampoos, not wear certain clothes and covering her head often. She most likely has had to deal with rude or nasty comments. Show some compassion", "Yeah, you started off fine, but ventured into AH territory pretty quickly. It was not unreasonable to try and help your friend feel and look better by giving her info on a stylist that could help, but it is not cool to try and force a medical treatment on your friend, especially a painful one. She is suffering enough and has enough embarrassment surrounding her condition. I think you should tell her that you are sorry and that you were wrong and hope she forgives you.", "See, you could have just offered to be there for her and give her the contact of the stylist and convince her to try it out and see if it hurts that much. But what you did sounds like you value her looks on your wedding more than her. And for that YTA.", "YTA - what is more important to you, your perfect little image of what your wedding day will be or your friendship and the feelings of a close friend?  Try and have a little compassion.\n\nAlso - take some advice...it should be about the marriage not the wedding.

Hope that this was worth throwing your entire friendship away for.", "YTA (You're the Asshole) for asking your friend to get a psoriasis scalp treatment for your wedding. It's understandable that you want your friend to look her best for your wedding, but it's not fair to put pressure on her to get a treatment that she is uncomfortable with and that may cause her pain. It's important to be understanding and accepting of your friend's condition and to not make her feel self-conscious or embarrassed about it. It's not your place to dictate how she should manage her psoriasis or to pressure her into getting a treatment that she is not comfortable with. You should apologize to your friend for making her feel uncomfortable and for not being understanding and supportive.", "I don't care if I'm going to get down voted to hell but NAH. You didn't demand you asked her, offered to pay for it professionally done. That doesn't make you an asshole. Also, being honest that the pictures will show it and it's not a look you want on your wedding and it can't be edited. Which is odd because they can pretty much edit anything these days.\n\nYour friend is insistent she doesn't want it done and is clearly embarrassed by it therefore is avoiding you which is understandable as well. Doesn't make her an asshole. \n\nSo now Op you are at a stalemate. You can either let it be and have her in your wedding or not. Perhaps a hat? Flowers in her hair? \n\nTread lightly because if you truly care about this friendship you'll be gentle with her feelings.", "YTA and a dumpster fire of one at that. You're actually thinking any of this is ok? You're asking your friend to do something that is uncomfortable physically and she finds upsetting emotionally. For your pictures.", "Wow you a terrible friend. She has a health problem and you don\u2019t care when she tells you it hurts her and you already know it is a problem for her. So you essentially say suck it up I don\u2019t care. As other people have commented bridezilla and don\u2019t be surprised I don\u2019t she will be returning your calls ever!!", "YTA. You should probably think a bit harder about what the word 'friend' means to you.", "YTA.\n\nYOU ARE ASKING HER TO PUT HERSELF THROUGH PHYSICAL PAIN TO MAKE PICTURES MARGINALLY NICER.\n\nYou wouldn't ask someone in a wheelchair to STAND for pictures so they'd look nicer knowing it would cause them a great deal of pain or to take painkillers with horrible side effects for them so they can.\n\nBut you consider it fine asking her to sacrifice for you because it is a skin condition and it is 'technically' a treatment... a treatment that gives her great pain to the point she doesn't regularly want to do it. And you are acting like paying for it would be a kindness, like sorry, no, it isn't a kindness to ask your friend to *hurt herself* because it will make your pictures nicer to you.\n\nWhile your actions also tell her that she should be self-conscious of her condition by pushing her to specifically treat it over other options she would likely find a lot more comfortable, like have you considered hair accessories and helping her brush out her hair, you know, things she may be significantly more comfortable with? \n\nOr you know, a hat? There are bridesmaids hats that would both hide a lot of her hair and likely be something she is far more comfortable doing since you already know she tends to wear hats to hide it to begin with. Have all your bridesmaids wear them so she doesn't stand out and it doesn't feel targeted at her.\n\nYou owe her a major apology first though for not only feeding into her insecurity but being actively cruel by ever suggesting she do something painful for you for some pictures that no one else on the planet except for you will likely ever care this deeply about.

You just said it badly and really don\u2019t get how painful, humiliating and how badly people get treated by society. Even with a diagnosed immune issue for 15 years I still have medical professionals telling me I just don\u2019t wash enough and it\u2019s because I\u2019m overweight. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine how it feels to be told her friend wants her to suffer and actually judges her. Perhaps talk to her, asking her if she is willing to do one treatment now and one the day before would help. She may be afraid of being in pain for days after. \n\nAlternatively, maybe let the bridesmaids wear hats\u2026 and make sure the photographer does some pictures of her and edits out any flakes\u2026 it might help her with confidence. \n\nAlso her dr may want to look into Humaria. Helped me & may help her.", "YTA\n\nAren't you just the champion of vanity and superficiality.

The catering walk-in?", "YTA, she should drop you as a friend, simple.", "YTA", "INFO:  Are you willing to cover the cost of treatment if you're asking she have it done specifically for your wedding?  \nYour friend has expressed that the treatment hurts and you don't know what her pain tolerance is. This could be immense pain for her to do for one day for your wedding. You're being a bad friend here. I get that it's your wedding, but you asked her to be a bridesmaid knowing that she had this condition and knowing how it sometimes affects her. What's more important to you here?

You are not being a true friend because you can't accept her how she is. Psoriasis is extremely painful. Stress is a nasty trigger and makes it worse.

They are so powerful that I cannot have them until I'm fully vaccinated for COVID-19 for otherwise if I catch COVID-19 unvaccinated I would easily die for I will not be able to fight it off. And I cannot have Vaccinations until 2 to 4 weeks atfer or before the shots. The drugs used to that this type of conditions also is mild level chemo literally.

A girl we talked to, who was pretty nice when we talked, asked him (when I went to the bar and came back I heard the rest of it) why he was with me on this party, when he could have way more fun without me. He asked her why he would have more fun without me. She sad because his skin makes him ugly and that would scare people. He asked why my skin would be ugly.

Times where hard, but I'm happy about every moment\". \n\nThis made me stronger in my ways and decisions. \nIt took me 18 years to be plaque free.

Your friend is already self-conscious about her condition, and you unintentionally made it worse. It's possible that by March the psoriasis on her scalp will have cleared up almost fully, if not completely.
