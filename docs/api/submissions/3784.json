My friend \u201cAubrey\u201d is a bridesmaid. Aubrey has heavy psoriasis and is self conscious about it. She\u2019s wearing a long sleeved dress in the wedding, by her own request. At the time, the only visible places were her arms and legs.\n\nIn recent months, it\u2019s developed on her scalp. She\u2019s had to buy a special shampoo so the patches and flakes don\u2019t show in her hair. Once again, she\u2019s super self conscious. According to her, doing the treatment herself really hurts and makes her feel worse about herself. Her dermatologist prescribed a special shampoo and conditioner that\u2019s supposed to help loosen it so she can brush and comb it out. She does what she can do it doesn\u2019t look too bad, but sometimes she just gives up and the flakes show. They\u2019re big, plaque-like flakes that pop up on her scalp. She wears a lot of hats or hoodies.\n\nThe thing is, I wouldn\u2019t have minded her wearing a short sleeve dress and showing her flakes/plaque on her arms and legs as it\u2019s really not an issue. However, because you can\u2019t see the redness, just the flakes, her hair looks unkempt often. It\u2019s her hair, so I don\u2019t care on every other day\u2026.except my wedding.\n\nI originally told the girls I don\u2019t care how they do their hair, they don\u2019t have to use my stylist, can do it themselves, even if they don\u2019t do anything special. However, with Aubrey, I feel its  not too much to ask she treats it.\n\nI spoke to my stylist and asked if she knew anyone who could help. She has an associate at her salon that actually specializes in psoriasis on the scalp. She\u2019d be willing to do the treatment on Aubrey\u2019s scalp the day before (giving it time to heal and relax before the wedding).\n\nI spoke with Aubrey and explained the procedure. I said I\u2019d be willing to pay for it. She got super embarrassed and reminded me how much it hurts. I said I understand but that was her doing it. The stylist says she can do it in a way that may hurt a little as it\u2019s removing a decent amount of plaque, but she\u2019ll be gentle. Aubrey told me no, even when I gave her the stylist\u2019s number to talk about it in detail. I tried to be reasonable and said the options were the stylist doing it or Aubrey herself would have to do it. She got really upset and said I\u2019m not a true friend if I can\u2019t accept her as is. She\u2019s now not returning my calls or texts. I feel bad that I hurt her and I\u2019m wondering if this was an unreasonable request?

Dermatologist here- psoriasis is VERY hard on people\u2019s self esteem and sufferers often arrange their life to avoid showing any rash in fear of the kinds of comments you are making. If she had control of the psoriasis, she wouldn\u2019t have it.\n\nPsoriasis treatment can be very irritating to the skin, which it sounds like is happening here. A non-skin specialist treating the scalp may also end up pulling a lot of hair out to get rid of the scale- the scale is often attached tightly to the scalp and hair so the hair comes out when combed vigorously.\n\nIn addition, a good number of patients with psoriasis need tablets or injections to control the psoriasis as the creams aren\u2019t enough. So all the topicals in the world won\u2019t help some people.", "\u201cI told my friend that I wanted her to go through a painful and unnecessary treatment because\u2026 aesthetics, AITA?\u201d\n\nYTA", "YTA- Let me be clear, you're not the asshole for finding out about the stylist and her specialty, then offering it as an option to your friend. \n\nYou're TA for *demanding* that your friend treat *her* condition on *your* terms.", "YTA. \n\nShe already said no to it. The treatments cause her enough pain alone to her without a so-called friend making her feel even more ashamed of it. \n\nThe truth is, nobody is going to look at your wedding pictures with enough of a critical eye to notice or care. You might look at them once in a while, your partner might, but the only photos that matter at a wedding are the ones with the people getting married in them.\n\nAudrey will remember how you made her feel, though. Apologise and hope she\u2019s gracious enough to accept.", "YTA. Did you have all your bridal party sign a contract giving up their bodily autonomy? You are asking her to do something to her body, something that you know HURTS. How would this actually affect your wedding at all?", "YTA for recommending a cosmetology treatment when she\u2019s under the care of a real medical professional. Psoriasis is incredibly painful and usually all the treatment in the world doesn\u2019t resolve it. Additionally, I would *never* as someone to try a new treatment the day before a big event. What is she has an allergic reaction? Your friend is (or maybe was) your friend and you should value who she is as a person, not her less than perfect appearance due to a medical condition she\u2019s actively treating.", "YTA. While you tried to help, it seems you're doing it for selfish reasons. You're being really dismissive even though she's told you the treatment hurts.

YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re a terrible friend and if I was Aubrey that would be the last conversation we ever had. Was this really worth losing a friend over? Hurting her in this way because she didn\u2019t fit the vision for your wedding over something that she can\u2019t help is such an awful way to treat someone. And she\u2019s right, you are no true friend to her", "That is so mean to say she can\u2019t come if she doesn\u2019t have it treated to your liking. :( \nIt\u2019s probably so much for her to deal with already.\nYTA", "YTA.  You made the offer.  She said no.  You can\u2019t pressure her into doing it, especially when there\u2019s no guarantee this stylist *can* work miracles with a case this severe.  And if you\u2019ve invited anyone who would be so rude as to stare or comment on it, your problem should be with *them*, not the person who already feels more self-conscious about this than anyone else.", "YTA you can\u2019t demand someone do something with their hair. My sister tried to pull this shit and I almost didn\u2019t even come to the wedding. When she asked me to be a bridesmaid I had purple hair she assumed I\u2019d go back to \u201cnormal\u201d hair and when it was clear I wasn\u2019t she threw a fit. I was kicked out of the wedding.

That was too much of a demand (you didn't really make an \"ask\").  This was a chance to show your quality, and you biffed it. \n\nBut it shouldn't be a friendship ender or wedding participation ender. You need to reaffirm that you love your friend, and her comfort is the most important thing. Apologize and say you lost track of that a bit in the stress, but you want her there and you want her comfortable, and you have her back.", "My mother had significant visible psoriasis, and she talked about people like you. People who refused to even shake her hand or get near her because they thought she was contagious or dirty.\n\nOh, you didn't do *that* to your friend you say? You absolutely fucking did!

You likely won't have this friend for much longer, at least I hope for her sake.  Oh yeah, YTA.", "Yeah YTA\n\nYou are not a friend, when you give her an ultimatum that either the stylist gives her a MEDICAL treatment (without thought to the Doctor who is treating her) or she does it herself. \n\nOr what? She cant be in your wedding? You should be so lucky!\n\nYeah.. did I mention, YTA??", "YTA. I wouldn't worry about how she'll look at your wedding anymore, because I sure as hell wouldn't be going after that", "WOW YTA!  Bridezilla, can you not comprehend that this is a painful and embarrassing medical condition for her? How dare you! You have now amplified her insecurity.  I hope she drops you as a \"friend\" because you obviously don't care about her.", "YTA.

You are basically telling a woman, who has gone through this experience before, how its going to be. You dont know. Its tearing skin off the top of your head. Of course it fucking hurts.\n\n> She got really upset and said I\u2019m not a true friend if I can\u2019t accept her as is. She\u2019s now not returning my calls or texts. \n\nI wouldnt either.

And I love him whatever he looks like. You are shallow and a bridezilla. You don't deserve to call yourself her friend.", "YTA you don\u2019t get to demand people get unnecessary medical treatments for your wedding. She is treating it, leave her alone. To push the issue shows that you don\u2019t actually care about your friends you just care about how people look.", "YTA. Your friend has a medical condition. You intervened and suggested a non-medical treatment (stylists are not medical experts), and she declined. It should not have even gotten that far, but since it did, that should have been the end of it.\n\nThe fact that you care about covering up her medical issue at your wedding is very shallow and your behavior towards her is beyond cruel. You are not being a good friend. I hope she realizes this and pulls out of your wedding so she can be around people that actually care for her.", "YTA. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re continually referring to a symptom of your so-called friend\u2019s medical condition as \u201cbeing unkempt\u201d is vile. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019ve pretty much told her she has no choice but to put herself through immense physical pain - either by herself or at the hands of a stylist - is reprehensible.\n\nNothing about refusing to take \u201cno\u201d as an answer or telling your friend to suck it up and take part in a painful treatment is reasonable. You should have stopped after she declined the first time, but instead you resorted to an ultimatum that *strongly implied* that she needed to do this or else she wouldn\u2019t be included anymore. \n\nShe\u2019s right. You\u2019re not acting like a friend at all.", "YTA. Obviously she would be \"doing\" her hair some kind of style and you said you don't care about that. So this is simply you being upset if she has flakes that might show? Are your other guests so rude that they would be shocked and disgusted by that?\n\nJust kick her off your wedding party if this is how you feel, go full Bridezilla on someone who has a chronic medical condition.", "YTA for overstepping. Even as a friend, you can\u2019t demand someone treat a health issue in a specific way, even if it effects their appearance at an event. \n\nIf you had only suggested the salon and treatment, I think that would have been alright but the way you pressured her after she said no was not.", "What is with brides these days?", "Well, Aubrey called it.\n\nYou\u2019re not a true friend. In fact anyone more concerned about a few photos than the very real discomfort a friend suffers from a medical condition is no friend at all.\n\nYTA. Hope Aubrey has the good sense to ditch you and your wedding.", "As someone who also struggles with scalp psoriasis, you are a massive AH.

I understand you want your wedding to be perfect, however is aesthetics more important than your friends feelings?\n\nShe has told you it hurts, you even stated the hairdresser would do it before to give her time to HEAL. Healing usually suggests some pain would be involved.\n\nI have seen you use thick curly hair as a comparison. It is not the same, your friend has a medical condition.\n\nShe is going through her life in pain, having to get specialised shampoos, not wear certain clothes and covering her head often. She most likely has had to deal with rude or nasty comments. Show some compassion", "Yeah, you started off fine, but ventured into AH territory pretty quickly. It was not unreasonable to try and help your friend feel and look better by giving her info on a stylist that could help, but it is not cool to try and force a medical treatment on your friend, especially a painful one. She is suffering enough and has enough embarrassment surrounding her condition. I think you should tell her that you are sorry and that you were wrong and hope she forgives you.", "See, you could have just offered to be there for her and give her the contact of the stylist and convince her to try it out and see if it hurts that much. But what you did sounds like you value her looks on your wedding more than her. And for that YTA.", "YTA - what is more important to you, your perfect little image of what your wedding day will be or your friendship and the feelings of a close friend?  Try and have a little compassion.\n\nAlso - take some advice...it should be about the marriage not the wedding.

Hope that this was worth throwing your entire friendship away for.", "YTA (You're the Asshole) for asking your friend to get a psoriasis scalp treatment for your wedding. It's understandable that you want your friend to look her best for your wedding, but it's not fair to put pressure on her to get a treatment that she is uncomfortable with and that may cause her pain. It's important to be understanding and accepting of your friend's condition and to not make her feel self-conscious or embarrassed about it. It's not your place to dictate how she should manage her psoriasis or to pressure her into getting a treatment that she is not comfortable with. You should apologize to your friend for making her feel uncomfortable and for not being understanding and supportive.", "I don't care if I'm going to get down voted to hell but NAH. You didn't demand you asked her, offered to pay for it professionally done. That doesn't make you an asshole. Also, being honest that the pictures will show it and it's not a look you want on your wedding and it can't be edited. Which is odd because they can pretty much edit anything these days.\n\nYour friend is insistent she doesn't want it done and is clearly embarrassed by it therefore is avoiding you which is understandable as well. Doesn't make her an asshole. \n\nSo now Op you are at a stalemate. You can either let it be and have her in your wedding or not. Perhaps a hat? Flowers in her hair? \n\nTread lightly because if you truly care about this friendship you'll be gentle with her feelings.", "YTA and a dumpster fire of one at that. You're actually thinking any of this is ok? You're asking your friend to do something that is uncomfortable physically and she finds upsetting emotionally. For your pictures.", "Wow you a terrible friend. She has a health problem and you don\u2019t care when she tells you it hurts her and you already know it is a problem for her. So you essentially say suck it up I don\u2019t care. As other people have commented bridezilla and don\u2019t be surprised I don\u2019t she will be returning your calls ever!!", "YTA. You should probably think a bit harder about what the word 'friend' means to you.", "YTA.\n\nYOU ARE ASKING HER TO PUT HERSELF THROUGH PHYSICAL PAIN TO MAKE PICTURES MARGINALLY NICER.\n\nYou wouldn't ask someone in a wheelchair to STAND for pictures so they'd look nicer knowing it would cause them a great deal of pain or to take painkillers with horrible side effects for them so they can.\n\nBut you consider it fine asking her to sacrifice for you because it is a skin condition and it is 'technically' a treatment... a treatment that gives her great pain to the point she doesn't regularly want to do it. And you are acting like paying for it would be a kindness, like sorry, no, it isn't a kindness to ask your friend to *hurt herself* because it will make your pictures nicer to you.\n\nWhile your actions also tell her that she should be self-conscious of her condition by pushing her to specifically treat it over other options she would likely find a lot more comfortable, like have you considered hair accessories and helping her brush out her hair, you know, things she may be significantly more comfortable with? \n\nOr you know, a hat? There are bridesmaids hats that would both hide a lot of her hair and likely be something she is far more comfortable doing since you already know she tends to wear hats to hide it to begin with. Have all your bridesmaids wear them so she doesn't stand out and it doesn't feel targeted at her.\n\nYou owe her a major apology first though for not only feeding into her insecurity but being actively cruel by ever suggesting she do something painful for you for some pictures that no one else on the planet except for you will likely ever care this deeply about.

You just said it badly and really don\u2019t get how painful, humiliating and how badly people get treated by society. Even with a diagnosed immune issue for 15 years I still have medical professionals telling me I just don\u2019t wash enough and it\u2019s because I\u2019m overweight. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine how it feels to be told her friend wants her to suffer and actually judges her. Perhaps talk to her, asking her if she is willing to do one treatment now and one the day before would help. She may be afraid of being in pain for days after. \n\nAlternatively, maybe let the bridesmaids wear hats\u2026 and make sure the photographer does some pictures of her and edits out any flakes\u2026 it might help her with confidence. \n\nAlso her dr may want to look into Humaria. Helped me & may help her.", "YTA\n\nAren't you just the champion of vanity and superficiality.

The catering walk-in?", "YTA, she should drop you as a friend, simple.", "YTA", "INFO:  Are you willing to cover the cost of treatment if you're asking she have it done specifically for your wedding?  \nYour friend has expressed that the treatment hurts and you don't know what her pain tolerance is. This could be immense pain for her to do for one day for your wedding. You're being a bad friend here. I get that it's your wedding, but you asked her to be a bridesmaid knowing that she had this condition and knowing how it sometimes affects her. What's more important to you here?

You are not being a true friend because you can't accept her how she is. Psoriasis is extremely painful. Stress is a nasty trigger and makes it worse.

I don't know about her; but I have mine every 3 months and I will never permit unknown persons touch me or mess around with my skin for those previously mentioned injections puts me at risk of infections if not careful. They are so powerful that I cannot have them until I'm fully vaccinated for COVID-19 for otherwise if I catch COVID-19 unvaccinated I would easily die for I will not be able to fight it off. And I cannot have Vaccinations until 2 to 4 weeks atfer or before the shots. The drugs used to that this type of conditions also is mild level chemo literally.  You are asking your friend to risk her own health for your wedding which is absolutely not worth her risk.  The salons are very dirty places and she would be having actual open Wounds from plaque removals and she already is immunocomprised af. So you are YTA and a horrible friend. You owe her a major apology", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA. Your friend has a medical condition. How she chooses to treat it is between her and her doctor. Other people don\u2019t have a say in her medical choices.", "YTA.  You should have never attempted forcing your friend to undergo hurtful treatment just so everything looks perfect at your wedding.  You didn't suggest this in the past to help her.  You just wanted to help yourself.", "YTA Dude unless you have Psoriasis you have NO IDEA what they deal with on a daily basis for YEARS. I\u2019ll tell you right now that I bet she wishes she didn\u2019t have this issue either, I would know because I\u2019ve lived with Psoriasis since I was 12 and I\u2019m now 25. Psoriasis is constantly itchy and many times is painful especially to treat. Some treatments even cause worse issues long down the line (Humira caused pretty bad issues with me where I was hospitalized) so I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, you have no right trying to force her to get treatment. You are a shitty friend and someone\u2019s skin condition unless it\u2019s fucking leprosy isn\u2019t gonna cause any problems on your wedding day. If you\u2019re worried about pictures that\u2019s what editing is for. I\u2019m not sorry for what I said, do better!", "YTA and I just needed to read the headline.", "YTA you want your friend to have mecial treatment that she finds painful, so you can have the perfect wedding picture. Absolutely disgusting behaviour on your part. Bridzilla. You are not that girls friend. You are putting pictures about your friends pain.", "NTA - I got you, sister.  \n\n\nYou have been reasonable. You have offered solutions, offered to pay for those solutions and done everything you can to ease her mind. You let her choose her style of dress, even though it will call much more attention to her issue.\n\nAt this point, it's her decision whether she wants to be in the wedding. Bad hair is not a protected class. Aubrey needs to figure it out and accept solutions people present her.", "NAH, is it possible to find some sort of dressy headpiece or hat to match her bridesmaod dress that could help cover her hair?  That way the flakes are not as noticeable and she doesn't have to go through the discomfort", "She needs Cosentyx", "NAH but time to let it go. You won\u2019t be able to see it in the pictures and you won\u2019t remember it later. Just love her as she is and ask her to forgive you. Your friendship should be more important than your vanity. If it\u2019s not then she shouldn\u2019t be a bridesmaid", "Would you ask a friend who has chronic acne to go to a dermatologist to get their zits popped before your wedding? yta\n\nyour friend is self conscious, psoriasis is hard to control and the treatments often don't work. In addition, like 90% of people are not gonna get whigged out by someone having dandruff, even bad dandruff. Most adults know it isn't super easy to control that shit.\n\nEdit: What the hell do you think plaque is, cuz custy mouth goo is the last thing I would compare skin flakes to.", "Thank you for explaining that so well.", "I had bad psoriasis in high school and was basically told never to remove the scales or pick at it at all.. painfully removing the plaques sounds like it would just create more inflammation and for it to spread even more? Mine has been in remission for several years so I\u2019m lucky but it was a hard thing to go through at the time", "How do you feel about coal tar? It works wonders for me, better than any prescription. Yeah I smell like a newly paved road, but a week of it topically and it clears up everything. I never hear about from Derms, and found out about by accident.", "Also, to try it for the first time the day before the wedding.\n\nI have psoriasis. It's well-controlled, but there is no chance in hell I'd try a new treatment the day before an important event with photos. It's unpredictable. For me it's especially problematic in the winter - it's not clear where the OP is but winter can be particularly rough for psoriasis.", "And that's all that needs to be said!", "I normally don\u2019t care about what people look like. It\u2019s why I said if she wore a short sleeved dress, I wouldn\u2019t care. However, the hair in pictures isn\u2019t going to look nice. And the photographer said it\u2019s not something she can fix in editing.", "I didn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t come! I said those were the options I felt appropriate.", "To me, that\u2019s a big difference. Purple hair isn\u2019t unkempt.", "This, so much. My mom had it too, and I could care the eff less. But I knew it hurt her when other people reacted.", "Respectfully disagree about the NAH because OP knows the procedure is painful but still asked her friend to do it for.... what? OP's wedding pics? Those can absolutely be edited. I don't think OP wants to pay to edit them.", "I would have agreed up until the point where OP said they told their friend \u201ceither the stylist does it or you have to do it\u201d \nThat sounds like a demand", ">you seem to be pretty considerate\n\nWhere? She brought up an insecurity and called her friend unkempt. Is trying to force her to do something that'll probably be painful and didn't take into consideration any previous plans the friend might have made. Like it makes less sense since the bridesmaids don't even have a set style maybe the friend already has a plan etc. \n\nAnd the *kicker* is there's no guarantee it'll work. Everyone's skin is different and the same treatment can have different results for difficult skin and it may make it worse and the skin even more irritated. The friend has obviously tried more than one thing in the past. Trying something new hours before the wedding is a terrible idea!!!\n\n\nYTA op in how you went about it and trying to force treatment as a condition of being in the wedding.", "How is it considerate to make her friend go through a treatment that, even really gently done by a stylist, is STILL painful?", "Yeah, I was thinking that it would be possible to get a hat or nice headscarf that goes with the bridesmaid's dress. My SIL's MOH had 4C hair. She had a relaxer done right before the wedding and it severely damaged her hair. She ended up finding a nice silk scarf that complimented her dress and wearing a headscarf.", "That's what I was going to suggest. My dad had psoriasis that was so bad, my entire life. There was a patch on his back that was his entire back. It extended from his neck to his pant line, and across from side to side. Myself and my siblings would take turns every night putting moisturizer on him so he didn't bleed as much - he went through a 2L bottle of moisturizer every week or so. That's not counting the patches on his elbows, knees, legs, etc. He lived in misery for as long as I can remember. \n\nThe doctor put him on Humira and methotrexate, in 6 months he had zero patches.", "OP says in the first line of the last paragraph that she'd be willing to pay for the procedure.", "\u00ab\u00a0Bad hair\u00a0\u00bb it\u2019s a disorder!!", "Taltz is the one that finally worked for me.", "Okay? And you consider that something that's going to significantly affect the wedding somehow? What do you care what other people look like in pictures?", "I'm not sure why it would be impossible to fix with editing. The worst case scenario is a bit of scalp peeling, stuck in her hair, right? I could remove that with 2 clicks using the standard camera app on my phone. But maybe I'm missing something?", "> I normally don't care what people look like\n\n\n> The hair in pictures isn't going to look nice\n\n\nWhich one is it? Because these are conflicting statements.", "Can\u2019t you just find a hat that works with her dress/your wedding look? Well, assuming she ever speaks to you again. YTA for insisting she handle something she is sensitive about your way. Offering to pay and suggesting was maybe ok, but pushing for it was not cool", "You are vile and YTA", "Why won\u2019t it look nice. You have no idea how she was planning on deal with the situation. You just made assumptions because you think everyone should jump through hoops to accommodate you. Hopefully she back out of the wedding and ends the friendship. You need to reprioritize what is important.", "Is she your friend or an accessory to your wedding? YTA and don\u2019t be surprised when she doesn\u2019t show up.", "\u201cI normally don\u2019t care\u201d means you do care here. With friends like you who needs enemies. Yeeessh this is gross.", "So what! She will actually have open wounds. What makes literal open wounds better than the plaques??? You're actually asking her to rip her skin open for your stupid wedding! It's better to be a friend and be accommodating for she cannot help her skin", "You told her that either the stylist will do it or she would have to do it herself. It seems implied that she has to have it done in order to attend?", "Soft YTA, OP. I get you were trying to help but a quick google search will tell you how emotionally and physically distressing psoriasis can be. I know you want everything to perfect but you shouldn't have put aesthetics above your own friend's emotional well being. You want her to go through a physically and possibly emotionally painful procedure, or she can't come? Yeah, YTA. It's very unfair on her and I wouldn't be surprised if this forever stains your relationship, and understandably so.", "OP you are not a good or true friend. How dare you ask any person to do a painful treatment so that their hair looks nice on your wedding pictures. I would go to nc with you.YTA", "To me, calling a painful medical condition \"unkempt\" is rude as hell. \n\nYou know this causes her physical and emotional pain, and you asked her to experience MORE physical and emotional pain so your pictures are nicer? Be a better friend, call and appologize NOW.", "Here, let\u2019s try inserting some of these instead to see if you get it?.\n\n\u201cCould you just like\u2026 not have a port-wine stain birthmark for a day, cause ya know, it\u2019s my wedding day?\u201d \u201cNo?

But I insist\u201d\n\n\u201cCould you maybe chop off your toes for my wedding?

But I insist\u201d", "Jesus. What is wrong with you?! Your friend's hair isn't UNKEMPT either. She has a MEDICAL CONDITION. What you're seeing is the side effect of her PAINFUL MEDICAL CONDITION. That's not dirty or \"unkempt\", and you keep referring to \"treatments\" as though by using neutral language you can make this harmless and benign, but you have admitted to being fully aware that what you're asking her to do is a PAINFUL AND NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY procedure which involves the actual sloughing of not-entirely-dead skin cells and scabbing from her very tender and already-sore scalp.\n\nI'm really sorry (no, I'm not, even a little bit) that you're upset because you know some judgy, awful people (oh look, it seems you're amongst them) who might look at the side effects of your friend's PAINFUL MEDICAL CONDITION and mistakenly assume that they are dandruff or that her hair is \"unkempt\", but the fact that you are putting aesthetic worries above her actual health and keeping her as pain-free as possible during a difficult and humiliating flare-up of an actual ongoing chronic condition just speaks volumes about you. \n\nYou are not her friend, but YTA, most certainly.", "YTA and i seriously hope you're realizing what a bride-zilla this makes you , if she was missing teeth would be demanding dentures? How about a leg ? Better get a prosthetic or a long dress? She obviously cant help it.", "I've been on Taltz injector pen for a few years, no more patches.  Prior to the medication, the scalp plaques were the worst.", "Thank you, I missed that the first time around.", "Fine,  then Aubrey can go wallow in her self-pity somewhere else and not destroy her friend's wedding.", "I sort of attributed it to someone wearing jeans and a dirty t shirt to the wedding. Will it really matter in 50 years? Of course not! But at the same time, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a big ask for one day. Was it shallow to also ask she wear a dress or pantsuit? Or is it just because it\u2019s not something she doesn\u2019t want to do? I\u2019m genuinely asking, no snark!", "Right?

If so, we can add insensitive and oblivious to YTA", "Wearing a dress or pantsuit doesn\u2019t cause physical pain.", "This isn't hygiene. It's a medical condition. And it's a painful treatment.\n\nAnd unless you plan on getting those photos blown up into massive posters, no one person is going to be big enough to spot that sort of detail, anyway.", "Those are completely different things! This isn't about her style not being formal enough, something that is a choice and very easily fixable. This is about her MEDICAL CONDITION, which she is already very self-conscious of. Does wearing a dress or a pantsuit cause a person physical pain?", "Eww, you did not just compare her completely involuntary, very painful medical condition to someone who chooses to wear dirty clothes to an event! \n\nDid you really type that out, read it back to yourself and still think it was okay? \n\nHonestly, I hope this poor girl drops out of the wedding and drops you as a friend.\n\nAs someone with Psoriasis, I can tell you it is a painful, embarrassing and frustrating condition. To have your skin be so itchy and dry that it literally cracks and bleeds, no matter what you do to maintain it, is so painful and so frustrating.
