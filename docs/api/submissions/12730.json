I'm only there once or twice a week sometimes ever other week it's a bit sporadic. I was informed that \"it's his house, he pays rent\" it wouldn't be right to ask him to put pants or shorts on.

There have been no demands made what so ever. I'm not a demanding person, I simply discussed my feelings with my partner.\n\nAddition: For those asking how would I feel if I was told what I could wear in my home.

Boobs are not the same as a penis. Something similar would be a woman wearing flowy shorts with no underwear and sitting cross cross applesauce and exposing her vulva which would not be appropriate either.\n\nFrankly, I find it disgusting when people make a comparison like you did. That kind of thinking is why babies have had to eat in bathrooms or completely covered in the US until recently.", "Comparing boobs and a penis isn\u2019t close to equivalent.", "First of all, the woman would have to be falling out of the top braless to fit the female version of OPs description.

Of course women sexualize men. 85% of Bridgerton springs to mind. However, there isn\u2019t anything to sexualize about a flaccid penis and hairy balls falling out of a man\u2019s underwear.

That shit isn't good when it's from random people, obviously, but my gf doesn't gargle my balls out of pure altruism. I don't even ask her to.

Okay peek-a-boos happen. Boxer-briefs? Those are briefs but longer. Those are bicycle shorts with less spandex.

Both can be right.", "eh, I think there's a difference between \"okay\" and \"polite\". one could argue that it's \"okay\" if she didn't ask you because it's your living space and it's not inherently wrong, however, it is generally considered good etiquette to be presentable when there are guests in your home. so in other words, technically you could say it's okay, but it would be more appropriate not to be in your underwear when company is over.", "As a woman who has spoken to many other women about the subject, I\u2019m going to assume my feelings and theirs are accurate, but thank you for your mansplaination.", "Yeah, fuck this guy.
