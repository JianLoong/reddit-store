I'm only there once or twice a week sometimes ever other week it's a bit sporadic. I was informed that \"it's his house, he pays rent\" it wouldn't be right to ask him to put pants or shorts on.

There have been no demands made what so ever. I'm not a demanding person, I simply discussed my feelings with my partner.\n\nAddition: For those asking how would I feel if I was told what I could wear in my home. I also have roommates, I respect them and myself enough to not walk unclothed through the house.
