{"id": 6491, "submission_id": "1038xpz", "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend that I don't wanna buy a house when I already have one", "selftext": "Okay so for some context my father bought a house on January 1st, 1978. The house was built in 1957 so it's been around for a while and isn't up to code. In 1997 the ceiling caved in and my dad not able to fix it at the time decided to move out. My dad just recently told me he wanted me to have it due to him being up there in age and not having the ability to fix it (my dad being 71 me being 21 and more capable to fix it) I just found a stable job and bring in most of the money so I don't mind being the one to fix it. My dad got me power tools for Christmas and as of January 1st 2023 I am now the owner of the property (my dad wanted the date to be ironic so that's why he waited so long). I recently pitched the idea of fixing the house up to my boyfriend and his family as they worry about our finances. And they told me it is just a lost cause. Granted my dad is a car collector and most of his collection is on the property so I can see why some people wouldn't like the idea but I don't mind the cars and I can easily move them over to the lot next door (which my dad still owns). They also told me it would just be a money pit and I had no idea what I was getting into. I've been working on houses since I was 5 years old and I know how to redo the roof due to being taught at a very young age. In all I'm looking at a $10,000 - $15,000 project that's only if I wanted to add an expansion that has already been started. My boyfriend and I went over to his parents house as they wanted to speak with me and they told me that they cleaned off a section of their property to bring a mobile home in. My boyfriend had gone with them and picked out at home for $150,000 and we're planning on having it moved to their property for me and him to live in. They told us we could have their land and all we would have to do is pay off the house. I told them absolutely not due to me already owning my home and land and that I didn't want to get into any debt of any kind. My boyfriend and his parents told me that a house that didn't need to be worked on would be better as I would not need to be BURDENED with my father's misfortunes. I told them that I would continue with fixing up my house and that if my boyfriend wanted to live with his parents that's on him. Am I the a-hole?\n\n\nEdit: I went ahead and changed all my banking information so my bfs folks no longer have my info. And to add to this most of the plumbing has been replaced half of the roof is done and I have enough supplies to finish the other half. My father has offered to support me financially in this build the house is a 15ft x 30ft but will be getting a extra 18ft expansion along with a basement (which will be built first then expansion over top) and the enclosed front porch will be finished here in a couple months. I have gone inside and there is little mold to be seen and not much water damage as a tarp has covered the roof since the cave in (tarp has been replaced often) house is made of brick and concrete and no visible cracking in the foundation. I will be building kitchen cabinets and other things that can and will be moved in and attached later in the meantime since it is too cold to be outside. Also hole for the basement has already been excavated. I will probably start construction up again in March unless it starts getting warmer sooner. Also I have drawn up blue prints and have made 3d models for reference so I have everything planned out.", "created_utc": 1672852291, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1038xpz/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_i_dont_wanna/", "score": 466, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019d keep finances separate", "NTA.  That said, pay a home inspector to evaluate your house to see what repairs would cost and if it\u2019s actually financially practical.

Are you and boyfriend planning on getting married/sharing a long term future?", "NTA.\n\nBF and family are being pushy and demanding expecting you to take on a huge debt.\n\nMy only concern with your dad's house is if you're the owner, you also need to be aware of the property taxes. Improvements will generally end up raising those.\n\nOtherwise, yeah. Fix up and enjoy your home.", "NTA as it seems you have at least some idea what you're getting into.  I'm not certain you understand the full extent of the commitment but you're not in the wrong for wanting to take that path.\n\nIf you want a life partner, you're going to have to be with someone who shares big ideas/dreams like that.  Sounds like the current BF is not one of those.", "NTA \n\nThey cannot force their decision. It is your money at the end and your decision if you want to spend the money to fix the house owned by you rather than choosing their land and get into debt.", "NTA - you had discussed with your boyfriend your plans for your property and fixing up the house, and he didn\u2019t like it but at least you had the decency of discussing it with him. From the sounds of it he didn\u2019t discuss this mobile home plan + $150k debt plan with you at all. You\u2019re entitled to do what you want with the property you own and you\u2019re entitled to not want to get into more debt - if your boyfriend wants to have a mobile home on his parents property he can do that, but he doesn\u2019t get to decide along with his family that you must be part of it as well. \n\nAnd even if you were on board with their mobile home plan the fact that he went behind your back to pick one out and expects you to shoulder a share of $150k debt without having had a say in the home you\u2019d be buying? That\u2019s not right. \n\n\nIt may be time to evaluate how much blending of finances you want to do with this man in the future. He\u2019s already trying to make financial decisions on your behalf and force you into things you\u2019re not on board with and that\u2019s a red flag - your plan places no financial burden on him, his places a LOT on you and ties you to his parents which should things go sour with your relationship is a recipe for disaster.", "NTA. You house, your money, your decision. They can whine all they want.", "INFO: You've been working on houses and redoing roofs since you were 5 but never worked on the house/roof of your fathers home for the 20+ years it needed repairs? After that much time I don't think its a simple 10K-15K roof job plus you stated at first the home wasn't up to code. Will the house be livable after a simple roof repair?", "NTA. They shouldn't just go buy a mobile home and think you are going to jump for joy and move in when you already have a home.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't asking him not to buy a house and repair your father's. You are giving him a clear option but he is not.", "There's a lot to unpack there, and that's without getting into the difference of opinion between you and your boyfriend/his family about how viable it is to fix up the house for a reasonable price.\n\nDo you want to live in your dad's house while renovating it? Do you want to (or already) live with your boyfriend? What is the alternative plan? It sounds like it would take quite a long time to fix up that house to be in liveable condition, so where would you live until then? I can see why your boyfriend might be unhappy if it sounds like your only option for living with him is dependent on large scale expensive renovations that could take years, if he would like to settle down in a long term home with you sooner.\n\nLiving in a mobile home on your (boyfriend's) parent's yard sounds awful too though. I misread it at first and thought the mobile home was a temporary option and that they had also found a proper house for you, but the mobile home in the yard is the $150k house? I may be underestimating the relative sizes of the mobile home and the land, but either way effectively living next door to your in-laws doesn't sound like a good long term plan either. It's definitely not ok for him and his family to be making the decision for you when you'd already told him your plans.\n\nThey might be right that your dad's old house is a money pit, a huge amount of work, and not worth the effort from a time/money point of view. But it's clearly very important to you and your family and it's very unfair of them to not recognise that and just make other plans for you. But it may also be unfair of you to lock all future plans of home ownership with your boyfriend behind a very complex building project.\n\nNTA in the end. Was leaning more towards a simple difference of opinion at first but yeah, the way they tried to just decide your future for you is definitely an AH move on their part.", "Info: would your boyfriend be expected to contribute financially towards the home or repairs? Is his name going to be added to the title?", "NTA. I'm going to be honest after reading through some of your responses, I have to ask what exactly are you getting out of your relationship with your bf? You pay for everything, he doesn't hold down a job, and then he goes and makes a decision that you will have to pay for in the end? You're so young and clearly very mature and responsible. Please reevaluate your relationship. You deserve a partner that works with you and supports you, not one that acts in his own interests and against yours.", "NTA\u2026\u201dhow much is this gift going to cost me???\u201d One of my fave movie lines. \n\nDon\u2019t get bulldozed by this but take a minute who is meddling in your relationship. BF\u2019s family sound very involved and have power of persuasion. Is this what you want for the rest of your life?\n\nIt\u2019s cool if BF wants to live by his parents but he\u2019ll need to consider what his partner wants too.", "Not only are you NTA, your boyfriends family have no understanding of real estate. That 150k mobile home will do nothing but depreciate. If you are cautious, every dollar you put into the home is an investment and you end up with a solid asset for your future.", "You're not obligated to get into debt because of someone else's choices, even your boyfriend's.\n\nNAH but they could be depending on how they keep handling the situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even $10k of just material costs...  What about lead paint and asbestos?  When the house was built suggests both should be expected.\n\nA roof only takes a couple weeks if you're doing it alone and have a day job, but the costs are still significant.  The interior of a house that hasn't had a roof in that long likely needs new wallboards, new insulation, new cabinets, new flooring, new paint... Treatment for mold?  Granted, I live in a desert, but a house standing empty for even 20 years with a bad roof will pretty much have to be ripped down to the studs in *most* rooms.\n\nHow big is this house?  Just plain shingles cost $4 to $5 a square foot. For a 1000 sq ft home, about the size of a single wide, you'd be looking at 10 squares of roofing material.  That's half your budget in materials alone.\n\nIf you clean everything down to the studs and don't have to replace any of them, that would leave $5 to $10k of your estimate for disposal costs, new furnishings, new plumbing, new appliances, etc.\n\nI would not count on the furnace/HVAC still being functional after that much time, or even repairable.  An amazing friend hooked me up with a furnace for what it cost him from his distributor.  With the venting and getting it all up to code? Even with the free labor and discount on the parts? That and the air conditioner basically cost what you have left after the roof.\n\nMy friends consider me pretty good at bargain hunting and renovation work, but I don't think I could take on this project at the costs you're estimating and make it work, even if I didn't have to buy or rent any additional tools.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic I was able to get a pallet of 2x4x8s for $2 a board.

No sinking joists, no leaking pipes, no lead, no mold, no asbestos, no aluminum wiring) for your current predicted expenses.\n\nJust finding somewhere that will accept asbestos and mold contaminated stuff is expensive.
