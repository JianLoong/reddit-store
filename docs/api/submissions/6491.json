The house was built in 1957 so it's been around for a while and isn't up to code. In 1997 the ceiling caved in and my dad not able to fix it at the time decided to move out. My dad just recently told me he wanted me to have it due to him being up there in age and not having the ability to fix it (my dad being 71 me being 21 and more capable to fix it) I just found a stable job and bring in most of the money so I don't mind being the one to fix it. My dad got me power tools for Christmas and as of January 1st 2023 I am now the owner of the property (my dad wanted the date to be ironic so that's why he waited so long). I recently pitched the idea of fixing the house up to my boyfriend and his family as they worry about our finances. And they told me it is just a lost cause. Granted my dad is a car collector and most of his collection is on the property so I can see why some people wouldn't like the idea but I don't mind the cars and I can easily move them over to the lot next door (which my dad still owns). They also told me it would just be a money pit and I had no idea what I was getting into. I've been working on houses since I was 5 years old and I know how to redo the roof due to being taught at a very young age. In all I'm looking at a $10,000 - $15,000 project that's only if I wanted to add an expansion that has already been started. My boyfriend and I went over to his parents house as they wanted to speak with me and they told me that they cleaned off a section of their property to bring a mobile home in. My boyfriend had gone with them and picked out at home for $150,000 and we're planning on having it moved to their property for me and him to live in. They told us we could have their land and all we would have to do is pay off the house. I told them absolutely not due to me already owning my home and land and that I didn't want to get into any debt of any kind. My boyfriend and his parents told me that a house that didn't need to be worked on would be better as I would not need to be BURDENED with my father's misfortunes. I told them that I would continue with fixing up my house and that if my boyfriend wanted to live with his parents that's on him.

So they're the assholes for doing this without consulting you\u2014not that you would have agreed to it, but they needed to *ask* first.", "NTA - they made a sweeping gesture that you\u2019re expected to pay for without asking you.", "NTA \n\nwhy do they think it\u2019s ok for them to just all these decisions for you and decide that you will be paying them money?! The entitlement is unreal. Do not get sucked into paying for someone else\u2019s home. \n\nNot knowing the actual state of the house your dad has given you I can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s a lost cause of not but if your confident that you can get it livable again then go for it. Having a caved in roof sounds like so much work to put right but if it means a lot to you and you want to make it your home then crack on.", "NTA - You don't have kids, you're young, your investment in the property could be worth far more than you put into it, I say go for it!", "I don\u2019t think your the asshole at all - a proper home (let alone one that needs fixing up) sounds much comfier and less hassle than a mobile home \nAlso you\u2019ve got the achievement at the end of the day to add to your portfolio \n\nIn addition, I think fixer uppers give off more character and become more cozier than mobile homes", "I was gonna say N A H because it was just something that you and your boyfriend needed to talk out, but it\u2019s low for him to go behind your back with his parents, pick out a house, and try to forge that decision on you. He didn\u2019t even try to include you in the process of selecting the modular house. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA and based on this I think it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re boyfriend and his family think you\u2019re incompetent (cause they don\u2019t think you can fix up your house) and will try to force you to do whatever they deem to be the correct choice.", "NTA\n\nYou do the house up, he can go live in the caravan in his mum's garden.", "NTA. \n\nA $15k roof job is a far smaller burden than a $150k trailer.

I\u2019d keep finances separate", "NTA.  That said, pay a home inspector to evaluate your house to see what repairs would cost and if it\u2019s actually financially practical.  If it is, you can reassure his family.  If it will be a money pit (better to have know this before you accepted ownership) you\u2019d best sign it over back to dad", "Info: how old are you guys? Are you and boyfriend planning on getting married/sharing a long term future?", "NTA.\n\nBF and family are being pushy and demanding expecting you to take on a huge debt.\n\nMy only concern with your dad's house is if you're the owner, you also need to be aware of the property taxes. Improvements will generally end up raising those.\n\nOtherwise, yeah. Fix up and enjoy your home.", "NTA as it seems you have at least some idea what you're getting into.  I'm not certain you understand the full extent of the commitment but you're not in the wrong for wanting to take that path.\n\nIf you want a life partner, you're going to have to be with someone who shares big ideas/dreams like that.  Sounds like the current BF is not one of those.", "NTA \n\nThey cannot force their decision. It is your money at the end and your decision if you want to spend the money to fix the house owned by you rather than choosing their land and get into debt.", "NTA - you had discussed with your boyfriend your plans for your property and fixing up the house, and he didn\u2019t like it but at least you had the decency of discussing it with him. From the sounds of it he didn\u2019t discuss this mobile home plan + $150k debt plan with you at all. You\u2019re entitled to do what you want with the property you own and you\u2019re entitled to not want to get into more debt - if your boyfriend wants to have a mobile home on his parents property he can do that, but he doesn\u2019t get to decide along with his family that you must be part of it as well. \n\nAnd even if you were on board with their mobile home plan the fact that he went behind your back to pick one out and expects you to shoulder a share of $150k debt without having had a say in the home you\u2019d be buying? That\u2019s not right. \n\n\nIt may be time to evaluate how much blending of finances you want to do with this man in the future. He\u2019s already trying to make financial decisions on your behalf and force you into things you\u2019re not on board with and that\u2019s a red flag - your plan places no financial burden on him, his places a LOT on you and ties you to his parents which should things go sour with your relationship is a recipe for disaster.", "NTA. You house, your money, your decision. They can whine all they want.", "INFO: You've been working on houses and redoing roofs since you were 5 but never worked on the house/roof of your fathers home for the 20+ years it needed repairs? After that much time I don't think its a simple 10K-15K roof job plus you stated at first the home wasn't up to code. Will the house be livable after a simple roof repair?", "NTA. They shouldn't just go buy a mobile home and think you are going to jump for joy and move in when you already have a home.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't asking him not to buy a house and repair your father's. You are giving him a clear option but he is not.", "There's a lot to unpack there, and that's without getting into the difference of opinion between you and your boyfriend/his family about how viable it is to fix up the house for a reasonable price.\n\nDo you want to live in your dad's house while renovating it? Do you want to (or already) live with your boyfriend? What is the alternative plan? It sounds like it would take quite a long time to fix up that house to be in liveable condition, so where would you live until then? I can see why your boyfriend might be unhappy if it sounds like your only option for living with him is dependent on large scale expensive renovations that could take years, if he would like to settle down in a long term home with you sooner.\n\nLiving in a mobile home on your (boyfriend's) parent's yard sounds awful too though. I misread it at first and thought the mobile home was a temporary option and that they had also found a proper house for you, but the mobile home in the yard is the $150k house? I may be underestimating the relative sizes of the mobile home and the land, but either way effectively living next door to your in-laws doesn't sound like a good long term plan either. It's definitely not ok for him and his family to be making the decision for you when you'd already told him your plans.\n\nThey might be right that your dad's old house is a money pit, a huge amount of work, and not worth the effort from a time/money point of view. But it's clearly very important to you and your family and it's very unfair of them to not recognise that and just make other plans for you. But it may also be unfair of you to lock all future plans of home ownership with your boyfriend behind a very complex building project.\n\nNTA in the end. Was leaning more towards a simple difference of opinion at first but yeah, the way they tried to just decide your future for you is definitely an AH move on their part.", "Info: would your boyfriend be expected to contribute financially towards the home or repairs? Is his name going to be added to the title?", "NTA. I'm going to be honest after reading through some of your responses, I have to ask what exactly are you getting out of your relationship with your bf? You pay for everything, he doesn't hold down a job, and then he goes and makes a decision that you will have to pay for in the end? You're so young and clearly very mature and responsible. Please reevaluate your relationship. You deserve a partner that works with you and supports you, not one that acts in his own interests and against yours.", "NTA\u2026\u201dhow much is this gift going to cost me???\u201d One of my fave movie lines. \n\nDon\u2019t get bulldozed by this but take a minute who is meddling in your relationship. BF\u2019s family sound very involved and have power of persuasion. Is this what you want for the rest of your life?\n\nIt\u2019s cool if BF wants to live by his parents but he\u2019ll need to consider what his partner wants too.", "Not only are you NTA, your boyfriends family have no understanding of real estate. That 150k mobile home will do nothing but depreciate. If you are cautious, every dollar you put into the home is an investment and you end up with a solid asset for your future.", "You're not obligated to get into debt because of someone else's choices, even your boyfriend's.\n\nNAH but they could be depending on how they keep handling the situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not just a 15k roof job, it's likely a full internal gut job at this point because the interior has not been protected from the elements/from wet/from mold for 20+ years.", "My dad had a home inspector come out the day he signed it over. He told us the house structure is intact it would just need a new roof of 1/2 of the place cause we already fixed the other half. Electrical would need to be brought up to code and it would need a septic tank cause it was built in a time cesspools were legal.  Said in all if it were done by us (me and my dad) it would be as low as $8000 to do.", "We are both 21 and we were planning on getting married but due to me telling him that I would continue my plans he said he's reconsidering.", "I just paid the property taxes which ended up being $200 but yeah I don't mind if the taxes increase anything beats $850 rent.", "In all it's a 10k project. The house isn't that big and in 2018 I redid half of the roof it costed $3000 to do. That's only because we didn't need to pay for the labor cost and had some of the supplies.( We bought all the supplies needed for the entire roof so I probably won't have to pay anything)  The plumbing was redone in 96 and would need a touch up. Electrical would need to be brought up to code and a furnace would need to be hooked up along with a septic tank put in but over all I'm looking at a 10k to 15k project.", "So my boyfriend and I are renting an apartment together which I'll be living in until the house is done and on another note my boyfriend cannot hold down a job so I am currently paying for everything (rent bills groceries) so as I'm looking at it if I were to stay in the $150k house on his parents property I more than likely will be the one paying for it. But if I were to fix up the house I would only be paying a lot for a little amount of time and I wouldn't need to worry about anything other than bills if I were to do this.

The entire building is made of concrete and brick aside from the roof so I'm not too worried about cleaning any mold out (I've been in there a couple times and it sounds worse than it is) gutting it would not be too difficult since before the ceiling incident my dad had started to gut it because he wanted to add an expansion on the house.

I didn\u2019t see it but this place is paid off correct and it\u2019s an actual built structure?

Focus on your house and yourself and let him go figure out how to adult.", "So they wanted you to pay for a home you didn\u2019t want and had no say in choosing? While he did what exactly? Claimed half ownership and while he and his parents controlled your life and he\u2019s sitting on his behind? \n\n\nYou need to get out of this relationship, immediately.", "Keep everything in your name. For your own security, not his.", "According to a quick Google search and https://factorydirectmobilehomes.com/ 40k is low end.", "While I think you're NTA regarding whatever the heck your boyfriend is trying to get you involved in, I think that you and your father are letting an emotional attachment to this house override clearly thinking about whether the amount of effort you're going to have to invest to make this old house livable, is worth it.", "He's a retired mechanic and contractor", "The plumbing was redone in 96 and would need a touch up but the inspector said it was up to date. And my dad is in pretty good health my dad is a retired contractor and mechanic so he knows the ins and outs of everything. And I have checked the permits the town I'm in doesn't really care (it being a rural place and all) I just for safety I want it to be up to code. Once I'm done with everything I will be hiring professionals to look over what has been done.", "Kitchens are generally going to be your most expensive cost of a house. That said, it all depends on what you will be happy with. I gutted and refloored, rewired reinsulated and replumbed my house for less then 8,000. So it is possible.", "The more OP talks the more this house sounds like a money pit.\n\nHer Dad is a car collector? Or is more like a bunch of rusted broken down cars that have been sitting in the elements for years.\n\nDad is in his 70's and this house has been sitting for years. Yeah OP I think your painting this house being an easy fix...and it is not!\nJust from all the additional comments the work and money it might take to fix this house could exceed 150,000.00.\n\nBrand new mobile homes built now are actually pretty amazing. Why not have both properties?\n\nI vote that OP gets a second home inspection with boyfriend...not have Dad there. Then discuss is this really worth it?\n\nThe broken down cars definitely bring down the property value whether they are on the property or nextdoor.\n\nYTA OP....sorry but I think you are wearing rose colored glasses.", "This!", "I'm pretty sure they're against OP fixing her house only because in that case 1) She will be independent from them (by assets and by being away) and 2) Her bf wouldn't be \"man of the house\" as house is not his", "They were already making arrangements for it to be done when we got there they just needed me to sign the paperwork (which I refused to do)", "15ftx30ft it's 450sqft and half of the roof is already done", "That's also a limited area of the us not a picture as a whole and factory direct is not how most people purchase mobile homes. You also failed to include transportation and install of the home which are added costs. So add that in because it's all part of the cost and 150 is low end for a newly installed mobile home", "if they think it\u2019s worth it, that\u2019s all that matters. bf can buy the modular with his parents and live on their land if he wants but OP is under no obligation to do the same if they don\u2019t want to.\n\nedit: typo", "Even if they had to put 100k into the house to make it livable and nice, it'd still be a cheap as fuck house \ud83d\ude02", "You are completely right here - OP does not sound as if they having any fricking clue of what they are taking on. \n\nIt's been abandoned and half the roof collapsed since 1997.\n\nThere is a zero percent chance on 10k$ bringing it up to code. Zero.", "They What?!? They couldn't have done this without access to your credit and financial info, including your social. You need to check your credit now, And lock everything down. I would also suggest changing banks. At the very least remove your SO from any accounts. They are trying to turn you into their ATM.", "Bloody hell. This isn\u2019t just a red flag it\u2019s a whole field of red flags.", "Yikes. NTA. It's ridiculous they tried to make a unilateral decision about *your* life without you. Bad start to a partnership.", "Transportation of a new trailer isn't going to take up 110k. If it does then the transport company is scamming you.", "They were the ones who showed me how to open a bank account so of course they kept my information. Nothing has changed as I've checked everything. I asked my bank to notify me of every change made even withdrawals. They call every time I buy my lunch for work.", "Hell yes it is. Get out now!", "Transportation running power and water in and sewage out setting the foundation. Are all expenses that have to be paid. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That just means they have been hiding under the guise of \"helping\" you for a long time. Good job keeping an eye on your account but that has nothing to do with your credit. You really need to check it. Mobile home financers don't just prepare lending paperwork. They do hard credit pulls. If you have never borrowed money, then who's credit history did they use? Does your SO have debt you don't know about?", "You may want to talk to the bank about switching account numbers just in case.", "I'd lock down my credit if I were you; they already have enough info to steal your identity and really, that's what they have done. It's just a hop, skip, and a jump to them forging your signature on those papers. You might want to consider speaking to an attorney because them using your info without your permission crosses a line.", "Close that account and open a new one. Even if they don\u2019t withdraw any money. Do you really want your boyfriend\u2019s parents monitoring every cent you spend?", "This is crossing a major line and deeply abusive. Close the bank account, open a new one with a different bank entirely, and put a freeze on your credit. \n\nThis isn\u2019t normal and it\u2019s only going to get worse. These people are setting you up for a lifetime of control, manipulation, and abuse.", "This is really alarming. I would completely close down the account and open a new one elsewhere. Additionally lock down your credit.  I'd even go so far as to dispute the credit check they issued on your social which would have likely been required to make the purchase.  This is beyond unacceptable and potentially criminal of them.", "All of those expenses are on the bfs parents though. That's improvements to their land. It shouldn't be packaged into the trailer mortgage she would have been signing for. Like I said, they're scamming her."]}
