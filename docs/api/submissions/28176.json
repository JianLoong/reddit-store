Anne is my only sibling and this is her first baby. My dad pass away 4 year ago and it  only been mom, Anne and me for a long time. Mom and I have been really excited to welcome a new member of the family. Since Anne is my only sibling, I thought (assumed) I would be the baby's godmother. My sister made it seem I would until her husband told her I would need to be married in order to be the godmother. I'm very much single and have no plans to marry. I  don't think it in the cards for me. I was sad to hear this  and kept how upset I was to my self. If the catholic church says I can't be a godmother then who am I to argue. I took Anne to the Prego Expo, along with our mom. We started talking about the baby shower and doing a little planning during and following the expo. Today I go a text message from Anne, telling me the date and location of the baby shower. I asked her why she was doing it in that location since we talked about another location. She said her husband's brother and his wife liked that place and they wanted a DJ at the baby shower and for it to be a party. I was taken a bit back since I thought mom and I would be doing the planning. Especially since mom will be paying for the location and she has a limited income.   Anne then proceeded to send me screen shots of table center pieces and shower decorations that she wanted me to make for the shower. I was upset and it took me a minute to understand why I was crying. My plan was to ignore her for a few hours while I settled my feels. But she kept messaging, demanding a response and I finally texted her back. I told her I was upset about not being a godmother and that I felt her husband's family was taking over the planning and how my feelings where hurt. Anne texted back that its her husband, that she never confirmed the location and that I'm making no sense. I texted Anne back, telling her that  helping plan means involvement, and that I felt like I was not involved instead I was being told when things are happening and rudely being told I needed to do the decorations.  I also texted Anne that I clearly misunderstood my level of involvement and that I felt I was justify upset but that I will get over it. She has not responded.  My mom is now mad at me for upsetting Anne and she worried it will affect the baby. So now I feel like crap. I know it's Anne's decision on how much I am or am not involved in.

My husband isn\u2019t a baptised anything and we still had no issues getting our sons baptised.

Be a fun and great aunt, it\u2019s not a big difference. \n\nMy guess on the godmother thing is that they would prefer to pick a couple. I know that sometimes couples are picked due to the connections and being able to have someone to turn to as a united pair. Does not technically need to be the case, but that is my best guess.", "YTA, what a couple decides to do with their baby is theirs and theirs alone. You aren't the asshole for feeling disappointed or sad, but those feelings are your own to deal with.\n\nForeclosure with this next part, you mentioned catholicism and I'll be honest, I'm not familiar with the religious aspects of god parenthood so I'm only speaking from a legal perspective here forward.\n\nThe husband has a point about marriage, raising a child is hard and is especially hard as a single parent. If I had a child, I would also be considering who would be the most strategic person for them to go to in the event of my and my partners death. A single parent wouldn't be ideal, unless you had the finances and free time to back it up. If theres someone on his side of the family with more stability, then theyre just simply the better option for the child's sake. \n\nI really just wanna stress here that you shouldn't feel its a slight. It doesn't inherently mean they think you'd be a bad parent, or wouldn't trust you to raise their child, its just when you become a parent you think about that stuff. Its not about their feelings, it's about the best outcome for the child, who in that worst case scenario, is already going to have A LOT going on dealing with that kind of grief. I know people who have and work with these types of kids, its not easy. Kids who have experienced trauma like that will need a lot of expensive therapy and counseling to get through it, along with a LOT of their new caregivers time. Most single people would struggle with that kind of responsibility. Hell most couples will too.\n\n\n\nAs for the party, that I don't really think youre an Asshole about (I honestly think \"asshole\" is too strong a word for your whole experience here lol, but thats just the conventions of the sub). I think it could have been communicated better and its good to let your sister know you want to be more involved in her pregnancy and want to celebrate with her more, but you also have to remember he's having a baby too. This is just as exciting for his side of the family as well, everyone has to share. I think it does suck how that all went down, but I also think its not worth making a big deal about. Maybe you can just throw a separate, small little party yourself for you and your immediate family to celebrate her too. No reason she can't have multiple parties!", "YTA. This is not about you, this is about your sister. And honey you don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re ready to be a Godmother. You realize that if something was to happen to them, that would make you a single parent? That\u2019s an entire human to take care of yourself. This is their kid NOT yours.", "You are the arse. You sister and bil are entitled to as they please without your permission. Having said that you are also entitled to respond as you please to real/ perceived grievances. I think you were wrong to lash out at your pregnant sister, it's still early days 3 months along and extra stress can lead to miscarriage. Just let your sister be and complain to some one else to process your emotions.", "TBF Godparents usually take the baby in if his birth parents die. I\u2019d want my kid living in a stable household\u2026 the legal protections and restrictions of marriage are usually part of that.", "You assumed, that makes YTA\n\nGodparents, if you\u2019re following the tradition, is who is best to raise the kid.  Blood related doesn\u2019t automatically make you the best.  \n\nAre you married was the first question I asked before getting to that part of the post.  It\u2019s about baby not you\n\nAs to baby shower there probably is some miscommunication happening but your unresolved feelings are probably twisting it a lot.  You need to step back and sort that first", "YTA. Stop making your sister\u2019s pregnancy all about you. You don\u2019t meet the requirements to be the godmother. Catholic church has their rules and qualifications for godparents including being baptized, first communion, confirmation, being in good standing (i.e. not living in \u201csin\u201d with a man you are not married to). They also make you take one short class about your responsibilities as a godparent.

I am Catholic but do not practise. \nI was not married for 8/10 of the ceremonies. \n\nSome parishes are more strict than others about having to be Catholic and practising. I have never heard of the married rule however.", "I think maybe this is another reason why I was so upset. Before my sister married, she was a social butterfly with a large group of friends. I was the weird introverted one.  Her two best friends for most of her life are gay and her husband did not want them at the wedding. They don't speak to her anymore. She has had a falling out with most of her friends and now she as no real friends.  While i know people's lives change when they get married, having no friends is weird.  Mom and I have talked about our worry that she is being isolated and that one day her husband might try to isolate us from her. Which is way mom keeps quiet on some of the things she might not agree with regarding her marriage, lack of friends and general isolation. This whole godmother/baby shower thing is making is trigger this worry.", "this is made all the more likely by the fact that you definitely do not have to be married in order to be a godparent in the catholic church. if you\u2019ve gotten married, but not in a church, you\u2019ll sometimes have to be \u201cremarried\u201d in a catholic church before they allow it, but absolutely no rule whatsoever on people who are not married at all. \n\nafter i read that i was waiting for the part that OP finds this out and confronts her sister about what the real reason is, but then the in-laws planning a \u201cparty\u201d for a baby shower? that OP\u2019s mom is paying for? this whole thing is wild and just so NTA.", ">If the catholic church says I can't be a godmother then who am I to argue.\n\nReligion weaponized with a lie.

My nephews were all baptised, and they did some juggling to get a Catholic godparent for each", "You're right, the important thing is that I'm going to be an auntie. So the husband is old school with a good amount of machismo sprinkled in. It's hard to tell from the outside looking in what their dynamic is. I get the vibe that he's very good at swaying her to his point of view and he likes keeping an eye on her. Recently they fought  because he got mad that she came home from work 30 minutes late. I know he and his mother told her that couples should be doing things together like grocery shopping or going to the store. That it's not right for a married woman to be running around by herself.  That is  just asking for trouble. Anne will wait for him to go to the grocery store, to do laundry or visit  mom and I. Since she's been married she has not once visited me and mom. She'll wait for her husband to bring her. The lack of independence in her marriage is odd to me. I never been married, so I don't really know how married couple should act. But I just keep getting the feeling that it's controlling and this whole pregnancy, baby shower/godparents thing is just  more of that", "I don't think stepping back is a good idea, from other comments it sounds like the husband is trying to isolate the sister", "I think the marriage thing applies if she is in a relationship and cohabitating. You can always lie but that is just bad karma. If she is single she is good.", "When is the last time you have gone to a Baptism. Things have changed. They were way more lax about this back in the day. Some Parishes are more stricter than others. I know plenty of people who weren\u2019t able to be the godparent. They were surprised because they previously had your experience with Baptisms.", "Godparents are a Catholic concept, not a legal one. Legally speaking, at least in the US and Canada, tutors must be appointed in a will or in court if there was no will. A church ceremony is not a will. I am a single godmother to two children. I am designated tutor in case of death to my goddaughter/niece (as well as to her brother), but not to my godson. The only role of a godparent is to guide children into faith (which makes me the worst godmother ever being pretty much atheist, but apparently my sister and friend just wanted the great gifts). That being said, I agree that OP's sister is absolutely entitled to choose whoever she wants as godparents for whatever reasons. It's cruel enough to have to choose between your loved ones, the guilt trip sucks even more.", "Being a godparent in the Catholic church is not the same as guardianship. Their role is to guide the child in support of a religious upbringing. Like a faith guide. We are Anglican and our kids godparents are basically just like honorary aunts and uncles. That being said, single women can be parents and guardians these days. My husband's sister was single and she would have gotten my kids if something happened to us.", "And you don't need to make those table decorations, if she doesn't want your in put, you don't need to contribute. She can't have everything.", "So, technically, in order to be a godparent, you have to be a practicing Catholic who has been christened, gone through your first communion, and gone through confirmation. You are supposed to belong to the parish, and be an active member of your parish, although it does not need to be the parish that the child's family belongs to. If you are married, Y you are supposed to have been married in a Catholic service, or had your marriage blessed by a Catholic priest. \n\nThere are lots of parish priests who are a lot less restrictive/ flexible/look the other way, but those are the technical formal restrictions as set out by Canon Law.\n\nI mean, my father is a formal Catholic godfather to two of my cousins, and my father's Jewish. He does technically meet them. Married requirements though, since he and my mother got married in both a full Catholic service and a full Jewish service, but my dad did not convert, and in fact is still a more or less quasi-practicing Reform Jew. In his case, both priests wanted assurances that should he and my mother become the guardian of the child, that he would raise them Catholic, which was a promise he had no issue making, because he absolutely would have. As it turns out, as with most godparents, he didn't have to live up to that promise, because my aunts and uncles are still around and my cousins are all now over the age of 20 anyway. But he would have if he had to, there were never any questions about that.", "But you have be Catholic and received all sacraments of initiativion.", "Your Catholic Church doesn\u2019t care.

I went from very social and connected with many social circles and friends to staying at home with kids, no friends, hardly speaking to my family, no access to a car or even our bank account, while he stayed out late and did whatever he wanted. I allowed him to slowly small myself and it took many years after our divorce to find myself again. 20 years later and it still sneaks up on me, even though I now am with an amazing man who wants me to shine.

It has *never* been a requirement, as far as I know.  So if some parishes are now demanding that godparents be married, it is not because they are \u201cless lax\u201d but because they have invented a new requirement.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that some priests have objected to unmarried godparents, but I wonder if it is because though \u201cunmarried,\u201d these prospective godparents were not \u201csingle.\u201d  More and more it has become the norm for people to live together and even start families before they marry. Possibly the issue for some priests is not that a prospective godparent is unmarried but that they are not practicing pre-marital celibacy. \n\nReturning to OP\u2019s situation, the issue may not be that she is unmarried but that she may be (perceived as) sexually active.  Or it may be an excuse because bil has another choice for godparents.", "God parents are a legal part too, its a legal agreement to take over in the event of death. I'm aware there is a religious aspect to it, my friend is catholic, but there is very much a legal side of it too that can (or can not) be correlated to the religious side. Your religious god parent can also have the legal rights if you filed that paperwork, but can also just purely be spiritual god parents without any legal rights.\n\nMy cousin was my and my sister's legal god parent in the event of my parents deaths growing up, there was legal paperwork signed and filed away to make the transition easier and to prevent other family members from attempting to take us. Bc without it, law defaults to next of kin, which would have been my grandparents. \n\nMy parents are non religious though lol, my dad's just a lawyer so he knows how messy custody battles can be and wanted to ensure we were left with capable family members in the worst case situation.", "Traditionally, there are two godparents - one male, one female. But, only one godparent has to be Catholic as only one is required by Canon law. \n\nMy youngest has his Catholic godfather (who was unmarried ant the time)  and my sister-in-law, the mainstream Protestant, as his godmother.
