I consider her my best friend and neither of us saw us being friends as wrong or strange until are teens.\n\nWe grew up in a relatively small town so it wasn\u2019t long before our families and friends started questioning me and Ashley\u2019s relationship and so did we. We did attempt dating and it went fine until it went farther. I knew Ashley is and was a very attractive girl but that never stuck out to me. We tried to sleep together but we had to stop because it just felt so wrong. I confessed to her that I think she\u2019s amazing but I view her more as my sister/best friend. Thankfully she felt the same and we continued with our friendship the say we used to be.\n\nI would also like to add I have a brother, Carl 32M who I was never really close to. Our parents divorced and he went with our dad and I remained with our mom so I only saw him 2-3 weekends a month. I viewed Ashley more as a sibling then I did him.\n\nNow to lord present day I met my wife Zoe 27f about 6 years ago through a few mutual friends. Her and Ashly were pretty close and eventually me and Zoe got close. We started staying around 4 years ago and our wedding recently passed. Zoe was fully aware of me and Ashley\u2019s \u201crelationship\u201d and she said she didn\u2019t mind. Ashley even offered in private to Zoe that she would try to withdraw a bit to make Zoe comfortable but Zoe said not to. I would like to add that when me and Zoe began going out I was still hanging out with Ashley just now with Zoe.\n\nWhen it came to choosing maid of honors and groomsmen I was having a hard time picking my best man. I had a few close make friends but no real best male friend. Zoe suggested  Ashley and I really liked the idea. Zoe and I are both fans of The Big Bang Theory so she took the idea from Sheldon and Amy\u2019s wedding. I asked Zoe numerous times if she was really ok with and she told me I should have my best friend up there like she\u2019ll have hers. To get ti the point quicker Ashley said yes and she was my best man (She even wore a suit). The wedding was amazing and it was truly the best night of my life. I got to marry the love of my life with the support of my family and friends.\n\nMy brother a few days ago (a groomsmen) called me and immediately began to berate me for not making him my best man. Saying it was humiliating see Ashley take \u201chis\u201d place. I tried to reason with him but he screamed that I also was probably sleeping with her. I ended up yelling at him for this accusation because he knows how much I love Zoe. We haven\u2019t talked and I\u2019ve told Zoe this but I haven\u2019t told Ashley.\n\nWas I the asshole for having my female best friend be my best man instead of my brother?\n\nEdit 1: I forgot to add that Ashley is in fact dating someone they\u2019re non-binary and they seem very happy together. I will not be revealing they\u2019re biological gender as I feel that disrespects they\u2019re privacy and Ashley relationship.", "created_utc": 1691905261, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pqlwi/aita_for_having_my_female_best_friend_be_my_best/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You know this because you had a lovely wedding and you and Zoe were very happy. Your brother is just butthurt and needs to suck it up. NTA", "NTA- Why did he even agree to be a groomsman if he was just going to throw a hissy after about it? Your wedding, your choice on best man. Sounds like you chose well.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that he jumped to berating you for having your best friend is misguided. Many people don\u2019t have traditional wedding parties. Glad you had a wonderful day!", "Let's summarize:\n1. Ashley is your best friend/sibling. You tried to have a relationship but it wasn't right\n2. Your wife, Zoe knows this and is okay with this\n3. Zoe suggested Ashley to be your best man as Ashley is your BFF, and all 3 of you were happy woth it\n4. Enter your brother, who you see few times a month, are not close to, believes it was \"his position\"\n\nInf: NTA, but your brother is incredibly entitled. Also, you are pretty lucky to have a friend/sister like Ashley and a wife like Zoe", "NTA nobody gets to dictate who your best man/woman/person is. \nYour brother is just jealous. \nI'm LOVING how healthy the relationship between you, Zoe and Ashley is. Just .... yes!!!", "NTA. Your wedding, your rules.", "NTA.   Your 'best person' should be your closest friend, or at the very least the one who can best handle the responsibilities of the role (which for some people is as simple as making sure you are where you need to be and for others requires planning parties and wrangling the rest of the groomspeople).   While I can understand your brother might have felt hurt that he wasn't chosen as your best man, that's definitely something a mature adult would keep to themselves.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding not your brothers.  Your brother is definitely the asshole.  You get to choose your best person regardless of gender.", "NTA.\n\nThe only person that could call you an asshole in this situation was your wife and she didn't care. You are good to go.", "NTA - she's your best mate, it's your wedding, it's none of his business who you pick for what role", "NTA. I think your brother may have thought of you and him as closer than you did and felt hurt because of this. Alternatively, he's just very conservative. Either way you did nothing wrong.", "NTA!\n\nJust because your brother is a man, that doesn\u2019t make him the default. I\u2019m so happy that you had a good wedding and chose to have her as your best woman. I think he might just be insecure because your relationship together isn\u2019t what he wants it to be. He shouldn\u2019t take that insecurity out on you though.", "NTA. My 'best man' was my sister. My brother's best man was his oldest friend. Neither of us felt slighted; and we are not even estranged. Invite him as anguest if things are civil between you, but the wedding party is for people who have supported you and your spouse.", "NTA. Is your brother married? If yes, were you his best man?", "NTA\n\nIf anyone asks or he brings it up again, your brother's phone call is a perfect example of why you didn't ask him.\n\n\"I wanted a 'best person' who knows me very well and whole heartedly accepts my wishes. This person is Ashley. Carl's behavior after the wedding really brought home the reasons I hadn't chosen him. I don't like that he was upset, but this kind of thing is exactly why we aren't closer.\"", "NTA\n\nSiblings are not entitled to a place in the wedding party. It is not a birthright. \n\nMy brother and I stopped speaking for a few years because he was so mad he wasn't a groomsman at my wedding. (He hadn't been speaking to me 9 months before when we were making the bridal party so I am not sure why he was surprised).", "NTA - curious, would Zoe agree to your brother being the maid of honor? Guessing not but maybe worth a laugh to ask given the situation.", "Bruh wtf lol my sister got married and I wasn't even in the wedding party. We both knew I wasn't gonna be able to be there when the wedding planning started and the set date was 2 away. Within those 2 years I went no contact with our entire adoptive family anyways and several of them were invited to her wedding so even if I did manage to figure life and finances enough to go I still wouldn't go for that reason. Its sad sure but I'm not upset by it. My sister and I are both terrible people and we are constantly at each other's throats if we are even talking to each other. I was never gonna be a bridesmaid much less her maid of honor lol", "My husband had his twin sister as his best \u201cman\u201d and it was perfect. If your brother has such a problem with it he should excuse himself from your wedding. NTA", "NTA. It is your decision and imho best man/MOH should be for someone who is close to you and you have a good relationship with them. Your brother does not fill that role in your life but Ashley does. He gets angry, takes it out on you and then insults your marriage by implying you\u2019re sleeping with Ashley. Honestly I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d have any kind of relationship with a sibling who could say that Or if I\u2019d even want one.", "NTA\n\nThe person standing next to you should be the person you trust most to support you on your big day (after your future husband or wife of course).\n\nIt is up to you to choose who that person should be, and if that person is a female best friend, then they are the one that should be standing there.\n\nIt can hurt some people to find out that your relationship is perhaps a little more one sided that they thought when they find out that person isn't them, but ultimately there is no real way around that fact.", "NTA if zoe don't mind it your brother shouldn't tell you who allow to be your best man.", "NTA but FYI there is no reason to disclose a non-binary persons assigned gender at birth in this context.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice. No-one is entitled to be your best man.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nyou needed Zoe's permission and not your brother's.\nBut yeah, he is your brother and is allowed to feel hurt.", "YTA\n\nYou've gotta pick your brother there. Picking a girl best man is fine if there's no obvious guy choice, but in this case it makes it look like you told your brother \"I'd rather put a girl in a suit than pick you.\" The line about you two sleeping together was too far though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ashley is basically a life-long friend and sibling. someone who is MUCH more important to the bride than a brother-in-name only. \n\nBest people are normally chosen for a reason.
